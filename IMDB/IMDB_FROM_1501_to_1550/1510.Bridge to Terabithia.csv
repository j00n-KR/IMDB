0,TheLittleSongbird,"Beautiful, charming and touching fantasy film",9,14 April 2010,"Based on Katherine Patterson's beautiful book, Bridge to Terabithia is a beautiful, charming and touching fantasy film, that serves as an emotionally rich testament to the life-changing power of friendship. The film does start off a little slow, as the two protagonists at first interact quite awkwardly, but fifteen minutes in the pacing picked up. I was pleasantly surprised by how quickly the film went. The story is quite simple, as Jess and Leslie encounter mundane daily experiences and become inseparable as a result by their alienation and creativity, but it is an effective one and respects reasonably the story of the book. Also the script ensures that the characters are believable; Jess and Leslie certainly are believable as characters, and Gabor Csupo, who also directed the surprisingly good and underrated Secret of Moonacre, tackles the issues explored in the film with wit and sensitivity.Visually and technically, I couldn't fault Bridge to Terabithia. Moonacre is a little better in the costume and sets department but Terabithia succeeds much better in the depth and character departments. Here the cinematography is fluid, the scenery is stunning and the costumes are very nice. Terabithia itself is like a homage to CS Lewis's Chronicles of Narnia and is very attractive, the final shot of the film was like looking at a painting and the creatures while you don't see much of them are pretty much fantastical. The music score I have to say was beautiful, with a soaring main theme and some other pretty tunes to add to the film's charm.And of course the performances are wonderful. Josh Hutcherson is absolutely brilliant as Jess, he was truly believable and his acting in the final segment was close to heart breaking. AnnaSophia Robb is enchanting as Leslie, she looked lovely and acted with a lot of heart. Her character's death people complained of bringing down the film. I had no problem with it, while it was deeply affecting the way the actors and director brought it across gave the scene itself and the scenes afterwards a real sense of poignancy. Is it just me though, or don't Hutcherson and Robb have great chemistry together? I think so, their chemistry for me was what made the film so charming. The lovely Zooey Deschannel isn't given as much to do, but she has a relevant role to the film which she delivers with a sensitivity and luminosity that I never knew she had. And Robert Patrick is a great actor, and gives another great performance as the gruff and no nonsense father. Plus Bailie Maddison is really cute as Jess's sister.Overall, a really good film. Shame the advertising was so misleading. 9/10 Bethany Cox",Bridge to Terabithia
1,Leofwine_draca,Full of sickly sentiment,4,20 December 2015,"Watching BRIDGE TO TERABITHIA, I'm reminded once again why I avoid American kid's films as a whole: they're far too twee and sentimental, heavy-handed when it comes to the moralising, and most American child actors are intensely annoying. At least the '80s wave of 'kid gang' films like STAND BY ME, THE GOONIES, and THE MONSTER SQUAD avoided all that and featured endearing and realistic children.Sadly, BRIDGE TO TERABITHIA is a rather dull effort about a couple of self-centred children who enter a world of imagination populated by giant creatures and woodland spirits. Of course, all of this is an aid to escape the confines of everyday life, populated by the usual uncaring parents and school bullies.The film is saddled with the sullen-looking Josh Hutcherson (THE HUNGER GAMES) as the lead, and he's one of those people with a face you'd like to slap. Still, Anna Sophia Robb is better, although the film is saddled with an oh-so-kooky turn from the irritating Zooey Deschanel in support. Watch out for Robert Patrick, playing Hutcherson's father. The CGI effects in this film are weird and quite poor, and for large sections I was uninterested in what was taking place on screen, although there is an unexpected and rather good plot twist that stops it from being one of the worst.",Bridge to Terabithia
2,SnoopyStyle,Good performances from the kids,8,25 October 2014,"Jesse Aarons (Josh Hutcherson) is picked on at school, and is forced to wear his sister's hand-me-down sneakers. His father (Robert Patrick) is a poor farmer. Leslie Burke (AnnaSophia Robb) is new in school. Jesse strives to be the fastest runner but then he gets beat by the new girl. It turns out that she's their neighbor. She is an imaginative writer and he's constantly drawing in his book. He's infatuated with the music teacher Ms. Edmunds (Zooey Deschanel). At first, he doesn't like the new girl but he finds her to be a fellow traveler bullied by the other kids. Together, they find a worn out rope swing. They create the imaginary fantasy land of Terabithia just across the creek.There is a big twist in the movie that turns this into something more than a run-of-the-mill kids movie. It's a fine kids movie for most of the film with great performances from Hutcherson and especially Robb. It's not too sugary. The characters have great personalities and good emotions. It's not the first time that this twist happened in a family movie. It is a big surprise when it happens because it's not really hinted at. This one is done well.",Bridge to Terabithia
3,Hitchcoc,Does Justice to a Really Fine Book,9,8 January 2017,"There are lots of books about kids who don't fit in. There are lots of books about bullying. The movie industry has created scripts, utilizing these personalities and showing their struggles. This movie rises above the ordinary. It's a fantasy film that is also a love story. What is real? What is in the mind? It doesn't matter because love and friendship supersede a setting that some would say is impossible. The boy and girl create a world where they can get away from unfulfilled lives and revel in a kind of medieval ethos. They face monsters and trolls and other forces, but that is what gives them life. As they make their respective ways through Terabithia, outside factors begin to resolve themselves and an embracing of the the real world happens. Watch this with your kid.",Bridge to Terabithia
4,Prismark10,Feeling like outsiders,6,22 December 2018,"Bridge to Terabithia is a tween fantasy film. Set in rural America. Jesse Aarons (Josh Hutcherson) is from a poor farming family, his sneakers has expired from overuse and is now forced to wear his sister's hand me down pink trainers.At school he gets picked on, but Jesse is a fast runner. Things change when a new girl arrives in class. Leslie Burke (AnnaSophia Robb) is a faster runner. Leslie's house has no television, she relies on her imagination.Jesse is always drawing. Jesse and Leslie find an old treehouse that they reach with a rope swing to cross a stream. To them it is the fantasy land of Terabithia with trolls and monsters. Both develop a friendship where they use their imagination and art skill to take on the bullies.This is a sweet and touching tale undercut by a tragic event. Hutcherson is very good at doing a sullen face. It does try to dig a little deeper to a life that is not always chocolate and roses. The school is horrible, overrun with bullies who always get their way. One of the bully's for example has a miserable life and all she wanted was a bit of tenderness.",Bridge to Terabithia
5,claudio_carvalho,How to Spoil a Pleasant and Sweet Tale of Friendship and Imagination with an Unnecessary Tragedy,6,4 January 2008,"The country boy Jesse Aarons (Josh Hutcherson) is an artistically talented only son of a low class family that lives in the country with his four sisters and his parents. He feels needy of attention at home and he is outcast in the Lark Creek School, having trouble with the bully mates. However, his life changes with the arrival of the newcomer Leslie Burke (AnnaSophia Robb), the daughter of a couple of writers that moves to the next door house. Jesse and Leslie become close friends, and the imaginative girl creates Terabithia with him, a kingdom of their own with trolls, monsters, furred vultures and ogres. With the fantasy, the life of Jesse becomes bearable until the day a tragedy happens.After watching ""Bridge to Terabithia"" I immediately recalled my disappointment with the 1991 ""My Girl"". In both movies, there is a common and unnecessary tragedy that spoils a pleasant and sweet tale of friendship and innocent love. I do not know what the intention of Katherine Paterson was since I have not read her book; however, the situation disclosed in the film by the director Gabor Csupo with the tragic fate of Leslie is absolutely unnecessary. Therefore I believe the director and screenplay writers failed, showing only a heartbreaking and touching situation that could be avoided. I was impressed with the charm, beauty and talent of AnnaSophia Robb in the role of Leslie Burke, and I loved her character; and I never forget Josh Hutcherson, the Gabe of the delightful and sweet first love story ""Little Manhattan"". But ""Bridge to Terabithia"" is very disappointing and overrated. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""Ponte para Terabithia"" (""Bridge to Terabithia"")",Bridge to Terabithia
6,jboothmillard,Bridge to Terabithia,8,23 December 2009,"From the trailer I saw, I thought this was going to be some sort of Chronicles of Narnia rip-off, but it was actually surprisingly good. Basically ten-year-old Jesse 'Jess' Aarons (Josh Hutcherson) lives with his poor family, father Jack (Robert Patrick), mother Mary (Kate Butler), and four annoying sisters, in a farm house. He has a love for drawing, is bullied at school and has hardly any friends, and then he meets the new ten-year-old girl student who beats him in a race. Jess and Leslie Burke (Charlie and the Chocolate Factory's AnnaSophia Robb) have a rocky start, but she doesn't let bullies bother her, and being neighbours, they become very close friends. One day they find a rope swing across a near dried out river, and swinging to the other side, Leslie starts claiming they are in a magical land with many mythical creatures living in it. Jess eventually gets into this imagined world also, and they name it Terabithia, to have some amazing adventures with monsters, trolls, ogres, and giants, with him and Leslie as the king and queen. Their friendship also leads them to give the bullies a taste of their own medicine, and Jess's love of drawing is an interest to his attractive teacher Ms. Edmunds (Yes Man's Zooey Deschanel), who one day invites him to an art gallery. When tragedy occurs, Leslie dying when the rope swing snaps, Jess blames himself for her death, and only has his parents and younger sister May Belle Aarons (Bailee Madison) to comfort him. In the end though, he misses Terabithia, and decides to make a magical bridge, to return to the land he rules, with May Belle as his princess to join in the imagination. Also starring Devon Wood as Brenda Aarons, Emma Fenton as Ellie Aarons, Grace Brannigan as Joyce Aarons and Latham Gaines as Bill Burke. Hutcherson and Robb are wonderful as the leading child stars, and the special effects are marvellous to take you into the realm of imagination, a great family fantasy adventure. Very good!",Bridge to Terabithia
7,Tweekums,A delightful tragedy,9,29 December 2009,"Unfortunately I'd already heard about ""the tragic event"" before watching this film so it may have lost a little of its impact however I still really enjoyed it. I didn't realise at the time that it was made by Disney but I'm not surprised as it reminded me of the live action Disney films I watched as a child back in the '70s... although the special effects were obviously better.Set in a small town in rural America Jess is a bit of an outsider at school and this isn't helped when his trainers fall apart and he is given a hand-me-down pair of pink trainers that belonged to his older sister. On the first day of the new school year a new student joins his class and beats him and the other boys in the class in a race... this new student is Leslie, the girl who has just moved into the house next to Jess. Rather than resenting her they become close friends and start to play in a woods near their homes which they access via a rope swing over a stream. Once over the stream Leslie leads Jess in a fantasy, imagining it isn't just a woods but the Kingdom of Terabithia which is inhabited by strange creatures such as trolls.Their friendship develops as they play in they imaginary kingdom and also confront the bullies at school, things come to an abrupt end though when Jess goes to an art gallery with his teacher one Saturday and returns home to learn that Leslie has died after falling in to the stream which was swollen due to recent rain. Jess initially can't believe that she is dead and when he does accept it he blames himself thinking that she would still be alive if he'd stayed home and played with her or asked if she could go with him to the museum. When his sister tries to follow him across the stream he initially prevents her wanting to keep Terabithia his special place where he searches in vain for Leslie. Eventually as he come to terms with his loss he builds a bridge over the stream so he can take his little sister over in safety.I was really charmed by this film, Josh Hutcherson did a good job as Jess and AnnaSophia Robb really shone as Leslie, I suspect these two young actors will be in plenty of other good films if they choose to stick with acting. The adult actors were also pretty good, noticeably Zooey Deschanel as the music teacher who sees Jess's artistic talent and invites him to the gallery and Robert Patrick who played Jess's no nonsense father. Some parents might want to watch this film before showing it to younger or more sensitive children as they may be troubled by Leslie's death although it is sensitively dealt with.",Bridge to Terabithia
8,tavm,Bridge to Terabithia is a wonderfully essential family film,10,17 March 2007,"Based on the Newberry Award-winning book, Bridge to Terabithia is the story of two tween outcasts, Jesse and Leslie, who bond over their creative endeavors, drawing and writing, respectively. After school, they swing a rope across the brook and go to their tree clubhouse where they imagine being in the land of Terabithia, fighting various creatures and racing each other. Josh Hutcherson and AnnaSophia Robb are wonderful as the lead characters. Among the adults, I especially liked Zooey Deschanel as the music teacher and Robert Patrick as Jesse's dad. Despite some sadness along the way, this is essential viewing for the whole family. Kudos to Gabor Csupo and the Disney Company for making it.",Bridge to Terabithia
9,dbborroughs,Even though it didn't ring any bells for me I know its a good film,7,23 December 2007,"Outsider boy meets outsider girl and their vivid imaginations form a bond. Very good family film was completely lost on me. Never having read the book nor seeing the earlier film version I was coming into this for the first time. I thought it was a reasonably good portrait of the life of a kid. It just didn't click with me. (SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER Apropos of nothing I do question the tragic turn in the last third. I know that in the book but for me its part of a long line of classics that turn deadly in the final moments, mostly with turns out of left field. For me its always seemed that the bad things-often off screen happen simply to add weight to the stories being told. But thats my own problem.END SPOILER) Recommended, because despite it being lost on me I know its a good movie.",Bridge to Terabithia
10,lastliberal,Just close your eyes and keep your mind wide open.,8,1 January 2008,"I have been anticipating this film for some time and was glad that I finally got a chance to see it. It exceeded my expectations and I have to rank it as the most enjoyable children's film I have ever seen.First, I am in love with Leslie (AnnaSophia Robb). Yes, I know she is only 14. I want to adopt he - nothing more. I want that smile and attitude around me forever. Of course, it was the love shown by her parents that really made her what she was. How many parents spend time dancing with their children? Maybe we could create some more Leslies.Of course, Jesse (Josh Hutcherson) was crucial to the film. As the boy transformed by Leslie and, to a lesser extent by Ms. Edmonds (the very lovely Zooey Deschanel), he really showed a range of emotions as he was opened up and matured.This is a film that no one should miss.",Bridge to Terabithia
11,grantss,Sweet movie,6,9 May 2015,"Sweet movie for kids.A movie clearly made for children: main characters are all children, simplistic plot, fantasy sequences, not overly profound and what moral there was to the story was fairly unoriginal.This said, kids should love it.Also, it's not all a waste of time from an adult perspective: it's hardly dull, doesn't overstay its welcome, is reasonably entertaining...and the cast includes Zooey Deschanel.Decent performances from Josh Hutcherson and AnnaSophia Robb in the lead roles.",Bridge to Terabithia
12,neil-476,Wonderful,9,12 August 2008,"Add me to the list of those who picked up on this movie because of the misleading promotion.And that's not the only hole-picking I have on my mind.Next door neighbours - rich family and dirt-poor family? That's an unusual road.The songs in the music class - hardly singalong material.OK, that's it.Other than that, I found myself absolutely delighted in being misled into seeing this beautiful, moving little movie, and I can't praise the performances highly enough. The juvenile leads are all excellent, but I would single out Jen Wolfe for the small part of Ms Myers, the hard-nosed teacher who shows another side of herself in reaction to Jess' uncharacteristically aggressive outburst.This is a fine film.",Bridge to Terabithia
13,anaconda-40658,The Bridge Falls.,5,12 May 2015,"Bridge to Terabithia (2007): Dir: Gabor Csupo / Cast: Josh Hutcherson, Annasophia Robb, Robert Patrick, Zooey Deschanel, Bailee Madison: Heart tugging family fantasy referencing Heaven. Terabithia is a place that comes to life in the forest within the imaginations of two middle school friends played by Josh Hutcherson and Annasophia Robb. Directed by Gabor Csupo with an eye for detail as trees come to life and creatures are in pursuit. Although aimed at families, it reckons caution for young children due too scary sequences and themes regarding death. Formula structure teaching a powerful lesson about friendship yet seems to anxious to go for the tear jerker response. Hutcherson learns the biggest lesson as he escapes into a world shared with the smart and witty Robb. Robert Patrick is the stereotypical father who spends much of the film calling down his son and not realizing his son's talent. His turnabout in the end seems more plot convenient than genuine. Zooey Deschanel is wasted as a beautiful music teacher who takes interest in Hutcherson and invites him on an outing that he will soon regret. Bailee Madison plays Hutcherson's younger sister. There is definitely room for discussion for families while the film is somewhat depressing in the My Girl variety. We are asked to rethink our options and build on friendships as oppose to tearing down the bridge with regret. Score: 5 / 10",Bridge to Terabithia
14,zetes,"A little thin, but good for children",7,19 March 2007,"*THIS COMMENT DEFINITELY CONTAINS SPOILERS*I read the book by Katherine Patterson way back in grade school. I remembered nothing about it but that the little girl died. It's a charming little story about imagination and friendship, and for kids it's mostly excellent just because it's so easy to recognize one's own life. But, yeah, it's memorable because it was the first book I ever read where one of the main characters died unexpectedly. And even if it's sad for kids, it's important to know about death. The film itself is decent, if unremarkable (in all honesty, the book is probably not as good as it seemed when I was 10). It has fantasy elements, but they are so (thankfully) sparse that they feel like they were invented just to put them in the commercials. They aren't (very) annoying when they're there. I'll bet that, for the same reasons that I remember it, it will become a beloved classic among the current crop of kids.",Bridge to Terabithia
15,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Bridge to Terabithia,10,19 May 2007,"Based on a children's fantasy story written by Katherine Paterson, and produced by the same company that did the latest Chronicles of Narnia, I thought that the movie would probably be mediocre given my lukewarm response to films of similar genre like Pan's Labyrinth and The Last Mimzy. And how wrong was I. Bridges of Tarabithia trumps over all the movies mentioned, basically because it had a good story to tell, and stuck to telling that story instead of being distracted by the bells and whistles of special effects.It tells the story of a budding friendship struck between two kids, both lonely souls who found each other by virtue of being in the same class, and neighbours. Jesse Aarons (Josh Hutcherson, last seen in RV) is the lone boy in a family of girls, and finds that his simply living in a world of his own, getting no attention from his parents or siblings. He finds solace in his drawings, while being target practice for the bullies in school. Newcomer to the neighbourhood Leslie Burke (AnnaSophia Robb, last seen in The Reaping) shares the same loneliness, being new to town, and neglected by her parents when they go into their creative writing zone.Tarabithia becomes the fantasy world the friends find themselves in, a forested area off their residence. There, they become who they want to be, and through their imaginative world, become fast playmates, and firm friends. And with new found confidence and strength, they become more nimble in navigating through the school's playground politics. Needless to say, despite their age, you'll be wondering if like Mukhsin, the friendship between the two will develop into something deeper, with all the feel good moments around.What I liked about it is its positivity in the themes explored, despite a dark moment. It's about hope, love, the power of imagination when you open your mind and make believe. It has adult themes, and somewhat gives a feel like Pan's Labyrinth, minus the dark moody overtones. I can't help but guffaw at the discussion of religion too. For the most parts it has a breezy pace, until it sledgehammers certain emotions that will definitely bring on a tear or two from those who are soft hearted.The leads too do a commendable job, and their chemistry just perfect. They fed off each other's enthusiasm well, and made Terabithia believable. The special effects didn't go over the top, or turned on unnecessarily, as they are quite small scale compared to the arsenal employed for other fantasy movies, therefore not stealing the thunder, or distract the audience from the story. Reigned in properly, the effects are just effects, and not the main deal.The last act indeed takes the cake, and you'll more often than not feel for the characters, and wonder about selfishness. Unless you don't have a heart, you'll definitely feel sorry, and understand the blame inflicted. With supporting casts like Robert Patrick and Zooey Deschanel (Hitchhiker's Guide to the Universe) who also lent her voice as the singing schoolteacher, don't miss Bridge to Terabithia! Oh, and bring a date along too!",Bridge to Terabithia
16,siderite,"Actually, it was pretty good!",8,31 August 2007,"I started watching this film thinking is a poor man's version of Narnia or something like that. Nothing could be farther from the truth. This is one of those childhood stories, as seen through child eyes, that describe a very meaningful emotional experience of the author. In other words, the stuff that you want to get it right when you write it.Bottom line: it is a very nice film, one that reminds one of childhood and that inspires the watcher to keep an open mind and bring joy to the world. There is also a very emotional moment at the end, so be prepared, this is not a movie for children as much as a movie from the inner child of adults.",Bridge to Terabithia
17,JamesHitchcock,Sombre and Depressing,5,24 May 2007,"Like a number of other viewers, I had got the impression from the rather misleading publicity material that this film was a fantasy along the lines of ""The Chronicles of Narnia"", a film which I rather enjoyed even though I am not a follower of C. S. Lewis's brand of evangelical fundamentalism. Of course, ""Bridge to Terabithia"" is not a fantasy of that nature, but it does have some similarities to ""The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"". (Even the name ""Terabithia"" was derived by Katherine Patterson, author of the original novel, from ""Terebinthia"", an island in Lewis's Narnia books). Both concern children who find their way into a magical kingdom, populated by all sorts of strange and magical creatures, some good, some evil. In ""The Lion.."" the entrance to the alternative universe is through the back of a wardrobe; in ""Terabithia"" it can be reached by swinging on a rope across a stream. The difference is that in Lewis's books we are supposed to accept that the Pevensie children actually do enter the land of Narnia, whereas the kingdom of Terabithia has no existence outside the children's imagination.The main characters are a boy called Jess and a girl called Leslie. (To British eyes that looks the wrong way round. Over here Leslie is normally a boy's name, the equivalent girl's name being spelled ""Lesley"", and Jess is most commonly a diminutive of Jessica). Both are outsiders and the victims of the bullies at their school, of which there are a surprising number. Rudeness, sarcasm and snobbery seem to be core subjects on the American school curriculum. Jess is bullied because of his family's poverty (his father is a struggling farmer) and his imaginative, sensitive nature. It seems strange that the attractive, outgoing Leslie should be unpopular, but she is taunted because she is a new girl in the school and because her parents are seen as eccentric. (They do not, for example, own a television). Although Jess and Leslie are in their early teens, rather younger than the age at which most children start to take a romantic interest in the opposite sex, they become best friends, relying on one another for mutual support against the bullies. The Kingdom of Terabithia, in which they fight battles against the Dark Master on behalf of the oppressed inhabitants, is their fantasy world into which they can escape. Jess also sees it as a way of escaping from his troubled home life and his parents, especially his father, a strict disciplinarian who has little sympathy with Jess's imaginative flights of fancy.For much of its length, the film is a fairly normal coming-of-age story, but abruptly changes tone about two-thirds of the way through when Leslie, attempting to cross the stream without Jess, falls into the water and drowns. To kill off a major character as sweet and lovable as young Leslie is always a risk for any film to take, and ""Bridge to Terabithia"" never recovers from this point on, especially as young Anna Sophia Robb, who plays Leslie, is one of the few actors to show any life or animation. (The others are Zooey Deschanel, who plays the inspirational music teacher Ms Edmonds and Bailee Madison who plays Jess's little sister May Belle). Josh Hutcherson, who plays Jess, rather overdoes the moody, misunderstood teenager thing, and apart from Deschanel the adults all seem a pretty gloomy bunch.Like the previous reviewer I suspect that this film will do better in America than Britain, although for different reasons to the ones he gives. (Patterson's book, after all, is frequently referred to as a ""beloved American classic"", whereas nobody in Britain seems to have read it or even to have heard of it before the film came out). He finds the film too religious for British tastes, but I actually found its attitude to religion ambivalent (although Patterson herself claims to be a Christian writer). A key scene comes when Jess and Leslie go to church together. Leslie, whose family are non-religious and has never been to church before, is inspired and uplifted by the Christian message, which she finds beautiful, whereas Jess regards Christianity as boring and churchgoing as an unwelcome duty imposed upon him by his devoutly religious parents.I know that this is supposed to be a deeply meaningful film with an uplifting message about facing up to loss and bereavement and the power of the imagination to overcome unhappiness, a film in which even the unsympathetic characters such as Jess's father, a stern teacher and even one of the bullies eventually reveal their human side, but I found it sombre and depressing, too unsure of its convictions to provide any spiritual uplift. Even the special effects used to create the imaginary creatures of Terabithia were below par by the standards of modern blockbusters. 5/10",Bridge to Terabithia
18,DKosty123,Three Hankies For a Warm Touchy Film,7,24 May 2007,"This film for it's first 2/3 is about having an open mind & escapism. It does a fine job of portraying both. All the actors & actresses portraying the main characters do a fine job. It does fit the Disney Family film production mold which has been a well established one for decades since Walt was alive.This is a two family story about 2 kids, a boy & a girl who have trouble fitting in at school. He (Jesse) is in secret an artist though he does so much drawing that soon the secret is getting out. She (Leslie) is a young girl all about having an imagination full of trolls etc. When she moves to his school, & next door to his house, they form a special relationship as they naturally gravitate towards one another. Jesse & Leslie create a special place (kingdom) all their own.Then, when everything is happy in this story, the rug gets pulled out when Leslie tragically dies. Jesse tries to block out that reality with his imagination & keeps finding that doesn't work. He goes back to their special place expecting he will still find Leslie there. When he finally faces reality that she is not, he builds a new bridge to that special place & then makes a special invite for his younger sister to come there with him.The only weakness in this is that there really isn't a scene where Jesse truly reacts to the reality Leslie is gone. It is sort of addressed but not fully dealt with. Josh Hutchinson & AnnaSophia Robb do a fine job in the leads. They get plenty of support from the rest of the cast. I can only rate this a 7 though because even though the film paints a fine portrait, Jesse dealing with Leslie death somehow seems left incomplete in my viewing. While the bridge he builds symbolizes it, his reaching that bridge to build needs a little more development.",Bridge to Terabithia
19,disdressed12,less of the fantasy element than i'd hoped for(and not a movie for young kids),5,24 November 2007,"i was disappointed in this movie.it thought there would be more of a fantasy element to it,but that was just a very small part of the movie.most of the movie was nothing spectacular,with very little story or character development.i just felt they could have done more with the material.that's not to say that it's bad movie,because it isn't.the movie takes a dark turn towards the latter half,and becomes heartbreaking.i don't think it would be suitable for really young kids,because there are some pretty serious themes to it,and because it takes such a dark turn.there's nothing really offensive though,but parents should really use their discretion.for me,i give Bridge to Terabithia a 5/10",Bridge to Terabithia
20,OllieSuave-007,Touching movie that spawns your imagination.,8,2 February 2014,"This is a nice movie about preteen outsider Jesse Aarons who befriends newcomer Leslie Burke at school. Together, they form an unlikely friendship and, using their minds and imagination, create Terabithia, a land full of trolls, ogres and giants. The visual effects of the make-believe land are actually very good, vibrant and full of color, and they give you a sense that you are actually there from the mind's perspective. While many movies' stories take place in fictional lands such as Oz, Neverland and Hogsworth, it is refreshing to see a story that takes place in a magical land, but only in the minds of two kids, reminding the audience that the movie actually takes place in the ""real"" world. It gives the perspective of how one's imagination can lead to the befriending of two mismatched people like Jesse and Leslie and how it improves one's life. This movie reminds children how complicated life can be and how letting your imagination guide you can go a long way. With good acting and an overall touching and hopeful story (with only a few scenes that I thought dragged the plot) this movie is a good one for the whole family.Grade B+",Bridge to Terabithia
21,Buddy-51,"charming, low-keyed fantasy",7,19 August 2007,"""Bridge to Terabithia"" is that rare movie about enchantment that is actually enchanting. Based on the novel by Katherine Paterson, this is like a more kid-friendly version of ""Pan's Labyrinth,"" in that both films deal with unhappy children who retreat into a fully realized world of fantasy - the difference being that, in this case at least, it is a world seemingly of their own making.Jesse Aarons, a local farm boy, is a regular target of bullies at school, while Leslie Burke is the new kid in town, never an easy thing to be when you're an underclassman in a school full of obnoxious, belligerent eighth graders who don't mind showing you who's boss every time you walk down the hallway or dare to use the lavatory. The two new friends obviously need a place to get away from their troubles, so in the forest nearby, they create the imaginary kingdom of Terabithia, filled with wondrous creatures and non-threatening ogres, that becomes increasingly actualized as the story goes on.""Bridge to Terabithia"" succeeds by keeping it uncluttered and simple and by focusing more on the daily lives of Jesse and Leslie than on their adventures in the forest. Fantasy, the film seems to be saying, is for those special times when reality gets to be just a bit too much to handle, but that the real, everyday world is the place we all must inhabit for most of our time here on earth. The movie is all in favor of childhood imagination, but not at the expense of real world experiences and relationships.The tricky premise is brought to charming cinematic life by writers Jeff Stockwell and David Paterson, director Gabor Csupo, and the special effects experts who understand that less is often more when it comes to making the fantastical real and believable on screen. But primary credit goes to the utterly winning performances by Josh Hutcherson, Anna Sophia Robb, and six-year old Bailee Madison, who, as Jesse's adorable kid sister, reminds one of Drew Barrymore in her early ""E.T."" days. All three do a lovely job embodying the youthful exuberance and openhearted wonder that are so much a part of the movie's vision and theme.Parents should note that, while the movie may be too emotionally wrenching for very young children (there's an unusually stark plot development towards the end of the film), it is ideal viewing for slightly older kids and younger teens. It's great fun, too, for adults not too cynical and jaded to tap into the dream.",Bridge to Terabithia
22,cherold,the ending just ruined it for me,6,13 August 2018,"I avoided Bridge to Terabithia because I heard there was some tragedy in it and who needs tragedy in their children's fantasy movies. But for some reason I recently took a look, and I wish I'd stuck with my original course of action.There is much to like in this movie. AnnaSophia Robb is excellent as one of those impossibly wonderful people who, as in this film, appear as angels to help out sullen brooders like Jess (Josh Hutcherson). The fantasy sequences are excellent, particularly an extended sequence in the middle. The movie does a good job of portraying how children can create their own world and play off each other like an improv troupe.There are also things to not like. The movie several times descends into musical-montage territory to ill effect, and Hutcherson's glumness is wearying (although no inaccurate; I myself was a glum and probably unlikable child).But the big problem is that at a certain point the movie goes from a whimsical tale about the power of imagination to being a really upsetting bummer. And while I understand the genesis of the story (from wikipedia) and can see its value, I just don't want this experience. If there were exchange departments for experiences I would go back and get something different.The movie's attempt to end on an uplifting note simply fell flat for me. But if you don't mind bummer twists, go ahead and watch this.",Bridge to Terabithia
23,Robert_duder,Cute. But where was Terabithia?,7,7 August 2007,"Prior to this film being released I had never heard of Bridge to Terabithia, never read the book, never seen the book, literally no inside knowledge but it looked interesting enough and I love Disney films as well as Walden Media's previous film The Chronicles of Narnia and this looked like another brilliant and beautiful fantasy tale. Bridge to Terabithia is good, great for kids with plenty of action and a good story although very sad but with some important lessons and that's where it climaxes. Bridge to Terabithia is one enormous moral life lesson and there is nothing wrong with that but I wasn't expecting it AT ALL!! I expected these kids to create this world and be completely engulfed in it rather than simply imagining and creating small moments in this world and then returning to live in the real world of mean people, crushes, growing up, money, working, family and everything else you can possibly imagine. It's probably almost a little too grown up for really young kids and the fantasy aspect of the film is very light. There are no truly magnificent creatures you come to know but rather the two lead children who are terrific. It's just not right to let anyone walk into this film thinking Lord of The Rings, Chronicles of Narnia, or Harry Potter because their world is far more harsh than that and real!! TOO REAL! Josh Hutcherson, who is no stranger to acting already, starring in 15 plus films plays quiet and artistic Jesse Aarons who usually finds himself the butt of jokes by the loud and obnoxious fellow students at his public school. Hutcherson is terrific and such an amazing lead actor in this film. I think kids will love watching him and really relate to his situation and really respect him and follow him. I hope he continued to get some really great roles. Also really terrific is AnnaSophia Robb who plays unique dreamer Leslie Burke who befriends Jesse and together they have incredible adventures together and form a lasting friendship. AnnaSophia is such a sweetheart and really does bring Leslie to life as this carefree, deep thinking, happy, spirited little girl. She really is the perfect Disney girl and probably has a promising career as such ahead of her. Also terrific is 8 year old Bailee Madison who plays the irrepressible and adorable May Belle Aarons who is really heading towards the same fate that Jesse finds himself in, in the real world. Jesse takes her under his wing and shows her the magic world that him and Leslie have created. Robert Patrick is also just terrific as the Aarons' father, Jesse Sr. Patrick's character is not a bad guy at all!! In fact he is desperately trying to provide for his family, and has simply been worn by the world around him. He wants his children to be raised to be strong providers especially his only son. The supporting cast is also terrific with key performances by Zooey Deschanel, Lauren Clinton, and Cameron Wakefield.The story is not about Terabithia, even remotely. Instead the story is a coming of age story about a boy who learns to deal with the harsh realities of the real world while still finding time to dream and imagine, fall in love for the first time, and find happiness with a true friend. It's a very cute story and you could and should definitely watch it with pre-teens with some guidance because there is definitely some heavy story moments that are a bit intense and almost over whelming but the film packs a good punch for a Disney film and doesn't apologize for it. Very new to directing, but no stranger to producing kid's films and cartoons is Gabor Csupo. He knows how to tell a story and can turn the gray and cold real world into this magic world and forest and beauty. There is one particular brilliant creature to check out that is never really given a name but it's very cool. This is Bridge to Terabithia which in no way is disappointing, just simply very different than I could have ever imagine it was. Adults might find it a little tedious but you know perhaps there is a little moral message here for everyone especially adults that have forgotten how to imagine. 7.5/10",Bridge to Terabithia
24,MLDinTN,"fun to watch, sad to watch",5,8 January 2008,"I thought this movie was OK. It was fun and entertaining, but also sad. Jesse is an outsider at school. The new girl, Leslie, who lives across the street, becomes his friend. They live by these woods and find a rope that swings across a creek. Once crossing the creek, they find an old tree house and begin to use their imagination to entertain themselves. They create the world of Terabithia and all its inhabitants. Squirels are really creatures throwing grenades(pine cones) at them. They encounter ""tree trolls"" and dragonflys that are soldiers. It's just a fun game to them.One day, Jesse is invited to the museum and he doesn't invite Leslie. When he gets home, he learns Leslie drowned in the creek. He must deal with his guilt and take the lessons he learned from Leslie with him.I thought the death of Leslie was tragic. It brought a tear.

One day, Leslie creates a fantasy world with mystical creatures and an evil being called the Dark Master. The acting, especially by the kids were excellent. The screenplay worked well and I believe that it's better than the book, according to people I know. The plot was the best and it tells a powerful message.

26,Irishchatter,Very sad and good movie!,8,10 April 2016,"I remember reading the book on my last year of primary school and lemme tell ya, it was seriously sad for a 12 year old haha ! I actually forgot all about it, until I've seen the movie airing on Channel 4 today. It really brought memories because actually, my classmates and myself on our school tour in 2007 had a choice to watch either ""Pirates of the Caribbean:At World's End"" or this. No doubt since I am a fan of the Pirates of the Caribbean so I went to see that instead! Anyways let's talk about the film, wow I didn't realise young Josh Hutcherson was on this! May, he looked so young and is different now as a grown up! Himself and AnnaSophia Robb looked so cute together! Their relationship really blossomed as the film went on and that's what I liked about the story because it reflects friendship no matter what age, religion, circumstances, gender you are! I was very saddened that Leslie died because it brought a flashback to me when I read the book in class and heard she got drowned! Very sad!This is the best movie adaption although like any movie taken from novels, it wouldn't be the same as the book. Sure, it's good enough because they did a good job in making this movie happen!",Bridge to Terabithia
27,tabuno,A Touching Adolescent Drama,8,21 January 2019,"7 July 2007. Unfortunately, the trailers and previews of this movie are quite misleading regarding this adaptation of the book to screen version that focuses more on the more popular fantasy connection than to the world of the human imagination connection in this strictly human drama that looks at two student outcasts and their relationship together. The script feels authentic, the situations and dialogue feel familiar from real life. The movie is held together by the strength of its freshness and originality from the book author's ability to tell a story from the heart and capture the school experience and the merging of two people from different backgrounds and families. It's difficult to evaluate this movie from what this movie and likely book leaves out of the typical adolescent movie and the plot unfolds unlike most other movies. The small snippets of scenes at times seem too abbreviating and not fully developed, the leading character's talents are not brought out and fleshed out. However, by dealing with some important universal themes, this movie is an important contribution and recommended movie for all adolescents. Eight out of Ten Stars.",Bridge to Terabithia

The film is essentially nothing more than a child's fantasy that never got real, but is so incredibly well done. It is an effective visualization of kids fantasies. It also sends out a very strong message about bullying, and dealing with being an 'outsider'.The visual effects are incredible, and the acting is convincing. The child stars are fantastic. The film has a twist towards the end that I never saw coming, which made the film that much more special.",Bridge to Terabithia
30,briancham1994,Heartwarming and heartbreaking,8,6 August 2020,This film has the full gamut of emotion. It features an underdog children's story that feels like a typical feel-good film but it goes into completely new directions. It beautifully portrays the experience of growing up as a child with imaginative worlds and troubles at school. The trailers were misleading as the imaginative world is only a small part of this film. Overall it is really about human experiences and connections.,Bridge to Terabithia
31,johnnyboyz,It certainly achieves what it sets out to do in regards to its target audience but whether others will see it in an equally enjoyable light is questionable.,6,9 December 2008,"I guess Bridge to Terabithia works on the level it does because of that nasty plot twist much later on in the piece. The revelation is actually quite welcome when you think or assume how ordinary the film might've been had it not happened and the film descended into a monotony of pleasant endings after all the other pleasantries that had followed up until that point. So on one hand, credit to the picture for not bailing out and following for through with a brave finale although on the other hand, Bridge to Terabithia is nothing spectacular but does offer a specifically young demographic the chance to watch something marginally complicated but thoroughly engaging; at least for that audience.Bridge to Terabithia is a sort of Pan's Labyrinth for a younger audience. Like the Mexican best picture in a foreign language nominee, it establishes a 'real' world in which times of desperation are very much present and it places a young, perhaps troubled because of the desperate events going on around them, hero on a farm thus allowing feelings and situations to brew. For the film's hero Jess Aarons (Hutcherson), the Spanish Civil War does not offer any particular threat but a financial crunch does. All around him there is misery and potential upset. His father Jack (Patrick) comes across as the sort of individual who could blow at any minute but retains a relatively nice, fatherly, understanding persona overall  this is Robert Patrick doing what he did in recent efforts Walk the Line and Ladder 49 to the best of his ability.But Bridge to Terabithia takes this young hero and enables them to escape to an alternate, imaginary universe only this time with a playmate to accompany them. She is the new neighbour called Leslie Burke (Robb) and like Jess, she is suffering at school with all those issues that mar school life. So like Pan's Labyrinth, these young and quite naïve heroes are presented with lonely and somewhat poor rural lives at home but unlike Pan's Labyrinth, the issues branch out into school complete with bullying and the inability to fit in with a crowd.The two escape to Terabithia, a world on the other side of a small creek in the surrounding woods adjacent their homes and it is here in which they find their solace; their fake utopian world away from their real dystopian one. While this is great for younger viewers, encouraging fantastical play and showing real children on screen doing things the target audience may also do; I just didn't get the connection myself. In filmic terms, it doesn't work dramatically for anyone over a certain age. The characters that inhabit the school are clichés: you have the bully; the victim; the potential love interest and that young, polite, female music teacher who's the one teacher the kids can connect with. They're archetypes that we're familiar with and don't work beyond what they set out to do and that is to act as visual indicators to the demographic what 'type' of characters are on screen.The film is really all about standing up to ones adversaries; it's about defeating ones doubts in harsh times. The film makes this apparent through whatever mini narratives the two kids set up once in Terabithia and those are to do with coming up against overwhelming odds such as trolls and multiple flying/ground monsters and winning through in the end. The film is also littered with quotes and quips to do with pulling through, the most obvious of which herald from wartime president Franklin Roosevelt to do with achieving when you put your mind to it and the film's favourite: ""Keep your eyes closed, but your mind wide open"". There's also no coincidence the birds in Terabithia make the same 'Dead Meat!' crow the bullies make at school; clearly distinguishing what the birds are meant to be in the fantasy and that if defeating them in another form is possible then you can attempt to do so in the real world.But again, for the target demographic: perfect. These ideas are great when aiming the film at the specific audience and it doesn't chicken out towards the end either, maintaining that loss is a part of life after all. Part of watching a film is that means of escapism  escapism into another world or time or country in which the film is made, but is it any fun when we have to pretend even further? Bridge to Terabithia is grounded in a present day Western civilisation but in order to get something different we have to propel ourselves further into the fantasy of two young characters who are making it all up as they go along. Again, this makes things fail dramatically to an adult audience and the adventures they have in the forest act as a mere visual clue as to what the beasts 'might' be once translated into the real world.It's by no means a bad film, in fact for the target audience it's pretty spectacular. I don't know how faithful it is to the 1977 book but in terms of relation to Pan's Labyrinth it's almost a carbon copy in terms of ideas right down to the final shot hinting at some sort of new order. But that would spoil both films, something I really don't want to do. I think the perfect viewing circumstances might well be parents watching the film with their children and pointing out all the good stuff as they go along, that way the children will get verbal confirmation from the ones they love and trust most as well as a satisfying film-viewing experience.",Bridge to Terabithia
32,filipemanuelneto,The beauty of simple things.,9,3 November 2017,"When I found this movie, I thought it would just be another Disney animation in a magical land, with fairies, goblins and other creatures. It's much better. The whole story is based on the friendship of two preteens, a boy and a girl, who feel united by fantasy and imagination, tools that they learn to use to overcome and overcome the difficulties of everyday life. It's a film loaded with sensitivity and feelings, which focuses on the strength of creativity and friendship.Josh Hutcherson ""was born"" on TV but this film, along with ""Polar Express"", allowed him to jump to the movies and mature years later in ""Hunger Games"". He is a good actor, although still very young, and it shone in this film next to AnnaSophia Robb, equally competent in a character who is present even when it is absent. Being a teen movie, it is natural for adults to be in the shade. So I was very surprised to see Zooey Deschanel in the role of a mere music teacher, whose most notable sequence was a visit to a museum. Robert Patrick (T-1000 of ""Terminator 2"") was also very good in the role of a rough father, with his feet firmly on the ground, expecting from his son a maturity that he's not yet prepared to have. On a technical level, it's an elegant movie that looks simpler than it is. Good but discrete cinematography and high-quality CGI, focused on very specific points in the film, help to reinforce this sense of apparent simplicity. It's the beauty of simple things that stand out. And friendship among young people is so simple, isn't it?",Bridge to Terabithia

Paterson adapted the story with Jeff Stockwell.The story got started when David's best friend, an eight-year old Lisa Hill, got struck by lightning at a beach and died in 1974.Katherine used this tragic event as an inspiration to her novel.Josh Hutcherson and AnnaSophia Robb work so great together in the lead.These kids may be going places.Another great, but small kid star is Bailee Madison as May Belle Aarons.Robert Patrick is brilliant playing Jesse's distant father Jack.Kate Butler is terrific as his mother Mary.Zooey Deschanel is magnificent as Ms. Edmunds.Leslie's parents Bill and Judy Burke are played by Latham Gaines and Judy MacIntosh.Lauren Clinton plays the bully Janice Avery, who becomes soft and nice person.Bullies Scott Hoager and Gary Fulcher are played by Cameron Wakefield and Elliot Lawless.Bridge to Terabithia is a movie for the whole family.It works on so many levels.It's a dramatic adventure fantasy giving something for everyone.And it can be funny from time to time.Jess and Leslie are characters so many of us can relate to, both kids and adults who have been teased.You feel good for this boy when he finally finds a friend.And it's so much fun watching them play together in the woods.I was deeply touched in the end, when Jess comes back from the museum and finds his parents being worried sick.They think he has also died, just like his best friend Leslie.Jess doesn't want to believe she has died and he goes into the woods looking for Leslie.But Leslie is gone, and nothing could bring her back.This movie deals with friendship and loss in a wonderful way.The movie made me miss being a child, all the great adventures in a forest.I never had my Terabithia with anybody, but everything was much neater as a child.Why can't childhood go on forever?",Bridge to Terabithia
34,leplatypus,At last ! the search is over (dad),10,8 May 2017,"Watching recent American movies, i was getting tired of those prestigious families, full of money and careers, of this stifling violence against enemies, of this outrageous promiscuity and endless nudity So up to now, if the adult content was however cut from, families movies were pretty indigestible (Narnias, Spiderwick, ) faraway of the excellent Labyrinth, Goonies from the 80s ! This one caught me right from the start : it's about a young boy in rural America who is alone, feeling cut from his poor family (at least, a movie about one with an admirable Patrick as always) and school fellows. He takes refuge in his artistic hobby and has a crush on his musical teacher. As she is played by Deschanel, i can understand him but beyond, this is very similar to my own life Then he befriends her new neighbor friend (not Mary Jane but the excellent girl who played with Hillary in a supernatural thriller in the bayou) and thanks to her and her wide, limitless imagination and acceptance, he is open to life again ! He feels better with himself, his family and his friend ! I just love the way their friendship is built, stone after stone, how they face together to the bad things of their real life and how they use theirs to imagine a better world ! For one time, it feels real, there is no violence, there is not an enemy to kill taking a gun. The two acting kids are marvelous as much the mute boy than the always happy girl ! And then, every thing will change after he makes maybe a selfish choice So it's a bit again Peter Parker and his great responsibility but also the same pain of the very moving novel (and also movie) Walk to remember This is as sudden, unexpected, and senseless as the real life and what happens is really done with tact, emotion, compassion The only regret i could say is that for me, the link between reality – fantasy seems to not have been used to its maximum potential ! So it's a wonderful movie for kids and adult as well with values and tools very useful to live I thought i concluded with a personal remembrance but i noticed that i have already done it when reviewing french Facts of life, a title that that would be also very accurate for this beautiful movie !",Bridge to Terabithia
35,howard.schumann,Never feels authentic,7,10 November 2007,"Katherine Paterson's novel ""Bridge to Terabithia"" is the moving story of two lonely children who rely on each other's strength to overcome their own shortcomings. It is a highly symbolic and multi-layered coming of age story that deals with family, friendship, imagination, and death. Sadly in the Walden Media/Disney version of Bridge to Terabithia, the combination of phony uplifting messages, wooden performances, and unimpressive special effects contribute to a film experience that offers little joy or believability, even for the 8 to 12 year old age group it is geared for. While it is decent family entertainment and its theme about the power of imagination is most welcome, the fact that so many people call this film a masterpiece only indicates to me the extent that we have lost the ability in our society to distinguish between art and kitsch.For those unfamiliar with Walden Media, it is a film production and publishing company owned by Philip Anschutz, a billionaire oil tycoon, recently identified by Beliefnet as the tenth most powerful Christian in Hollywood. Walden's stated mission is to promote so-called family values - in other words to counter the left-wingers by bringing conservative Christian values back to Hollywood, one film at a time. In Bridges, the Christian angle (also present in the book) is introduced in a visit to church and a discussion between 10 and 11-year olds about whether believing in Jesus will keep you from going to hell. The scene is an obvious intrusion that seems out of place in the context of the film.Filmed in New Zealand and set in an unnamed rural area, Jesse Aarons (Josh Hutcherson) is a fifth grader who is bullied by his classmates presumably because he is poor and likes to draw. In the wonderful world of Disney, bullying consists of stealing twinkies and charging money to go to the bathroom (heck, I had to pay protection money just to stay alive). Jesse never responds even though his athletic build indicates that he would more than hold his own in a fight. His home life offers no solace either.His parents heap a lot of attention on his four sisters and either ignore Jesse or constantly yell at him. Only his music teacher (Zooey Deschanel) in the rural school recognizes his talent and takes him to an art museum. Why the teachers do not caution the bullies or try to stop their actions is unclear. Attempting to show off his running skills, Jesse enters a racing competition but is beaten by Leslie Burke (AnnaSophia Robb), a new girl in his class who has moved next door to him. In spite of her good looks and bubbly personality, Leslie's tomboyishness and ability as a writer keep her on the outside looking in and the two form a tentative friendship based on mutual need.Leslie's parents are free-spirited writers who are absorbed in their work, leaving Leslie and Jesse to spend their after school hours in imaginative play where they create a world called Terabithia in the forest that surrounds their home. In Terabithia, trees become giants, squirrels turn into beasts, and Jesse and Leslie gain magical powers. Of course, they fight actual battles with attackers so the line between what is real and what is imagined is blurred and the film can straddle both worlds. Through his interaction with Leslie, however, Jesse begins to come out of his shell and develop some self confidence but a tragic turn compels him to use all of his new found strength just to stay afloat.The heart of the film of course is the friendship between the two pre-teens and its success depends on whether or not you believe that they are troubled outcasts eager to escape from the harsh reality of their world. Robb, however, with her perpetual smile and high energy never seems real in the role of a social misfit and Hutcherson has only a few expressions, most of which are variations of sullen and the two leads lack any discernible chemistry together. In spite of a few genuinely touching moments, Bridge to Terabithia never feels authentic - either as a fantasy or as a tale of friendship and loss.",Bridge to Terabithia
36,TheMovieDiorama,Bridge to Terabithia has the essence of a children's fantasy with a hint of adult drama.,7,24 February 2018,"This was not the film I thought it was going to be. Looking at the cover, I see plenty of fairies and a luscious kingdom as a backdrop. Sure, those elements are incorporated but the beauty of this melancholic tale is how these friends survive reality. Two friends decide to use their imagination to create a visionary world called Terabithia. Acting as an escape from reality, the two form a close bond where they choose to help each other through situations in reality. Filmed through the perspective of children, we watch their views on certain life qualities: family, friendship, love and loss. The imaginary world juxtaposes with the often harsh reality they reside in. Forceful parents, countless bullies at school, lack of friends...all naturally occurring aspects in one's life. Our protagonist then uses his artistic skills to escape these and his new friend opens his mind to the use of imagination, or more like role-play. The reason why I say melancholic, is because of that ending. Powerful? Sure. Was it needed? Definitely. It shows how developed the main character is throughout his childhood, a very short duration of time. Hutcherson and Robb have beautiful onscreen chemistry, I really adored the attention to detail regarding their friendship. Madison was particularly outstanding as Jess's younger sister. The story was well paced, heartwarming and surprisingly a faithful adaptation. I felt the visual effects were sub-par, especially for a fantasy flick, and the usage of Terabithia felt limited. I wanted more. It just couldn't decide from being a fantasy film or a coming-of-age drama where occasionally the two just do not mix well. Also, a teacher would not ask a student to go to the museum on a weekend. Not in this day and age. However, this is an above average family fantasy drama that can entertain younger audiences and emotionally stimulate mature viewers. Just, open your heart to the film and the ending will hit you.

Together with Jess's art skills and Lesile's vivid imagination they create a magical enchanting world which can only be accessed through a magical rope (as they have to swing to the other side of the forest to get to the other side).Meanwhile when they are in school Jess gets bullied by some mean boys at school,along with a tough girl. As Jess and the young girl are having a blast with their new world will tragedy strike for one of them?SO what did I think about it well the acting is great in this especially Robert Patrick from Walk The Line who plays Josh's charcther's dad in the movie.

I'm not gonna lie but the tragedy with Lesile never fails to make me cry so hard(and yes after re-eding this review I'm 30 years old btw).Also starring in this film is Zooey Deschneal (who I swear is the love child of Katy Perry). She plays Jess's music teacher.Overall this film is really good especially if your a person who daydreams a lot and like drawing and breaking free from the real world.I really enjoyed it and for that its a 7 out of 10.Check it out and see what you think of it,but be warned you may need tissues for this film.",Bridge to Terabithia

The rest would wade into hobbies or imaginary world - as we see in Bridge to Terabithia where two loners/ soul-mates find their time and place to exit real problems and difficulties. Well, it is logical, but it appears as a recommendation for others suffering from bullying, abusive family etc. - which is definitely not the best way of encouragement. The plot is also not too smooth, the most interesting part is Leslie and Jesse together until the certain twist, the ending is a bit insipid, the introductory part has too many clichés; digital effects, however, are splendidly made. But the cast is nicely strong, both children and adults, particularly Josh Hutcherson, AnnaSophia Robb, Robert Patrick, Zooey Deschanel.All in all, the movie in question is a above-average creation, with lots of realistic elements concerning most of families. One must still bear in mind that its undertone rather gloomy than positive, being not suitable for every child.",Bridge to Terabithia

However, Jess and Leslie are neighbours, and eventually, become friends.They get together in a forest where at first, only Leslie is brave enough to cross a stream via a swinging rope. When Jess joins her, they invent a fantasy land in the forest on the other side of the stream they call ""Terabithia"", a place where the trees turn into trolls, and they build a tree-house amongst them.Jess is also enamoured with his new music teacher, played by Zooey Deschanel, and fatefully accepts a trip to the museum with her, rather than another trip to Terabithia.I expected ""Bridge to Terabithia"" is be a pure fantasy, based on its marketing.

41,Polaris_DiB,An idyllic elegy,10,18 June 2007,"When I went around breathlessly telling everybody about this movie after I saw it, I was met with skepticism, cynicism, and especially a direct correlation of those-who-saw-the-trailer to those-who-didn't-want-to-see-it. I need to state this right out, before all other comments on this movie: the trailer was awful, and this movie is not a Chronicles of Narnia-style vehicle for Disney. Sharing thematic elements with Narnia (the book mentions this connection as well), this is a story about friendship and grief, and it is highly personal, beautiful, and endearing. It is, in fact, one of the best children's movies I have ever seen.Gabor Csupo (of Nickelodeon animation fame) endows these children's lives with light and shadow, personal moments, and telling faith, while the children return the favor by doing some of the best acting of the year. Anna Sophia Robb has more charisma and chemistry than the world's leading actors, and it's hard not to believe that these two children aren't in love with each other, which is what makes the story so much more painful.Bridge to Terabithia is a story about a ten year old farmer boy named Jess, caught among four sisters, bullied by the regular crew of hurtful bullies, and generally just wanting to spend his time drawing, when a new girl-next-door named Leslie ruins everything--she becomes his best friend, and they design an escapist realm called ""Terabithia"" in the woods behind their houses, an area of play and abstraction pretty much exactly like my experiences as a kid in the woods, only a bit wetter. The first five minutes, are, perhaps, an exercise in children's-movie contrivance, with all of the more overt and unrealistic styles of verbal abuse of the other children, but once Jess gets past his initial distrust of Leslie and the two become friends, the film transcends itself into a realm of imagination more poignant (and tellingly more simple) than the line of contemporary fantasy currently being produced.This movie is both an idyll and an elegy, combining a poetic sense of the world and a love of a child's viewpoint with a deep understanding of the pain and reality of both. In other words, it's surprising for Disney--no wonder they mis-marketed it, it's actually worth something! In this movie are theological discussions, realizations of love, heavy moments of pain, and an uncanny personal connection, all things that have been mismanaged or done poorly a thousand times before, but that Csupo finally gets right. He gets into these character's heads better than any adult ever could visually, and even has command of devices like foreshadowing and symbolism often never seen beyond the art-film circuit.After seeing this movie, I immediately spent another two hours reading the book. It, too, uses it's methods appropriately and details a world and a story poignantly and majestically. ""Bridge to Terabithia"" is a story that should be experienced, in whatever form, for it is a beautiful and loving ode to the experiences that define childhood and growing up.--PolarisDiB",Bridge to Terabithia

Together they play in a forest with their imaginations working in overdrive, creating new lands and creatures - they call this Terabithia.Whilst the first 2 thirds of the film, exploring the imaginations of the kids plus difficulties at home and school is done well, it is the third act which raises this up and gives the film something of a reputation. There is a significant tragedy and the film follows the impact this has and manages to do this without drawing on the need for sickly sentimentality.

The special effects, story, characters, drama, and themes were all first-rate in this wonderful adaptation of the novel. They probably should have left the forest scenes to the viewer's imagination, but this did not detract from the story. In fact, it added to it. It was pretty faithful to the novel, with the exception of having to update it with such elements as the internet.The story features a kid trying to fit in at school. When a new girl moves in, she tries to do the same. They wind up forming a close friendship and creating in imaginary world all their own in the forest. It is a great world. Much of the drama focuses in on conflicts at school and home, and their working it out in the imaginary world.Possible spoiler ahead.Unfortunately, tragedy strikes.

In this film it goes a different way and don't show the death at all. The film focuses on the emotions of the characters instead. It also makes us argue who is responsible and if it could have been avoided, which was a fantastic dilemma. Also this whole film is about the importance of imagination and the thing that they left the death to our imagination is genius.

50,p-stepien,Well bridged to the target,7,16 June 2013,"""Bridge to Terrabithia"", a deservedly beautiful and charming adaptation of the source material by Katherine Patterson, delivers a somewhat poignant story bound to capture the target audience by the heart. The story's main protagonist Jess Aarons (Josh Hutcherson) lives on the countryside with his financially-stressed family, at times lacking required warmth and care from his crass father Jack (Robert Patrick). Somewhat of a school loner, often targeted by school bullies, Jess hardly has any friends, hence spending most of his time and creative energy in drawing fantasy worlds or googling at his beautiful music teacher Ms Edmunds (Zooey Deschanel). When a family of writers moves next door, Jess quickly finds a common language with the spirited and independent-minded Leslie Burke (AnnaSophia Robb). Together they indulge into their own world of imagination across a local stream - a fairy land inhabited by trolls, creatures of light and dark, in which the duo self-proclaim themselves king and queen. This inner world of fantasy soon transcends into their everyday life...The movie, now slowly turning into a classic, possibly failed to prove a financial success due to the heavy themes of death, passing, acceptance of loss and a rejection of close-minded views of others, which make it a much more laden story to tell, than parents or children normally expect. Especially given the story is actually pretty sparse on magical creatures and extraordinary adventures, much below what even I personally expected. Fronted by two tremendously well played characters - with Robb especially capturing the eye with some astoundingly charismatic presence - ""Road to Terrabithia"" manages to captivate attention, immediately warming up to the audience.Devoid of a simplistic purely positive outlook on live or intense CGI fuelled visuals, this movie may prove one of those unexpected first adventures into the tougher realities of life. Where bullies aren't pure evil. Where first loves must be lived. And where death must be accepted. All well converged to a language well adjusted to its target audience of young teens. Truly inspirational watching, which is bound even to entice the more sarcastic outlook of adults, forcing them to reminisce with their own moments of coming of age.Nonetheless, the opening third of the movie drags slowly, failing to pick up tempo and leaving an overwhelming feeling that some initial opportunities had been loss to better build the background to Jess and Leslie. Also I had the intense feeling that modern standards of youth-oriented films fail to prepare youth to a darker take on reality, thus making it a somewhat unwanted treasure by those who truly should immerse into the message it offers. Maybe a bit more pizazz to liven up proceedings could have made audience better acclimatise to the heavy laden issues lurking around the script corner? Nonetheless, this is a minor question, not faulting the pretty adventurous direction chosen by director Gabor Csupo, who truly focused on the content, bigger picture, not on delivering an enthralling picturesque extravaganza, which is easy for the eyes and the mind.",Bridge to Terabithia
51,Rob_Taylor,How to shatter childhood dreams....with a really BIG rock!,5,22 August 2009,"For the majority of this movie, I was reasonably well entertained and it has a simple charm that automatically endears it to the viewer, no matter what their age.But be warned, gentle reader, that this is all part of the wind-up to one of the most jarring and (in my opinion) unnecessarily abrupt changes of mood that will leave you scowling at the screen and wondering just what kind of movies are considered ""kid safe"" these days.For those that have small children I'd seriously advise avoiding this movie. The very, very young will likely not catch on to what has happened, but parents should expect a raft of awkward questions from anyone in the 5-9 age group about life, death and what is going on.To summarise, after making a new friend (his only real friend), Jesse, the main character, is abruptly told that said friend has died. To add insult to injury at this point, the likely circumstances of the death are then spelt out to him, scene by scene, in some bizarre act of cruelty.Although such sudden and pointless deaths are a facet of our real lives, to see this played out in a film which is essentially a childhood fantasy is quite awful. Sure, life is hard, but do we really want our kids to learn this fact from a movie? To be brief, after this scene, the whole movie turned rather sour. In another head scratching move, all of the lead character Jesse's other problems appear to resolve themselves after the death in some weird ""every cloud has a silver lining"" kind of effect.Additionally, if I was a kid, with a very real seeming fantasy world I could visit, and my best friend had just died, I'm pretty sure I'd imagine that friend still alive in the fantasy world. But not in this movie. It's like Jesse's imagination has some freakish block - I can imagine things that never existed, but not someone I was very close to?In short, don't take sensitive kids to see this film. Used to be, Disney films were a safe bet for parents. These days....not so much. It's a good, charming film ruined by dragging reality into it. Unsatisfying would be the politest term I would use to describe this movie.",Bridge to Terabithia

I liked the idea of Terabithia, but wish this movie had more of it, and less real world drama where child actors come off coached or with dialog that sometimes doesn't come off as what a 12 or 7 yr old would say. Other things that annoyed - the adult acting especially by the girl's parents and the older teacher was quite poor as well, and I've mostly disliked putting music on where dialog should be; several times the movie turned into a bad music video. Regardless of the book, the movie I thought could've worked better if they showed just enough of the real world to let us know the troubles - say maybe 20 min of the film, and then spend another 70-90 min in Terabithia which was very well done. But instead it's more like 20 min in Terabithia and 70 min in the real world. Thus the movie falls somewhat short.",Bridge to Terabithia
53,lewiskendell,Powerful.,9,12 July 2010,"""So I realize that if it's hard for me, how much harder it must be for you.""There are very few movies that inspire a genuine emotional response from me. Something beyond the superficial momentary humor, happiness, and sadness that is the basis of so many films. Movies like The Wrestler, Million Dollar Baby, and Forrest Gump all take the viewer beyond the passive experience of watching, to the active experience of feeling exactly what the characters are feeling. Bridge to Terabithia is most definitely another one of those movies. I kid you not when I tell you that the last part of the movie left me stunned in a way that took me quite a while to get over. It's also one of the best films about what being a kid is actually like. Dealing with issues that adults can't even handle well, like loss and loneliness and problems at home. And it handles those issues in an adult way that pushes Bridge to Terabithia far beyond the label of ""kid's movie"". Sure, it's about friendship and imagination and other topics that are the cornerstones of movies for kids, but those subjects are only the tip of the iceberg. There isn't much fault to find with it, beyond the heavy emotional toll it may take on those who are too young or unprepared to deal with the subject matter. There are a few unnecessary and non-mainstream ideas about Christianity that the movie would have been better served by leaving out, but I can't find fault with anything else. The cast was great, the special effects were imaginative and well done, and all the elements combined together in manner that just felt ""right"".

54,Chase_Witherspoon,Bridge to Terrific Cinema Storytelling,9,2 July 2010,"The wonders of Terabithia might appeal to the pre-pubescent crowd, but the walking, talking trees won't necessarily reach an adult audience. Fortunately, director Csupo knows how to manipulate the child in all of us, and, still talk to the adult outside. I knew nothing about the story before I embarked on the film, but was pleasantly surprised by the capable leads (Hutcherson and Robb), and impressed that the tragedy explored in the picture, was handled with so much tact and maturity.Something more for the adults - perhaps more-so the male cohort - is the appearance of the beguiling Zooey Deschanel. I'm not entirely sure her gaze and tone weren't a little suggestive (maybe even seductive), and that's perhaps a miscalculation, but it might also just have been my bias. Be mesmerised by those eyes, or, just imagine you were Hutcherson with the decision he had to make - accept your teacher's invitation to visit the museum for an edifying private lesson, or, hang-out with your neighbour for whom you have a secret crush. It's an internecine gambit, the kind the devil makes you choose in return for your soul.The artwork is imaginative and the set-work gritty and realistic. Tough guy Patrick (forever synonymous with T2) is actually quite effective as the firm but fair father, and Madison is undeniably cute as a button as Hutcherson's baby sister. The strengthening of their relationship is a silver lining on the otherwise depressing cloud, but I'd defy many to watch this moving climax without the Kleenex nearby.Great family viewing with something substantial for every age group.",Bridge to Terabithia

No, this is not an effects movie. This is a movie about friendship and how to overcome the harsh reality of this world.For parents out there, you should consider the PG rating because young kids will be heartbroken to find what will happen in the movie.

Josh Hutcherson and Anna Sophia Robb both have great connection with each other as friends but I will admit one small thing bothered me about the film, although I'm not going to spoil it here.Terabithia doesn't focus on effects and action.

The children depicted are very real and likable (well, except for the ones you're supposed to dislike, that is), and easy to identify with. The movie is a faithful and touching adaptation of the beloved children's classic book.The two main characters, Jesse and Leslie (splendidly played by John Hucheson and Annasophia Robb) are typical pre-teens, steering their way through the routine ups and downs kids everywhere deal with, and they develop a friendship/first crush due to their common interests and challenges. They find an old tree house, and create a fantasy castle type kingdom complete with magic, and populated by creatures based on people they know. Unlike so many other fantasy movies, this world is just an amusement for them, not a refuge that they actually ""enter."" The animation effects of this fantasy kingdom are skillfully executed in such a manner as to point out the reality that exists alongside the fantasy. For example: a tree begins to move, comes to life and performs an action, then relaxes back into its ""real"" position.The relationships of all the characters, and what they learn from their experiences, are the true focus, with the fantasy sequences only spicing what's happening. There are many themes touched upon: friendship, tragedy, adventure, creativity, bullies, competition, family life, even making an enemy to a friend. I liked all the characters and the actors that played them; each person helped build the story. Emotional, even heart wrenching in one case, this movie is a gem.

58,SusieSalmonLikeTheFish,Totally Unforgettable,10,8 October 2014,"It isn't very often that you find such complex and original characters in a kid's film, but Bridge to Terabithia is a strange, depressing and yet beautiful and hopeful film that honestly every kid (and adult too) should be required to watch.The plot seems innocent enough; Jess' family is on the verge of total poverty and they live in a small town appearing to take place in the 1970's-1980's. I'm not entirely certain since a few background kids had cellular phones. Anyway, Jess is always the target of bullying, has annoying sisters and gets second-hand girl's shoes from his older sister. His parents are strict and he thinks he's just a boring kid with no future, until he meets Leslie, a nonconformist girl who has hippie-like parents and doesn't watch television, much to the astonishment of her new classmates. She starts spending time in the woods with Jess, to live in their imaginary world, Terabithia. Meanwhile they befriend a caring music teacher and learn that bullies are often troubled at home, when the biggest school bully, Janice, gets beat by her dad and abused.When a sudden tragedy destroys their friendship forever, Jess has to decide how he wants to spend the remainder of his teenage years. However, Leslie's fatal accident teaches him several lessons, and much to his surprise, Janice the bully starts being nice to him, his crabby teacher bursts into tears in front of him and confesses her feelings of grief for her deceased husband, and Jess' father finally expresses how much he loves Jess.Parents today like to keep the topic of death away from kids, which isn't totally a bad thing, but it leaves them unprepared. Many kids lose someone sooner or later, whether it's a friend, pet, family member or neighbor, it can leave an imprint on them forever. I never got over my best friend's murder when I was fifteen and I doubt I ever will. This film proves though that from death you can still love a person and not take their memory in vain by taking the lessons they gave you and giving to another person's life. Leslie's death is somewhat disturbing, but this isn't a horror film, her death isn't shown on-screen, just talked about later on.The film isn't just about dealing with grief, it's about getting through hard times, family matters, dealing with bullies and hearing both sides to every story. The characters are very realistic and the soundtrack is amazing (thank god this film hasn't been touched by pop music). Bailee Madison from the popular TV series The Haunting Hour was great in the role of Jess' little sister May Belle, in fact the acting was generally very excellent, especially when you consider that many of the actors/actresses were kids and teens.There are some stories about real friendship that have stayed with me. The Lovely Bones by Alice Sebold, No Place for Eco-Sinners by Racheal Bates, Becoming Chloe by Cathrine Hyde, and Mr. Death's Blue Eyed Girls by Mary Hahn.

60,sarastro7,Harsh fare for kids,5,1 May 2007,"I don't usually watch children's movies (I'm 35 and I don't have kids), but since I tend to like fantasy movies, I thought I'd see this one. Unfortunately, it didn't have much fantasy in it. It was about using imagination as an escape from a harsh reality, and this point is well taken. I have been a dreamer since I was around that age, too. But the whole imagination thing was never developed very far, and what little we saw of the Narnia-like fantasy world was shallow and clichéd. So one is left to wonder what the real point of the movie was.Like every kid who sees this movie, I was pretty shocked that the girl died, and I do think that was a very harsh thing to put in a children's movie. It was almost like showing that the harsh reality is stronger than the imagination, and you can't escape from it. Is that a constructive message? Is that the kind of thing children need to hear?I wonder if the story was some kind of Christian thing, relating to sex and ""original sin"". After all, where could the story have gone from there except in a sexual direction if this boy/girl friendship had continued for much longer? And, it seemed a bit like Leslie was killed because Jess momentarily decided to focus his attention on the pretty music teacher instead. I.e., as soon as he started having thoughts and feelings of a sexual nature - esp. towards another -, the whole ""original sin""/adultery thing came home to roost, and Leslie was taken from him. I don't know if this was intentional from the author's side, but it seems a little like it to me. And if it is the case, the story is a harsh Christian morality tale, which I really don't think anybody should be subjected to.All in all, I don't think the movie made much sense, nor presented it message very well.

When the Leslie character walks into the classroom, I thought she stole my heart in 3 seconds flat, then I took hold of myself and remembered Emma Watson and Dakota Fanning. Whew! The scenes in the school (a mess) and those in the home (another mess) are 100% on target; never falling into the awful false rut we see in most films and TV. This is a movie to be proud of, but anything made by today's Disney --- including the stunningly successful but nonetheless mediocre films by Pixar --- can't hold a candle to those made by Walt Disney. This also extends to the family fare made in that era by MGM, Fox, Warners and others. Timeless classics which endure for generations.While any young person today would be lucky to find their own Terabithia the film jogged my memory to recall that in Silver Spring, MD at that age we were surrounded by an even more wondrous land --- part imagination, part real --- which included a castle, a pagoda (both real), a swamp, an African jungle, 17th Century England, Tombstone AZ, and more. That world still lives in my imagination but is gone in reality. It was replaced by parts of the Washington DC Beltway, Holy Cross Hospital, the Mormon Temple, and a soon-to-be condo.

63,Stampsfightclub,A dramatic coming of age fantasy adventure,8,24 August 2008,"Josh Hutcherson stars as young bullied Jess Aarons, a teenager who finds school life difficult and at the start of a new school year, Jess meets Leslie, a strong minded teenager who shows Jess the fun side of life.Not expecting an awful lot from this film, I must say that it made my day once I got into it, as a beautiful story about friendship is unravelled in a true teenage coming of age fantasy adventure.Hutcherson is very good as central character Aarons, who has a load on his shoulders, as every teenager does, and the moody dark selfish turns are all well established by the young actor, and even adults will be able to identify with his attitude.And having the moody teen, left room for the fun loving energetic character, and AnnaSophia Robb is superb as Leslie, the person who brings Jess out of the light.The two personalities work well together, and though the dialogue and the ideology are conventional, the sentimental feeling of friendship is very strong.The plot does follow many conventions, such as the young hero who is an outcast. Some of the jokes are very corny and the imagination behind Terabithia was very bizarre.But the film differs in a way that is very shocking, and something that I wouldn't expect from a family film, which will have you close to tears by the end.Having the land of Terabithia provided escapism for the pair, and is a concept which every human will have felt, just to get away from reality and into your own world.The concept of bullying is well covered, as is school life, and the dramatic turns every school kid goes through justifies teenage life perfectly.The acting is good as is the visual effects and though an inconsistent plot with bizarre imagination and jokes, the whole concept of Jess' and Leslie's lives is remarkable and differs from a conventional family film by being shocking and more realistic in its own context, a true teenage fantasy drama.",Bridge to Terabithia
64,fwomp,A Very Wobbly Crossing,3,2 July 2007,"There's more than one bridge that is lacking in BRIDGE TO TERABITHIA. Trying to ascertain who this movie is targeted at is one that many parents won't be able to cross, as well as gaps in almost all the fantasy elements.Teasers and trailers would have most potential viewers believe it to be on-par with LORD OF THE RINGS or NARNIA. Perhaps not in production standards but at least in the story's fantasy elements. Not so. The screenplay and direction seemed to be at odds with the story, trying to infuse more childlike wonder and imagination but being stymied by coherency and some very shabby acting and dialogue.Bridge To Terabithia is based on Katherine Patterson's Newberry Award winning children's book by the same name. Given a wobbly structure by picture standards rather than anything approaching a solid children's story, the film fails not only in entertaining visuals but also in that the themes that run through Patterson's books are never given their comeuppance. We can see them more than feel them, which is a bummer considering how important some of the issues Patterson covers in her novels.Josh Hutcherson (ZATHURA) stars as Jesse Aarons, a middle school boy with adult responsibilities on his parents' farm. Living in the boondocks, Jesse is the butt of bullies and jokesters at his school. Finding comfort in his drawings, Jesse immerses himself in them, trying to escape life's cruel realities. He's a loner even amongst his family, where his sisters and parents rarely acknowledge his existence. Then one day a young girl arrives at his school and opens Jesse's mind to the unseen. AnnaSophia Robb is Leslie Burk (CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY), the daughter to fiction writers who takes a liking to Jesse. Running into the backwoods near their homes, Jesse and Leslie form a friendship based on escapism and fantasy. But the worlds begin colliding as Jesse and Leslie take their made-up world and incorporate its sense of right and wrong on the real one. The results are no big surprise. The bullying stops. Respect is achieved. Toughness grows.The largest problem with the story is that its target audience is a complete mystery. The dialogue is junior enough to be in league with films such as THE LABYRINTH but the themes are often adult, including extrapolations on the need for God and religion as well as how to deal with an emerging sexual attraction for a teacher, and the death of a student. These dichotomies were just too broad to be ...um ...bridged.The other issue is the out-and-out misconception that this is some sort of visually stunning fantasy movie. It isn't. These elements are few and often incongruous with the trailers that littered screens before its release or on parallel DVDs that beg you to rent or buy this film, too.Bridge To Terabithia isn't for young kids and it will bore and/or anger adults to the point where they'll want to banish the DVD posthaste from whence it came.",Bridge to Terabithia
65,gregsrants,Who did they make this movie for?,3,18 February 2007,"Here we go again. Another movie based on a popular best-selling novel whose pages have never graced my nightstand. In fact, unlike the Harry Potter series (another adventure string of books that I have no time or desire to engage in reading) I had never even heard of Bridge to Terabithia before the trailer started appearing at my local theatre. Had the commercial ads not informed me that it was based on a novel, I would have been none the wiser.Anyone that has read my rantings over years knows that I don't invest the time in the turning of printing pages. For the most part I have argued that this negligence has put me in a good position when it comes to reviewing films based on literary works. I don't have to worry about pre-conceived ideas on what characters should look like, differences between page and screen plot points and entire chapters or characters that are left out of the movie experience for any number of pacing or continuity reasons. I go in with a clean slate and I don't have to go much further than The DaVinci Code to tell you how much less frustration I seemed to devour than those who had read the book multiple times before their big screen experience.Bridge to Terabithia, based on the book by Katherine Paterson, is the story of two children, Jesse Aaron (Josh Hutcherson) and Leslie Burke (Anna Sophia Robb) who escape all the troubles and pressures of school bullies and parental ignorance by entering into an imaginative, creative world they call Terabithia. In Terabithia they have powers that are limited only in their imagination and are surrounded by fairies, trolls and some hedgehog looking creatures that snarl and attack with ferocious intent.Both Jesse and Leslie are in need of some distraction. Jesse comes from a home where his father's attention is fractured between his five children and the incoming bills are more than the incoming income. At school, Jesse is even more displaced. Bullies rule his adolescent world and his young sister hangs on him giving him little time for the things that children take for granted in modern day society.Leslie has just moved to town and become Jesse's neighbor. Her family is a little more functional, but with both parents being writers, she glides under the radar when each new book is in production. She too finds trouble in the schoolyard where the female bullies have such a stronghold on the recess population that they can even dictate who has access to the public washroom.Their escape to Terabithia was a welcome distraction.Bridge to Terabithia perplexed and challenged me in many ways. From the ads, I thought I was in store for a fantasy adventure. Instead, I was subjected to a childhood drama that felt more awkward than rewarding. As the minutes past tirelessly through the screening, I kept anticipating the trolls, the giants, the special effects that seemed so predominant in the marquee posters (me, and the hundred or so children that also looked disappointed and confused over the lack of fantasy). You really have to wait until the final scene before you are finally graced with the presence of CGI, which again would be fine if that is what you were expecting and forked out the cash for at the box office ticket counter.Further scrunching my brow was the knowledge that Bridge to Terabithia was a Disney release. This made the subject matter explored in the adventure even more head scratching. Child abuse, a conversation about the existence and punishment of God, and the death of a main character made me uncomfortable  probably due to an understanding that 99% of the audience brought their younglings to the screening not knowing they would be subjected to such heavy handed plot topics.And then there was the few special effects in the film. The small creatures in the forest, the fairies, the troll, the attacking birds. The effects were so cheesy and unrealistic that I could not believe that the studio that the mouse built was behind the operation. It was as if they wanted to make another Chronicles of Narnia, but got Roger Corman and Terry Gilliam to helm the project.Bridge to Terabithia will be a film that might make its modest budget back in ticket revenue, but be warned, this is not a movie for the very young, and there is nothing there for the adult customer.

66,jdkraus,A remarkable film!,8,30 June 2007,"I've read the book and I have seen the 1985 made for T.V. movie. Seeing it again, in a modern-day version is another great awakening of the famous tale of friendship ""Bride to Terabithia"".The story is about two kids. One is talented with drawing and the other with writing. Jesse Aarons (Josh Hutcherson) is a ""farm boy"" who is pervasively bullied and is the lead runner at his school. He lives under one roof with his parents, who are a bit in a money crisis, along with four sisters, whom all neglect him except for one.One day, a new girl Leslie Burke (AnnaSophia Robb) arrives at his school. She befriends Jesse and ""opens his mind"" to the imaginary world of Terabithia. Together, they develop a solid relationship and explore many ways of how to get back at the school bullies, as well as trail on philosophical subjects, including death. I'll stop here, because I don't want to ruin the film for you.But I will claim that, ""Bridge to Terabithia"" is an amazing film for all ages. It can be called a ""feel good movie"" but it also has some very sad moments to it. The acting between Josh and AnnaSophia is far-by excellent, especially for kids their ages. AnnaSophia is phenomenal as the creative, charming, and comical Leslie. And Josh creates a very ambivalent character, who delivers his performance extremely well. Bailee Madison was also great as Josh's naïve little sister May, who looks up to him as an idol.But I want to warn you that this is not a CGI based film like the Chronicles of Narnia. There are some great visuals in it, but its nothing large or substantial like Narnia. Nor is it a good vs. evil kind of story. Instead of that original storyline, it is a very good and touching film that can absorb both adults and children with imagination, and such emotion that may leave you adults in tears of both joy and sorrow. I nearly cried in this film (which I rarely do), but I clapped at the end, which I also rarely do.But the one thing that bothered me with this film was the music. It sounded too much like MTV (one of the sponsors) rather than a kid's film. It needed more of a melodic score like John Williams' score for Hook. 9/10",Bridge to Terabithia

Searching for a movie to see in Amsterdam theatres I came across this movie name  English language movie, children's movie and new release  those were the three things that drew me to the theatre.The movie is based on a Katherine Paterson's 1978 award winning best children fantasy novel. The adaptation is done by Walt Disney Pictures. Even though the movie is / was intended to be a children fantasy  the way it was presented  I as an audience saw it as - A warm love story between coming to age of neighbors  boy and a girl  of may be around 14 years of age played by Josh Hutcherson and AnnaSophia Robb respectively. They meet each other and the girl brings a new perspective outlook in the life of the boy  who lives an adolescent confusion through constant bickering by his parents. The boy and girl find a place in their nearby woods where like all of us did when we were kids  fantasize! It is not the fantasy that was exciting  but the idea of innocence  the tag line ""Keep an open mind"" and you will see and imagine the most interesting things in your world.I liked the movie  if you do not have aversions to children's movie and have an open mind  and slightly like the inert angle of love  this is the movie for you. I have not read the novel so can't comment on the perfection of adaptation  but how do I care?

70,SquigglyCrunch,Bad Actors and Unrealistic Characters Make this Movie Hard to Enjoy,3,25 May 2016,"Bridge to Terabithia follows a young boy without any friends until the new girl joins his school. Together they discover a forest and create a fantasy world within it where they can live away from the real world. The end of the movie was the best part of it. The characters become much more realistic and it manages to actually strike up a bit of emotion. I came close to crying twice at various points in the last 20 minutes. The rest of the movie isn't very good. The child actors are kind of bad, so it's hard to look past them and enjoy the movie for the plot and what-not. But in actuality the plot still isn't very good. It's basically just a couple of kids playing around in a tree house. Sure, they're conjuring up their own plot and stuff, but even then it's not really that interesting. Although I'm sure that plenty of kids would like the fantasy aspect of it.Probably the worst part of this movie are the characters. Everyone is an absolute jerk to the point where they're unrealistic. The writing for the main bully characters is especially bad. I can't really tell if it's on purpose or not, but it's really difficult to take any of it seriously. Maybe that's just because I wasn't bullied when I was younger so I can't relate, but I think that whether or not I've experienced something like this I should be able to relate to or at least understand why these characters would do these things. That's just good writing. The biggest thing that sets the tone of the movie off is the ending. While I thought it was the best part of the movie it switches the tone from childish and fun to realistic and depressing, and it makes me wonder if it was supposed to be a kid's movie or not. Just out of the blue it suddenly throws a pretty mature theme at the audience. so is it for kids or adults? As far as I'm concerned the kids will like the majority of the movie except the ending, and adults will like the ending and that's it. So who's this movie for? Unless there's something I'm missing here. Another big problem I had was the relationship between the main character and his music teacher. Apparently they were relatively close, yet the amount of interactions they have with each other can be counted on one hand. He holds a door open for her once or twice, stares at her creepily, and suddenly they're besties. It just didn't make any sense where their sudden closeness came from. Overall Bridge to Terabithia isn't that great of a movie. While there were aspects that I liked, nor was it a particularly horrible experience to watch, it wasn't really that well made. Maybe I'm missing something, but as far as I'm concerned this is a pretty poorly made movie. In the end I wouldn't recommend it.",Bridge to Terabithia

The story of young, and artistically talented, Jesse (Josh Hutcherson) who is sharing concerns and money problems with his family. He's having trouble at school with the bullies and there is a bully like troll who charges the kids a dollar to go and pee. He is fighting for the attention of his father, against his baby sister. Life for young Jesse isn't looking up, that is until the adventurous, imaginative and non-conformist Leslie (AnnaSophia Robb) arrives in town.

Adventures and amazement in other worlds centre around these two kindred spirits, and for once, for Jesse, life isn't so bad after all. If your mind is wide enough then let your imagination take you over the Bridge to Terabithia.This kid's, albeit family movie goes deeper than the standard fantasy movie, and his new soul mate has him believing that what we can imagine can become real; all it takes is a little courage and determination. The underling narrative here is that the fantasy is more nearer to home that he (Jesse) would like to admit, substituting bad memories and bad dealings at home, and at school, for the bad and dangerous enemies of Terabithia. Using one environment to create another, to imagine is to believe and to believe that it is real.A nice little movie that centres around the dealings of bullies and how one has to learn how to cope, and that all is not what it might seem.

78,cosmic_quest,Delightful coming-of-age film,8,24 October 2007,"'The Bridge of Terebithia' is an intelligent family film made in the manner of Disney classics like 'Old Yeller' and 'The Fox and the Hound', where things aren't always dressed up prettily just because many in the target audience are children.Based on the novel by Katherine Paterson, this film revolves around twelve-year-old Jesse, the only son of his working class parents' five children. Despite being a gifted artist, he feels insignificant in the midst of four sisters, pre-occupied parents and school bullies until he meets Leslie, a city girl whose family has moved to Jesse's small farming town. Leslie is a bright, outgoing, captivating child with a sense of adventure and a determination to stand out in a crowd yet, in the face of their differences, the two become firm friends. Bouyed by Leslie's genuine enthusiasm for life, Jesse helps her to create the imaginative kingdom of 'Terebithia' in abandoned woods by their homes, a world filled with trolls, exotic creatures and talking animals. But when reality soon seeks to crash down on the children's world, changing their lives forever, can Jesse hold on to the magic of Terebithia...The child actors in this film were phenomenal and carried the story with the grace of veteran actors who had decades of experience under their belts. Josh Hutcherson was excellent as Jesse, beautifully depicting how disenchanted the character was with life initially as he vied for the attention of a busy father and fought to make himself stand out from his sisters and classmates yet recaptured a boyish sense of joy through his friendship with Leslie. He also handled the darker scenes with remarkable poignancy. AnnaSophia Robb, in her role of Leslie, was no lead weight either. She gave a very likable performance and was perfect in depicting her character's heartfelt spirited-nature, without comprising the sense of vulnerability that clung to the character. Little Bailee Madison, as Jesse's five-year-old sister May Belle, definitely deserves a mention who was not only adorable but gave a genuinely captivating performance as Jesse's most loyal 'supporter'. Robert Patrick, one of the few adult actors to stand out in what is very much the child actors' film, was notable in his role as Jesse's father, a man who believed in showing his children the importance of hard-work, not realising his aloof nature was distancing his son from him, yet who did love his family very much even if he couldn't always demonstrate that effectively.The problem with this film was that it was marketed as if it was a fantasy-lite flick in the vein of 'Harry Potter' or 'The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe' when it is much more a coming-of-age film similar, in many ways, to 'My Girl', 'Jack the Bear' and 'Wide Awake'. The magic creatures and fantastic kingdom of Terebithia is only a small part of Jesse's journey. The primary thread of 'The Bridge to Terebithia' is about a boy standing on the cusp of puberty, the bridge between childhood and adulthood, and having to learn the harsh realities of life without letting go of his belief in magic and the jubilance of embracing his imagination.And, as a coming-of-age film, this succeeds very well in teaching children that, even if there is a darker side to the world, it doesn't mean it has to be a terrible place to live while also leaving adult viewers nostalgic for the time when they were Jesse's age and learning these lessons. If only Disney had the guts to produce more films like this instead of repetitive drudge they seem to enjoy oozing out for kids these days.This is definitely a highly recommended film for the family. A word of warning to parents. This film is rated 'PG', which means 'parental guidance', as in watch it first before deciding on whether it is suitable for your very young and/or sensitive children.",Bridge to Terabithia
79,refresh_daemon,"Great concepts, middling execution",6,22 July 2007,"I remember reading this book when I was younger, although my memories of it were quite foggy by the time I got around to watching the movie. Sadly, I cannot say that it was a great movie. Rather, it's a palatable movie that suffers a lot from the shift from book to movie.One thing that really threw me off is the acting of the children. Leslie was very sprite-like, but there was a serious artificiality to her performance that makes it very hard to believe she actually believes what she's saying. Jess on the other hand suffers from only using the acting range that Tom Welling practices on Smallville. That's not to say that Tom Welling's necessarily a limited actor, but that's to say that it's all I see in Jess and that weakens his characterization. Jess' younger sister Maybelle is quite cute and surprisingly believable as the annoying younger sister and most of the other players do a decent job with what little roles they have.I really remember loving the story when I was younger because it related directly to my own imaginative flights of fancy and the real-world portion was also relevant to me at the same time. However, when the story gets translated into a movie format, it drags a lot because, in the book, a lot of the conflict was inside the character rather than outside. And so we get stuck with a lot of brooding scenes (hence the Smallville reference) and not a lot of external conflict (or internal conflict fueling external conflict). With such weak hooks and lack of believability in the actors, it's hard to really get into the picture because there's nothing bringing you in and a whole lot making it hard to be similarly immersed.But it's not bad. In fact, the film shines best in the real world segments because the conflict is much more palpable and there is good drama there. It's just that when you have to suffer through all the less believable flights of fancy (not unbelievable because it's fantastic, but rather, because it's just not well driven or expressed), it really bogs down the film. I personally think a rewrite that reworks the story, or the perspective of the story, might have been good for its screen debut.But it's clean and simple and deals with issues that children sometimes have to face, which I can applaud it for. I just wish it were done in such a way that it drew me better into the story rather than emoting it to me. It's passable. 6/10.",Bridge to Terabithia

Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post praised the script for being ""utterly recognizable and authentic"", and thought Robb and Hutcherson were ""perfectly cast"". Hornaday wrote that although the final five minutes succumbed to ""oversweet sentiment"", viewers would remember the film's ""warmth and respect with which it pays homage to first love"". Jessica Grose of The Village Voice commended director Csupó for omitting ""cutesy tween stereotypes"", and felt Jess's relationship with his father elevated Bridge to Terabithia from ""a good kids movie to a classic contender."" The New York Times critic Jeannette Catsoulis believed that the fantasy was kept in the background ""to find magic in the everyday"", and thought Csupó directed ""like someone intimate with the pain of being different, allowing each personality more than a single characteristic"". The reviewer praised all the leads for their strong performances, especially Deschanel and Madison. Catsoulis found the film was able to handle adult topics ""with nuance and sensitivity"", and being consistently smart and ""delicate as a spider web"", it was the kind of children's movie ""rarely seen nowadays"".Miriam di Nunzio of the Chicago Sun-Times praised Hutcherson and Robb's performances, saying that ""the film's heart and soul rests on the abilities of its young lead characters to make us really see the world through children's eyes. The dynamic duo of Hutcherson and Robb do not disappoint.""",Bridge to Terabithia
81,Stompgal_87,Enchanting if tear-jerking,8,19 January 2014,"I remember seeing the trailer for this film and it looked so captivating I decided to see it for real accompanied by two support staff and a housemate from my former care home. The film enchanted me and kept me engaged for the most part but (SPOILER ALERT) when Jess heard that Leslie passed away, I burst into tears in shock because when I read the consumer advice (similar to the Parents' Guide here on IMDb) on the Children's BBFC website prior to seeing this film (SPOILER REPEATED), it said there was emotional distress when one of the lead characters finds out his best friend had drowned and I initially assumed it was a boy but upon learning it was Leslie, it was most unexpected.Sad part aside, the best assets of this film were the acting, the dialogue, some effective uses of cinematography (particularly Leslie's final shot of her waving goodbye to Jess whilst carrying her dog and running in the rain), the decent special effects, the beautiful scenery (especially that of Terabithia itself) and how a giant troll and some birds in Terabithia represent the school bullies. While the incidental music is pretty forgettable, the most memorable songs are 'Why Can't We Be Friends?' and 'Someday (as sung by Jess's class)' and AnnaSophia Robb's solo number over the end credits. The film mostly stayed true to the book (which I read after watching this film) albeit its periodical differences (for example, in the book, Jess and Leslie's class are required to watch a Jacques Cousteau documentary whereas in the film the documentary is about Bob Ballard). I also came across the Nostalgia Critic's review for this fairly recently and while he panned a couple of outdated elements, an insensitive comment from one of the bullies after Leslie's passing plus the overly-whimsical nature of Terabithia, he found Leslie's death and its aftermath handled maturely. I agree with him about the death scene being well-handled and the bully telling Jess he is the fastest kid in the class but I pretty much disagreed with everything else that was criticised in the review.Overall, this is a magical and captivating film despite its emotionally intense moments. 8/10.",Bridge to Terabithia
82,arieliondotcom,Spoilers: Bible- bashing Bore,2,11 May 2008,"Don't see this movie, with children or without. It is an excuse for Disney (which has a pro- homosexuality policy against the precepts of the Bible) to bash the Bible. No wonder they freely lied in the trailers about what the movie was about and took millions of dollars in under false pretext. Apparently lies aren't an issue for them since they act like the Bible is just a myth to be thrown off and anything you want in your imagination is the real thing to treasure. Not only is it not in the style of Narnia or other animated adventures it compares itself to in the trailer, but those very few scenes of any fantasy and animation that there are are all very poorly done. You can easily see the ""seams"" in the pasting of the animations over the live action. Just terrible.And the acting is as bad as the animation from children and adults alike. Two hapless young teens, the best looking, and most athletic, are outcasts (which in itself is a fantasy). They pal around with each other until the boy goes off on a field trip with the female teacher he has a crush on, alone. Oh yea, that happens all the time in 2007...another fantasy that pays no attention to the reality of sex abuse by female teachers these days against their male students. And the girl he pals around with drowns herself when she tries to visit ""their spot"" on her own.The parents who were portrayed as terrible in the beginning of the movie are suddenly nice, the bullies at the beginning of the movie are suddenly powerless, and the ugly teacher who was played with comic strictness at the beginning of the movie is suddenly, well, a teacher. The cute teacher who takes the boy on an outing is cute and brainless throughout.Everyone mourns the girl's death for a minute and a half until the boy feeds his fantasies again and subdues grief by dragging his little sister into fantasy land.Just a waste of time from start to finish that opens a lot of issues and closes none of them for children about the Bible, faith, imagination, death and the afterlife. Sad and something to avoid. If you found this movie relevant or making some kind of pithy statement about grief by withdrawing into our imagination, you should not be watching this movie but making an appointment for counseling.",Bridge to Terabithia
83,The_Amazing_Spy_Rises,Every young child should watch this movie,10,20 May 2008,"And I can guarantee that parents will enjoy it as well. It really is a great film that I've fallen in love with because of the message it sends to children: don't be afraid to use your imagination and be creative, because that's the best way to be happy.On the surface, BTT is a very simple film about two youngsters, both outcasts, who meet and share a bond of friendship that could last a lifetime. Using their imaginations, they create a magical fantasy world they call Terabithia, and the rope swing across the river serves as a ""bridge"". On the subtext, you have a film that's about living free and exploring your mind, and not being afraid to take risks and go for something new.What also stands out in this movie is the talent of two excellent young actors, Josh Hutcherson (Zathura and Firehouse Dog), and especially Annasophia Robb (Because of Winn Dixie and Jumper). Robb's take on Leslie Burke is wonderful, and she's one of the most likable characters I've seen in recent memory. Hutcherson is also extremely likable and I really enjoy watching this kid perform - he really knows how to show some emotion, and with the ending of this story, it's essential for this character. I don't know if it was intentional, but even though both of our leads are very young (They were about 14 years old when it was filmed), there is a very strong romantic connection between Hutcherson and Robb. The movie also features Robert Patrick as Hutcherson's father and Zooey Deschanel as a teacher. Both of these performances are strong, especially Patrick's.I was entranced by this beautiful story and found myself very emotional when we arrived at the end. It was marketed as a big fantasy adventure like Harry Potter, Narnia, or The Golden Compass, but it's a realistic journey about two kids who are discovering themselves and their fantastic fun along the way. Parents, this movie is a wonderful story to show your children, and I give it the highest recommendation I can.",Bridge to Terabithia

The best part of the film is the fact that it has a lot to say about children and the positive messages about literary creativity and religion do not hurt either. The visuals are not as strong as one might suggest, though this film is not necessarily a special effects extravaganza like other recent children's films. There are some moments that lack punch, especially between the adult actors, who seem dull here. Robb provides a fun performance and Hutcherson fairs rather well.

I read it about once or twice and each time put me in the magical world of Terabithia. After hearing about the movie, I was partially excited. If you did not know, every movie adaptation from a book is horrible. Either they take too much away or they add new things for the ""blockbuster effect."" Nevertheless, the movie was still a must see. Sitting in the theaters, I was quite surprised to see much adults. It seemed like they all came to see their favorite book come to life, as was I. Let me just warn you, the movie will blow your expectations out of the water! The acting, the directing, and seeing this book on the big screen was huge treat. I'm pretty sure they left all the things from the book on the screen, and everything was not expected. The acting, for one, is extremely well done. This was a huge surprise to everyone. The young actors in their roles obviously have huge careers ahead of them. The directing, the cinematography, and the editing was great. The movie also holds that special 'heart' I love to see. It was magical experience. And then we have the ending... I had some feeling that told me the director couldn't execute the feeling the book gave you. But let me tell you, they pull it off and make it just as sad and heartbreaking the book gave you. In fact, this has already became my favorite book adaptation. To sum it up, if your a big fan of the book, you will love this movie. Ignore your mind telling you it will suck because I was too surprised.

It's only when Leslie moves next door that his life changes, seemingly for the better and undoubtedly forever.But all is not as it seems.Don't be fooled by the title, this is not a fantasy movie; rather it is a character drama pitting the realities of life against the desire of the spirit to soar. At 12, anything is possible, but Josh simply needs someone to show him the way.There are excellent performances all around, including Zooey Deschanel as Josh's music teacher, surely on her way to a big career.

88,galensaysyes,Narnifying = falsifying,3,18 August 2007,"Before seeing this movie I hadn't read the original book; but a lot of people had. So why weren't there protests from some of them that the movie had falsified it into something it wasn't, for the sake of bigger box-office? I can imagine some junior executive at Disney with an assignment to find Narnia-like properties getting wind of a book with a magical kingdom in it, making the deal for it without reading it, and passing it up the chain, until, in time, the writer hired to do the treatment, with an injunction to make the most of the Narnia bits--castles, mythical creatures, fantasy battles--is forced to report back, after reading the book, that there _are_ no such bits: the book isn't a fantasy but a psychological study of a two kids who invent a pretend world that they _know_ is a pretend world. Disney (possibly remembering the bad image that a certain cable channel contracted when a prominent fantasist made public its rude treatment of her during the filming of her novels) is anxious to stay in good with the author of the book, so it courts her good opinion and even hires her son as a co-producer and writer, with the result that when the movie is done she publicly expresses her approval of it. Was it only money that stayed her tongue? She could hardly have missed noticing that by Narnifying her book the movie made nonsense of it. She didn't construct the story as a fantasy, and it can't be converted to one merely by declaring the make-believe world real. For example, if the children could bring it into being just by thinking it, they would have had that power from the start of the story; or, if they acquired it suddenly, it would have to come from somewhere; if it operated in only one place, the magic would be available to everybody, not only them; and so on. (I would add also that the fantasy world doesn't look like one out of two children's minds; it looks like the tricksy, ugly product of Hollywood effects technicians.) Turned into a fantasy, but without the logic of fantasy, the story no longer makes sense--unless one assumes that the kids are psychotic, and lost in their shared delusion; and then it becomes a dishonestly sentimental account of the tragedy that ensues when they don't get the treatment they need. (There's a somewhat similar lack in the book, in that it doesn't come to grips with the ethics of risk-taking, even when it's fatal.) And there's one worse thing: in addition to turning what might have been a quiet, small study of childhood friends into a semi-cartoon, Disney has also made it a vehicle for one of its manufactured teen starlets, who is most unlike a serious, honest, open, rather boylike ten-year-old. The Leslie in this movie is a posing plastic doll, without an ounce of real feeling or credibility: Lindsay Lohan + Keira Knightley + Bratz. The movie has many more problems, ranging from the script (which misses everything in the book that wasn't stated in dialogue) to the casting (most of which is off by half); suffice it to say that nothing hangs right, nothing is the right shape: this isn't the real-world book or a reasonable facsimile: it's the Janice-troll version.",Bridge to Terabithia
89,huggibear,All you had to say was Disney and I was watching it for sure!,8,13 June 2017,"I adored this movie. Yes, it is fictional. Yes, it is fantasy or adventure as they call it here on IMDb. Yes, this is a family film for families with children who can understand exactly what using an imagination is all about. Disney has imagination! Josh Hutcherson, plays Jess in this film and wow, what a wonderful actor and a praiseworthy performance from him. I loved his character all the way through the film. If we raised children to have his kind of character in this film, we'd be living in heaven on earth. His eye contact was pure and I could see the emotion in him throughout the entire film. Who is this young man? His hair was done so cute in this film. I can't wait to see other films from him. He's a favorite now! I've seen him in a few others films and I remembered him from them. He truly carries this film from beginning to the end though. He establishes a bond with a new girl at school that ironically moves into the home right next to his family's home. They are the main characters and story line. This is a film I've had on my watch list to see and finally I'm glad I did. When you can clap at the end, you know it's worth watching at least once. Don't miss it, if given the chance to see it. You won't be disappointed. The music teacher (Zooey Deschanel) is a cutie too! I think I remember her from 500 Days of Summer. I also believe that Jess has a secret 'teacher' crush on her in this film.",Bridge to Terabithia

A Good Attempt, but Not Enough !!",6,27 February 2007,"For a film I wanted to believe in, ""Bridge to Terabithia "" leaves allot to be desired...Promoted for its' special effects, but they aren't shown until halfway into the movie,the heart of the movies centers around the two major leads, Jesse Aarons(Josh Hutcherson) and Leslie Burke(AnnaSophia Robb). Their work is Terrific !!! Jesse, the son of a struggling working farmer whose family needs additional funds to survive, and newcomer Leslie, whose search for a friend lands on Jesse.The troubles of adolescents is not lost on these two, as they have to deal with bullying on both sides of the aisle at school.The original work of the book is lost, as the film fails to establish the depth of the relationship, in any dramatic form, neither face a REAL conflict that brings them closer together, just mild uninvolved ones.Leslie and Jesse develop a close but platonic relationship. There common cause to create a world that they can live in.Growing up and developing imagination is encouraged, the real world mixed with some imaginary characters, kind of like cartoons and the nightly news.The dysfunction of Jesse's family and the cohesiveness of the Burkes is compared, and explored to some depth, but the twain only meet after the death of Leslie. Big Deal.The performances of all the actor are well done. But like I explained, the fault of the film lies in the dis-ingenuousness of the promoters as a Special Effects film, not as a coming of age.The ending is also somewhat disappointing, because while Jesse returns to Terabithia , it is less than fulfilling...So , if you like your peanut butter plain, then you will enjoy this film, but I prefer crunchy.Written for 8 to 12 year olds, more for females than males....",Bridge to Terabithia

92,arthera09,Good kids movie,7,8 February 2009,"I guess the only reason that I gave this movie a 7 and not a 6 was the realistic way that the movie built up how the kids were uncomfortable in their own world. A lot of time it feels to contrived, but they spent just the right amount of time and added a few important parts to make sure the kids and their desire for the imagined were justified. I loved AnnSophie Robb. I thought she was a younger equivalence of Natalie's Portman's character in Garden State, or just any quirky female character that comes in and changes the outlook of the male lead. A big problem is that I really do not think that Josh Hutchinson did a very good job. The supporting cast was great and Robert Patrick had a very hard job, but did it perfectly. He had just enough edge, but was caring enough that he felt like a real father (at least the ones I imagine). The soundtrack was really bad because I think it was aimed at a younger audience, but I think adults will relate with it more. I honestly loved the build up and how they did not go over the top with the special effects and built up the imaginary world gradually. I think I may have my kids watch it, but it is not a great movie. I will make a note of how bad the dubbing is and the only reason for that is Hutchinson cannot act and needed to redo a lot of his scenes, but whatever the reason that is some of the worst re-dubbing I have ever seen in a movie (it might have been something technical on my end, but I have not encountered the problem with any other movie).",Bridge to Terabithia

94,RCWjr,Not what I expected......,9,20 February 2007,"I was not familiar with the book. My sons had read it, but it was not part of the reading list when I attended school. That said, the ads really do a poor job of advertising what this movie is about. I don't know if they didn't have any faith in the story, but the fantasy element is overplayed on a large scale. The film contains pretty much the same minutes of effect shots that you see in the trailers, give or take 5 minutes.This movie is definitely NOT for children 7 and under, maybe even 10 and under. Not that the movie isn't for kids, but I think any child under 10 is totally going to miss the core themes of the story and be totally bored when elements of Terabithia are not on the screen. Beyond that, the story does take a DRAMATIC turn toward the serious side in the 3rd act and some kids under 10 may not be emotionally ready to handle it.OK, all of that said, this movie, though nothing like what I thought it would be, turned out to be a great film. Performances across the board were excellent, more specifically the two leads. The film deals with tween alienation in a real way. It could have been kiddied up but there are great pains taken to show the story elements good and bad, in an honest fashion.This should be a must read book and a must see movie for any young teen out there that feels a bit out of place. It deals with friendship in a very real and unflinching fashion. More importantly it deals with the pain of growing up in a world you don't feel like you fit into. It also deals with the pain of loss in a very classy yet unfiltered way. It doesn't try to water down the pain, but rather show how it can be focused into something good.",Bridge to Terabithia

It was a tearjerker for sure, and if you think about it too much after leaving the cinema - extremely bleak and depressing as well. Narnia this ain't! I would have given it a higher score, but I have to dock some points for the terribly underhanded and misleading marketing.

Nor am I being sarcastic. Bridge to Terabithia is truly a legitimate film to study in a college psychology course dealing with these issues. It shows the adults in the story trying their best to help the surviving child cope with an all too common tragedy - death by drowning of a friend.However, this film is overwhelming with grief. I have enough in my own personal life, as many of us do, that I don't need to pay to watch it on the big screen, too. I'm not asking for only mindless entertainment. But when out-of-the-blue, in the middle of the story, in what started off as a delightful fantasy - turns into a gloomy melodrama - then I have a problem reconciling my need for entertainment with the filmmaker's need to demoralize his or her audience! I also want to make it clear this movie is not appropriate for young children, unless you want to expose them to the tragedy of sudden death, and all its raw emotions.Its extremely rare that a film leaves me in such a sour mood. Perhaps it's because, as a young teen, a classmate of mine drowned since he did not know how to swim. A stupid way to die - to put it mildly. So if any lesson can be taken from this movie it is this: Make sure you teach your children how to swim - along with making them understand & respect the power of water!",Bridge to Terabithia
98,simonparker1990,A Bridge that Opens Up Your Mind,10,6 May 2007,"The focus at the moment is very much upon fantasy based novels. Anything remotely fantasy based is currently being snatched up by the big name studios in order for them to make a profit. After Lord of the Rings scored big, Chronicles of Narnia and Harry Potter scored lots of money as well, loads of novels rights have been bought. Currently in production we have the first in the His Dark Materials series, another series likely to make a large sum of money. So what about Bridge to Terabithia. Us folks in England have pretty much never heard of this book, but apparently it was extremely popular in America many years ago. My initial feelings towards Bridge to Terabithia is that it would be just another Narnia knock off. That was the way the trailers made it out to be, and every TV Spot I saw did the same. So what a surprise to say that this really is not that much of a fantasy film. It has fantasy elements in it, but there is actually little time spent in the magical land of Terabithia. Instead this is very much a drama, a drama about friendship and the power of imagination. Its only very rarely we get treated to the site of a magical creature in the make believe world of Terabithia, but those moments aren't the ones that stick in memory. Its the smaller, more powerful moments that really stick in the mind. Come the surprisingly tragic finale the focus of the movie has shifted, most of the audience I saw this with were reduced to tears. Its a powerful conclusion and one that makes this easily one of the best family movies I have ever seen.So lets first start with the actors of the movie. Child actors are usually pretty awful, Daniel Radcliffe, Edward Speleers, at times Haley Joel Osment and loads more. Most are one hit wonders and then disappear. Most are also eye gougingly annoying. So what a huge surprise to say that Josh Hutcherson and Anna Sophia Robb are two of the most talented young actors I have ever seen. They have a level of maturity and chemistry between them that makes them believable. Each character has their own flaws, and the actors play on them brilliantly. The scenes where they simply talk are memorable because these two actors really can act. They both have a bright and promising career ahead of them. The adult actors of course never get the time to breath because the focus is very much on the child actors. However Zooey Deschanel and Robert Patrick make the most of their brief screen time, making two very interesting and also believable characters.Its the movies story that really does stay in memory though. Its a simple tale about two children who become unlikely friends. The two then decided to create their own special place for themselves, and thus in their minds form the magical land of Terabithia. That's really it, well there is more in the final quarter of the movie but can't ruin that for you as the impact will softened. Its a simple tale and all the more effective for it, for a movie being passed off as a Narnia knock off it always seems a better movie. Surprising as this has no huge epic battle at the end to wow audiences, this is a movie purely about a friendship and its also one that you can't help but be moved by. This is easily one of the best family movies of all time, and despite it no doubt going to be ignored at the cinema, it will hopefully have a long life on DVD.So are there any faults then, well at times the CGI isn't amazing, thankfully the CGI is kept very low due to their being few times we actually see Terabithia. Also this isn't for people who go in a movie expecting huge battles, this is no Lord of the Rings or Narnia, this is something a lot different. While its not as good as Lord of the Rings it is a lot more impressive than Narnia. Apart from that I saw no faults, it has a great running time and superb performances. This is a movie that will undoubtedly feature in the top 10 of 2007 at the end of year. A great movie, a shame it will be shunned aside by the vastly inferior Spiderman 3 currently showing at the cinemas, but Terabithia is the much better movie and one that sticks in memory for a long time.",Bridge to Terabithia
99,etsm92,A fantastical fantasy,7,27 February 2007,"Bridge to Terabithia/2007/***Main Stars: Josh Hutcherson AnnaSophia Robb Zooey Deschanel Robert PatrickI read the book Bridge to Terabithia by Katherine Paterson in fifth grade. When I first heard that Bridge to Terabithia was going to be a movie in 2007, I was in fifth grade. I was fifth grade in the years 2003 and 2004. I am now in eighth grade in the year 2007, and the movie has just come out. I took them three years to make the movie? Perhaps they had just started the script when I was in fifth grade. But three years to make a movie still amazes me. The script is by David Patterson and co-written by Jeff Stockwell. David Paterson is the son of Katherine Paterson, the author of the book. You can tell. The film is directed by Gabor Csupo (pronounced ""Chew-po""), who was a big hit with creating the Nickelodeon series, ""Rugrats"", which I loved when I was a little kid and which (I admit it) I still like now (the first two movies now; not the show). The first two movies were clever and movie buffs would recognize a lot of scenes that somewhat satire famous films, like the introduction in Rugrats in Paris satires The Godfather, which was an excellent scene. The third ""Rugrats"" film was shrill and annoying. I decided to see Bridge to Terabithia for those two reasons: I read it in fifth grade, and Gabor Csupo's accomplishments impressed me. It turns out I liked it. If you saw the previews for the film, then you might think the film is filled with special effects. It's really not. The special effects are the most minor things in this film. The film concentrates more on the characters' creativity and imagination, which is a good thing. I truly would rather see a movie that shows more what humans are like and how they act rather than see a brainless adventure film, where the only adventure is seeing overwhelming special effects pop before your eyes. I seemed to have overrated Roland Emmerich's The Day After Tomorrow by a tad. That concentrated more on special effects than anything. However, I must add that it did have good acting. Then again, when I reviewed the film, I was an immature child. I've grown a little since the beginning of 2005. The main characters, Jesse Aarons (Josh Hutcherson) and Leslie Burke (AnnaSophia Robb), are the two that have similar, creative imaginations. They both get picked on at school and both daydream. As for Leslie, she seems a little more of the adventurous type than Jesse. However, Jesse seems to learn from her to be able to imagine the world of Terabithia. Jesse's father, Jack (Robert Patrick), is the type of father that is non-imaginative and a little rough around the edges. The mother, Nancy (Katrina Cerio), is the type of mother that is a worrier but she doesn't have as big of a part as Jack does. Jesse realizes his dad doesn't seem to understand his creative side, which we, as the audience, can realize too. Leslie's parents are completely different: they are full of happiness and adventure. They are both authors. That may show why Leslie is so creative. Then again, Jesse is creative and neither of his parents seems to have that disposition. So what does that show? It shows that Jesse is unique. And it shows that Leslie is also unique no matter how much she may resemble her parents. It still shows that everyone is slightly different from other people. That was one of the main themes I picked up from the film. Jesse has a crush on the music teacher, Ms. Edmonds (Zooey Deschanel), at his school, who recognizes his talent by taking a peek at his drawings. It just so happens she even takes him to a museum to look at more art painted by famous artists/painters. There is a bully at school who picks on Leslie a lot. Does she learn her mistake and move on no matter what happens at home? This is another main theme in the film. The bully also happens to show up as a different creature in the film which shows her new self. Jesse may think his life is bad but when we see it, his life is excellent and filled with different adventures all the way through. A tragic event happens in the film which lowers his happiness. But as for his imagination, it still blooms on as life goes on. And soon, he would gain joviality as his imagination blooms and he creates a whole new world inside his head.

100,MairegChernet,even my little cousins didn't like it.,3,14 March 2008,"this is a movie intended for kids. but that doesn't mean it should suck. i saw it on DVD and i was with three of my cousins, a 10 year old, an 8 year old, and a 6 year old. as the movie was over, i looked at their faces and there were looks of despair on all their faces, you are not alone i said to myself.this movie is nothing more than an overly hyped piece of work. the plot is about a boy and a girl finding an ordinary kingdom called Terabithia. the plot was amazingly weak, my little cousins could have written a better storyline than that. OK, i accepted the plot's weakness and let it roll, and then what happened was no plot buildup, the main characters Jess and Leslie (Anna Hutcherson and Annasophia Robb)kept going to terabithia and from there i thought it was going to take a narnia kind of turn, where characters have to battle an evil adversary and defeat it, don't expect this from terabithia, the main characters just keep visiting the kingdom, and before you know it the movie is over.storyline-wise superficial, acting-wise mediocre and overall weak and uninteresting movie. the only thing i didn't get is how this movie ended up getting a 7.4 user rating. 3/10",Bridge to Terabithia
101,boe_dye,This movie really angered me.,2,16 July 2007,"It wasn't the story that bothered me. It wasn't that the really likable cute anna sophia rob becomes a tragic character, at least not directly.What bothered me, a lot, was because the previews portrayed this movie as one thing, and turned out to be something totally different.I like many people had no idea that this was a book. I knew absolutely nothing about it except that the previews and trailers made it look like a quaint whimsical fantasy.So 2/3 into the movie, my wife and I, and my friend are kinda wondering what the hex was going one...I wouldn't have even seen it if I had known that it was going to be more about two friends who bond together and form an imaginary world together, then actually having a real adventure together.I'm not saying that it was a bad movie, I saying that I was mislead to what it was about.So we kinda cringed and bore it, and figured okay, this isn't the fantasy adventure that the previews made it out to be what is......wait a minute...You just randomly killed off the most likable person in the film...Wow talk about a downer...Quite honestly up till that point, I was tolerant of the film that advertised as one thing and turned out to be something else, but oh now it's a tragedy! At that point, anything else that happened afterwords really didn't matter to me cause I was just downright depressed...Not so much cause the cute little girl who was so spunky and full of life died, but because I had spent money to see a movie that advertised to be one thing, turned out to be something completely different, and then took it one step further...It would be like going to a Christian Bookstore and buying some seemingly good wholesome Veggie Tales cartoon, and when you put it in your DVD player, it turns out to be a snuff film of Bob the Tomato and Larry Cucumber being turned into a salad...I mean, I get the whole ""it's life"" argument. I get the whole tragic character type of story, and I get that people die. But in a movie that advertised as a fantasy movie that sort of seemed like it was going to be, in fantasy genre only not plot, Chronicles of Narnia, or Harry Potter, well it kinda lied to me.Now as a film all by itself all things aside? I really didn't like it. The acting wasn't bad, but there wasn't anything really special about it. Anna Sophia was insanely likable. She was so darn cute, and happy and bubbly. She is a great actress in her own right. I mean she went from being a stuck up b---- in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory to the cute little thing. I kinda wish that I had known someone that cool in my early childhood.To me, she was the only redeemable thing to this movie. Everyone else was rather stale, and typical.The story again, wasn't bad, but it was not great either. It would have been something had they actually went to Terebithia instead of imagined it. After all I can go to the land of make believe with Mr. Rogers.Even the randomness of killing off the girl just didn't seem right. It was like the whole intention of the movie after that was not to tell a cute little tripe of a story, but instead to bring up the viewer way up, only to cut them down to remind them about the realities of life.Okay, life sucks enough as it is, we really don't need to be reminded of that in film. But then people argued that the children need to learn that. That is fine, the children will learn it in the natural course of life. There is no reason that you should be the one to impress that upon them.The worst part was, that her death had no meaning. Even in tragedies a death has meaning. This death was empty and meaningless. There was no point to it. Again the argument ""well not all death in real life has meaning"". True, but this is a movie not real life. That's why we go to movies to get away from real life.You simply don't go to a movie to watch your life. You already know about your life and life in general. You want something that will tell you a story, that will give you hope, maybe make you sad, maybe make you laugh. whatever. but you don't see fiction pretending to be life.Well, enough foolosophy on this subject. My review is wrote, and that is about all I have to say on this....don't bother...",Bridge to Terabithia
102,eve_dolluk,Not what I was Expecting,6,25 March 2008,"Well I started to watch this with the idea that it was a children's fantasy film ( the main reason why i didn't go and watch it at the cinema ). It turns out that what i had seen on the trailer was not what i first thought. The fantasy sections are there but through the characters imagination's which is fine by me. I half enjoyed the film and half didn't.Good points :- tackles some serious issues for children, visually great, good performances from the 2 leads, some funny moments ( mainly from younger sister ), An emotional story.Bad Points :- Everything was glossed over too quickly. e.g. lead girl dies... 3mins later everyone smiles again. The funeral was so unemotional and the girls parents were just so wooden it was like eh !!. In fact all of the acting by the adults in this film was wooden apart from the teacher and she just looked stoned or vacant all the time, which may have been the case as she was a hippy music teacher.The same goes for the child abuse, apparently the girl was crying because kids found out she was being hit by her father and was now embarrassed at losing face. Surely she is upset a. because she was being hit or b. her dad may go to prison. The songs the kids were singing in class were just so Christian and sickly it just made you cringe. The Christian undertones were annoying and one scene dedicated itself to the whole hell concept. It was refreshing to hear the girl have her own opinion though rather than a brain washed one. That was another problem she looked to old she acted too old and she was too clever and wise for her age. It just didn't fit.A lot of this film didn't fit, I can imagine the book is really good but the film is a bit of a mess. Never the less if you do what the film does and just gloss over all the bad points then you can enjoy it for what it is.... although I am really not sure what audience this will appeal too, its not suitable for kids under 10 and its a bit young for adults. Girls will like it between the age of 10 and 20 and maybe some older young at heart people. I'm sure this could have been great but it in the end its just OK/good. I am probably going to read the book so i can get a better feel for the story.",Bridge to Terabithia
103,the-gossip-king,An adaption of one of my favorite novels,7,5 April 2008,"The story in this is superb and it follows the novel spectacularly well. All the scenes from the book were in here and there were added scenes that were just as good and if I hadn't read the book I would have believed they were in there. All the relationships are believable like Jesse and his father, Jesse and Leslie and Leslie and her parents. I am not embarrassed to say I am a guy and I cried my eyes out. When the character goes to a museum and leaves Leslie behind I sat there with my stomach churning. The acting in this movie was superb especially on the kids part but oh my god! Robert Patrick was so damn good as the father. He was so perfect for the role and he did it to absolute perfection as the tough, neglecting father of Jesse. The only thing I was disappointed in was the marketing campaign which even after I have watched the movie still has left me pretty peeved. I had the choice of going and seeing this at the movies but after I saw the trailer I was so put off it that I didn't because it was going to be unfaithful and a made up really cool fantasy adventure. I ended up watching it on DVD because I couldn't resist and I was amazed but I really wish I had seen this in the cinemas. It was really, really good!",Bridge to Terabithia
104,TheGOLDENWALRUS,Great movie about the power of imagination than BOOM! Tragedy strikes!,7,19 June 2007,"When I was a kid, I wanted the world to work the way I wanted it to work. I wanted the trees to talk back, war with imaginary villains, and fly with the birds. I really felt it and so did the main characters of the story.Let me start by saying AnnaSophia Robb did an excellent job in this movie. Her character was so warm and so lovable - even in the first few lines she has in the movie. She played Leslie where her family didn't have time for her (though it wasn't really shown much throughout the movie) as she moved in and meets the main character, Jesse, played pretty well by Josh Hutcherson. The chemistry between the two was very good as Jesse tried to avoid Leslie but knew she was the perfect friend as she saw things the same as he did. Josh's family also didn't seem to have time for Josh either (this was shown throughout the movie).The movie bounced back and fourth between the friends school life of bullying and their imaginary world where everything was perfect for them. Thw two loved each other more than anyone could love and didn't show it with a token kiss like most movies would. They were so happy together than tragedy strikes and completely breaks any viewers hearts.This movie should of been longer. 90 minutes seems to be the typical time for a movie but this movie should of been at least 15 minutes more. I wanted to see more of their world as it showed just a fair amount in my opinion (kind of like how Pan's Labyrith was - great great film by the way). Movies are marketed different now a days and some viewers may be disappointed. I saw this movie more as drama than an adventure.I never read the book but I'm hearing Disney kept it very similar to it. I like that a lot as I hear Eragon wasn't even close. This is the better fantasy film I've seen in years, I just wish they had more but still a movie to buy. A warning to the parents out there, the thematic elements are strong.7/10",Bridge to Terabithia
105,Minerva_Meybridge,Deceptive Marketing - Typical Disney Horrid Film,2,26 June 2007,"This film was My Girl with added CGI. When I bought it to watch, I thought I would be watching a film about two children brought into a fantasy world. But none of it made any sense. It was as though Jess and Leslie were both on LSD. It was marketed as a kid's movie, so it didn't have to make sense, I guess. But then they needlessly killed off Leslie for the simple sake of shock value, because there was no real story with Tarabithia. It was just a mean trick to play on any children watching. First we hear that anyone who doesn't believe in Jesus is going to hell. Leslie says she doesn't believe in Him, then she dies. Disney is like this and always has been. Steven Spielberg once commented that Disney movies used to terrify him as a child. But Disney pulls this all the time. The all time classic example is Old Yeller about the dog that saves its master from a wolf only to die from rabies as a result. Don't get me wrong. I love Pinocchio and Snow White and Dumbo, but that's where the romance ends. The problem is that Disney has become to children's entertainment what Playboy has become to the adult magazine world...outdated, unimaginative and passé. Their writers are mean-spirited, their plots shoddy and the overall quality second-rate. Bridge to Tarabithia is nothing like The Chronicles of Narnia that it pretended to be. It is a cruel movie that offers no resolution and a tawdry and ridiculous attempt at catharsis. Some will say that this is how the book was written, but then the book should have been deemed unfilmable. Thumbs down to Disney, which will probably make a fortune off this one, but Disney won't care. Mice don't have thumbs.",Bridge to Terabithia
106,cyclone259,The trailers did their job...,5,18 February 2007,"****CAUTION: SPOILERS AHEAD**** Like some other viewers have commented, I wasn't aware of the book before I saw the movie, namely because I grew up long after the book came out. That being said, I've enjoyed taking my daughter to see the Harry Potter series and never read that series either. It's possible that without prior knowledge, that one can go see how a film develops and not have to hope that it lives up to the book.In this case my daughter, a very bright and intelligent six year-old decided that this is one of the many movies she wanted to see this year. We'd seen the previews while watching other drudgery, like ""Flushed Away"" (which is what happens to your money after seeing that one). Anyway, the highly misleading trailers made it appear to be a fantasy, not dissimilar to the nuances and feel of ""The Chronicles of Narnia"". We didn't exactly know what to expect to be honest, but it was far from a fairytale.Let me tell you first, that I'm not a right-winger, conservative type who is afraid of the whole notion of ""what lies beyond"" or feels threatened about the way others view religion or belief systems. I know that there had to be parents in the audience cringing when the discussion of ""God"", ""Hell"" and ""Damnation"" started between the two lead characters. Within the films context, the dialog about religion was very relevant to the stories development, but there was nothing in the previews that reflected philosophical discussions about religious beliefs and especially the death of one of the major characters. The acting was well done and the emotions came across effectively. I have to blame the company who made the trailer responsible for completely misleading the casual viewer. Die-hard fans of the book hoped it would stay faithful to what they read, while the rest of us were going to see the fabulous, mystical world of Terabithia. Instead what we got was having to leave the theater attempting to explain concepts of God, The Devil and Death and Dying to little kids. The subject matter was appropriate for tweens and older, although because the acting was very convincing, it brought the whole mood from really high and cheerful to a near standstill of despair. I can't fault the kids in the film for doing their roles so well, I would've just liked to be prepared. Next time I'll do a bit more research before I lay down a big chunk of money.In the end, I would like to forewarn all parents of children under ten that unless they're more emotionally mature, you might want to watch this movie first before you let them see it.",Bridge to Terabithia

I didn't know what to expect.It's really about kids, for kids. Unfortunately one of the main characters dies about 3/4 of the way into the movie. It's very unexpected, and very sad and depressing.

Many have issued responses stating that viewers should do extensive research to determine if a film is appropriate for children or not. My disappointment had nothing to do with children. I thought I was in store for a light, upbeat fantasy film. Sure I could have done extensive research and learned the story before I went to see it but that would defeat the purpose of even going to a film. The bottom line is that Disneys ads were deceptive. There are so many self appointed film critics who, although they have never even stepped onto a movie set, think they are film experts.

109,jantoniou,"What a charming, wonderful film...",10,30 June 2007,"This film is an antidote to the stupifying eye candy of nearly every CGI animated ""animal film"" that has come out in the last 36 months. If I see another movie with CGI penguins, beavers, lions, and bears, I'm going to slit my wrists, oh my.Based on the beloved book (aren't all classic children's stories -- beloved?), this movie is actually surprisingly light on the CGI - a dash here, a dash there. Disney unfortunately overplays this in virtually all the trailers, because this is a thinking child's (and adult's, for that matter) story about real life and real things that happen to real kids, as the book is. The film doesn't mute this aspect much.The protoganist Jesse Arons is a loner and a daydreaming and talented artist. Beset at all sides by bullies, Jesse meets Leslie, a likeminded creative / artistic type whose parents are the antithesis of the modern parent, including Jesse's -- thoughtful writers who are far more involved with the life of the mind, a character trait they've assiduously drilled into their daughter's psyche. God forbid - they don't even have a television! Can you imagine? With Leslie's prompting, Jesse and her create a magical kingdom of their imagination, called Terabithia. Yes, they paint on some CGI to this world, but it's mostly about fleeting shadows, lights, and sounds.Most already know how the story ends, but it's carefully played and the director lingers on it just enough I think. Suffice it say that this movie is not about gooey CGI and solely about some fantastical world, as the trailers imply. It's really about being a kid, a real kid outside of hand-held video games, DVDs, plasma TVs, and 24/7 Internet access. Based on the author's son's real experience, this is about life and death and what really happens to the people you love.Because Walden Media was involved--and the author herself is one of those ""I'm a writer who's happens to be a Christian not a Christian writer"" types--there are some ""faith-based"" elements to it, but it's very lightly touched upon like their other productions like Winn-Dixie and Narnia. Being a conservative right-wing Christian whacko myself, I think they deal with the eternal subjects of life, death, heaven and hell very deftly, without affronting many sensibilities, except perhaps those most militant Atheists who don't want their children ever to hear the G-o-d word ever spoken of positively.",Bridge to Terabithia
110,98nurdinm-1,Bridge To Terabithia,8,28 May 2009,"Jess Aarons (Josh Hutcherson), an aspiring artist who is bullied at school and feels left out at home, meets and befriends new girl Leslie Burke (AnnaSophia Robb), who has a vivid imagination and is also bullied. The two of them escape into a world they create in the forest by their home, the mythical land of Terabithia; and through their journey they discover the strength they have together to fight life's daily battles, before life throws up the ultimate challenge...If anything, this film is proof to us all that you should never judge a film by its cover, or indeed its trailer; the trailer for this film suggested a wild, Narnia-esquire adventure with great CGI visuals, mythical creatures and an ancient quest and so forth and so forth.The truth is that the film is very different. There are CGI moments of breathtaking beauty, as the two children create Terabithia in their imagination from the simple elements of the forest around them, which cleverly mirror the challenges they are facing in their everyday lives; the giant troll for example turns out to have a face similar to the eighth-grade girl who bullies them both. This first two-thirds of the film is a wonderful celebration of how imagination can still form an escapism for children, and no doubt many children will have sympathised with both this and the idea of feeling like an outsider, not just at school but at home, as Josh finds with his family of four sisters, busy mother and gruff dad (a rather similar performance from Robert Patrick to his role in ""Walk The Line"").But in the last third of the film the whole tone changes with a tragic and dramatic twist that, if you haven't read the book before, will stun you. It shows how reality and the sometime unfairness of real life can shatter even the happiest moments of imagination. If you're quick to tear up at sentimentality then be prepared with tissues, and it's possible that some children will have to pause the DVD because it's too upsetting for them, so that they don't quite understand. It can't explain why life can be so cruel sometimes, but it can certainly be a useful aid for a parent or a teacher who is trying to help a child start to find answers.Some brilliant performances from Hutcherson and Robb, as well as Bailee Madison as Jess' little sister. Zooey Deschenal seems slightly wasted in her small role as the music teacher who Jess obviously has his first crush on, but apart from that the cast perform well together. All in all this was a much more enjoyable film than one would first expect it to be.8/10",Bridge to Terabithia
111,teejayniles2345,Makes little sense except to Book Aficianados,7,8 August 2007,"I borrowed this DVD from our Family Video outlet and was quite underwhelmed as far as other recent treatments of the same kind of set-up. After this production company (Walden) had succeeded in adapting C.S. Lewis' CHRONICLES_OF_NARNIA:LION_WITCH_WARDROBE, I presumed that this would be rather given the narrative framework of what's more like a look back at childhood with an adult narrator telling about the significant year from grade school (previously done in a classic way in the adaptation of TO_KILL_A_MOCKINGBIRD). My expectations of there being an anchor and solid correspondence with the book failed terribly. I had read the book 20 or so years ago; since many plot developments seem so scrambled and incomprehensible (key is the one where the main character has gone away for a day without parental permission) As well as the dearth of supervisory figures during the recess and lunch periods. The Studio's Budgeted money thrown at some of the special visual effects and animation should have been better allocated as a shift into a animation-graphic representation type presentation and not a blend of live-action and blue screen fantastic creatures that are essentially unexplained from the plot. All of you who love the book and who read and re-read it for imagination's sake - - go ahead and share good reviews here. As for me, though, I would send the adult audience out in search at your video outlet for PAN'S_LABRYINTH or the early 80's MY_GIRL with Macauley Calkin.

I wasn't disappointed at all, it indeed is brilliant also! I mention Pan's Labyrinth because I had the funny feeling they were similar. However Bridge to Terabithia was undeniably captivating also. Walt Disney and Walden Media didn't get wrong in remaking this film, and they did well. Jess (Josh Hutcherson) and Leslie (AnnaSophia Robb) had portrayed well their characters as lively, imaginative, simple children. Though I haven't read the book, many say that the imaginations Jess had, as depicted in the film were lesser. Thought of the effects and action would do well to make the film a lot better. But I always got into the story and not the special effects at all. I say Bridge of Terabithia is strong and firm in this manner. It was also truly a family film. Walt Disney had been always true to that. The only thing funny about the film is that it made me tears to the end when Leslie dies! I laughed about myself when I realized that. But I couldn't deny that it was that so good it made me jerked into tears. Very heartwarming, sweetly heartrending.",Bridge to Terabithia
113,Thunderbuck,"""Unexpected"" in all the right ways",9,16 September 2007,"As BRIDGE TO TERABITHIA begins, it looks pretty familiar. Bullied kid, overlooked in his family, with a stern, seemingly-uncaring father, about to see his life changed by the new girl in class...And, of course, we know that the bullies are going to receive a comeuppance, the dad will break down and show that he really DOES have a heart, and that the boy and his new friend will find some magical world through the power of imagination.Except here, it doesn't happen exactly the way we've come to expect, and I'm pleased to say that this is as original and mature a script I've seen for a supposed ""family"" film in some time, from the clever animation in the title sequence to its moving ending.The first clue that this is something a little better than the standard family fare is that the performances and the script both ring true; Josh Hutcherson's character of Jess is totally believable, seemingly lost in the shuffle both at home and at school. The only thing that makes him special, being the fastest runner in school, is taken away from him when he's beaten in a footrace by new girl Leslie (AnnaSophia Robb).Jess and Leslie soon find they share an important bond; they are both very creative. Jess is constantly sketching and illustrating, and Leslie writes marvellously. In an early sequence, Leslie reads a paragraph on scuba diving that is so evocative that we see the bubbles rising from her mouth. Neighbors, Jess and Leslie are soon spending time together after school in the forest, where they begin to construct their own fantastic land of creatures.The first thing I REALLY liked about this movie is where the writers drew the line between reality and Jess and Leslie's fantasy; this is something they do to have fun, and entertain themselves. Yes, they gain some strength and confidence from their friendship, but their fantasies don't solve all their problems for them, either. The CGI sequences were used to sell this film as a family-friendly fantasy, but in truth they could have made this movie completely without them.A major character dies in the course of the movie, and I was concerned that the wonderful, believable balance established up to that point would be sacrificed. In fact, this is where the movie really begins to shine.Yes, the bullies are dealt with, in part through the confidence that Jess and Leslie find through their friendship. Yes, the stern dad (in a great turn from Robert Patrick) shows his heart, but in a scene so understated and quick it would be easy to miss if it weren't so convincing and moving. Did the co-producer of the RUGRATS cartoon series really direct this? Wow.To call BRIDGE TO TERABITHIA a great family movie might be accurate, but damns it with faint praise; it's a great MOVIE, period. Like TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD or IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE, this movie transcends the ""family"" label to become worthwhile for nearly any audience.

Beside this, the tragedy is totally unnecessary and is out of the mood of the movie: you cannot mix tragedy and fantasy and comedy IN A MOVIE, even if it happens in real life.

115,JTurner82,Not just an escapist fantasy movie....,10,2 July 2007,"Fresh from the success of their terrific first installment from the CHRONICLES OF NARNIA series, Disney and Walden Media teamed up to deliver BRIDGE TO TERABITHIA, marketed as another fantasy film similar to LORD OF THE RINGS and NARNIA. It even features visual effects by the award-winning New Zealand team behind both of those films. But don't be misled by the marketing campaign--BRIDGE TO TERABITHIA is only partially a fantasy film. In other words, the ""magical"" elements make up merely about a fraction of its 96 minute running time.What BRIDGE TO TERABITHIA actually is, however, is something quite different. Based on a highly regarded children's book by Katharine Paterson (the script is co-written by the author's son), the movie is a contemporary family story about a young teenager, Jesse Aarons (Josh Hutcherson), having problems with both his financially restrained family and nasty school bullies. His sole talent is drawing, but what Jesse really wants is to be the fastest kid in his class, going so far to practice all summer long to the point where he wears out his shoes (he spends a majority of the movie wearing girls' sneakers).Jesse's world is turned upside-down when Leslie Burke (AnnaSophia Robb), a very pretty and imaginative youngster, steps into his life. At first, he is resentful about losing to her in a footrace, but before long, the two become close friends. Every day they set off to a forest where they fabricate an fantasy world called Terabithia; here they can escape from their harsh realities and experience imaginative adventures on their own. Simultaneously, they strike back at the school bullies, especially when one of them, who guards the girl's bathroom, robs from Jesse's showstealing and adorable little sister, May Belle (Bailee Madison).For the first hour, BRIDGE TO TERABITHIA is warm, gentle, old-fashioned Disney film-making with a touch of nostalgia. The school scenes brought back memories for some of my early days when I was being picked on at one of the schools I went to. There is a very amusing contrast between the two different teachers, the stern Mrs. Myers (Jen Wolfe), and the sprightly Miss Edmonds (Zooey Deschanel), whose pretty face and genial nature makes Jesse's heart throb. It's Jessie and Leslie's friendship, however, that make BRIDGE TO TERABITHIA. Both are very likable and appealing, especially Leslie (thanks mainly to a lively and charismatic performance by Robb), and their relationship is genuine and touching without being romantic or sexual. The scenes between them are lively and a joy to watch, mainly because both children are impeccably cast. The scenes where they imagine Terabithia is simultaneously thrilling (thanks to the typically spectacular visual effects by Weta Workshop) and a lot of fun. Meanwhile, little Madison gets many of the best lines and scenes as Jesse's sister, while Robert Patrick turns in a surprising performance as his pressured but ultimately softhearted father.But things take an unexpectedly devastating turn in the final thirty minutes when a horrible tragedy strikes. I won't reveal what it is (although fans of the book as well as other reviewers on here have already pointed it out), but you might want to consider having a box of Kleenexes during this part of the film. The finale is not a ""happily ever after"" fairy tale ending, but a semi-sad but hopeful ending. Not since POCAHONTAS or WILLIE THE OPERATIC WHALE has a Disney production featured a bittersweet ending, but BRIDGE TO TERABITHIA does this in a way that elevates the overall production into something more meaningful than what unsuspecting viewers may expect.Actually, the best way to describe BRIDGE TO TERABITHIA is like a mixture of the fantasy and magical elements of NARNIA, LORD OF THE RINGS (although as mentioned, these scenes are only a small part of the film), the close friendship themes from CHARLOTTE'S WEB, as well as a brief sibling misunderstanding reminiscent of Miyazaki's MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO. I never imagined that such a combination would be possible, but BRIDGE TO TERABITHIA proved me wrong. It is refreshing to see a movie as deep and meaningful as this, but for a Disney movie it is arguably one of the very best in years. Considering how mediocre their output has been (although NARNIA and PIRATES OF THE CARRIBBEAN have been happy exceptions), this is saying quite a lot.Don't cross this BRIDGE TO TERABITHIA expecting another roller-coaster/good vs. evil fantasy adventure; when all is said and done, chances are you'll find yourself moved. There are occasional flashes of special effects, of course, but at heart, it's a beautifully photographed, well directed, compellingly scripted, and strongly acted film that's not just a children's movie. Even adults are sure to be enchanted. This has become one of my favorite movies of all time, and I recommend it very highly.",Bridge to Terabithia
116,Batkid1,Honestly not what it's made out to be.,1,2 November 2007,"Seriously, this and ""The Departed"" are the most over-rated films of this year. Both have characters who the viewer doesn't really care about and are mainly 'style over substance.' Anyway, despite being a huge fan of Action/Adventure/SciFi/Fantasy franchises, this movie just bored me to death and I could never connect with the main characters at all. I don't know how true it is to the book source and could honestly care less seeming how I came to watch a movie, not read a classic book.Robert Patrick ( Terminator 2; Cop Land; Flags of our Fathers and T.V.'s ""Stargate: Atlantis"" and ""The Unit"" ) is really showing what hidden talent he possesses and just how under-rated he truly is by playing the bossy, but loving father. The main male protagonist I've never heard of/seen so it doesn't matter; Anna Sophia Robb isn't really showing what talent she has and her character dies pointlessly at the end as if the writers just randomly got bored with developing her and just decided to have her friend come home from school one day and find her dead in a creek. Why did they include that in there? I know this film is about life in general, but this film is never believable in the least. Did the author of the book have an awful child-hood and just decide that life is always depressing and that the only way you can have fun is to play pretend with your imaginary forest creatures?Don't get me wrong here, Imagination is an important thing to interact with seeming how life wouldn't really exist without it now would it? But to believe that this kid has such a lame life and that all he does is just pretend to interact with his ""creations"" is just not what makes an entertaining film. The creatures are seen in-between here and there, but aren't really seen until the end in their entirety. The movie's concept has just already been done before and the normal clichés follow in these kid movies ( bullies who constantly harass our protagonist and are really stupid, the parents that don't really pay attention to their kids and tell them to be quiet, etc.) and while I don't doubt that this doesn't happen in real life, it doesn't really make an entertaining film.Plus, Disney was dumb to even bother with producing it seeming how it's really depressing and not a ""real"" family film. Parents, rent a Disney cartoon or have a family discussion on life, in general, instead of wasting your money!",Bridge to Terabithia
117,windypoplar,perfect for the younger set,6,25 July 2008,"""Bridge to Terabithia"" based on Katherine Paterson's book, but updated for today's tweens, is a big-budget Walden Media, Disney picture that really please kids 8 and up. It's the story of Jess Aarons, a talented kid, he can draw, he can run like the wind, but he's bullied at school and his parents just don't get it. Jesse's life is changed forever when Leslie Burke enters his life. Leslie, played superbly by AnnaSophia Robb, is spunky, friendly and full of imagination. She leads him to Terabithia, a land of fantasy you swing across an ""enchanted"" rope to get there. Jesse is a bit apprehensive, but who could resit Leslie?The story is good, if it does move in fits and starts, apparently all daydreams end by dinner time here. The kids are good and well drawn and Zooey Deschanel is outstanding as the music teacher. This girl has the most amazing eyes I've ever seen! This Disney version was quite different from the Wonderworks special I remember, which had a lot more of Jesse's spiteful Mom in it. Still it works and Jesse's little Sister is a real doll.So why didn't this enchant me? Perhaps because we never really see that much of Terabithia, glimpses mostly and are we supposed to think you know who was the ""Dark Master""? There is a plot twist late that may upset some little viewers, but its very well handled and important to the story. Still I didn't fall for this the way I didn't fall for Walden's overrated and overheated ""Chronicles of Narnia-the lion, the witch and the wardrobe"" It's just too simplistic. If it wasn't for AnnaSohpia Robb's performance I'd feel I wasted my time. Even ""Flicka"", with Alison Lohman, flawed as that was, was better in some ways.All that said this is still quite good and should really please families. The magic just wasn't quite there for me, but it was a good movie to watch, weather you want to revisit time and again is up to you.",Bridge to Terabithia

120,twhiteson,Bland adaption of a truly moving book *SPOILERS*,6,17 April 2013,"Reading the other reviews here makes me wonder if anyone reads anymore. I'm surprised at how many of the reviews here appear to be written by persons who have never read the book upon which this movie is based.Backstory: In August 1974, 8 yr old Lisa Hill of Takoma Park, Maryland was on a beach vacation with her family when literally out of the blue a bolt of lightning struck and killed her. This unthinkable tragedy devastated both her family and her best friend, 8 yr old David Paterson, son of children's author Katherine Paterson. Haunted and inspired to make sense out of the sudden death of a little girl and her son's grief from that loss, Ms. Paterson penned what became her most famous and beloved book, ""Bridge to Terabithia. Published in 1977 and garnering almost universal praise, the book has a well-earned spot as a classic of modern children's fiction.David Paterson grew-up and determined that his mother's powerfully moving story of the joy and value of friendship and the fragility and wonder of life would make a good film. He finally succeeded as producer and screen-writer when Disney released this film in 2007.However, Disney clearly didn't know how to market this movie. The result was one of the most deceptive ad campaigns in recent memory, and it appears that six years after the film's release people are still being drawn by the false premise that it's a fantasy film similar to ""The Chronicles of Narnia."" It's not. Instead it's a contemporary story of a friendship between two young kids. Yes, these two friends imagine a magical kingdom for themselves over which they rule, Terebithia, but that's just a small part of the story.The actual story is about young Jess Aarons (Josh Hutcherson)the only boy in a financially struggling rural family. He views himself as a bit of misfit both at home and at school. He has no real friends and feels overlooked by his parents. All he has is a passion for drawing, a crush on his music teacher (Zooey Deschanel), and an overwhelming desire to be ""somebody"" by becoming the fastest kid in the school. After a summer of training, he's confident that he's got that title in the bag except on the first day of school a new kid (a girl!) beats him and every other boy. She's Leslie Burke (Anna-Sophia Robb), the only child of well-to-do writers and a courageous, imaginative free-spirit unlike anyone Jess has ever met.Despite this not so promising beginning, Jess and Leslie become inseparable friends. Together, they confront and defeat both real-life bullies and imaginary giants in their magical kingdom of Terebithia. They're true soul-mates. Yet, one day a tragic accident separates them forever and Jess must come to terms with that loss.Overall, this is an OK movie with decent performances and stays fairly true to Ms. Paterson's narrative. (Thankfully, it didn't get ""Disney-fied"" by gutting the story of its purpose.) However, it's bland and not particularly memorable. It contemporizes the story by setting it in an affluent-looking, early 21st century suburb. As a result, the film loses a lot of the book's color which came from it being set in an impoverished 1970's rural northern Virginia community. In the book, Jess and his family are very poor: for his family's milk he literally has to milk a cow and they use a wood burning cook-stove. Plus, it's a bit hard to swallow watching 21st century kids playing imaginary games in the woods in this age of Apple, Sony, and Microsoft especially when those kids are played by young teens Hutcherson and Robb instead of the 10 yr olds that Jess and Leslie are supposed to be. Additionally, Ms. Robb is too pretty and girly-looking to be a believable Leslie and the film reduces a lot of Leslie's ""sparkle"" to simply having her dress as some sort of Bohemian skate-rat.The biggest issue, though, is that the movie just doesn't pack the emotional wallop of Ms. Paterson's eloquent book. Sadly, David Paterson's screen-play could not match his mother's book in creating emotional depth and feeling for its characters.",Bridge to Terabithia
121,rachelgallit,A Rude Awakening,10,28 January 2020,"I think I speak for much of my peer group when I say that this movie marks the disillusionment about death for a generation. While the movie itself is average in execution and world building, it is the potent emotional impact that stays with one for years afterwards that makes this movie worth its weight in gold. Jessie and Leslie escape into a world of their own creation just 'across' the river from their town, and experience untold fantastic adventures of a classical nature. When Leslie attempt to reach their world, Terabithia, after a big rainstorm via the rope swing they usually use, she is caught by the water and drowns. This is a sudden and senseless death, and the lack of meaning to her death (nothing is gained or saved) is a raw experience that leaves an indelible mark on the viewer.",Bridge to Terabithia
122,srobi280,The trailer is more exciting and magical than the movie... and totally misleading,1,23 December 2007,"Two hippies on an acid trip in the woods? Oh, sorry, we're talking about Bridge to Terabithia. My girlfriend thought the movie would be filled with fantasy based on the preview. After she saw it, she told me how bad it was. I had to see for myself.The ""story"": So basically, junior has a very bad life. His parents don't pay enough attention to him, he hasn't got any friends, and your typical, stupid, walking-talking-cliché bullies keep picking on him. One day, a new girl moves into town. A bubbly little blonde named Leslie. They become friends, and eventually head into the woods. Here is where the magic begins... or so you are led to believe. Instead of going into a magical world, they PRETEND that regular objects are magical! Basically, the story continues as such. They find an old rope, and swing across a shallow stream, which brings them into ""Terabithia"". Do we actually SEE Terabithia? No.The story drags on and on, with NOTHING magical happening. Then, completely randomly, Leslie drowns in the shallow stream. Junior is extremely upset, and eventually ends up taking his little sister into ""Terabithia"" as a replacement, where we actually get to see Terabithia for the first time.... and then BOOM, the movie is over...The critique: If you want to see the magical fantasy parts of this film, watch the trailer. They are ALL in there. This movie offers viewers absolutely nothing except depression and self-pity. The very idea that this kid goes to a school where every single person is a bully or just mean-spirited is ridiculous. The kid's parents don't care about him, and then Leslie dies, making this entire movie even more of a complete downer. Then, to top it all off, they serve up a nice steaming bowl of religious guilt. Leslie tells junior's little sister she doesn't believe in the Bible, after which the little girl says something along the lines of ""if you don't believe it then god will damn you to hell!"" And lo and behold, Leslie later dies, leading to junior and dad talking about whether she's going to hell or not. DISGUSTING.In terms of acting, this movie was sub-par, especially on the part of the school kids. The only decent actors were AnnaSophia Robb, Josh Hutcherson, Robert Patrick, and Zooey Deschanel. So basically the main characters, who's good acting was severely offset by the dismal acting of everyone else. Character development was very poor too. We also get no explanation for ""Terabithia"". What is it? Where did it come from? Who lives there? Oh, that's right, ITS ALL IN THEIR HEAD.The fact that all the fantasy is make-believe is upsetting. People see movies like these because they want to see ""real"" fantasy, such as Harry Potter or Narnia. If you want make-believe fantasy, you can have that for free simply by using your own imagination. Don't be fooled by the trailer!",Bridge to Terabithia
123,dutchs-1,Close to Consumer Fraud,1,25 February 2007,"What's worse than spending an evening at a movie that was completely different than you'd been led to expect? Coming home and having your intelligence insulted by an IMDb reviewer who claimed that disappointed viewers hadn't ""researched"" the film well enough. I wonder if this reviewer would write it off as ""inadequate research"" if he found his car's odometer had been reset, the ""natural"" foods he'd bought were full of additives, or the house he'd bought was full of concealed termite damage.We've all seen movies where we've said all the good stuff is in the trailers. Never has it been so literally true as with this movie. Essentially all the visual wonder and fantasy is in the trailers. Beyond that, there literally is nothing else in the film. We all know trailers hype the best scenes of a film, but to put out trailers that mislead so completely borders on consumer fraud. Putting this film in the same class as ""Narnia"" is like calling ""Blood Diamond"" a musical comedy, or ""Bruce Almighty"" a psychological thriller.I first suspected trouble when Zooey Deschanel showed up as the music teacher in school. Not that I have any problems with Zooey Deschanel. Far from it. But when someone of her billing turns up on the real world side of a fantasy film, there are only two ways to go. Either she'll also be a character in the alternative universe, or there won't BE an alternative universe. The film goes the second route.The plot is a stock plot of bright imaginative nonconformists dealing with school bullies. There's also a plot line where Jess, the hero, has to deal with his loutish father, more or less copied verbatim from ""October Sky."" At one point the father tells his son ""You've got your head in the clouds."" Fat lot of good ""common sense"" has done the father. In prosperous farm country, he can't make ends meet with both a farm and a second job. Mebbe if he'd got hisself some of thet thar book l'arnin', he might just figure out that a ""farm"" has to be more than a greenhouse with a few tomato plants. The scene where the father consoles his son is a classic of what I call ""Nazi With A Puppy Dog"" cinema, an attempt to humanize an otherwise repulsive character by showing him in a tender moment. I'm sure Hitler loved his dog, too.This being a Disney film, we were at least spared all the adolescent sexual discovery clichés, although considering the other themes the film was developing, I half expected it at any moment.Considered as an adolescent coming of age film, it maybe rates a six. There are a few good moments. Leslie, the new girl in school, is marvelous, although I don't picture someone of her looks and personality being an outsider. One of the bullies has at least a bit of a character transformation. (Nice touch: compare the bully's face with the troll in the fantasy) Considered as a fantasy film full of visual wonder, it rates a zero. It just isn't that kind of film and promoting it that way is little short of criminal.By trying to be two wildly different things, the movie fails to be either. As a film about two kids coping with bullies and retreating to a secret fantasy world, it might have come out a bit like ""Secret Garden."" And of course it could have been a full blown fantasy adventure. But by jerking back and forth from one mode to the other, it shortchanges both story lines.",Bridge to Terabithia
124,RyanEberhart,Awesome!,9,23 July 2013,"Bridge to Terabithia, what can I say about this movie? Watching it I was filled with a mix of emotions, from happiness when Jesse was able to make a new friend, to sadness when his friend died. I was also proud of Jesse when he finally stood up for himself to his dad and to the bullies that were harassing him. When Jesse included his little sister in the secret that is Terabithia I was again proud of him because it allowed the imaginary world that he and his friend created to carry on.Bridge to Terabithia begins with students returning to school after summer vacation. Jesse has been training all summer to win a race against two of his tormentors. When the race is set to begin a new student, a girl named Leslie, joins the line for the race. Jesse does well in the race beating his tormentors, however, he comes in second to Leslie.Despite the loss of the foot race to Leslie, Jesse and Leslie become friends. Leslie helps Jesse to unlock his imagination and they create an imaginary world called Terabithia. The entrance to Terabithia is an old rope they use to swing across a creek. Here they create their own little world.As time goes by they have many adventures. They slay a giant troll, based on another bully, by tickling it's feet. They fight off many imaginary enemy soldiers.They have fun until tragedy strikes and Leslie dies while trying to get across the creek. With this loss, probably the first in Jesse's life, he learns a hard life lesson.After this tragedy Jesse begins to stand up for himself more. He begins to include his little sister in Terabithia in hopes of passing the torch one day.I give this movie an 9 on a scale of 10.

126,Astralan,A good but sanitized script,7,20 February 2007,"I found it odd that Walden Media didn't put out more publicity on this. It appears that the book is quite popular. I only recently downloaded the audio book and started listening to it on my way to and from work when it suddenly popped up in the theaters. Seeing Monday is the only full day with my wife, we decided against seeing Ghost Rider and opted to see Terabithia on the big screen (along with a couple beers and some pretty damn good popcorn).My overall impression? This was one peculiar film and story with an ending even more perplexing. Listening to the story, you feel a level of dirt in the Aarons family that just didn't feel present in the film version. Disney and Walden Media seems to have sanitized the film; It was just a little too clean for my liking. OK, the target audience is for kids, and maybe they were making a fashion or hygiene statement. I also, within the first few chapters of the audio books got the feeling that some of the characters weren't nearly as ""tolerant"" as the development of the characters in the movie. I remember reading The Pond and Rascal when I was young. These types of books were not clean. There was a certain amount of acceptable behavior and ambiance that even a kid of 6 could find not only believable, but would consider it an excuse to go roll around in the mud. That in its self put me in a more critical frame of mind for this movie. Sorry. I think kids get way too much candy these days. It is just not reality.However, the story has it's moment. I don't think you could pick a more photogenic pair of kids than AnnaSophia Robb or Josh Hutcherson, and they were well paired for this movie. I seemed that peripheral story of the Aaron family had a back seat, as did the stories involving school. The primary focus was on a young girl (AnnaSophias' Leslie) who had her life downgraded because of parental decision to move, and the life of the boy she lived next door to (Josh Hutchersons' Jesse). Through various situations, Jesse befriends Leslie who eventually unlocks his inspirational sources and sets his artistic mind free.The use of CGI is somewhat limited, which in a way is kinda refreshing. It allows for more character development (even tho it seemed a tad weak). Graphically beautiful and shot in lush wooded country, there was plenty of room for the imagination of a child to be liberated. The closest thing to a spoiler I'm going to get to is that disaster strikes the heart of this boy 7/8ths of the movie, which was another point I needed to make: I should have felt more impact, but it just seems to pass by... and even though this disaster culminates in honor, the honor is a little sideways than dead center. That is only my opinion, as is all other reviews I have done here.The Bridge To Terabithia is a worthy watch. Not quite full price, but definitely a big screen event during a matinée. It has charm. It has some charisma. Most importantly, it has imagination, and a simple story that is fairly easy to follow: Rural boy meets new neighbor girl, forms a relationship that inspires him to overcome his reticence about pursuing his imagination and artistic abilities. For kids, this is a good thumbs up, but for adults, I remain ... -Astralan",Bridge to Terabithia
127,joliefille411,What planet do the trailer people come from?,9,13 April 2008,"Josh Hutcherson and Anna Sophia Robb star as Jesse Aarons and Leslie Burke in ""Bridge to Terabithia,"" directed by Gabor Csupo. You may recognize Miss Robb as Violet from Tim Burton's quirky ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,"" though you see more of her face here sans the trademark bubblegum. This is yet another screen adaptation of a popular children's novel to be produced by the partnering of the Walt Disney Company and Walden Media, who earned acclaim for the previous year's ""The Chronicle's of Narnia.""Jesse and Leslie are outcasts in their small-town school who find little refuge in their homes. The two form an unlikely friendship as they band together against the helplessness they face in reality and create an enchanted world that only they have the power to rule. It is the lessons they learn in friendship and imagination that help them deal with the inevitable tragedies of life.I must admit that after seeing the trailers, I did not expect much from this film. Having read the book by Katherine Paterson when I was younger, I was disappointed to see the story being marketed as a rip-off of Walden Media's earlier success, ""The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe."" Thankfully, the teasers turned out to be largely deceiving.Instead of yet another episode of run away to Neverland, the movie drew the audience into the very real, bittersweet lives of two children. The fantasy kingdom was clearly a product of their imagination and was kept from taking over the stronger points of the movie. Keeping the effects as far in the background as possible was a wise decision.The story never was about slaying giants or flying with dragons, so the decision to spin all advertisements that way is puzzling. It seems companies are convinced that Americans believe any movie that doesn't require a city full of special effects technicians to run it is no longer worth the effort to see it. But as recently proved with ""Eragon,"" dazzling effects cannot make up for a poor story. Poor acting is also a danger, especially when the weight of the movie rests on inexperienced actors. Hutcherson and Robb may be young, but they handle their roles with an earnestness and maturity that half of Hollywood could not pull off convincingly. Especially in the scenes between Jesse and his father, watching the boy's face convinced me that he actually felt those deep emotions without having to say a word. It's hard to believe he was only 14 years old.Despite being largely marketed to younger audiences, the film was intelligently crafted and refreshingly free of cheap laughs. The recent trend in animation companies for spitting out movies with little substance and less tact has been annoying to say the least. It's nice that at least one person at Disney has enough sense and respect for the audience to go choose an insightful and moving storyline over the 100th chorus of belches and giggles. ""Bridge to Terabithia"" proves that we don't have to watch a gag every minute to have a solidly entertaining experience.",Bridge to Terabithia
128,Jinn,~ As I cross the Bridge to Terabithia ~,10,9 December 2007,"I am enthralled ...When I saw the trailer, I was expecting a fantasy movie. (I had not read the book at that time). At first it seemed to take a while to get into. However as the movie progressed, I moved a long with it. I am glad it wasn't some Narnia or other fantasy rip off, where kids, or somehow get transported to a magical land and have to fight some 2 dimensional bad guy to free the people and the land from evil oppression or some unlikely hero comes along and has to, against all odds has to save the world, or even Galaxy. As much as I adore Harry Potter, Buffy Summers, Frodo Baggins, Luke Skywalker, and their uniqueness, ripping off characters and established genres is not unique. I have seen many fantasies and sci-fi, some wonderful, like Narnia - and I mentioned The Lord of the Rings, Star Wars and Harry Potter, and others I've seen, B-Grade, cheap, predictable and downright awful. I watched Terabithia with my mother and we both adored it. When I returned the DVD to the video shop, the assistant said he loved it too and was pleasantly surprised it wasn't your ordinary, average fantasy. Many of my friends saw the movie before I did and adored it. One took her children to see it and told me, without spoiling it for me that it was wonderful, awakening and enlightening.The movie is about imagination. Perhaps the trailer should have shown more of this rather than just the fantasy bits, which was misleading. I can see the movie has been panned by some who were expecting some special-effect, CGI creature laden epic. No imagination, there. Missed the part about keeping your *mind* wide open, obviously.The movie showed two children, treated badly at school because they were different .... Like I was. Through their awesome power of imagination, they created Terabithia. Each time, something new, exciting some things frightening. Using their own imagination to create their own magical world, rather than brainwashed by mainstream advertising, spending hours on end playing computer games, or thinking they're cool flashing their ipods. It showed that even bullies have a hard time - as many bullies are bullied themselves. It showed Jesse making friends with Janice, the school bully. And did it escape people's notice the friendly troll that helped them looked like Janice? The movie showed reality intertwined beautifully with fantasy, as two children brought beauty, freedom and magic to their world and made Terabithia as real as they wanted it to be. Many people do not realise how powerful imagination can be.AnnaSophia Robb as Leslie was fantastic. They could not have chosen a better person for the role. She brought so much beauty and uniqueness to the film. Her expression, her love and passion for life. Leslie was truly special. I was shocked and saddened by her death in the movie and then I came to understand - some people come here (to Earth) for a short time to enhance our lives and the life of this world. Death is never an end, but a new beginning. A soul does not die and although we miss the physical person, and it is hard for people on Earth to understand this, the spirits of loved ones who pass on do not leave us as they journey to the Afterlife. Whatever you call it - Heaven, the Elysian Fields, the Summerland, it is a place of eternal life, peace and harmony. I was heartened that even though Jesse's family were Christian, they did not try to convert Leslie and her family, and Jesse's father told him that Leslie's spirit would go to Heaven. Or perhaps Leslie actually went to a free Terabithia. Perhaps her parents, both writers, could write her story. Perhaps Jesse could illustrate it so others can share in Jesse's beauty and her unique magic, teaching others to find their own unique expression.It is sad to see some parents pan this movie. I have known very young children who have had loved ones die and children should be taught about death, and that it is not as final as it seems. That a soul is eternal, and even though it is sad to lose someone, their beauty that enhanced you, the world and the Universe will never be lost as we too are on our scared journeys, touching others as we travel along our chosen paths.As I walk through the forest, along the leaf carpeted path, I hear the trees whisper my name. I cross the bridge to Terabithia. Come with me. See the castle, the lake, the ocean, see the entire kingdom and the now free people ... freed from the Dark Master. See the Dark Master realise the error of his former ways and cry and beg forgiveness. See the people forgive him and eventually make him King. He is now the Light Master and he rules the land in kindness. And this very handsome, once evil, King makes you his Queen. Together you rule Terabithia in love and peace.Keep your mind and heart wide open. With imagination, Create and be free.",Bridge to Terabithia

Basically a boy and a girl become friends and wander off into a magical world of their own. When not in their magical forest, they face the typical problems that any kids face growing up. Although I liked this movie as an adult, there is one sad portion which I wouldn't want kids to see. It was cool seeing it in the theater, but I don't think it really adds to the viewing experience. It's worth buying, so you might want to just wait for the DVD. Great movie.Defiant1",Bridge to Terabithia
130,bharath-karthikeyan,Disney's illogical Magic...!!!,9,30 July 2008,"The bridge to terabithia is one movie which the entire family could sit and enjoy watching it. Its about friendship,thrills,dreams,CON less mind,the innocence,and other wonderful points of view of two kids who become neighbors in their middle grades of schooling.One is a rich girl and the other a poor farm boy's son.But both of them are harmless and don't believe in Bullying their school mates. The character of the girl is brilliantly played and characterized and is gonna be one of my favourite characters played ever in Hollywood. The girl represents the dreamy world of the early teens and the underwater poem she presents in her class is really short and sweet. In the evenings after school its only up to the 2 of them to get entertained and so is how the magical world of terabithia evolves. The movie takes us to the magical world of terabithia.The beauty of terabithia is it appears DIFFERENT to every individual. But for two kids,it is all the same and it is upto them being the king and the queen to protect and rule terabithia wisely.Will they save terabithia and rule forever,or die doing it??? Will the world believe in the existence of terabithia??? What brings the balance between the magical world of terabithia and the real world??? Watch this simple but magnificent movie to find out the answers and you can be sure to be entertained.Both children and adults would find this movie entertaining. Even though the movie dint top the charts or win any big acclaims,it easily could be one shiny shield in Disney's trophy panel! A 9 out of 10. Tres bien...!!!",Bridge to Terabithia
131,georgevader,A children's film that treats them like adults,8,18 July 2007,"Joss Hutcherson plays Jess, a lonely bullied kid who befriends the school newbie Leslie (the superb AnnaSophia Robb), together they invent an imaginary world, Terabithia, which they explore to escape the drab mediocrity of their school and in Jess' case home lives.I have to admit I was expecting something along the lines of ""The Lion, The Witch And The Wardrobe"", but I couldn't be more wrong.The film is set in small town in modern day America, Joss' parents show very little love or affection to him, something he becomes more aware of when at Leslie's house when they 'help' paint a room.The film also deals with very adult themes, that as a child bad things can happen, you can lose people you love and care for.The two leads are excellent, and for two actors barely in their teens they should have promising careers ahead of them, my only criticism is that I wish Zooey Deshanel would put a few pounds on, she does look a bit skinny nowadays! 8.5/10",Bridge to Terabithia
132,rddj05,Disney Needs to Find a New Acting School for These Little Ones,3,16 October 2009,"In general, it's hard to judge a Disney movie or TV series on it's level of honest acting or realistic situations, since both are almost always atrociously abused. Whatever acting school Disney is sending these kids through, they really need to stop; immediately. One would never confuse the polished, mugging, child actors in this film with real children. The story is simply enough. Two put- upon misfits, who are picked on in school, team up in their after-school hours to create a fantasy life in the woods surrounding their homes. This make-believe world provides a refuge from the daily abuse they must endure at school and (for the boy), at home. This fantasy world is chock full of completely unrealistic CG effects, and one particularly bad scene has the two characters running in front of a laughably bad green screen effect. A tacked on sentimental ending, which appears to come from nowhere, and with an uncertain moral plummets the last 20 minutes of the film into bizarre territory. Not quite sure what the moral of the story is supposed to be. I suppose young boys should be wary of developing a crush one of their teachers, since it could lead to a completely unrelated tragedy which will haunt them for the rest of your life.The film has a bunch of story lines that are disjointed and never fully developed. However, it does get 3 stars for one scene that mildly attempts to criticize the absurdity of fundamentalist Christianity. Now, keep in mind, this is a Disney film, so it's not too controversial.Anyone who wants to watch sweet films about real children would be better off renting the Majid Majidi classics, ""Children of Heaven"" and ""The Color of Paradise."" Absolutely beautiful and, best of all, the emotion you feel at the end of both those films is completely earned.",Bridge to Terabithia
133,tobydale,A surprisingly poor Disney children's film.,4,23 July 2011,"Some years ago I saw a rather attractive trailer for this film. I have finally just watched it and I was very disappointed.My 8 year old sat with me and at the end he said, ""that film was rubbish""!A BIG BIG BIG problem in this film is that one of the central characters dies. Unbelievable for a Disney children's film. Unheard of. Really shocking in the context of what was still a rather slow and turgid piece.Bridge to Terabitha starts slow and sets the backdrop of a poor country boy with an active imagination who gets bullied a little. His life is not easy - but it is definitely not hard or tough. His parents and elder sisters are distracted and pay him little attention. The boy is a fine artist with a rich creative streak. A new girl comes to class at his school. She is charming, bright and has an even richer imaginary life - her parents are writers. She has no problems of any kind except that she is new to school.These two form a partnership which brings the imaginary world of ""Terabithia"" to life. Unfortunately - Terabithia and its creatures are only really hinted at. The film does not get going. The story talks about Terabithia and that's all. There is no quest, no adventure, no challenge - all could have been possibilities in this imaginary land. But no, the film doesn't go that way. Not at all. It continues slow, slow, trying and failing to build character, reason and flow. Then there is the COMPLETELY shocking death - which absolutely comes out of nowhere. It is also a pointless death, which adds nothing whatsoever to the story or to the development of the characters present.This film either passed completely over my head, or is very poor. It is NOT about loss & separation, NOT about characters who grow through a real or imaginary challenge, NOT about growing up. It is a vacuous piece which is NOT about anything.The ""Bridge"" to Terabithia comes right at the end of the film. My son picked out that it was really a bridge into the imagination - but that's all he picked out. It certainly isn't the point of the film, which I am still struggling with.I am amazed that Disney made this film - a film that so singularly and utterly misses it's target audience and instead treats them to the death of one of the two central characters.Watch this film only if you want to see how to completely miss opportunities. Definitely don't watch this film with children aged 4-13.",Bridge to Terabithia

Insects is all I have to say seem to be a distraction especially to me in this movie. The Computer graphics are really well thought out in this film as well as the actor and actress.

135,tollini,Truly Moving Picture,10,24 January 2007,"I saw this film on January 23rd, 2007 in Indianapolis. I am one of the judges for the Heartland Film Festival's Truly Moving Picture Award. A Truly Moving Picture ""explores the human journey by artistically expressing hope and respect for the positive values of life."" Heartland gave that award to this film.This is a story of a poor 10-year old boy who wants to be the fastest boy in his class at school. To his surprise, the new girl who moves in next door to him beats him out fair and square and wins the race. This is no way to start a relationship or friendship.However, they have something in common. They are both being bullied at school. And they each react differently. The boy, Jesse, is passive and tries to stay out of harm's way. The girl, Leslie, is aggressive and challenges her tormentors. Who knows what the right way is to fight bullying, but they find their defense in friendship with each other. And, they find a wonderful way to experience this trying time in life via their vivid imagination and the creation of a magical and enchanting kingdom that is very real to them.They are both creative people. He is an artist and she is a writer. These creative people are able to close their eyes, picture another world, and keep their minds open to fantastic visions.But the bullying persists and they attempt to come to grips with their pain in various ways. They try to out smart their tormentors and do, but they don't enjoy being bullies and becoming like their enemies. This story is based on a Newbery-winning novel. It is a child's story. But, it is also a story for adults. It will bring you emotionally to your knees. It is lovingly and professionally told, and the fantasy part of the story  the magical kingdom  is wonderfully and briefly shown on the screen. This keeps the story grounded and believable.Jesse and Leslie are beautiful people regardless of their ages. They show us how to enjoy life, how to do the right things, how to be faithful to one's friends, and have hope for the future. We learn a lot from these ten year old children.

136,ghettodogaudio06,Awesome Movie!,10,7 March 2008,"This movie was another movie that made me cry. I love fantasy films like The Neverending Story, Krull, Willow, Labyrinth etc... This nice little film was a Walt Disney piece that was fantastic as all Disney films are. I really related to the location set in this small country town. The main characters are Jess the Farm boy who's family is kind of poor. All the kids pick on him. Then a new family moves next door to him. They have a daughter named Leslie who is a New Age hippie like her parents. Her parents are authors who write fiction books. She is very intelligent and imaginative. Jess the boy is also very artistic and is good at painting. I loved the idea that Teribithia is across the canal if you swing across the rope. The other side is filled with magical creatures and a world only you could imagine visually on LSD. I am going to spoil the ending now... The ending is very sad and I cried when Leslie dies. She tried to swing across the water and hit her head and drown. This story is very realistic and imaginative. I remember when I was a kid and used to play in the country. I was fortunate to be brought up in a place of natural beauty and countryside. I loved the rolling hills and open pastures in this movie. The wooden fences you see in countryside and more old fashioned houses. This film was beautifully shot. Had a great script. The directing and acting was great. The production was impressive and I was not let down. This film was better then I anticipated and gets a score of ten.",Bridge to Terabithia
137,MeloDee,Magical.,8,28 July 2007,"I'll have to admit that although I had always wanted to see the movie, my expectations for it were pretty low. At best, I expected a mediocre film with below average acting and over-emphasized computer effects. At worst, the movie would be a blatant and tasteless attempt by Walden Media to ride on the fame generated by its popular film, the Chronicles of Narnia.A comparison between the two movies was inevitable. I am here to say that there is no need for this comparison, because Bridge to Terabithia can stand on its own.During the first forty or so minutes of the movie, I can recall being mildly charmed, amused, and nostalgic, but nothing more. The children were too ""old"" to play pretend and so I only felt myself being mildly involved in their goings on.But after a while, I wasn't mildly involved anymore. I was in there.The storyline is pretty simple. The star of our tale is Jess Aarons, who lives in the country with his parents and four sisters (two older and two younger). His father (Terminator 2's Robert Patrick) is a mechanic, who also grows vegetables in their greenhouse and raises some pigs. The family is obviously struggling to make ends meet. In the meantime, Jess, the only boy in the house, feels ignored by his parents- especially his father, who doesn't seem to take him seriously as an artist. In the meantime, Jess doesn't realize he is also ignoring his younger sister Maybelle, who idolizes him.Jess ends up befriending his new neighbor, Leslie Burke. Their worlds are completely opposite. She's the only-child of higher middle-class, artistically inclined and nonreligious parents. The one thing that they do have in common is that they are both outcasts of sorts at their school. That, and of course, Terabithia.One of the things that makes this story great, is the fact that although it focuses on their adventures in the imaginary world of Terabithia, it doesn't totally detract our attention from their lives as they are. It completely bypasses all stereotypical Disney humor and drama and has a firm setting in reality. We may not get along perfectly with out siblings, but we don't call them ""birdbrain"" every day at the kitchen table. Revenge on the school bully doesn't always have to mean tripping them in one way or another and landing them in a pile of the ""mystery"" casserole served at lunch. The students at school don't actually all look like they've been attended to by a professional stylist. More often than not, the barriers separating parent and child are vague, unspoken, unrealized. But very real.Perhaps this is a side effect of the story not actually being written by the average Disney writer. The story was a book written by a lady who didn't feel the need to either sugarcoat it or paint it black.Credit must also be paid to the cinematographers and director who helped make this film's unique environment a reality. The camera angles were magnificent. As for the 3D- it looks very purposely surreal, probably to emphasize the fact that Terabithia is imaginary. Yet it still blends well enough to be impressively beautiful. Perfect.Then there are the two stars who helped to meld it all together. Josh Hutcherson was 50% of the reason why I thought that the movie would fail. He seemed too stiff. As the film went on, I saw that this initial stiffness was a part of the character- communicating the coldness of a boy who felt isolated and under-appreciated, and didn't really appreciate himself.Hardly anyone could've been more suited for the role of Leslie than AnnaSophia Robb. Everything about her- gestures, pose, energy, smile, and even her voice- made her such a perfect Leslie. She lit up every scene that she was in.We can't go on without mentioning Bailee Madison, who played the role of Jess's younger sister, Maybelle. Bailee's performance was extremely natural and realistic. I doubt that this is the last we will see of her.The movie doesn't really blow you away. It's a lot more subtle than that. What it does do is make you feel something- and will definitely leave a lasting impression. In this movie, the magic doesn't come from a boy's wand or a little girl's wardrobe. With this, your imagination is the key.So close your eyes, and leave your mind wide open.",Bridge to Terabithia

The trailer has a lot of ""The Chronicles of Narnia"" feel, but the 90 seconds you see in the trailer contain slightly over two-third of all the fantasy elements in Bridge to Terabithia (the other one-third is in the ending part).Unlike the trailer suggests, this is a movie about two children (a boy called Jess and a girl called Leslie) who do not really fit into their school and who befriend each other. The boy has an additional problem in being treated badly by his poor parents. They think up a country (Terabithia) and fantasize about the inhabitants. This is where the few fantasy moments occur. They learn lessons from their fantasy play which they apply successfully in the real school world.The movie itself is quite touching and the actors play well. I could recommend this movie to anyone who likes a children's' drama movie, but especially Not to lover of ""pure"" fantasy movies.

142,jimmylee-1,Beautiful and Charming - No Magic Necessary,8,11 March 2008,"I've never read the book, and I'm home sick, so I thought I would finally just watch this imitation Narnia story now that it's on the premium channel - after all, I thought if it's too predictable or stupid, I could just sleep.Well, the marketing for this movie was just silly, because the story was about as far afield from two kids in a mystical land (which was the marketing theme) as you could get. Instead, it's about two sensitive children who, like most of us at one time or another, are trying to find a place to fit in. In the course of finding each other, they create a very special place that can exist in the heart for as long as it is wanted.There are many differences between the two children - Jess, the local boy, is a farmer's child. His stern father doesn't understand the artistic boy who can't do his chores well and doesn't acknowledge the hard life they lead - and so he points out Jess's flaws as often as fatherly hugs are given to Jess's youngest sister Maybelle. Leslie moves schools a lot, dresses differently, is small, has a vivid imagination, and does well at school. Neither are high in the school pecking order. But Leslie manages to wedge her way into Jess's closely-guarded affections and he suddenly realizes he has a friend.The heartache in this story was dealt with in an authentic (and gut-wrenching) way, cutting a swathe of pain across what had been a story about growing and learning. (I already had Leslie and Jess fighting about staying best friends versus becoming boy/girl friend and finally going to the senior prom together.) And it leaves a message of hope with Jess and Maybelle, with comfort from Jess's dad, and new alliances at school.I don't believe that the best stories have sorrow in them, but I do believe the best stories have moments that recall memories of our own. I can see why the book was so popular; the movie has something that touches everyone. I didn't need to see Terabithia - the story of Leslie and Jess was so beautiful.",Bridge to Terabithia

It is not what you expect and not what you want. With a wonderful cast the script is miserable at best. If you want a movie that makes you walk away feeling wonderful I would suggest ""Eragon"" but not this. I give this movie 3 thumbs down for being a complete and total downer.

However, the movie was slightly different from what i expected, and all the better for it. This is a movie which will strike a chord with anyone wistfully longing for a return to the pure innocence of their childhood, when opportunities and the power of the mind seemed limitless, and friendships so amazingly pure and simple.The story follows a boy from a struggling farming family, Jess, and how he befriends a new girl at school, Leslie. Leslie is a free spirited, adventure loving girl, who causes Jess to open up himself, and see the true joys of living life. Jess' greatest love is art. Together, these two create their own magical land, and escape there every day after school. Robert Patrick also plays a good turn as Jess' father, who struggles to make ends meet for his family.While it does get melancholy towards the end (unexpectedly), it does strike a chord within you, and you genuinely feel for the characters involved. This movie is definitely a must for those wanting a simple and wondrous look back at the glorious days of childhood.",Bridge to Terabithia

Although AnnaSophia Robb didn't look like the Leslie described in the book with hair shorter than a boy's and wearing boy clothes, she still did an excellent job in acting like an outgoing girl that was happy with life. And, although the previews just showed what the special effects were, the special effects only took about five minutes during the entire movie, and it's mostly about Jess and Leslie talking about how they think the creatures look like, and not showing. I also thought that Bailee Madison, who plays May Belle, was very cute for a little girl, and I thought that Josh Hutcherson, who plays Jess, was very good looking. But even though this movie wasn't what I expected, it still isn't a lot like the book, but the way the movie was put together was wonderful.

146,Listen_to_the_Law,Good-hearted and surprisingly emotional Movie,7,15 April 2007,"Bridge to Terabithia, an adventure/fantasy romp, is a strange movie with many different elements to it. It is shockingly emotional for a PG-rated movie, and has more depth and dedication than you're typical kiddy movie. One thing that stands out right away is the stellar cast, which is mostly made up of kids. Words cannot describe how many horrible kid actors/actresses I have had to paste my eyes on. It's so very refreshing to see kids who actually have talent. Besides that, there are also many parts that make up Bridge to Terabithia that make it a solid recommendation.The story revolves around a farm boy named Jess (Hutcherson) who gets picked on in school but, of course, has a big heart. Luckily for him, a new girl movies into school named Leslie (AnnaSophia Robb) who has the same dilemma as Jess (and also happens to be his next-door neighbor). Jess is picked on by a boy named Scott while Leslie deals (and eventually solves) a girl named Janice. However, since they have to deal with the bullying day in and day out (plus a dysfunctional family for Jess), the two kids decide to wander out into the forest beyond their homes where imagination completely takes over. The kids discover a new world full of evil forces and good-hearted warriors.It's too bad that the land of Terabithia (as the new world in the forest is called) isn't more prominently displayed. Most of the time is spent in the ""real world"" where the kids solve their problems with the bullies. At first, the whole scheme of the fantasy land seems forced, but the movie progresses very well to make the land of Terabithia very enjoyablefor the all-to-brief time we the viewer actually gets to experience it. More time in Terabithia would've put this film up there with the likes of Children of Menalmost.Bridge to Terabithia makes me think of Eragon. The fantasy genre/setting and young, optimistic characters pull the two movies close together. While I think that Bridge is the better movie by a bit, Eragon has something that Bridge needs: a very good soundtrack to fit the story. The music in Bridge is okay, but it's nothing to blow you out of the water. I'm not asking for a soundtrack as good as Titanic's or Gladiator's here. However, the music of Eragon (esp. the theme song by Jem) is masterful and something that Bridge could've used.So, after watching Bridge to Terabithia, I have to say I was impressed and moved. This is probably the most emotional PG movie I have ever seen, and I know I'm not alone when I say that. The setting and characters obviously had some time put into them, and it shows. Had more time been put into what the film was billed as (read: fantasy land), the movie would've been even better. When the setting took prolonged breaks from Terabithia, the movie still presented itself very well (if a little cheesy at times). I recommend this movie to people who enjoy feeling uplifted at the movie theatre.Good) Very deep for a young movie, great acting Bad) Spend more time on the ""imaginary"" world Terabithia Shocker) I agree with the critics for once (metacritic.com meta-score= 74/100 -very good-)",Bridge to Terabithia

150,MikeK1987,"Horrible, Horrible, Horrible...",1,29 June 2010,"I went into this film expecting something of a Sci-Fi/Fantasy epic, instead I get a poorly written film about suffering. WTF??? It should've been a film about 2 kids who found a portal in their backyard to another dimension or something of that caliber. At least it would've been interesting.I have many, many gripes with this film, but I'm only gonna stick to a select few. First off, the characters are all 1-dimensional cardboard cut-outs that followed cliché after cliché. How about some originality in your characters Hollywood screen writers? The ending is the worst part. The girl dies and what does the boy do? He escapes into his fantasy world! Call me over-analytical, but isn't that pretty much the triggering of some form of psychosis in a person? When that kids turns 21 and starts murdering people with a machete, he'll probably be completely out of it, thinking that he hunted wild wildebeests to appease the Terabithian overlords. The movie starts and ends with the boy in the same boat, under-appreciated overactive imagination. The only difference being that at the end, the overactive imagination is a coping device to hide from the cold and suffering of the real world. That is a recipe for a future serial killer! What were the author and the screenwriters thinking??? Also, these kids look to be about 12-13, the age when we stop having imaginary friends and fantasy worlds in our backyards, and start puberty and sneak peeks at our dad's Playboy. This film was marketed and cast for the wrong age group!!!! Where was Zooey Deschanel when I was in grade school? I would've loved to have her as my music teacher. My music teacher always made us listen to lame Christian rock music. To have gotten an education in Motown via a hippie chick with a guitar, a box full of percussion instruments, and a real appreciation for the arts, would've been a HUGE step up.Speaking of religion, the Christianity thrown in at various points was totally and completely unnecessary. Not to knock Christianity, but what was the point? Were you trying to say that Leslie was going to go to hell, because she came from an agnostic or atheist family and her soul may or may not have been in God's good graces at the time of her death?Basically, they wrote the wrong film. They cast the wrong leads. They marketed it poorly. They inserted religious dogma for no reason. And Zooey Deschanel is awesome, but see her in almost every other movie she's done besides this one. That's it. Don't see this movie.",Bridge to Terabithia
151,jz-10,What an adaptation should be.,8,11 July 2007,"It was interesting for me to watch Bridge to Terabithia right after The Da Vinci Code. Both were best-selling books, adored by their fans, and posed daunting tasks for creating an adaptation. Ron Howard's Da Vinci Code technically hit the right notes, but a like a MIDI sound file, was awkward and soulless. He never considered that we needed to empathize with Langdon to become involved in the story.Not so with Csupo's Bridge to Terabithia. In only a very few minutes we are irresistibly drawn into Jess Arons' world, recognizing emotions that we all know and which we all can identify with. And as Josh Hutcherson is perfect in providing the protagonist to throw us into the story, AnnaSophia Robb is perfect in propelling the story itself, as her presence, charm, and imagination light up Josh's rather gloomy life, and light up the screen with hope and joy.I was curious how well Terabithia could be expanded to movie length, since the book was so short, but the screenwriters did a superb job, staying true to the book, fleshing it out with situations that perfectly complete it. Despite what you may see in the trailers, this is anything but a fantasy film. Special effects probably have less than five minutes of total screen time... yet their timing and fluidity create a seamless tapestry of make-believe and reality.Well done!",Bridge to Terabithia
152,asalem182,"A Magical, Clever Film",7,17 February 2008,"A long time ago, in a land far far away, films aimed at children used to be intelligent, used to have a heart. Now, we're stuck with likes of Daddy Day Camp, Shrek the Third and Are we Done Yet? Fortunately (and surprisingly), Bridge to Terabithia is a throwback to the films we fell in love with while we were growing up. The film tells the story of Jesse (Hutcherson) and Leslie (Robb), a couple of kids who invent a magical place called Terabithia where they dub themselves the King and Queen. Terabithia reminded me of why I love movies in the first place. It was a clever, magical, and visually stunning flick about the wonders of imagination and friendship. The film also has its heart in the right place. It's heartwarming, touching, and I'm sure there won't be a dry eye in the house by the time the credits roll. Hutcherson and (especially) Robb were both excellent, and the rest of the cast was pretty solid as well. However, the film isn't flawless. There was a subplot about school bullies that went nowhere, and I felt there were some slow spots but still, Terabithia was one of the best family films of recent memory.",Bridge to Terabithia
153,MadWatch,As others have noted: This was a misrepresented movie,4,29 December 2007,"I just felt the need to add my voice to the many other reviewers that felt that this movie was 'misrepresented'. I do not want to counter anyone that did like the movie, because I am not saying that Bridge to Terabithia was a 'bad' movie. I am simply saying that it is NOT the movie that was advertised.I can actually summarize, very briefly, my whole issue with this movie: The advertisement for this movie was tailored in such a way that it leads the audience to believe that it is a light hearted fantasy movie about some teenage characters that travel to the mystical world of Terabithia, have adventures and meet fairy tale beings.However, that is not true. Instead the movie is actually a drama about a teenage boy, his relationship with his new friend and how he copes with the death of his friend.Imagine going to see a rip-roaring action movie, because the trailers showed all manner of 'action' scenes. But when you watch the movie, you find out that it is really a romance/drama movie and the 'action' scenes shown in the trailers were only daydreams that one of the main character had.As a drama movie, it was okay (I would rate it 5/10). However, as a fantasy/adventure movie that I was led to believe I would be seeing, I rate it 1/10.",Bridge to Terabithia
154,JolinKnight,"If you admire a friendship like this, you are probably happy with your life",8,23 September 2013,"Like I said there must be someone admire the little friendship like our small actors'. Fine I admit that I was kind of envy them, thinking about what a beautiful thing if I had a friend different gender with me like in the movie. They talk everything, they stay together everyday, maybe that's because they are still young. LOL Think about it one more time, it is actually because they are both lonely both need friends to talk to play to look after each other. In other words they are the children who has no friends at beginning, the children need friendship, the children admire us who have got friendship already. From the other direction, this kind of children are the ones who deserve friendship, they are the ones who treat their friends like a real friend, their friendship are the forever ones.I think the other thing this movie wants to tell us is that you will never know children's world. The get a pure heart infinite imagination and have nothing real big to worry about. It's like a gift God for children letting them live in more than one beautiful world. So in my opinion, just let them fly, let them dream, and let their dreams come true. In many countries, the education has already killed children's imagination, they scrap the gifts without awareness. It's not fair for children and also you nobody has the right to do that.So please don't deny the ideas from children, encourage them as best as you can. There's no need to make a beautiful world for them, because they can make it more beautiful than you, trust me!",Bridge to Terabithia
155,Subzero7,"For kids, and KIDS ONLY! Possible spoilers",5,20 February 2007,"If Disney was trying for a family film for ""kids of all ages,"" they failed miserably. This movie is ONLY for kids. And I would go a step further and say that it was only for kids between the ages of 7 to 10; maybe 11 at the most. That's not to say that there won't be some older kids and adults that won't like it, but I would expect most older kids won't and adults only go because they half to take their kids to see it. But I would say it is too intense for kids under the age or 7 (maybe 8).A movie about a young boy and girl that meat at a new school and become friends. Both have strong imaginations that let them find and play in a secluded area of the forest that they live by. They deem it to be a fantasy world of beauty. With castles and giants and other fantasy people and creatures.The movie deals with school playground politics and first loves as it follows the two main characters. It also deals a little with they subject of God and death.I was surprised to see the banter between the two main stars and the boy's little sister over God and hell and speculation about believing the bible and ""being damned to hell."" While I don't have a problem with kids discussing such things, it seemed a little out of place in the movie. It didn't seem to need to be there. Even many in the audience made gasps or sounds of surprise as well as a few comments like, ""Disney is going to get letters about this."" Usually Disney ""family"" films don't have any language in them but in this one, besides the kids talking about being ""damned to hell,"" the dad says ""damn"" several times. And then there is sequence dealing with the death. Again I don't have a problem with death in the movie but I think that parents with kids under the age of about 7, should not let them see this movie for another couple of years. Wait until it comes out on video and see it at home.My biggest gripe, though, is that the trailer made this movie out to be along the lines of Chronicles of Narnis. Where the kids actually do stumble into a fantasy land and help save it from some bad guys. But, it is NOTHING like that. It is, instead, just about kids using their imaginations and pretending. That is just fine for kids but I don't want to see it.It was WAY too sappy for me, and I would expect for most older kids and adults as well. Usually when a movie is mainly for kids, it's rated G and advertised as a children's movie. If that would have been the case, then I would have had to sit through this drudge.Again for kids, it's an excellent movie, but for older kids and adults, not so much. It is because of this fact, that they advertised it as a film the whole family could enjoy, when clearly it is not, that I'm only giving it a neutral score of 5 and not more.The acting is descent and the special effects are excellent, but that is not enough to overcome the feeling that I needed a shot of insulin after seeing it to deal with how sugary it was.Take your kids if you must, but otherwise, wait until it comes out of video so that you can put it in and let them watch it while you do something else.",Bridge to Terabithia

It's anout a lonely boy who befriends a creative, free spirited and imaginatlive girl. And together they make up their own little world in the woods, just like i'm sure many of us did as kids. She gets him to open up and find joy again, and he starts to really like her. The tragedy strikes and the girl dies in a horrible accident, and we get to follow him as he goes through the grieving process. So many emotions, sadness, anger, self hatred. Feeling like noone can replace her so he might as well be alone again. And as the lasts steps of him mourning he finally starts to move on, building a bridge to the 'magical' forest where he brings his sister whom he has fought with. It is a beautiful ending, and it showcases how even after we lose someone, what they made us and gave us will still always be there. Her imagination and creativity stayed with him and i think through life we all learn lessons and adapt things from our friends and family even people we grow apart from or get seperated from are in a way always a part of us.

158,Margera4445,What Wonderous Things Happen When We Keep Our Minds Open,10,25 May 2008,"The Bridge to Terabithia was on a sitting on a shelf in Best Buy on the day of my niece's 6th birthday. She had heard about the film and said, ""I wanna get this one!"". As promised, we purchased it and went to my house. After finally fumbling to unwrap it, we put it in the DVD player and started it up. Now, usually, when watching a Disney movie, I say to myself, ""Cant wait for some more 'believe in yourself' crap to come out and nip me in the bud."", but this time, it was different. It was about believing in something much bigger than myself. Here is my review of Bridge to Terabithia.Jess (Josh Hutcherson: Zathura) is a young boy who lives in Northwestern America on a vegetable farm. He goes to a small school and is met by constant bullying by two boys. One day, while sitting in class, Jess meets a new girl, Leslie (AnnaSophia Robb: Because of Winn Dixie). Although she is met with much hostility from Jess, Leslie constantly follows him and attempts to form a friendship. In the middle of the school day, Jess competes in a race with some of the bullies as well as Leslie, who tops all of the boys, including Jess in the race. At the end of the day, Jess learns that Leslie happens to be his new neighbor as well as classmate. Leslie challenges him to a race through the pasture and Jess agrees, send his sister home to play with dolls. As they race, they come to a stop in a small forest. There, they find an abandoned rope hanging over a small crick. They swing on it to test the strength before swinging to the other side. They swing across the crick and walk into the forest. As they make their journey, Leslie decides to play a game. But what starts out as a game, turns into a magical world that's only entered through an open mind and a creative eye. The imagination of these two is the bridge to a new world...The Bridge to Terabithia.CONCEPT - 10/10 - A wonderful children/family film. So much of the situations that are shown in this film happen to kids everywhere, and if they watch it, they can learn that stress in life can be put behind them by keeping an open mind and having a sense of imagination.STORY - 10/10 - A refreshing story of friendship and love. The most saddening end to a movie since My Girl when Jess loses Leslie to an accident but keeps up his strength to see that Terabithia is still alive shows that even if you lose someone, you can still produce great things.CAST - 10/10 - AnnaSophia Robb and Josh Hutcherson together are like two peas in a pod. Josh is an amazing actor with a lot of talent, I can't wait to see him in the movies of the future. AnnaSophia is a beautiful actress with a stunning knack for acting. Her smile really lights up the screen. She could be the next Dakota Fanning, if not better.This movie really touched my heart and made me feel like I had been looking back at what I used to do as a kid. I hope that so many kids who have seen this film understand the message that it conveys.From the Reviewer's Square JP",Bridge to Terabithia

As has been said by other reviewers, the previews gave an impression that was misleading. My expectations were of a fantasy world similar to other Disney computer-generated animation films. I was expecting something upbeat. However, this movie spent most of it's time in the ""real"" world of childhood. Bullies, yearning for parent's attention, fitting in, and other sources of anxiety, reside there. I believe this movie dealt with them in a creative and charming way. It certainly was touching. Young children, (my recommendation), under age 10, might be upset and unable to get past the tragic moments. Otherwise, this movie held together from start to finish. The casting was believable therefore the acting was natural. Children and adults can find something to take home in Bridge to Terabithia.

This movie is truly stunning how it not only draws you in but keeps you wondering what's going to happen next. The thing that really got me going was Annasohia Robb is a great actor for one and brilliant. I really like how the movie grasped the fantasy and still wove a great tail. The boy (Josh hutcherson) is always picked on at school and did not really fit in. His life was basically over till he met this new girl on the block and she told him of the magical world that lies before him. Josh Hutcherson was fantastic in the movie Firehouse Dog.

166,robertdegeus,Surprise! (in a good way),10,1 April 2015,"This is one of the best children's films I've ever seen. As far as films in general go, it's pretty high up there as well. Maybe that's because I wasn't expecting what happened. Maybe it's the reality of the joy and wonder AnnaSophia Robb. Maybe its the sheer talent of Josh Hutcherson (See Little Manhattan). There are so many great things about this film that it's hard to figure out what shines. It all does. I'll start with the story, even before the aforementioned twist, I was hooked. It's a very engaging story, but dark. The star has trouble with his father, his family is struggling with money. He's bullied, pushed around and treated mostly bad for a fair amount of the film. It's very well written and most people can relate, at least to an extent.The film itself is beautiful, they don't overuse graphics and it was shot in New Zealand to get that beautiful greeny-earth look. It's colors aren't vibrant, but it fit the story and works very well.The acting is excellent. Josh Hutcherson is one of the great child actors. If you don't believe me, go watch Little Manhattan (another kids film). The father plays a bit of a jerk really well, not that it's hard. The person I was most impressed with though was AnnaSophia Robb, she brought this sense of innocence and quirkiness that made the film great, it could not have worked without her. Zooey Deschanel played her part well, but there wasn't a very large role for her, even if her character was important.Overall, the film was extremely good and I wish Disney would make more like this.One last thing, there is a lot of controversy over the ""twist"" in this film. Claiming it was inappropriate or unexpected. That was the purpose, that kind of thing happens in real life and the film is very sensitive and respectful of the subject. They don't show anything or give any graphic information, but dealing with that is an important part of life and if you're not willing to expose your children to that, they wont excel in the authentic world we live in. It could definitely be construed as bad parenting.",Bridge to Terabithia

To cash as much money as possible, films are advertised as something they're not. It's getting worse and worse. I remember seeing ""The Groomsmen"", a film with and by Edward Burns.

I can understand that some films are hard to market and at least must earn there cost. break even so to speak. But that was so missing the mark. It did not only upset people that were expecting a gross comedy but ultimately the film could not find an audience.Now this.

I personally hate fantasy; films like LOTR, Narnia etc. It's uninspired stuff. Magic without any imagination. So i was ready to zap it away, but it started off promising so I stuck around. It turned out to be one of the best (youth)dramas i have ever seen. It's a simple story of growing up, fighting to stay on your feet and dealing with reality. Not your average Harry potter or Narnia theme, I would say. More important: the fantasy is used here as it should. As an tool to deal with life's hardships. To not feel the pain of life getting closer as you grow up. Being a child. The two leads are great. Although the girl was a bit too cute and sparkly to convince as a ""loner"". The story clearly was trimmed to fit the size of a movie script, but it all fits quite perfectly. The pace is good, the CGI very well done and used to great effect.

170,jaypugh,LOL! Reviewers blaming other reviewers for Disney's False Advertising!,4,20 June 2007,"First off I have to say that I'm truly amazed at the number of people BLAMING parents (or other reviewers in general) for not doing research on a Disney movie that is portrayed as a FAMILY movie yet it is not. Give me a break! I'm sorry but I'm on the net a lot and research movies a lot but it isn't in my normal practice to research a Disney flick that is advertised as a kid's movie to see if it is really a kid's movie. Plus, half of the time you don't have enough reviews BEFORE a movie comes out to gauge by IMO. I'm a parent and I took my 8 year old son to see this movie. We do a lot of deep talking about different subjects that are difficult and he takes it in well. I think more than most kids his age because I have never been one to simply let my son watch something and not talk about difficult matter. I think more parents should spend time talking about difficult topics in movies instead of simply avoiding them all together as if their child will magically never see it in the future. All that being said, the film honestly wasn't as bad as some portray it to be. Yes there is tragedy but the film has its good points. As I Christian I must say that saying, ""you don't have to believe in Jesus to go to Heaven"" is misleading and false assumption taken by many who want to simply make their own fictitious theology but that is another topic entirely. Even with my disagreement of this I premise set in the movie I thought the film was OK IF you disregard all of the advertising of the movie. The characters are better than most films today and the acting was superb. Per the advertising I would give this film a 1 because Terabithia was no more than the few brief moments that you see in the trailers. The title should be completely changed to something else if you ask me. I guess that would keep the tons of Disney fans away though if you have a name like, ""Childhood Tragedies."" Hmmm.. So, although I would give the film a 1 due to advertising I would give it more like a 6 if I had known nothing about the film. My compromised score is a 4. Simply put, this can be a great film. There are good things about it but it isn't feel good material. Be ready for deep subject matter and forget the trailers.

172,Bosco-HK,"A movie out of the ordinary, don't you think so.",7,24 June 2007,"Some school kids just attract too much attention because they are afraid of the other school kids. Leslie Burke (Annasophia Robb) was a very unique and caring student who did not fall a victim categorized either 'new girl' or 'lower-grade' victim. She was able to blend into the class with her talents and her extraordinary imagination. She gave one such kid, who can be depicted as yourself in your school if you are the tiny one, Jesse Aarons (Josh Hutcherson). Although he was a pretty tough real life kid, he played the role of a bully victim very well and he also believed that girls can do anything such as running fast and building from planks of wood, just like boys can. She definitely freed his mind from the nature of school life and brought him into the both the real and fantasy world where ""you are who you are"" a great artist, and ""do you see"" what i can see if you just ""close your eyes and keep your mind wide open"", and that it does not matter what other people think or what others believe you can or cannot do. Leslie Burke: ""We're the rulers of Terabithia, and nothing crushes us!"" The gesture definitely showed that she was brave and finally found happiness at her new home. Annasophia also was portraying kind of a nerdy girl student role except without glasses and ugly hair. Leslie Burke: ""What if you don't have a TV?"" ... ""My dad says that TV destroys brain cells."" ... ""I rest my case."" One last quote from Leslie, Leslie Burke: (Jess tries to hand Leslie the fake letter to Janice Avery) ""You have to write it. No offense but boys' handwriting sucks!"" I couldn't prevent myself from laughing and thinking about the same thing, what if I asked another girl for assistance in writing a love letter. And that line was definitely easy for her, it's a natural real life thing. I believe my handwriting sucks. The most funny scene I thought was the running scene where Leslie suddenly caught up with the boys and Jesse. Also, the look on Jesse's face and Jesse's determination to strive and stride as hard as he could for the win, definitely reminded me of several Stephen Chow movies and his humorous scenes of similar events.Jesse also later welcomes his younger sister, May Belle Aarons (Bailee Madison), who violated Jesse's picture-book privacy. I thought that her phone call scene was very cute: ""It's your girlfriend."" However, her intrusion was a rather unique one that he should have more faith in her that she is not like the other sisters. In the end, living out the tragedy of his best found girl-friend, he no longer feels that her sisters are his frustrations but just another friend who he can play with and enjoy life with just like Leslie.Every other actors and actresses performed with an ecstatic essence, parents and the school troublemakers.On a side note, the many days of the storm caused the creek waters to rise higher and higher, he should of have known better. He also took too much pride in his own interest and his crush on the teacher that he had forgotten to invite his new best friend, closer to his age, to the museum to possibly prevent the tragic fate. That morning, as his teacher, Ms. Edmonds (Zooey Deschanel), drove him past her house, just like every other commentators for this movie, we know that something bad is about to happen, it is related to the rising waters of the creek caused by the recent storms, to that scene where Jesse begins to fall in love with Leslie, who was holding her dog, as she was running back to her home and her gloomy-looking house from the outside that morning. However, I really wish there was more parts to Leslie than there actually is. I felt heartbroken and started to tear when the news struck 'so sudden' despite the fact that 'we will or we already know' what can happen from those two depictions. These are just some things that go through the audience's mind.Also, the music provided a lot of insight in this film I thought, this is a children's movie with older-aged group theme of friendship and a higher sense of possible real life tragedy when you are allowed to venture into places yourself without the knowledge of overprotective parents. ""Why Can't We Be Friends?"" expressed the neglect of girls in Jesse's life AND school life, ""Someday"" guided us into the bonding of relationships and the unfortunate occurrence. Overall, this is definitely one of the best movies because it is unlike most movies that always ends with ""...and they lived happily ever after"". I recommend this movie to everyone who would love to see a different ending than most children movies, not for the fact that I'd like to see someone die, but one of the main characters dying is definitely shocking to see in most of the children movies out there.",Bridge to Terabithia
173,Survive_Kino,"a young boy who is bullied, finds a new friends with whom he imagines a fantasy world of escapism, he retreats further into this world when she dies",5,24 September 2007,"This adaptation of a children's novel starts out as a rather clichéd story of a young boy who feels alienated by both his family and class mates, he is bullied, and finds it difficult to communicate with his agricultural American family who are under financial pressure. a new girl named Leslie arrives at his school with whom he builds a relationship, as she recognises his artistic ability and encourages him to imagine a fantasy world in the woods near where they both live. The film seems inappropriate for children, there are very obvious attempts to subvert a peculiar type of protestant liberalism to children which comes across as a distasteful dislike of modernism, rationality and agricultural values, also condemning violence whilst simultaneously validating it as a form of vengeance, however it is perhaps inappropriate for younger viewers not for this reason, but because of its bleak and depressing style, which I imagine only a minority of children would find entertaining.There is however redemption from these flaws, firstly in the fascinating relationship between the two childhood friends, and the remarkable insight into the concerns and motives of children and their psychology. The fantasy sequences are likely to win over younger viewers as they are imaginative and compelling. But the most striking feature of the film, is how the theme completely changes when Leslie is killed, changing the film from sickly sweet sentimentalism to original social commentary on how young people are expected to cope with loss and death, two subjects very seldom addressed in children's films with the maturity and emotional sensitivity displayed in this one.",Bridge to Terabithia
174,Tippy_Cup,"Good, could've easily been better though.",7,15 July 2008,"When I watch Children's' films I kind of watch it in two frames of mind running simultaneously. One being in a state of mind which will reflect on my childhood and be all nostalgic in relation to what is going on on screen. The other being, kind of imagining watching the movie with my children (when I have them). (I'm 25 so I guess it makes sense because of my age, even if it seems a wee bit strange)So as I was watching 'Bridge to Terabithia' it kind of reminded me of the episode of 'The Wonder Years' when Kevin kisses Winnie. Childhood friendship, with someone of the opposite sex, verging on innocent romantic feelings.I thought that as a child, the kid growing up in a small town with no real friends, could still be relatable to someone who grew up in a city in another country besides the US, who had many friends. As long as the child is creative. I don't know how to justify that statement. I guess if you know what I mean, you know what I mean, and if you don't, you don't.I thought the revelation of Leslies' death was truly surprising, and therefore quite impactful. The kids were all good actors, Jessie, Leslie and his little sister, but for some reason there were parts where the chemistry was just a little...off. Zooey D. was perfect for the teacher a 12ish year old kid would develop a crush on, and she handled her role perfectly.Now the bad. What the hell was up with the AWFUL, AWFUL pop music in it. Not only does it make it less respectful now, it will only date it terribly. There could've been plenty of actual music that would've gone really well with it....for some reason Simon and Garfunkle are popping into my head, at parts when they were running around but there wasn't really any fantasy going on.As I mentioned before there were a few parts that just seemed off (chemisty wise). It was probably the kids inexperience, but I can't exactly put my finger on it, need a second viewing.All round though, a good movie for kids, I can imagine it being a movie that a lot of children will grow up holding it dear to them.I probably felt that this would be a 7.5 but as you can't vote that. 7/10(Reviewed after first viewing)",Bridge to Terabithia
175,sethness,"Simplistic, insulting to non-Christians. Good SFX.",4,13 October 2007,"I saw this film as an in-flight film, and was glad to have a book with me. When it came on television a few months later, it held so little interest that I could only watch a few minutes before becoming bored.Although the premise, magical world, and special effects are reminiscent of a Harry Potter film, the storyline is far too formulaic and preachy.Of far more importance to me was the extremely preachy and arrogant stance the film's Christian characters take. Non-Christians will be deeply offended by the film, and should avoid it.One should also caution children that although imagination is a good thing, creating an alternate reality and trying to live in it is as unhealthy as, and similar to, playing video games all day.A final criticism would be how the film describes its bully-- I was offended at how it portrayed a lummox-like bully character as a two-dimensional figure. One is left with the feeling that all the characters--even the main characters-- are described with the same lack of depth, objectivity, and detail as line-art doodles in a coloring book page.In short, I expect you'll enjoy the SFX, but would be far better advised to see ""James and the Giant Peach"", ""Finding Nemo"", or even a Harry Potter film.",Bridge to Terabithia

It certainly ain't what we might have expected from the purely upbeat trailers! And perhaps if I had gone into it more I would have steered my daughter away from it as her birthday treat. But I would have been wrong. It was a great film. Ladies and gentlemen, any film that can tell you at an early age and in this way that bad stuff happens and it doesn't happen for any reason - that is a film that has to be seen. It broke me up, but surely the great moral is that by the end of the story Jesse has a permanent link between the real and the imaginary worlds. I don't want to go too Nietzschian on you, but the end of the film is a strong one. I can't imagine that Jesse would claim the bridge was worth what it cost him; but he is right. Pretty much the worst thing he could have imagined has happened to him, and he has not been crushed nor become bitter. As a coming of age film it has to be up there with Stand by Me; as a fantasy film with Princess Bride (and there the book is well worth reading too)....and my daughter wanted it for Christmas, which just goes to show it must have made the right sort of impression on her.",Bridge to Terabithia

However I got majorily disappointment when I saw the previews. I was thinking it would do something like a Neverending Story where the world came to life through imagination and I didn't want that at all for this story. It's simply and beautifully told and more about friendship and the power of imagination then the fantasy world itself.The previews are so misguiding. I almost didn't see it tell the Ebert and Roeper reviews were saying how wonderful it was and how different it is from the previews. The previews make it look like a fantasy film and it's not. It's just a bunch of 30 second clips of Leslie and Jess's imagination and it's clear all of it's in their minds and not real.The storyline is beautiful and different and more realistic then some story lines that are in movies today and they keep it VERY close to the book which is a rare thing these days. Probably one of the best book adaptations for a children's film that I have seen.WARNING! There is a death in the book that drives the plot majorily forward and it might be to much for young children to handle and it has a very moving and emotional end to the story. It may make you cry. I did and I never cry in movies but it's so touching and moving.This is probably the best family film I have seen in ages. This is what family films are meant to be. Wonderful and moving for the entire family-not just for one person.Watch this movie-trust me, you won't regret it! I'm horrified that I almost passed this movie up due to the previews-don't pay any attention to them. It's not some cheap fantasy rip off of LOTR or Narnia.

I thought it was supposed to be a fantasy story where two kids escape and cope with the troubles they're going through. But instead, they screw things over.Here we have a boy who gets bullied, then meets a girl who has an imagination and takes him with her. So the story seems to be OK, until they threw in a religious content. All I can say is what were these people thinking?! Why did they throw in a religious content in a fantasy story? That's like watching Harry Potter and then someone records passion of Christ in the middle of it! Seriously, I'm appalled at this. When the little girl asked if they believed in the Bible, the heroine says no. There was never a point in bringing that in! Then shortly, they killed her off. I was shocked, angry and feeling like screaming bloody murder. Even though I cried, I wasn't crying because it was a sad story, I cried because they killed off a girl for no good reason. Not only did they kill her off for no good reason, it happened after she said she didn't believe in the Bible. I don't know if the writers and the author were Christians or not, but it is never a good idea to put in religious beliefs. Keep your religious dogma to yourself! To the author, if you're going to preach your religion, preach it elsewhere and not in your book! We're trying to enjoy a story, not to be threatened with, ""Believe in God or you're gonna burn!"" Then what happens? They get the boy to escape into la-la land with her little sister, which I may add that I suspect her responsible for the death of the heroine, and never deal with the reality. This is not a good film and it should have been thrown in the trash.I strongly recommend people to never watch this. Do not rent it or buy it. It's a piece of junk and it lacks a storyline, it lacks a plot, it inserted a religious threat in the middle, it ended with a bad ending.

184,rshepard42796,A movie to watch again and again.,9,24 February 2007,"From the beginning this movie shows it means business. In a few short scenes we learn of the difficulties of a young boy named Jesse in a large family that forgets he's there except when there is work to be done, and who is at the bottom of the pecking order among his school peers. That all changes when Leslie moves in next door and happens to be in his same class at school. She too is lonely, because she is an only child and her parents are too busy with their own lives. After a rocky start their friendship grows and becomes a bulwark against the troubles they each face in the world. Leslie's rich imagination helps them create their own ""Terabithia"" in which they can play out the fantasies of all girls and boys, of Kings and Queens, good and evil, trolls and elves. The themes and--dare I say it?--lessons contained in this movie are multiple and deep. As with many movies based on Newbury Award books, this is not content-less fluff masquerading as a story looking for market tie-ins. Some younger children may even be overwhelmed. But this movie treats those themes with a delicacy and dignity rarely found in what passes as art these days. It is a movie to watch again and again. Although the entire cast is superb, Anna Sophia Robb stands out and is magnificent as Leslie. Her portrayal is bright and delightful, exactly fitting her character. This, along with her performance in ""Because of Winn-Dixie"", leads me to believe she will be a major star for many years to come--if only she can successfully make the transition from kid roles to adult roles. If there is anything to criticize in this beautiful and beautifully developed tale, it is over-reliance of the makers on computer graphics in the fantasy scenes. Obviously given the importance of fantasy to the story some CGI was crucial. But in certain scenes, especially the closing scene, it overpowered the story.

It just feels overly whimsical. Last but not least, the dialog is very dated, it needs to be updated. Verdict: While I am not a fan of this movie, I guess if someone wanted to watch it, it's harmless enough. Plus, I didn't read the book so I don't know how loyal it was to it.

Imagination helps children to grow up in a world full of nasty adults who can't keep their hands of their children anymore without thinking filthy, without abusing them, without giving them hope for a future. This movie is how Disney should be. Nice to have 3D animated features, but the combination of animation and real images like in this movie is much better. It even gives adults the chance to go back in time, remembering those moments we all had our own day dreams, imaginary friends and worlds of fantasy we would like to escape to.

It is such a good film on lots of levels. The most important point is that you quickly believe in the central characters. It's really well acted and - SPOILER - handles death with great sensitivity and reality. Everyone says they cried watching it and okay, I sniffled too, but you'd want to be callous not to! The lessons of life are tough and we all go through them growing up. There's bullying, lack of support, isolation and tragic loss. But there is also that teenager linking to another place. There's a friend which you think may be more and the awkwardness that that creates, as you tip toe into romance. And there's escape to another world. Where teenagers can escape to - no kids or adults allowed. There's the freedom to be your true self, uncaged. The joy of finding someone to share that world with and the grief from having that thorn apart.Josh Hutcherson and AnnaSophia Robb are superb stars with great futures. Director, Gabor Csupo, has given them great scope to shine. They capture the emotions of teenagers and the dark side of life. The CGI is non- intrusive but may lull parents into thinking that this film is aimed at a younger audience. I'd say this is for aspiring teenagers up to adults. Men may dismiss this as a chick flick, but it's not. It's for anyone who has ever been a teenager, or dreamed, or felt, or loved. An unsupervised box of tissues would be appreciated!

Everyone was expecting a coming-of-age story that would involve a kid creating a fantasy world and having to save it.But what we get is something way different and much better. This movie spends 80% of the time in the real world, and actually only spends a small bit in the fantasy world.This movie is not your average children's film. It's much deeper and deals with more mature things than just imagination. It touches on redemption, kindness, friendship, forgiveness, violence, and guilt just to name a few.The development of the characters was done extremely well, and the characters were very realistic. You really seem to be friends right there with the two main characters. This makes Leslies death much more affective. The death comes at a moment when byou would least expect it. And when it is finally revealed that she is dead, it seems almost as unbelievable and horrible to us as it does to the main character.It seems like there can be no resolution after the death, which is just perfect, because that's exactly how the main character feels. You actually feel that everything is going to be horrible from that point on, and it makes you want to hopelessly cry.The acting itself is wonderful. I don't know how they managed to find such talented children, but however they did it, it really paid off. They were amazing and believable, not overly dramatic.This film is never boring, and you care about the characters from the first time you see them until the end.

194,poojucu,Better then I thought,8,3 June 2007,"Bridge to Terabithia is not a bad movie. In fact I would put it in the same category as Narnia. Some things worked for me, and some things did not, but overall in the end It shows something very special. Bridge to Terabithia is set and revolves around a young lonely boy, meeting a young lonely girl, they are both social outcasts at their school and after a connection is struck they soon realise that they can escape their lives by using their imaginations. Sure enough like the title suggests, they create a mythical land known as ""Terabithia"" in the Forest nearby. They venture into the forest every afternoon, fighting fantasy creatures, building their fort, and ultimately talking and learning from one another. The numerous sub-plots revolve around the school they go too, and by using generic bully's and characters the director has made the whole thing more accessible to a younger audience.For me I found that this part of the movie, was more interesting then the actual storyline. I don't really know why, but I found myself being disappointed with the happenings and occurrences within Terabithia. It wasn't very exciting, whereas the stuff at school was. However being one of the few people who have not read the books I found the ending very surprising, and to be honest quite thought provoking. When I found out that the girl had drowned, attempting to get into Terabithia it had a profound impact on me. I was shocked, and this emotion made the next few scenes all the more effective and powerful. I was sad that she had died, but still I did not want her to come back. After the boy finally gets over her death, and the almost bitter sweet ending is before you, I suddenly realized that the movie was actually not that bad. I had gotten over the boring writing, and almost lazy storyline by the shock ending and sad emotions the final scenes had delivered.Overall Bridge to Terabithia shows something special, and thought provoking in the end, and that is what I'll remember about it.",Bridge to Terabithia

This is an incredibly enjoyable and emotional movie that treats all its characters like real people dealing with real problems, particularly treating its kids like real kids with real problems and solutions, or lack thereof.Jesse (Josh Hutcherson) lives on a farm with his Dad, four older sisters and one younger sister. They often encounter financial difficulties, meaning Jesse is commonly making do with his sisters' hand-me-downs and the stigma of being a ""farmboy"" at school. He really doesn't have any friends at school, so he settles for being the fastest kid there. He draws in his spare time. One day, a new girl comes to the school, Leslie (AnnaSophia Robb). Her parents are writers and they don't watch TV, and she doesn't hide any of this. Furthermore, she can outrun Jesse.Jesse and Leslie grow together as outcasts, and Leslie's imagination leads him to go along with her and create an imaginary world to escape life's problems in the woods near his house. This world is somewhat Calvin&Hobbbesian by nature, in that it's only real to them, but as we see it from their perspective it becomes real for us as well. This world of Terabithia is limited only by your imagination.The story develops from there, I won't say much more. I will note that serious events take place, the world is not perfect. But before parents start thinking this is not the movie for their children, allow me to say something more. This is a movie about growing up and finding your way in the world. It does not leave you sad, but tells you to keep moving, even after the unthinkable.Above all else, this is a movie for anyone and everyone who can still remember what it felt like to be a kid and escape into a world of your own creation. I give this movie a full 10 stars for bringing me back to that.",Bridge to Terabithia
198,moonlightshadow393,Bridge to your Heart..,10,19 May 2021,"This is not a review, it's all been written. Just a few words on how good this movie is. I'm almost 70 and watched Bridge To Terabithia alone.... I didn't plan to watch the movie, ""It isn't the sort of movie I would normally watch being a tough British Ex-Military man, but I have to admit this movie made my eyeballs leak!... ""So not so tough after all"".. ...All the kids in the movie shine in their respective roles. But the acting from the two main kids ""Josh and AnnaSophia was both outstanding and astonishing.. The film is a fairy-tale of an enchanting magical kingdom without over the top CGI.. which keeps the story more grounded and believable. It's about two kids from two different worlds that have both suffered bullying that develop true friendship and love.... The movie, its message and its delivery are all beautifully done and told....I have not read the book, (Why would I?..) ...so had no expectations.. I didn't even know about the book until I watched the movie. Anyhow I don't believe in comparing books and movies.. So many read a book and expect the movie to follow the same path, forgetting they are two completely different mediums. In my view comparing books to movies just isn't fair. Stephen King once said, comparing one to the other is like comparing apples to oranges. They are both great sources of entertainment, but they aren't comparable..Some reviewers say this film is not for kids. I disagree, children are very adaptable and it will teach them not to bully or be bullied. It will teach them about Friendship - Love - Pain - Strength - Loss - Death - Grief - Hope and Joy... I agree though. It may not be for all children, and it must be up to parents to decide, they should however be aware the end is sad.. and perhaps it isn't suitable for some children under the age of around 10..., but only a parent can make that decision... I still strongly believe it can all have a positive impact on children. It is what makes us what we are as we grow into adults, teaching us so many things from love, understanding, forgiveness, how to be faithful and show compassion for others... It also shows us how to live life to the fullest.. . ""Life isn't always a bed of roses, neither is it a dress rehearsal""..I highly recommend it.... Go and watch this movie with your friends, family and your kids.. ""You will all love it!.. You may wish to have your tissues at the ready....10/10.",Bridge to Terabithia
199,camerondalepulliam,A Bittersweet Tragedy,8,21 February 2021,"Hereditary straightforward tale with a simple plot and few characters. The kids are adorable, the teacher is a sweetheart, and the parents love their children and are there for them when the chips are down.A struggling family of seven - four girls and one boy smack in the middle - has their lives brightened and lightened when a family of three moves in next door with a daughter who is in the same class as the boy next door.Their friendship evolves into a burgeoning preadolescent romance between two bright, artistic kids. When the hammer falls, it is unexpected, swift, and brutal. And that is where I would have left the story to remind the audience that life, as Woody Allen said, is divided between the horrible and the miserable.But the story continues and everything is resolved swiftly, neatly, and unrealistically. A movie that could have been as bleak and haunting as life itself instead becomes pleasant and joyful again.But still, the pain never leaves. Not me, anyway.",Bridge to Terabithia
200,user51555,As bad as the book and then some,2,6 April 2020,"Based on a lackluster book, tried to make screenworthy, but there is not much of a story to begin with..
Book with very negative outlook
Not sure why this book got any aclaim. The language and the descriptions are offputting, with very negative feel about everything, family, teachers, school...which are the things in a kid's life. Not sure how things were in 70's but in todays day and ways, it just seem to have characters out of place. There is nothing to story either, for more than half the book there is not much of any story, just author's miserable attempt to sketch up ten year old boy and everyone else is a negative character. Writer seem to want to write about teenagers much older but is describing ten year olds. Not sure which ten year old boy has a crush on his teacher.

Unless of course they are emo teens obsessed with death.Deceptively marketed as a fantasy adventure this is nothing more than a plodding snuff film punctuated by scenes of real enjoyment--which only make the film all the worse because you realize what it could have been.Plot threads are taken up and then dropped without explanation. We see a bully get her comeuppance and then apparently take a turn for the better only to disappear from the film except as the head of a troll in brief fantasy scenes. We see one-dimensional teachers who could have added so much more depth to the movie but who are instead wasted as mere plot devices allegedly representing temptation and remorse.You get the sense that the alleged ""evil"" in the fantasy world is the boy's father. Perhaps the author had issues with her father but beyond being emotionally distant there is no evil in the boy's father. We'll never know what the author was thinking because this plot thread is simply dropped as well.My daughter was disappointed and I was ready to ask for my money back.Horrible, just horrible.",Bridge to Terabithia
202,plopmasterj,"A touching, sad, but inspiring film",9,17 July 2007,"I was able to get Bridge to Terabithia on DVD over the weekend and I watched it almost as soon as I got home. At first, I expected the film to be another Chronicles of Narnia type of movie where the kids travel to a magical land and fight evil forces while learning valuable lessons along the way. Instead, the movie was very much rooted in reality as much as possible. It did feature the creatures that the kids came up with, but for the most part, the world around them was very much down to Earth except when they let their imaginations run wild and picture an amazing world. Much of the story is focused on their lives in the real world. Jess Aaron's life isn't going very well, especially since he's not getting the attention that he needs, mainly from his father who spends most of his time at work and playing with Jess's younger sister, the very cute and innocent May Belle. On top of that, he's being bullied at school by pretty much everyone at school. After meeting a new girl named Leslie Burke, who beats him in a school race he's been training for all summer, the two become nearly inseparable pals and create their own kingdom called Terabithia in the woods across a creek behind their houses. As troubles at school get worse for the two kids, they use made up creatures based on bullies at school to find ways to deal with them in reality. They are able to use a troll version of a tough girl at school to find a way of making her become a good person in real life. An awful tragedy occurs that leaves Jess a wreck and the whole town in shock and sadness. Jess tries to use what Leslie has taught him to find ways of coping with not just the tragedy, but with life at home and at school. The movie proved to be very emotional. I cried during the scenes that occurred after the tragedy, which also shocked me as much as it shocked the characters in the story. But it all ended on a very happy note, which is a good thing when you have suffered a terrible loss. For those of you who don't like sad events in movies such as death, take caution when you watch this movie, as it may make you cry and feel sad, especially if you're really sensitive. Otherwise, this film is very touching and inspiring. You cheer on Jess and Leslie throughout their journey together, and leaves you filled with hope at the end for Jess and his family. A very good film, worth seeing by all.",Bridge to Terabithia

What I saw was a film that genuinely moved me, and will stay in my memory forever. What I saw was a film that turned me into a young boy, happy to fall in love with a young girl, in the most pure sense of the word. What I saw was friendship transcending the bounds of human interaction, and taking us all to a magical place that really does exist out there somewhere.

There was apparently a 1985 version and it may as well be from then because the effects are about as good as 1985. No one is a good actor, it's so immature. The main character the boy has a little sister who is like 4 years old and she's more mature mature than the TWO MAIN CHARACTERS!! AND THEIR LIKE 12!!

205,miketigas25,One of the few Disney movies that have touched my heart,10,11 October 2007,"Like the millions of other movie enthusiasts who got ""tricked"" by the trailer, I came in the theater expecting a Fantasy flick closely synonymous to that of Narnia or Harry Potter. Turns out it wasn't entirely what I thought it was. And I never really expected that it would touch my heart and make me re-evaluate my relationships with the people around me.A few days before watching this film, a close friend of mine committed suicide. I was shocked. I didn't know what to do. I had mixed feelings over her death. Should I be angry because she never told me anything? Should I be sad knowing that a close friend of mine had just died? Watching Bridge to Terabithia made me realize how important our friends are; that we may lose them at any moment, at any given time.Even though I knew what was coming (I actually read the book before), I was shocked when the ""revelation"" scene took place. The news given to Jesse hit me hard in the same way my Professor informed me of what happened to my friend. I understood his feelings. And that's when the movie reached in for my emotions.If a movie holds the capability to touch your heart and your emotions, then that means that it is a great movie. I thank the entire crew for a job well done. This movie is a masterpiece. Watch it.",Bridge to Terabithia

207,DreadfulA,Escape to imagination,9,26 December 2015,"Bridge to Terabithia is one of my personal favourite movies. In my opinion it's a children's story made for adults, since it might be too tragic and dark for a small child. Lot of the movie takes place at school, which is familiar to all of us. At home we see Jess' family, who, excluding the father, do stay in the background of the story. We don't ever really learn to know the older sisters and mother too well, which is my only complaint. Okay, they don't really bring anything to the actual story, but still they seem rushed. Even the father, Robert Patrick, comes out one dimensional, probably to enhance his strict attitude against Jess. He is always more demanding towards Jess, but May Belle, the younger sister, get's more wanted attention from him. Understandable because Jess is the only boy in the family.Jess and Leslie's friendship at first seem quite unlikely. Jess is an introverted boy and Leslie a new comer in school. But they quickly learn to share same visions, imagination and justice and soon become inseparable. It happens so fast, what is only possible in children's world. They don't yet have learned to be careful, because in adult world you possibly couldn't trust someone so wholeheartedly. Tragic is, that this friendship ends even quicker than it started, and it destroys the viewers heart. Watching Jess struggle his way out of disbelief and fight his all too sensible parents, and when he calls for Leslie in the woods just to wait for her to pop up from the background like she never went away, is heart wrenching. Soon Jess will learn how unfair life is, reality of it I mean. For a while he sinks in despair, grieves and loses belief in the magic world they created together. Then he finds May Belle's drawing and sees the potential in his little sister and gives her a chance. He takes May Belle with him, finally, since the little girl has wanted to join her brother's and Leslie's play from the beginning. May Belle witnesses the imaginary world together with her brother. World is saved. Terabithia again has a king, and a new princess.AnnaSophia Robb and Bailee Madison were brilliant in this movie. When Janice steals May Belle's twinkie and Leslie raises a campaign to ""free the pee"" during recess is fun to watch. I love children's stories and Bridge to Terabithia has inspired me a lot during the years. Its beautiful scenery and subtle use of CGI creates a perfect balance between fantasy and reality.",Bridge to Terabithia
208,madkaugh,Not a children's fantasy; deals with tough issues.,9,25 June 2007,"I only give Bridge to Terabithia a nine because I don't think this movie will appeal to everybody. It has a happy end of sorts, but is far more downbeat than upbeat. The Bridge to Terabithia deals with heavy issues; death, responsibility, eternal consequences. If you as an adult take your children to see this, be prepared to spend some time talking with them afterward. This movie has more in common with Old Yeller and Where the Red Fern Grows than with Chronicles of Narnia, but it's a tougher movie than either of the doggy movies.It is a very good movie, very well done. Many good nuances; the entire production crew deserves a lot of credit. The uncertainty of parenthood is portrayed especially well, the ease with which we make mistakes with our kids. Jesse's father treat him coldly until tragedy strikes.The marketing, the trailer and such, is very misleading and deserves a very low rating. Disney Studios needs a lesson about honesty.MadKaugh",Bridge to Terabithia
209,productionslykos,A touching family flick that dives deep into the life of young children and their creative minds.,8,11 April 2020,"A touching family flick that dives deep into the life of young children and their creative minds. Although acting was mediocre which in all was dismissive due to such young actors, and the dialogue wasn't Quentin Tarantino-esk, sometimes fabricating younger characters whom smarter and wittier than their factual counterparts; the heart of this narrative derived from the delightful relationships it constructed, making the ending ever more tear jerking. Even characters such as Janice, whom at first was meant to be hated, slowly sunk into my heart as my sympathy grew for their tangible dilemmas. Character's felt marginally grounded as though they lived outside of the plot, altogether adding to the touching feeling this movie reached for and grasp ever so perfectly. However, many character's, even the main two, were mildly underdeveloped and at times stale, which hurt the connection of viewer and character, sadly taking more than it gave. The underlying messages it conveyed were simple yet beautiful in that everyone has troubles, however a child's imagination can be their greatest escape as it has a potential to build worlds. In addition to the beautiful character building, the atmosphere created was magical. Aaron Zigman's score was enchanting, bridging (wink wink) scenes together, forming heartening moments plentiful of warm feelings. As well as this, the CGI abetted in bringing Terabithia to life, with impressively real character models supplied through a smaller budget. The ending was ballsy and I admittedly nearly shed a tear from both the loss of a protagonist, and the acceptance of a new 'princess' to Terabithia. Overall this movie is a bit on the nose but undoubtedly a classic in the character's it both provides and takes. I would suggest everyone watch this movie!",Bridge to Terabithia
210,quis89,One of the best family films I've seen in ages,9,17 September 2007,"This movie is at once touching, moving, endearing and profound. I loved it. I wish I had given it a chance and seen it when it was still in theaters instead of waiting to get it from Netflix.This film was completely mis-marketed. I suppose the marketing team in charge of this movie decided that they would play on the recent success of films like The Chronicles of Narnia, Harry Potter, Eragon and other fantasy films getting hype around the time this came out. However, this was, in my opinion, a terrible move, as they really had a beautiful, wonderful movie to work with and should simply have marketed it as it was, a family film, a film about friendship and family and love and coming-of-age and the importance and power of imagination. They took the ""fantasy"" parts of the movie (which were really just a minor part of it) and made it seem like that was the plot.Bridge to Terabithia's Leslie is probably one of the most endearing, lovable characters I've seen in a long time. Her unique perspective on life, her kindness and bravery make her a character you can feel very touched by.This movie actually made me cry. Made me break down and sob and I don't think I've done that during a movie since Moulin Rouge.Bridge to Terabithia is also one of the few films that I think can be called a true ""family film"" - enjoyable by the WHOLE family. Many times, films that get this label are not much fun for anybody over age 13 and are full of fart-jokes and sexual innuendo to make it ""more fun"" for the adults. But this movie isn't like that. The characters and situations will be relatable and fun for children as well as to adults. In fact, in some ways this film is probably MORE suited to adults that children due to some of the deeper aspects of the film, though in my opinion it is certainly child-appropriate.My recommendation is, definitely see this movie. In fact, buy this movie because you will probably want to see it again and again.",Bridge to Terabithia
211,greene-1,A moving and wholesome story,8,11 May 2007,"Most detractors of this film seem to focus on how they've been deceived by the promotional material, which lead them to believe they were going to see a re-hash of Land of Narnia (or something like that).Critising something simply because 'it wasn't what was expected' simply exposes the prejudices of the observer, and indicates that the reviewer's objectivity is compromised.Where this film scores highly is that it portrays children's worlds in a very immediate and powerful way without being mawkish or sentimental. It deals with real issues, such as bereavement, bullying and family life very directly. More importantly, however, it goes on to show how these issues and their associated difficulties can be transcended, by reaching for higher causes and considering the welfare of others.The other great thing about this film is that it encourages consideration of art, imagination, and philosophy. It ponders the nature of life and divinity in a simple, inquisitive and ultimately positive way. Furthermore, it deprecates the practise of excessive TV viewing, which is to be applauded.The performances reflect pure emotions not only because children's emotions are generally purer than adults, but also many of the actors do an outstanding job.I heartily recommend this film to all children between the ages of 6-106.

213,Larry_L_Peel,Bridge to Terabithia Leads to Movie Magic,9,29 July 2007,"Gabor Csupo, the Hungarian born animation wizard, brings his immense talent to the screen once again in his latest project Bridge to Terabithia, the big screen adaptation of Katherine Patterson's 1977 book. Csupo manages to do what few directors have managed in trying to adapt a classic book to film; he maintains the vision and the magic of the text. Bridge to Terabithia is a wonderful jaunt into the magic and mystery of the imagination of children, and an excellent family experience.In this Walden/Disney cooperative, Fifth grader Jesse Aaron's (Josh Hutcherson) hopes of becoming the fastest runner in his class are dashed when new girl Leslie Burke (AnnaSophia Robb) outruns everybody, including him. However, Jess and Leslie soon begin a friendship, and discover a magical kingdom in the forest, where the two of them reign together as king and queen. Both bullies and their parents, which are transformed within the magical kingdom that they create for themselves, embattle the pair.Through the artistic creativity of Weta Digital, the world of Leslie and Jess comes to life in ways that Patterson's book could not possibly have conjured. Brilliant creatures, an incredible tapestry of settings, and superb acting on the part of the young stars bring the story from the page to the screen in an immensely entertaining fashion. Csupo retained the intent that Patterson seemed to have had in her book; that friendship, not magic is the key to the tale. Csupo also makes sure to portray the fact that Jess in intimately in tune with and concerned about, his family's finances. This is a feeling that many in the films target demographic, 7-13 year-olds, can relate to in modern society.Following the tradition now firmly established by Narnia, Csupo strives for, and succeeds in, capturing the legacy, vision, and morality of the original tale. Csupo has long been involved in the behind the scenes magic of nearly two-dozen animated films and television series. Josh Hutcherson is no newcomer to the industry either with a nearly equal number of roles as his director has credits. In fact Josh is set to lead another family friendly contender this Spring with Firehouse Dog, set to open in March. AnnaSophia may be most familiar to audiences as the gum-smacking Violet Beauregarde in 2005's Charlie & the Chocolate Factory. Robb too has been busy in the industry, with 7 credits now behind her and 5 more completed or in post production.Disney has finally begun returning to its roots, revitalizing the 1960's family friendly, live action film. This film may appear to be a second rate Narnia copy, but it certainly has its own merits, and is well worth taking the kids or a date to.",Bridge to Terabithia

Her death causes the boy's mind to snap. Discovering he has developed a strange taste for watching the women in his life die, the psychotic boy immediately begins the process of luring his impressionable younger sister towards the Bridge to Terabithia, presumably in the hopes that she will drink deeply of the fast-flowing muddy water beneath.As a cautionary tale of what happens when you don't keep an eye on your children, this movie stands out.",Bridge to Terabithia
215,billybobwashere,Wonderful family fare that captures emotion better than many films do these days.,8,24 February 2007,"Boy, what a wonderful experience I just had.. It's not very common for great films to come out in the first couple months of the year, but Disney's latest is one of the most wonderful family films I've seen in quite some time.If there is any way I could briefly describe this film, I'm very surprised to find myself saying that it's basically a family-friendly version of ""Pan's Labyrinth."" In ""Pan's,"" Ofelia is a girl who escapes the troubles she faces in the real world by traveling into the woods and letting the magical world she discovers take her over. In this film, Jesse and Leslie escape the problems they face both at school and at home by traveling into the woods to a magical world where they are capable of anything.Like with ""Pan's Labyrinth,"" the viewer will probably be surprised by how the majority of the film takes place in the real world instead of in the fantasy world that you expected to see lots of. However, the scenes that involve reality truly are the most magical parts. Josh Hutcherson and Annasophia Robb may not get Oscar recognition in the near future, but their two personalities flood on screen and are very impressive for kids their age. They give very relatable performances as kids who want to know that there is more to the world than what they are forced to stare eye and eye with every day.The rest of the cast is wonderful as well, including some very nice performances from the other school kids (although the school scenes sometimes get too unrealistic as some things that happen at that school just don't happen in real life), Zooey Deschanel as the music teacher of Jesse and Leslie (you may remember her as the love interest of Will Ferrell in ""Elf""), as well as the four parents of these two children. Nothing here is close to extraordinary when you compare it to some of the performances that are competing at the Oscars this year, but for a family film they are definitely all the film needs.This film is not as good as ""Pan's Labyrinth,"" as that film really touched me more and had a more realistic touch when you consider the very unrealistic and fantasy plot, not to mention some of the fantastic performances from the cast, but this truly is better than many of the family movies out today (I can say without hesitation that this is much better fantasy family fare than the likes of recent films such as ""Eragon"" and ""Happily N'Ever After,"" two films that exploit action and comedy, respectively, to entertain the viewer). This film touches base with real emotions and has some moments that will at least make you teary-eyed. For a family film, it has some very serious plot material.There may be enjoyable family films that come out later in this year, such as ""Shrek the Third"" and ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,"" and I know that I'll definitely be seeing both of those movies. But if you want to see a film that truly moves you in the way that movies rarely do, ""Bridge to Terabithia"" is a film that you should not miss.A-",Bridge to Terabithia

I never watched the 2007 film until few days ago for the first time while visiting family. I knew how the story ended and it made me very sad as a child. I suspected the film was going to follow the same route and it did just this.The film starts off with this little boy Jess who does not have many friends and he is bullied by 2 bigger boys and a girl a few years older than him. His family does not care to much about him and his Dad is obsess with money and does not care much for art or pretend. One day a new girl turning out to be his neighbour meets and friends Jess as they go on playful evenings after school using their imaginations to pretend they are in a fantasy kingdom. The girl teaches Jess to use his imagination, and teaches him to be himself as well as even giving him a birthday gift of his dreams. Now if you read the book yes the film is exactly the same and the new girl who becomes Jess's best friend dies from falling into an overflowing river. The reason I gave this 3 stars is because of just how sad this film is because of this!I hate films where a child dies in the story. In a world where accidents happen I find its sad and wrong. Watching this film made me want to cry. And even several days after watching it, the film still makes me want to cry! To think this girl helped a friend who was struggling in his childhood and to think of the potential future they had lost together I find sad. Im sorry but if you prefer a happy ending I would not recommend this film. And for anyone over 18 out there the Terminator and Alien films were nicer than the ending of this film!

It dismays me to read the comments of viewers who feel that a film that deals honestly with such absolute realities of life in our world as bullying and death is not appropriate for children. Our children have to live with these things in their lives, and what better way to help them develop ways of understanding and coping than seeing others who come up with beautiful strategies for dealing with crisis and unhappiness? There is plenty of death and gore and violence of various kinds in films, even films meant for children, even animated films by Disney. But the unreality of many of these representations (or their callous representation of death and pain as laughable) renders them useless or offensive.

They feel and enjoy such a beautiful warmth in each others company that they live in their own magical world, carefree and with the freedom to imagine anything and live through with it !! Not all wonderful things in this world are ever lasting, their togetherness is no exception !!What follows is such a moving sequence of images that makes you enter into their world and shed a few tears for the loved ones !This movie is so honest and thanks to a skilled technician team !! No matter what .. Disney..

(im just kidding ...) cuz children may love it ... i loved it even though im 22 ... all my friends love it ...good performances by AnnaSophia Robb & Josh Hutcherson keeps the movie alive till it ends ... it even gave me this question of "" which parts of the movie u liked the most is it the real humans performances or the 3d animated part ?

The whole story touched my heart & I cried in the end :') Aside from the fictional world of Terabithia, the story mainly focuses friendship between the two kids & how one kid feels/reacts & later on cope up with the death of his dear friend. The story gets a suddenly a little bit too sad in the end but that's the main point of the movie, to tell from a child's perspective, how he doesn't understand why someone close to you die & that you can't do much about it than to move on. A star less because I felt like the movie became slow in the end but then again I haven't read the book. I just wished if they would've shown the fictional characters like the fairies & all more clearly in the end movie scene instead just showing them in the end credits :D",Bridge to Terabithia

The inevitable reality of adulthood that we all have to face eventually",Bridge to Terabithia
224,hand-eti,Loose ends.,8,19 September 2010,"This movie starts off as mediocre, slowly grows more interesting and then throws it all away. Things that are started don't end, things that end are never started. You're just screaming for the unexisting part 2 after seeing this movie.It starts as a typical high school drama about two kids who are bullied. All clichés are there, except it's in a rural setting, not in the city.But it gradually shifts to being a movie about a boy and a girl exploring a fantasy world where they battle trolls that are symbolic for their problems in real life, and thus learn to cope with them. In such a movie the last thing you're going to need is one of the two suddenly dying at two thirds in the movie. From that moment on, the whole magic of gaining strength through imagination, which was what made the film good, is gone, and we are left with some sort of lame tearjerker.If they wanted to make it really dramatic, they should have showed her death and give it a place in the movie. They didn't. He comes home and learns that she's dead, and that's it.Since the whole movie was about 2 kids growing up and conquering their fears together, you're simply not going to accept that she's really dead. You know she has somehow disappeared into this magical kingdom that's the realm of the two youths, and he'll have to go and rescue her. But that never happens. The film just end, while the viewer is waving at the screen: 'Hello, you forgot something! She's not really dead! He has to go and rescue her!' But no, he has not learned to stand up for himself and his friend and to be strong and brave and get her back - in the end of the story all he has learned, apparently, is to be nice to his little sister.Oh, and the scenes about the church and discussions about God sending her to hell or not have no place in this movie and should all have been left out.",Bridge to Terabithia
225,Blades891,Touching film that made this non-crier actually cry!,9,11 January 2008,"I read Bridge to Terabithia when I was in elementary school, so I honestly did not remember much about the plot or tragedy that occurs. However, working in a library and seeing the book almost daily on the shelf, as well as watching the trailer, got me interested in the story once again. I just watched it on TV a few days ago, and I have to say that I truly enjoyed it, more than I ever thought I would. Yes, knowing that a death was coming at one point may have aided in my positive view of the film. But when it actually happened, it was totally unexpected and really hit me hard. I rarely ever cry at movies, (maybe 2 at most ever), but this film actually made me cry. *Spoiler* Just when it seems like their bond is stronger than ever, (and where I thought Jess seemed to be falling for Leslie), tragedy strikes, which makes the impact that much deeper. I loved Josh Hutcherson and AnnaSophia Robb in this film as their friendship grows and they share this magical land together.As you probably know by now, there is an unexpected tragedy that would probably be difficult for younger children to understand and deal with. I advise parents preview the film before showing younger children. But don't write it off just because of this. This film is based on the book by Katherine Paterson, so the tragedy is necessary in keeping with the elements of the book's plot. But I think it's a wonderful film for more mature children and it brings important values and messages to light in a very compelling way.",Bridge to Terabithia

The relationship between the little boy and girl was beautiful until they decided that, for no apparent reason, she should die. Why ?? My daughter sobbed uninterruptedly for the rest of the film and it really ruined it. I was very disappointed and I feel this twist has totally ruined the film and gives no reviewing pleasure either, so forget the DVD. I find the producer to be utterly irresponsible filmmakers.

I got a little bit tired of Harry Poter and I was happy when I saw this movie.... but this is different.....Yes, it is adventure and fantasy... but that's not the point of the movie! It's much more about friendship, having someone and loosing someone.... and trying to keep someone in your heart no matter what happens... to be lucky at least for the past moments spent with someone.... Maybe this movie will be a bit hard for kids... Maybe you should watch it first before you decide to watch it with your kid.... In some moments movie is really sad and it shows that life isn't fair... And no matter what we won't... destiny is something else!

This movie has the arrogance to claim to be an imaginative lovely story and its ridiculous - it was made to make money. The lion the witch and the wardrobe books were written for bereaved children in the war, and of course the big shot Americans of Hollywood assume it wont offend anyone to purely copy the storyline of a classic. Also, may i just add that next time Hollywood wants to rip off the general public they might want to hire some children that weren't sent directly from the Disney channel. It's embarrassing. This movie is Hollywood to the point where it's actually quite funny. Original? Try again.",Bridge to Terabithia

Obviously, this movie is intended for younger audiences, but I enjoy any movie with adolescent protagonists that is made well. Both lead actors were experienced and convincing. The adult parts were a little underdeveloped, but kids do not go to these types of movies for character development or the adult actors for that matter. The plot was simple but believable, and the dialogue was surprisingly intelligent at times. I was able to handle the fantasy in the book, because this story took a lot more realistic approach than movies like Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings. The movie as a whole was enjoyable for me, because of the mild social issues involved. I am interested, though, in a child's perspective of the movie, because the action was minimal and plot was the dominant driving force.",Bridge to Terabithia

It's fun, smart, warm and tragic at the same time just as life is ;) Good cast, all the kids were great and realistic. All of the school scenes were very familiar. Don't expect to see a lot of CGI here (i've heard people talking right after the screening, that it doesn't look like fairytale because you don't get to see dwarfs or elfs every once in a while...) after all it's a movie about using your imagination,and that's the best thing about the movie.

233,MonkeyVooDoo,Amazing (for Disney),9,6 March 2008,"Let me start off with a story. I rented this DVD, because my girlfriend had wanted to see it. Towards the end of the movie, my girlfriend looks up at me, and notices me crying (this is the first time this has happened) and she asked me why I was crying, to which I responded I didn't know. Now this is not the first movie I had cried when I watched (Shawshank Redemption was the first), but it is most certainly the first I have cried like a baby in. This movie was stunning, the actors portrayed their roles perfectly and the storyline was timeless, and the emotion you feel when you watch it, is unmatched by many movies. I was amazed that Disney didn't change the ending to make it more child friendly, but I am glad they didn't, it would have ruined the message that the story teaches. Though, I tried to watch the movie again, after I bought the DVD, and it just didn't have the same effect on me (maybe because I was expecting it?) But, I felt this movie was my absolute favorite of 2007, yes you had the late year hits (No Country and There Will Be Blood), but they were not as touching as this movie (not even close). I wish this movie got some Oscar nominations, but, sadly, children's movies rarely do well with the Academy ( minus Ratatouille) If you have not seen this movie, see it. If you do not want to watch this movie, watch it. If you love character development at its best, see this movie. If you hate Disney for its happy endings, see this movie.",Bridge to Terabithia

This movie is a perfect choice for a boring afternoon or when you are frustrated with your life. Even if you know the plot, this movie is repeatable once in a while.The three lead caste of the movie-Josh Hutcherson, Annasophia Robb and Bailee Madison remind everyone of their childhood and one could feel what we were by watching the movie. The movie shows friendship at the best and what friends are meant for.

235,MovieHistorian,"Predictable, depressing, and cliché.",1,11 April 2010,"While the acting in this was superb, the story and ending were Predictable, depressing, and cliché.The advertising for this film was very, very misleading, and if I knew it was about a child experiencing death at a young age, I would have skipped it.About 25 min after being introduced to ""Leslie"", I thought hmmmm, I bet after she teaches her friend ""Jess"", how to enjoy life, etc, she dies.Whadya know, unfortunately, I was right.This film reminded me of ""My Girl"" with a bit of ""Narnia"" thrown in.People pass away, including kids, but I don't wan't to go to a fantasy movie to see death.There is more than enough of that in real life.For many, movies sometimes are a way to escape the rough parts of life. Sad movies can and do, have a place in cinema. While this film had some very nice moments and great acting, the story used the same ""formula"" as many other films do. Happy, happy, characters become close, one of them dies, the one who doesn't learns a lesson and moves on.No thanks...",Bridge to Terabithia

But, it took my only a few hours, and I had months to wait. Today, February 16th, I saw it, and I have a few things all of you might want to know. This movie is very kid friendly, if you are very concerned about what your kids see, then, this might be good. There are a few imaginary ""scary"" figures, but it's not like a horror movie. The actors did so wonderfully well, it scares me. Josh Hutcherson and AnnaSophia were always favorites of mine, but they surprised me anyway. They played the roles well. It teaches you a lesson, also, and it shows some how to use an imagination. I thought this movie was marvelous, and it deserves to be watched by millions.

237,sweper74,a celebration to childhood,8,13 November 2007,"Before i watched this movie i thought it was gonna be a plain ""Fantasy"" about children finding a secret entrance to a secret world, sort of. I have not read the book that it is based on, neither did I study the story enough before either, so i have to blame myself for that misjudgment. As a result of that, I was initially pretty bored of the movie, the first half of it.... Before i understood what it was about. I Judged it as a pretty silly ""i have seen this before""-movie. But......I am so glad i continued to watch it to the end!!! This movie is no Fantasy!! (though I like Fantasy movies too). It IS a movie about childhood, life, about friendship, to dare to be ourself, to live our life now before we die, before our dearest die. It is a movie about completely letting out and free your imagination, so that we feel alive and free. It is also a family drama, about raising up children overall and attending school. There is a sad event coming up also that you will discover in the second half of the movie (you will understand when you see it). But you will never be frightened, more touched and blessed (not of the event itself of course). But because the second half of the movie helps you understand the first half. It is a beautiful movie. I found myself crying a bit in the second half of the movie, which happens not that often these days, and i am a man! in the early 30 years he he. I can't really compare it to some other movies, the closest maybe should be ""Stand by Me (1986)"" or ""What Dreams May Come (1998)"" But still not really the same thing but has the deepness of them in common. I highly recommend it. The movie has a ""(View content advisory for parents)"" so read that before you start the movie.",Bridge to Terabithia

It's also a movie about dealing with the realities of life; that first school-boy 'crush', being part of the household and having to do chores, realizing that your parents may be going thru difficulties of their own. The actors playing the main roles are a bit older than than the children they play, but play them well-probably from their own experiences.

I've been looking forward to seeing this since last year when I heard they were making the book into a movie! I read the book back in 4th or 5th grade but I found the book quite boring. There were two movies that my friends and I wanted to see. We decided to see this instead of Epic Movie and we were glad that we made the right choice! The trailer was indeed VERY MISLEADING! My friends thought this was going to be like a Narnia movie. There was a scene where Jesse looked like he was flying as he climbed up a tree with Leslie. My friends thought he gained magical powers. This film was also rated 'G' where I live so the theatre was packed with families, parents and a lot of little kids. When Jesse arrives from his trip to the art museum, my friend and I, who already read the book in 5th grade, were like, ""This is it! This is the part where they're going to reveal that Leslie died!"" I wanted to see the reactions of my other friends, who haven't read the book yet but I wasn't able to because for some reason, I was drawn so much to the scene that I forgot to look! During Leslie's wake, the tears started coming. But I didn't want to cry so I held them back. At the part when Jesse heard his name being called in the woods, one child started screaming ""Leslie! Leslie!"" It was nice to know that besides my friends and I, so many other people had also fallen in love with the characters. Of course, (to those who has seen this movie), we know it was Maybelle calling Jesse's name, and not Leslie although we are made to think that it is Leslie as we see the movie through the eyes of Jesse. Just when everyone thought the heavy part was over, more heavy parts! Jesse pushing Maybelle, Maybelle crying, Jesse being chased by the ""dark master"", Jesse crying in the woods and bulding the bridge! All heartbreaking and heartwarming scenes! I seldom cry in the movies and the friends I'm with do not cry at the movies at all! So far, only this and Adam Sandler's Click have made me do that. This movie truly is a gem! Praises to all the actors and actresses! They did a great job! Annasophia Robb was great as Leslie and Josh Hutcherson was an awesome Jesse! He's acting made me want to go into the movie screen and give the poor kid a hug! Bailee Madison is SO adorable!!! Her talent is twice her size! Kudos to all the supporting cast as well and everyone involved in the movie! This is one of the few movies that touched me among so many others!

I haven't read the book but there are areas of this movie that annoy me.The death of the young girl Lesley reduced this film's appeal and frankly just stopped the whole concept dead (no pun intended). It was dragged on and there was just no point to her death.The school teachers role was lame and gave no real essence to the story.The boy depression was just over and over again throughout the movie, making this bland and unimaginative, There is no magic to this film whatsoever.

245,SuperNewb,Great; *IF* you know what to expect,10,19 February 2007,"Based on the heartbreaking book, BRIDGE TO TERABITHIA strays from the regular family film, while still delivering a strong message.Two words you must remember before seeing this movie, though: FALSE ADVERTISING.Terabithia is NOT another Narnia by any means. It is advertised that way, but it is not what it seems to be. For book fans, however, Terabithia is a great adaption.The acting is amazing; Josh Hutcherson (Little Manhattan) pulls his part off excellently. Josh is one of the best male child stars of this generation, without a doubt. Annasophia Robb (Charlie and the Chocolate Factory) stars in yet another Walden Media film, and, despite her disappointing performance in Because of Winn-Dixie, she gives a great performance. She is able to captivate Leslie's innocence and free-spirited nature without becoming annoying or obnoxious. Putting aside the two wonderful leads, another star shines; The puppy-faced Bailee Madison. Her smile lights up the screen and she is cute without getting on your nerves. She steals every scene she has a line in. The other children and the adults, again, are great and this is what truly makes the movie move along.The moral? Many worried parents seem to have the wrong idea of this movie. I can understand why, but you must look beyond the obvious. This movie does not just make us realize what reality is, but it shows us love, friendship, and courage. It teaches us how to stand up to our enemies and how to make friends; How to love, and how to deal with the issues of everyday life. The movie shows us that love comes in every shape, size, and way, and that a true bond cannot be broken, despite road blocks. The ones you love are always with you.And, with ending this, I will put a quote that most people have heard, but it truly fits this movie; Fairy tales are more than real: Not because they tell us that dragons exist, but that dragons can be defeated.",Bridge to Terabithia

There were a few very Disney moments, where the sentimentality was strong, but I think that's what people like about Disney. It was also a sad story (I had vague flashbacks to being a kid and watching Where The Redfern Grows), so I kept looking at our young companion, but she was draped horizontally in her chair, eyes narrowed and apparently barely awake. She later said she was ""bored"" while my friend and I agreed we liked it a lot, that the child actors were terrific.

Not only was she his best friend, but she was better than all the other girls at his school: she was pretty, adventurous, and kind hearted, and stood out. In the end, her death taught the little boy to be responsible and be kind and include others. Even his little sister.What I really liked about this movie was the scenery. It looked like where I grew up in southern Australia (eventhough technically Bridge to Terabitha was filmed in New Zealand). It also reminded me of how my friends and I used to play in the vacant lot.This movie was more of a tear jerker than a fantasy flick, but it still kindled some warm emotions in me, so it is a good tear jerker.",Bridge to Terabithia
249,MistyMovies,Not what I expected...,7,4 March 2007,"Please keep in mind one thing before reading my review on this movie: I have not read the book - so I knew nothing about the story going into it. And although I have to say that this was a very entertaining movie and I enjoyed it very much, I was upset to find out that the movie had a very sad part to it. *SPOILER* Since I had not read the book I had no idea that one of the characters die in the story... I had no idea that there was any sad part to this movie at all. Needless to say it completely threw me. I didn't expect to go into that movie and come out with red eyes... But I did enjoy the storyline. Another *SPOILER* though, there is not a lot of visual effects in this movie like the trailer makes you think that there is and that disappointed me. I was hoping for a lot of thrills ... but it was a very loving story and that much I was impressed about. It brought some memories back to me of how Jr. High was for me... I was picked on a lot and it was not any fun. All in all, the imagination used in the movie was a wonderful screenplay. I enjoyed it. I would think that this movie would be good for anyone from the ages of 7 to 14...",Bridge to Terabithia
250,JAB-13,Finally a movie which touches your heart!,10,17 February 2007,This is best movie I have seen this year. The story is wonderful and sticks to the basic storyline of the book. It has been updated to the current time from the '70's. The fantasy parts have been embellished. The cgi effects are very good and only add to the story. This is one time that if you love the book you will love the movie and vise versa. AnnaSophia Robb practically stills the movie in her portrayal of Leslie Burke. AnnaSophia also sings one of the songs in the movie and does a great job. She is not only the bright spot in the Jesse Aarons life but also the movie.The other actors do a great job especially Zooey Deschanel as the music teacher and Bailee Madison as May Belle Aarons - the little sister to Jesse Aarons. These actors are going places. Robert Patrick did a great job as Jesse's father.It would be nice to see more of these type movies made. Many of the Newberry Award Winning books have been made into great movies and this is the latest.The story is very good because it touches the human heart; this is something that many movies are lacking today. This was Walt Disney's philosophy about his movies and that is why he made so many hit movies.,Bridge to Terabithia
251,How-Now-Brown-Cow,An outstanding and spellbinding piece of cinema,10,20 October 2007,"I went to see this with a friend, and when I went I wasn't expecting much. From the trailer it looked like the usual Harry Potter, Narnia book adaptation that seems to dominate the film industry these days. But I was very wrong indeed. I came out of the cinema feeling deeply touched.Firstly there is the fact that I can relate to this film so much. I am like Jess in that I love drawing, especially animals and faeries, and that I like running and I'm quite fast. I am also like Leslie in that I have an active imagination and am really good at English and story writing. When I was at primary school I did get bullied a bit by the older kids about the fact I wear glasses. I would often get very upset and hurt. So to see most of my personality portrayed on screen really got to me. I am 14 years old and, even though many say it's a kid's film, the film has become my favourite and has taken up a special place in my heart. And, thanks to that film, I'll never look at my rope swing in quite the same way again.Then there's the film itself. The acting is sheer quality, and I thought both the young stars did a fantastic job. The imagination behind the film is ingenious: turning Scott Hoager, one of the school bullies, into a creature called a squogre (part troll, part Scott Hoager), is to me a brilliant idea. The way they use the sound of jangling keys with the Dark Master to represent Jesse's dad is also a nice touch.So you can probably see why I rated this film 10/10. This film will remain with me forever and I will always remember it.",Bridge to Terabithia

It' truly amazing how it has been done, both talking about scenery and special effects but also storyline and most importantly the cast. Actors were brilliant, loved them, they really did the part. Josh was awesome, Annasophia also was awesome and the little girl, can't remember her name, by the way the little sister, was awesome too especially considering her age.I basically ended up crying in the last part of the movie, really because of the strong message it give. It is not one movie for just kids, it is one great story i advice to everyone, didn't see such great movies in a long time. And i really ended up with some great thoughts i will surely keep in mind and share",Bridge to Terabithia

Through the entire length of the film your eye is treated to more and more magical sights, until you reach the end of the film which is like the finale of a great 4th of July fireworks show. For a young teen or younger, this film is a hit, but no matter what your age if you are not moved near the end then your heart is not beating. The kids in this movie do a great job, and not just for kids. Many pre-teens can relate with this film, and older kids can open their minds and remember back to what their childhood was like. Overall this is a worth watching film, especially if you can manage to watch it in High Definition.

If you have thoughts of seeing this, please make sure you find someone to help you understand what it's about first. I don't think kids would enjoy it at all. I think it would either make them sad or they wouldn't understand it. It seems whimsical and fantasy, but that's all made up. It's really sad. Sad sad sad. Please don't waste your money on this unless you want a good cry over something really sad. If this movie made any money it was because nobody knew what they were really going to see.

256,I_wont_say_im_in_LUV,Keep your mind wide open...,9,9 January 2008,"So my kid brother comes up to me one day and tells me they're making a movie out of ""the really cool book"" he'd read in English class. Having read the book as a child, I remember ""Bridge to Terabithia"" as one in a category of great lands and letting your imagination run wild. Tough to be put into a movie though, without overkilling. My first question, who plays Jesse Aarons? Seeing Josh Hutcherson in Zathura and RV, I didn't think he could pull it off. And Charlie and the Chocolate Factory's Violet Beauregarde as Leslie? Sheesh! What were they thinking? I gotta admit I was pretty wrong. Both the main characters are played extremely well in this touching story. Josh Hutcherson plays well into the only brother of four sisters, the ignored one, the one with the hand-me-downs, the bullied one at school, the great, great artist. And AnnaSophia Robb is spectacular with her warm smile and sweet voice. And May Belle! She kinda blew me away with how mature she was with her acting, I know I've seen her somewhere before, I just can't place it. The relationship between May Belle and Jess is also one to cherish, the kind between a kid sister and her brother where she thinks he's the single greatest person in the world, I can totally relate to that! ""Bridge to Terabithia"" is a really sweet family movie, a kind you don't find anymore. It blends a perfect plot with likable characters, excellent direction and a heart-warming story that can touch your soul... Not your ordinary Disney cliché movie. Its definitely worth a watch!",Bridge to Terabithia

Love, the love between two friends. The real beauty of this film comes from the innocence and power of a child's imagination. To create a world in your mind so detailed it seems real. I am not a Josh Hutcherson fan, but I do thinks he does wonderfully in this movie. AnnaSophia Robb is wonderful as Leslie, the outsider the weirdo who befriends Jesse(Hutcherson) and with him creates the magical world of Teribithia. She is the true soul of this kingdom. She affects everyone she meets and by the end of this movie, you wish you knew her in real life.

Also it is amazing how many people either loved or hated this movie. In my mind the writer or the producer could've made the ending much much better and they could've focused more on the magical land of Tarabithia. You don't see much about Tarabithians in the movie till the end, who they are, what they are. There's no character in Tarabithia that you like and get attached to. Also what was the point in the poor girl dying and what was up with the boys reaction the next day when he went to the breakfast table and ate pancakes?!?!? The movie made no sense and didn't flow well at all. The ending was terrible as sin, at least they could've brought the poor girl back as a spirit or something!!!! I don't know who or why anyone would rate this movie an 8,9, or a 10???

259,chrysalis_reborn,Not what I would call a kids fantasy movie,3,19 February 2007,"Okay...I rated this movie low, in spite of the fact that it was very well done. The problem is, the trailer is NOTHING like what the movie was really about. My kids and I spent probably the first 20 minutes waiting for something to happen. Finally it became obvious that this movie was NOT a fantasy movie as was depicted in the trailers. Definitely not for little kids, maybe for older kids. For what it was, it was well done. For what you expected it to be, it was a total wash out.Neither I nor my kids had read the book. And, at least for me, having seen the movie, I wouldn't bother to read the book (I am 46, but I read quite a bit and don't feel that reading ""children's books"" is beneath me from time to time.) I already know life sucks and is a royal PITA, I don't need either a book or a movie to remind me of it or help me get down in there and wallow in it. I read or go to the movies to be entertained, to escape from life for a little bit, not to be reminded of how crappy it can be.My kids didn't cry, but they did think it was sad and I expect they were disappointed. Heck, we probably should have gone to see Ghost Rider instead, in spite of it's PG-13 rating. At least we would have known what to expect.",Bridge to Terabithia

There are magical scenes in this film (all of it are just the character's imagination) however virtually it is riding a bus, singing songs inside the classroom, family and of course Terabithia. Terabithia is the place where our two heroes hangout to pretend it is another world filled with magical creatures (the cgi is quite good I say). The problem with this film is that a big chunk of it is boring. Yet the theme is contemporary with today's issues on friendship and struggles in life. The way this movie ends actually moved me emotionally I could actually feel it, the pain of loss. That is what this film intended to do with its audience. Nice.",Bridge to Terabithia

262,pilothouseman,Thoughtful film for anyone,8,11 July 2007,"I thought this was going to be a (dull) fantasy epic like Narnia but it was much more interesting. Like other good fantasy movies, (Wizard of Oz, Time Bandits) the fantasy world is linked to the real world and serves a purpose in it. 98% of the film is real world, 2% fantasy. Basically its a story about how some kids learn to successfully deal with the often harsh realities of life and how they teach others to do the same. Thats what ""play"" is. I enjoyed watching their friendship develop over the course of the daily routine of bus rides, school room struggles, home realities, and play in Terabithia. Some IMDb reviewers complained that it wasn't a 'kids movie' and others complained that there was no sexual element between the boy and the girl. This only illustrates that much of the movie-watching public and movie producers are total morons. I like this movie because it defied the widespread assumption that movies starring kids should be witless and meaningless and watched only by children. Also the assumption that movies starring adults should be sexual, violent, witless, meaningless and watched only by adults. This mentality is demonstrated by the fact that the word ""adult"" often equals ""pornographic"" and is also reflected in ratings systems which are usually age based. As if to say that an arbitrary level of sex and violence is right for a 17-year-old but wrong for a 14-year-old. Age based ratings systems are more about masking conscience than protecting children. And protecting them from what anyway? Their parents? The society they live in? Adults? I'm straying from the movie now but the is one more point I want to make. Children are, and have always been entertained by watching adults and adults are and have always been entertained by watching children. If you want to see some really good movies with kids and at the other end of the spectrum from the American movie industry, check out Iranian director Majid Majidi.",Bridge to Terabithia

I was able to use the movie as springboard with my oldest grandchild to discuss the theme of friendship and "" spoiler alert"" how to cope with the death of a young friend.It is not your usual Disney movie. An adult friend who came with us, was not happy with the movie and did not think that Disney should have made this movie.

264,greasemeyer,"If you're considering this film because you liked Narnia and Lord of the Rings, don't go for it!",2,24 July 2007,"And two thumbs down for Bridge to Terebithia! I bought the movie because I enjoyed ""The Chronicles of Narnia"" and I thought that Bridge to Terabithia would be somewhat like it. Not in the least. Even though the Actors and special effects were good, (which were the only things that got my 2 stars) the language, rude humor, disrespect to elders, false teachings about God and the Bible, and the... oh my goodness, extremely sad ending. I mean, Jess' best friend Leslie Drowning!?!? We don't even see her again! And the media calls this movie a ""great family movie!?"" yeah, only if you want to pollute your family with language and rude humor and have them crying at the end of the film! I came close to crying like the rest of my family, but I was so disgusted with the film that I couldn't. It just wasn't that sad for me. Another thing that really caused my rating for the film to go down was this ""magical"" land wasn't magical at all, only powered by imagination. Narnia and the Lord of the Rings had real lands in the books, not imaginary lands like Terabithia! So, Disney, and whoever is the Author of the Book, Better luck next time!",Bridge to Terabithia

To enter the world of Terabithia they must cross over a river while swinging on a rope. While at Terabithia they fight the dark master's creatures.

266,fallonsoleilb,Easily One Of The Best Movies Ever,10,19 April 2008,"Those who walked into the theater for Bridge To Terabithia probably expected what they saw in the trailers, which was some version of The Chronicles of Narnia. Instead, however, they got one of the most beautiful films ever made. Bridge To Terabithia is in all respects a kid's movie, but it isn't the kind where nothing that has a resounding impact on the characters or the plot. Those movies are very kind, and don't introduce any real-life topics. This particular film is a mixture. It has fantasy creatures, which makes Terabithia even more enjoyable for the audience as well as Jess and Leslie. But it also introduces to the viewers a harsh fact of life. Death. Leslie dies. I'm sorry. This may seem a little much for a children's film, but it just shows the younger people of the audience that life is not always so gracious and that it can be snatched from anyone at any moment. There are hints. They're just very subtle. It is very heart-wrenching when you follow these lovable characters throughout the movie, and then Leslie, who you saw running around the day before, is suddenly gone, just like that. This is why so many audience members (including myself and my friends) were reduced to or nearly reduced to tears. Leslie's death, of course, leaves Jess heartbroken. But this brings in another topic: denial, anger, bargaining (or guilt), depression, and acceptance. In short, the five stages of grief. Jess goes through these. At first he refuses to believe Leslie's dead, then he becomes angry that she went and left him. After this it is implied that he feels like he could have saved her (as he weeps in his father's arms) if he had stayed behind from his field trip and been with her. The depression stage is Jess finally breaking down and crying in Terabithia over his friend, for whom Jess probably felt more than friendship. Maybe a kind of love. But in the end, Jess learns to accept it. He won't get over it right away (if at all), but he learns to accept it in the end. This is shown when Jess makes Leslie a little funeral boat and lets it float away in the stream where she died.Long story short, a beautiful masterpiece. Buy the DVD, read the book, whatever. Just make contact with this story in some way. I guarantee you will enjoy it whether you're 9 or 90.",Bridge to Terabithia
267,maxxx-1,This is no children's story. This is a serious drama.,3,4 March 2011,"I watched this, expecting the usual ""magical fantasy land"", like Narnia or Neverending Story. I expected an enchanting, lightweight, properly told fairytale. Instead, it turned out to be a very much adult drama, realistic to a fault, to which no usual ""proper storytelling"" mechanisms apply.The story starts off as any young teen friendship novel: boy goes to school, boy is bullied, boy meets girl, girl has no friends and neither does he, boy and girl team up. And this is where the classic story lines usually begin: either one of the duo has problems that the other helps them overcome, or something happens that sends our heroes into a magical world, or magic starts to blend with reality, cue well-known ""believe and you'll make fantasy a reality"" mechanisms...Sorry, none of that in Terabithia. None whatsoever. Welcome to a story about a magical land without any magic to it.Here come massive spoilers.The fantasy land stays a fantasy land and never serves any purpose other than allowing oneself to fantasize. Fantastic dangers are just a game and everyone involved knows that. Trying to get back at bullies, foreshadowed by humorous finding a tree troll's weak spot, ends up in non-funny ruining their school lives. Trying to befriend bullies, in turn, digs up some dirt that is ""fixed"" in a mind-bogglingly bad way (a girl beaten by her father so much that neighbours call the police is given ""wise friendly advice"" to pretend that everything is fine). Allowing himself to get invited on a field trip results in the hero not only getting scolded, but the heroine dying all of a sudden because she went to the ""fantasy area"" alone. The boy dreams of being the fastest runner, but is only really fast in the fantasy land, school races cease to matter after the first one. The boy's artistic talent never finds any use other than getting him praised by his music teacher. The only person that ever really enjoys the fantasy land is the boy's younger sister, who's been little more than a nuisance so far.If you ask me, none of the usual plot elements are tied together to form any coherent plot. Sure, you can cut out a realistic ""slice of life"" of a handful of persons, let important things be forgotten, let little details or accidents change everything, distribute wins and losses unevenly, break off story lines, introduce new events totally out of the blue, just like in real life - but then you don't get a plot for a children's story; you get an adult drama.Perhaps the whole movie was tragically mismarketed? Perhaps it was supposed to be a soft-core Tideland, but the whole magical land concept got over-sweetened and school life sequences turned it too much into a children's story which it initially wasn't to be?All in all, if you want to expose your kid to deceivingly lighthearted but actually serious drama, it's your call, but the life lessons given by this movie are not very good ones. And if you want to see a fairytale, stay away from this booby trap of a movie.",Bridge to Terabithia

But no, this movie is NOT a fantasy-like movie at all.It is really hard to write a review on this movie. I believe most here already said about the false advertising for this movie on Disney's part, so I'll leave that out and move onto the other point.This movie is an attempt to build a bridge (literally) between fantasy world and the harsh reality of a teenager life. I think there are still some jagged edge that can do with some polishing in parts that try to glue those 2 worlds together. Nevertheless, it did a good job overall.I have to say that this movie left me with a concoction of mixed and complex feeling. I feel happiness, sadness, regret, awe, disappointedness, marvel and a whole lot more are all meshed up into a single pulp deep in my heart. It a sense, it is a dark movie, as it deals with death; but on the other sense it is a heartwarming movie where it depicts the wandering mind of a young teenager. It is very hard to name another film that left me with such a mixed up feeling.I think this movie would only be suitable to those who are above 15 years old. It has quite a mature theme, so don't bring your kids to watch this movie, unless you tell them what to expect in advance.",Bridge to Terabithia

I had a certain picture in my mind of the characters and how the story played out, and seeing the amount of CGI in the trailers, I figured the story had been mutilated to include the fantasy world in the same vein as the Narnia novels. I did not want to see a great story butchered, and I thought I would despise this movie, based on what I saw in the trailers. Well, too often trailers don't do their films justice. I did watch it, the story wasn't butchered, and I thought it was great! The characters weren't quite the way I pictured them of course, but the cast was excellent, and they captured the essence of the characters. I haven't read the book in a long time, but all the important plot points seemed to be present from what I remembered. And I was so happy to see that the CGI was used just enough to enhance the fantasy world of Jess and Leslie and not dominate the film.Like the book, the film has real heart, and it turned out to be one of the best adaptations of a beloved book I have seen.",Bridge to Terabithia
270,broken_bat,Unbelievable and Unexpectedly So,9,13 March 2007,"My family went to see the movie without me the first time and then my 14-year old sister convinced me to take her again. I couldn't believe, based on the commercials, that it was a movie worth seeing twice. Was I ever wrong.This movie encompasses all that childhood is and should be for everyone. It offers friendship and bullying, it shows imagination and as well as the more realistic sides of life, and it shows true compassion for others, which after childhood, few retain.Yes, the trailer paints a different portrait of this movie than what you get when you go to the theater, but I think that is a bonus. Children can handle a lot more than we give them credit. In the theater, there was a girl who couldn't have been more than 4 or 5 years old and she was bawling her eyes out (not unlike myself). Afterwards, the girl was applauding with delight. My point is, the movie rating explicitly warns against the peril of this movie, and if, as a parent, you don't want to subject your child to the unpleasantries of ""real life"" at the risk of dehumanizing them, then don't take them to see this movie. However, if you want your children to experience what true imagination and great friendship has the potential to create and what true love can withstand, then please, take them to see this movie.Or better yet, buy the book and read it with them.

As a father I understand the father in the movie. Loving your children is not always easy. The makers did a good job in showing this. Also there is the imagination of kids that can build worlds we cannot see, but since we all were kids, I hope we remember how it used to be.

And we have the obligatory Drew Barrymore-a-like kid who is sweet and not too annoying. The effects are adequate rather than exceptional, though this isn't really a criticism as this is meant to be more of a human interest movie, and the effects are meant to represent the children's imagination rather than an alternate reality. The death of one of the leads is a genuine shocker, and you did feel for the bereft Jesse. Maybe I and my friends are a little too old and cynical to truly enjoy this film...",Bridge to Terabithia
274,alice-authorbooks-ogorma,Strange and Puzzling,3,18 October 2014,"When I saw the trailer (or at least a poster) for the film, when this came out, I thought it wasn't my type. Fast forward six/seven years and I hear it's actually not as fantasy as it sounds. Ironically, when I was the age the movie came out, emotional dramas were all I saw.Well,let's see. Josh Hutcherson and AnnaSophia Robb are good actors,really good for about preteen, young teen and they seem to have had a bit of success.But seriously? Let me explain exactly how awful this was. I heard about a guy who took his three daughters (can't remember their ages,but the oldest was younger than the main characters) to see the movie. It was the first weekend he had them after an awful divorce.The movie is slightly slow in the first parts, but something that doesn't make sense is when Jess is in class and Leslie is describing her 'Self-Contained Underwear Breathing Apparatus' he sees hand-drawn pictures of bubbles and sea creatures. The opening credits also show that style. But the rest of the movie is terrible CGI.What is incredible is how many people enjoyed the movie despite all the plot twists. I know some of them may have been fans of the original book, but to watch it, see a lad of kids inside the cinema crying, then call the film a work of art?",Bridge to Terabithia

I just don't know how to appreciate this movie more!! One important part of this movie which made it so easy to relate to myself at the age of 10, was the idea of creating an imaginary world. It was thought out and executed very well. Also this movie shows you how talented our Peeta of the hunger games is and was from a very young age. yes there are moments when his acting is a bit off but its almost unnoticeable.Just one warning, the movie has some intense and emotional moments which are quite touching. Still if you're in the mood of watching something sweet then this is the movie for you.",Bridge to Terabithia
276,banapaulo,Fundamentally flawed non-fantasy film with questionable messages,5,3 August 2008,"The problem with this movie... no, wait, the problems with this movie, are numerous. I never saw the trailer and was fully aware this movie had something traumatic happen half way through: that is not the reason for my anger at it.Killing a main character half way through is not genius, or clever writing, or dealing with important issues. It's just exploitative, a cheap trick to give the movie emotional weight where there previously was none. But the problem is deeper than that. You can't kill off a main character and then have the other character deal with it by escaping into their imaginary world. That's basically telling kids - who this is most definitely marketed for - that this is an acceptable way to deal with grief. This is not a movie to show kids if you want them to understand death, it's one to avoid at all costs.This problem is further muddled by the way fantasy is represented in the film, which is to have dodgy CGI creatures appear whenever the two characters start imagining stuff. It doesn't make much sense for us, as the audience, to see their (somehow collective) imagination randomly appear in the middle of a very real forest. Films like Narnia understand you can have a fantasy world and the real world, but there's a barrier between them. You can't muddle them up like this on film, unless you're Terry Gilliam and the film is Brazil.And then there's the quietly disturbing subplot involving the teacher, whom Jess has a crush on, and goes on a field trip with - ALONE (seriously, what the hell?) - which is the indirect cause of Leslie dying. It's just so badly thought out and impossible to engage with.This is not a bad movie so much as it is a seriously flawed one. There are good moments and the acting is fine, but it's a badly realised concept, atrociously marketed and with a more than questionable way of introducing death and grief into a seemingly light-hearted film.Don't let young kids see it, especially without someone to explain it to them.",Bridge to Terabithia

I will defend this film to the end, saying that those who felt misled by the previews are at fault for not doing there research. I have never in my life seen a film based on commercials and trailers alone. I do my research, and try my best to not stumble across spoilers. That being said, I had never read the book (until after seeing the film), and knew the film was in the imagination of the lead characters, not to be mistaken for 'Narnia' or ""LOTR' films. All of that out of the way, this film is filled with love, human connections, and imagination. Even though this movie deals with death/loss, it is important for children to be able to talk about this with their parents. Death is death with in an appropriate way (we do not see the death, Jess goes through the different stages of loss), and we see what positive things can come of it. I have seen the film 2 times, and have never cried more at a film. Why? AnnaSophia Robb created such a beautiful and special character in her Leslie Burke, that the audience cannot help but be as heartbroken as Jess.

I did however notice every child in the theater was riveted to the screen especially during the more dramatic parts. A must see for tweenies and teens, oh and us adults who enjoy a great movie.The photography was perfect in all respects, which accented the acting and the story in perfect harmony. I can not find a bad thing to say about this movie, which is refreshing to say. The casting was awesome and believable. The directing was perfect. It is nice to see a director who does not get lost in techno babble/silly ""Only funny on set"" pranks"" and maintains continuity with the important things that make the story work.

281,RedPixel,This film IS for children despite what others may have said here.,10,26 October 2007,"I watched this film knowing beforehand there was going to be a death. But i had no idea who or how. I wasn't sure what i was expecting from it. I noticed in the small amount of advertising that i saw, a fantasy element but perhaps like some of the other reviews i had not been taken in too much with this.The film deals with many aspects of childhood. The thing i liked about this was that although it is a Disney film, it didn't fall prey to being too over sentimental when dealing with the issues presented. I am 32 and a big fan of the fantasy genre and i know that as a child i would have loved this film just as much as i do as an adult. The characters are very well fleshed out and you become to feel very close to them, identifying with them and their struggles with their school and home lives.The actors are superb, all the children in the film, from the lead players to the bullies are very believable and real.To say this isn't a film for children is very unfair. People can sometimes not give them the credit they deserve, this film doesn't molly-coddle or pamper to the idyll. Children are much more capable of processing emotions then perhaps a lot of adults as they do not yet have the filters to distort tragedy as we do. They see things as they are and feel things in a very real sense. I think that this was brought across very well in this film.Jess' bereavement was beautifully portrayed with sensitivity and realism. Anyone who has lost a loved one will identify in the grief process Jess has to face. Yes, it is somewhat 'speeded up', it had to be otherwise the film would have had to go on for months! The death itself i felt was incredibly effective as it is so sudden. You genuinely feel shock and incredulity, even denial when Jess is told of Lesley's accident. This is in many cases how death happens. Most of the time we are not prepared for it, even after a long illness, we are never ready to accept when a loved one is taken from us before their time. The following scenes in which Jess comes to realise Lesley is really gone are real and moving. At the end of the film, Jess begins to find acceptance in what has happened, the final stage of the grieving process. We are left feeling that Jess will be OK, that he has learned so much from his experience and that he will keep Lesley with him in some way for the rest of his life. It ends in a very positive way, which is not a bad message for children.Yes, very small children will have trouble understanding the emotions, but i do not believe it does harm to show them a film with so much love and friendship in it.A beautiful film. I will have to read the book now!",Bridge to Terabithia
282,stephenbooth,"Banal, give it a wide berth",1,10 April 2008,"This film was recommended to me by my sister, I can only conclude that she wants me to suffer.The scenery is quite nice, but a bit over familiar for the many other films set in back of beyond USA, and the two lead kids are engaging for the first 10 minutes or so but rapidly become samey.Beyond that it's same-old same-old generic stereotypes recycled one more time. Sensitive artistic boy, check. Smartalecy tom boy girl, check. Spoiled brat younger sibling, check. School bully who has a rough home life, check. Distant verging on abusive parents, check. It's been done before and far better. Indeed a big reason why it's been done better before is that it's been set in high school or college before, rather than what appears to be junior high or middle school here, so there's been more opportunity for variety in the script.My sister said she was crying at the end.

284,Nez-Alpha,Story over effects.,7,24 April 2007,"When I sat down to watch Bridge to Terabithia, I did not know quite what to expect. From what I had seen in the trailers, I thought the movie would be about two kids that end up in some magical world, similar to the Chronicles of Narnia (clearly, I did not read the book). Needless to say that I was surprised when actually seeing the movie. I shall not spoil the story for those who have yet to see the movie, but I will say that, in my opinion, this movie is for a more mature audience than one would think. Rather than being a fairytale for youngsters, the movie actually gives the viewer an inside look in a young boy's life and all the troubles he faces, concerning school, family and friends. The setting overall was a lot darker than expected as well. I can be short about the acting. The child-stars that play the lead roles did a great job and really brought the characters to life. On this subject I must give some credit to the director as well, as it is very difficult to work with children and to get them to play the part exactly the way you want them too. One final aspect of the movie that deserves mentioning is the fact that it does not lean on special effects. Although there is a fair amount of nice CGI present in the film, the story dominates. Which in my opinion, is a lot better than the other way around. Overall, I found the movie very enjoyable, but I would advise parents of young children to find out more about the movie, before deciding on whether or not you'll let your kids watch it.",Bridge to Terabithia
285,wiseman1024-1,The worst movie I watched in a long time,1,8 September 2007,"Bridge to Terabithia is a short, terrible movie. You expect a fantasy/adventure movie, much like Narnia, but it's neither. The fantasy is nonsense, and the adventure is nonexistent. This movie was marketed as an adventure movie but it's clearly not so. It's more like a cheap drama, and that would be doing it too much honour. The setting is somewhat good, and the characters definitely are, but development is slow and when you think it'll start to get good, it ends. This movie is so awful it's one of these times you wonder if your DVD was broken and you were missing the good half of it. I wouldn't recommend it to anybody.",Bridge to Terabithia

What makes them so great is that the children are taken seriously. But I like Terabithia best. Some people here expected a movie like Narnia, full of CGI. So they didn't like it. Others thought it was unsuitable for young kids, because it's too sad. That's what I don't understand. Yes, it's about a boy that looses a friend. That happens. My father died when I was 8 and we moved to another town. Tragedy and loss are part of life. This movie is about loss, but also about love and how to deal with grieve. Children will understand it, especially when parents talk to their children about loss and grieve. But some people prefer to constantly escape from reality and treat their children accordingly. This story is made in a great tradition of the old fairy tales, long before Disney distorted them with happy endings. The old, mostly European, fairy tales were sometimes gruesome and might make you feel sad, but they told a story and prepared for the things that were going to happen in everyones live. So it's surprising that Disney made this movie. Maybe something is changing there.",Bridge to Terabithia

But as it progressed...it became all the more interesting. In fact, at some points i lost track of whats real and whats the kids' imagination :).

288,monsoon_11,I loved this movie!,10,18 December 2008,"I can't even write of how amazing Bridge to Terabithia is, so I will attempt. Before I saw this film, I never had read the book, so I was actually expecting a corny fantasy flick. I was proved wrong.The story is about a young artist named Jess living in a financially struggling family, Then comes Leslie, a funky, free spirited new girl who becomes best friends with Jess. Together, they create a magical kingdom in the forest on the other side of the creek, and the only entrance to it is to swing on a rope across the creek.The movie is very emotional. I don't usually cry at movies or t.v. shows, but in this movie, I cried like a baby. The main themes are dealing with loss, so parents, be wary.I was pleasantly surprised that it didn't turn out to be a Narnia styled fantasy movie like the previews and trailers made it seem to look like, it would have ruined the whole sensitive story. The actors did a beautiful job in this movie. Josh Hutcherson did an amazing job, his emotions and reactions to things made the movie more realistic, and when he gave the monologue about him being the reason Leslie died, I just broke down crying. AnnaSophia Robb blew me away as the imaginative and trendy Leslie, she perfectly portrayed her. And I loved her outfits.

289,clueless_man16,"Watch it three times, then once a year",10,27 December 2009,"I say that because if you buy this movie, in a way, you're spoiling it's effect. The story carries a message best received when well distanced in frequency, and you begin to take it for granted after you hoard it all in by watching it week after week. This goes for all ages (unless you have a toddler who will give you hell if you don't put it in the DVD player, which is highly likely). Watch it two or three times upon buying or renting it, and from then on, watch it once a year, perhaps as a New Year Tradition.I was up in my room with the portable player and I popped this in. Expecting a movie similar to Narnia, I wasn't prepared for this. In fact, the first quarter made me say, ""C'mon, get to it!"". The TV ads were so illusive. They his the heart that this movie held, and I was blown away to th point of tears. I'm a 15 year old guy, by the way. if you think I'm, like, gay or something, well, believe what you will. See the movie first, Is my suggestion. The two kid actors, AnnaSophia Robb ( hey, the girl from Because of Winn-Dixie!) and Josh Hutcherson ( C'mon, Josh, make another movie, blast it!) were spectacular. Not showy, but natural. Kids you might find next door. Take a look into the personal lives of their characters and we see something better than Narnia: Real life. The end had me practically bawling in disbelief.

And her chemistry with Josh Hutcherson (Jesse Aarons)is great: his silence brings you into his mind and transmits his feeling to you quite well.I have English as a second language, and so far I've watched the movie three times, two in English and one in Spanish: I prefer original sound, however I recognize that this film's Spanish language dubbing was well done.

Nope, that was false advertising. If for whatever reason you enjoy seeing a depressed child's best friend die, in a failuresauce way, then this movie is for you.

292,passthepopcorn6,Incredibly Poorly Done...on the Advertising,9,9 July 2007,"As a huge fan of the book by Katherine Paterson, I put off watching this movie as long as possible. I was APPALLED by the trailers--trolls and CGI running amok--and swore it off as a terrible box office-aimed manipulation of a beloved book. I could not be more wrong. I don't write reviews for the IMDb very often, but I couldn't resist on this one.I read the book as a young child and was deeply affected by it. For the longest time, Leslie was my hero for her courage, her individuality, and most of all for her amazing imagination. I admired all this in her even at seven years old. Even though I was skeptical at the hip and trendy little blond girl I saw in previews, Anna Sophia Robb does not disappoint. She and Josh Hutcherson give beautiful and convincing portrayals of two children who only wish to escape reality for a while (only to have it catch up to them too soon). There is one particular moment that comes to mind, when Jesse is watching Leslie laugh and walk home in the rain--I almost lost it. It was perfect. You really grow to care about Jesse and Leslie.As for the CGI you see so much of in those terribly misleading and disgustingly money driven previews...don't go into this expecting a wardrobe and an army of centaurs, as apparently so many people did. This CGI (which I wouldn't call top-notch or realistic, but was respectably well done) appears in brief, scattered scenes probably making up around 25% of the movie or less. It serves not to create a fantasy/adventure thriller, but rather to glean glimpses into the imagination of these two kids. I can only compare it to a certain scene in Finding Neverland, when Neverland as a part of the characters' imaginations comes to life. Take that scene, add more CGI and take out some of the artistic-license-y-ness, and you have this.I truly wasn't expecting to cry during this movie--I didn't even cry during the book. But seeing Jesse cope with the painful reality he has to face was absolutely beautifully handled. It was so exact and so heart wrenching. This is the part where I have to warn you that very small children may not be able to handle the difficult message this film has about loss. Jesse had to learn at a young age, but many children may be unable to deal with what they seen on the screen. I would advise parents to only bring children ages seven or eight and up. That said, everyone over the age of eight should see this, and DEFINITELY should read the book.(My one gripe about the book to film adaptation was Leslie's wardrobe. I hope I'm not the only one who found it COMPLETELY out of character. But that's another argument entirely) Don't come into this film looking for epic CGI battles reminiscent of the Chronicles of Narnia or Harry Potter. You'll leave with something even greater.",Bridge to Terabithia

I was absolutely enthralled by the novel, and found myself crying at the end, the first time a work of fiction had made me cry. The magic and wonder of the book stuck with me the past decade, so you can imagine my excitement when I found out it was being turned into a movie!I went in with high expectations and was not in any way disappointed. The movie version of Bridge was incredibly true to the book, and the young actors portraying Leslie and Jess did a fantastic job. One of my favorite parts was Zooey Deschenal as the music teacher, the way she got the kids singing those songs was fabulous, those scenes were my favorites. They were so well done, with the children looking like they truly cared about what they were singing, putting all their feeling into it.The most powerful aspect of the film was the portrayal of the imagination children possess. My friends and I found ourselves crying when Jess finally ""kept his mind wide open"" as Leslie suggested, and saw Terabithia for the first time. It broke my heart to realize that, at 18, I no longer possess the imagination and creativity that Jess and Leslie did at their young age.Terabithia was shown as the perfect escape mechanism for the two kids, to get away from their bullies and family troubles. It was amazing how their fantasy world, where they were a brave King and Queen, gave them the courage to stand up to their bullies.The moment Jess found out he was going to the museum with his teacher, I broke down, because I knew what was coming. When Jess' father breaks the new of Leslie's death, your heart all but breaks. The scenes that follow can be very difficult to watch, particularly when the kids are next shown in music class, singing a mournful sort of tune very sadly, Jess with his head on his desk, fighting back tears.The movies wraps up beautifully with Jess bringing his ever-present little sister Maybel to Terabithia, having finally built a bridge into he and Leslie's secret kingdom. He tells her she is the princess, and that her subjects, the Terabithians, were all very excited to see her.The whole movie was so powerful, and has a devastating effect on those of us who miss the innocence of childhood, when all one needed to have a good time was the head on their shoulders.10 out of 10.",Bridge to Terabithia

The Book Bridge to Terabithia was originally a work of children's literature written by Katherine Paterson, In 1985 a (60 min) TV Version was produced, Now In 2007, a film with the same name, based upon the book, has been released. The Story...... It tells the story of fifth grader Jesse Aarons, who loses a race to the new girl Leslie Burkeher, the two lonely children befriend each other & create a magical forest kingdom. My Thoughts......... I am usually not the emotional person in the cinema, but i must say this one got to me, i liked the fantasy mixed in with a storyline that anyone who felt a bit out at school could relate to. It is probably like combining bits of My Girl and Narnia together if i can say that. This movie has some good Principles for kids today and shows us that, no matter how old, we are we can still have an imagination and look to the brighter things in life.",Bridge to Terabithia
303,max-787,Actually a Pretty Uplifting Movie,8,25 February 2007,"I'm amazed at some of the other users who panned this. Maybe they were just looking for cheap entertainment, and were put off by having to actually pay attention. Yes, it's true that this movie is not your average Disney feature. No, that does not mean young kids shouldn't see it. If they're prepared for an unhappy ending, it might actually help them to understand what life actually is (not what you usually see in the movies).The movie is, as you should know, is based on a wonderful children's/ adult book by Katherine Patterson about how Jess, the main character, is introduced to a whole new life philosophy by oddball Leslie. They invent an imagined land called Terabithia, of which they are king and queen. Terabithia helps them cope with a school full of bullies and especially helps Jess with dealing with his father. The whole plot was very true to the book; I flinched, however, at some of the obvious clichés that I had been hoping not to see. Examples: 1. Leslie and family dancing around their house to rock music. 2. Music swells (and swells, and swells) at the finish and the camera zooms slowly in on Jess's face.But despite these problems I really enjoyed the movie. The acting was great, and I even got teary – eyed when, SPOILER! SPOILER!, Leslie dies at the end. The book touched me, and so did this movie.Go see this movie. For the first time in a long time, a movie has been made for people of all ages.8/10",Bridge to Terabithia
304,prolink007,A great story of a friendship,8,25 June 2007,"This Story is nothing like what i gathered from previews. From the previews i figured it was going to be a movie about adventure, fantasy and some peril. But... although the movie had this in it... it was not completely just an adventure.The movie has some great acting in it! Josh Hutcherson did a great job. I can see this kid doing a lot more movies. Some of his scenes where he acted confused were so great. lol. And AnnaSphia! Wow! Words can't describe how great of a job she done. She is a pretty good singer too. She has a bright future. I believe the cast of characters were perfect and the plot and character development were right on! This movie is well put together. And there is a lot for the viewers imagination to dwell on. There are so many different stories in this movie. Almost anyone can relate to someone in the movie. It really draws you in and makes you feel the pain and happiness of each character. Everyone did a great job on this movie. I can't remember one scene in the movie where i said to myself ""i believe they could have done something different"". This is a must see movie, for anyone of any age. It IS NOT just for children. Although... because it was so sad and moving... i may not be seeing it again. lol.It is a great movie, but REALLY REALLY sad. I warn you right now... carry a box of towels. Thats right... towels.

In the beginning you see how hard it is for weak persons to go to school every day. Then you see the friendship that grows between Jess and Jessy!! It's so romantic nevertheless that they never kiss. You can feel the romantic vibes between the two. Also the end is magnificent, because it's so original that nobody can suspect something like that. And I must be honest, this movie is not for children under the 13, because otherwise you don't get the meaning of the whole movie. Little do the people know that this movie is a great masterpiece with great young & old actors...I give you one piece of advice.....go see the fuc**** movie, because his damn good!!!

306,davidcinnella,"if seeing from a particular point of view it's... well, read and you'll see what I mean...",10,18 December 2008,"Have you ever stopped your daily routine for a moment in your daily activity, forgetting all the worries and troubles of sustaining a family or commissioning your work by the next day, and recalling the days where you where just a kid? If you lived the farm life like a hillbilly before getting your dream job in the big city then you can recall the smell of nature, the touch of grass, the sweat on your brow after a whole day of playing around, having fun getting dirty after playing with your dog, chasing a small animal for fun or just climbing trees alone or with your friends. If you lived in the city then you might recall the days when you could go to the park and still have fun getting your clothes dirty or staying with your friends playing catch and robbers, hide and seek or just making up stories. Either way, even if you have become a cold hearted and stone faced figure, no matter how much you deny it you can't hide the fact from yourself that you had such experiences too. How did you feel in those days? You felt free, happy, like you could do anything you wanted, protected from the world. It's maybe one of the most precious thing anyone will ever have before entering the cruelty of the world, something that can help us keep going on with our lives, appreciate things more and be satisfied more instead of aiming always for power without ever being satisfied. It's the most precious feeling of anyone's childhood, and whoever denies it to a child is automatically considered a cruel monster by all means... besides, it's too good a feeling to forget and must be reminded in our daily lives ever y now and then. ""Bridge to Terabithia"" is one of those few opportunities that anyone can have to remember those blissful days of freedom while on HellEarth. It's simplicity may be considered a bit childish to some, and perhaps rightfully so, but the feeling of friendship, of a strong connection and understanding between a boy and a girl and to how they use their imagination to escape from a sad world is one of the purest things of them all. Saying that this is a bad story would be exactly like saying that Peter Pan is a bad story. What is it about? It's about children who attempt to escape the real life into a world where they are supreme, where they can be free, and most importantly where they can have a feeling of protection that nothing else can reproduce for them in return. And in the process, they also learn valuable lesson on life and friendship. Besides, this movie shouldn't be taken too lightly. I am not going to reveal anything, but along with childness, special effects, good acting, hearty characters, etc. there is also a great sense of drama. The first time I saw this movie at the cinema was with a friend of mine a year and a half ago. We had seen the trailer beforehand and expected a new ""Narnia"" movie. Instead, we where brought not only to a new world, but to a new level of fantasy that was in perfect balance between the greatly imaginative and the real world with great gentleness and tenderness, something that is found extremely rarely in a movie, book or any other media. I recommend this movie to anyone, literally anyone, for there's a bit of everything in it... even big drama with a huge surprise element for the older folk. The character Jess, and especially the lovable Lesley, will teach you the importance of life and simpleness in life like no other philosopher has ever done before. Watch this movie, and prepare to be transported to a world that can exist only in your own mind. But to do so... remember always, no matter what, to ""keep your mind wide open""!

308,martyaxwar,"flat, forgettable, forced, uninspired emotion-bait",4,29 September 2015,"Well... what is the movies focus? Imagination, friendship, originality, emotion and loss... and Juicy Fruit chewing gum.Since that's the thematic focus, let us analyze this on it's own terms.Imagination: Everything in this film is generic. Generic fantasy treated with pathos, stolen from pretty much everything that's been done before. No original features or interactions. Just the big shining letters IMAAAAAGINAAAAATION, branded on every scene.Friendship: Everything in this movie is over-dramatized. The character's aren't very believable (and they are terribly acted) most of the time, so you don't really get to connect with them. The movie is very unfocused, which can be a good thing, but in this case it just means that the friendship aspect is kind of not fully realized. Which is a bummer, since this is a movie about two friends. I just didn't buy into the emotions.Originality: IMAAAAAAAAGINAAAAAAATION! No.Emotion: Hutcherson's performance is very flat and emotionless, with the exception of the last part of the movie. Robb's performance is artificial and over-enthusiastic. Everything just tries too hard to ENCHAAAAANT you with IMAAAAAGINAAAAATION. The emotion doesn't really work until...Loss: The theme of loss is treated quite well. That and...Juicy Fruit chewing gum.All in all, it's a terrible movie, but you can make worse, when it comes to kids movies.Very forgettable.",Bridge to Terabithia

A nice movie about families and the issues they're facing, about school relationships and, most important, about the parents - kids relationships. During the movie, I intended to give it an 8, because of the story, the characters, the great casting. But I have finally decided on a 7. Why? Because of the tears that were provoked by Leslie's finish (I preferred to use this word, instead of another). Let's expand this subject a little. Ever since I've became a parent, I am very sensitive to all the things that might happen to kids. If Leslie would have just suffered an accident, but she'd been alive, I would have taken my kid to the movie. But the story is extremely sad, and I can't see this movie again, and I won't let my family see this tragedy. Leslie's character was so strong and alive, that I can not figure it another way.

This lonely, ostracized boy finally finds a friend, with whom he invents a way to cope with the daily heartache of ten year old life, only to lose her, ironically, via the bridge that inspired the fantasy land that made it all possible? Was the author TRYING to torture children? Or perhaps she was trying to make them afraid of ever doing anything on their own, for fear that their best friend might DIE if they don't bring her along on every single outing. (I know, I know. She wrote the book for her son, whose best friend died. How this story made him feel better about it is beyond me.) Forgive me, but I feel that movies and books for children should show peril and frightful scenes; however, in the end, everything should turn out OK. These are kids. Kids need to feel safe and secure.

It is about two kids, fighting with their lives, trying to make them something...different. Like all of us, I suppose. But the way they're doing it is amazing.

I have never heard of the book before so for me was a totally new story I knew nothing about but what the movie trailer was showing. According to it I expected to see something about a fantasy world with fantastic creatures and adventures somewhat similar to Chronicles Of Narnia. I was disappointed to see that all those wonderful images shown in the trailer were pretty much all there was in the movie itself as well. That is about 5 to 10 minutes from a total of 1.5 hours of movie.On top of that the girl's death took me totally by surprise and I found myself in the situation where instead a nice fantastic story for a 6 year old girl to be faced with a very real and tragic life story.Don't get me wrong, the movie was very well done and it is a very good one but in my opinion not for kids younger than 10 years old. Fortunately my daughter took the moment very well and when I asked her if she liked it she told me yes but a yes that was also hiding a little disappointment.I think that every parent should be warned about this movie.",Bridge to Terabithia
313,luckylib14,Terabithia is As Real As It Gets- Not a Typical Disney Movie,10,17 February 2007,"Both of my brothers had read this book, and I had heard such great things about it from them. One of my brothers is an amazing artist, and I am an aspiring writer. It meant a lot to me that the characters were artistic as well. Going into the movie, I already knew the plot but did not know the ending, and because I love and have a great bond with both brothers I trusted their opinions on the book and hoped the film would be what the book was in comparison.I was blown away. I thought that Disney would put an annoying stereotype on the characters, but the acting was more than excellent and both the children and adults were not fake in the slightest. It was a very true performance.The main character, Jesse, is a troubled boy who is part of a financially struggling family and who also gets picked on roughly in school. The day he wants to show up to all of the guys that bully him by beating them in a race during recess, the new girl in class, Leslie, beats all of the boys in the race. Leslie is unafraid to do anything unconventional, and is a beautiful writer with an imagination as open as the sky. But while the other kids bully her and see nothing in her writing but yawns, Jesse sees the true vision she has and admires her. Jesse, an aspiring artist, draws things he sees in his mind, but needs a helpful nudge from Leslie to bring his imagination and emotions to life. Now, take note that the advertisements are completely misleading- they do NOT make their imaginations actually come to life, and it is clearly just their imagination that makes all these magical creatures (the bad ones funnily enough resembling the bullies from their school) and things appear. Together, they are the king and queen of Terabithia, an imaginary world they create together as an escape from the harsh reality at school that is one rope swing over a creek to another side of the forest. It is ""their place"".This film is a reminder of childhood, and is a tear-jerker because of the tragedy in the end. There is a deep care between the characters that grows and never becomes cheesy. The acting done by the boy who plays Jesse is phenomenal, as well as the girl who plays the ever-inventive Leslie. The film really shows how one person can change your life and how you view it. I highly recommend this to children and adults alike, as this is a truly inspiring, truly REAL movie.",Bridge to Terabithia
314,imdb-10148,Wonderful Movie That Brings Life To The Screen,10,27 February 2007,"While I haven't read the book, the drama in this movie evidently means I should read it. My son is reading it in school and by request of his teacher we went to see the movie. I was drawn into the movie from the start and contrary to the ads, this movie is less about a magical land and more about life.Beware that the movie draws you in to the greatest moments of a little boy's difficult life. You actually begin to identify with him and watch as his new found friend patches the boy's life back together. Just when the movie has you by full grasp it happens. I won't say what, but I will say take a box of tissues or prepare for a wet sleeve. If you go with the open mind of a child you will not be disappointed.The movie had nothing that caused me to worry about a child watching. But any child watching the movie must be prepared for the full impact of life and death. You get the full psychological dip. Not a movie for the severely depressed. Everyone else should see it.",Bridge to Terabithia
315,michaelmross,Packs emotional power in a Disney wrapper,8,1 March 2007,"If a movie can make you weep, this is the one. Having said that, I realize that more than most movies, the way you experience this story will absolutely depend on your expectations. Fortunately, I had none: it was just another take-it-or-leave-it movie I was taking my children to. I knew nothing about the story beforehand, and the surprise factor is key. Without that surprise, I doubt the emotional punch would be nearly as great. My 5th grader had read the book and didn't cry - nor did his younger brother, who hadn't. So this is a movie that moves adults and lets children confront some difficulty realities. It is a very well observed honest portrayal of youth - although I thought that Jessie and Leslie appeared a little older than 6th graders. However, after creating a wholly satisfying, moving, movie experience, the last 2 minutes of fantasy glitz, like a cheap sugar coating, left me irritated and annoyed that Disney could not refrain for once. My son said the film does have an ending in the spirit of the book, but we both agreed that the ""Wizard of Oz"" closing scene was over the top and quite unnecessary. But despite that, the difficult subject and emotional power of the movie make it worthwhile and notable. Few adult films I can think of can compete with this portrayal of love and loss.",Bridge to Terabithia

I never heard of it until then! I don't read a whole lot, so my wife and I rented the DVD from Blockbuster and all I can say is it was very good but very sad!! It might be a good idea to have a kid watch this with an parent so that they can answer any questions that the child might have because it is very sad, and because of some bullying and some peril! It might even be a good idea for a child to watch this to teach them that bad things do happen, even to a child! I am not going to say anything more because I don't want to spoil the movie for anyone! Saddest movie I've seen since Old Yeller, best family/children's movie I've seen since The Never Ending Story, and the best children's friendship movie I've seen ever, the friendship is very convincing between the main characters Annasophia Robb and Josh Hutcherson and both did very well!

It was largely faithful to the book (which I wouldn't have known from seeing the trailers!), although I think the main character may have had a different relationship with his little sister in the movie. The movie also made the same choice about how to depict Leslie's death that the book did, which was not to show it directly, which I thought added to the authenticity of the movie -- almost everything was shown from Jesse's point of view.The computer graphics are mostly good, except for the very end scene where they seem maybe a little rushed? Something about them just looked like 80s or 90s level graphics, although there are some imaginative pieces that were nice.Overall, definitely a great show for kids (with the caveat that a movie with a main character dying might be a little too sad for some children), and quite good for grown-ups, too.",Bridge to Terabithia

Unfortunately, I must play the hypocrite and say that I wish I hadn't been subjected to seeing the pain and loss following the loss of a best friend. It just happens to be a sore spot for me. I can watch horror movies, gore movies, slasher flicks and they don't bother me - sometimes they amuse me. But seeing a movie about the loss of a friend or pet, just destroys me. Anyway, the child actors did really well and I was especially impressed with blond girl who had a very Pippy Longstockings thing going on. The production quality was a little below par, but that's not really what makes a movie. The content and characters matter most, and you certainly get those here.",Bridge to Terabithia
319,cg35,Hey fellow IMDb reviewers: Get a life!,6,12 March 2007,"99% of these comments fall into either of these two categories:1. OMG, NOT FOR KIDS! Somebody dies! Attack on Christianity! Not like the trailer! 2. This is the best movie ever!In reality it is somewhere in between. To the haters, realize this movie is really about young adolescence NOT childhood. They two are very different stages in life. What boy of 12 or 13 hasn't had a killer crush on some 20-something woman? I know I did. What boy of 12 or 13 hasn't felt the weight of adult responsibility starting to tug on him and escaped through fantasy? I know I did. What group of children HASN'T had the discussion, away from parents, about the fear of eternal damnation? You are lying if you say you didn't. Remember when girls were tall, and seemed to be full of confidence, while we were still short and lacking it? I do. All these things are fairly normal parts of early adolescence, as are whisperings of parental abuse, and confronting issues of death.All the above does NOT mean that this movie had some agenda to push on children at the expense of their parents. If anything you should be thankful for being reminded of what being that age is about... maybe it will help you talk to your kids. Two of my friends died when I was a teenager... One of my son's schoolmates was killed by a falling tree a few years back. Death is part of life and we can't shelter children from that fact. This movie provided a good prompting for that issue and others. On the other hand, this is not a cinematic masterpiece either. It is just a nice little movie. I brought my 13 year old son, and we both enjoyed it as a way to pass a Sunday afternoon. It provided some nice issues for further discussion, but neither of us are gushing about it. I gave it a 6 because it fell right in the middle - not really a great movie, but certainly not awful.

When I saw previews of this version, I immediately dismissed it as a stereotypical kids' movie, with too many special effects that would stray it from the book. But my sixteen-year-old cousin, my grandmother, and my mother got me to go see it anyway in the Dollar Movie yesterday. All I can say is....THIS MOVIE WAS AMAZING. It was funny and dramatic at the same time and even people who'd seen it before were crying at all the right times. My mother was in tears throughout the entire last third of the movie!

321,EricPC5150,Great adaptation of a beloved book!,10,16 April 2007,"Bridge To Terabithia was my favorite book as a kid - I first read it over 25 years ago. It was an amazing, haunting, sad, and powerful story of friendship and loss. It's still one of my favorite books as both an adult and a writer. It has since become a modern classic of children's literature, a book beloved by children and adults alike. It's also one of the most controversial children's books of all time - one of the most banned and challenged.But I never expected it to be made into a feature film. I assumed that the mediocre made-for-TV version would be the only film adaptation made of Bridge To Terabithia, due to its difficult themes. I was absolutely shocked to learn that Disney's Walden Media division was making a feature film. I envisioned a bubblegum monstrosity having almost nothing to do with the book on which it was based.I was never more happy to be wrong in my life! This is a wonderful adaptation of Bridge To Terabithia and very faithful to Katherine Paterson's beautiful, heartbreaking story. That's because the movie was co-produced and co-written by David Paterson, whose real-life childhood tragedy inspired his mother to write the book.Fifth-grader Jess Aarons (Josh Hutcherson) is a poor, introverted, but artistically gifted farm boy living in rural Virginia. He has four sisters. His two older sisters despise him and his younger sisters worship him. With money so tight, Jess's emotionally distant, foul-tempered father spends most of his time working out of town.The only bright spot in Jess's life is his pretty, hip music teacher, Miss Edmunds (Zooey Deschanel), who admires Jess' talent for drawing and encourages him to try and realize his dream of becoming an artist. Jess has a huge, secret crush on her.Jess has no friends, but he hopes to win his peers' admiration by becoming the fastest kid in the fifth grade and winning the big race at recess. Jess is shocked when a new classmate - a girl named Leslie Burke (Annasophia Robb) - decides to join in the boys' race. She ends up beating him and embarrassing him in front of the other boys. That's no way to start a friendship, but soon, Jess and Leslie become inseparable best friends.Leslie is the complete opposite of Jess - she's bright, outgoing, and a fierce nonconformist. She's also creative like Jess - a natural storyteller with a vast imagination. Together, Leslie and Jess create Terabithia, a secret imaginary kingdom in the forest, where they rule as king and queen. It becomes a sanctuary for them, where they are safe from ridicule, the real-life school bullies that persecute them, and the imaginary monsters that Leslie dreams up.To Jess, Leslie is more than just his best friend. She's his soulmate and his reason for living. She took a poor, awkward farm boy and made him a king. For the first time in his life, Jess feels good about himself. With Leslie by his side, he's invincible. She also teaches him important life lessons, like being compassionate to those in need - even if you don't like them.Then suddenly, a terrible, unimaginable tragedy takes Leslie away from Jess forever. Devastated and nearly crushed by the weight of his grief, Jess must summon all the strength Leslie gave him in order to cope with his loss and make the magic of Terabithia - and Leslie's memory - live on.This is one of the all-time great tearjerkers, a story of great emotional depth and power. So bring lots of Kleenex. I'm a grown man now, and I've read the book many times, but I still tear up at the end. The movie is just as powerful, and Josh Hutcherson's superb, emotional performance will melt even the hardest of hearts. Annasophia Robb is magnificent as Leslie. She literally becomes the apotheosis of the character.The supporting cast is excellent as well, especially Robert Patrick as Jess' father - a role that's a far cry from the witty tough guys he usually plays.Beautifully and sensitively directed by animator Gabor Csupo in his first live-action film, Bridge To Terabithia also features a soaring, gorgeous soundtrack by Aaron Zigman. As I said before, the script, by David Paterson and Jeff Stockwell, is very faithful to the book and captures all the emotion of the story. However, I must say that some key scenes of character development in the book are either not in the script, have been changed, or are woefully underdeveloped.If you haven't read the book, I wholeheartedly encourage you to read it after you see the movie. Some fans of the book may complain about the changes and omissions, but I've been a fan for over 25 years, and I think that this is a first-rate adaptation of Bridge To Terabithia.",Bridge to Terabithia

323,x_LiveItUp_x,Not what I expected...but not great either,4,18 February 2007,"Let me first start off by saying that I have read Bridge To Terabithia. I was in fourth grade and loved it. The book is a story about friendship and loss. It was beautifully written, but so easy to destroy if some producers decided to make a movie out of it. They could create romance between Leslie and Jesse. They could do a numerous amount of things that would make fans of the book not want to see the movie.When I saw the trailer, I literally thought, ""Okay, did these people read the book or did they only hear about a made up world called Terabithia and decided to run away with it?"" Fans of the book, you don't have to worry about Bridge To Terabithia becoming a fantasy adventure. The people who create the trailers didn't do their job too well. They might have thought that by adding fantasy into the trailers would make younger kids want to see it. Well, they screwed up. Not only did it make fans of the book stay away from it, when others went to see a movie that they expected to be fantasy, they were sorely disappointed. The fantasy creatures are only what the two children, Leslie and Jesse are imagining in their made up world. They *don't* have to ""save Terabithia"" from these monsters, as one trailer claimed. Don't believe the trailers.The movie itself is about two children who appear to be in the fifth grade. Jesse Aarons is somewhat of a country boy. He has four sisters and his family is having financial trouble.He doesn't always get along with his dad or his sisters. He is the fastest runner in his grade, but gets picked on by bullies and has a jerk for a teacher-but a nice music teacher.Enter Leslie Burke, a young, pretty, unique girl whose parents write fantasy novels for a living. She has a great imagination and a close family (she's an only child). Leslie also gets picked on bullies for being different. She and her family move in a house that is close to Jesse's. She replaces Jesse as the fastest runner, which, in a way, brings them together. To escape the problems of the outside world, they find a place that only they know about, and that only they can cross-by swinging on an old rope over the river. Once they are across, they are in Terabithia, a forest filled with trolls and creatures of Light and Darkness from their imagination. Over the course of the movie, problems arise, but Leslie and Jesse deal with them and continue to come back to Terabithia. Until one day, after a lot of rain, Leslie tries to cross over into Teribithia without Jesse. The rope swing snaps, Leslie hits her head, and drowns. I'll leave the rest open.Problems that I had with this movie seem to be never ending. Hutcherson (who plays Jesse) had on-off acting. Sometimes he was decent, other times...not so much. Robb (who plays Leslie) was much better, in my opinion. Madison (who plays May Belle was actually very good considering her age.I would have liked Ms. Edmonds to have had a bigger role, and a bigger impact on Jesse. It seemed like she wasn't that important.The dialog was very shaky at times. Especially the bullies' insults, which were supposed to make you feel sympathy for the kid being teased, just made me laugh. It was stupid. No other word for it. Some of the conversations between Jesse and Leslie seemed unrealistic as well.This movie didn't really have any lesson to it. We don't really learn about death or how to cope with it. The only thing I got out of this movie was from my friend Maria who was sitting next to me. At some point during the movie, she laughed out loud, and the popcorn she was eating almost went out her nose. The only thing I learned from this movie was, ""Popcorn feels *really* weird coming out your nose."" A bit of wisdom that I didn't really need to know about.The one thing that really got to me was the scenes of Leslie and Jesse running through the woods together, playing and having fun with their imaginations. I know that sounds cheesy, but five years ago I was doing that too, and Bridge To Terabithia made me want to go grab my brother and sister and play with them in the backyard. It really did bring back heartfelt memories. That, and the reason I was prejudiced against this movie even before I saw it is the reason I gave it four stars.Don't go see this movie in theaters. Fans of the book, you might want to give it a try. Maybe. It actually does stay pretty true to it. Rent the movie if you're bored. Maybe you'll like it more than I did.-Sarah",Bridge to Terabithia
324,michaels-8,What a deceiving trailer!!,2,25 June 2007,From the trailer it had all the trappings of looking like an amazing fantasy filled world. What a joke! It was all over the place and any sense of fantasy appeared very late into the movie. Some people have said it's depressing - I do agree - it's a depressing waste of time. The casting was all over the place too. The boy's father was better suited to one of the Stepfather horror movies for a start. I can't tell you how much I was looking forward to this movie based on the trailer and how lack lusture I felt the outcome was. For a fantasy film there was far too much reality we only see a tiny bit of Terabithia at the end. It certainly didn't stack up as a major feature film release.,Bridge to Terabithia

327,electrictoothsyndrome,Overdone? But Still Good Somehow?,7,29 October 2007,"Just watched this movie last night with my wife (who fell asleep halfway through).The problem I had with Bridge to Terabithia, besides the fact that I was able to predict Leslie's death after the first 30 minutes as well as other major plot twists like the bully's redemption, was that Leslie's character was FAR too smart for a child of her age, and there were too many little incidents that would never happen to young kids in America.For instance: the bus driver would NEVER kick a kid off the bus simply because another accused them of tripping them. The parents of each of the main characters were too stereotypical and the contrast between the ""ultra-liberal"" and ""ultra-conservative"" parents is a bit overplayed and oversimplified. The contrast between the homes, even down to set design and lighting, was almost too stark to be believable. Couple this with Leslie's encyclopedic vocabulary and genius IQ and you start to verge dangerously close to losing the audience's suspension of disbelief.However, all this said, Leslie's character was so endearing and the greater truths she seemed to represent about the power of dreams were enough to bring me to tears anyway when her death did (predictably) arrive. For this, I feel almost violated. I concede defeat, though. As much as I tried NOT to cry, I just couldn't restrain myself. ""Thank GOD I didn't see this in the theater,"" I thought.The other main complain I had is that the side plot about the sister seemed to come out of nowhere at the end. Although I appreciated the comment it made about the value and importance of setting a good example and showing love to those who look up to you and want to emulate you, in hindsight it kinda seems contrived. But again, the magic of the filming somehow still managed to bring me to tears when he brought his little sister over that bridge, because it made me think of my own little sisters growing up.So here you have a movie that was in every way predictable, overbaked, and melodramatic, but still managed to wrench a very deep and sincere emotional response from a very skeptical viewer. Take that critique for what it's worth, I guess.Bridge to Terabithia a GOOD movie? Or just an average movie with some very moving themes? You decide.",Bridge to Terabithia

I cant even begin to imagine what the young children were thinking. There was this little girl next to me, probably about seven years old, and right after the little girl died I hear the kid crying and telling her dad ""daddy I'm sad"". How could they do that ??

This is not a ""Great"" movie or a ""Classic"" but it is excellent on so many levels as many of the other comments have pointed out. This movie is such a fine example of character development, storytelling, the use of children's imaginations both visually and metaphorically that you will want to share this experience with all the other important people in your life (even though they may not all appreciate it).

The film does such a good job of showing us how a child's imagination works, and is able to really show us how they're imagining Terabithia together. I loved it! The movie is very faithful to the book but also brings new life to the material. The actors who play Jesse (Hutcherson) and Leslie (AnnaSophia Robb) were both fantastic and literally could have stepped straight out of the book. Given their respective ages, I was very impressed with the level of acting talent, especially as the film draws on some adult-related themes. The visuals were fantastic and potential viewers of this film should know that the ""fantasy"" element was not at all overdone. Overall, I found the film fantastic, very well-adapted for the big screen, and well-balanced. I highly recommend it.",Bridge to Terabithia

I am so glad my little brothers and sisters brought this over to my house and told me to watch it, throughout the film as well, more of the imagination comes out. In parts of the film there is also very emotional (so don't forget to have tissues with you), I think they picked the perfect people to play the characters, the soundtrack for the film is just amazing as well.

334,TheRedComa,I was Entranced...,10,16 February 2007,"First of all, I never read the book. But, I wanted to see the film because from what the trailers told me (and I don't usually judge a film by it's trailers) the plot and scenery looked interesting. Tonight I got a call from some friends who were gonna see it, so I tagged along.Through the beginning, the movie sets itself up nicely and we are introduced to some of the main characters, and we soon find the story revolving around a quiet boy who is really good at drawing. Then we meet the new girl in town who beats all the other boys in a footrace. Soon we find out that this girl, named Leslie, has quite the imagination, and has a knack for telling stories, which quickly has the two forming a friendship. At this point I was really impressed with the children in this film, especially the two leads. Their performances were wonderful, and at this point the story began to pick up nicely as the two characters began exploring the woods in their backyard, and started to dream up a fantastic kingdom they named Terabithia. I wouldn't have had any other person direct this film other than Gabor Csupo, he really knows how to capture the lively imagination of a child, and I became engrossed in this movie.Like I said, I never read the book, and when the plot finally revealed the infamous ""Terabithia"" twist, I was shocked and heartbroken. It took every last bit of my strength to keep from bawling my eyes out right there in the theater. But still, I watched.The movie kept right on going, never missing a beat. Although the past event was tremendously sad, there is a great lesson and a lovely ending with the boy and his sister, and the continuing magic of Terabithia. This movie will make you laugh, break your heart, and dare you to keep an open mind. I would definitely consider this a family classic, sort of along the lines of E.T., Stand By Me, and My Girl.",Bridge to Terabithia

Jess and Leslie are the outcasts at school, and have difficulties at home. The fantasy land of Terabithia is their escape, the beautiful world of the imagination where anything seems possible, even though the evil is always lurking around the edges. Yet dealing with the mundane world is made easier by figuring out solutions in the fantasy land.Tragedy enters ""real life"" and Terabithia seems to be inadequate. Or is it the real solution? Special effects are present here, but again mostly at the edges. They are not the centerpiece; it is the story. Lessons learned are vital, yet the sadness lingers after the closing credits. Enjoy the heartwarming story, but be prepared to deal with very difficult situations.",Bridge to Terabithia

But hey, we all just want to make our decisions based on an industry that has basically one motivation, put butts in seats and sell tickets.Now, in regard to this movie. I would have to say that it is one of the best movies I have every watched. It is a wonderful movie for children from 8-13 who are wanting something that espouses the values of imagination, determination, friendship, and love.

Now I missed my childhood where imagination runs wild and anything is possible, but then again, nothing had changed much now either - what we are capable of doing is only limited by our imagination and determination.My favourite quote of the movie - Close your eyes, but keep your mind wide open.

One evening, as a joke, we decided to watch it as we had nothing better to do. It was much better then I had expected!! The film has a independent story line that stands apart from the land of 'Terabithia'. This improved the film from the start. The characters were played reasonably well for child actors, and despite the often repetitive 'usual' expectation depicted in the scenes at school, the story, in my opinion, was better then some previously made films trying to portray a similar theme.

344,hollygokimsy,Best Family Film in Years,10,11 March 2007,"""Bridge to Terabithia""  A+ Imagination and nostalgia are essentially the same  the changing of reality. Both have a sense of innocence, but neither is actually true.That's what makes ""Bridge to Terabithia"" the most perfect family film I've seen in years  it creates and nourishes a sense of wonderment for all viewers, regardless of their age.Jess, a typical middle schooler, lives on a farm with his sibling-filled family. His hand-me-downs and lack of assertiveness make him the subject of endless ridicule. His only outlet is drawing, which affords him praise everywhere but at home. He finds an unlikely ally in Leslie his new next-door neighbor.Leslie is a tomboy. She declares her presence by beating all the boys in a foot race. This doesn't exactly gather her any votes for ""Miss Popular"", especially with Janice the school bully. But there's something special about her.Leslie's parents are fiction authors, which Jess declares to be ""making things up"". But Leslie sees that as creative, which is her escape. After an invitation from Leslie to ""keep your eyes closed and your mind open"", the pair creates a domain that only they rule, which they christen Terabithia.Within the confines of Terabithia, anything and everything is possible. The kids develop an opportunity to exercise their underlying insecurities by reacting to their hypothetical surroundings. This paves the way for a set of special effects that would make Peter Jackson proud (especially since his company created them!) Even the best of utopias, though, eventually contain a reality check, not unlike the passing from childhood to adulthood. The tragic turn of events should bring a tear to even the most hardened cynic. It hits like a brick wall, enhanced by the strong performances of the entire cast.Be careful of the marketing, though. While being a family-oriented film, it isn't really a film for youngsters. Children under the age of seven or so may not understand the film or could be frightened by some of the imagery. Pre-teens or teenagers could be sent to see this one without supervision.But if families choose to see it together, it could start a dialogue  something sadly lacking these days. Parents could even share Katherine Paterson's novel before or after the film. But the main point is that an imagination can be even more important than the latest game system or the hottest new toy (What a novel idea!) ""Bridge to Terabithia"", unlike many other films I watch, affected me personally. Every single person, regardless of age, monetary worth, location, or anything else, needs a creative outlet of some kind in order to flourish.Thanks for allowing me to indulge mine.",Bridge to Terabithia

346,IDinProgress,Be warned. A devastatingly heart-wrenching movie. NOTHING like the trailer. Difficult for kids to watch.,7,25 June 2007,"BTT was a very good book and was adapted into a very good movie. Unfortunately, the trailer was misleading.This story is about childhood angst, growing up in a family where you are the odd one out, going to a school where you are picked on by bullies and finding a friend who helps you cope with the day to day struggles. The fantasy aspect is all in the characters' imaginations and is not a big part of the movie. Only about 10 minutes of the movie includes CGI fantasy creatures, if that. And none of it is supposed to be real. Also, the movie is very sad, so if you take children, expect lots of tears. You will most definitely cry as well. The main character Jess must face an unexpected blow; the result is anger, grief, fear but also courage in the face of tragedy. It's a very touching story, and I truly love it. I just am so angry that Disney misled viewers in such an irresponsible way. Parents have a right to be at least somewhat warned before they see a movie that will inevitably upset their child immensely. The back of the DVD describes it as ""heartwarming"". More like ""heart-wrenching"".This movie is probably too much for small children.

The girl gets him to open his consciousness to new ways of seeing things. As he is a budding artist, that is a very important gift.I was completely captivated by the characters, especially Leslie and Jess's father.

The book was inspired by a true event in the authors life. Her son lost a close friend (also a little girl) to a freak accident (in real a lightening strike). The book has a dedication to her son and his friend. This film is about friendship, the awkwardness of being a preteen and finally about loss and coping with loss. If you are seeing it expecting to experience a fantasy film such as Narnia or LOTR you will be disappointed. The acting is very well done especially by Annasophia Robb as Leslie. The movie follows the book in content very well and places just the right amount of time to Terabithia. I found it to be very true to life in regard to relationships and especially in the internal suffering and sense of guilt that Jess feels about Leslie death.

Jess makes a change because of Leslie. Here it is, you could see a movie that makes you laugh, but leaves you with nothing. Or you could walk out of the theater with a tear streaked face, but have learned a lesson that shouldn't be forgotten. Disney advertised this movie properly, and they didn't give away the Death of Leslie Burke which is an important element it the book.Lastly, Good acting, great script. Parents don't be mad because your seven year old was crying. You should have researched properly. At least that seven year old learned something you may not have taught her/him.",Bridge to Terabithia

Buuuut it didn't happen like that.Basically this social misfit boy meets this new girl and they become good friends, and all the monsters/special effects you saw on the trailer were sadly just their imagination, but despite the misleading previews, this was still an amazing movie. It really attached you emotionally to the characters and was a well done picture.Basically the rest if this comment is for the people who saw this movie and has no real reviewing relevance other than the fact that I cried for a portion of this movie.****Spoiler of Death!!! Do not read if you haven't seen the movie!!!*****Oh, and by the way, my friend and I both cried like 6 year-old girls when that girl died. Wow... And just to let you know, I have only cried during 3 movies (including this one) 1. (I don't remember the title) - but Frankenstein totally died and this little girl was definitely his best friend and she was like ""Noooo!"" and he was like ""(insert little girl's name here)!!!"" 2.

When I went with my friends to see it I was expecting to find little kids all around but their wasn't they were all teenagers. The way that it is directed and the magical scenes that are contained within makes you feel as though you are actually there in Terabithia. When you first see the magical creatures come out it feels as though they are actually flying toward you, like they are about to crash into you. Anna Sophia Robb gives a wonderful performance as Leslie Burke with a spunky attitude. She doesn't care what people think about her and she has the best story writing abilities. Jesse Aarons (Josh Hutcherson) is a a runner and artist who is miss-understood by his family.

I believe that every family should go see this movie, it is a very thought provoking movie, and we need one of those that our kids can actually get excited about. I really enjoyed this movie, and its not just a movie that your kids can get excited about, it is a movie that the whole family can and will enjoy!

I sat in the theater for 10 minutes after the credits ended before I was composed enough to get up.It was a wonderful story, well-acted and well-done, but perhaps too emotional for those who have a child with medical issues or other potential tragedies.My son wants to go again with his brother but I'm not sure I can handle it.",Bridge to Terabithia
359,babywayextreme,"Imaginative, Moving Film.",8,10 July 2007,"When I entered the local movie theater months ago, I honestly was not expecting much. I was actually debating whether I should have brought my ten year old brothers because I had read the book (and knew of its sad ending). The previews had made the film look shallow, stereotypically sappy, and, well, dumb. Which was, in my opinion, sharp contrast to the book that had moved me when I had read it for the first time. As I don't want to reveal too much about the movie, I will say this: The acting is good and believable, it stays true to the book, and actually leaves the viewer with that since of pure satisfaction that recent movies released in that mid February spot(ugh, Ghost Rider anyone?) have been lacking. About the rating, in my opinion (again), 'Bridge' is one of rare films that is too harsh for PG and far too mellow for PG-13. If I were to rate it, I would give it a PG-10 (around or above ten is recommended). For parents with young children, I don't think that any child under the age of eight should see this film--it does have some plot twists that could be disturbing for a young child (but it's your call completely, my six year old cousin saw this movie and loved it). I do think that this is a 'kid's' movie, but I still suggest a parent get an opinion from someone whose seen it (or watch it yourself) before showing it to your child. But this heartfelt, moving, tear jerking, gender neutral film should not be missed. It's a film that, I believe, should be seen by the old and young alike. And it's one that should not be forgotten.NOTE: My brothers and I all loved the film and cried like babies when it was over.",Bridge to Terabithia

362,omninexus,A Travesty,1,16 February 2007,"This movie was a terrible disappointment. The story was butchered, the special effects were cheap, the plot was full of holes and dead ends that the book dealt with expertly. The actors were splendid; they simply had very little to work with. It could have been so much more, but instead Disney botched things as usual. The trailer deceives those who watch it by displaying all kinds of fantastical imagery - most of which is seen only in the last five minutes of the movie. The climax of the story and the main character's reaction to it were vastly understated, and you're left wondering if any person would recover so quickly. Don't waste your money. This film should have went straight to DVD. For a well-transfered book series, watch Harry Potter, or better, Narnia. This movie will disappoint fans of the book and first timers alike. I can't believe they had millions of dollars in the budget and churned out a dying flop of a film. Again, the best part of this movie is the acting, but since they had nothing to work with, it's nothing more than another nail in Disney Corporation's coffin.",Bridge to Terabithia

364,G-Matt,"Wonderful fantasy movie, in its own way",10,16 July 2007,"I saw this movie a few weeks ago when I was flying to Hawaii from Finland. I watched it on the plane. I haven't ever read the book (until now I'm going to start) so I didn't know what the movie was about.Well, what can I say? Bridge to Terabithia is an absolutely well done movie. The story is very interesting. The idea of a magical world created by two friends ""coming to life"" is a unique idea. The acting is excellent as all of the actors give shining performances. Of course, the performances of Josh Hutcherson (Jesse) and Annasophia Robb (Leslie) are the best ones. They really make their characters believable, interesting, and most of all, lovable. Even I have to admit that Annasophia Robb is now one of my favorite actresses, thanks to Bridge to Terabithia. The creatures of Terabithia are unique as well. Their designs are good and they're brought to life wonderfully by CGI.SPOILERS AHEADOne thing I have to point out about the movie, and that's the tragic twist in the story. I have to do this because I'm an emotional person. When I watched the movie for the first time, I was watching it with joy and delight. But then suddenly, Jesse hears that Leslie has died. My God how surprised I was. All of a sudden I just wasn't happy anymore; I was shocked and totally sad. I hoped that Leslie's death wasn't true, just like Jesse. I was crying, just like Josh Hutcherson did in his great acting. But, of course, it was all true.When the movie ended, I didn't know what to think. I couldn't decide if the movie was good or not. I even thought if Leslie died only in the movie, but not in the original book. But when I did research on the book, I found out that both the book and the movie have the same ending. All of a sudden, the movie had become an obsession for me. I saw the new DVD in every video store in the States and I thought whether to buy it or not since Finland is in region 2.SPOILERS ENDBut now I won't have to buy the DVD immediately. Why? Because Bridge to Terabithia will be released in Finnish theaters on August 3rd! I'm so excited. I'm definitely going to see it on the big screen. But if I don't, then I'll buy it on DVD when it's released in Finland. It's a wonderful fantasy movie, and worth to see.",Bridge to Terabithia

During this movie my heart went out to the main character, his hard life and the things he went through. The introduction of the female character brought new excitement for the main character and the viewer. This movie was not a fantasy but rather a tale of how using your imagination can make even the hardest times seem better and how to love the people around you. The main character goes through rough times including trying to get love from his father, at times he is unable to believe due to his fathers remarks yet the little girls world is far more inviting. There are hard lessons in this movie. In this movie the children find a rope hanging over a ditch filled with water. It is dangerous yet the little girl swings across inviting the boy to do so. They never get hurt on this rope, they are always together when they go there and I wondered if the movie should mention that children shouldn't swing across ropes they are unsure of. Later she dies going across alone leaving the boy feeling guilty for not being there thus reuniting him with his fathers love and understanding.

If so, I can't understand why the book is ""beloved"". It seems that piece of the advertisement was added also as a smoke screen to get people in the theater.

While I knew of the basic plot - and was turned off by the marketing - the film succeeded in being a very unexpected, but enjoyable experience.The film opens a door on two adolescents who escape their difficulties at school and home by entering an imagined world where they can fight evil and reign as royalty. The film portrayed the power of imagination well, creating an exciting, but not 'magical' atmosphere.The acting, particularly of the younger actors, should be applauded. There are some tragic turns in this film, and the younger actors deal with these themes very well.At times the pacing was a little slow, but on the whole it captured my imagination and made me want to create my own fantasy world that I could enjoy.

First thing which makes this movie different from the other fantasies is that even though a fantasy, it doesn't loses its touch with reality. Even though we know Terabithia is just an imagination (in the movie), we get attached to it.I have not read the book. So i can't compare the two. But after watching the movie I am just dying to read the book.Another plus point of this film is the fine performances delivered by both young actors, Josh Hutcherson (Jesse) and AnnaSophia Robb (Leslie), in both light and serious moments. Bailee Madison (May) is also quite good.It really made me feel nostalgic about my childhood as I remembered my childhood fantasies, my dreams, my own imaginary world, in short my own bridge to Terabithia.Now about the negative points, only thing that bugged me was its less run time (95 min). Because of this, we only get a glimpse of Terabithia. So many children who are expecting this movie to be like HP or LOTR would be disappointed.But still overall, it's very well done.

374,bombayboyz_90491,Excellent!!!!,10,4 July 2007,"Perhaps the single most heart wrenching movie I have ever seen. Let me say this: Pan's Labyrinth was a masterpiece, and delved into the depths of a young child's heart and mind using an astounding mixture of connecting metaphors and a scary journey in juxtaposition to an even scarier world. It was truly saddening, because it had to be. It explained it's sadness in a way that can be traced through it's own tale. That said, Bridge to Terabithia manifests within the soul a more profound (indeed, THE most profound) sadness, one which I have only felt when those closest to me have passed on. Never in my life has art created something that saddens me and eludes an answer. Pan's Labyrinth's answer is traceable; Terabithia's lies beyond my mind's ability to explain, perhaps because it is so real, so alone, so transcendental. What I can say is that it is in one perspective ironic that I am saddened by those who cannot feel this way because they have forgotten what it was like to once possess an open mind, like a child's. A cynical layer of myself would say it's too childish and can be seen through. But the truth elicited in Terabithia shows that each layer is at once important and ridiculous, and underneath this lies what a true open mind is: one that is not afraid to admit that everyone must be right, that everyone must be wrong, that for now, this is all complete garbage.

Also, I usually expect fantasy settings to be a little more involving. I found that the world of Terabithia has absolutely no purpose to it other than to satisfy the imagination of the kids. Then there's Leslie's death which I find ridiculous. Yes I understand those things can happen in real life, but when you have only two main characters you don't just kill one of in such a lame way and off-screen.Overall, I really disliked the movie, but I'll admit it's probably because it just doesn't appeal to me.

I could not think of a more unoriginal and unimaginative plot twist and I thought it all very humorous (not what I was meant to think I fear). The ending to the film was hilarious for its stupidity and lacking in any form of interest. I know that the story is not meant to be realistic, yet I thought there was SOME realism in the story. This was all thrown out o the window in the last scene when the main character constructed the ... in such an immense style that would be impossible for a boy to complete in the time-scale allowed.

I had not read the book before seeing it, and so all was a surprise to me. The film's two leads (Robb and Hutcherson) are superb and create a sense of wonder. Not necessarily for children under the age of 8, but adults will definitely appreciate the intensity of the film. I have read several reviews that state that the ending is unsatisfying. I strongly disagree. There is a strong, powerful message that will resonate with all those who will keep their ""minds wide open.""

386,edumibog14,Bridge to Terabithia - from book to movie,7,29 December 2007,"Bridge to Terabithia is based on the children's book by Katherine Patterson. I have never read the book, though I gather that the movie follows it fairly closely. I expected to see a movie along the lines of Narnia or Stardust, due to a misleading marketing campaign, and found the first half an hour of the film very slow and predictable. However, Bridge to Terabithia is subtly and surprisingly engaging, particularly from about an hour into the film when something dramatic happens - though I won't give that away.Jesse Aarons (Josh Hutcherson) is the only boy of five children. His parents struggle financially, and his father tends to ignore him and favors his younger sister. Jesse has no friends and is the target of school bullies. His only escape in life seems to be drawing and painting. This changes when a new girl, Leslie Burke (AnnaSophia Robb), moves in next door, and beats him in a running race at school that Jesse has set his heart on.Against the odds, the introverted Jesse and louder, opinionated Leslie become friends. She awakens his imagination with her inventions of a magical world, Terabithia, set in a forest over a stream near their homes. Jesse starts to open up more, and the children's friendship deepens as they struggle together through bullying at school and events in their home lives, which come to be reflected in their shared imaginations of Terabithia.Bridge to Terabithia does not have a strong story line when compared to many recent children's movies. It is very character focused, and is probably more suitable for children over the age of 10, as its themes would not be fully comprehended by younger viewers and they may find their attention wandering. Previous reviewers have praised AnnaSohpia Robb's performance, but it is Josh Hutcherson who really steals the limelight with his heart-wrenching performance towards the end of the movie. I watched this with two thirteen-year-olds - a boy and a girl -, and, despite complaints that the movie was boring to start off with, sixty minutes in dead silence fell as we sat riveted because of the intensity and maturity that this young actor displayed. Bridge to Terabithia could have been better adapted from the book to the movie - after all, there's a huge difference between reading something and watching it for an hour and a half, especially when the first thirty minutes seemed to drag on forever without a point. However, believable characters and strong performances by all the actors pulled it through to the end. The girls will be crying and the boys unusually silent - even parents might shed a tear or two. A good family film with both lightheartedness and depth that is not often found in kids movies these days. 7/10",Bridge to Terabithia
387,Starshimy,Disappointing but good,4,17 February 2007,"If you're looking for a cool fantasy movie like the previews show, you'll be extremely disappointed. In a good fantasy movie, the fantasy is believable and while watching the movie, you're swept away by it and believe it to be real. You don't get that feeling in this movie which is obvious from the beginning when the fantasy is first introduced. You never once think Terabithia might be a real place or these creatures might be real creatures.But if you're looking for a tender movie about the relationship of a son with his father, it's a sweet tale.Though it is a Disney film, it might be too depressing for younger children. The previews falsely advertise what kind of film this. I went thinking this movie was about a fantastical place called Terabithia.

I have never seen such a powerful bond of friendship between friends. It was so amazing and magical. How many of us can say our friendships were as close or as connected as Jess's and Leslie's? This has to be the best thing about the movie; the connection of such an emotional friendship, the type that is more valuable than silver or gold. As for the rest of the movie, it was adorable. Wonderful acting, beautiful plot, powerful ending. This shows that there is no boundary to someone's imagination, nor should there be.

392,revan-rose,"Close your eyes, but keep your mind wide open . . .",9,18 February 2007,"Bridge To TerabithiaI have not read the book and did not see this movie with many expectations. To begin with, this is a story of Jesse Aarons (Josh Hutcherson). Jesse is the fastest runner in his class and very proud of being so. Frequently picked on by the local bullies, troubled with the financial situation back home and oft ignored by all but one of his 5 sisters, he immerses himself within his drawings as an escape... Leslie Burke (AnnaSophia Robb)is the new-kid in his class. She has a panache for writing which coupled by her ability to outrun all the guys in her class (including Jesse) ensures that she doesn't have the best luck making new friends. However, with their affinity to be picked on, Jesse and Leslie soon find themselves extremely fond of each other and off looking for a place of their own... This is Terabithia...And this is where I'll end my summary for I do not wish to go into the spoilers for the movie.All the kids in the movie really shine in their respective roles. As many reviewers have said before me, Josh and AnnaSophia are a wonderful pair! I would also like to mention the young Bailee Madison (playing Josh's younger sister) for her portrayal of May Belle. However, what truly lifts this movie from ""good"" to ""great"" is the simplicity of the whole story. This is a children's movie through and through and but do not expect a typical Disney feel-good comedy. Do not also expect huge CG sequences like say, The Chronicles of Narnia.This movie is full of heart and everything about it is shown from the eyes of a child. Life, is not a pretty thing and more than the magical kingdom of Terabithia, this is a tale of a young kids' coming to terms with matters of being bullied, being loved, having a true friend and even trying to understand death.By the end of it all, many people around me were moved to tears and I myself was trying desperately to hold back. The movie, its message and its delivery are all beautiful.On a critical note, the only thing about the movie that I didn't particularly love was the music. The music in general wasn't very well suited and certain songs were just not needed, but I suppose thats what the MTv culture demands.In conclusion, I highly recommend it. Go and watch this movie and if you have them, take your children... They'll love it!9/10",Bridge to Terabithia

Yes, it deals with mature subject matter, but maybe you haven't let your kids out of the house lately. This stuff happens. It happens in their school today. Even grade school.SPOILER ALERT: Kids get bullied. Kids die. Yes, these things are horrible (and don't blame Disney for the rating, it is set by the MPAA), but you know what, since it DOES happen in real life kids NEED to have a way to deal with it. My 11 year-old son was awed by this movie, and needed to take some time to process it, but it really showed him a way to deal with the bullies and creeps he has to deal with in school, and how to deal with bad things which (inevitably) do happen. The fantasy land gave both Jesse and Leslie the strength to deal with the bullies (even the ""dark master"") and in the end, brought Jesse and his sister closer than ever, and started to reverse the hurt and pain between Jesse and his father. And finally, for those of you wondering about the ""can kids be damned to hell"" bit, think of Leslie's death as a Christ-like event where her death brings Jesse's family closer - something that seemed impossible at the middle of the film.

396,aelaycock-76130,The magical kingdom of reality,10,28 September 2017,"It's magical, but maybe not in the way you expect. A troubled boy (Josh Hutcherson = Jess) from a strict religious family, befriends a new girl (AnnaSophia Robb = Leslie). She is unconventionally dressed, with striking straight blonde cropped hair. She is the more adventurous of the two, while he is initially quite timid - possibly because of his strict upbringing, and the perceived indifference of his parents. He is irritable at times, very cross when his young sister draws all over his art book. He is also annoyed when Leslie wins a school race. That's what I like about it - not all sweetness and light. Jess and Leslie inevitably become friends. One day after school they stumble on an overgrown forest area which becomes their magical kingdom. The kingdom is only accessible via a swing rope across a creek (The rope plays an important part later on in the story). In the meantime, the film wisely concentrates on reality, with only occasional excursions into the realm of the imagination. The CGI is strictly rationed - which is fine by me. The two friends form a deep bond, escaping as often as they can. But Jess has chores doled out by his over-strict father (who has money worries). His relationship with his father is an understated but important element, developing as the movie progresses. When Jess visits Leslie's home, he discovers a very different, relaxed lifestyle. He helps them paint a room gold. She reciprocates by attending a church service with him. At school they both experience the kind of low-level bullying we have all encountered; but also, sympathetic teaching.One teacher, recognising his artistic talent, invites Jess to an art gallery. For reasons he doesn't fully understand, he fails to invite Leslie on this trip. We sense that the plot is moving towards some sort of epiphany.What I love about this movie is the complete lack of sentimentality and self-pity. Somehow it is nonetheless deeply moving. It's a shame the mothers don't play a greater role, I would like to know more about them; but really there is little to criticise. The performance of Josh Hutcherson as Jess I found quite remarkable. I get so frustrated with movies these days, it's miraculous to find one which ticks all the boxes.",Bridge to Terabithia

The adverts give the impression of a Narnia-esquire film with two children accidentally stumbling on a magical kingdom, but the truth is far from this. Terabithia is instead a made up world created in the minds of two young kids as an escape from the bullying they face at school and the unhappiness they feel in their homelife. Consequently the film deals with issues such as loneliness, loss and domestic violence, harsh realities that contrast greatly with the fabricated adventures that Jess and Leslie come up with. However despite this the movie is entertaining, with some great performances especially from the young AnnaSophia Robb and Josh Hutcherson. Also, in my opinion, the freedom, innocence and creativity of Jess and Leslie is quite refreshing.All in all i'm not sure how a young child would react to the movie, although there's probably enough fantasy to keep them entertained and enough reality to cause them to ask questions. However I know one early twenty year old who has just sobbed through the last half an hour....",Bridge to Terabithia

403,drumly,"So many positives to rave about, yet we are talking about marketing techniques!",8,18 February 2007,"Apparently there is some marketing scandal, where a movie's trailers have somewhat misrepresented a film. I am certain that, as this is the first time in history that that has ever happened, some heads will roll. Not. Not one newspaper or television review that I saw before I went to this film stated that it was anything different than it was. As an adult I don't even choose to see a film based entirely on the trailer alone, let alone let my kids see one based on the trailer. I always just assumed that the rating PG was advice to not let 4, 5 and 6 year olds go and see it. I didn't let my five year old watch Narnia either. I'm not certain animal sacrifice and kindergarten are a great mix.Sadly, all of this negativity seems to be missing the fact that this is an honest and heartfelt recreation of Katherine Patterson's novel. It is particularly good for the 10 - 14 crowd, which is where the novel ends up commonly used in school. Like others, I was worried that this was going to be a Disney disaster just like Where the Red Fern Grows, or Paramount's recent live action Charlotte's Web. They deal with similar themes to this one, but for some reason neither movie appealed to me, even though I love both books.This time around, I was pleasantly surprised. The two main actors solidly interact and we care about them enough to make the end of the story have an impact. The story is well told, the visual effects add a sense of whimsy, although it is a little ironic that a story about the power of your imagination has to spell out the power of imagination. The idea that people need more ""realistic"" fantastic imaginations from the minds of 11 year olds will just start me on another rant, so I won't go there.Just like the book, there are many interesting entry points into discussion with kids about a wide variety of topics. The book's most controversial moments are pretty much kept intact; the discussion about the literal interpretation of the concept of damnation as it applies to the bible, children and loss being the biggest and most obvious. Then there is guilt and grief. There is the difference between the crush that Jesse has for his teacher and Leslie's father's statement that Leslie ""loved"" Jesse. There is the rich nature of the title, is it literally related to the end of the movie or is there a metaphorical meaning too. And there are so many more! In other words, it is fairly intelligent and offers many ways to actually talk about the experience of watching the movie.How horrible.The only knock that I have on the movie is that some of the things seem weird (a teacher taking a student on a weekend field trip, the music program consisting exclusively of singing folk songs to guitar, etc) partly because the time period of the ""1970's"" is not explicitly stated anywhere. It is less jarring when you are not trying to put it into a 2007 context. To parents that are planning on seeing this film with their families, make sure you leave time to hit the food courts for fruit juice and talk time after this movie. This movie has meaning to it and requires more work than some of the other twaddle that is out there. If you are not a parent, keep in mind that it is a children's film and I imagine you will still find yourself moved to tears by the story and remembering your own awkwardness while growing up.",Bridge to Terabithia

Robert Patrick played a nuanced supporting role. AnnaSophia Robb is charismatic. Josh Hutcherson did an excellent job playing a brooding adolescent.Some of the film sequences are BRILLIANT. For instance, when the kids are swinging across the river in a rope they did a wonderful job of capturing how actually swinging alters your perceptions. The same is true in the running sequences.

The friendship starts after Leslie beats Jesse in an all-boy race no questions asked.

If you are a concerned parent I say check into it, I think it is worth seeing.A friend of mine lost a very close friend in her life.

I'm a huge fan of fantasy films. I was disappointed in the entire story. I thought it was like a newer version of ""My Girl"". However, I did think that the two main characters were great little actors. The plot was weak. I'm sure there was some hidden lesson to be learned. However, I was so bored halfway through. I will admit that I cried a little bit. I was looking for a fun fantasy film, and ended up watch a sub-par tear-jerker. I will continue to re-watch all Harry Potter movies! I would not recommend viewing this movie at all. Maybe kids would enjoy it, but it deals with some heavy subjects.",Bridge to Terabithia

I wouldn't advise anyone (who hasn't seen it) to read the spoilers on these reviews, it's such a shocking twist...and this certainly wasn't the ending i expected, but it was different i suppose!!! 'Bridge To Terabithia' i think, is the movie of the year without a doubt - you have to see it to know what i mean. It's simply a film for any age and is extremely unlikely to disappoint - though some may say, the ending was. All i can say, is to brace yourself for the last 20 minutes of it...i wont say no more! It'll guarantee to be higher than your expectations, well worth the money...to see a marvellous film like this!",Bridge to Terabithia

Whether or not you are a fan of fantasy, action, drama, comedy... this movie has it ALL. Not to mention the cinematography was amazing. These young actors and actresses did amazing work and I feel they will go on to bigger and better things. This film did not get the recognition that I feel it truly deserves.

418,jjsmoke62,Why oh Why oh Why???????,1,19 February 2007,"I saw the movie last night and was shocked. I can never understand why Disney feels the need to bombard children with life's woes? I go in thinking I'm going to see another Narnia, and pow!!! Number one question. Is this for children? I say NO! Childhood is about innocence. This robs that as far as I'm concerned. It is a parents job to break the cold hard facts of life to kids, not Disneys! I just wonder when someone sits down and writes this type of movie or book, do they consider the audience? What twisted person sits in their office and says to him or herself, ""Oh I'll make a movie about depressing, real life tragedy, and show it to the kids in Chuckie Cheese!""? Can any one say, sick? If you are into this type of human tragedy movie, more power too you. I certainly go to the movie's to escape life's tragedy. Reality packs enough punch as it is for me. I look for fantasy as a means to avoid the cold hard life facts, and pay 10 dollars to get away for 2 hours.But bottom line, this movie should have been billed as for adults. I expect this type of picture on an indie channel with lots of disclaimers, possibly sporting a R rating. Not with Disney's Magic Castle and fairy's flying around! The mature theme's and religious questioning were way over the top for anyone under 13 years old! I had no children with me when I saw it with my wife, and as we exited, the children looked like their dog died, whereas, as they were entering they were happy and having a ball. What good can possibly come of this flick to this target audience?",Bridge to Terabithia

The characters are well developed, the acting and cinematography stellar. I would recommend for the entire family, I even think the parents might enjoy it more than the kids :) This movie was a representation of what it means to be a true friend, it brought me back to my own childhood and I literally felt like a child again.

421,monopolygame,Save some money and get the book from the library instead,3,24 June 2007,"I read the book and saw the original movie before this, but I have to say out of the three experiences, I found the latest attempt the least enjoyable. What I liked about the book was that Terabithia was imaginative. The movie appeared a little too focused on showing fantastic imagery, while the strength of the book was its intentional ambiguity. The story tacitly encouraged readers to develop their own imaginations and to see their own Terabithia. On the other hand, the fantasy world in the movie felt a lot more like a weird ripoff of Harry Potter imagery, while also forcing concrete ideas where there weren't any. I just think it's unfortunate that my little brother was robbed of the opportunity to conjure up his own impressions of what Jesse and Leslie were doing and imagining. The first movie was pretty cheesy, but the budget and direction for this one completely undermined the only real strength of the storyline, which was the encouragement of fantasizing for yourself. It was a decent book, but it makes for pretty bad cinema.Having read a review that suggested that we not judge a movie based on the trailers, I disagree. Trailers are used to entice audiences to see a movie by showing clips that give the viewer a feeling of what he or she could expect to encounter during the film. Disney's advertising focused on an area that Katherine Paterson intentionally avoided. The problem with this is that with the exception of the CGI, Disney stayed pretty close to the storyline; they just created a false impression of what a viewer could expect to see. I saw the movie expecting to see a retelling, and instead I saw Disney ruin the most valuable aspect of the story.I just think it's ludicrous to blame parents for not researching it; considering Disney's penchant for taking liberties with stories, and especially given the nature of the previews, even people who knew the original storyline seemed surprised at the ending, considering how it was advertised. I mean, I've never come out of a James Bond movie with the complaint that I felt misled by the preview. If they cut Meet the Fokkers to make it look like a spy movie, however, I would certainly be let down because it wouldn't have met any of my expectations for the film.",Bridge to Terabithia

I am a theater manager and was thrilled when I was going through our movie posters a few months ago and found one for Terabitha. I read the book fifteen years ago for school and while I was quite young, remembered it well. This wonderfully done movie had the same impact on me now as an adult as the book did when I was a child. It is a truly inspirational story of friendship and a child's imagination.Both leads were excellently done, especially Josh Hutcherson, who made you feel the pain Jess feels at the end of the movie. I also want to mention the scene stealing Bailee Madison, whose May Belle's smile helped brighten even the most heart breaking moments.I just want to close with to words of warning, this is not one to take the little kids to, it is very serious and upsetting at points so I would say at least 9 or older. My other warning bring a box of tissues.",Bridge to Terabithia
423,pierce44,Major Hit Brewing,10,6 February 2007,"Saw the premiere and the movie has all the earmarks of a major hit. You never know for sure with American audiences but this is a very beautiful and engaging film. It REALLY outclasses any number of recent movies marketed at kids and it is one of the few I've seen that shows honest portrayals of both children and adults. No one, not even the bullies, is a stereotype or caricature. The novel is a masterpiece, but this film holds its own. With so many films, you walk out, whether amused or annoyed, and soon forget most of what you saw. Not so with Bridge--it stays with you, as it should. Go and enjoy...and then pass the word.",Bridge to Terabithia
424,rdraglon,Once in a Blue Moon,10,11 February 2008,"I will admit, I started watching this movie out of boredom and the lack of any other movies airing at the time that were of interest, and because I was just too lazy to reach for the remote. Maybe I've been too much of an adult for too long and maybe I'm not the only person like that, for I had forgotten the pure magic of just being a child with a vivid imagination that generates excitement, fills the voids of loneliness, lack of acceptance, and serves as an escape and refuge from the stark reality of life. Bridge to Terabithia was a much needed reminder of many things age can take away from us. I was caught off guard when Leslie was lost and memories flooded my mind of William Parker. We were both 7 yrs. old and best friends when he was hit by a car and killed. My dad was going to take us fishing the coming weekend and suddenly he was forever lost. Then there was 'Missy' Smith. A beautiful little 4 yr. my mom had babysat for and whom I had held and played with every afternoon after school. Her brother and sister were at the construction site of a house, rocking on opposite ends of a bundle of A-frames for the roof, when then bundle flipped over and the corner hit Missy in the back of the head. I heard the panic stricken cries as her brother ran from the construction site toward our house carrying her small limp body. We put her in the car and rushed her to the town clinic only 5 minutes away but it was too late. Only the day before she was looking through the screen of her bedroom window calling my name and waving goodbye as I was leaving. No, William and Missy aren't the only people taken too soon and I live in the faith that I will meet them again. What an affect a movie can have; I never saw it coming and, after 40 yrs. of suppressed memories, my heart was broken again and the tears flowed. And at the end when Jesse and his little sister again entered Terabithia, I spoke to myself aloud, 'I wish I were there!' Maybe some day I will be...maybe there's room for all of us in Terabithia!",Bridge to Terabithia
425,smu_pnk,Heart-wrenchingly beautiful,10,16 May 2007,"I took my girls (9 and 6) without having any expectations. I was blown away by the film. It provided a stark reminder of how much of my childhood has been lost to the ardours of life. Such a painful realisation. However, Bridge to Terabithia does suggest just how important it is for all adults to reach back to that more innocent time.The movie was very well made. While the realism was surprising given the trailers, the emergence of the fantasy characters toward the end (starting with the troll) was a letdown and unnecessary. I would also agree with other comments that the marketing for the movie was WAY off base and counterproductive. How sad that the movie makers thought so little of the story they were weaving that they felt the need to provide a literal visualisation for the kids' fantasies.Just a beautiful and wholesome film, one that I really thought would never get made again in this age of bling, perversion and shock. I plan to buy the DVD to watch it with my kids from time to time.",Bridge to Terabithia

I read the book a very very long time ago, so I don't know how closely it followed it, but I do know that I enjoyed the movie much more than the book. It completely changed my view of what a movie should be. My normal preference is high packed action, but this story blew all the action movies out of the water. Goodbye Jacki Chan.

427,gunae31,Pleasantly Surprised,9,16 February 2007,"When I first saw the preview for this movie I almost jumped out of my seat. This was one of my favorite books when I was a child. I got so excited that I bought the book and my son and I read it. (He is about the age that I was when I first read it!)Then I couldn't wait for the movie to come out. We have been counting down the days. I have to admit that I was a little (okay, a lot) skeptical. The imagery in the previews looked a bit cheesy and it appeared that they were taking quite a bit of liberty with the plot line. However, we just got back from seeing it and both my son and I were very impressed. I thought they did a wonderful job of staying true to the story. My only critique(s) would have to be : 1) I wish they had have developed the fearful aspect of Jesse's character a little bit better. That is the main theme in the book. It is about a boy who is so bound by fear that he is afraid to express himself except in his little book of drawings. Then he meets Leslie, who shows no fear, and with her powerful imagination she teaches him how to be brave. Then his biggest test is how to continue to be brave after she is gone. So, I think they could have shown Jesse to be more fearful - I really think that was key to the story. 2) I think the ending was a little over the top. They had done such a great job so far with underplaying the imagination scenes so that the audience still had to use their own imaginations and I think they tried too hard at the end to cram a bunch of fantasy into it.I did love how all of the creatures in Terabithia correlated to a bully-type character from their real lives. That was very well done!!!I highly recommend this movie. It is great for all ages. But, definitely read the book first. It makes much more sense if you do.",Bridge to Terabithia

429,kerrykane-1,I probably would prefer the book to the movie,3,10 February 2007,"I can tell you that my 10 and 6 year old kids were very emotionally moved by the latter events in this movie. Frankly its a very depressing movie, seems as if only the 2 main characters are likable, and they are making a fantasy world to escape reality. I tend to enjoy books based on this sort of realism, but I'm not sure this was one that my kids got that much from - I was expecting a fantasy movie and got a depressing reality movie with a very sad last 30 minutes and really very little fantasy. Had I read the book and known what I was seeing it probably would not have been as shocking. My wife was very troubled by this movie - she has really gotten down on Disney movies ever since Old Yeller and the Otter movie - seems as if they feel obligated to kill off at least one of the likable characters to get an emotional reaction out of you.",Bridge to Terabithia
430,Zoo_Kreeper,"A decent movie in itself, but horrible as a fantasy and for children",1,29 December 2009,"To be fair, Bridge to Terabithia is actually quite a nice movie....if you ignore the fact that it is advertised as fantasy and aimed at children. If it were marketed correctly, I would be pressed to give it a MUCH higher rating, but as it stands it is completely inappropriate.I have never read the book so I'll admit that I went willingly into it uninformed, but neither have a lot of other people who made that same decision and I imagine the people in charge of the movie must have realized this. It therefor falls on the previews to accurately portray the content of the film for those of us unfamiliar with the original text, but whoever was responsible for that failed miserably.By the trailers, one would reasonably expect the movie to be something akin to The Chronicles of Narnia: children entering their own miraculous fantasy land, with all sorts of adventure and no shortage of magical creatures.What you get is only a few brief glimpses at anything even remotely whimsical. There are some monster squirrels and a giant troll based off of real life bullies they have problems with at school, and the ""Dark Master"" who is only ever seen as a black blur running through the trees and never has a direct encounter with any of the characters.The majority of the movie deals with hard life issues, like emotionally distant family members, bullying, isolation, and the harsh reality that you have to grow up and leave your childish fantasies behind sooner or later, that the real word is a rough place and you have to learn to weather it. That's all well and good in a coming-of-age film for older kids, but that is not what it's marketed as or who it's aimed at.The fantasy elements (which we rarely actually get to see) are imagined by the two main characters, Jess and Leslie, as a coping mechanism and never fully developed until the very end of the movie, where Terabithia FINALLY comes alive in its fullest, but we only get to see it for a few seconds before the credits roll.There is a bit somewhere in the middle where they bring up religious commentary out of nowhere, and why they feel the need to do that is anybody's guess as it has very little to do with any part of the movie before that moment. It ends up coming off as awkward and a bit pretentious on the writer's part and probably should have been cut. (Not to speak poorly of religion or Christianity; it just seemed totally out of place here.) But perhaps worst of all is Leslie's death. The movie spends the whole time up to that building her up as a sort of personal savior for Jess. He is alone at school and at home, with nobody to appreciate his love for the arts, until Leslie and her family move in next door and he finally meets a kindred spirit. They fast become best friends and through Leslie, Jess can finally experience happiness. If they had left it at that, this might have been a perfect kids' movie, but instead, near the end of the film, they kill Leslie off out of nowhere while Jess is away on a trip with his teacher at the museum and when he comes home his parents just lay it on him. So not only does he lose the closest person to him at that point, he is not allowed to say goodbye to her and the news that she is gone is dropped on him like a bomb.It is truly and completely tragic. They just keep laying one thing after another on poor Jess until you feel YOU, the viewer from the outside, are going to cave under the feeling of complete and total hopelessness and grief.Now, everyone has to learn to deal with tragedy at some point and it would be perfectly acceptable if the people in charge of advertising had given us fair warning of this ahead of time, but they did no such thing. They made it seem like a bright, fun, fantastic children's movie and then blindsided us with a load of bereavement so overwhelming that it smothers the rest of the film and makes you feel horrible afterward. I am twenty-one years old and well acquainted with these sorts of things, and I was surprised into tears when they killed that sweet little girl. There is no way a little kid would be ready to handle that.I feel as though I was tricked into watching this movie, and it was almost shameful for those in charge to advertise it for young children.",Bridge to Terabithia

I was quite surprised though. The movie stayed true to the book and I think that it is a very good movie for 7-13 year olds especially. The parts that I really enjoyed were when the characters imaginations came to life in Terabithia. It made everything seem so real. The ending was very magical and moving..I am not usually an emotional person but i found myself on the verge of tears. The Acting was really good as well. The young girl that played Leslie did a great job as well as Zooey Deschanel playing the kids teacher. Overall, I was very impressed and I was surprised at how good of a job was done to make the movie out of the book. The acting, characters, sets, storyline were very well done.

I've never read the book so from the trailers I anticipated a fantasy type movie similar to Shrek but with real-life characters. What I got was so much more. The movie really brings home the financial problems faced with many households and the awkwardness of being the new kid in school. This is not just a fantasy movie - it shows how 2 children/preteens bond and use that bond to tackle and deal with problems that they face in their life. Disney does this with finesse and without adding unnecessary cursing, smoking or any contrivances that some movies use to ""add"" intrigue.I was totally unsuspecting that one of the title characters would die towards the end of the movie. I was going along completely enthralled when out of the blue this happens. I would definitely recommend bringing Kleenex as your bottom lip will be hurting by the end of the movie with biting it to keep yourself from tearing up.It was probably one of the best movies I've seen in a long time and would recommend it highly.",Bridge to Terabithia

I too was wanting more the of the magical world..The movie also contains a scene overused in so many average movies of the happy family dancing to music.I also felt like the music teacher was a potential pedophile...alone with a student at a museum on a Saturday?

I watched my 9 year old son cry because of what happened to the girl. I know that most movies show the ""good"" parts on the previews but not all of them. I was expecting more of Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings...ish.

My daughter had been looking forward to this new fantasy and from the previews this appears to be just that. This is no fairy tale. A child dies in this movie, so unless you're ready to have long discussions with your children please don't take them to see this. I'd recommend not seeing this, more due to Disney's careless promotion of it's contents. Disney is one of my favorite of all time where kids are concerned but in this case, shame on you Disney! Very little of Terabithia is shown in this movie, a few glimpses here and there but over all this movie is about middle aged kids, bullies, religion, friendship and a child's death.

This movie touches a part of our hearts that a lot of us tend to suppress and never see come to fruition in our own lives. As we get older, we tend to be consumed by the demands of life and forget where real life is. We listen to the world tell us that life is about success and getting ahead in life.

I didn't have a copy of the book to refresh my memory with, so I read the wikipedia article about it. This article provides a good summary of what both the book and movie are about. I wanted to see this movie for personal reasons. I had a friend in high school who was killed in a tragic car accident. It took me a long, long time to get over it. I was very impressed with the acting of the various characters. Both Josh Hutcherson and AnnaSophia Robb do very well with their leading roles, despite limited experience on the big screen. Robert Patrick was great as the strict but loving father, even though his previous screen appearance as a sociopathic jewelry thief in John Cena's not so epic ""The Marine"" was anything but stellar. I also liked Lauren Clinton's portrayal of the school bully Janice Avery. Her performance was very dynamic despite playing a minor character in the story. The only difference I can find between the book and the movie is that the book makes reference to Washington, DC as the author spent part of her life in Takoma Park, MD, whereas the movie takes place in a generic rural location and makes no mention of Washington, DC. This is minor and does not detract from the movie. Contrary to the trailer, this movie is not another ""Chronicles of Narnia"" or ""Harry Potter"" magic tale. It is about the struggles of growing up, learning to use imagination and courage, and being able to cope with loss. The special effects seem sparse at times, but they are not necessary for the movie's theme. Sure, Disney could have spend another 30 million dollars to add 30 more minutes of fantasy special effects, but the movie still would have ended the same way. Without a doubt, see this movie. It has very a powerful and moving message to it.",Bridge to Terabithia

As a matter of fact, lately, Disney has gotten a bad reputation for butchering movies, especially those based on books. As much as I hated the idea of the whole thing walking in, I was calling up all my friends to tell them that we had to see it together as soon as I was walking out. Both of the kids acted very well, and the story's theme stayed true throughout the whole movie. I would highly recommend seeing it, but bring tissues! A whole box of tissues!

444,hotepmojo,Disappointed and Discouraged,5,18 February 2007,"My 8 year old daughter asked me to see this movie with her. We had seen the promos on TV and it looked like a fun movie. I was expecting something along the lines of ""The Chronicles of Narnia"" as that is how the promos on TV made it appear. It couldn't have been any farther from Narnia than it was. What upset me the most, as a 46 year old American father was the misrepresentation on the TV advertisements for this movie. If she and I had known what we were going to see, I would have been prepared for the most HEARTBREAKING MOVIE I have ever seen. Was it a good movie? Yes it was. I am a pretty tough, calloused, and crusty old man, but this movie broke my heart. Not in the same way it did my daughter, but it broke it all the same. I don't know what the original story line called for, but this movie could have been done so much differently than it was. It could have left the viewer with hope instead of hopelessness. Did I like the movie? Yes. But the story broke my heart and I wouldn't watch it again. Too bad, it was such a wonderful idea. I understand what the director was trying to say and the point that was trying to be made, but real life makes that point every single day, why pour salt in the wound.

From the trailers I had assumed that it was kind of like The Never Ending Story, but I found that the trailers were terribly misleading. Since I have never read the book, I had no idea what it would really be like, but I was very pleasantly surprised. I won't get into the plot because I'm terrible at explaining plot lines well, but I hope that it will suffice when I say that I left the theater with my mind blown. I turned to my friend and was like, ""Wow, I actually want to turn around and see that again, right now."" but I couldn't because I had to go to work. It's unusual to be saying this because I normally don't like to re-watch movies so soon, but I've found that ever since I left the theater, I just want to go back. I've been trying to drag my friends there with me because I think that everyone should see this, but unfortunately, the add campaign may have ruined all chances of that happening. I find that every time I ask one of my friends to go with me, they say that there is no way they are going to watch that movie, which means I'll probably have to see it alone when I watch it again (I will definitely be watching this again). It was so good that I cried during the movie. I only remember crying in one other movie ever.Bridge to Terabithia just might be my new favorite movie.

However, the movie was quite impressive. It had an intricate plot, and kept your eyes glued to the screen. The movie shows that imagination is very important in life. Josh Hutcherson and AnnaSophia Robb are very good teen actors and really make you believe the story. This is a great movie for the family, and a truly touching story. I'm glad that the movie was able to stay so close to the book. Possilby because David Paterson, who is the son of Katherine Paterson(author of Bridge to Terabithia) wrote the screenplay.

I had only seen a few ads in passing for this movie and like many who have posted here I was expecting another Narnia. In other words I was prepared to be pretty bored. The name of the game here (surprisingly!!) is realism. Imagine my surprise in seeing kids realistically portrayed without all the hype and cultural-icon coolness abounding (no product placements!!), and parents who were true to life (warts and all) rather than idiotic cartoon characters. Not all teachers are grumpy sourpusses (and those you think are can be surprisingly human. And just as in real life, people can be mean and really, really bad things can happen to your best friend. After the movie I discussed it with my son, and was surprised to learn that he had already read the book in school. Apparently this book is very popular and is required reading in a lot of schools, so most of the kids there had read it. It appears the major plot twist was only a twist to us unsuspecting parents. My son really liked the movie, but was disappointed with the cgi graphics-- the fact that they were there at all. According to him, none of that was in the book and he did not think it should have been in the movie. Overall, it was a great story, well portrayed.",Bridge to Terabithia

I actually cried and that's like the first time I ever did in a movie. I would have given it a 10 if there was some kind of climatic ending instead of that moment. I do not recommend this movie to anyone because of the ending especially to younger children. Oh yea and I did not find much humor in it at all either. So those of you who are looking for humor , then I really don't recommend it to you. This movie is probably the worst movie ever because of one moment of it.",Bridge to Terabithia
451,biondob,"Slow, billed incorrectly, and full of antisocial lessons",1,21 February 2007,"There were so many negative aspects of this movie that I hardly know where to begin. From front to back, it was terrible -- terrible enough for me to register with IMDb just to write this review.First and foremost, it is a story with a decidedly mature main plot line, yet it is billed and rated for children. Upon seeing the trailer, my first impression was that it would be similar to Narnia; that is, a story largely about exploring the expanses of imagination, coupled with a touch of action and perhaps a few difficult situations that could easily be explained to a child from an attentive parent. The few reviews I read from critics and other IMDb users reinforced this idea through glowing grades and beaming praise.What I got was nothing of the sort. From the death of one of the protagonists, to the terrible relationship between the father and son (which by the way is never resolved), to the method by which they deal with the older children at school, to domestic abuse, to the extremely awkward and completely unwarranted discussion about damnation of KIDS, this movie was appalling to the point of absurdity. I sat bewildered at one point staring in shock as a movie theater full of 5 year olds was filled with the sound of muted crying and not-so-muted sobbing. Unbelievable.How anyone can feel good about the abject humiliation of the school bully and the utter lack of remorse by those responsible is plainly sickening. How anyone can forget the awful way Jesse's father treats him simply because he comforted Jesse in an hour of need is plainly sickening. So many values parents try to instill in their children are completely hamstrung by this story that it boggles the mind.Had it been PG-13 I still wouldn't have liked it because it happens to be the slowest movie ever written; however, I at least would have had a better idea of what to expect. As it stands right now, the only Disney movies I'll be taking my family to from this point forward are those overseen by Pixar.",Bridge to Terabithia

Tonight I was in some mysterious way traumatized. I can't begin to explain this feeling, nor could I over drinks at the local Denny's among friends after watching it, but I only know that I am now completely compelled to find something worthwhile in the book. I simply can not allow the bitter aftertaste of that movie to sit with me. I have said all that I have, not to waste your time, but to let you know just what kind of an experience may be waiting for you.As for the movie, I think their absolute worst decision was to rush the story. Had they taken the time to really deliver to the viewer just how important racing was to Jess, that it was some emotional release, some sort of coping method for his frustrating home life, and that her beating him devastated him and left a wound between them that would not easily be healed, then they might have had a good base to start with. This way the objective would be for her to subtly gain his friendship, and then bring him into her world of imagination. Out of pure laziness, I'm going to just say that they needed to have a much more powerful ending for them to 'off' the girl, who was ironically the only character that had been properly developed in the story. The boy needed more growth from the experience or something. The father wasn't done right, nor was there enough focus on his concerns to justify his influence on his son's attitude. And it was partially the flaws in the father that made Jess an insufficiently developed main character. Gabor Csupo, ease up on the bong, and stay the hell away from The Giver!",Bridge to Terabithia

454,balaenaglacialis,"""Terabithia . . . enthralls and absorbs the viewer in the magic of imagination and the reality of every-day life.",10,3 March 2007,"Review: By Morgan StewartIt is hard to put into writing just how marvelous and wonderful Bridge to Terabithia really is, yet as I attempt it, I can't help feeling disturbed at how ridiculous people are being about the marketing of this film. Thank goodness most real critics have looked past the agreeably deceptive marketing, into the heart and beauty of this film, which, with or with the misleading advertisements is impressive. After seeing it, I struggled to think of a better way of marketing this film, without giving away its ending or taking away the only audience that still seems to watch PG movies, kids.After watching it, however, I couldn't imagine taking anyone under ten to see it, nor could I imagine anyone under ten enjoying it as much as young adults, or even older audiences would. So, as deceptive as the advertising was, I myself realize that the fascinating story, the charm and skill of the actors, and the good direction of newcomer to live action film-making, Gabor Csupo, more than makes up for the slightly skewed first impressions. And I am eternally grateful that it did not turn into what everyone seemed to want, a cheesy Narnia rip-off. If anything, the movie was a lot better than the preview made it seem to be, and I was pleasantly surprised.Instead of the brash and rude approach to filming movies, that seems to be the standard today with effects driven movies, Terabithia focuses on the characters, the story, and the heart when telling this beautiful tale. Which, is part of the reason why I enjoyed it so much. Too often now days the story is built around the effects, not around the characters. A rather cumbersome and annoying way to tell a story, or be told a story, if you ask me. Instead, Terabithia uses the talents of both the amazing young actors, and its adult cast to enthrall and absorb the viewer in the magic of imagination and the reality of every-day life.The story focuses on young Jess Aarons, whose school life and home life aren't all that ideal. He deals with bullies at school, and four sisters at home. Josh Hutcherson, who I haven't particularly enjoyed before, plays the part of Jess perfectly, his emotions and reactions spot on, throughout.What is a school without the new girl? Leslie Burke, played by AnnaSophia Robb, takes on the part of the imaginative and friendly new girl and brings to Jess gifts of imagination and friendship. Robb truly does a superb job in bringing to life the thoughtful and imaginative Leslie Burke.All of the supporting cast was also brilliantly portrayed. I especially enjoyed the performances of Robert Patrick as Jess's father, and young Bailee Madison as Jess's little sister May Belle.Together, Jess and Leslie create a world to call their own. A place that no one else can get to, a place in their imaginations. Terabithia, a land of beautiful creatures and dangerous enemies, springs forth from their imaginations, and becomes a place to call their own, away from the bullies and monotony of everyday life.What really struck me as brilliant was the limited, yet still perfect number of glimpses into the children's' imaginations. We don't see a lot of Terabithia, which is good, because it is more about the journey of the characters, than the land of Terabithia. That said, it still has quite a few more scenes of adventure than the book by Katherine Patterson, all of which add to, not take away from the story.The writing, also is quite good. David Patterson, son of the novel's author takes great care when adapting the beloved work of his mother into a screenplay. Most of the lines from the book aren't there, but there are a few which make it in, revealing the care and love that was put into the scripting of this movie. Personally, I enjoy the screenplay of the movie more than the words of the book, but that is just my opinion. The movie's script greatly aided in the believability of the characters, and the motion of the scenes, which were crisp and well-planned.The movie touched on my every emotion, bringing me to tall peaks of happiness and leaving me teary-eyed and disconsolate, but still had a perfect and satisfying ending. I also, personally thought, the scenes and situations were more powerful, poignant, and realistic, than the book, which surprises me. Usually, the movie can't live up to the book. In this case, the phrase seemed switched around. The book didn't live up to the movie. As weird as it is for me to say this about a movie, Terabithia touched my heart like no film has ever before. And I doubt any film will give me quite the same feeling, ever again.",Bridge to Terabithia

My daughter is 9 and lost her father 3 years ago, and was upset for the rest of the day by this movie. She couldn't stop talking about it and was very depressed. We were both very disappointed in the movie because of this misrepresentation of what the movie was actually like. If your children are sensitive, or have experienced a recent death, this is not a good movie to see. There was very little in the plot about Terabithia.

Quite frankly it's nice to not have to sit through 3 hours of butt torture even though I love the digital effects of Weta. The creatures were cute and I think the film could have done with less time in the classroom and more in the world of Terabithia itself. I don't think the singing in the classroom or at least the repetitive back in the classroom singing bit added much to the film. Otherwise it was a good story from a well written and loved book.

It was not at all what I expected because the trailers played it out to be all about horrid creatures - looking somewhat scary. The movie is really about 2 lonely kids who are the victims of bullying at school. They form a sweet friendship - actually non sexual between a boy and a girl. Their adventures take them to a place free of bullies and helps them to cope with their daily lives which are somewhat a miserable existence. I think it will offer hope for kids who are victims of bullying and may be good to show the bullies just how deeply they can hurt someone else. My daughter says the way the school is portrayed in this film is very true to life. It may open discussion for parents to discuss this issue with their kids and give them some coping skills.,Bridge to Terabithia

462,selfless-silence,Tragedy at its finest.,10,27 May 2007,"Now, there are some really sad movies out there that you've seen, but in my lifetime of watching movies I think this one made me cry the hardest, and left the greatest impact on my life. Its been several months now and I still can't get over this movie and the image of the young girl Leslie Burke(AnnaSophia Robb)who changed a the life of a boy Jesse Aarons(Josh Hutcherson)who was struggling with his life of endless, bullying, parental neglecting, unobtainable love and sibling conflict. When I walked into the movie theater I expected another Narinia type movie, full of magic and wonder like you get from Harry Potter movies but I found myself not disappointed, the movie turned out better than expected. I have to admit the trailers were really deceiving, and that's a thumbs down from me, but the trailer has nothing to do with the movie. I've heard a lot of negative comments about this movie and that's understandable I'm opened minded to what others think, it was a really sentimentally surrounded movie. If you're more of an action type person than this movie isn't probably for you. The themes of the are primarily friendship, imagination and dealing with loss. Its an excellent movie for families, I strongly recommend it for that. Personally, I believe this movie is better than a traditional fantasy, instead it incorporated the concept of imagination as well as adding a more meaningful end. The movie is based on a novel written by Katherine Patterson, its one of the BEST and absolute best book to movie adaptations I've ever seen if not the best. It brings the general plot line as well as keeping important details into a modern day perspective from the 1970s. The modern day setting doesn't bother me if anything it makes it more relatable. The actors were absolutely terrific, Josh Hutcherson successfully portrays the depressed and lonely Jesse Aarons while AnnaSophia Robb captures Leslie's enthusiasm for life, friends and imagination. Their contrasting personalities fit well together making their friendship a more meaningful. The special effects were amazing being done by the same special effects teams of the Lord of the Rings movies. I think the special effects were really important in terms of portraying the imaginations of Leslie and Jesse to the audience it would have been redundant to watch them just play fight monsters by whacking a tree with a stick. The book was more like that, so if anything the movie is better than the book in terms of communicating imagination to the audience. I really must emphasize that AnnaSophia Robb is absolutely beautiful she really is, she gives off this innocent but fun image and I think that is important in order to make the death of Leslie Burke more tragic because the audience can more deeply admire the character. In the original book and another adaptation that was made in the 80s. Leslie Burke is portrayed as a girl looking more like a boy which turns people off in terms of her character, even though the imagine of the character is not traditionally used, her blonde hair, quirky, fun personality gives and brings Leslie more to life. I'm not a big movie critic, I don't like to give movies really bad ratings and such because every movie is different I respect that, I just go with what I feel and if the movie is simply good or not and what impact did it have on myself. This movie is a beautiful tale of friendship it really touched me, I can really relate myself. You might be disappointed when you see this movie and its not what you expect but to quote Leslie Burke from the movie, ""Close your eyes, but keep your mind wide open!"" its something that I'll never forget as if Leslie were my own friend and that's how you keep her alive.",Bridge to Terabithia

For starters, this movie isn't even remotely like Chronicles of Narnia. It's about two kids who go into a forest and start seeing things. Things that aren't really there. No, I'm not lying. I'm the same age as the kids in this movie, and I have to say, I don't go into a forest and pretend that there's trolls who look like the school bully (who's a weirdly dressed, frizzy haired girl who charges people to go to pee). Second, the movie was extremely unexplained. The girls death was very fast, I think the writer was lazy and coudn't think of a more creative way to die. People don't die from falling into a three feet deep river. Sure, you could hit your head on a rock, but this wouldn't kill her from the height of her fall. Also, there is a part where the boy's dad becomes the dark lord (who is the villain of the forest, who is actually a black blur you see between trees). This doesn't make a lot of sense, as his dad wasn't in the forest when they first spotted the dark lord. Third, cruelty to animals. During the kids pot smok-, er, imagining, they must of killed many squirrels, as they pretend they are the dark lords minions, and hit them with sticks, and a metal fist (of course imagined) at one point.Anyways, don't go see this movie, it stunk, I wish I hadn't wasted the two hours of my life.",Bridge to Terabithia

I myself was very resistant watching this movie because I figured it would be your regular badly acted kid movie, but not this one.Really, go rent or buy this movie, get some popcorn or whatever, lay back and jut let it entice you along the way. Also, try not to think too much during the movie, and keep your mind wide open :-)",Bridge to Terabithia
469,james-lofthouse-1,Great - but not for kids,8,1 May 2007,"Just want to add to Supernewb's review. The trailer is badly misleading. It makes it look like an enjoyable fantasy move - it isn't. It's a movie about bullying, and dealing with it. This a good - very good - movie. But it is absolutely not a kids' movie. On the basis of the trailer - OK, somewhat foolish, I admit - I watched this with my 4 & 5 year olds. They loved it right up to the point when ***** Major spoiler *****the girl dies. They were totally distraught and it took a lot of explaining. The performances by the 2 leads are terrific. Great movie. But not for kids.",Bridge to Terabithia

Forget all this garbage about inner child etc etc its awful, and if you liked it in America then it shows how easily please the nation must be, mediocrity is never acceptable awful awful awful film. Not only was I disgusted by the apathetic way Disney trailed the film but the people I saw it with were equally disgusted by the lack of any decent story and just random ramblings of an already weak story.We are lucky in the UK we have good authors and we have the chronicles of Narnia and Lord of the rings books to read as children, if this is the best that can follow then you can keep it",Bridge to Terabithia

The twist away from the TV trailer's portrayal however was shockingly refreshing.The two young stars of the movie gave an unprecedented performance in a movie that will enchant and captivate anybody with even the slightest imagination. At a time where fantasy movies are on top of the world, there comes a film that brings every bit of magic and wonder but with emotion and drama that is unparallelled.This is a movie that will capture the heart and mind in ways that I have never seen.And as a couple of closing comment:For those who say that this is not a family movie and that the theme of death and drama is inappropriate, can I remind you of one of the most successful family movies of my childhood, My Girl. A basic family movie with the aspect of a sudden death of a friend. No complaints and no traumatic issues when growing up (except maybe the uncomplimentary sequel).The second is for everybody who complains and moans about this not being a fantasy film.

The story revolves around the life of a 10-yr old boy who is the fastest in his school, until Leslie came and beat all the boys. Now this ain't a good way to start making friends but soon they realize that they similar in more ways they imagine. Since Jess was good at drawing and Leslie at writing stories, their imagination started a whole new world for them. And the adventures they faced in this imaginary world helped them face their problems in life. This might seem like some kind of boring value teaching story, but the truth is when i watched it i got more than what my money payed for. I actually cried, that was the first time I cried because of a movie. I wont tell you why I cried but i can tell you almost everyone in the theater was crying. Now some parents might say that its not appropriate for children to watch, but for me if your kids can understand the concept of this story they might say that this is better than ""Narnia"" or other fantasy movies.",Bridge to Terabithia
476,jcc-mgs,Probably the most entertaining movie I've ever seen. Because it was so abysmal.,1,14 July 2007,"This film, is terrible beyond human comprehension. The acting was hideous. Really, I know they're children, but I'm their age (13) and the most useless kids in our Drama class, they're about the same level as the blonde emo and the annoying boy. They run across logs, and exclaim things, and pretend stones are grenades, but why? My running commentary on the movie was far more entertaining than the movie itself. It lacked direction, religious ideals were injected at various points and they felt that they had to appeal to modern culture by dressing the girl in awful scene clothes.On the plus side, me and a friend found it highly amusing to count the scenes where she had breasts, and the ones where she didn't, that was just plain hilarity. If they'd shot all the scenes in the same time-frame that the movie is in, it wouldn't have been as bad, but she literally grows and loses them each scene. Sorry, just HAD to comment on that.The writing was pretty terrible, too.

I never read the book or watched the show. Mainly because it came out in 1972 and i was -2 when the TV aired it. But I didn't expect Leslie's death at all, and it came to me as a sudden surprise. During the shots of the water raising in the creek from the rain I just thought that it was going to get to where they just couldn't go there or something.

478,dacron2003,Wonderful film - not at all what I was expecting!,10,2 June 2007,"This movie really defied my expectations and I would agree with some comments that the advertising does not prepare you very well for the nature of the film itself. However it seems that the promotions department is just about the only element of the production team that didn't get it right (one can only assume that the advertising was done by a generic Disney team rather than the film makers themselves - it's the only trace of anything Disneyesque in the movie) This is a quite, quite wonderful movie that stays with you for a long time after the first viewing. Any connections to a Narnia type story should be forgotten as in some ways it is closer to Pans Labyrinth in the way that it deals with real world issues through escapist fantasy. Another film that it evokes is ""Stand by Me"" in that it deals with the trials and difficulties encountered by children who don't quite ""fit in"" as they grow up and the importance (and depth) of childhood friendships.The focus is on the young lead characters but this in no way means that it is a specifically children's movie. It is rather a true family movie that adults will enjoy just as much and in some ways the depth of emotion will be lost on young children (recommended for 10+). The director shows how the worlds of the adults and children brush against each other with great insight and subtlety. This is a really well crafted piece of cinema where the pictures and images convey the reality of family life rather than sentimental dialogue.The ""look"" of the film is excellent, with first class editing and cinematography. The quality of the acting from the young leads is outstanding and the director has done an excellent job in extracting such natural and honest performances from them. The writing is also restrained and well crafted with no gushing or indulgent sentimentality. For all its reference to imaginative escapism - it is the moments of reality that really hit home.At a time when Hollywood seems bereft of ideas and is simply churning out lame franchise sequels this is an excellent exception that really deserves a much larger audience. A word of caution to parents: don't watch this without a child - you'll need them to hold your hand all through the final third of this impressive movie!",Bridge to Terabithia
479,apease-3,Very badly promoted - Situations outside of the fantasy were not realistic,5,17 July 2007,"I never read the book, but I saw the original TV movie produced in 1985 in school, and knew the original story was about a boy who's friend dies. From all of the advertisements I thought someone had stolen the name from the original story and then made up their own fantasy.Fortunately it wasn't as bad as that. The theme of the story is actually consistent with the 1985 version, and is done pretty well.What I mostly did not like was the unbelievable portrayal of home and school life.1) The boy is from a poor family. On the day of a big race at school, the boy's mother decides to throw away his worn out shoes and make him wear pink, girl's hand-me-down sneakers, to school. The boy's father goes along with this. Talk about cruel parents. Would anyone here ever be that mean to your kids?2) As he gets on the bus, an older girl throws food at the boy which sticks to his shirt. The bus driver does nothing. Such behavior would never have been tolerated on the buses I rode to the school. Yet later in the movie this same girl trips and falsely accuses the boy to the bus driver, and without even questioning the incident the boy is immediately kicked off the bus.3) At the school, the same older girl who threw the food on the bus is charging kids to use the bathroom. Where are all of the teachers? Why is this behavior being allowed?This seems to be typical with Disney movies. Normal adult supervision tends to be conveniently absent to enable someone to be bullied for the story, in situations where that would be criminal negligence in a real life situation.",Bridge to Terabithia

This movie was shown on a plane I was on yesterday and I had left my headphones in my suitcase, and since I am too cheap to pay the $5 for horrible airline headphones, I decided to watch the film without the sound. I totally followed the storyline, and in fact, think I enjoyed the movie MORE because I wasn't distracted by dialogue and music that is only there to make up for what can't be told by the director or through acting. Furthermore, I had the opportunity to be more engaged in the film since I had to pay attention to what was happening and try to read the storyline based on the characters actions and reactions. Anyway, you can really see who is a great actor and who is a piece of wood on screen this way. Both of the leads were done very well. Which actors do you think were also good?",Bridge to Terabithia

This is a film that lives up to the ""PG"" rating, parents, check out the film as a whole before showing it to your kids.Throughout the film, a connection is developed between the viewer and the two main characters, this adds impact to the events that happen in the film, you will find yourself laughing, crying and sympathizing with the characters as events unfold.People of all ages will find this film moving, it shows two contrasting characters from contrasting backgrounds finding a common place in which to develop as individuals. It's quite shocking (I know almost the entire theater I was in was crying) when Leslie dies towards the end and I was surprised to find I was feeling the emotions I did.There are lots of lessons in this film, everyone will take something positive away from it, even if it's just the inspiration to imagine.This film is definitely not your traditional fantasy, you'll be disappointed if you approach it with any preconceived ideas, it is sad, happy and terrible all at once, the actors and crew demonstrated fantastic skill in the shooting and composition of this film.Before and during watching this film, ""keep your mind wide open"" and you will find some profound ideas expressed.",Bridge to Terabithia

When I realised this, my expectations changed and I became involved emotionally in this story. The strength wasn't in CGI but in the power of imagination, and the relationships and dynamics that unfold throughout the story.

There's only a couple of scenes tastefully used to help immerse you into the children's thoughts. The film is about friendship, love, compassion and imagination and it was fun to watch. I really enjoyed it and my daughter loved it.The one thing I would mention is that there are contexts of this movie that will generate deep questions from your kids so be prepared.

The big troll was funny. We were surprised at the Giant that looked like Janice (or Janet); her head was so big compared to her body. Then the rope broke, and that is how Leslie drowned. But when she died, we kept thinking it was a mistake. How could she have died? The movie was never presented in a serious or sad way, based on the previews.

I downloaded the movie.First 30 min of movie was amazing: two main characters using power of imagination to create their very own world! Was very cool. And you can predict the end of the movie : fantasy will come true or something else will happen, but you know for sure that everybody will be well and healthy at the end....... Right? RIGHT? ..... WRONG!!!! SO WRONG! At the end of the movie one of two main characters getting lame and pointless death from the writer!-""There is a female character. You will like her.""- Huh? Oh. I liked her alright till she died! 13 years old girl was playing in the forest, fall of from the rope and died? How messed up is this? The story: two good friends, one of them accidentally died, and of story!!! Stuff like this happening every day in real life, I do not want to see it on the big screen! I watch movies to survive in this messed up world! I wanna see ""happy end"". I wanna see something inspiring and giving hope. And what I got? Death of the 13 years old female main character. It took me ""13 Going On 30"" (2004) and newest episode of ""Smallville"", to be able finally fall a sleep at 4:00 of the morning. (not before I called to Russia to that friend of mine, and told her that I am coming back to Russia as soon as possible just to kick her butt for that set up!)Conclusion: If your never heard about ""Therabithia"" before (like myself), do not watch that movie! I repeat DO NOT WATCH IT! Even if you will find used DVD with that movie for 0.10 USD on Flea market, do not buy it!

You should make it that Lesley comes back to life and the dark master is actually them bully's. And Jesse is the knight that comes to find Lesley in a desperate search. But when he goes there they are on the dawn of war with the dark master and Terabithia. Terabithia wins the war but Jesse is not done with his search he breaks into the dark master throne room and overthrows him. he finds Lesley in a jail and breaks her out. They then make a stand and fight the last remaining goons the next morning they meet back up with there families and go back to school but thats all i can think of and my other thoughts are that its one very tragic movie.,Bridge to Terabithia

Josh Hutcherson is one potential up and comer the same goes for AnnaShophia Robb, well done to the rest of the cast as well. when i started watching this i thought that the use of fantasy would be applied in the same way that it was applied in The chronicles of narnia... i turned off my TV thinking something different. perhaps we are to see more success in the years to come!congrats to all the film crew.",Bridge to Terabithia

493,peaceoutguevera,A unique movie that captures the imagination of childhood - beautiful and profound,10,7 December 2007,"Originally the only thing I knew about this movie was that Zooey Deschanel was in it, one of my favorite actresses. I had always put off watching it because it is a children's movie, but I was given the opportunity to view it when I was looking after some children. I admit that I made the assumption beforehand that it was ""just a children's movie"", and along with the description of fantasy, kids fighting ogres and monsters, and magical castles, it would not be the kind of movie I would want to watch.Boy was I wrong. Yes, it's a children's movie, but the messages in it are beautiful and profound, and can and are applied to the struggles and heartbreaks of everyday life, and especially, how we deal with those difficulties. The story centers around the friendship of a young boy and a young girl, both who have had their fair share of difficulties in life, one being finding lasting friendship. They bond through their need to escape ordinary life, and delve into their own fantasy world where there are beautiful castles, rolling hills, endless sunshine, and one or two foes to defeat. This fantasy world is their own way of dealing with what life throws at them - for Leslie (the talented AnnaSophia Robb), it's trying to fit in and finding somewhere she belongs, as well as the feeling of loneliness from being an only child with parents who are working 24/7; and for Jesse (Josh Hutcherson), it's dealing with feeling excluded from his family, and feeling alone at school and dealing with bullies.Special mention has to go to AnnaSophia Robb, who portrays Leslie perfectly and with an air of enthusiasm you cannot fake; blue-eyed Zooey Deschanel who plays Leslie and Jesse's teacher, with her beautiful singing voice and wonderful manner around children; and last but not least, young Bailee Madison, who plays Jesse's sister May Belle, who put on a magnificent performance unseen from someone so young.If you focus on the fantasy/imaginative aspect of the film you will lose sight of the real messages, all of which are most definitely profound. Leslie and Jesse find in each other a true friend, whilst each discovering just how special and unique they really are. Throw into the mixture some school bullies who have problems of their own, Jesse's innocent crush on his music teacher, Ms. Edmonds (Zooey Deschanel), and of course, the incredible CGI and beautiful music, you'll have a movie that will stay with you for a very long time.",Bridge to Terabithia

The film tries to explore the realms and depth of a child's imagination but fails due to the complete lack of originality in creating an imaginary world and the pure sycophantic focus of the film takes away any pleasure the viewer may have from enjoying a , technologically well created world.Then again it depends what flicks your switch, if you enjoy senseless tearjerkers with cute little boys and cute little girls in an environment (if you can get into it) that will make feel emotions such as happiness and sadness (which you may not normally feel) then this is the ideal movie for you to ooh and aah at, and make your weekend a better one.",Bridge to Terabithia

I can't even believe that this movie was ever made. Its the single worst movie i've ever seen. I sat through movies like Bend It Like Beckham and The Sisterhood of Traveling Pants and i thought those were bad. But i never thought that a movie could ever aggravate me so much for wasting that hour and a half or however long it was. The fact that movie critics watched this and didn't slap the director for wasting their time amazes me. The fact that anyone even thought it was a good idea to spend money on making this amazes me as well. This movie should have never made it to theaters let alone to home video. If i could have ranked this movie lower than a 1 i would have. I've seen home videos that didn't cost a dime that were better than this. Now seeing this movie makes me question the author of the book as well. This story isn't worth the paper it was written on. Even for a kids movie this doesn't even deserve a 1. It's not even imaginative and the character depth was terrible as well. They didn't develop any characters besides the weird little girl, the other main character, and that's about it. The best character was the strict father who told the boy to get his head out of the clouds. If the kid would have just listened it would have ended the pain a whole lot sooner. Hands down, the worst movie ever made, and believe me I watched a movie called Terror Toons and was more entertained.",Bridge to Terabithia
501,embyrdragon,this is a horribly sad movie,4,26 January 2008,"i think that this movie was OK. it was cute at the beginning, its really cute, but the end is really really sad. at the beginning, you see that he loves to run and is not the most popular kid in school. he had no friends. then, a new girl came. they created a whole new world with their imagination. near the end, the new girl died, the unpopular guy hurt his little sister's feelings very badly. then he took her to the imaginary world and she imagined a new world. also, the new girl, Leslie, who is now dead, was also not a popular girl and had no friends before she moved. the unpopular guy, jess, didn't got along with his at all. so, it is an extraordinarily sad movie but it has a few happy moments.",Bridge to Terabithia
502,shanevcovell,Great on so many levels,10,21 February 2008,"This movie may be one of the most moving films I have ever seen. Not only for Leslie's death (which was handled very well) but for the very moving family values messages included within. Those who think the father was neglectful are clueless. Look at how he treated his son. He loved the boy dearly, but, in a household with 5 women, he treated his son like a man. You could see it in how the father spoke, and how he looked at his son. Even when he was angry, the anger carried the love of a father. It shows the difference between a modern family and a traditional rural/farming family. On the farm, the men have to be able to deal with anything and everything that comes at them. And both father and son were strong male characters, who put their family before themselves. As for the Christian brainwashing (The kids believing that if you don't swear by the bible, you go to hell) it is another commentary on rural life. The Church is still a very major part of many rural lives folks, and their belief system (which we may or may not agree with) is what gets them through the rough years. God or no God, they live happier and simpler lives because of these beliefs.",Bridge to Terabithia

I just wasn't' prepared for it, and also believe that your children under 10 might not be as well.

Bad plot progression and almost nothing to do with ""Terabithia"" which is the title of the movie! The acting is so-so by most of the characters and it seems like the movie is just a glorified indie film, almost feels thrown together and cheap like when you saw Home Alone 4 or the Second Richie Rich.

This was such a great movie. And btw im not really annasophia, shes just my idol. U have this 10 year old typical elementary boy Jess Aarons {Josh Hutcherson} who has a love for drawing and running. Yet he is bullied at school, and has no friends. All that changes when a girl named Leslie Burke{AnnaSophia Robb} moves next door. At first, Jess wants nothing to do with Leslie after she beats Jess and a few other boys racing. Then the two create the land of Terabithia and become the best of friends. It's all good until Jess hears that *spoiler* Leslie died trying to get to terabithia. He misses her very much and makes his younger sister May Belle {the adorable Bailee Madison} princess. This movie really brings out your imagination and makes u think u can achieve anything. The whole theater was filled with crying.

About the book: I did not read it, but when you read any book, you won't be sad as you are when you watch a movie. I wanted to say that you won't cry after the book, but movie...

The plot, which I should warn will be spoilt if you read on, focuses on two socially awkward school children, Jesse and Leslie, who become friends and create a fantasy land of their own called Terabithia. In this land they can escape the reality of their home lives and school life. The main focus of the film is of loss, however, as about two thirds into the film Leslie is killed in an accident. The remainder of the film is about Jesse coming to terms with her death.I cannot accurately put into words how beautiful, tragic, heart-warming and 'tear-jerking' (to use an awful expression) this films is, but suffice is to say it is highly recommended.

It's not that I feel as though my child should be shielded from death, but he really was lulled into trusting the sustainability of the friendship between these two young people and then she was abruptly killed off. I'm sure there were all sorts of life lessons learned in the book, but as a child marketed movie it came across as gratuitous, manipulative and cruel.

The acting was great. Even though I hated that his best friend and his only friend died it was a GREAT story. Not sure if this is really meant for young kids as I don't think they would really understand the message the story brings nor do I believe they would be interested in the movie.

You may ask ""why is it funny?"" Well first off its about kids swinging across a 3ft deep river and then imaging monsters that they fight off. I never really understood if the monsters were real or not though, which brings me to the second reason i thought it was funny. Out of no where they just decided to randomly kill off the main girl character. The reason its funny is because it comes literally out of no where. Its like if in Iron Man he was just flying around after he killed the main bad guy and had a heart attack and died. That's about how pointless this death was. The best part is how she died though, the rope broke and she drowned... But the water was only 3ft deep. They also made it sound like the imaginary monsters took her of some load of crap. So im not really sure how the eff she died it was pretty unclear. Also they have a dog that would go with them across the river, how the hell did the dog swing across on the rope? Did they kick the little bastard across the river or did he swim? Because in every scene they're holding on to the rope with two hands as they go across. Eff it maybe hes a super dog and can fly that fit just perfectly into this cluster eff of a movie.",Bridge to Terabithia

Disney should be ashamed for its trailer, which shows this as being a fun, fantasy-type movie along the lines of Harry Potter or Narnia. It is NOT.The story is wonderful, if you know what to expect. If you are expecting to see a fantasy, it is a major disappointment. Do NOT take young children to see this show without reading the book or seeing the movie yourself first. It deals with children growing up and having to face the harsh realities of life, and it may very well be too intense for your kids. It was almost too intense for me.

The story is one that anyone can relate to, and is endlessly endearing. Needless to say, I was highly skeptical when I read that Disney would be distributing a new feature film version, especially after seeing the trailer. Thankfully, my fears were far from justified. Note, the movie is nothing like that trailer, and is in fact highly faithful to the source material. The special effects scenes are only a handful of shots throughout the film, and they are very blatantly explained to be an animation of what is taking place in the character's minds.Speaking of the characters, Josh Hutcherson and AnnaSophia Robb outshine everyone else on the screen, giving truly believable performances as Jesse and Leslie, bringing the characters to life in a remarkable way, and showing talent far beyond their years.One thing to point out, without any spoilers, is that this movie, like the book, hits a very dark point. Be forewarned that it can be very sad.Overall, I would say the movie is highly faithful to the book, and anyone who has enjoyed this great story as much as I have will thoroughly enjoy the film...",Bridge to Terabithia

I really wanted to see this movie, and as it was sold through the preview, I was hoping for a movie akin to the Never Ending story. Instead, you get mere glimpses at a magical world, just barely enough so that you can imagine a movie that could have been made, the movie that you in fact were expecting. I don't care about kids in a tree house, I wanted to see them ""step through the wardrobe"" but with less Christianity shoved down my throat. It doesn't help matters that due to the complete misrepresentation of the movie, I now am no longer allowed to pick any movies that we go to see. Thanks a lot Bridge of Terabithia.

I usually don't enjoy movies based on books that I have read, but this is an exception in that category. I think that the children in this movie acted amazingly well through some emotional scenes.

521,recl,Why did this movie appeal to Disney?,6,7 May 2007,"In the UK 'Bridge opened at the same time as Spiderman 3. Many children were taken by their unconcerned parents to see this 12A - rated movie, only to find it sold out on its opening weekend. So...they took them in to see 'Bridge.Nearly everyone who left the theatre after its showing left distraught. Those children who perhaps should never have been taken to see Spiderman, certainly shouldn't have seen 'Bridge. I heard a few parents mutter that they would never take their children to see a Disney movie again.The first impression of this movie isn't sufficient - there is a subtext - and it has to be recognised (who is this girl who can catch sunbeams in a church?) Why though did it appeal to Walden/Disney? The novel was published in 1977, originally as a means by his mother to help her son David Paterson get over a tragedy. Thirty years later David Paterson, after completing the original draft of the script, saw his mothers work make it to the big screen.In that time though, things have changed a little in the world.It's hard not to be cynical about this - but a quick review of the movie in the current corporate environment is justified.Leslie and Jess - two children who don't exactly fit the pure stereotype of modern US children eh? One lives in a family that doesn't even own a TV (not likely to be signing-up to the Disney Channel then). The other doesn't belong to a family that's likely to contribute much to any firms profit margin. They explore woods, run everywhere...build tree houses...invent with imaginations that have no genesis in the Devils phone (with graphics). Coming back from school - they play outside - for hours and hours. No slumping in front of the TV for these two.These two kids are completely at odds with what corporate God-fearing America wants - neither are going to be likely good consumers.So...one of them is killed, in a accident outside, out in the woods...Now wouldn't that appeal to your modern corporate executive, disturbed by the concept that American children could be inclined to enjoying a traditional childhood - without (couldn't bear the thought) the constant accompaniment of the TV? Fun and games outside? What a horrible thought. Keep you children indoors, where they will be safe and sound, preferably in front of the TV.Unduly paranoid? OK, I'll accept that.But think, how did someone manage to pitch this film to the Disney executives - what in the storyline appealed to them? I don't think it was sufficient to say ""Its a classic novel, it has to be filmed"".I'll be willing to accept I'm wrong if Disney commission a sequel that features the mysterious reappearance of an adventurous and brave young girl - or even a re-filmed (Peter Jackson-style) alternate ending option for the (most likely lowest-selling of recent times) DVD release. Would Disney bite the bullet? I dunno. David Paterson would have reason to be annoyed. But hang on - ""alternate endings"" aren't so unusual. Look at The Natural (1984) a film that strangely shares the same sense of wonder with 'Bridge - and compare the downbeat Bernard Malamud novel with the distinctly cathartic movie.",Bridge to Terabithia

Based on the trailers, I was afraid in making the movie more ""kid-friendly"" they might have sidelined the relationship between the boy and girl in lieu of overly done CG effects.Though there were creatures and effects, they were minor in comparison to a character movie that focused on that which mattered most. If you compared the time spent with a few creatures to the time spent developing the relationships between the characters, creatures hardly made a dent.I was pleasantly pleased that they stuck to the original, though sad, plot because that is what made the movie real.

That said, I look forward to similar exceptional quality work from Disney in the future as well as from the young actors who performed so brilliantly. My 17 year old daughter was similarly impressed.

There are definitely parts of the film that are strictly kid-friendly, but overall I think that almost anyone of any age will enjoy it. It's Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, and Chronicles of Narnia wrapped in well lighted and photographed paper.

The imagination these kids have is also good but the movie makes you wonder where every thing is headed. It has a slow beginning with an even slower middle.

531,stankunasj,Impressive Performance from Josh and AnnaSophia!,9,16 February 2007,"I just saw the movie today, and I fell in love with it. It's a movie about two friends, Jess (Josh Hutcherson) and Leslie (AnnaSophia Robb), who meet and become very good friends. They both get picked on at school, and decide to make their own world so they can forget about what happens to them at school. Leslie takes Jess across a river and into a forest. They see a tree-house and it becomes their place. With their imagination, they create a world, Terabithia, with magical creatures. Their friendship grows more and more every day.Then, Jess gets a call from his teacher, who he has a crush on, to go to an art museum. While he is passing Leslie's house, he thinks about taking her, but since he was SO in love with the teacher, he passed on the idea. When he gets back, he finds his family in tears, and his father tells him that Leslie died trying to get past the river. Jess had to deal with it, and finally got the love from his father that he never had. His father was never really kind to him, and payed more attention to his sisters. Jess starts to build a bridge to get to Terabithia, and when he is done, he crowns his little sister as princess.This movie was amazing, and was a real tear jerker. The only problem is that I wanted to see a little bit more action with Terabithia, but when the dramatic twist came in, I fell in love. That replaced the action that I wanted to see. This movie must be seen by everyone, so they can fall in love with it, just like I did. 9/10.Josh Hutcherson and AnnaSophia Robb were amazing in the film, and they will definitely go far after this film. Two teenage actors can make an amazing performance, and if you see Bridge To Terabithia, you'll see what I mean. KUDOS Josh and AnnaSophia!",Bridge to Terabithia

533,searsdp,beautiful,10,18 February 2007,"I have wanted to see a movie made out of this book since I first read it back in the 1996-1997 school year (my fifth grade year). I am glad I waited, and kept interest in the book, because now I not only love the book, but also the movie as well. The actors did brilliantly in portraying their characters, and I think there is just great about this movie. It is truly true to the book, and yet it adds enough space where the characters were able to fit in their personalities. I thought that the cast did great and this met my expectations, that have been building ever since they announced this two years ago! The characters were basically how I pictured them being when I first read the book 10 years ago, and thus I have to say that this is a fantastic movie.",Bridge to Terabithia

I wouldn't say it did entirely, since movies made from books rarely do,but it wasn't that far off the mark. My son 7 enjoyed it too, He may have been a tad too young for it. There were some great family discussion topics that I did my best to address with my son after the movie, but felt he may have been too young to get the full benefit of the discussions. I don't want to give away any thing so I apologize for being vague about the ""topics"".One thing that I think made a great impact on him was that it was about playing outside and using your imagination, things we don't see/hear about to much anymore in these days.

Bullied, they seek their own refuge from the world in the form of their own kingdom, Terabithia.I read a comment about this movie not being for children, and I have to say, I totally disagree. I think this movie is wonderful for adults and children alike. It deals with some major issues in new and creative ways. Jess and Leslie deal with their problems by recreating them in an imaginary world where they can be the things they aren't in real life. This gives them the strength to deal with them in the real world.The more serious issues are handled in a way that parents can appreciate as not too ""adult"" for their children, and children as not too ""grown-up"" for them to grasp.Fans of the book will be happy to know that CGI effects do not overshadow the themes of the book, and though they make up a large part of the trailer, they actually make up less than a third of the movie.Kids and adults, be warned : bring the tissues.",Bridge to Terabithia

Then out of nowhere the story takes a horrible unexpected UNNECESSARY turn that totally ruins the movie. It tries but fails to make up for it after. Just horrible horrible.It also fails to explore the fantasy world more than it actually does. It only just scrapes the surface where it could've gone so much further (down the rabbit hole).Most of the characters in the movie are good, but some are unnecessary and should've been left out completely. They only take up space where there should've been more fantasy world exploration.",Bridge to Terabithia

There was virtually no magic world as they saw in the commercials and the terrible ending left them bawling literally for a couple of hours after the movie. They still both cry when they even see the trailer or ads for the home release etc. We went out for a nice evening together to enjoy a Disney film and we wound up extremely disappointed. We even skipped dinner and just went straight home as they were so upset by it. Totally ruined our outing and still has them shook up over one month later. This is two strikeouts in a row for Disney with us as nobody here liked Cars even remotely either (and this does NOT count all the violence and death in the Narnia movie - my kids are not allowed to see it). Cars was WAY too grown up for the kids with all the dialogue and held their interest for about five minutes. Not enough fun anymore...why not Toy Story 3 already?! Disney has lost a ton of credibility with us. Last good movie they had that wasn't Pixar was ????.

For those of you that don't know, this movie was produced by the son of the author. The author wrote this book to help her son (producer) get through the unexpected death of his best friend (an 8 year old girl). It does have a very heavy religious theme. However,the religious theme runs through the book and is only mentioned in the movie. The fantasy scenes are not in the book at all. This is a bonus the director gives us. It is very sad and will leave younger children sobbing for hours. All of this being said, it is well made and stays true to the book.

540,nanesahakyan,What is more realistic- Terabithia or the world on the other side of the bridge?,10,27 September 2015,"Everyone probably experienced this during childhood- the uncertain border between the real and imaginary world, when the imagined world might seem you more realistic than the real one. I remember my imaginations of my childhood and I now follow my daughter creating imaginary worlds herself.Bridge to Terabithia is a marvelous movie about childhood, imagination, love and attachment.Young Jess Aarons is not very happy about his life. At home he deals with four sisters, at school he has no friends. He is a very good painter, but no one has told him about that. But one day she meets Leslie Burke- a new student in his school, a very bright and shiny girl with a charming smile and charming personality. She grew up in a very different family than Jess did. Her parents know almost everything about her life (they even know that Jess is a good painter) they encourage her to be bright and to be different. She is not only a good runner but also knows how to deal with problems at school. But most importantly she knows how to make up stories, and how to imagine. She helps Jess to do the same. Jess has the skill and they make up the story, their world together- a fascinating, beautiful world- Terabithia.Jess's little sister also can see Terabithia maybe a little bit different, with purple flowers. Terabithia is there for everyone who is a child, who has the fascinating imagination of little ones. My review was about the story. All the other things of the movie (filming, acting, etc) is good as well. But the movie is more about the story that will make you smile and maybe move you to your own Terabithia for a second.",Bridge to Terabithia
541,idolz_the_unknown,Discover a Story That Will Never Leave You and a Movie That Will Change You Forever!,10,18 March 2007,"On Wednesday, March 14th, 2007, my family and I went to a local movie theatre to see a movie. My younger brother who is nine-years-old demanded for us to see the Bridge to Terabithia. Honestly, I was quite reluctant to see the movie at first, due to the poster and trailer for the movie, which seemed overly fantasy-oriented for me. However, I thought that I would give it a go. It turns out that while the poster and trailer for the movie only focused on the fantasy aspect of the film, in reality that wasn't what the movie was basically about. The story mainly consisted of self-respect, anguish, isolation, friendship, school and family tension, death, open-mindedness, and imagination. I love the ending because it sends a message saying that even if you lose a loved one, you can never lose your imagination, where love and laughter can live on forever.Also, I think that Josh Hutcherson played Jesse very well, but sometimes I feel as if I would have played Jesse very well also, if not better. The reason for this is because while Josh had admitted to be quite different from Jesse and has gotten to put Jesse away, I don't think that I would ever get the chance to put Jesse away if I was cast to be Jesse in the movie. In fact, if I was Jesse in the film I don't think that I would even put my acting abilities in good use, because I feel that I am Jesse. You know what I mean? Just like Jesse, I am in elementary school, I love to run and draw, I have a restrained relationship with my father, I tend to be very introverted, I tend to have my head in the clouds, I create new worlds because I think that the real one is too harsh at times, I get bullied in school, I used to have a family that was struggling with money, I don't make friends very easily, I've lost a friend before, and so on and so forth.I must admit that I've never cried during any movie, but this movie had me going! Actually, I didn't cry during the movie, but after stepping out of the movie theatre, I was completely overwhelmed and heartbroken with this movie. The next night, after thinking about the similarity between Jesse and I in terms of personality and experiences, that's when the tears started falling down. It was just so incredibly heartfelt to see ""myself"" on a movie theatre screen with my personality and my experiences. Even to this day, I cannot seem to get that movie out of my mind. I feel like that movie portrayed major segments of my life, and thinking about it is just like thinking about my own life!In conclusion, I must say that this movie sticks out, compared to many other movies that I have seen, and I've also been thinking if there's absolutely anyone out there who would listen and respect my opinions and feelings based on the story. In the past I've always wished for a movie that I could truly relate to, and my wish has been answered with an even better answer than I expected.I strongly encourage anyone who is interested in the above-mentioned characteristics to see this complete masterpiece.The Bridge to Terabithia will have a place in my heart - always.P.S. I can never thank my little brat brother enough! I wish that there were more movies like the Bridge to Terabithia that he can drag me into!",Bridge to Terabithia
542,vasi075,Be wary,1,5 January 2008,"The movie was well made, of course, with excellent acting, sets, music, all the stuff that makes a fantasy good. It is marketed as a children's movie; I would never allow my children to watch it. I also object to having my emotions manipulated; I also don't like movies where an animal dies for the sole affect of emotional manipulation, and that is all it was in this movie; and just a bit worse.The girl is the hero; charming, smart, self assured and confident. The boy is nice but insecure. Strong female characters and weak male characters typify the new Disney trend, and also most of television. I'm merely stating what I see as the trend.So, we all know what happened to our hero; and that was tragic enough on its own. What about our boy? He is left with horrible, guilt. Should a child have to endure this burden? See the trend again? The boy is left with guilt because he wanted to do something on his own without the girl; in other words he wanted to interact with the real world, he wanted to be a man. All he wanted was some freedom, some independence to go his own way, do his own thing. Disney seems to despise men, or boys who want to be men; they seem to want 'girl power.' The boy had a real life, the girl's life was a fantasy; which is going to get you through this adventure in reality? The boy outgrew his need for the fantasy, if he ever had a need for such a life. The girl completely dominated and controlled him, even his thoughts. So, he explored the real world without her and with tragic results.The boy did nothing wrong, and yet Disney seems to want to make him pay for the accident is some way. Lesson to boys from Disney: ""She is your master."" Our boy seems to have learned the hard way, and he pays a terrible price.I wonder what boys see in this movie? Did anyone comfort him? I don't remember for sure, but I don't recall anyone telling him that he did nothing wrong. Instead he has penance to pay for his crime of wanting to interact with the real world, to develop his mind, to pursue his own real interest and not live in a fantasy world.Many will no doubt hate me for what I wrote here, but think about it, please. I am not saying girls/women are not smart and capable; I am saying that I don't like boy/men being made to feel guilty and inferior because they have different goals and desires.Do not let your children watch this move.",Bridge to Terabithia

Movies like this one usually make you wonder about the harsh reality that things can be very accidental in life. Meeting a new person (Leslie) that shares with you many traits and becomes your best (maybe only friend) is really a long and hard-to-accept process, especially to young boys (Jess) or girls who have to struggle with life at school, home. Yet when the two becomes really close friends to each other (Jess finally accepts Leslie into his life), reality strikes out of nowhere. That part would make you cry and the part later shows you how he would cope with that lifetime incident and go on. It's beautiful because it displays how much friendship can hold if it's a true one. To people like myself (who enjoy movies for its plot despite anything else), you'll love and learn a lot from this amazing movie.",Bridge to Terabithia

The fantasy part of the movie could be watched in the trailers, for that is all that is shown in the movie. I gave the movie a poor rating because I went hoping to watch show that reflected the trailer, but instead it was a slow drawn out love story. It was good if that is what you were looking for. The acting was fine, but I don't see children wanting to sit through 90 minutes of plot development. There was a subplot involving the boy and his father where they had a ruff relationship. I didn't see why this was necessary. Children would be uncomfortable with it, it didn't seem to go anywhere, and only adults might see how it contributed to the boys desire to find a fantasy world.",Bridge to Terabithia

Therefore, seeing the movie was like experiencing the story all over again. I DO think this is a good movie for children 10+. Like I already mentioned I was 11 when I read the book for the first time and I remember it having quite a positive impact on me. I didn't remember the novel or what it was about, however I did remember that it touched me in a way that very few books ever did. Kids 10+ need to see this movie.Death is not something to fear.

They also managed to be cute without being cloying. The boy who played Jesse was amazing.

554,cybermystpage,"Could Have Been Magical, Spoiled By Fantasy",4,19 January 2020,"If you've read the book, you come away from the movie disappointed. They attempted to create a children's fantasy movie when in fact the book is more aimed at deeper subjects, exploring young love, family dynamics, and dealing with unexpected tragedy. While the book also explored imagination, it did not go so deep into fantasy to actually create the stories that the movie did. The book has a more dark emotional sense, where as the movie is like ""Chronicle of Narnia"" getting dragged into it.While the movie got the part correct where Jess goes with his teacher to the city, it completely ruined the way that he found out about Leslie. In the movie, Jess comes home to a mourning loving family who pulls him into the fold. In the book, one of Jess's sisters is the first one to speak as he returns from the city, blurting out ""Your girlfriend's dead, and momma thought you was dead too"". It cut straight to the bone, I will never forget that feeling, the wind knocked out of me, as the reader. I can think of very few books/stories that affected me the same way. Where The Red Fern Grows comes to mind, as does The Scarlet Ibis. They are stories that define the emotional limits of your own imagination as you read them, with certain sections or phrases never forgotten, as long as you live.I read this book in the fifth grade, and I will never forget the line Jess's sister utters when he returned home. When I was younger, I thought it was snide and hateful, but in recent year I've grown to wonder if I read too much into that. Regardless, the fact that the one line I remembered more than any other was NOT in the movie is enough to rate this movie down. The over reach on the fantasy is the rest of the reason why. The acting is very good by the principle two, Josh Hutcherson (Jess) and AnnaSophia Robb (Leslie), and Robert Patrick was a great choice for the gruff and hard father. Can't fault that.I would say that despite giving the movie four stars, it is worth seeing. But read the book afterwards, NOT before. And if you've already read the book, well, you're going to question a lot of scenes in the movie, much like I did. The book was not a fantasy genre, the movie shouldn't have been either.",Bridge to Terabithia
555,pinobeppe,"A shallow, uninteresting attempt at a movie based two elements: child imagination and unexpected tragedy",1,23 September 2007,"Countryside. A young boy and a young girl, living next door. He has troubles in all aspects of life: a poor family which has little to give, bullied as school. She is more fortunate at home - cool, successful parents - so she better tolerates to be bullied at school. The two quickly become best friends. So far, the movie is just average.Now there the first of the two elements of the story: the two elect a piece of wood as an imagined magical world of their own, where they are king and queen. We get to see this world though their imaginative eyes - elves and trolls and whatever. Part of this world clearly mimics the rest of their real lives.Problem is, the movie fails miserably at this element. The world is rather uninteresting, and totally unlike a world imagined by a child. No room for self humor, or exaggeration, or details. Everything is too simple. Both children, but especially her, are far, far too wise. They never really let go of themselves. That's just a lot more boring that any made-up world is supposed to be. Compare with Calvin and Hobbes fantasies. *That* is how a world imagined by a child can look like.The movie here also starts to focus the interior struggle between ""let imagination rule"" and ""get out of your Peter Pan syndrome"". The former wins. The movie fails miserably here too: maybe characters are just too flat for that. Fact is, the struggle just look stupid, excessively stylized and plain straightforward.So, now is the time for the second main element of the plot: tragedy strikes. Unexpectedly, she has a random accident and dies. How will everybody, and especially he, react to this? Not too bad, after all. Everybody is just a little sad, her family moves, then life goes on.This tragedy element has little connection with the previous one, and seems just a strong element inserted at random in an attempt to add flavor to this insipid movie. Failure, again. For the second time, character are probably just too flat to produce anything interesting at this point. For an example of a really touching movie that believably and profoundly depicts the tragedy of a missing child, see ""Stanza del figlio"", by Moretti. The comparison is embarrassing.Summary: the movie is based on two elements with huge potential: unchecked imagination (interesting, full of artistic potential) and death of a child (deeply moving, full of emotional potential). But does a terrible job on both, and at mixing them.",Bridge to Terabithia

It not that kind of movie at all. It is the story of small town kids, that happens to have a few elements of fantasy thrown in now and then. The special effects are used sparingly, so I think anyone who has read the book will be glad to know that effects are not the majority of this movie, nor do those sequences dominate the plot.

There wasn't much activity in or about Terabithia except at the very end of the movie.

Last, The death of the girl. When the girl drowns in the creek, I was shocked. I had tears flowing down my face. It was very sad and I really wasn't expecting this twist.

Leslie, his new next-door neighbor--is an aberration from his usual classmates. She is the child of free-thinking parents who don't have a television, and don't really conform to the social norm of their new locale.Through a series of events that loom gigantic to small children--such as races at recess--Leslie and Jessie eventually become friends. They cross a creek and in what can only pass as a modest structure (on the ground) they create a kingdom called Terabithia. It has fairies, and eventually a princess, but not body armor, sastsquatch, and many, many other cgi wonders that really have no business in this powerfully quiet story about grief and the rural setting it was written in.I find it truly disturbing that this--quite possibly the best book in children's literature, ever--was taken up by the Disney people and made into such a spectacle. I am disappointed in both Walden Media and Ms. Patterson's decision to sell it. This book was written to make sense of a grievous event. The film was made to make money, and I am sorry for those who will miss the book for the film which is nothing short of noisy, loud, and garish in its execution.",Bridge to Terabithia
562,samusarmada,"Beautiful and moving, a tale of friendship and imagination that will appeal more to adults than to children and will surely remind them of what they once had.",8,16 November 2008,"Much like the main characters it presents Bridge to Terabithia is caught in the middle of being both a children's and an adult's film. It delves into the areas of fantasy, hope and friendship all against the backdrop of loneliness, under appreciation and worry. Like all good films it combines the two to produce a sweet, endearing and at times heart breaking film.The film gently introduces its main characters to us, establishing family set ups and main characters positioning throughout their school system. Unsurprisingly main character Jess Adams is a bit of a misfit, his farmyard upbringing the brunt of the bullying he faces at school. Once this is established we meet Leslie Burke, the likewise equally misunderstood female character who plays the role of the slightly kooky, imaginative girl. Like all childhood friendships their relationship develops quickly, a slight sense of tension at the start is quickly forgone thanks to some tried and tested chewing gun and a race to a tree. It's both a charming and an idyllic relationship, hints of romantic interest remain appropriately as hints-never going too far but amicably showing affection and the ever popular method of having two friends have a quarrel and then make up later in the movie is thankfully avoided. The actors themselves are strong as well. I was never really a fan of Josh Hutcherson (who plays Jess) mainly because I didn't like Zathura, but here he gives a strong performance, particularly from someone his age. Likewise AnnaSophia Robb (Leslie) is also strong. Her more positive and inquisitive character is easier to pull off than Josh's (who, it has to be said has to go through varying emotional stages) but she does do her job very well and most importantly the chemistry between the too leads is there is full force. This is perhaps the area where Bridge to Terabithia will mostly appeal to adults. Children will find the early parts tedious, anxiously waiting for Terabithia itself, but for adults the two characters relationship is one of endearing innocence. Such relationships can never happen with those past that mystical puberty ridden gateway so the sense of friendship and excitement is all the more powerful here.Something that well extends into Terabithia itself. The two create this dreamland out of their own forest as a means of escaping the bullies and school that populate their real lives. Its meaning is not merely so superfluous however; this is a world where both can foster their own gifts of imagination and creativity. Terabithia turns out not to be a means of escape but a means of creation. It is a world that adults really have no business entering or have any means of even attempting to enter. As someone who long ago crossed the bitter border that separates childhood from teenage angst I felt slightly incredulous about how they could imagine such a world based on real features; but that was the thing that really got to me about Bride to Terabithia, it's a film that I can no longer fully connect with because it is an idea that has mournfully now left me. Ultimately this made the film connect to me on a different level and one that truly had a far greater impact. It reminded me of how wonderful and escapist being a child can be. How turning ordinary events into extraordinary creations was not only the norm but also brilliantly fascinating. Again, thankfully the film keeps this sense of imagination alive; whereas in most films the parental figure at some points tells the child to grow up and live in the real world here such a feeling are never presented. Though the family are financially struggling and although the Dad still asks for Jess to help out more the intrusion of family life into this world is never pressed. What really takes Bridge to Terabithia to the next level is how the opposite occurs. The real world does not take its toll on Terabithia, Terabithia makes its mark on the real world and it is at this point that the true reasoning behind growing up, the true understanding of knowing the limitation to such fantasies make their most tragic mark.Bridge to Terabithia is a film that deals with the realities of life in ways we perhaps would not want it to deal with. Films often deal with growing up when faced with adversity, but rarely do films show this sense of childhood-this innocence in the imaginative sense. It has its share of niggles-the script is aimed and necessarily written for younger people and at times you will see the characters do things you would rather they didn't. But this is because you can see so much of yourself here in this film that it resonates with you to the point at which the somewhat repetitive dialogue (""wow"" ""Jess over here"" ""wow"") becomes not only understandable but also familiar. In the end this is a film that has made me wonder why I ever even wanted to grow up in the first place but more importantly it made me look up at the trees and wonder just what could really be lurking there... a valt, a gredarg, or even a chelit perhaps? You have no idea what these are because I made these creatures up after watching Bridge to Terabithia. The film gave this particular reviewer part of his imagination back, and for that he is eternally grateful.",Bridge to Terabithia
563,caitlin-58,Beautifully amazing! Better than the book...,9,16 February 2007,"Bridge to Terabithia is a story about a kid named Jesse Aarons who loves to draw. When a new girl who is a little odd moves in, named Leslie Burke, these two kids spark up a unique friendship. Together, they create a magical world in a wood that they call Terabithia, where they battle imaginary creatures and find a way to deal with the bullies at their school.Even though the trailer of this movie depicts it as a fantasy like Chronicles of Narnia, it is completely different. The animation takes up very little of this movie. I was happy to see that, because I was worried they were going to ruin a potentially good story, but they did the movie almost perfectly. It was very faithful to the book.The casting was really good in this movie. Josh Hutcherson and AnnaSophia Robb were perfect together, and they both are very good actors. Jess's parents were really good in their roles, and so was Jess's teacher. The writing was done well in this movie. It stuck with the plot of the book and included elements not in the book that enhanced the meaning of the story. It also emphasized the message at the end of the movie which I wish the book had done more. I liked, too, how they slightly updated it, making it a modern story so kids these days could relate to it more.The only complaint I had with this movie was the animation. Even though it didn't take up very much of the movie, I wish they had made it a little more subtle. The animation wasn't very good, and the creatures they created for it were really weird.Overall, this is a must-see film. The storyline is great, the casting is wonderful, and it is very powerful. If you liked the book, you'll love the movie.",Bridge to Terabithia
