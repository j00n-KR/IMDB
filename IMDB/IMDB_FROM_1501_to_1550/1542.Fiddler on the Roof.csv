0,TheLittleSongbird,Absolutely wonderful!,10,23 January 2010,"I know people have complained about the length of this movie. Yeah, it is long, three hours approximately, but there are so many things that compensate. Norman Jewison's direction is very good, and the film is stylishly filmed, with some nice cinematography and there are nice scenery and costumes. The choreography is great, energetic in parts and graceful in others. Next, the music is outstanding. The incidental music largely reminiscent of Russian folk music is a real treat, but the songs are outstanding. The beautiful ""Sunrise, Sunset"", the fun ""Tradition"", the idealistic ""Match Maker"" and the energetic ""If I Were A Rich Man"", all amazing. Also, Topol, what an absolutely brilliant performance. He put body and soul into Tevye, successfully mixing humour, wisdom and poignancy and the result is one of the most memorable performances in any musical to grace our screens. All the other performances are wonderful, I liked it all five daughters had distinct personalities, and Norma Crane is fantastic as the mother. The story is both tight and poignant, about a milkman of Jewish values, who wishes his five daughters to marry. In conclusion, wonderful and definitely memorable. 10/10 Bethany Cox",Fiddler on the Roof
1,Leofwine_draca,Heavygoing,5,17 February 2014,"A popular film adaptation of the stage musical, although I think this has more to do with the fact that Jews run Hollywood than its quality as a movie. For FIDDLER ON THE ROOF is a long, slow and extremely heavy-going movie, for which the lengthiness of its story is never offset by the quality of the music.Topol - the only actor in the film to give a notable performance - gives a solid performance as a poor Jewish man struggling to bring up five daughters in 19th century Russia. The various sub-plots that follow involve him pairing off his daughters with varying suitors (along the lines of PRIDE & PREJUDICE) while a growing pogrom against the Jews is developing in the background.Some of the songs are very good, particularly ""Tradition"" and ""If I Were a Rich Man"", but in between these are simply lots of long, drawn out sequences of nothing much happening. In fact, despite the extreme length, I found this to be a fairly empty film, without a great deal of depth or, indeed, substance; everything you see is on the surface, and that's it. This is why I didn't like it very much and it's certainly not a film I can envisage sitting through again when there are so many better, more vibrant musicals out there.",Fiddler on the Roof
2,SnoopyStyle,Slow at first but very compelling story,8,3 October 2013,"The Jewish community in the village of Anatevka live simple lives in Tzarist Russia. Norman Jewison directed this 3 hour grand movie adapted from the stage. Reb Tevye (Topol) is a poor milkman with five daughters. This movie is partly about the struggle between traditional life and the new ideas of marrying for love. All of this struggle takes place with the backdrop of racism and cruelty of Tzarist Russia.This movie does move slowly in the first half concentrating mostly on the daughters' relationships. They struggle against the traditional ideals. Around the midway, the wedding provide a change in tone as the struggle comes to a head, and the outside world tramples in on their world.The 3 hour running time could be tough for some people. They may have trouble with the first hour. There are some great songs in that section. It's a compelling story that's worth the watch.",Fiddler on the Roof
3,Hitchcoc,The Songs Make It Happen,9,29 September 2006,"Opening with the wonderful song ""Tradition"" which is the overriding theme of the entire musical, with its comedy and its pain, this film is a charming, sentimental telling of the lives and tribulations of a family. The beauty of it is that despite occasional violence against a people, they maintain their spirit through the ages. It's about what every father believes, ""There is no one adequate to marry my daughter."" Things happen and people get knocked down, and eventually everyone gets to his feet once more. There is the combative relationship between Tevye and his wife, and their love (""but do you love me"") that goes pretty much unstated. In the end they continue to stand tall together because what they have put into the world is true love, not the overly dramatic, silly love that permeates our world today. See the movie. See the stage play. You will always leave with an optimistic spring in your step, and wonderful songs in your heart.",Fiddler on the Roof
4,mark.waltz,You'll be a richer man for having seen this.,10,18 January 2014,"Anti-Semitism has been an issue of the world for millenniums, and as one character here describes the life of a Jew, ""Our fore-fathers have been kicked out of many places."" ""Maybe that's why we always wear our hats"", Topol's Tevye gently replies, a touch of irony hidden behind his wisecrack. Tevye is a poor man, but he is a man of the world who understands humanity, both Jewish and Gentile, and he has no issue of socializing on occasion with the Gentile Russians he is surrounded by. He longs to help keep the peace, and for good reason: He has eight daughters who must find good husbands, and a tough wife who keeps him in line. It's all about ""Tradition!"", though, and Tevye is having a difficult time in accepting the changing times, especially the independence his three oldest daughters throw his way as his ideals of traditional matchmaking are thrown out of the window.Wife Golde (Norma Crane) surprises him with the news that Yente the Matchmaker (Molly Picon) has come up with a match for their oldest daughter, Tzeitel. It's Lazar Wolfe, the widowed butcher, a man Tevye despises, but after downing a few shots thanks to the rich Lazar, Tevye is convinced that he'll be perfect for the namesake of Golde's beloved grandmother. What he doesn't count on is the fact that Tzeitel and the two daughters next in line all have their own ideas as to what makes a perfect match, and after the rousing ""To Life!"", Tevye learns the truth when he breaks the news to the love-lorn Tzeitel. Leonard Frey, who had a small role in the original Broadway production, takes over the role of the tailor Motel Kamzoil and sings the beautiful love song ""Miracle of Miracles"", showing a lot of heart and life in this presumably straight-laced young man.From there, the two other daughters show their own rebellion, and Tevye's frustration grows. Topol is outstanding as Tevye's traditions are threatened but he finds conflict in his own heart because of his great love for his daughters. He must then confront his own past with Golde, an arranged marriage which introduced them on their own wedding day. While Golde is a bit hard on the surface, you know she is filled with love, at first obvious for her daughters, and even more begrudgingly later for the husband she was seemingly forced to spend the rest of her life dedicated to serving him. ""Barking at the servants day and night!"", Tevye sings in the show-stopping ""If I Were a Rich Man"", describing his seemingly harpy wife who has more dimensions than meets the eye.Molly Picon is adorable as Yente the Matchmaker, and as in everything she ever did on screen, she makes you just want to hug her, even if she is a bit of an unromantic in the way she manipulates every young person's love life. The shot of her at a wedding during the profound ""Sunrise, Sunset"" is truly revealing as she too can't deny the power of young love, even if it potentially means the end of her life-long profession. Then, there's ""Tevye's Dream"", the fantasy sequence where Tevye must convince Golde that Lazar Wolfe is not the right match for their daughter. Extremely lavish and slightly camp (especially with the vision of Lazar's late wife Fruma Sarah), it is both a comical and scary nightmare, like something out of a British Hammer horror film.The long Broadway run featured many Tevye's (most famously the original, Zero Mostel), and Topol, who headlined the British production, is outstanding in every sense. It has been revived many times on Broadway, most recently as 2003 (for a two-year run), and will soon celebrate its 50th Anniversary. The wonderfully sentimental and witty lyrics of Sheldon Harnick (still around as of this writing at the spry age of 90!) and the gorgeous score by Jerry Bock surround a brilliant book, and the production values on this movie are simply breathtaking. Director Norman Jewison and his crew provide many details into the traditions of the Russian Jews of this era that are simple for us Gentiles to catch onto, and you may find yourself engulfed in the culture of these passionate people who would find even more serious struggles in the decades to come. Books on this history of this show and movie give more detail as to the meanings of certain words and phrases, and open the eyes of us who want to reach beyond our own lives and embrace the different cultures of the world. To Life, indeed!",Fiddler on the Roof
5,claudio_carvalho,Jewish Tradition and the New World,10,25 December 2011,"In the beginning of the Twentieth Century, Jews and Orthodox Christians live in the little village of Anatevka in the pre-revolutionary Russia of the Czars. Among the traditions of the Jewish community, the matchmaker arranges the match and the father approves it. The milkman Reb Tevye (Topol)is a poor man that has been married for twenty-five years with Golde (Norma Crane) and they have five daughters. When the local matchmaker Yente (Molly Picon) arranges the match between his older daughter Tzeitel (Rosalind Harris) and the old widow butcher Lazar Wolf (Paul Mann), Tevye agrees with the wedding. However Tzeitel is in love with the poor tailor Motel Kazoil (Leonard Frey) and they ask permission to Tevye to get married that accepts to please his daughter. Then his second daughter Hodel (Michele Marsh) and the revolutionary student Perchik (Michael Glaser) decide to marry each other and Tevye is forced to accept. When Perchik is arrested by the Czar troops and sent to Siberia, Hodel decides to leave her family and homeland and travel to Siberia to be with her beloved Perchik.When his third daughter Chaveleh (Neva Small) decides to get married with the Christian Fyedka (Raymond Lovelock), Tevye does not accept and considers that Chava has died. Meanwhile the Czar troops evict the Jewish community from Anatevka.""Fiedler on the Roof"" is a wonderful musical for the whole family about Jewish tradition and the new world. The performances are top-notch and this film has been nominated and won several awards, including Best Cinematography, Best Music Scoring Adaptation and Original Song Score and Best Sound. The songs are magnificent and my favorite is ""Sunrise Sunset"" (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLLEBAQLZ3Q). The sequence when Tevye asks Golde whether she loves him or not is delightful. Despite the 181 minutes running time with Intermission, the viewer does not fell the time passing by in this marvelous film. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): ""Um Violinista no Telhado"" (""A Fiedler on the Roof"")",Fiddler on the Roof
6,classicsoncall,"""To life!""",8,5 July 2019,"No doubt a must see movie by all accounts, but oddly, I didn't care for it all that much. Virtually all aspects of the film are commendable, and while the story occurs in a different time and place, I found it hard to relate to such concepts as love being a radical idea, arranged marriages, and oh my! - a woman dancing with a man! With his rigid ideology and faith based lifestyle, Tevye (Topol) was the kind of person who would have been out of place in the Twentieth First Century, perhaps even in the fictional Russian village of Anatevka. The only character I could really relate to here was Paul Michael Glaser's Perchik, who wouldn't accept the world the way it was, and spent his time either teaching patiently, or railing against the status quo. Fortunately, many of the film's songs are quite well known in the popular culture, and provide entertaining interludes between the trials and tribulations of Tevye's household and the village's threat from the Czarist regime intent on relocating it. I don't want my tepid review here to dissuade anyone from watching the movie because it is quite well done with excellent cinematography and a talented cast of players. I even evaluate it as I would a picture I really liked, with my only reservations based on personal preference. Contrarian as I am, I'd say go ahead and see it.",Fiddler on the Roof
7,gavin6942,One of the All-Time Great Musicals,8,19 September 2012,"In pre-revolutionary Russia, a poor Jewish peasant (Topol) must contend with marrying off his three daughters while antisemitic sentiment threatens his home.Let me say this right of the bat: while this film may focus on a Jewish family and their struggle to enter the modern world (which may be good or bad), you certainly do not need to be Jewish to enjoy it. I always felt like this film (and ""Yentl"") were marketed towards the Jewish community, but it need not be. It is just a great story with excellent songs.I loved the singing, the dancing, the story, the humor, the characters... there was really nothing I disliked about it. I was a bit surprised the eldest daughter was not Barbra Streisand, because they look identical. But, oh well. And I am also a bit surprised that the director was not Jewish, especially with a name like Jewison... but hey, he did a marvelous job!",Fiddler on the Roof
8,lee_eisenberg,"tradition dies, life goes on",10,20 June 2011,"Norman Jewison's adaptation of Jerry Bock's musical masterfully tells the story of poor Jewish milkman Tevye (Chaim Topol) having to deal with the dying out of traditions, as well as anti-Semitism in tsarist Russia. The obvious metaphor is the title character representing the situation of the Jews in Eastern Europe in the early 20th century, but the movie also seems to be alluding to the generation gap. Much like how young people across the world had little in common with the parents generation by 1971, Tevye's daughters want to find husbands on their own, rather than have a matchmaker do it.I once saw a stage production of ""Fiddler on the Roof"", and the movie equals it very well. Overall, the movie shows two things. The first is that musicals like ""FotR"" and ""West Side Story"" are easily the best of their genre, tackling less-than-pleasant issues (WSS dealt with racial tension). But also, it affirms that Jewison had made the biggest possible jump from his debut (""Forty Pounds of Trouble"", which I've never seen but heard was vomit-inducingly atrocious). ""Fiddler..."", along with ""The Russians are Coming, the Russians are Coming"", ""In the Heat of the Night"", ""Rollerball"", ""Other People's Money"" and ""The Hurricane"" show him to be one of the greatest directors of all time.All in all, not only do I recommend this movie to everyone, but I would say that 1971 was possibly the best ever year for cinema: ""Little Murders"", ""McCabe and Mrs. Miller"", ""Bananas"", ""Carnal Knowledge"", ""Shaft"", ""Willard"", ""The French Connection"", ""The Last Picture Show"" and ""A Clockwork Orange"".",Fiddler on the Roof
9,jboothmillard,Fiddler on the Roof,8,14 July 2005,"I am always on the lookout for good films with a good actor, or a good musical, and this has both. This is telling the story of a man and his family. Golden Globe winning, and Oscar nominated Topol plays Tevrre, the father who is quite a strict man. All his children are getting married to men who are not that rich, and his wife is very happy for them. He is happy too, but he wants to make sure the weddings are perfect and they get some money. Topol, I have seen in Flash Gordon and For Your Eyes Only, is a great star for this very good musical. The best song, from him, is ""If I Were a Rich Man"". It does not show The Fiddler on the Roof that much, but that's not important. The ending is a bit sad as well, but it is still a classic. It won the Oscars for Best Cinematography, Best Music for John Williams and Best Sound, and it was nominated for Best Supporting Actor for Leonard Frey as Motel Kamzoil, Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Director for Norman Jewison (Moonstruck) and Best Picture, it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Cinematography, Best Film Editing and Best Sound Track, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Musical/Comedy, and it was nominated for Best Director and Best Supporting Actor for Paul Mann as Lazar Wolf. It was number 82 on 100 Years, 100 Cheers, and it was number 33 on The 100 Greatest Musicals. Very good!",Fiddler on the Roof
10,ccthemovieman-1,Too Long & Generally Overrated,3,8 January 2007,"This disappointed me mainly because it looked so promising in the beginning. At first this appeared to be an enormously-entertaining story and solid religious one with the main character talking to God all the time.However, after 90 minutes of viewing this, I wondered if only God could sustain enough interest to keep going. Man, it was b-o-r-i-n-g!Since I like Israeli songs with all the violin music - and the title infers that, too - I hoped to at least hear a lot of that. Wrong again. Most of songs didn't feature that and they weren't anything to write home about. When they did have some dance tunes that were lively, they - like the movie - went on forever. To be fair some of the songs were good and a few of them became famous, thanks to this stage play-turned-movie, but not enough of them to suit me.Another thing that turned me off was the typical '60s-70s youth culture propaganda in which the message here was that the old traditions and the people who believed in them are shown to be of little value while the younger man with his new views is shown to be ""enlightened."" This is such typical Liberal baloney. However, it was nice to see a made-for- adults early '70s movie that was not sleazy. Hallelujah! If they had cut this from three to two hours, it might have been a lot more watchable. This is way too long and way too overrated.",Fiddler on the Roof
11,moonspinner55,"""One season following another/Laden with happiness and tears...""",7,9 November 2009,"Russian Jews in a small Ukrainian farming village in the early 1900s are unaware of the political tensions brewing in the city...and how the new Czarist regime will eventually sweep all of them up into an exodus of change. Popular musical entertainment via Broadway, with heartfelt characters and a universal theme--Old World tradition versus the new ideals--resulting in a production which is alternately robust and bittersweet. The confines of the material (as conceptualized on the stage, where this show ran for nearly eight years) occasionally burdens the narrative, though director Norman Jewison keeps a pretty lively pace. The editing is weak and does the filmmaker no favors, and the camera never seems to be in the right place, however most of the performers are intensely in-tune with this story and bring out the jubilant soul of the piece. Topol stars as simple milkman Tevye, watching as three of his five daughters drift away into the arms of romantic suitors; he consults with God on matters of money and the heart, weighing each circumstance with even reasoning, and compares the attempt at living a common yet balanced life to that of a fiddler on a rooftop. The film would hardly be much more than an old-fashioned, sentimental exercise were it not for Topol, who sings and dances and jiggles across the screen like a circus bear. In Topol, Jewison has found an appropriate way to capture this theatrical happening on film--and actually make it mean something. Several sequences feel lumpen, and too often there's no exaltation at the climax of the musical numbers, but it still works a fiery-eyed kind of magic. *** from ****",Fiddler on the Roof
12,wes-connors,That Touch of Shmutz,7,29 October 2011,"In Tsarist Russia, a Jewish milkman steeped in tradition faces a rebellion in both his daughters' marriage choices and world politics. ""Fiddler on the Roof"" is a great musical filmed as an endurance test. Going for a lower performance key, they replaced original star Zero Mostel with Topol (as Tevye). The latter won praise from voters giving out ""Academy Awards"" (a nomination), ""Golden Globes"" (an award) and even the ""New York Film Critics"" (eighth place). Nothing against all of this, but once Topol raises his hands on the dirt road and steps around in a circle, Mr. Mostel is missed. Lacking Mostel's movement and phrasing, the song ""If I Were a Rich Man"" is a noticeably lesser highlight. So much for tradition...Also didn't care for the grainy cinematography, village women's wigs, frightening dream wedding, and battle scene. And, film adaptations of theatrical plays should usually run shorter than their counterparts. Still, Topol and the cast do their best to fill the originals' shoes in the manner stipulated by Norman Jewison. Matchmaker Molly Picon's ""Yente"" is one-note, but what a note; why didn't she receive a ""Best Supporting Actress"" nomination? The suitors - tailor Leonard Frey (as Motel), student Paul Michael Glaser (as Perchik), and gentile Raymond Lovelock (as Fyedka) - are perfect. Much of the soundtrack, composed by Jerry Bock and Sheldon Harnick, is thrilling - especially the magnificent ""Sunrise, Sunset"".******* Fiddler on the Roof (10/21/71) Norman Jewison ~ Topol, Leonard Frey, Molly Picon, Paul Michael Glaser",Fiddler on the Roof

Well-done with good acting (especially Topol) and some good songs and incredible dances...but at 3 hours it's way too long.  Some of the songs are real duds and should have been cut and some of the dances go on forever.  From what I've heard, this was never a big hit--in fact it was reissued in 1981 cut by 30 minutes!

14,CinemaSerf,A tour de force from actors and lyricist alike...,7,28 April 2020,"Topol (""Tevye"") is superb in this telling of a tale of an agrarian Jewish father in late 19th century Russia who has three daughters. The basic premiss is that he has to arrange suitable ""matches"" for them. With the aid of some classic numbers like ""Matchmaker"" & ""If I was I Rich Man"" we share his experiences and adventures as he attempts, with varying degrees of success, to find suitable husbands for his girls. Set against a backdrop of religious intolerance, and ultimately a pogrom, this is a clever, engaging depiction of the harsh conditions endured by rural Russians in general and the Jewish community specifically. Norman Jewison contrives to reconcile sometimes quite brutal stories of religious prejudice with a defiantly gentle, joyful communal spirit in a thought-provoking and personable fashion. Jerry Bock's instantly recognisable score - based around a delicate, witty and entertaining lyric from Sheldon Harnick makes this as good as any of the genre and although it does drag a bit at the start of the second act, it passes the three hour mark with considerable style.",Fiddler on the Roof
15,writers_reign,Goys And Dills,7,6 May 2012,"This is a fine adaptation of a successful Broadway musical. Several better Broadway musicals - Guys And Dolls, Can Can - have come off worse on celluloid but this one succeeds admirably, possibly because as the many productions/revivals have demonstrated, the leading role of Teyve is so well constructed that virtually any competent actor can take it on. Whilst several 'serious' themes - oppression, racism, tradition in a changing world - are tackled the 'entertainment' element is always present, sugaring the pill of propaganda. The score also provides a fine balance of songs that delineate character, move the story along and wouldn't work as 'stand-alone' songs, with the traditional (sorry about that) 'Broadway' element (If I Were A Rich Man, Matchmaker, Matchmaker, Sunrise, Sunset). On the whole a satisfying late addition to the Hollywood musical canon.",Fiddler on the Roof
16,zardoz-13,One of the Greatest Musicals of All Time!,10,15 October 2009,"When United Artists hired the Toronto native Norman Jewison, they thought that he was Jewish. When Jewison met with the producers for the first time, he informed them: ""You know I'm not Jewish . . . right?""""Fiddler on the Roof"" qualified as the first commercially successful English-language play about Jewish life in Eastern Europe. The story takes place is in Tsarist Russia in 1905 in the Ukrainian village of Anatevka. Tony Awarding-winning playwright Joseph Stein wrote the Broadway musical as well as the screenplay, and Stein drew his material from the story ""Tevye and his Daughters"" (or Tevye the Milkman) and other tales by Sholem Aleichem. Aleichem has the distinction of being the first to write children's literature in Yiddish. The story focuses on Tevye, a poor dairyman with five daughters, and his tireless efforts to preserve his family and religious traditions against a changing world. Tevye must deal with not only the strong-minded exploits of his three older daughters—Tzeitel, Hodel, and Chava--each embraces a husband who represent a departure farther away from the customs of her faith—but also with the Tsar's edict that evicts the Jews from their village.The poster for the Jewison movie comes from Russian artist Marc Chagall's painting entitled 'The Dead Man' and it depicts a wily violinist perched atop a roof during a funeral. Tevye (Topol) uses the 'fiddler on the roof' metaphor for his efforts to survive in a rapidly changing world. Tevye refers to the instability that ignoring traditions would create when he observes ""Our lives would be as shaky as a fiddler on the roof."" United Artists hired Israeli actor Chaim Topol to play Tevye, partly because he had originated The film was eventually shot on location in rural Yugoslavia in what is now called Croatia.""Fiddler"" relates its story through narration addressed to the audience. The protagonist Tevye (Topol) breaks the fourth wall and talks to the audience. He explains that the equanimity that the Jews of Anatevka have acquired from obedience to their ancient traditions is what keeps them going. We know that Tevye is a religious man because he speaks to God regularly. According to Tevye, the welfare of the Jews is as precarious as a 'fiddler on the roof.' In other words, it is no picnic playing a winsome tune while no breaking their backs with work. This figure steps in and out of the action over the course of the three hours to remind us about the eternal obstacles that confront the Jews. Despite the vast differences of time and setting, ""Fiddler on the Roof"" qualifies as a Jewish version of ""Gone with the Wind."" Change assails the characters here as they do the families in the antebellum South in Margret Mitchell's masterpiece. Like the ""Gone with the Wind's"" Rhett Butler, Tevye discovers new inner strength in spite of the toll that these overwhelming changes exact on his life.Initially, Tevye arranges for his oldest daughter, Tzeitel (Rosalind Harris of ""The Cotton Club""), through the village matchmaker Yente (Molly Picon of ""Come Blow Your Horn"") to wed wealthy butcher Lazar Wolf (Paul Mann), who is considerably older than Tzeitel. Instead, Tzeitel has fallen in love with her childhood friend, Motel (Leonard Frey of ""Finnegan's Wake""), who is a lowly tailor. Motel pleads with Tevye not to marry his daughter off to an older man. Tevye hatches a crazy scheme to rescind his original plans for Tzeitel. He tells Golde (Norma Crane of ""Tea and Sympathy"") that he has had a nightmare. In the nightmare, Golde's dead grandmother advised him that Tzeitel ought to become Motel's wife as Heaven has decreed. Tevye reveals that Lazar Wolf's dead wife Fruma-Sarah has warned him that should Tzeitel marry Lazar, Fruma-Sarah will make sure that Tzeitel dies three weeks after marriage. This nightmare scene is about as surreal as ""Fiddler on the Roof"" gets with Tevye and Golde in their big bed in the middle of a graveyard while zombified relatives warble tunes. Predictably, Lazar Wolf is happy with this reversal of fate. Meanwhile, the specter of anti-Semitism rears its ugly head in the same scene that introduces us to Perchik (Paul Michael Glaser of TV's ""Starsky & Hutch"") as he meets Tevye near the town square. The Jews are discussing a recent edict that forced Jews to abandon their homes in a distant town. Essentially, Perchik is a young Marxist, anti-monarch student from the university with noble ideals. He argues that the rich prey on the poor. Tevye hires him to tutor his daughters and he pays Perchik off with food. Later, Model and Tzeitel are married. Tevye later learns that Hodel and Perchik have pledged themselves to each other. Shocked, Tevye gives them not only his blessing but also his permission. Tevye is quite so liberal when he disowns his third daughter, Chava (Neva Small of ""The Laser Man""), for marrying a young Russian Gentile, Fyedka (Ray Lovelock of ""The Cassandra Crossing"") outside of her faith. ""Fiddler on the Roof"" illustrates the tenacity of the human spirit as the Jews, particularly Tevye contend with the ever-changing world. Several ""Fiddler"" songs have become classics, such as ""Matchmaker, Matchmaker,"" ""Miracle of Miracles,"" ""If I Were a Rich Man,"" ""Sunrise, Sunset,"" and ""Do You Love Me."" Jewison summarized ""Fiddler on the Roof"" as ""the story of a man and his God, and his problems with his five daughters.""",Fiddler on the Roof

18,evanston_dad,"Strong Material, Beautiful Score and Wonderful Lead Performance Overcome Heavy Directorial Hand",7,9 April 2007,"Director Norman Jewison does all he can to pound the life right out of this screen adaptation of the phenomenally successful Broadway musical, but thanks to the strength of the original material, he doesn't succeed.There are many better screen musicals, but there are also many that are far worse. Suffice it to say that Hollywood, which had churned out one disastrous musical after another for the last decade, finally got back to producing a musical it could be proud of. This beautiful story about a simple milkman in turn-of-the-century Russia who must come to terms with the loss of the safe and only world he has ever known, succeeds on screen largely due to the performance of Topol, who breathes body and soul into Tevye the milkman and creates one of those characters that for ever after you instantly associate with the actor who played him. You can feel him working overtime to keep Jewison's lumbering physical production on its feet, and his efforts prove themselves to be nearly Herculean, since Jewison can't direct a musical number to save his life. ""Fiddler on the Roof"" is not a dance musical, but it does have some rousing dance numbers courtesy of Jerome Robbins; however, you wouldn't know it from this movie, since Jewison almost unfailingly chooses the worst camera angle from which to shoot every single frame of the musical portions.What the movie does boast, however, is a glorious version of the musical's beautiful score, left nearly intact and memorably orchestrated by John Williams. It soars and leaps even when the production it's anchored to just sits like a lump.Grade: A-",Fiddler on the Roof
19,JamesHitchcock,The Hallmark of All Great Art,10,8 July 2016,"To celebrate my 1600th review for this site I turn to another of my favourite films. Like a number of other cinematic genres, such as the war film and the Western, the traditional Hollywood musical was to go into something of a decline in the late seventies, but the early part of the decade had seen two very fine examples, ""Fiddler on the Roof"" and ""Cabaret"". ""Fiddler"" is set in the Russian village of Anatevka in 1905. Actually, Anatevka is really two villages, one Jewish and one Christian, and there is little interaction between the two. Nearly all the main characters are drawn from the Jewish community.It amazes me that anti-Semites have sometimes attempted to brand Jews ""rootless cosmopolitans"", as Jewish communities have always struck me as very conscious of their roots, their traditions and identity. The film, like the Broadway musical on which it is based, can be seen as an exploration of the role of tradition in Jewish life. In the opening song, actually entitled ""Tradition"", the main character Tevye explains the importance of tradition to him and his neighbours. Several Jewish traditions, including a wedding and a Sabbath meal, are reproduced in the film.The film, however, also shows how the traditions which Tevye holds so dear are being challenged from within and threatened from without. Within Anatevka and the wider Jewish community the younger generation are starting to question the values which their parents have lived by. The threat from outside comes from state-sponsored anti-Semitism in the form of the pogroms. The film's title comes from a line of Tevye's; he compares the predicament of Russian Jews to that of a fiddler on the roof, desperately trying to keep his footing and to play a merry tune while in a precarious situation. Tevye intends this as a metaphor, but an actual fiddler appears in the film at various points.The story is a simple one. Tevye, a poor village milkman, and his wife Golde have five daughters but no sons. The three elder girls are all of marriageable age (the younger two are just children), and all three find husbands who, in one way or another, represent a breach with tradition. Tzeitel, the eldest, would rather marry her childhood sweetheart Motel, a poor tailor, rather than the wealthy but elderly widower found for her by the village matchmaker. Hodel, the second daughter, falls in love with Perchik, a politically radical student, and stands by him even when he is exiled to Siberia for his part in a demonstration. And the third daughter, Chava, wants to marry a Gentile. (Motel and Perchik are both Jewish). Marrying outside the faith is a step too far for Tevye, even though his love for his family has led him to give his blessing to Tzeitel and (rather reluctantly) to Hodel. He refuses Chava his permission to marry, and disowns her when she defies him by marrying her beloved in a Christian ceremony.There are a number of reasons why I have long regarded this as one of the greatest, perhaps the greatest, of all screen musicals. The first is that the songs (music by Jerry Bock, lyrics by Sheldon Harnick) are very fine ones. They range from the rousing (""Tradition"", ""To Life!"") to the deeply moving (""Sunrise, Sunset"", ""Far from the Home I Love"") to the humorous (""Matchmaker, Matchmaker""), although the humour is sometimes rather dark. The song ""If I Were a Rich Man"", for example, contains some humorous descriptions of Tevye's imagined life if he were to become rich, yet is also a complaint addressed to the heavens against his poverty.The second reason why I love this film is the performance of Topol in the central role. Tevye is the dominant figure in the film, not only its main character but also its narrator, addressing the audience directly. Topol, only 36 at the time, was considerably younger than the part he was playing; Tevye, the father of three adult daughters, is probably supposed to be at least ten years older. The makeup department do a good job in making him look older, but Topol nevertheless brings a younger man's energy and vitality to the part, making a Tevye powerful, larger- than-life figure. He also has a fine singing voice. There are too many good supporting performances to mention them all, but I must single out Norma Crane as Golde, Leonard Frey as the timid Motel and a pre-""Starsky and Hutch"" Paul Michael Glaser (here billed simply as ""Michael"") as the idealistic Perchik.My final reason for loving the film is the direction of Norman Jewison. (According to one story, he was only given the job because he was wrongly thought to be Jewish because of his surname). The original Broadway production was dominated by bright colours, inspired by the art of Marc Chagall, but the look of the film is much more realistic; the only time it veers into fantasy is during Tevye's dream sequence. (Location shooting actually took place in Yugoslavia, about the only part of Eastern Europe where American film crews would have been welcome in 1971). I think that this was the right decision; what works well on stage is not always the right choice in a film. Jewison's sombre photography helps to anchor the film in a particular place and time but also adds to its timeless appeal. The villagers of Anatevka are people we can identify with, who speak to us through the years about the problems of their own time and of ours. (Nobody can watch the film without being uncomfortably aware that in years to come the Jewish population of Eastern Europe were to suffer tribulations far worse than anything the Tsarist regime could devise). Jewison, Bock, Harnick and all those involved with the film invest it with the universality which is the hallmark of all great art. 10/10",Fiddler on the Roof
20,sddavis63,Tradition,9,3 January 2011,"This movie definitely packs a lot into it and it definitely packs a punch. Set apparently near the end of Czarist rule in Russia, it's the story of one Jewish family living in a small Russian village, and of their relationships with those around them. The story is basically told through the eyes of Tevye, the patriarch of the family, who was brilliantly portrayed by an actor named Topol.Opening with a wonderful song about tradition, that becomes the overwhelming theme of the movie - the role of tradition in the community - and perhaps, as the ending of the movie seems to make clear - the most uncompromising tradition is that nothing stays the same. We see this battle over tradition largely through the eyes of Tevye's three eldest daughters. The oldest of them was arranged without her knowledge to be married to the local butcher - a much older man - but was already in love with someone else. Faced with his daughter's refusal, Tevye gives in and allows her to marry the man she loves. The second daughter then falls in love with a revolutionary who has been staying with the family in exchange for teaching the daughters - a match her father disapproves of (partly because the groom is on his way to St. Petersburg to be part of the coming revolution) but then again gives in on. Then tradition is challenges once more, as the third daughter falls in love with a local Russian official - and a Christian. Tevye refuses to give in on this point, but the two marry anyway and are cut off from the rest of the family. Arranged marriages and the role of the ""matchmaker"" are thus dealt with, and the role of the faith in the lives of the Jewish people of the community is humorously reflected upon throughout. The localized idiosyncratic traditions of such a small community are also delightfully brought out. The story also doesn't shy away from anti-semitism, shown in scattered scenes throughout, and then the cause of the major disruption in the end as the community scatters widely (from Jerusalem to Chicago to New York, etc.) because of an anti-Jewish pogrom that drives them away. In the history of Judaism, though - a people often scattered; driven from one place to another - such an occurrence also seems to have the feel of tradition, and it results in a bit of a reconciliation between the family and their third daughter.It's an exceptionally well constructed story. While the song and dance routines are all excellent, I might suggest that some of them went on just a bit too long, but that's one of the few criticisms I would make of a generally excellent story.",Fiddler on the Roof
21,theowinthrop,Without Tradition Our Lives Would Be As Shaky as a Fiddler On the Roof,10,14 October 2007,"Solomon/Sholom Rabinowitz was probably the greatest Eastern European Jewish writer (his closest competitor is Issac Peretz). In the late 19th Century, writing as ""Sholem Aleichem"", he wrote a huge amount of short stories, novels, and plays. When he supposedly met Mark Twain at the start of the 20th Century, Twain said he was told he was the American ""Sholem Aleichem"". Most people who know of him recall his invention of the character of the philosophical and wry witted dairyman Tevye. Tevye, in his village of Anatevka, is struggling to make a living and raise his seven (not five) daughters with his wife Golde. The short stories not only deal with his philosophical point of view of how God and man (in particular the Jews) coexist, but also how to get the girls married without the financial muscle to give them dowries that are expected.Joseph Stein's play for the Broadway musical this film is based on reduces the number of the daughters to five. Actually only the stories of the first three daughters Tzeitel (Rosalind Harris), Hodel (Michele Marsh), and Chava (Neva Small), are given in greater details - because the other two remaining daughters have stories that don't quite fit in with the film's conclusion. Shprinze (Elaine Edwards) drowns herself when jilted. Bielke (Candy Bonstein) does marry a millionaire war profiteer (the stories went up to the Russo - Japanese War), and Tevye has a brief period of prosperity (though he loathes the son-in-law as a bullying ignoramus) before the son-in-law's fortune collapses. In the movie the two girls end up heading for America with their parents.But Stein's play manages to get the spirit of Aleichem's stories across, so that the changes I mentioned are not too important. Tevye (Topol) can't understand why he is made to struggle daily and never get's a chance for some prosperity. ""You have made so many poor people."", Tevye says to God. ""I realize it is not a crime to be poor...but it's no great honor either!"" There is a chance for Tevye when the local butcher, Lazar Wolf (Paul Mann) reveals he wants to marry Tzeitel. Tevye agrees to the offer of Lazar through the marriage broker Yente (Molly Picon), much to the happiness of his wife Golde (Norma Crane). But Tevye learns that Tzeitel is in love with the village tailor Motel Kamzoil (Leonard Frey). How Tevye gets out of the marriage contract is straight from the original story - it shows how useful the supernatural can sometimes be.Subsequently Tevye faces the love affair of his second daughter Hodel with the young revolutionary Perchek (Paul Michael Glaser), who ends up getting sent to Siberia (whither Hodel follows him). And then comes the third daughter, Chava, who falls for Fyedka (Ray Lovelock), which ends in a peculiar tragedy for Tevye - Fyedka is Christian, and when they marry it is in a Russo Orthodox ceremony. Tevye's love for his faith and tradition - the backbone of Jewish existence that Tevye insists on - causes him to renounce his living third daughter as dead to the family.The collapsing days of the old Romanov Empire are illustrated, showing the use of official anti-Semitism as a manner of controlling the situation (it really didn't help much). As the viciousness of the old regime towards Jews ends the film with the forced removal of Tevye and his people from their lands. And the only thing to do is head for America or Poland or Israel - any place but Russia.The play/musical's numbers are well done, as are the violin solos played by Isaac Stern. Topol was a fine Tevye - although one misses seeing Zero Mostel's great performance there are some television sequences of Zero singing ""If I were a rich man"" that give us an idea of what he was like in the role. Topol emphasizes the even tempered, realist who is Tevye, who has a heart, sorely injured at times. He is abetted by his wife, a role well played by Crane. Molly Picon has a good time as that yente Yente, who is constantly trying to make a living making arranged marriages. Leonard Frey is fine as Motel, singing ""Wonder of Wonders"". Also note Louis Zorich as the local police constable, who has a ""decent"" relationship with Tevye, but who finds it collapse when ordered to force the Jews from the village (Topol puts him in his place quite well here). This film was a brilliant example of how to film a musical classic, and make a classic movie musical at the same time.",Fiddler on the Roof
22,ElMaruecan82,To Family ... To Tradition ... To Life ...,9,7 October 2011,"Seeking help from Springfield's synagogue to get a coronary bypass operation, Homer Simpson came to Rabbi Kruftosky and told him: ""Now I know I haven't been the best Jew, but I have rented ""Fiddler on the Roof"" and I will watch it ""' I'll complete this quote later but for now, I understand why ""Fiddler on the Roof"" is highly regarded in the Jewish community, for it provides the most enchanting and entertaining insights on Jewish traditions, 'Tradition' as the motto shouted by all the villagers of the small and peaceful town of Anatevka, in pre- revolutionary Russia, traditions like an immanent symbol of eternity. Sure, traditions and rituals are the tools that men use to construct a feeling of immortality, as a community, hence to overcome the fatality of death. But this is even truer for a community persecuted for centuries and that couldn't even afford an attachment to a land, so the only land Jews could never leave is the one that could never leave them. Hence the powerful symbolism of the title: letting the music speak for the soul of your community on a place that you might fall from. The title offers a poetic vision of a tragic historic reality, conveying the feeling that joy can anytime be followed by tragedy. So, if it can't be eternal, well at least traditions are.Still, the content of these traditions can appeal to every culture, especially oriental: patriarchy, life in community, hard work, social status, marriage, and of course, Family. And all these values are incarnated by a poor farmer and milkman with five daughters: Tevye, played by Topol with an electrifying mix of authority, charisma, magnetism, self-derision and some vulnerability betraying his penetrative eyes in the most dramatic moments. Topol is the friendly host of that epic journey, breaking the fourth wall to share his thoughts with us, and from the way he apostrophes God, who's like the film's second character, he powerfully embodies both the pride and the doom of being the 'chosen people'. Topol as Tevye is a larger-than-life character, carrying the film with such intensity that whenever he's absent, you feel like something is missing. In a way, he indirectly points out the small weaknesses of ""Fiddler on the Roof"".Despite their narrative significance, I didn't feel emotionally engaged by the growing romances through the story's recurring subplots, although I genuinely liked the first two husbands, Motel the tailor and Pershik, the revolutionary student (good old Starsky). But there was something too predictable in the way it was handled. You could tell the movie's point was about traditions being undermined by modernity. First, a marriage with a non-promised, then a non-religious man with Tevye giving his blessings and permissions despite a first negative reaction ... but the twist was on the third daughter marrying a gentile, too much asking for. This time, no blessing, no permission, no ""on the other hand"" reasoning, it was the kind of deathblow to tradition that would have made Grandma Tzeitel roll over in her grave. I wouldn't have minded the predictability, but when a movie, even a light-hearted musical, spans three epic hours, you got enough time to figure out everything, then the feeling introduced by the first act inevitably fades out, especially after the exhilarating ""Lechaim"" part. Besides, there wasn't much in these daughters that could really grab me, the part where they were singing was too Disney-like and the best love story in my eyes, was still between Tevye and his wife Golde (Norma Crane). But trusting Jewison's direction, I wondered why such a long film for a a plot that wouldn't present any twists, I guessed maybe it was a deliberate choice in order to 'distract' the viewer from the real dramatic aspect incarnated by the anti-Semitic threat, the persecutions and the pogroms from the Russian empire, 'distract' as a way to elevate ourselves from this inexplicable level of violence, and keep us in a good spirit, on the roof, listening to the sound of this violin, whose notes are getting more melodramatic.After the wedding sequence, the film takes a more serious course until the inevitable happens when people leave Anatevka for Palestine, Europe or America. Tevye invites the metaphoric fiddler on the roof to accompany him for the new exodus, as to reaffirm the obligatory attachment to tradition, with two fingers pointing at the sky. I felt the ending of the film was a downer but the more I thought of it, the more I realized it was a bittersweet ending. In a powerful moment after the infamous pogrom that ruined the wedding, Tevye raises his hands in disbelief; it's hard not to see how this scene foreshadows more tragic events that would face the unfortunate descendants of these people. And while remembering this scene, from Topol's eyes, I understand and I respect how the movie speaks for a whole community.And because I knew I was going to evoke some tragic events, I'll end this review on a more positive note by fulfilling my promise with Homer Simpson's quote: ""I have rented ""Fiddler on the Roof"" and I will watch it. Anyhoo, can I have $50,000?"" This desire for money I will forever associate with the iconic ""If I Was a Rich Man"", one of the greatest moments in musicals history. Topol has such a communicative energy that I wish I could have joined his yubby-dibby-dibby-dums, to a feverish and passionate dance. This whole 'Ya Da' part, and the extraordinary ""To Life"" song with the dancing scenes evoke a sense of male fraternity reminding me that I share the same roots of these people if we go till Abraham or the hell with it that we're all part of a same humanity, with traditions, as a clever way to forget about death and raise all our glasses  to Life !",Fiddler on the Roof
23,g-bodyl,Rather Strong Musical!,8,27 October 2015,"Fiddler on the Roof is a solid musical and is actually a little better than I anticipated. Set in pre-revolutionary Russia, this film describes the life of Jewish peasantry and how their way of life faces off against more modern times. I found the movie to be quite a learning experience, as my knowledge of Russian history really begins at the Bolshevik takeover. This is the earliest film I remember seeing of legendary composer, John Williams. He does a magnificent job adapting the music from stage to screen. I loved some of the songs such as ""Tradition"" and ""If I was a rich man."" For the most part, I loved the choreography. However, I was oddly bothered at some of the dancing, especially from Topol's character. It just didn't seem to strike a chord with me. I loved the production design and the cinematography. Despite its advancing age, the film still looks beautiful.Norman Jewison's film is a musical that takes place in pre-revolutionary Russia. A country that is struggling to modernize itself. Perhaps some of the reason is the Jewish peasants, who believe in their traditions. Tevye is a milkman who is poor and lives with his wife and five daughters. As the matchmaker suggests matches for his eldest daughters, Tevye has to deal with changing ways of life as his family attempts to break tradition.If you want to see a popular film that has a no-name cast, don't look further than this film. Until my initial viewing of this film, I have never heard of anyone in this cast. But I feel they all do reasonably well in their roles. Topol does a good job as Tevye. He looks to be an old man, but he was only in his 30's when this film was released. His singing was pretty good too. The pain he shows as he realizes tradition is crumbling all around him is pretty darn heart-breaking. The rest of the cast features unknown names such as Norma Crane as Golde, Tevye's wife and Leonard Frey as Motel, a lover of Tevye's eldest daughter.Overall, Fiddler on the Roof is an often entertaining musical filled with excellent songs and a score that puts the majestic John Williams on the map. The choreography is hit or miss and the film feels a little stretched. But the film does a good job in portraying peasant life during Czarist Russia and how difficult life can be for them, and how tradition unites their people. The beginning and end shots are beautiful, and what gives this movie the title it has. They are my favorite shots of the movie.My Grade: B+",Fiddler on the Roof

25,atlasmb,A Great Musical,10,7 March 2015,"Much was made of director Norman Jewison's decision to cast Topol (instead of Broadway's Zero Mostel)as Tevye, but his performance is the single most important factor that makes this a great film. Topol's portrayal has an earthiness to it that makes the farmer/milkman feel authentic. When he pushes his awkward cart through the landscape, you can feel his exhaustion.Jewison also does a great job integrating the music into the action. Songs like ""Do You Love Me?"" and ""Sunrise, Sunset"" spring organically from the action. The film's themes are universal in nature. Even in his small village, Tevye cannot avoid a changing world. It challenges his beliefs and threatens his beloved traditions. Eventually, it changes every aspect of his life. Finally, he realizes that what his daughter says to him is true--home is where your love is.Virtually every aspect of this film is excellent, from the dancing to the cinematography. And the cast is wonderful.",Fiddler on the Roof
26,Dr_Coulardeau,It has aged but improved,10,14 June 2009,"An old film of the double feature time with intermission music but no exit music is a great pleasure to reminisce about these old days. But has that film aged well or just grown old? The story is well known and the problems it contains and deals with are extremely serious. The anti-Semitism of the beginning of the 20th century in Russia, in fact next to Kiev, which makes it the Ukraine but under the Czar anyway. The various approaches are all the same in the end: traditions are the normal rule in this small community but the world is changing and many of these traditions are flying away like pollen in the wind: the matchmaker is waning out under the pressure of love, the exclusive community that does not allow any mixed activities, particularly love is breaking up on these very rocks named love, the fact that men dance with men and women dance with women falls down like a sand castle under the tide, etc. The first daughter marries within the Jewish community to a hard working young tailor she loves, against the first agreement negotiated by her father to get married with the rich but at least middle-aged butcher. The second daughter runs after a young communist who is arrested and deported to Siberia to get married there, with her father's blessing and permission .This second daughter was already difficult but the young communist was a Jew. Quite different is the third daughter. She gets married outside the community, outside the faith, in the orthodox tradition because she falls in love with a young orthodox Russian. She will get her father's blessing in extreme conditions. The last two daughters are too young still to get married, and even to fall in love.The film is rather interesting in the way it shows poverty within dignity or dignity within poverty, the way it depicts all kinds of traditions like the matchmaker, Sabbath, a Jewish marriage, bottle dancers, a very tamed pogrom episode during the marriage celebration, with some surprising anachronisms like pumpkins and corn, I mean Indian corn. These were imported from America and it is surprising they had reached the Ukraine so early and as the dominant crops of a Jewish community in a small village. But after all why not? We can and may believe in miracles.But the best part of the film is the music, the songs, one long and haunting tune ""If I were a rich man"" that comes back over and over again. That's maybe a good song, though a little surprising and in some way a cliché about the dream of all Jews to be rich one day. The constant asking God to do something for these Jews, for this one in particular speaking now hence always coming from the concerned person sounds slightly like begging for God's help and favor. This is too much centered on faith. The Jewish attitude is action first that has to be in obedience to God's commands and rules, and faith in God of course and in the knowledge that God is not at the service of the elected people who have to help themselves first, and we are back to action. When the community gets the order to leave within three days they accept their lot, pack and go. Apparently it did not go that easy in many cases. Maybe the final images of this exodus and the very final image of the poor milk farmer and his wife and the three daughters who are left, the tailor who is the husband of the eldest daughter and their baby, the milk farmer pulling the cart with their few belongings and behind them the Fiddler who has come down from the Roof, a mythical vision the milk farmer has in his mind's eye all the time, is no longer an exodus but rather a new Diaspora of a scattered community that has become isolated individuals or families. That makes this film mythical if not mystical and yet slightly old. We do not look at this period and at this situation with such clichés in mind. Things were hard, very violent, bloody but also collective and with a deep inner sense of resistance in the name of survival, as if God could only go on existing if the Jews did not die all of them: the survival of the elect to perpetuate God. That inner resistance is not really captured and shown and the synagogue is vacated and the rabbi goes away with the sacred artifacts without any protest, without any help from the community and he disappears in the crowd in no time.Too bad because the film has great qualities.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",Fiddler on the Roof

It is so sui generis that only ""Rich man ""has much of a life outside the show,but all the other songs fit beautifully in their proper context. Topol is extraordinary,and I use that term in the full knowledge that most of the time nowadays it is taken to mean merely very good.

29,PWNYCNY,Tradition? What tradition? Welcome to Tevye's world.,7,12 March 2013,"This movie attempts to recreate the story that most appropriately belongs on the stage. This is because the story is a play and is pure theater. To present it as something else does a disservice to the story. Showing the trials and tribulations of a Jewish man in Czarist Russia can inspire feelings of empathy; put it to music on the wide screen and it attracts attention but seems a little out of place. Technically the movie is excellent; most of the cast give credible performances, but the dramatic punch just misses the mark. Now, this movie contains the song ""Tradition"" which is song by Tevye and his family. If there is one thing this movie is not about, it's tradition. If anything, this movie is about change, relentless change, that totally sweeps tradition aside. By the end of the movie, Tevye's life is completely changed and all the landmarks of his life have been swept away, like what happened to Scarlet O'Hara in Gone With the Wind, except in the latter movie no one sings about it; there's nothing to celebrate. Tevye is lucky to be leaving, or rather fleeing, from Anatevka alive; it's a good thing he was friends with the local Cossack sheriff. Tevye's wife is so shrill that it's a wonder that he didn't leave sooner. As further evidence that tradition is dead, his daughters get married and leave, leaving him to ponder why. It's sad because for Tevye his world is changing and he cannot stop it. Welcome to Tevye's world.",Fiddler on the Roof

I could scarcely believe that I had never seen such a famous movie as ""Fiddler on the Roof"" but there it was in the listings, and I indeed had not. So, I took the three hours and invested it in Norman Jewison's rendering of the famous play. I am not really a fan of musicals, but this one had such charm. Especially from the performance of Topol, who played a rough character with utter (well, I have to use the word again) charm. The (Acadamy award-winning) cinematography was excellent, and the direction unobtrusive. I even liked some of the music. I was already aware of the pogroms and other indignities (to put it mildly) inflicted upon the inhabitants of the Jewish Pale, but I cannot recall ever seeing a movie showing any of it.

32,Steffi_P,"""Here's to whatever comes""",10,3 October 2011,"Across the 1960s all the movie genres that had developed in the previous two decades underwent massive changes – the old biblical epics disappeared completely, the Westerns and gangster movies became almost unrecognisable. Then there was a new generation of musicals – avant-garde, burlesque-influenced, many of them brilliant but in a category of their own. And yet, musicals of the older format clung on for a surprisingly long time, rubbing shoulders with their more modern cousins. Fiddler on the Roof, adapted in 1971 from a 1964 stage show, is one of the last great classic musicals.Of course, Fiddler on the Roof is not as old-fashioned as all that. Although the Broadway musical was long dominated by writers of a Jewish background, the idea of doing a show using Hebrew melodies was only really thinkable in a more flexible era. And the score by musician Jeremy Bock and lyricist Sheldon Harnick just happens to be one of the finest musical scores ever written, with a canny and emotional union of melody and rhythm with words and meanings. For example, in the song ""Tradition"" there is a verse – each with its own different melody – for fathers, mothers, sons and daughters, respectfully. Then the father and daughter verses play together, creating a lovely harmony while emphasising that this is a story of father-daughter relationships. ""Matchmaker"" features some incredibly clever lyrics, moving from dreamy thoughts of ideal men and working round to a consideration of the realities of arranged marriage, with such poetry that combined with the sweet, flighty tune creates a sublime and poignant beauty. There is not a single weak song in the score, and the whole thing is perfectly structured, moving from the mighty ""Tradition"" to the delicate ""Matchmaker"", to the bombastic ""If I Were a Rich Man"" to the haunting ""Sabbath Prayer"" and so on.The director of this screen version is Norman Jewison, always a filmmaker of musical sensibilities. There is a lot of rhythmic editing in Fiddler on the Roof, perhaps a rather facile technique, but Jewison mixes it up with a lot of on-the-beat movement, a kind of choreography of everyday actions, often taking care to make each shot ""agree"" rhythmically with the one preceding it. In the scene where we are introduced to Golde and the daughters, almost every time there is a new speaker we get a cut, an angle change and a camera move. By making those techniques occur simultaneously Jewison lessens out the impact of each, getting that hurried, busy feeling without making it look over-edited or artificial. He's also very good at making the action slide gracefully into a song, such as the pan into a close-up that opens the song ""Matchmaker"". He doesn't need a massive shift in technical style when a song begins, so the whole thing flows very smoothly and naturally.At the heart of the movie is of course that gigantic performance from Chaim Topol. He has a brilliant dancing style, a kind of mix of big-armed gesture and a really unrestrained segueing into the song. He could probably not do anything really athletic or precise, but his feeling for the music is clear. During the talking scenes, he's brilliant at bringing himself down to a level of serious contemplation, then suddenly bursting it with a comically angered outburst. Norma Crane manages to match him in presence, and yet with a more natural, sober turn. And Leonard Frey plays the stereotypical gangly youth, believably bringing out some forcefulness during his confrontation with Topol. Those familiar with English sitcoms can look out for before-they-were-famous appearances from Ruth ""Hi-de-hi campers"" Madoc hamming it up magnificently as the spectral Fruma Sarah, and Roger Lloyd ""Trigger"" Pack in a bit part as the sexton.The music and the people bring to life a story that is wonderfully touching and ultimately rather bleak, as many later musicals often could be. And this is where Fiddler on the Roof really seems to span the trends of the old and the new. The triumph of love has of course long been the preoccupation of the musical, but the triumph of love over tradition does chime in very well with the spirit of the age in which this picture and its stage predecessor were produced. But aside from this context, Fiddler on the Roof's warm humanity, larger-than-life characters and beautiful music make it one of the genre's greats, a movie that can be enjoyed today and by generations to come.",Fiddler on the Roof
33,Spleen,One of the best of all musicals,10,23 January 2000,"The range and audacity of `Fiddler on the Roof' is stunning.  By comparison today's musicals are timid, quaking things, terrified of frightening their audiences away however much `social relevance' bravado they may assume. This old musical is older than it looks.  The film dates from 1971; the musical itself from 1963; but even then it was clear that it was the last of its kind, a delayed swan-song from the 1950s.  There's sentiment, but no promise of a happy ending; humour, but not a trace of postmodern knowingness; realism, but and a willingness to indulge in fantasy, too. Musicals can't really survive without fantasy, and `Fiddler', along with `West Side Story', may very well mark the limit of just how serious it is possible to get without losing it.  The songs are uniformly good.  I don't know if Bock's music was usually so fitting, or if he happened to strike gold just once - not that it matters.As for the film ... I only wish I'll get a chance to see it in a cinema, for the photography is beautiful - and it IS the photography that's doing it, since we're made to realise that neither the village nor its setting is picturesque in itself.  Norman Jewison has assembled a cast not one member of which jars and makes the most of it.  This film is quite long, and feels longer, but neither length nor apparent length is a liability.",Fiddler on the Roof
34,mike48128,One of the Best Musical Adaptations of All Time,10,6 November 2012,"You can tell by the reviews just who is watching this film. Young people don't understand it. Although you don't have to be Jewish to appreciate it, at least being from Eastern European or Russian heritage surely helps. After the intermission the entire ""personality"" of the movie changes and becomes more melancholy and sad, for the most part.It is a lot like the ""Sound of Music"" in the fact that it totally fictionalizes what really happened under Tsar Nicholas II in 1905 when this movie takes place. Fifteen hundred people died that year in ""pogroms"" which are the ethnic cleansing of minorities. The Jews were literally forced out of their homes by the Tsar's edicts. ""Anatevka"" is a fictitious settlement in rural Russia. The Jews, as always, were forced to live apart from the Christian settlement of the town, which was obviously Russian Orthodox. Like ""Sound of Music"" nobody dies in the film. The Russians are mean but not murderous. If only real life was like that.As an adaptation of a musical, it is almost flawless. The songs are wonderful and carry the storyline, yet do not impede it. Topal, in the best film role of his life, surpasses even Zero Mostel, who did the stage version. Topol plays middle-aged ""Tevye"" yet in reality he is only 38 years old. His accent is occasionally ""wrong"" as he pronounces several words with a slight ""English"" accent, although he is Israeli. The soundtrack is wonderful and the scenery makes the story seem ""real"" instead of just a filmed stage production. It was filmed in Yugoslavia. It is the best film that Norman Jewison ever produced and directed. The only faults I can ""see"" are in the DVD video transfer (done in 2001 by DVCC) which perhaps has been redone since and better(?). The sound is a good transfer, but the video suffers from ""video noise"", minor scanning errors, and some film dirt and wear. (The ""master"" was degrading.) It is a ""one disk"" copy of what should have been at least 2 disks, and shows some compression, as the film is 3 hours.Like Gone With the Wind, The Ten Commandments, Sound of Music, Kings of Kings, and other great films, it belongs in your collection although it will only be watched occasionally. The last time I watched it, I mostly used ""scene selection"" and viewed the great musical numbers.The many dance sequences (the Russian Bar Dance, The Wedding, Chava's Ballet) equal those of 7 Brides for 7 Brothers in complexity and beauty. ""Tevye's Dream"" is hysterically funny. ""Stunning, joyful and jubilant""-quote from the NY Daily News. To life!After many years of reading ""Fiddler"" reviews, I feel I must add a ""footnote"" about Tevye declaring his daughter ""dead"" after she marries outside of her faith. This is in no way unique to just Orthodox Jewish ""Tradition"" and is found in many other strict religions as well.",Fiddler on the Roof
35,LeonardKniffel,One of the Best of the Best,10,29 April 2020,"The songs ""Sunrise, Sunset"" and ""If I Were a Rich Man"" are so embedded in our national brain that it is essential to see the show in which they first entered our head. One of the most successful Broadway musicals ever, its transfer to film is authenticated by the filming locations (Yugoslavia posing as Ukraine) and the realistic approach to the time (1905 in Tsarist Russia). The music itself is a marvelous blend of Tin Pan Alley and Russian folk music style. Like all the best musicals, this one does not shy away from religion or ethnic conflict; similarly it reinforces basic values of family, integrity, and morality. ""Do You Love Me?"" is one of the loveliest songs ever sung on film by two old lovers. What prevents this movie from being absolutely perfect is that at three hours it is simply too long, obscuring its message of simplicity. ---from Musicals on the Silver Screen, American Library Association, 2013",Fiddler on the Roof
36,pyrocitor,"(**to the tune of 'Lechaim!'**) To Jewison (to Topol!), for making a film full of life!",10,15 February 2017,"""It's hard to be Jewish, it's hard to be Jewish, it's hard to be Jewish in Russia, yo!"" If this irreverent cutaway gag from TV's Community is indicative of Fiddler on the Roof's cultural presence in the 21st century (keeping in mind, this is the same generation that distilled Rent into ""Everybody has Aids!"" in 2004's cheerily crass Team America: World Police), it's a testament to how lovably unforgettable the story is to still incur such affectionate ribbing. But, endless revivals on and off Broadway aside, it's still primarily thanks to Norman Jewison's 1971 cinematic adaptation that the Fiddler flame continues to burn. The word 'timeless' is bandied about far too frivolously, but it's hard to find a more applicable candidate; more than 40 years after its release, the film is as infectiously watchable as ever. Furiously spirited and cunningly playful before revealing an underbelly of cavernous lamentation, Jewison's Fiddler on the Roof holds its place not only as one of the most unforgettable musicals of Classical Hollywood, but one of its most abiding, heartfelt delights. Like all the greatest musicals, Fiddler is timeless through its ability to translate an insightful glimpse into a specific sociocultural moment (the Russian-Jewish community uneasily navigating cultural persecution in pre-revolutionary Russia) into a swathe of universally relatable movie magic. From the opening number, where each reprise of ""Tradition!!"" brings more manic claustrophobia (thanks largely to Jewison's teasing editing, sonorously cutting between pieces of Jewish spiritual iconography to the beat), the film clearly establishes it will be doing everything in its power to poke at just that. Thankfully, the film's almost sitcom setup of each of beleaguered narrator Tevye's daughters (Rosalind Harris, Michele Marsh, & Neva Small; all slyly luminous scene-stealers) increasingly testing the boundaries of cultural transgression by marrying (gasp) for love always veers away from clichéd expectations enough to keep the film vibrantly unpredictable rather than the kind of saccharine staleness too many classical musicals dredge up. Instead, befitting the film's guiding metaphor, Jewison's directorial hand is steady as a rock. In spite of his film's voluminous run time and cascading emotional arc, balancing history, politics, and spirituality with humour, heart, and outrageously catchy musical numbers, Jewison's pacing is unflappably perfect. He finds an almost pristine level of cohesion, building each romantic crisis into the next in harmony with the brewing sociopolitical upheaval to circumvent any worries of episodic plotting. Similarly, his predilection towards the zaniness of his story not only infuses it with tremendous energy (just check out the expressionistic, ghostly insanity of Tevye's Dream to see Jewison's wackiness at full tilt), but makes the inevitable second half crash all the more agonizingly hopeless and despondent. Ahh, yes - that second half. Just as The Sound of Music is incomplete without its pesky Nazis, Fiddler's rumblings of ""trouble in the city"" come with eventual devastating consequence. Jewison wisely doesn't overplay the macro sociocultural turmoil, but merely sows seeds of revolt - a jab in the otherwise glib opening number (""we don't bother them, and so far they don't bother us""); a raucous engagement celebration turned heated cross-cultural dance battle, until escalating sharply with a bawdy matrimony turned hate crime arson. As silly as it gets, Jewison's Fiddler is just as unafraid to glare the horror of its historical atrocities straight in the face, until sputtering out with the crushing anticlimax of an enforced deportation, an ending too necessarily bleak to trivialize. Thankfully, Fiddler is too chock-full of unstoppably hummable tunes to ever become needlessly dour. The songs, naturally, are unforgettable enough to speak for themselves (though John Williams' rich, Oscar-winning background score does some considerable speaking of its own), so Jewison allows them to simply breathe, integrated into the narrative with such unceremonious muckiness that they feel all the more spontaneous and heartfelt when chirped by the mud-caked, visibly weary cast. In a more classical or more contemporary remake, the most iconic ballad, ""If I Were a Rich Man,"" would be accompanied by deluges of glitzy Broadway production values and dazzling choreography. Under Jewison's grainy, no-bullsh*t 1970s sensibilities, it has Topol shimmying alone in a grungy barn, imitating the braying of the livestock surrounding him. Chicago or Broadway Melody this ain't, but it's all the more enthusiastically authentic for it.Still, if there's a single roof tile that keeps this Fiddler upright, it's the legendary performance of Topol. He doesn't so much play Tevye as allow him to ooze out of every pore. Every grunt from his entirely credible Russian accent, every exhausted sag or mischievous prance, every sheepish grin or world-weary grimace, every indignant booming of ""TRADITION?!"" is so effortless they seem worlds away from the affectations of an actor: this is a wholly fleshed out, loving, hurting, human being on screen in front of us, and we can't help but love him with the entirety of our hearts. The play's 'Tevye talking to the audience/God' conceit may have been a risky prospect to translate into film, but in Topol's effervescent hands, we're too delighted to be invited into his monologue to split hairs. Supporting him, Norma Crane proves both hilariously cantankerous and deeply sweet as Tevye's prickly wife Golde, and watching the two of them share an incredulously clumsy romantic duet is one of the most adorable moments ever committed to celluloid. Finally, Leonard Frey is hugely affable and goofy as the mousy suitor of Tevye and Golde's oldest daughter, while Starsky and Hutch's Paul Michael Glaser raises laughs aplenty as an endearingly self-righteous revolutionary turned romantic. Wonder of wonders, miracle of miracles - dispelling all fears of datedness, Fiddler on the Roof retains its worthy place as one of the essential, canonical movie musicals, sure to capture hearts and leave generations of audiences whistling ""If I Were a Rich Man,"" no matter how they're prompted to experience it. After all, it IS, evidently, hard to be Jewish in Russia... yo. -10/10",Fiddler on the Roof
37,BrandtSponseller,"On the other hand, the good book says that this is an excellent film",10,5 June 2005,"Epic in plot, setting and length, Fiddler on the Roof tells a surprisingly tight and focused story that has ""universal"" poignancy--in a nutshell, it's about trying to maintain strong cultural traditions and identity in the face of a continually changing world, partially fueled by the youth, that doesn't necessarily share the culture's values or self-assessment of worth.The plot is based on short stories written around the turn of the 20th Century by Sholom Aleichem, who was often called the ""Russian Mark Twain"". Aleichem wrote a number of works based on his character Tevye the Milkman, who has seven daughters (in the film, this was pared down to five). They live in the fictional Jewish shtetl (""village"", or ""little town or city"") of Anatevka in Tsarist Russia in the early 1900s. The stories are ""slice of life"" stuff. A lot of attention is paid to Tevye's daughters and their potential suitors. One of the prominent conflicts with tradition is a struggle with arranged marriages versus marriages for love, but of course, being set in pre-revolutionary Russia, there are also political changes brewing, some of which have a profound affect on Tevye's family and village.Aleichem's Tevye stories were first turned into a Broadway musical, which began its initial run in 1964 with Zero Mostel as Tevye. Producer and director Norman Jewison, who had had success with films like In the Heat of the Night (1967) and The Thomas Crown Affair (1968), and who was experienced as a producer and director for musical-oriented televisions shows, including ""Your Hit Parade"" (1950) and ""The Judy Garland Show"" (1960), was asked around early 1970 by United Artists to helm the Fiddler on the Roof film. To their surprise, Jewison wasn't Jewish. He got the gig anyway, and in August 1970, began an arduous shoot--much of it done in a small village in Yugoslavia that refused to cooperate when it came to weather (Jewison couldn't get the snow he wanted). He ended up getting a lot of pressure because the shoot went over time and over budget--this was one of the most expensive films of its time, which was an era of economic woes for Hollywood--but of course we know it paid off in the end.Zero Mostel was out as Tevye, and Israeli actor Chaim Topol, or just ""Topol"", was in, based largely on Jewison seeing him in the role of Tevye in the London stage production of Fiddler. Jewison had said that he was shooting for more realism in the film, as opposed to what he saw as a kind of campy humor in the Broadway production.In my eyes, Jewison ended up with a bit of both approaches in his finished film, but that's all for the better. Sequences like the opening ""Tradition"" montage are hilarious in their juxtaposition of a grand operatic attitude and the rhythmic coordination of cleaning fish, hanging slabs of meat, and so on. Yes, a lot of Fiddler is very realistic, but it's equally humorous and surrealistic most of the time.The realism is largely thanks to the authentic settings, the fabulous production and costume design, and of course, the superb performances. The humor is a factor of the above with that Mark Twain-ish aspect of Aleichem's stories and the fine script by Joseph Stine.The surrealism comes largely by way of the cinematography. Some of the visual sense is reminiscent of Marc Chagall's early work and his later, nostalgic depictions of his native Russia, and in fact, the image of the fiddler on the roof comes directly from a Chagall painting. Jewison saw the fiddler as a cross between a metaphor for the Jewish spirit (and this is explained in more detail via a few lines of dialogue in the film) and an actual physical manifestation of a spirit. However we interpret the fiddler, the shots of him and his presence in the film are certainly poetic. Jewison also gives us some fabulous, surreal, wide landscape shots, such as those of agricultural fields and the beautiful ""wasteland"" in which the train tracks are set. There are a few scenes set on the banks of a river, overlooked by a bridge, that are reminiscent of particular Van Gogh paintings. And as a more subtle bit of surrealism, Jewison had cinematographer Oswald Morris shoot much of the film though a woman's stocking--the mesh is very clearly visible in some exterior shots. Of course, there are also a couple more surrealistic touches in the plot, my favorite being the Tevye's Dream sequence, which features traditionalist Jewish zombies in an operatic attitude.A musical couldn't be a 10 without great music, and Fiddler on the Roof has it. The songs are a marvelous melding of traditional Russian folk melodies, with appropriate twinges of Orientalism and the expected Broadway sound, but maybe leaning a bit closer to a modern opera. From that description, you might think that the music would be a mess, but all of the songs are inventive and catchy. They are seamlessly melded with the drama, furthering the narrative as they should. The choreography is excellent and it is well shot by Jewison. And Isaac Stern's violin solos are outstanding, of course.Fiddler on the Roof takes an investment of time--it's three hours long, but it's well worth it. It offers great drama, great music, great humor and great tragedy in a beautiful package--you'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll sing, and you just might break a leg trying to dance.",Fiddler on the Roof

39,proud_luddite,Superb work by Jewison,9,11 November 2018,"Based on the Broadway musical, the story takes place in a small Jewish community in a rural area of Tsarist Russia. Tevye (Chaim Topol) is a poor milkman with five daughters, three of whom are reaching adulthood. He has difficulty with the more modern attitudes of his daughters while the community faces danger from the lingering anti-Semitism from outside.Director Norman Jewison has done a superb job with this beautiful film which is exquisitely photographed by Oswald Morris. The camera movements as well as the framing of each scene perfectly add to the emotions generated by the story and, of course, those great songs by Jerry Bock and Sheldon Harnick. Jewison also shows great skill with crowd scenes.The first half of this three-hour film has musical numbers that are boisterous and breathtaking. The best include ""Tradition"" (with a superb montage that reflect the community's working and religious life); the title song, played by the title character, during the opening credits (with a sunset background to die for); ""Matchmaker"" (amusing and well choreographed); ""If I Were a Rich Man"" (where Tevye gets uncharacteristically lively); ""To Life"" (brilliant dancing); and ""Sunrise, Sunset"" mixed with a vigorous and lively wedding scene.In the second half, the mood changes significantly with the story. The joy and humour (or at least as much joy as one can find while being poor), turns to sadness and melancholy. The song ""Anatevka"" enhances this dour mood as the preceding songs enhanced the happier times. The final sequence might seem prolonged but it brilliantly makes the heart cry with admiration for those who can still move ahead with resilience. The level of detail is very effective. Thankfully, the film ends with a medley of songs to alleviate the viewers' drained hearts.The performances are mixed but mostly good. Topol stands out in the main role. His eyes alone convey so much emotion. And his occasional conversations with God are delightful. He is convincing in his portrayal of someone who is almost resigned to his situation but can also release an outburst now and then.On social issues, ""Fiddler"" is rightly renowned for exposing part of the history of anti-Semitism. But it can also be credited for exposing the daily grinds of the working poor.

41,Karl Self,Disney meets progrom,2,15 November 2008,"Mel Brooks probably made the best comment on ""Fiddler On The Roof"" by casting the original study (of the stage musical) Zero Mostel as the lead of his seminal parody, ""The Producers"". Here, Mostel, in the role of bankrupt producer Max Biyalistok, tries to pull one over The Fiddler and turns the Nazi régime into a musical, ""Springtime For Hitler"". Apparently, even Brooks had his limits and so he didn't take the ultimately logical step of musicalizing Auschwitz.Brooks must have felt what I felt when I saw the depiction of orthodox Jewish life, poverty, forced marriages, progroms and eviction through the means of a musical: my jaw hit the floor at so much brazen presumptuousness.The shame about The Fiddler On The Roof is that it has a likable if conventional story at its heart. A simple but spirited father has to come to terms with the changing times, that his daughters will pick their own husbands rather than having a marriage arranged for them (which mostly meant being married off to rich, old men). I suspect it's that part of the story (along with lead actor Chaim Topol's congenial charisma) that many people like best about ""The Fiddler"". Fathers, mothers and daughters can all identify with this situation. Sons'll just have to sit it out, I guess.But that aside, wow, what a stinker. I've heard that some Jews consider this to be ""their"" musical / movie. For example I have read about one father who showed ""The Fiddler"" umpteen times to his daughters to explain Judaism to them. After having seen this movie, I think that guy is out of this world. This movie is just so damn trivial. Poverty is fun, orthodox Judaism means lots of singing and dancing in funny clothes, and that progrom, as far as progroms go, was certainly a bit on the farcical side, especially when those three hoodlums inhumanely tore that table cloth apart. Oh, the humanity.I couldn't work out what the eponymous fiddler character was about, so I googled that it was an image from Marc Chagal which had originally been incorporated into the stage design. As a graphic motif it probably made sense, but this effect is lost when we actually see the guy jamming away on his roof, and lead character Reb Tevye extols: ""A fiddler on the roof -- sounds crazy, no?"". Hell yes, Tevye. Crazy. Cliché. Forced. Gag me with a tongue depressor. He makes about as much sense as a euphonist in the cellar. Don't tell me you named the entire film after this sorry freak?This musical bored and upset me for almost three solid hours. And I didn't even dig the songs.

42,johno-21,A musical for the ages,10,20 March 2006,"I saw this film during it's initial theatrical release and have seen it many times since. I am not especially a fan of musicals and there are very few that I like but this is one of those few. Fiddler on the Roof ran on Broadway from 1964 to 1972 and received a special Tony Award in 1972 for being the longest running musical in Braodway history. In addition it was nominated for nine Tony Awards for 1965 winning eight of them. The popularity of the plays Broadway run spawned Off Broadway performances worldwide from professional theater companies to high school productions. Joseph Stein wrote the screenplay for the filmed version adapted from his book which was based on stories by Sholom Aleichem. The wonderful music of Fiddler on the Roof is from the songwriting team of composer Jerry Bock and lyricist Sheldon Harnick. Director Norman Jewison had never done a musical before and was best known for the drama In the Heat of the Night and the comedies The Russians Are Coming, The Russians Are Coming and The Art of Love. He would direct another musical after Fiddler in Jesus Christ Superstar but would find more success in Moonstruck, A Soldier's Story and ..And Justice For All. Veterna Cinematographer Oswald Morris who was familiar with musicals having photographed Scrooge and Oliver was known for his cinematography in such films as Lolita, Mobey Dick, Goodbye Mr. Chips and The Guns of Navarone. the film Fiddler on the Roof was immediately embraced b the public and received critical acclaim and received eight Academy Award nominations including Best Picture and Best Director and won three Oscars for Best Cinematography, Musical Score and Sound. the film's setting takes place in the Jewish village of Anatevka, Russia in the year 1905. I interviewed a 101 year old Jewish woman three years ago who was born in a small village outside of Minsk, Russia in 1902 and lived there until 1920. In asking her to describe her village she referred to this film and said it was exactly like what was depicted in the movie. I can't think of a better testament to the production of this film than having someone who lived in a similar village during the time it was set in to see her past in this film. At three hours this runs a little long and it's hard to capture a successful musical stage play on film but this comes as close as you can get.

By itself, Fiddler has a profoundly beautiful story about a father's reckoning with a changing society, a persecution of his people and the loss of control over his own daughters. Tevye is a flawed protagonist. He tries, and ultimately fails in sending off his three daughters to the men that they love. All the while, he argues with an omnipresent God who never gives him the answers that he is looking for. This is a sad story about life. A life that can be beautiful and a life that can be cursed, and ultimately, a life decided, not by God, but by our own destiny. It's three hours of incredible entertainment.

44,gab-14712,Wish I Seen This Before!,8,18 October 2017,"I was a little late to the game when it came to Fiddler on the Roof. It seemed to be a movie every single person has seen, but now I have joined the party. Based off the very famous stage play, this film takes place in a pre-revolutionary village in Russia where there is a mixture of the Jewish and Christian people whom each have their own traditions. This film has a major theme in tradition, told from the view of the Jewish peasantry. The message regarding tradition is that times change and sometimes tradition has to be changed to keep up with the changing times. This film particularly talks about traditional marriage within a Jewish family, and how some events changed the very old traditions. Not only is the film about tradition or culture, but you can learn some history. This movie has a setting in pre-revolutionary Russia just before the Russian Revolution of 1918. The Jewish people are being exiled from their home over the course of the film to places like Israel or even Chicago. One of the iconic figures in the movie was the fiddle player-hence the title name. The fiddle player is shown in two very iconic shots-one at the opening and one at the end. This is a symbol for the tolerance or the forbearance of the Jewish people in the movie.This film, which is well-directed by Norman Jewison, is a musical that takes place in pre-revolutionary Russia (just barely). This is a country that struggles to modernize. Maybe a reason is because of the Jewish peasantry, whom hold dear to their traditions. One of the traditions is having a matchmaker pair up matches for people who are of age to marry. There is Trevye (Topol), who is a poor milkman who has five daughters of his own-three ready to marry. The matchmaker, of course, pairs his daughters up. But instead of arraigned marriages, the daughters find love. The eldest daughter falls in love with a poor furniture-maker and his second-eldest falls in love with a Marxist, causing anguish in Trevye as he sees tradition falling apart. Meanwhile, revolution is spreading across the country forcing all Jewish people to leave their homes and their country.This film, just like the stage play, is a musical. There are a lot of songs and dancing. I liked most of the songs, but two that stood out to me were ""Tradition"" which was the opening number as Trevye discusses the tradition of his people and ""If I Were A Rich Man"" which as Trevye lamenting his life and wondering how different it would be if he had money. From what I heard, the music is very faithful to the play. But there were a couple new songs added specifically for the film. It shouldn't be a surprise how good the music is because the legendary John Williams is at the helm as composer-one of his very first gigs in the film industry. As for the dancing, there is a good amount of choreography. I liked that Jewison made the dancing appropriate for the movie audience, not the play audience. Older musicals had problems where I felt I was watching a play, not a musical. Anyhow, there is a rather strange dislike about the dancing of Trevye. He moves his hands in such a weird fashion. I was like, ""Dude, don't make me tie your hands up when you are dancing!"" The film is reasonably well-acted. When I saw the cast, I haven't heard of a single name. Topol apparently is a well-respected Israeli actor and other than those distracting hand movements, he did a wonderful job. His singing was emotionally-charged as everything around him changes. He is a man of tradition, but even he can be persuaded. When asked by his daughters about marriage, he goes on a rant each time with God pleading why this has to happen to him. They are powerful scenes that rightfully nominated him for an Oscar. Leonard Frey as Motel, the lover of the eldest daughter does a solid job. I love his scene where he builds a sowing machine with giddy delight and holds it as if its his own baby. As for the daughters, I can't recall any names. They are just there to fall in love and play daughter to their father. They didn't have much characterization.Nominated for eight Oscars and winning three of them, Fiddler on the Roof is a very faithful adaptation of the Broadway musical. I didn't go nuts over the film, but it's perfectly enjoyable. It's nice to learn about the history and culture of a group of people (from Russia) I did not know too much about. I studied the Russian Revolution, but not so much what happens before. The music is mostly enjoyable and keep an eye out for the fiddle player. The film is very lengthy, but this is an adaptation that pleased fans of the play and general musical fans over the years.My Grade: B+",Fiddler on the Roof

In this setting a peasant farmer wants to marry off his three daughters - but he only gets trouble, trouble, trouble...The film musical is a strange fish in that it can be an absolutely brilliant way to tell a story or the worst. However well you to put it- the sight of people suddenly bursting in to song to make a point or illustrate information is quite strange and there are many that can't quite get their heads around it. Certainly it shouts ""this is not real life"" more than any device in the history of cinema and you half expect the camera to pan around and watch the orchestra playing the music! The format works far more effectively when the central music is also central to the theme itself. Such as in A Star is Born or Cabaret. We expect music to sung on a stage - but in the middle of a street with people passing by as if this was the most normal thing in the world?The music in Fiddler is only average and strangely dated even for the time it was made. It wasn't a film musical that ""had to be made"". In If I Was a Rich Man we have an all-time classic and in Sun Rise/Sun Set a minor classic - but the rest is mediocre, although sometimes made brilliant by fantastic dance or visuals. We can't go back in time and understand Topol (the poor farmer) any more than we can understand MacBeth. We have had too much education. He sees himself as a man whose only goal is to continue to fight for his traditions and the idea of his daughter marrying a Gentile sends him in to apoplexy. We don't understand him today - indeed we are angry with his for his narrow mind - but this is the spool which his whole life is spun around.This film made me interested in history. To try and understand what is going on off screen. What the politics of the day were. My reading is that Jews were allowed certain plots of land because it was thought that they were hard workers who brought trade to an area - but they were not trusted and became something of a mixed blessing. The cruelty they suffered was often as a result of their own success - because success brings jealousy. I have only positive thoughts on this film. Yes, I wish the music was better and there was more of the fantastic dancing. I also wish that the politics of the day were better explained - although I don't know how.We know what lay in store for them (the Jews) later in life - but the lucky ones got to America a country that has always been their natural home. A place where hard work and success are admired and people don't come round to smash up your wedding - they simply don't let you join their golf club.",Fiddler on the Roof

No Broadway actor can top Israeli-born Topol as the proud patriarch Tevye, who is the head of a large family of girls in old Russia. I am never certain it's pre-World War II Russia (Communist Russia) or turn-of-the-century Russia before the Bolshevik Revolution. Topol narrates the film with a voice of tradition and old-time Jewish values and traditions. While the musical is innately Jewish, its heart-felt humanity makes it universal in its theme of love, loss, man's inhumanity to man and family values. The musical has memorable and hummable songs that have become part of our American musical heritage - ""If I Were A Rich Man"" was just recently made into a pop song vocalized by Gwen Stefani. ""Matchmaker, Matchmaker"" is full of sweet girlish exuberance and has a big gay following to it (what musical doesn't have a gay following ?). The acting is actually good for a musical and this really is more of a dramatic film anyways. The ""fiddler"" is none other than world-renowned classical violinist Isaac Stern who produces beautiful, Aramaic sounds mixed with what appears to be Mendelssohn. The cinematography is gorgeous- the small Russian town is charming in both winter and spring. We feel for these people, we experience life through their eyes, we cry with them, laugh with them, love with them. The most moving part is toward the ending. The youngest daughter Chava (Neva Small in a great performance) decides to break tradition and marry a non-Jew, a Russian intellectual who was won her heart. This warrants her father's fury and he disowns her, a very difficult thing that happens even today among some hardcore zealous Jewish conservative folk or for that matter Muslims or Hindus. She represents the new generation. When the Jews of the town are forced out of their home by national edict, this is also very sad. This musical is neither sugary and sentimental the way Sound of Music or South Pacific is but is instead a musical with a lot of heart and soul. It is quite possibly the best musical ever made.",Fiddler on the Roof
49,Isaac5855,One of the Very Best Adaptattions of a Stage Musical to the Screen,9,4 August 2006,"Norman Jewison had a directorial triumph with the 1971 film version of the Broadway musical FIDDLER ON THE ROOF, a beautifully mounted screen version of the classic Sheldon Harnick-Jerry Bock musical about the Jewish milkman and father of five daughters, who has his entire belief system challenged and thrown back in his face during this turbulent period in Jewish history. Tevye is a poor milkman struggling to keep food on the table for his wife and daughters but finds his whole way of thinking and the way he was brought up turned on him as his three eldest daughters have men come into their lives and his inner struggle as to whether honoring his own belief system is more important than the happiness of his daughters. His hardest challenge comes when his third daughter chooses to marry a man outside the Jewish faith. The Broadway musical made a star out of Zero Mostel, but I think Tevye turns in an electrifying performance as Tevye, that did earn him an Oscar nomination for Best Actor. His rendition of ""If I Were a Rich Man"" is a classic. Other musical highlights include ""Tradition"", ""Tevye's Dream"", ""Do You Love Me?"" and the rousing ""To Life"", which features most of Jerome Robbins' original choreography. One of the best transitions of a musical from stage to screen and a joy from start to finish.",Fiddler on the Roof

We see him as a man mired in traditions, but struggling between his devout faith and the changing times when three of his daughters feel the urge to marry.  The movie is beautifully shot, and tempers the story, which deals with the harsh realities of Jewish life in pre-Revolutionary Russia, with classic musical numbers sure to put a smile on your face.

52,braddugg,A tale worth knowing but it tests our patience.,6,19 September 2014,"A tale worth knowing but it tests our patience.I got to know of this through a friend Abhijeet Kulkarni (a big fan of singer Kishore Kumar) who ""I like it because its my idols favorite movie"" and watched it nearly 3 years back for first time. When I revisited it now I am just all over in love with it for the first hour, the second hour seemed dragging and I had to sit through 3rd just to finish it. Over three hours long, this tale of a family of Tevye (playe by Topol) becomes too sardonic and too painful by the end. Had it been a tad shorter, it would have just right up there as a great movie. Now, still its definitely a good movie and worth watching for many reasons. Top most reason being there to see Topol playing Tevye, the family runner, a man for a family. Topol is just so fine and brings so much more to the character Tevye is that there is no escape form empathizing, falling in love with Tevye and embracing him for the way he dealt with his things. Setup in 1900's Russia, this is a tale of a family of Tevye who has 5 daughters and he has to get them married, now tradition is what he believes in sticks to and he has to fore go a few beliefs too for his own family and he does that too and becomes so very humane. Now, did I ever mention that its a musical and oh wow, the music is so good, 'Matchmaker' and 'Do you love me' are two songs that are my favorites and will listen them over again and again. John Williams for sure has produced a supreme soundtrack and worth a collection. So is the cinematography and art direction which are simply superb.Now, editing is not up to the mark and this being a musical I agree it has less scope and it needed a large landscape to take us and make us delve into the niceties of such place and also its grave atrocities. It's great if looked at as a play for its completely performance oriented but as a movie, I wish it was just shorter by say half an hour.It's 3/5 for a good movie and definitely worth a watch for TOPOL and surely thanks to Kishore da and Abhijeet for making me watch this.",Fiddler on the Roof
53,thejcowboy22,Discovering my ancestry in a Musical,7,28 July 2017,"I often wondered what it was like in the old country Russia/Poland one hundred plus years ago? What was the daily riggers of life for my Grandfather and his Father's before him? How did they survive? Their livelihoods, customs, down time?? How they lived or survived the rugged lifestyle with out the modern conveniences? Not to mention the racial tensions created by the local regimes of that time, mainly ""antisemitism""? My Grandmother remembers the harsh winters in Lodz. My other Grandmother would describe the horrible senseless acts of a fearful group of individuals called the Pogroms. These tormentors would ride into the Jewish section on horseback with saber in hand and would slice the heads off the locals including woman and children. Just a small sample of the horrific acts by the government based group to annihilate the Jews of Europe. Despite the harshness of the living conditions, writer Sholom Aleichem presents the story of Tevya the Milkman and his family somewhere in the Ukraine at the turn of the twentieth century. Personally I saw this play performed for the first time at sleep away camp. Then I saw a professional production starring Hershel Bernardi as Tevya. My ex-Brother-In-Law played Tevya in his college production and the story is always captivating with song and dialogue. The film doesn't disappoint either as Topol plays a struggling milkman who tells his audience in a philosophical way his ideas on life as he looks toward the sky to ask G-d why things are? Tradition is most important to Tevya with out an explanation as to why? But because it's a tradition. Tevya has a wife of 25 years Golde (Norma Crane) does a capable job as the matriarch who cooks, cleans and has the Sabbath meal prepared unconditionally. They have five daughters but this story focuses on the three oldest and their love interests. First there's Tzeitel (Rosalind Harris).This was at a time when it was customary in Jewish law to have an arranged marriage done my a Matchmaker (Molly Picon)Yente. Grey,middle aged Lazar Wolf (Paul Mann)is looking for a second wife and Tzeitel fills the requirements under strong suggestion to the austere Tevya. Meanwhile Tzeitel is secretly meeting love interest Motel the tailor(Leonard Frey) and they want to be married but timid Motel has to tell Tevya that despite his hopes of a rich in-law, Motel and Tzeitel have a mutual love for each other and pay no heed to traditions. One of my personal favorite songs is Wonder of Wonders performed by Leonard Frey as his marriage will be a reality with a concocted dream by Tevya to pacify Wolf and Golde. The dream sketch was cleverly done in black and white. The second daughter Hodel (Michele Marsh) falls for a wondering radical Perchick (Paul Michael Glazer) who wants to go to Moscow and start a Marxist revolution against the Czar. Our third front or daughter is the Ginger haired Chava (Neva Small), who is an avid reader and meets a gentile boy who she eventually falls in love and marries against the wished of her parents as Tevya professed that his daughter is dead to him. Powerful scene in any production of the play. The songs are so familiar and the story on paper, serious in nature is still pleasant to watch. Our character do sprinkle a bit of humor despite the tense political climate brewing in Czarist Russia. Note Norma Crane who played Golde was in bad health during the film yet her performance was a adequate.The kind of play you can get lost in as you see your Jewish ancestry played out literally. Other cultures would ask what Judaism entails? I say watch this play and you'll get quite an education about Diaspora. How millions of Jews Emigrated to the United States because of racial problems and changing governments which prohibited certain religions. You'll enjoy the story and learn a few things about the Chosen People.",Fiddler on the Roof
54,roghache,"Ultimate perfection in a musical, and of course TRADITION",10,7 March 2006,"Although I'm not normally a great fan of musicals...people on the screen constantly bursting into song for no good reason generally irritate me...this one's a masterpiece. Story, theme, characters (especially the main one, Tevye), and of course, incomparable music.This musical is set in the Russian village of Anatevka during the early 1900's of the Tsarist regime. It tells the story of the village's Jewish inhabitants (Tevye's family, in particular), their traditions (and the disturbing trend toward departing from them), their hardships and persecutions, and most of all their optimism, camaraderie, humor, and especially faith in God through it all.Topol is magnificent as the main character, Tevye, the village milkman, who imparts to anyone who'll listen his pearls of wisdom from the Good Book and has conversations aloud (sometimes musical ones) with God, complaining good naturedly about his troubles and of course the importance of maintaining, yes... TRADITION. He's the father of five daughters and much of the story line revolves around the older three, who reject the old customs of the Matchmaker, Yente, and insist on choosing their own most unsuitable husbands... Tzeitel, who prefers the poor, shy, awkward but endearing tailor, Motel, to the much older, wealthy, ruddy faced butcher (Lazar Wolf) selected for her by her father; Hodel, who chooses a student activist, Perchik, even if it means exile in Siberia; and Chava, who defies her father by marrying a Gentile, Fyedka, in an Orthodox Christian Church. Teyve loves his daughters and always tries to see their choices from the alternate, optimistic side (""on the other hand""...), but some traditions are too difficult to see broken. The issue of Judaism notwithstanding, like all parents of faith even today, Tevye finds it much easier to deal with his son-in-law's economic or political unsuitability than with major religious differences.My personal favorite scenes are of Tzeitel's wedding...the magnificent cinematography, the beautiful candle lit procession, the solemnity of the sacred marriage vows under the Jewish canopy, the bride supposedly plain but absolutely radiant, the traditional breaking of the wine glass by the groom, all to the moving strains (tears fill my eyes even now) of the immortal ""Sunrise, Sunset"" which asks the timeless question of every parent at their offspring's wedding...where has the time gone? how did my child grow up so quickly?This film touchingly depicts the close knit village life (where everyone knows everyone else's business) but especially in relation to the threatening external forces, the pogroms of Pre Revolutionary Russia. Racial prejudice against these Jewish villagers is an ongoing theme, and nowhere is this more dramatically and touchingly revealed than at Tzeitel's wedding reception. I won't give away the details, but your emotional response will be outrage. It's a picture that's worth a thousand words. Lots of humor, too, especially in the interactions between Tevye and his devout, long-suffering wife, Golde. Now, this is a couple that knows the true meaning of love. For me, the funniest scene in this movie was the sewing machine, absolutely precious. Wonderful music of course throughout. The ""fiddler on the roof"" plays his hauntingly beautiful strains, especially effective during the moving, emotional ending. All the songs in this picture are catchy but, unlike most ditsy musicals, also have deep meaning. Everyone seeing this movie at the theatre left humming the incomparable, lively ""If I Were a Rich Man"". In fact, they're probably humming it still.If you haven't yet seen this musical...and you must be one of the few who haven't...then you absolutely MUST see it. Make sure your kids see it. It's just not acceptable to go through life without the benefit of Teyve's wisdom, and whether you can carry a tune or not, you'll be singing some of these songs in the shower for the rest of your life.",Fiddler on the Roof

It is also used by Tevye in the story as a metaphor for trying to survive in a difficult, constantly changing world. The best musical numbers: ""Tradition"", ""If I Were a Rich Man"", ""To Life"", & ""Miracle of Miracles"". Each of the performances had their highlights, but Topol, who played Tevye, stood far above the rest. Without him, I am not sure the musical would have been as impressive. The entire film had a down to earth, farm life feel. Thus, I was not so shocked as amused when I discovered that the entire film was shot with a pair of brown nylon stockings over the lens. The weave can even be detected in some scenes. One of the most fun, playful musicals I have seen. Which made the sudden ending all the more depressingly stark in contrast.",Fiddler on the Roof
56,NoArrow,The best musical ever made...,10,26 July 2003,"...""Fiddler on the Roof"" stars Topol as Tevye, a Jewish milk man (and father of five) living in a small town in the time before WWII.  The movie follows him over a long period of his life, mostly focusing on his three oldest daughters getting married, and Tevy's opposition towards their new husbands. Of course, it sounds a little depressing, but believe me, when you here the song ""If I Were A Rich Man"", you'll change your mind.Musicals tend to become boring about halfway through (or at the beginning if they're really bad) because of overly dramatic songs or over acting. ""Fiddler on the Roof"" doesn't fall into this category.  The songs please and warm your heart whenever they are sung, and the characters don't either overact or become boring.Topol is hilarious and dramatic as Tevye, the dancing and singing father who speaks to God (and the audience) out loud.  Topol narrates, sings, dances, and mingles joyfully with the other characters, never even coming close to slipping out of character.  Tevye will go down in my book as one of the most memorable protagonists...ever.The only thing going against ""Fiddler on the Roof"" is its monstrous running time.  Not because it gets boring, but because whenever you'd like to watch it, you have to make sure you have about four hours of spare time, 9/10.",Fiddler on the Roof
57,RiffRaffMcKinley,The *Real* Best Picture of 1971,10,1 August 2009,"The Oscars are run in a most peculiar way. Occasionally, the right film (""Ben-Hur,"" ""Amadeus,"" ""Return of the King,"" and more) is given the top prize. More often than not, total incompetence is rewarded (""Around the World in 80 Days,"" ""Titanic,"" and ""Crash""). And then you have those times when a great movie is snubbed because of a film that's not horrible, but still not in the same league. Classic examples: ""Slumdog Millionaire"" swiping ""Milk,"" and ""The French Connection"" coming out on top of Norman Jewison's incredible ""Fiddler on the Roof."" Well, ""Fiddler"" will always be the 1971 Best Picture in my mind. By far the best-acted movie musical of all time, it is also one of the most genuinely affecting and universally accessible. The story follows Tevye (played superbly by Topol), a wealth-challenged Russian Jewish milkman with a lot of faith, as he tries to survive a world in which so many people hate him for that faith. He also faces the courtship of his three oldest daughters-- the lovestruck Tzeitel, the feisty Hodel, and the shy Chava.Also incredible to think of is the fact that movie musicals were effectively dead when this was released. Gone were the glory days of ""Oklahoma,"" ""West Side Story,"" and so many others, replaced by audience indifference to perfectly capable offerings like ""Camelot"" and ""Doctor Dolittle."" This film could have been one of the most horrendous flops (until it would have been dethroned by the magnificently underrated ""Howard the Duck""), but it became something much bigger and better: a completely deserving success.The art direction, cinematography, costume design, acting, and screen writing are all plenty admirable here. But what really deserves most of the credit (besides Jewison's direction) is the score adaptation by none other than John Williams, the man whose iconic themes for ""Star Wars,"" ""Superman,"" and ""Indiana Jones"" will never leave people's heads.Still, the movie does have its faults. The film's ending is a slightly confusing mixture of ""downer"" and ""there's hope for a better tomorrow,"" kind of like ""Battle for the Planet of the Apes."" And in the titular Fiddler's few in-focus moments, he's not really given a good performance by Tutte Lemkow. But all things considered, ""Fiddler"" is rich, bewitching entertainment.",Fiddler on the Roof
58,TheHonestCritic,Is this the best movie about Jewish culture in cinema? Check out my review below to find out!,10,5 September 2020,"""Fiddler on the Roof"" (1971), I remember watching this movie back in school and enjoying it. I am part Jewish, my dad is Jewish and my mom is Christian. Being half Jewish and half Christian, when I first heard of this film, it sparked my interest. Sure enough, it did not disappoint! Then, when I watched it just recently, I enjoyed it just as much, if not more. ""Fiddler on the Roof"" has a perfect story, perfect acting, perfect sets/locations, perfect special effects, and a perfect soundtrack to tie it together. The storyline is based on the original Broadway play of the same name that came out in 1964. Usually, taking a play and transferring it to the big screen is hard to get right. However, this movie does the original play justice and then some! One thing to point out, the plot line synopsis makes this film sound a bit dull. But, the simplicity of this story is what helps it to shine. Normally, a movie with a simple storyline can be quite boring, but in the rare case of this film, it makes it all the more gripping from beginning to end. I like simplicity done right when it enhances the story, and this is no exception. The only nitpick of the storyline is the musical numbers. Most of them work, my personal favorite songs in this movie are: ""Tradition"" and ""If I Were a Rich Man"". The rest of the songs are good, but sometimes they come out of nowhere, especially if you're watching the movie for the first time. Some of the songs drag the plot to a halt and most of them occur randomly. Like, out of nowhere, a character will just suddenly start singing. These songs don't hurt the movie, but some of them the movie could've done without. As I said, it's a big nitpick and it doesn't ruin the storyline or the rest of the film at all. I still give the story a pass. One other thing to point out, the movie is three hours long. However, it goes by in the blink of an eye, which is impressive. For a film of that length to hold my interest all the way through and go by so fast, that's definitely a big accomplishment. Those two aspects are hard to nail, let alone both. All of the acting is fantastic from all of the actors and actresses and they really bring their respectable characters to life. There is one actor who really stands out, Chaim Topol, otherwise known professionally as just Topol. He plays the main character of the movie, Tevye. Here's a cool piece of history, Topol actually played the character in the original play. Isn't that cool? That's one of the biggest reasons why his performance is so good. He took his fully acquired knowledge of the story and transplanted it all into this role for the big screen. What results is a truly timeless performance! Plus, his great acting shows in the rest of the cast as well. All of the sets/locations are beautiful and gives the film a stunning atmosphere. Set in the fictional village of Anatevka, the sets/locations make you feel like you're in that time period and part of their town. All of the special effects are well-done and still hold up today. Finally, the soundtrack is perfect. Being adapted and composed by John Williams, that comes as no surprise. John Williams is my favorite music composer in all of cinema, and he never lets me down! ""Fiddler on the Roof"" is a cinematic marvel, both in storytelling and in Jewish culture. This movie, in my opinion, is the best Jewish film in history. Of course, I give this movie 5 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 10 out of 10 IMDB stars. If you haven't seen ""Fiddler on the Roof"", go check it out, especially if you're Jewish. I guarantee you'll love it!",Fiddler on the Roof

It has been said that if you are Jewish you will enjoy this film more. Even though I am Jewish I think it is great story and it doesn't matter if you aren't Jewish to love it. Truth be told i can count the musicals that I like on one hand. It is the genre I like te least. I just rarely get into people bursting into song in a film. But I love this film because it's story and performances are so strong.The story is well known. Topol stars as Tevye, a poor milkman in a Russian village called Anatevka. The story revolves around Tevye doing his job, worrying about marrying his daughters and most of all his daily conversations with G-d. Topol is so good as Tevye that you can't help.but love and feel for the character. His interaction with his family, especially his wife Golde are funny, endearing and times sad. Even though he is the film's main character the supporting characters are very strong. The cast is just as good as Topol. The film is long but never boring. It has a great mixture of music, comedy and drama. It deals with the persecution of Jews in the Russuan pogroms. But it focuses most on Tevye dealing with his faith and love for his daughters. He has a hard time accepting change to what he knows and tge traditions he holds dear. There are some heartbreaking scenes in this film, but it is ultimately hopeful.Even though the film centers around a Jewish village it could have been about any other group. It is relatable to any group. It is about not forgetting your past while accepting change.The film is funny, endearing, sad, and hopeful.I love it!!!Grade: A",Fiddler on the Roof

A film that is so educational that you can learn everything about the fascist era by just watching this film. On of the greats.

Of course, it's Topol who carries the burden of its success and he gives what is clearly the performance of a lifetime. As if he was born to play Tevye.

As with any great movie, it is a product that geometrically multiplies the visions and talents of its Director (Norman Jewison) by combining and extracting the best of the talents of his cast together with his technical crew members. 
As a written play, Fiddler On The Roof, was based on a script that was a true labor of love attempting to extract the best pearls of wit and wisdom from the remarkably rich legacy of humorist-essayist-philosopher Sholom Alechem. The superb musical play was heavy on wit and magnificently composed and choreographed musical numbers capturing-to-a-tee Alechem's spirit and indomitable drollery.  It had steep roots in the Yiddish theater and a perfect musical-comedy farceur to capture that spirit in Zero Mostel.Four years after winning the Oscar for the magnificent ""In The Heat of The Night"", Norman Jewison, a Canadian Christian, had the gall (in many eyes) to attempt to extract still more from his movie.  Rather than embrace the play's Yiddish theater roots, Jewison's movie is more about using Alechem's anecdotes and the brilliant music to capture the essence of the Russian town that Anatevka was at the turn of the century, replete with its distinctly rich Eastern European roots.  In order to do this, he made the bold, albeit unpopular choice, of eschewing Mostel and his New York roots for 33-years-young Israeli actor Chaim Topol who was a smash in the role on London's West End.  This still-controversial choice turned many off and distracted from the movie itself.  This is a pity because I found Topol's performance astounding and at the core of what I personally consider the strongest and deepest movie musical ever made.At its core, the movie version of Fiddler On The Roof focuses on the story of Anatevka first, using the trials and tribulations of Teyve the milkman and his family saga as a mirror to capture what is happening to the town, and as one of the characters notes to Jewish villages like it all over Russia.  As such, this is the story of the unconquerable faith and basic dignity and humility of Job, extended not just to Teyve, not just to Anatevka, but to all the Russian Jews of that era who were forced to flee the homes they loved.  Jewison captures the core and the essential truths of that unconquerable faith coupled with the overwhelming dignity demonstrated by these survivors continuing to smile and persist in humble faith even as their oppressors try to kick their teeth in.To me, one of the most illustrative exchanges is when Motel (Teyve's eldest son-in-law) reflects, ""We always wait for the Messiah.  Wouldn't this be the perfect time for him to come?""  Sympathetically but bemusedly, the Rabbi replies, ""Of course we shall continue to wait for the Messiah.  We will just have to wait for him somewhere else!"" All at once, the drama, wit, irony, pathos, faith and essential spirit of Teyve's family and the village leave its indelible imprint on our brains.  Jewison not only captures genuinely and unforgettably all the emotions and essential truths of Anatevka and the 3,000-year legacy it embodies, but creates a vital new legacy as its now inseparable companion.  Yet, at the same time that the heartwrenching story of the oppression and exile of the Jews is evoked, and the indomitable spirit that keeps the culture and religion going is reinforced yet again, it is brought forth in a manner that allows non-Jews to share in the emotions and spirit as well.Since I've given such a long review to a movie and story of great length already and have barely touched upon its many specific gems, I'll endeavor to be brief.  Norma Crane, Rosalind Harris, Leonard Frey, Paul Mann, Louis Zorich (later of Brooklyn Bridge), the female actor playing Chava, the ""Greek Chorus of Jewish townspeople"" Zev Schooler, and Molly Picon (the last two being Jewison's concession to the plays Yiddish theater roots) are all outstanding and unforgettable in their roles. The score (yes three good songs were necessarily omitted -- how much longer than 3 hours would you like the movie to run?) is beautifully sung and played, with the instrumentals simply stunning.  The choreography on the Bottle Dance is a standout.  The art direction, sound editing, camera angles, stunning photography, contrasts, virtually every technical aspect of the movie I can name -- and I mean EVERY one -- is magnificently executed to augment Jewison's vision to perfection.[As nothing is 100% perfect, I'll pick two minor nits -- unlike others, I thought Glaser missed the essence of Perchik's scholarly radical by half-an-octave and I thought the beautiful and talented Michele Marsh did not look physically like she belonged in that family.  There I said it.  OK, big deal, they were still more than good enough.]   I generally loathe movies of more than two-and-one-half hours in length. Fiddler On The Roof and A Man For All Seasons are my two most notable exceptions.  If you enjoy movies made before 1980 at all, and have any sense of the essential spirit of mankind and what the human race is about, you owe it to yourself to see this extraordinary opus -- a true masterpiece that only adds to its relevance with the passage of time. 11/10.",Fiddler on the Roof
63,jerekra,"Why Is This FIlm So Good? One Word ""Tradition!""",10,14 February 2009,"Fiddler on the roof is one of the best musicals I have ever seen along with ""The King and I"". Acting, music, and the story all are awesome and lead to this film being so good.Tevre is a great character. Really funny and inciteful and that is great to have as a lead character in a film. Also his wife Golda is the typical nagging wife type who is never at a lack for words. Other great characters are Motel the tailor, Lazer Wolf the butcher, and Perchek the teacher. Also all of Tevres daughters add a lot to the film in a different way. So overall a great cast of characters, one of the best in film history.The songs in this film are classic. You gotta love ""IF I were a rich man"", ""Matchmaker"", ""Sunrise Sunset"", and my personal favorite ""To Life"".THe story works because you can sympathize with the situation the characters are going through. After all it must have been tough on the Jews with all they went through from the Russians and later on the Germans. The way in this film that the Jews are seen being treated makes you feel sorry for them and it is well depicted on screen all of the bad things that they had happen to them.Also the conflict between characters is great. Like how zietel wants to marry Motel despite the fact that it goes against Tradition. And how Chava wants to marry a guy who is not Jewish. SO the conflict between characters is just as good as the conflict that all of the jews are facing in this film.Also there are a lot of funny parts as well. THis film is a pretty funny film at parts like when Tevre thinks Lazer wants to buy his cow but Lazer really wants to marry his daughter. And how Tevre must tell his wife how he gave his daughters permission to marry without consulting her.Great film. Classic. Masterpiece. Entertaining. Recommended.",Fiddler on the Roof
64,frankwiener,An Unsteady Balance,9,7 March 2018,"I am not generally a fan of musicals that have been adapted to the screen, but ""Fiddler on the Roof"" remains as one of the notable exceptions, thanks largely to the genius of director Norman Jewison (""In the Heat of the Night"", ""Moonstruck"", ""The Thomas Crown Affair, ""Jesus Christ Superstar""), the endearing charm, vitality, and humanity of (Chaim) Topol, the ability of the rest of the cast to meet the elevated standard set by the lead, the innovative cinematography of Oswald Morris (""Lolita"", ""Oliver!"", ""The Entertainer"", ""Guns of Navarone"") and the wonderful music, originally written by Jerry Bock and so capably adapted to the screen by John Williams.As to the excellent cast, although there isn't one, single Hollywood ""superstar"" present, this remarkable team nevertheless succeeds in creating one of the best musicals ever adapted to film and a movie that still survives on my list of favorites after many viewings. Personally, I would have loved to see Bea Arthur reprise her Broadway role as Yenta, but that's show business. Jewison's pick of Topol over Zero Mostel, however, was another one of his strokes of brilliance. Although Topol was mostly unknown outside of his native Israel, Jewison made a bold decision to cast him as Tevye, and this was only one example of the director's daring, innovative thinking that enhanced his directing and producing endeavors. He also agreed to cast Norma Crane as the female lead, Golde, who compliments Topol perfectly, even though I don't recall ever seeing her in a film other than her small but critical part as an unkind waitress in ""Tea and Sympathy"" fifteen years earlier. Only Jewison had the ability to see her as ""the perfect match"" for Tevye. Right? Of course right!The story, based on the Yiddish short stories of Sholom Aleichem, is a familiar one for the Jewish people as they steadfastly struggled to hold to their traditions and values in the face of a rapidly changing environment that becomes increasingly hostile to their existence as both a religious and ethnic minority. As bad as conditions were for them during pre-revolutionary Russia and Ukraine, their situation would only worsen, especially when the Germans conquered much of Ukraine, where the story is set, only a few decades later during World War II.The fiddler in the play is a symbol of the perpetually precarious existence of Jews who have often depended upon the kindness of strangers throughout much of their history. Beyond the unique Jewish experience and regardless of our specific faith or ethnicity, the fiddler represents the universal fragility of our lives on this earth. Indeed, the uncertainties of life itself are like...they're like a fiddler on the roof!",Fiddler on the Roof
65,wnterstar,"A touching, wonderful story",9,22 May 2005,"I grew up loving this musical. It's the story of the town of Anatevka as seen through the eyes of Tevye, a milkman. It is touching and funny and somehow real.Topol is a wonderful Tevye and Norma Crane makes Golde his equal. We get to laugh with them, and cry with them. We laugh when Tevye tricks Golde into letting their daughter marry a Tailor instead of the older rich man Golde had in mind. We feel the joy at the wedding, and sadness as the wedding is crashed and ruined.In the end, as the entire Jewish community in Anatevka is told to pack up and move on, you feel sadness they feel at leaving the only home they've know and yet you feel the hope and anticipation of what is to come.I love this movie!",Fiddler on the Roof
66,willrams,You Don't Have to be Jewish!,10,26 December 2002,"No, you don't have to be Jewish to love this musical treat!  I saw this again on TV last night.  The story of a Russian Jewish peasant and the trials and triumphs of his family and friends; the loves of his daughters, and the love of his wife.  The music is superb and the dancing is extra fantastic.  I was once invited to audition for the part of the rabbi of the village; but had already committed to another show.  The oldest daughter, I believe her name is Tzeidel, I met one time when she was in a show called ""Narnia"" at the Santa Maria PCPA Hancock College Theater in 1987.",Fiddler on the Roof
67,faraaj-1,To life and Topol...,10,24 April 2006,"This lovely musical is set in turn of the century Czarist Russia (near Kyiv). The Jewish section of the village is beautifully created (it was actually a Yugoslav village). Look at the houses will shingle roof tops and long chimneys, the emphasis on agriculture and tradesmen.What are the best songs: To Life is probably the best (and shortest unfortunately). There is also If I Were a Rich Man which comes early on in the movie and is actually what hooks you with Topol doing a lovely dance with the dust flying off the balcony. I understand that in various musical performances over the last three decades, Chaim Topol has performed this song hundreds, perhaps thousands of times on stage. All I can say is, it looks fresh and he looks full of vitality when performing it in the movie. It really gives a burst of energy to the movie. I loved Sunrise, Sunset which is a little emotional.Topol gave a superb performance which unfortunately typecast him for the rest of his life. I do think he did more than his fair share of scene stealing though! The actor who played the butcher (Lazar Wolf) was really good as well (especially in To Life and the wedding scene). The middle daughter was really hot!!! I don't think people who don't enjoy musicals should watch this even though the plot is good. But, the songs are an important part of the appeal. I'm a sucker for King and I, Guys and Dolls, My Fair Lady etc. and I see this as the last great musical of that bygone era. Chicago was hit and miss.....",Fiddler on the Roof
68,danielll_rs,"One of the last great musicals, what a pity!",8,4 November 2001,"FIDDLER ON THE ROOF (1971) 9/10SINGIN' IN THE RAIN. MY FAIR LADY. TOP HAT. THE MUSIC MAN. THE SOUND OF MUSIC. AN AMERICAN IN PARIS. THE WIZARD OF OZ. GIGI. WEST SIDE STORY. It's easy to name the classic musicals before 1970, but after... what we have of good... CABARET... ALL THAT JAZZ... HAIR... of course, FIDDLER ON THE ROOF. This may be one of the last great musicals, maybe the last, because all the musicals that came after it were really different from the old ones. Coincidence or not, FIDDLER ON THE ROOF, directed with maestry by Norman Jewison and starring Topol, in a joyous performance as Tevye, is about tradition.FIDDLER is about the fight between the traditional values and the new ones. But it's not just an uplifting story; it's bittersweet, even depressing at times. In fact, I like this film so much because I felt every kind of emotion while watching it: happiness, fun, excitement, sadness... It's a complete film, one that touches you deep inside.The cinematography is gorgeous, the visuals are great and the songs are excellent. I highly recommend this film. It closed the door for the old fashioned musicals, but it was time. Audiences needed something new, but the musical genre isn't a favorite nowadays. I hope that MOULIN ROUGE, the best movie of 2001 so far, opens the door for a new kind of musical.",Fiddler on the Roof
69,steven_torrey,Fiddler on the Roof--2010,8,30 January 2010,"I thought the movie sentimental and treacle. I regret never having seen the original Broadway production with Zero Mostel as Tevye. I give the movie eight stars; the play I give ten stars.San Francisco now has the production on stage at the Golden Gate Theatre from Jan 27 to Feb. with Harvey Fierstein as Tevye, and Susan Cella as Golda; directed by Carole S. Hays. It was an excellent production. The live performance went beyond the sentimentality of the movie. Something is lost in that movie.The audience walks into Golden Gate Theatre, takes a seat, and sees a curtain depicted with a picture of a birch meadow. And immediately the viewer is expected to evoke the word and place ""Birkenau"" which means 'birch meadow.' Birkenau, also known as Auschwitz II.So by this simple aesthetic device, the musical shifts from 1905 Czarist pogroms to prefiguring the future Nazi atrocities. At the end of the play Czarist decree demands that Jews leaves their homeland. In defiance of ""Tradition,"" Chava has eloped with goy--non-Jew--Fyedka and at the end of the play they are on their way to Kracow--a scant 60 miles from Auschwitz. The viewer ends up with hope that as an assimilated Jew in Poland, she could be the one who survives the Nazi maw. At the time she leaves her city of Anatevka for Krakow, she would be about twenty--maybe younger--so in Poland, 1939, she would be a relatively young 59. Survival of ""Tradition"" and life expressed through the marriages, births, dances and ""one season following another laden with happiness and tears."" The fiddler playing in a minor key, a key of mourning, underscores the prefigured tragedy.Sholom Aleichem (1859-1916)--Sholom Rabinovitch--wrote his stories about Jewish life in Czarist Russia of the late 1800s. Marc Chagall--1887-1985--evoked Jewish life in a Russian long gone with the Bolshevik revolution--but an evocation of Russian Jewish life, non-the-less. This San Francisco production very much used Chagall inspired scenery. While Hollywood no doubt used Chagall inspired scenery, the techno-mechno of Hollywood dilutes the impact; an impact that gets underlined, emphasized in a live theatrical performance.The very techno-mechno Hollywood reduces the impact; understatement is not the way of Hollywood. The 1940s noir-drama succeeded because of this understatement. The Hollywood musical relies, requires over the top and consequently something is lost. The live Stage Production can do something that escapes Hollywood and the San Francisco live performance produced excellence in their interpretation of Fiddler on the Roof.",Fiddler on the Roof
70,mandagrammy,A True Classic,10,15 August 2020,"Among the great musical films, this is one of the best. It includes unforgettable music along with a truly interesting story line, which is rooted in real history. I watched it when it first came out, and just recently saw it for the second time. It has stood the test of time beautifully. And I can still sing along with many of the musical numbers even after all these years. That tells you something right there. Although it is long enough to require an intermission, it moves along so rapidly that you'll never notice the time. Two thumbs sky high for this one.",Fiddler on the Roof
71,rawiri42,Great film,8,11 October 2014,"After 43 years, I eventually got to see Fiddler on the Roof and it was well worth the wait! What a touching, beautiful portrayal of life in an exiled Jewish community in Russia (or was it the Ukraine?) around the turn of the 20th century. The star of the film is undoubtedly Topol as Tevye a subsistence milkman, the head of his family of wife and five daughters but there were certainly many others. His wife, Golde (Norma Crane - who died just two years after ""Fiddler"" of breast cancer) and his three oldest daughters Yente (Molly Picon), Hodel (Michele Marsh) and Tzeitel (Rosalind Harris) captured the modest yet determined characters of male-dominated Jewish women at a time when traditions (a word yelled by Tevye many times in exasperation throughout the movie) were irreversibly changing. As we learn during the story, Tevye and Golda first met each other on their wedding day and were told that, in time, they would learn to love each other. The scene where they actually admit this is absolutely beautiful.However, starting with Yente, Tevye and Golda's daughters rebel against century-old tradition and choose their own marriage partners - even though old ways don't die easily and, being the soft-hearted, loving father that he is, Tevye succumbs to their wishes until Tzeitel announces her love for a gentile and that is just too much for her father who (initially) disowns her.One amusing (to me) scene was where Hodel and her man, Perchic (played by Paul Michael Glaser of Starsky and Hutch fame) express their love for each other. As I watched the scene I was frequently reminded of Sheldon and Amy of TV's Big Bang Theory. (I guess you need to watch both to see it but it did make me smile!)I won't write about the ending to the movie as that would tend to be a spoiler too far. Just let me say Fiddler on the Roof is a very believable story of love, loyalty and sheer doggedness that is an inspiration to anyone who is experiencing difficult times. As I say, well worth the long wait!",Fiddler on the Roof

(1965) **Possible spoilers ahead**""Fiddler on the Roof"" is about a Jewish family who is being forced out of their homes via Hitler. I am not Jewish, but that's not why I don't like this movie. I just don't think the singing and dancing are that entertaining. The story is a bit weak, too. One of Tevye's daughters is converted to Christianity, and he denounces her for it. Being a Christian myself, I object to that.If you must see this movie, skip the ""Miracle of Miracles"" song. It's more than unbearable. This movie is among my bottom ten movies.My Score: 0.5/10.",Fiddler on the Roof
73,LilyDaleLady,"Third-rate ""Fiddler""",3,5 February 2006,"If you have never seen this on stage, or heard the justifiably famous original Broadway cast album (with the legendary Zero Mostel as Tevye), then maybe this will pass muster. The cast is generally good, it's realistically filmed on location (or close enough) in Yugoslavia, etc. However, there is something really lackluster in the whole production.The big disappointment is Israeli actor Topol as Tevye. He's younger and handsomer than Mostel, but doesn't sing or ""emote"" nearly as well, and he has one of those rather odd Israeli accents that are partly British -- certainly NOT Russian -- and that comes off as awkward. Tevye is the prime role, he has the major songs, like ""Tradition"" and ""If I Were A Rich Man"", so having a so-so leading man here is fatal to the film. He's also too old to play Tevye on screen -- on the stage, it's OK to have an older actor, but Tevye's oldest daughter is 18 and he was supposedly married at 18 himself, so realistically he is supposed to be about 37. Instead, Topol appears 50 or more with gray hair. (This is also true for the actress who plays his wife.)The larger flaw of the film is that like a lot of other musicals (the recent ""Rent"" comes to mind), the film director felt that it had to made on location and as realistically as possible. This just doesn't work well for most musicals, which are intended for the more stylized presentation of a stage and a theater. Forced to look at Tevye's actual barn and animals is very distracting. Plus, with the action staged out of doors, the singing (which is obviously done in a studio) sounds absurd -- where's the echo chamber? LOL!Despite everything looking ""real"" in the physical sense, the art direction has gone way overboard in the sense that all the peasants are depicted as living far too grandly for Jews of that time and place. Tevye's house is a multi-story Ralph Lauren summer home, and sits on many acres of land -- in those days, he would have REALLY been a rich man if he had all that. When Tevye sings about being rich and owning chicken, I believe its meant to imply that he's too poor to actually own any -- not an excuse to cut to photography of his flock!That being said, if you like the music and general story, it's all here, and reasonably faithful to the theatrical production in terms of plot, resolution, etc. Since there is no bringing back Zero Mostel, this is what we have! and probably a bit better than the typical community theater productions that still are around.In conclusion, I see a lot of reviewers talk about the sadness of the ending, as the Jews are forced to leave Anatevka. Personally, I have never considered this as sad. The film distorts things a bit by depicting Tevye as a landowner with lots of farm animals, furniture, a house, etc. In reality, peasants this poor had virtually nothing. The reality -- as experienced by my own paternal grandmother, who left Russia in 1920 -- is that these Russian Jews came to America to lead vastly better lives in a free country. Not to mention that their children and grandchildren became successful doctors, lawyers, business owners. This is not a sad ending, folks -- it's the happiest ending of all time!",Fiddler on the Roof
74,Ed-from-HI,Truly Magical musical presenting A 'Lost' World of Joy & Sorrow + Tradition.....that Lives On in this Great & moving film Musical!,10,31 August 2019,"There is something uniquely special (and even authentically magical) about this particular Musical, ""Fiddler on the Roof"" and especially the Film directed by Norman Jewison, starring Chaim Topol = playing Tevye, the milkman, and head of Family, keeper of 'Tradition' remembering + appreciating (thru emotionally resonant Song & dance) the massive Joy and unbearable hardship, resourcefully 'surviving' by maximizing tightly enduring family bonds (and resilient 'faith') within the confines of a typical Jewish community 'shtetl' common to eastern-Europe of the 19th Century (and prior).This film paints a heartbreakingly poignant picture of an impoverished, materially poor, but culturally & spiritually very Rich community (in the Russian/Eastern European Shtetls of the Late 19th/very early 20th Century). A typical 'pale-of-settlement' town also Rich in familial bonds, cemented and secured thru Centuries of spiritual belief honoring respected cultural 'Traditions'!This movie does an amazing job of authentically capturing this 'long-Lost' way of Life (in this particular case Jewish) but the transcendent artistic power of ""Fiddler"" is that it seems to represent a 'Universal' story of all our immigrant origins = a Way of Life, I think, very common to most humans, prior to our modern 20th/21st Century technological age. When family & faith was literally all there was to hang onto, daily existence being acutely fragile and uncertain. Mere survival reflecting that proverbial flickering 'candle in the wind' somehow persevering thru intermittent heavy showers & snowstorms.... still finding abundant Joy and significant meaning thru beleaguered everyday struggles.Anyway, not many Films have been able to capture both the fragility/ apprehension/ intense struggle to just survive => contrasted against the countervailing feelings of ecstatic Joy and strong-sense of Belonging & connection to Community.The saddest part, of the broader/ Later Story (for Jewish families, like these), was the terrible Fate awaiting the 'traditionalists' living in All those East European Shtetls (i.e. physical destruction & Death by hands of German Third Reich => or subsequent Soviet 're-education' => with departure/emigration for those fortunate few remaining). In any case, as ""Fiddler"" espouses a once very Rich & thriving 'World' that no longer fully exists in Reality but does Live on through the magic of Film & Song! (and many Books, of course).Interesting note: favorite film composer John Williams, did this marvelous Score adaptation (originally composed by Jerry Bock & Sheldon Harnick for Broadway) - he also did the incredible original Score for ""Schindler's List"" => And, of course, Isaac Stern was the genuine 'Fiddler'!",Fiddler on the Roof

Although it came out the year I was born, i saw it for the first time when i was about 5 and even though i was too young to understand a lot of it, i felt a connection with the story, the characters and exspecialy the music. As I got older the movie just kept getting better and i never tired, and still don't, of this masterpiece of cinema. This is not just a ""Jewish"" movie, everyone can identify the story and love it. ""Topol"" as the poor milkman with five daughters, embodies the part to perfection. He has not only the singing chops but the demeanor and quick wit of the character. The other cast members are fantastic as well, ex specially ""Leonard Frye"" as Motel the tailor. Oh and what music! I dare anybody to watch this movie and not walk away from it humming at least a few of the tunes. My personal favorites are ""If i were a rich man"" and ""Sunrise and Sunset"". Movie musicals of recent years have been hit and miss. For example ""Chicago"" was great but ""Mama Mia"" was schlock, pure and simple. ""Fiddler"" is legendary! See it!",Fiddler on the Roof

The results are somewhat unsatisfying, and the film lacks the spark, excitement and fun of its stage counterpart. It's as if all involved treated the material like the Dead Sea Scrolls, instead of musical comedy. ""Fiddler On The Roof"", does contain some fine performances, and almost all of the original stage score is intact (beautifully orchestrated by John Williams). The serious moments work well, but with a running time of about 181 minutes, which flies by on stage, 'Fiddler' on film, merely plods along, and never matches the stage experience. If you are a fan on musicals, I would still recommend seeing it. It's just a shame that, like so many filmed versions of Broadway hits, this one never quite succeeds.",Fiddler on the Roof
78,Lee-107,Unforgettable piece of Great Film-making!!,9,28 August 2002,"To sum up a critical appreciation of this film in however long or short a review is close to impossible. It's one of those films that cinema was created for. Indeed, its depth of content and characterisation, its sincere effort at chronicling Jewish life with music and humor are all aspects that have each contributed in their own way to the enrichment of cinema as a whole. When it was performed as a play, I am sure it did the same for theatre. That said, this film is special to me because of my sense of identification with the three daughters, especially Chava. Since, I myself happen to be the youngest of three sisters, I know from experience the friction caused between daughters and fathers because of differences over issues like marriage and free-will. I even come from a culture that assumes ""Tradition"" to be of paramount importance, before everything else... I felt deeply for what Tzeitel, Hodel and Chava felt in the film and at the same time, I knew well the predicament that Reb Tevye was in. His discussions with his self, his eventual acquiescence to their marriages was both humorous and heart-warming. Topol's rendering of Reb Tevye was amazing! He seemed absolutely natural and convincing in the part.
Part of the success of this film(apart from the music), is definitely because of the way that era in Soviet history has been recreated - from the sleepy little village where our protagonists live(their costumes and occupations) to the towns where signs of unrest and revolution were more conspicuous. Everything has been very convincingly portrayed. The turn of events in this film is akin to those in 'The Sound of Music'. A good part of both films goes in songs, courtship and family interactions and then things take a turn, the drama reaches a climax or a crescendo. In 'SoM' it is because of World War II and here it is because of the Russian Revolution.
Needless to say, but the music is this film's trump card. It is what adds realism and that all-important element of authenticity. I doubt if the beauty and the little nuances of Jewish life have been more aptly portrayed in any other feature better than they are over here. I enjoyed all the songs - the one that Hodel(Michelle Marsh) sings before leaving Tevye to find Perchik in Siberia is especially beautiful. My only small grouse is that they didn't have enough of the fiddler and his music. The tune he plays is so good, more of it would have been perfect!Still, 'Fiddler on the Roof' is an unforgettable gem of a film - the best that ever was made!",Fiddler on the Roof

The legendary Broadway show with Zero Mostel was a joy to behold--beautiful, heartbreaking, extremely funny, and at its beating heart was an actor so sublime, so comedic, wise, brilliant and riveting, that the audience was swept away. This was captured to some extent on the legendary Broadway Album--listen to how his voice jumps octaves as he expresses the emotions of a song, how he growls, how he soars, how his timing is absolutely impeccable. What in the world were the people who made this film thinking? What could have been a classic film performance: like Yul Brynner in ""The King and I' or Rex Harrison in ""My Fair Lady"" instead loses its very soul. The film version is OK--with the setting and the music by and large intact--but where is that dynamic core--the very reason to see ""Fiddler on the Roof""? Where is Zero Mostel?

Doesn't exactly sound like material for a musical, but that's what makes ""Fiddler"" so amazing. From the colorful, joyous opening number ""Tradition"", to the last lonely strains from the title instrument, and everything in between, this film is a flawless exercise in energy, mood, and pace that cannot and will not be outdone.",Fiddler on the Roof

82,eplromeo8,Fiddler on the Roof on Reel 13,5,14 November 2008,"FIDDLER ON THE ROOF has been a beloved musical for decades and the movie, which aired this past Saturday on Reel 13, was enormously successful when it first came out in 1971. I, however, have never been interested in the show. Though I do like some of the more famous songs (""Matchmaker"" is catchy, ""If I Were a Rich Man"" is universally appealing and ""Sunrise, Sunset"" is beautifully written), I have always found the overall show to be pretty dull and very frustrating in terms of its repetitive nature.Director Norman Jewison (who also directed last week's THE RUSSIANS ARE COMING, THE RUSSIANS ARE COMING) did manage to do some interesting things in his adaptation, however. I liked how, on several occasions, he opted out of having characters sing out on screen. Instead, he used their voices non-diegetically, as if they were thinking the song in their heads. Even though the song itself is incredibly annoying, he turned the ""Tradition"" number into an effective montage introducing us to life in Anatevka. I also liked how Jewison handled the iconography of the fiddler itself. In the show, it's a bit heavy handed, but Jewison shoots it just right, keeping the fiddler mostly in background or shadow and cutting to him infrequently enough that he is an effective symbol for their way of life  subtle enough while maintaining its accessibility. To be honest, I wasn't a big fan of the talking to the camera device (has any film been able to pull this off except for FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF?). Additionally, Jewison employed the zoom lens several times throughout the film, a common tactic in the late 60's/early 70's, but it felt out of place in a period piece such as this.I was surprised at how weak many of the performances were  much of the cast had an air of theatricality about them, as if they were plucked right off the stage and never got accustomed to screen acting. The mother and the eldest daughter (a dead ringer for Barbra Streisand) are two exceptions. The primary exception, of course, is Topol as Tevye. Tevye is one of the most iconic characters is musical history  the male equivalent of Mama Rose  and Topol knocks it out of the park. He is funny, charmingly foolish, boisterous without being obnoxious, extremely caring and tender with a booming, powerful (singing and speaking) voice that perfectly fits this larger-than-life character. It ranks as one of the all-time best movie musical performances.In spite of all these positive qualities, FIDDLER the film still doesn't seem to overcome the flaws of FIDDLER the play. The second act is mostly strong with many emotionally impactful moments, but the build-up to get there is way too long and too slow. Several scenes in the film drag on mercilessly and some seem superfluous altogether (I don't think we needed the ""Wonder of Wonders"" number, for example). I imagine that Jewison and his team felt some pressure to include everything so the stage fans wouldn't be disappointed, but their priority in adapting the musical has to be to the film itself. When it's transferred to celluloid, it's a new animal and there are a different set of rules. More than anything, what FIDDLER really needed before relocating from Broadway was a good diet  to trim all the fat.(For more information on this or any other Reel 13, check out their website at www.reel13.org)",Fiddler on the Roof
83,LG72387,A beautiful masterpiece,8,20 June 2002,"Fiddler on the Roof is a moving musical about a Jewish milkman trying to cope with his daughters deciding to break the tradition of his ancestors. The film illustrates a brilliant combination of John William's lavish adaptation of the famous songs (i.e. ""Sunrise, Sunset"" and ""If I Were a Rich Man"") and Topol's outstanding performance as Reb Tevye, the film is a dazzling and spectacular telling of the harships of a Jewish family living in Russia during the Russian Revolution. However, the only thing that brings this film down is the fact is that they sway away from some of the smaller scenes that were in the original story. Director Norman Jewison has deprived some of the actors to display their talents more frequently and in fact, even cut out a song entitled ""The Rumor"". In spite of this, the film is filled with laughable comedy and terrific music and was able to garner 3 Academy Awards in the year 1971. I recommend this to anyone whom while watching forgets that the film is in fact three hours long.",Fiddler on the Roof
84,AnimagusGirl,one of the few Jewish musicals in America that are popular,8,5 November 2002,"This movie was good. I loved all the songs and it was a perfect cast. I particularly liked Topol's portrayal of Tevye. Excellent. Also there are not so many Jewish/Yiddish musicals (or plays or movies or TV shows that I know of) as there could be here in America. I for one am Jewish, and my friends are not Jewish, and they saw it and loved it as well. My point is this: You don't have to be Jewish to like this movie...you can be a very religious Catholic and still like this movie. When I say Catholic, I mean everyone. This really should be more popular. A stellar performance from Topol. You could tell alot about Tevye from him. I loved the songs. :)",Fiddler on the Roof

86,kastellos,Greatest musical ever,10,19 August 2004,"This is simply the greatest musical ever. While the music of some of the great musicals of the 1930's (several of the Astaire/Rodgers, Eddy/MacDonald, etc. films) is equally great or greater, the story line of Fiddler is exceptional. It says more about tradition, bending of tradition, family, husband-wife relationships, father-daughter relationships, the relationships of the powerful to the weaker, intolerance, etc., than most any other movie.If you don't laugh at Tevye's conversations with God or cry when he is so torn between his love for his daughter (who marries a Christian) and his own tradition, then you must be comatose. Although some may have been disappointed that Mostel did not get the role, I feel quite the opposite. Whereas Zero would have been equally great in the comic parts, he could not have carried out the pathos as Topol did.There will not be another musical such as this in our lifetime.",Fiddler on the Roof
87,bobsteimle,"More than a classic, it's a way of life",10,8 July 2005,"Topol plays Tevye in one of the greatest acting performances of our time. His continual praying monologue throughout the film is a perfect depiction of a devout religious man. Though raised to strictly follow traditions, he bends a little to allow the happiness of his children. Yet he doesn't bend enough to violate his religious obligation. He can accept the trends of change in society, but he will not deny his fundamental beliefs. Though he could bear the sadness of poverty or exile to Siberia, he cannot endure the loss of religious belief, and he counts his daughter as dead to him when she marries a catholic. Because of the great acting in this version of the movie, the emotions are real, and the great music helps bring that emotion out. This movie shows the sadness and the happiness of life. It's a real-life experience that I've enjoyed watching over and over again.",Fiddler on the Roof

Such fantastic humor that I wasn't expecting. Felt I was laughing out loud fairly regularly. Topol in the main role is perfect. This character may be the most likable I have come across in all the movies I've seen. I know this is one I am going to want to watch over and over again. Already one of my favorite movies I've ever seen, why I gave it 10/10.",Fiddler on the Roof
89,myschrec,Laughter and tears,10,31 July 2003,"Based on the stories of Scholem Aleichem, this musical describes life in a Jewish shtetl in the Ukraine(?) around 1900 (?).  It is filled with the joy of living a simple life -- an Orthodox Jewish life -- where the most important religious events are (not centered around the synagogue, but) centered around the home and life cycle events:  birth, marriage, and (most important) the Sabbath.  This movie distills the essence of Eastern European Judaism.  Interestingly, the stories were written before Hitler almost completely wiped out Eastern European Jewry --- which adds to the nostalgia of the piece.  But Hitler failed in one respect:  many Eastern European Jews succeeded in transplanting themselves to the US, where, in spite of overt antisemitism, they and their Judaism flourished because of our wonderful US Constitution and an American spirit that fostered individualism and rewarded hard work.  So it is not surprising that Americans Jerry Bock and Sheldon Harnick created this homage to Scholem Aleichem and the Eastern European Jews Hitler tried to destroy.  Many of the songs in this musical are now part of an American culture that is (now) willing to accept Yiddish phrases and Jewish concepts.  Now, everyone knows that ""L'Chayim"" means ""To Life.""  All young girls can identify with ... and laughingly reject ... ""Matchmaker, Matchmaker.""  Every American that has had to work hard every day enjoys singing ""If I Were a Rich Man.""    And songs like ""Sabbath prayer"" and ""Sunrise, Sunset"" have become staples of Jewish liturgy as well as songs with which every parent can identify.  My favorite song is ""Far from the Home I Love.""   
Could this film have been any better?  Perhaps.  If you have not heard it, you must listen to the audio recording of the 1964 Original Broadway Cast of Fiddler on the Roof (from RCA), which has Zero Mostel (singing the part of Tevye) as well as Julia Migenes, Bert Convy, and Beatrice Arthur.  I would have loved to see Zero Mostel in the movie, but Topol does an excellent job. Final note:  my mother was born in, grew up in, and emigrated from a small town in the Ukraine.  Her father had died there.  She had several older brothers who did not emigrate and were completely lost by 1945.  The memories must have been terribly painful for her because she vehemently refused to speak of them.  But she was must have been deeply affected by her childhood -- because she was a hard-working and dedicated mother -- willing to sacrifice her self in order to give her children the best possible future.  She was even willing to sacrifice some of the sacred Jewish traditions -- in order to assure that her family survives and thrives.  And that is just one of the movie's themes.  Another theme:  in the midst of pain and loss, there can still be hope.",Fiddler on the Roof
90,rigoletto339,Still great after all these years,10,31 May 2018,"I saw it last night in our local theater that shows ""classic"" movies. It's everything the other reviewers say: funny, poignant, sad, happy, philosophical.... Tevye has a running conversation with God (""Sometimes I think, when it gets too quiet up there, You say to Yourself, ""What kind of mischief can I play on My friend Tevye?"")Topol has played that role so often that it fits him like a velvet glove. It's long, with an intermission (""Entre'acte"" on the screen), but never dull or lagging.The music was conducted and adapted by a young and upcoming film musician named John Williams.Part of Tevye's story is how Tradition keeps their society intact, and how it keeps them stuck in the same roles year after year, and what happens when a younger generation breaks out of that tradition.I'd say that this is one you need to see on the big screen - but with today's giant home screens, that's not true any more.

It all fits.",Fiddler on the Roof
92,Minstrelman,An unchanging man in changing times,10,25 January 2000,"Although a musical, Fiddler is not just another ""cutesy"" musical.  It is an in depth look at a man dealing with his traditions in changing times in pre-Communist Russia where he is persecuted as a Jew.  Others in the story are also dealing with duty and expectations while trying to deal with the changes around them. The musical format unfortunately has had a bad rap in recent years, but it helps to make the story less harsh and more palatable. In the end, Fiddler leaves viewers, who take the time to listen and watch, asking questions about themselves, such as their own ability to be tolerant of others and their ability to hold on to their identity in the midst of chaos.

I found myself humming along to the repeated song Tradition while watching it, and along with other superb songs shows a dramatic, yet also comedic side to this musical. Indeed, despite all the comedic asides by Topol, and the happiness of many scenes, there is also a vivid display of the plight of the Russian Jewish population of the time this movie is set, adding a darker tone, although not one that in any way damages the film, as light and dark sit well with each other. All the musical performances are top notch, particularly that of Topol as Tevye, a role he fits so well and manages to bring alive.An intriguing plot shapes this movie, helping to elevate it above ""just another musical"" along with the aforementioned performances.

The first thing that comes to my mind whenever I think about this movie is the little dance Topol does while singing If I was a Rich Man. And I remember how I almost wished for a match maker when I was younger. And seeing how even though I'm now older and still single a match maker still at times doesn't seem like a bad idea. It shows events that could have really happened and it just tugs at your heart. A movie that can make you react to it like you are watching it for the very first time each time is a movie worth watching. And that is what this movie does to me. It deals with events that many people don't want to deal with but went on and it shows how some people may have dealt with it.

The film crew was denied permission because the story of Tevye is unsympathetic to the Russian people. The film hints at anti-Semitism in Russia. One of its themes is that many family members have left Russia and immigrated to America. It also hints about the upcoming Russian Revolution, as well as the Holocaust. As a result, the film had to be mostly filmed in Croatia. Several indoor scenes, such as the dream sequence, were filmed in England. It also is interesting that Mr. Jewisson is a non-Jew himself despite his name. Several songs from the movie soundtrack were performed in a different order than from the Broadway production. The film also got several Oscar nominations that year but faced tough competition, such as ""French Connection"".",Fiddler on the Roof

100,pizzazzman2000,Breaking free from cultural dogmas,9,10 July 2009,"We could count the years on our fingertips and realise that even only 38 years ago, we, the masses were oblivious to the beliefs, customs, and the like of the Jews. True, our knowledge of them goes back to the Old testament, and Christ, and Jews, but this musical pulls our minds out of the quagmire that holds them down, and relights our minds to see what we should have understood a long time ago. Anyone with a ""limited-understanding"" mind would have been given a solid jolt and wakening in a New York minute.Truly this movie is worth more than its salt, brought to it by the 3 Oscars added graciously to its portfolio.For starters, the feeling of antisemitism that prevailed against the Jews in Russia at the dawn of the 20th Cenntury. Here we have Tevye spelling out for us the strict orthodox values which we non-Jews are possibly, or were not possibly, aware of. The ""matchmaker"" concept gives birth to a strong turning point, early on in this film, for the concept of ""love"" affairs had not even seen the light of day in the Jewish universe. And the Jews themselves could not comprehend a marriage not arranged by the parents. We see that this sleaze is given a solid blow in this film, when 3 love marriages take place.And with each marriage of the daughters of Tevye, we see the binding chains of the orthodox beliefs surrounding the Jews, given more weakening blows which eventually break them completely.Breaking away from the dogmatic society. We see three daughters of Tevye burn it into their minds that only true love, as opposed to the choices of the matchmaker/parents, can really bring happiness on its wings - wings which could also signal hardship, ostracism from the family. Crucial elements that helped reshape our idea/ignorance about the Jews. Elements that were worth the bargain with sacrificing your beliefs/dogmas for a more liberal practical approach.This success, won by this film, flies against the flow of Jewish conventionalism. This is one comedy romantic flick which nicely plays up the dogmatic side of the Jewish conventions, and simultaneously juxtaposes it with the practical side of the Christian beliefs, and shows determination at breaking out of that shell of thought.A truly touching film for all to see.",Fiddler on the Roof

102,hypathio7,Tevye's Daughters Question Traditions,10,29 November 2014,"TRADITION! Well actually the movie is about changing, bending, breaking traditions. The Fiddler on the roof as described by Tevye in the opening of the movie is symbolic for existentialism. It is a metaphor for the challenge of balancing your life and knowing your place in the world. Traditional religious rituals and customs give the community where Tevye's family lives the supposed comfort to get through the balancing act. However, Tevye's three oldest daughters challenge tradition in their romantic lives and the ""outside"" world is entering into a time a extreme turmoil. The ways of the older generation clash with those of the younger generation. And through it all Tevye is really pretty progressive for a man in his society.The story is serious and humorous. The film is shot beautifully. The songs are great, some more catchy than others. Tevye's constant dialog with his ""best friend,"" God is thought provoking and often funny.Since it is based on the book Tevye's Daughters, it is appropriate that his daughter's romantic awakenings be the main concern of the plot. The oldest daughter challenges tradition a little by pledging her love to a man of her choice, but he is a (soft-spoken) tailor from the same village and they still have a customary wedding. The middle daughter bends tradition by falling for a progressive teacher and budding revolutionary. I love that in the existential crisis he claims humankind must take much more responsibility for balancing on the roof and that traditions are not going to keep us safe up there. The youngest of the three daughters of marrying age meets another intelligent reader, but he is a Russian Kazakh and Christian. This is breaking the tradition entirely by having a marriage of two faiths. It is because the relationships of the three daughters and the father-daughter relationships are so well rendered that this story is more than a Jewish story.",Fiddler on the Roof

It has great vitality, though of a different kind than one would experience with a musical such as Oklahoma! or Singing in the Rain.  The memorable songs don't have the flair of Rodgers & Hammerstein or Cole Porter, but they have deep meaning and evoke poignant reminders of both the wonderful traditions of the old world and the hateful, destructive behavior of man.  Favorite numbers include ""If I Were a Rich Man"" and ""Sunrise, Sunset,"" but the emotive ""Do You Love Me?"" and the wistful ""Matchmaker"" are great songs as well.Chaim Topol's big screen reprise of Tevye (Topol played him in London, but the character was played on Broadway by the great Zero Mostel) is superlative.

Unique devices to call our attention to the father, trying to keep up traditions in a changing world, ""--on the other hand!"" with camera perspectives suddenly changed were excellent. However, with a home theater system, no doubt you will be disappointed in the laser disks and VHS versions!  Why?  Because often their 'stereophonic' channels were quite crippled with phasing problems.  That is, some mics or mixers used in the final mix-downs were themselves out of phase. What this does is to destroy the 'stereo acoustical immaging of LEFT RIGHT CENTER BASS AND REAR channels.  We noticed this at a radio station when we first got the PHONOGRAPH & TAPE CASSETTE versions.  A terrible shame.  I've not listened and watched the DVD version, but unless MGM/UA technicians have not discovered this and corrected it, the problem continues.

There isn't any distractions etc. So you get enveloped into it like you are there and part of it. It is a lot harder to do that with watching a video of it at home. Also I wouldn't say this is a comedy. It is a musical drama. And I give it 10 out of 10. I own the video, & bought it as soon as it became available. Prior to purchasing it, I watched it every time it came on TV. It is a brilliant production, the set is well done, showing a poor tired village who is regularly being harassed by their non-Jewish counterparts in Czarist Russia.

Much the same as The Sound of Music, I had no idea this Film had such a dark Storyline and it's rare to see a Movie breaking the Hollywood Mold for a ""Happy Ending"". Chaim Topol's acting of this Character had the perfect balance between being a Strong Mans Man and the humour of always doing as he pleases but at the same time backing down to his Wife.

108,biznest,"Enjoyable, but be prepared for its slowness",5,25 March 2003,"The plot of this movie is told very well without one lyric or note, and so while the songs are all great, they slow down the plot and rhythm of interest. I grew up around community theater so it is still enjoyable for me, but for the average viewer it may induce sleep. Try to stick with it, though, as it gets really better halfway through.The best musicals carry on the plot for you during at least some of the songs if not all. Fiddler does have a handful of songs that add info, but since there are SEVERAL numbers, I yearned for either less of them or for them to tell me more. It does move the plot along with enough songs to still be a good, if bulky, musical.A good number is after Tevye discovers that his eldest daughter and the tailor pledged their love a year prior, and he's struck a deal for her with the butcher. That number was perfect. Next, though the number in the woods between the two lovebirds was nice and gave them a performance, but I got up and did something else, it bored me.Also, in the beginning, Tevye's barn number, while long, explains his love for knowledge. And the clothesline number with the daughters was pleasant and showed me how they all really felt about getting a match. And, the dream scene where Tevye explains to Golde about why the tailor should get Tzeitel instead of the butcher: this is IMO the best example in Fiddler of how the plot is enhanced by a musical number. ""Sunrise, Sunset"", Tzeitel's wedding, was my most favorite number. I loved the dance part.Those are some examples. In exchange for your perseverance, you will see excellent performances from everyone. A very young Paul Michael Glaser is really good and he amazed me, since all I knew of him was Starsky & Hutch.The serious subplot of Jewish persecution is also intriguing.

But is not only a history of a single family in a single village, is the history of the Jewish people. Show you the ideology of the classic Jews, how was changing his minds, how they lived and coexist (and not) with the non Jewish people (they belonged to the Orthodox Church). And finally, how they had to go, how they were expelled from there land.And the characters are charming to. Tevye, Who nobody obeys him, and he seems dominated for his wife, Golde. The daughters of Tevy symbolize the changes, the first got married with no matchmaker, and was hard to admit. The second with a crazy Marxist Jew, who fought against the classical values and tradition. And the younger, Chava, with a Non Jew. That was terrible for Tevye, he couldn't admit that.

I remember seeing it at my grandparents' house when I was not yet three. My father said when my grandmother saw the play, she was moved to tears. With the movie, she only had one standard complaint - no Zero Mostel. I can see now what she meant. Don't get me wrong, Topol is great as Tevye, but I can hardly imagine what Zero Mostel must've brought to the role. Besides that one small thing, I am also in love with Fiddler. How many young people even know what a shtetl is nowadays? Probably not many. And the sad truth is, unlike many other European immigrants who can go back to explore the villages of their ancestors, Jews cannot. Of course, Fiddler is heavily romanticized, but it gives us a small picture of the ""old country"". Without this movie, the idea of the shtetl might've been lost to future generations. The fact that it was superbly directed (by aptly named Norman Jewison - who by the way wasn't Jewish), acted, choreographed, and adapted to the screen, is just non-dairy icing on the cake.",Fiddler on the Roof
111,awarix,What a great movie,7,20 June 2007,"Fiddler on the Roof is so fun! A big milkman who's continually bursting into song or dance, girls wanting to get married, but not wanting to have a match made, a small town community with no problems suddenly bombarded with the outside world, Russians, Jews, cows, horses, song, dance, more song, more dance, the cool guy from starsky and hutch...the list goes on and on. I love this movie, and if you like musicals (or even if you don't!), you'll probably feel the same way about it. It's such a good movie, showing seriousness, comedy, romance, and even thriller. (When Motel and Tseitel are running through the woods singing ""Miracle of Miracles"", that's pretty thrilling!) You'll love this movie.",Fiddler on the Roof
112,ephuycke,Song to a Changing World,8,31 October 2020,"Norman Jewison's adaptation of the Broadway musical by Arnold Perl and Joseph Stein (itself an adaptation of stories by Sholom Aleichem) was released at a pivotal moment of painful change for the genre of the Hollywood musical. It was clear from the high-profile failures of films like ""Hello, Dolly!"" and ""Doctor Doolittle"" that both audiences and critics were no longer interested in the roadshow spectacular that had fueled so many of the industry's biggest successes from the early fifties through to the late sixties. Now films like ""Easy Rider"" and ""Bonnie and Clyde"" were bringing in box office and awards recognition, auguring an era of grittier, more character-driven films made by a new breed of younger auteurs like Scorsese, De Palma, Altman, and Coppola. If there is a guiding principle to the 1970's in American cinema, it was an investigation into the subjectivity of the form to tell internal stories about dynamic characters. Could the musical survive in such a climate, or would it limp on through the next decade as an invisible dinosaur until the auteur era ended in the early 80's?I wasn't sure what to make of this film before watching it. I'd been aware of it for many years and had bleary half-memories of a live production I'd seen at the Smithsonian in much rowdier years. I'd always imagined it as a film that came out in the mid-sixties, not the early seventies, partly because of the jaunty catchiness of the most famous song, ""Tradition."" To my surprise, ""Fiddler"" was released the same year as ""A Clockwork Orange"" and ""The French Connection."" But once I actually watched the film, it began to fit in more and more with its era.The stakes of the film are ultimately internal. The arc that the main character Tevye travels (played by Chaim Topol with joviality, devotion, and a wry humor that nurses deep gulfs of anger and pain) shows him going from a man who swears by and relies upon the thousands of years of social, interpersonal, familial, and religious tradition, to a man who must discover a new flexibility to his beliefs. Jewison takes advantage of the inherently meta elements of the musical to give us scenes where he debates with himself and with God questions that challenge his identity as a father and his identity as a Jew.Jewison was wise to strip the original production of its overtly comedic tone. This is not to say that the humor is entirely removed, because to do so would be to deny so much of the characters' inherent resilience: irony and wit are their main defense against the harsh realities of being Jewish in the 1900's in Russia. Consider a scene toward the end when Tevye and the other village leaders are informed by a local goyim policeman that they must leave Anatevka, where many of them have lived their entire lives. The policeman leaves, the elders regard each other quietly until someone comes to the wry conclusion that, Well it was never that nice there to begin with.But the film never lets us off the hook the same way that the staged musical did. The pogroms and poverty are shown with stark realism, but the humor of the Jewish characters creates a deeply human tension that makes the film all the more potent and affecting.So many of the aforementioned Hollywood musicals of the fifties and sixties were content to simply provide lavish and spectacular experiences that audiences would not be able to get at home on the burgeoning television landscape. They were films shot in exotic locations or in extravagant sets where scores of highly trained dancers and musicians plied their trade in beautiful costumes. The comparison has already been made to that these were the antecedent to today's superhero film, but a growing cynicism due to the turmoil of the sixties left audiences with an appetite for something more real, something that they could see some of themselves in, that didn't just exist to distract them from the world outside the theater.""Fiddler on the Roof"" came out a year before Bob Fosse's ""Cabaret,"" and together, these two musicals created a space for the classic genre to feasibly exist within this new audience expectation for complex character and subjective storytelling. They proved that the genre could be used in unique ways to plumb the depths of psychological experience with the same innovation as the other standards of American seventies cinema, because beneath the bold costumes, complex choreography, and catchy music, they were both about real human beings struggling to hold onto their sense of identity in a world chaotic with change.",Fiddler on the Roof
113,mnlauer,Excellent Film,9,5 May 2002,"I found Fiddler on the Roof to be an excellent, entertaining film.I like broadway musicals and this one's adaptation to the screen is great.

It was sadder than I expected it to be, but did have its funny moments.I highly recommend the film!",Fiddler on the Roof
114,Mpalin,You want hair? Marry a monkey!,9,6 May 2005,"You want hair? Marry a monkey! Always good advice from a mother. I know Zero Mostel really wanted to revive his role as Tevye for the movie but really, Topol was a much better choice. I am a huge fan of Zero Mostel and I love his work in The Producers and A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum but for a casting choice, Topol is a much more believable Tevye. I have to admit that Topol's dancing rivals the dancing of Gene Kelly and Fred Astaire. (Joking) I have a live recording of Zero Mostel on Broadway in Fiddler on the roof and the cast was not in time with Zero on most of the songs. Sunrise Sunset was horribly off time and it wasn't the fault of the recording. They just didn't have it together. The movie is much cleaner in the songs due to the benefit of dubbing. The saddest thing about this movie is when I realized the time era this movie is set in and I thought about the future of the characters in their final locations and what they historically would have had to deal with being Jewish. Not only is this a great musical, but it is a great movie and a great character study. Definitely a must-see.",Fiddler on the Roof

While i admit the ending is sad (when they leave Anatevka), it is totally realistic. The songs are amazing, and I listen to them all the time. ""Tradition' is my favorite, but there are other good ones as well. The movie is really long, over three hours, so you will need to set aside time to watch it. It probably doesn't need to be as long, but that is my only complaint, What a great movie! Totally worth watching in my opinion. If you get the chance, watch it.

117,Lola-9,"To life, to life, la chayim!",10,5 December 1999,"I love ""Fiddler on the Roof"" so much it's difficult for me to comment on it in a detached way.  I just think about it and I'm filled with emotion. (And I'm not the sentimental type!)  It honestly depicts what it means to be human.  It contains love, faith, family, friendship, humour, violence, hate, prejudice, change, vulnerability, joy, community, anger...everything.  This film is a tribute to the Jewish people, but you don't have to be Jewish to enjoy it.  It's so rich that everyone can identify with it, and learn from it.As for the music, all the songs fit in naturally and stand on their own as classics.  ""Matchmaker, Matchmaker,"" ""Sunrise, Sunset,"" ""If I Were A Rich Man"" - need I say more?  When Hodel sings ""Far From the Home I Love"" it's tissue time.  They're all so beautiful!  If you usually find it hard to take when characters in musicals suddenly burst into song, don't worry, in this film it's so seamless you can't imagine them communicating any other way. The music makes it easier for them to say things they normally wouldn't in conversation.The characters are so real and down-to-earth. They're strong, hard-working people, who have their priorities straight. I can't write about FOTR without mentioning Tevye - the centre of this whirling story, and a man who, like all of us, struggles with the pace with which his world is changing.  He clings to the past, yet accepts what the future may bring. I don't think there is another film out there that addresses how insecure we feel with change. But hey, that's life.

The concepts, so brilliantly performed, provide an excellent opening for the teaching of values, principles, and morals. The story is based on factual situations and includes the opportunity to 'feel' life from a point of view so rarely practiced now. Do not deprive yourself, or your children, the chance to watch this film simply because of the setting--mankind deserves to be examined no matter the differences of the generation.For lovers of musicals, this is a film not to be missed! The lyrics provide additional storyline, as well as insight, to the plot. The masterfully composed tunes will stay in your mind to the point where you will find yourself humming selections from 'Fiddler' well after you've finished watching the movie.The serious tones of this story are well balanced with humour and music.

120,cessnaace,A Wonderful Film!,10,25 November 2005,"I have seen this film several times on DVD in widescreen, which is the only way to see this film. It would be ruined cropped and 'Pan & Scanned.' Norman Jewison shows here that he truly has an eye for filming musicals. It's wonderfully edited as well.The film mixes humor, heavy drama, and sadness in the fate of some of it's characters, into a film that is truly riveting to watch. The musical score is wonderful, arranged and adapted to the screen by John Williams.This film was very popular when released to theaters, worldwide. It was a smash hit in Japan. One may find this odd, until you consider that the film is about the confrontations by old and young generations of matters of tradition. This is the soul of the film, and one of the reasons it played so well in so many countries. Everyone can relate to it's basic message.Jewison relates on the DVD how United Artists had pressured him to sign Zero Mostel for the role that Topal eventually got. Mostel was playing him on Broadway, and his performance was reportedly very good. But once Jewison saw Topal's performance on the London stage, he was convinced that he was the right man for the part. I must admit to agreeing with this, even though I'm a fan of Zero Mostel's work.The entire cast is good, and convincing in their roles. Jewison cast this film very carefully. Considering that it took 18 months to film, Norman Jewison was truly dedicated to this film. And it shows. I recommend this film most highly!",Fiddler on the Roof
121,vondoba,A Beloved Classic Which Will Never Age,10,3 July 2016,"Inspired by the Tevye the Dairyman stories of Sholem Aleichem, the great Yiddish Renaissance writer and playwright, Fiddler on the Roof has its critics. The heavyweight political analyst and cultural critic David P. Goldman (himself Jewish) has indicated he despises Fiddler, as a sentimentalist, corrupted version of the original works that inspired it. Persons who don't appreciate music or musicals may also be left cold by this 1971 movie. But such purist and crabbed views will gain little traction against the large and continuing cultural impact of this film, and the stage play that preceded it, which broke Broadway records in its day—nor should they gain traction, in my opinion, as in some cases there is more to great art than historical fidelity to a source. Indeed, this work, although ""merely"" a musical, opens important dimensions of historical awareness for its audience that, even if rendered somewhat imperfectly, would in all likelihood otherwise have remained closed—assuming the audience doesn't already know a lot about Russian history. The story revolves around the highly sympathetic figure of Tevye the Dairyman, played marvelously by Topol, who with his cows and lame horse (a companion more than a helper) ekes out a grinding existence for his wife and five daughters while reflecting on God's mysterious ways and the dramatic changes underway in his world. As the cruel and dreaded pogroms (persecutions, attacks and murders by Christians, sometimes abetted by the Tsar) reach his village and his daughters encounter and fall in love with young men of uncertain (and even forbidden) favor, Tevye must make a series of increasingly difficult choices, for himself and his family. Set in 1905 Russia as the Bolshevik Revolution winds up, this movie offers an excellent introduction---not a detailed study, but an introduction---to Russia's fascinating history in this period, while giving a great flavor of traditional Jewish village culture in the Pale of Settlement, the age-old homelands of Jews in rural Russia. Throughout, Fiddler offers plenty of Yiddish humor, known for its excellent and ironic joke-craft. According to Wikipedia the work is performed in high schools and play clubs over 500 times a year in the USA alone. With great music and a number of powerful, melodic and unforgettable songs, Fiddler on the Roof deserves its place in the canon of American classics.",Fiddler on the Roof

I share it with anyone who hasn't seen it that I can so that I get a little of the excitement of rediscovering it all over again.  If you haven't seen it you're missing so much!  In a few hours you will laugh, cry, sing and want to dance.  It's infectious and the music stays with you.  Watch it with friends and family and get into the spirit and celebration.

Humor both gentle and witty, and uproarious through razor-edged perfect timing.  And great heaving sighs and tears as the world presses relentlessly on the shoulders of Tevye the Milkman.  Topol's performance is the great rock on which all this is built, as rich and full and complete a movie experience as it is possible to have. Compare the phony ""terror"" of The Sound of Music (the real von Trapps just took a train and didn't go back) with this story that still echos every time you hear the words ""ethnic cleansing"" from yet another part of the world.

126,stinky_pumpkin,Tradition!,9,23 May 2006,"""Fiddler on the Roof"" is one of the great adaptations of a stage musical. It never feels staged, but perfectly fitted for the screen. With some incredibly beautiful cinematography, every moment of ""Fiddler"" is enchanting. We begin with soft colors and a shadow of a fiddler. Topol's first appearance in the film as Tevi, immediately shows us how personal this film will be. We get to know Tevi as he describes what it means to be a fiddler on the roof, as he talks to God (in a very personal manner, yet a manner that shows his lack of knowledge of the Torah that will be attacked by his wife and Rabi throughout the movie and his personal wit that dominates the whole wonderful film). Tevi is very much like a father of a Jane Austen book, desiring against the will of his culture, for the best of his daughters, while his wife and others involved in the family's life are concerned only about marriages for the girls that will leave them finacially secure. Like Jane Austen's female characters, Tevi's daughters are also non-traditional in their desires to marry only for love. Each of them do so, changing the lives of the family, and the community. Though Tevi is concerned primarily of his daughters' happiness, his highest priority is his faith. Though he may compromise traditions, he never compromises his beliefs. This fight then, between the happiness of his family and the traditions of Tevi's faith, bring forth the primary struggle of Tevi's character. Throughout this struggle, we see many different manifestations of it, some that are very humorous, some heartfelt, some heartbreaking, all enchanting.",Fiddler on the Roof

To travel alone to Siberia to marry someone who may or may not be out of jail? What on earth is the excuse for her to go there and not stay with her family at least until he's out of jail?She's literally marrying the time's example of a ""Political extremist""Then, there is Havas, which is simply stupid. In the movie, she barely even tries to get her father to accept. She doesn't make any ultimatums, didn't bring him to family dinner, didn't even properly introduce him.She absolutely abandons her family, without trying.Her ""man"" failed to even properly talk to her father.And worst of all, she's VERY young. This is VERY likely to just be unreasonable teenage infatuation, if I was supposed to support her marriage to that man, the movie writers utterly failed at making me like him or root for him.And worst of all, she didn't even bother to immigrate to New York with them!She could have kept contact! Lived close to her family!She purposefully, willingly & knowingly abandoned her family.If I rated this movie for the 1st half alone, it'd be a 9.If I rated this movie for the 2nd half alone, it'd be a 4.It was incredibly rushed on the 2nd half.And badly made.I still recommend giving the movie a watch. As the 1st half is incredibly well made, but, this already incredibly long movie, instead of just taking a break in the middle, just stop watching there,",Fiddler on the Roof
143,dreamy_alina,Great music! Marvelous performances!,10,1 January 2012,"Fiddler on the roof is that type of movie that brings you a sentiment of content and fulfillment given by the amount of knowledge accumulated at it's final. A movie full of color, art, beauty, naturalness through images and music, acting and screenplay. What makes you reflect a while after seeing this movie is the richness of messages that it transmits. In my opinion, the movie expresses that rules are not always beneficial and that curiosity is good because it allows changing and evolution. More, the movie emphasizes the importance of tradition in the expression of people's devotion towards God.One thing we can learn is that love doesn't take rules into account. And more, it doesn't matter you're poor, it is not wealth that makes us happy. What is the most important thing in our pursuit of happiness is love.The best musical movie I have ever seen.",Fiddler on the Roof
144,olivieriherrera,Fiddle on the Roof coming to Durham NC in 2009,9,1 December 2008,"Fiddler on the Roof is coming to the Durham NC Performing Arts center in March 2009. Click on the link to see details. It will have Topol as part of the cast. He is now 73 years-old and still performing. This is a great opportunity to any musical, drama, performing arts lover and also a cultural experience on Jewish traditions and history. I saw the movie back in the 1980's. i had friends doing the play at school. However, having the opportunity to see Topol is unique. The music is great and already a classic. Many of the original movie cast members already died. http://www.dpacnc.com/broadway/2008-2009/fiddler.html Luis",Fiddler on the Roof
145,hgolds,a musical that has universal appeal,10,16 March 2005,"I saw the next to the last performance of Zero Mostel in New York, I saw other shows with Theodore Bikel. I saw the movie when it was released in 1971. Last night, it was shown on TCM on television. In my estimation, it offers a timeless message. The themes of tolerance and understanding are as applicable today as when it was written.There are areas in the world, where people of different religious believes. cannot live together in the absence of a dictatorial authority. Despite what some may say, the music and the lyrics were great forty years ago,and are still memorable.The dance sequence in the bar and also at the wedding were as good as anything that is offered today. There is a message that everyone can understand and appreciate.",Fiddler on the Roof
146,avindia,Good Family movie to watch by Indians,9,3 January 2011,"Match Maker Match Maker match me a match... Do you love me? Today I watched this movie ""Fiddler on the roof"" at RTNL 7 Channel in Netherlands at my HTEL room at Amsteveen. Really good Musical movie and it reminds you of Indian Bollywood movies(Good bollywood movies only ) While watching this movie I found,India is not the only country who believes in Arranged marriage.It is very true in past and now also in some part of India that rich old/ugly guy can marry a young girl if girl is from poor family. But things are improving so enjoyed the movie after a long timeAvinash Shitole Netherlands",Fiddler on the Roof
147,Resistance_Fighter,I love this movie!,10,9 August 2003,"I think this movie is excellent. The reason that I like it so much is that it was very well-done. I watch it frequently ever since I got it. It is my favorite movie, so far. It is about a poor Russian Jewish milkman named Tevye who has a wife named Golde and 5 daughters whom he is trying to find suitable husbands for. The songs are wonderful, mainly ""Matchmaker, Matchmaker""; ""Tradition"" and ""Far from the Home I Love."" I can hardly recommend ""Fiddler on the Roof"" enough....but I will recommend it as much as I can; I think you should watch it.",Fiddler on the Roof
148,PurplButtafly66,My favorite play,10,30 March 2004,"This is my favorite play ever. I have seen and been in many plays and no matter what I would not change my mind. When I was in the seventh grade my school put on this play and I was casted as Shprintze. This play taught me a lesson in life and it taught many others who have been in it and who have seen it. If you ever have the chance to see this play I would recommend that you do. I gave this play very high ratings. Other plays I would recommend are ""Fame"" and ""Guys and Dolls.""",Fiddler on the Roof
149,melissajones3,One of my favorite movies of all time,10,17 September 2006,"I saw this movie in the theater when I was 17 years old. Topol was excellent. It was amazing to me after watching this movie so many times that I had not noticed Paul Michael Glaser. I thought the casting was marvelous, the music unforgettable and the scenery beautiful. I grew up with my mother watching all musicals. I don't think I missed one. My children also grew up with musicals and I have shared this one with all 5 of them. I am a technical trainer and site some of the lines from this movie. When I was raising 5 children by myself, I recited the line ""I know it is no shame to be poor, but it is no great honor either"" often....",Fiddler on the Roof
150,robbarron,"Sheer, unadulterated JOY!",10,24 January 2006,"How could I give Fiddler on the Roof anything less than 10/10 when it is the closest thing any musical has come to perfection! Without a doubt, Topol's portrayal of Tevye, the Jewish peasant desperate to find good Jewish husbands for his daughters, is one of the greatest performances captured on film. He puts 100% into every little bit giving as perfect a performance at the end as he does at the start. For me, the highlight is still the ever-so-singable 'If I Were A Rich Man' which you almost can't sing without feeling the urge to shrug those shoulders in time with the music! But that sounds like I am dismissing the other wonderful songs which I most certainly am not. How could I when such beautiful melodies as that in 'Sunrise, Sunset' live long in the memory while the funnily desperate sentiments expressed in 'Matchmaker' just make you thankful we don't go through all that palaver to find a marriage partner these days... well, I didn't! :o) 1971, 35 years ago, not that far short of my entire lifetime, yet this musical feels as fresh and vibrant today as it did the day it was first released.I love musicals, I have a wide collection and play many instruments myself but nothing I have elsewhere in my collection nor anything I could ever produce on an instrument could ever come close to Fiddler. The greatest musical ever made into a film. Who cares that it goes on forever? Long may it do so! Cheers, Rob Barron",Fiddler on the Roof
151,neildevlin-49390,Unmissable,10,30 September 2018,"Both life-affirming and heart-wrenching in equal measure. Wonderful set pieces and nuanced detail, humour and pathos, musical numbers and a soundtrack to die for. At whatever level you watch this film on it delivers. Possibly my favourite film of all time. Don't miss out.",Fiddler on the Roof
152,tes-19,Great Comic Moments,9,7 March 2006,"This movie, although generally noted for the touching story and musical numbers, is also an entertaining comedy. For example there is a wonderful frim in which Tevya believes that Lazar Wolfe wants to buy his milk cow, but in reality Lazar Wolfe wants to ask Tevya for the hand of his daughter in marriage. Lazar Wolfe says, ""Why shouldn't you give her up, you have a few more."" All in all, this movie deserves recognition for its wonderfully entertaining comic moments, as well as for its touching story and great music. The cinematography is stunning and the acting is a joy.The sequence in which Tevya recounts his supposed dream about the consequences of a marriage by their daughter to Lazar Wolfe, the heart of the story from the wonderful Sholom Aleichem book, ""The Old Country"" is wonderfully done.",Fiddler on the Roof
153,vargopenny,"Fabulous, moving movie/musical!",10,22 December 2018,"I found this to be a very touching, inspiring, heart felt movie. The songs are pure magic.
This movie touches all your emotions.",Fiddler on the Roof
