0,TheLittleSongbird,To be admired more for its ambition than for its execution,3,10 June 2016,"'Jupiter Ascending' is not a complete disaster, but it is one of the biggest wastes of potential personally seen in recent memory. There are some very interesting ideas here and there is some ambitious scope, so 'Jupiter Ascending' had real potential to be great, but these ideas are practically lost in space.Starting with a few good things, much of 'Jupiter Ascending' looks great. The special effects are out of this world good, the film is beautifully shot and the production design has much colour, atmosphere and astonishing realism, successfully at first allowing the viewer to be immersed in and captivated by the world the characters inhabit. The music is rousing, haunting and lusciously as well as thrillingly bombastically orchestrated. 'Jupiter Ascending' also boasts one good performance, that of an effortlessly cool and sincere Sean Bean.Channing Tatum is not that awful an actor but he can do nothing with his worthless material, here he's very wooden and displays little involvement and charisma. Worse is Mila Kunis, who shows the emotional range of a zombie. Their chemistry is so cold and clinical, one can be forgiven for thinking that it's non-existent. On the other side of the acting spectrum, Eddie Redmayne tries far too hard as the villain and comes over as more very bizarre than threatening. With the sole exception of Bean, all the cast do a lousy job.They are disadvantaged by the listless direction by the Wachowskis, very sketchily written characters and a script that is clunky in structure and with such toe curlingly bad dialogue, some of the worst of any big-budget film since 'Pearl Harbor'. While 'Jupiter Ascending' is mostly fine visually, there is an overload of special effects that it comes at the expense of any sense and soul and some of the editing is both sloppy and choppy. The action is a mixed bag, some of it is diverting and other parts lack fun, tension and most of all cohesion.If there is one element where 'Jupiter Ascending' falls down most heavily, it is the story. The story had a great ambitious concept with some equally great ideas, but explores the concept and ideas very little, barely even, and its themes are only lightly touched upon. Structurally and dramatically the film is a badly disorganised mess, some parts don't even make much sense, indicating that the film was intended to be like at least twenty minutes longer but had to be cut down. There is a distinct lack of suspense, tension and soul, some effort was clearly made but it was like people's hearts weren't properly in it. Pacing is all over the place, the actual story feels rushed, indicating that the film would have worked better at least twenty minutes longer as a film or as a mini-series, but because the experience is so emotionally and dramatically empty it feels dull too.Overall, a very messy but good looking film. To be admired more for its ambition, which promised much, than its execution, which is quite poor in several big areas. 3/10 Bethany Cox",Jupiter Ascending
1,bkoganbing,The queen is scrubbing toilets,4,6 May 2017,"Who would have thought that the monarch of earth is a poor immigrant from the Ukraine in the USA barely getting by as a maid and scrubbing toilets of the rich and richer. Yet a whole lot of aliens are interested in match stick girl Mila Kunis because she's got royal DNA.It turns out that a whole lot of aliens and they're God-like creatures compared to where we are on the evolutionary scale. One of those interested in here is futuristic space soldier Channing Tatum who has none of those wolf like tendencies though he is part wolf. But not the pejorative kind of wolf, Mila has royal DNA and he treats her as the princess she is. He's also got himself a pair of magic boots that enable him to fly just like Superman.During the course of Jupiter Ascending we learn about the earth's greater history including what happened to the dinosaurs and what could happen if an unscrupulous family gets a hold of the Earth. One of them, Douglas Booth an outer space Snidely Whiplash almost marries Kunis.This film has pretensions to be Star Wars, but it reminds me more of that classic episode from Married With Children where little green aliens come to steal Al Bundy's socks.And in the end when the good guys win I kind of think that Mila Kunis might as Queen of the Earth would have exercised a few more royal prerogatives than she did.",Jupiter Ascending
2,Leofwine_draca,The Wachowskis continue their descent into cinematic irrelevance,3,23 April 2017,"JUPITER ASCENDING sees the Wachoski siblings continuing their descent into cinematic irrelevance following SPEED RACER and CLOUD ATLAS; the latter of those wasn't too awful, just bland, while SPEED RACER was astonishingly bad. JUPITER ASCENDING falls somewhere between those two definitions; it's a sprawling would-be science fiction epic chock-full of trite dialogue and clichéd characters who seem to think they're in STAR WARS or something.There are two main problems with the production. The writing is choppy and messy, with characters feeling bland and weak, no more than one-dimensional in the case of the consistently overrated Channing Tatum. The direction is very poor, particularly so in the endless action sequences, filled with CGI effects that do nothing for the viewer, and shot in a shaky, badly-edited fashion so that it's difficult to make out what you're supposed to be seeing. Mila Kunis is an unlikeable and unsympathetic lead and Eddie Redmayne makes for a ham-fisted villain. The only one who comes out of this with his head held high is the reliable Sean Bean, and even he doesn't have that much screen time.",Jupiter Ascending
3,SnoopyStyle,has potential but bad writing and overblown CGI,5,9 July 2015,"Jupiter Jones (Mila Kunis) hates her life as a maid working with her mother. Her father was killed by criminals back in Russia before her birth on the ship going over to America. She is selling her eggs when she is almost killed by aliens. She's rescued by genetically engineered hunter Caine Wise (Channing Tatum) who was hired by Titus Abrasax. Balem Abrasax (Eddie Redmayne) is the powerful emperor who owns Earth and wants Jupiter dead. With Kalique Abrasax, the three siblings are the heirs of the House of Abrasax. Caine brings Jupiter to former comrade Stinger Apini (Sean Bean) who discovers that she's royal.This movie is overwhelmed by CGI and badly written as a story. The basic idea of a girl who discovers that she's actually royal is as old as fairy tales and as successful as the most iconic Disney movies. This has the ability to do just the same. Whenever it seem to be about to straighten itself out, the movie just turns dumb. There are attempts at comedy which fail. The story is messy. There is plenty of action which never feels completely visceral. Redmayne is doing something weird and less than threatening.It would be nice to see a harvest and make it apocalyptic. They put in so much CGI that it seems silly not to energize the opening 5 minutes with a devastating harvest. Then Balem is portrayed as all powerful and yet he doesn't just bombard Earth. It doesn't feel like he send in his A team to kill Jupiter. Next it doesn't make sense that she would marry Titus. Titus is right that she's very gullible. While the old Disney princesses were successful, their days of waiting for Prince Charming are over. Jupiter cannot be that dumb. Another one is that she's really stupid to go to Balem in his ship rather than on the AEGIS. Again she's too dumb to be compelling as the heroine. There is too many times when Caine rides in to the rescue. She needs to be the modern princess where she's the hero.",Jupiter Ascending
4,Prismark10,Not hitting the heights,4,19 July 2016,"The Wachowski's are still drinking from the well thanks to The Matrix Trilogy but this ambitious science fiction epic is a disappointment due to an underwhelming story and acting.Jupiter (Mila Kunis) works as a cleaner in Chicago with her Russian émigré family when she is suddenly pursued by intergalactic bounty hunters and saved by a half man/half dog or wolf (Channing Tatum.)Jupiter is a reincarnation of a powerful cosmic dynasty who had fallen out with her three children.As in The Matrix, one of the children was harvesting the earth when in due course the humans would be melted for a powerful elixir that keeps the wealthy alive. However Jupiter is a pawn within this wealthy dynasty as the others take advantage of her naivety.This is a big budget action film but there is no chemistry between Tatum and Kunis. In fact there was better chemistry between Tatum and Sean Bean.The film has fine visuals and some good action sequences but the story was too convoluted and this wealthy cosmic dynasty filled with some wooden actors with Eddie Redmayne being so subdued as if he does not quiet believe the dialogue.There is something in this movie that never clicks and hence the disappointment. Maybe the film is just too messy and incoherent.",Jupiter Ascending
5,claudio_carvalho,What a Mess!,3,10 May 2015,"""Jupiter Ascending"" is among the worst sci-fi I have ever seen. It is impressive how producers spend their money in a movie with top-notch CGI and cinematography but messy story and screenplay; inexistent direction; and awful acting. The plot begins ""throwing"" characters and situations on the screen without any reasonable development. The viewer sees a young woman living illegally in Chicago cleaning toilets and houses hunted down by aliens since she is the heiress of the universe. This premise might have been written by someone on drugs of mentally ill. Then the viewer sees the lead couple with maybe the worst chemistry in the cinema history: Mila Kunis and Channing Tatum. Mila Kunis is totally miscast and the imbecility of her actions is consistent with her background of loser. I saw the movie until the very end and it is impressive how stupid and senseless it is. My vote is three.Title (Brazil): ""O Destino de Júpiter"" (""The Fate of Jupiter"")",Jupiter Ascending
6,nogodnomasters,TO LIVE IS TO CONSUME,6,2 May 2018,"Jupiter's dad was an astronomy buff and tagged her with the name ""Jupiter Jones"" (Mila Kunis) because ""Pluto Nash"" reeks of a ""B"" movie. Destined to clean toilets, Jupiter has no idea she has royal DNA, the cosmic Cinderella story. She is going to be the ""Queen Bee"" of the planet and look beautiful forever, except there are aliens who want her dead and also that enslavement thing. We find out a large corporate family owns the planet and wants to harvest the over populated planet of its human DNA, except for her who happens to have Royal DNA.Her prince is a man named Caine Wise (Channing Tatum) who has flying boots and wolf ears.I didn't see any thank yous in the credits to ""Star Odyssey"" the ""B"" Italian film from which the Wachowskis borrowed some of their plot: ""The planet is sold to an evil despot named Kress, who soon flies to ""Sol 3"" to start gathering humanoid slaves to sell to his evil counterparts.""Their films (Matrix) once again attempts to introduce ideas of ownership and enslaved masses for a higher class while using ugly creatures that looked like they came from ""Dark Crystal."" The film fell flat in entertainment as our main character was never developed beyond her DNA and occupation. The plot was laborious in making points interfering with the flow of the film.It could have been better scripted, directed, and edited.Guide: No f-bombs or sex. Partial butt nudity.",Jupiter Ascending
7,kosmasp,I love puppies too,6,21 June 2015,"And I'm not only writing this, because Mila Kunis might read this and fall in love with me (although anything is possible, right? No? OK.), I mean it. Also I did like the quirky banter that can be described as awkward and not fitting for a blockbuster movie. That's the good you could say (and add the visual effects to it, which can and fit entirely the blockbuster thread).But there's also the bad. Which is a pseudo philosophical world. A world where siblings stand for different views and so forth. It's not that I cared or do care about them, but I know there is subtext there not only hidden in the names of the characters, but also their motivation. Problem? It doesn't work - and as already said: Nobody cares! Sometimes it seems even Mila Kunis character doesn't care.Mila can pull off leading roles though, so while it's her vehicle (with Tatum as sidekick and what woman wouldn't want him on her side? Not many straight women I suppose, but I could be wrong), the steering is done by others. Sometimes in the wrong direction, the faces that crash though are those of the actors involved ... almost a shame. And can someone/everyone please stop typecasting Sean Bean? Thank you!And still through all this, this was kind of a fun ride. I did enjoy sitting and watching this more than I did something dreadful as ""After Earth"" ... which may not be saying much, but there you go",Jupiter Ascending
8,classicsoncall,"""Does any part of you wanna bite me?""",6,6 May 2020,"If this is the very first sci-fi movie you've ever seen, you might be impressed with the cosmic splendor of it all, what with the astonishingly futuristic CGI and stunning cinematography. I can't help thinking what ""Star Wars: A New Hope"" might have been like with the technological advances we have today. But setting aside all the dazzling color and blazing action, there's not much of a story here, and what there is feels derivative of any number of galaxy spanning films you might have seen over the course of your lifetime. As for the principals, every time I see Mila Kunis I can't help thinking that she was a winner in an Angelina Jolie look-alike contest. After seeing Eddie Redmayne as Stephen Hawking in ""The Theory of Everything"", I can't really relate to him as the First Primary of the Royal Abrasax family. And that's another thing, the Wachowski's keep you totally off balance with the name 'Abrasax', which feels like a mis-spelling of the Greek word 'Abraxas', but in actuality it's just the reverse, which totally managed to surprise me when I looked it up. I can't find a whole lot to recommend the picture other than it's dynamic, come right at you action sequences, but even then, some of them are stretched way too long, like when the Whitley Streiber-looking aliens called 'Keepers' engaged in an interminable chase scene with partial wolf-man Caine Wise (Channing Tatum). That's another thing, Tatum's character was a lycantant, but in the end analysis, that had nothing really to do with his character or motivation. Don't ask me, I can't explain it.",Jupiter Ascending
9,Tweekums,Utterly bonkers but strangely enjoyable Sci-Fi,7,28 July 2016,"This science fiction adventure has a rather unlikely protagonist; Jupiter Jones works as a cleaner not knowing that she is genetically identical to late matriarch of the powerful Abrasax family and she could inherit her property including Earth! It turns out humanity didn't evolve on Earth; Earth is just one of many planets were human genes were introduced with the intention of harvesting the population to create a serum that the wealthiest of the original humans use to radically extend their lives. Jupiter is targeted because of her genetics; Balem Abrasax doesn't want her claiming her inheritance just as Earth becomes ready for harvesting. Titus Abrasax is keen to stop his brother so sends Caine Wise, a former soldier, to save her. Jupiter's life is suddenly and radically changed as she goes from cleaning toilets to being chased by aliens, being treated like royalty by some and targeted by others. All this leads to a spectacular confrontation with Balem.It must be said that this film is utterly bonkers; the story is a bit of a mess, arch-villain Balem is one of the campest I've seen thanks to Eddie Redmayne's rather affected performance and his brother Titus clearly has Oedipal issues as he tries to marry Jupiter; the genetic reincarnation of his mother! There is also plenty of cheesy dialogue. All this should make it terrible but strangely I found it all rather enjoyable. I wouldn't say the cast does a great job but they do keep things fun. The special effects are impressive and there is plenty of exciting action. Viewers are likely to spot several nods to other films; the best being a section dealing with a bureaucracy that could have been taken from the film 'Brazil' which ends with a cameo by Terry Gilliam! Overall I'd say that anybody looking for anything meaningful or even coherent is likely to be disappointed but anybody who enjoys utterly bonkers science fiction should have a great time.",Jupiter Ascending
10,Quinoa1984,"the new Dune - I mean that in all its epic, grandiose, enjoyable folly glory",5,5 February 2015,"Is she ""the One"" again? Are human beings harvested for their energy once again? Will the One fall in love with whoever eyes match first? Will Eddie Redmayne ever top (or sink lower) than this? Good God, so many questions...The Wachowskis - Andy and Lana - show with a film like Jupiter Ascending, as well as their others (even Speed Racer, yes I said it) that they're not hacks. At least, not hacks to the money-grubbing system of Hollywood. Or, well, they DO like making money, I suppose - two Matrix sequels speak to that - but they mostly speak to what they love, and as it just so happens Hollywood is usually down for what they do (Cloud Atlas even, up to a point, thanks to the cast, which was their most ambitious outing to date). This is a work by filmmakers who are given a budget so gigantic that they do make sure to put the money on the screen... and the script has enough words to match any descriptions of space and ships and planets and Eddie Redmayne's costume and Channing Tatum's fake teen-wolf jaw.The plot of this flick is about the discovery of Jupiter Jones (Mila Kunis, and why she has the last name 'Jones' and is the daughter of Russians, hey, why carp, I guess). Turns out, she's royalty in the universe, and what a giant universe it is: various 'Houses' are on planets throughout the system, and the House Abraxas has its eye on Jupiter Jones - turns out she is the reincarnation of the mother to the children of the throne (or something, I guess, far as I could follow), James D'Arcy, Tuppence Middleton, and Redmayne. But she's eyed to be killed for reasons that involve things with the Earth and populations and things that I shouldn't go into for too many useless spoilers.All that you need to know is - she's ""The One"", if not AS 'The One' as Neo was in the Matrix, and the reasons for so many other outside-Earth-beings wanting a piece of Earth are also similar for the main conflict of The Matrix (human harvesting, in short). And also as soon as the ""Hunter"" Caine (Tatum) shows up and sweeps Jupiter off her feet through (legitimately) breathtaking chases through Chicago or across star systems, you should know what you're in for: a big mashed potato mix of a science fiction space opera blockbuster. Characters explain quite a lot, in the second act at least, about how the universe really works and yet, ultimately, it all comes down to elements familiar as we've seen in many other space operas: rigged marriages, fiendish power plays, blue-blood royalty, dogged male determinism, and some enjoyable hijinks.And yet the Wachowskis aren't doing a put-on, or even a wink-and-a-nod like we saw last year with Guardians of the Galaxy (which, if Warners had the gall to release it last summer would've surely had that awesome juggernaut to deal with). This isn't to say there aren't homages, oh heavens no - even down to an appearance by a wonderful iconoclast film director, and a reference to his own science fiction masterpiece come up pretty blatantly, albeit his appearance made me smile ear to ear for his full five minutes. And surely this guy/gal duo have read Dune, all of them, and sunk their teeth into Heavy Metal and Flash Gordon and, to their credit, they stick to their visions. This is hardcore sci-fi spectacle filmmaking, and they put clearly a great deal of love and thought with John Toll their DP and the special FX team. You do get your eyes worth here.As far as substance? That'll depend on how much the viewer can take things like (I'm not kidding) telepathic, royalty-sympathetic bees, mind-wipes and easy-to-fix solutions for skyscrapers, and uh, well... Eddie Redmayne. I should let this go, but I can't. The nominee for best actor in a leading role this year also gives one of the most baffling, awful performances, and yet I'm not sure how it goes wrong. I can see why he was cast as this guy - he can pull off this snotty, fey royalty for sure, but trying to voice it like Lord Voldemort's kid doesn't do any favors. It's a glorious watch to see him act evil and conniving, and is surely on level with the most guilty-pleasure villain performances since... well, David Lynch's Dune, I suppose, or the more baffling Star Trek pictures. I almost recommend the picture just for him.As for the actual leads, they're fine, far as it goes. Kunis is given kind of the short-shrift really with her character, basically a damsel in distress (mostly, she can defend herself if she has to), and Tatum does deliver some sincere work alongside the likes of Sean Bean. They seem to be trying, but with what? Jupiter Ascending is beautifully crafted fluff made by (I mean this in the most complementary way possible) grown-ass geeks who may have tapped out what they have left in the genre. It's a I-can't-recommend-it-but-I-won't-stop-you type of review here.",Jupiter Ascending
11,preppy-3,It's a mess but visually incredible,7,12 February 2015,"The plot is needlessly convoluted but it goes something like this--Jupiter Jones (Mila Kunis) is in her 20s and hates her life. Then she finds out she's the reincarnation of a murdered queen on a distant planet. The kids of the queen want her out of the way but bounty hunter Caine West (Channing Tatum) protects her with help from Stringer Apini (Sean Bean).The plot doesn't make a lot of sense. The plot gets needlessly involved into characters and situations that add nothing to the story. There's also plot holes galore and the dialogue is unbelievably bad. Acting doesn't help. Kunis and Tatum (playing a half man half wolf) can be good but not here. Even worse is Eddie Redmayne playing the bad guy. Seriously--WHAT was he thinking? He whispers all his lines while occasionally screaming a line now and then. It's isn't scary or amusing...just annoying. Only Bean gives a good performance. Still, aside from all this I sort of enjoyed it. The visuals are incredible--there's always something to look at. The special effects are flawless and there's plenty of fast, furious action with PG-13 violence. So visually it's worth seeing but the lousy plot, dialogue and acting detract.",Jupiter Ascending

13,CinemaSerf,A must for the apiarists amongst us...,5,2 May 2020,"Where to start? This is a mess - a very good looking, visual effects designer's wet-dream of a film; but the plot is a shambles and the sight of Channing Tatum doing his best ""Mr. Tumnus"" impression coupled with Eddie Redmayne as a sort of ""Ming the Manicured"" villain makes this very much a case of style over substance. A girl, Mila Kunis, has been born on Earth - the heir to an intergalactic kingdom and so the Abrasax (Redmayne and Douglas Booth) brothers who currently rule the galaxy determine that they must marry her. Meantime, she has fallen for the pixie-esque Tatum who is out - along with an incredibly stolid Sean Bean - to save her from her manipulated fate...

14,utgard14,"""Please call me Jupe.""",6,26 April 2015,"Pointy-eared bounty hunter Caine Wise (Channing Tatum) rescues toilet cleaning Earthling Jupiter Jones (Mila Kunis) from aliens trying to kill her. Turns out she's a reincarnated bee queen or something. Anyway, Jupiter's at the center of some intergalactic royalty drama with three weird siblings. Beats cleaning toilets, I guess.Well, the Wachowskis once again make a movie that seems to divide audiences. At least this time it's entertaining and not pretentious drivel. Don't get me wrong -- it's nothing great. The special effects are decent but nothing groundbreaking or impressive. None of the set pieces are all that special. The acting varies in quality and the dialogue is pretty awful, particularly when it's coming from people using bad accents. Mila Kunis is nice to look at but brings little to the part beyond that. I think she should stick to comedy. Her dramatic work (as much as this qualifies) shows her limitations. Channing Tatum does surprisingly well despite the handicap of being made up to look like a space elf. Eddie Redmayne hams it up big time. Some will find that fun and others will cringe. I just find it amusing this guy won an Oscar the same year he gave this performance. Also, beware of his close-ups. That's all I'll say on that.Problems aside, it's a diverting and unchallenging space opera. The Wachowskis' attempt at Star Wars. Doesn't quite hit the mark but it's enjoyable for what it is. I think it's their best movie since Speed Racer. I was surprised by one thing -- here we have basically an old-fashioned story where the beautiful princess has to be saved (repeatedly) by the handsome knight. She does take care of herself in one fight scene but, for most of the movie, she's in need of rescue. It's just kind of funny to see that in a movie made in this day and age, by the Wachowskis no less.

Hopefully, there will NOT be two more JUPITER flicks, as the Wachowski outlook is depressing as Hell. ""Why bother living?"" is the main question posed by each of these four movies. Their alternate realities are amoral, chaotic, nihilistic, meaningless, atheistic, cold, stark, brutal, inhumane, nasty, and squalid. JUPITER ASCENDING adds a blatant incest theme to the ""fun,"" as Jupiter comes within a whisker of willingly marrying her biological son (or vice versa--it's pretty hard to wrap your head around such trash).

It's like watching the ending of FORBIDDEN PLANET with a few more computers thrown in to generate the visual effects.

16,neil-476,"Big, loud, colourful, popcorn-munching fun",8,13 February 2015,"A prologue tells us of Jupiter Jones' birth: English astronomer father Maximilian, visiting Russia, falls in love and marries but is killed during a robbery: mother moves to the US, giving birth on the way. Jupiter grows up in Chicago in an extended family of immigrant Russians, doing menial cleaning work for a rich family where she seems to be friendly with the daughter. Then she is whisked away by a half wolf man on rocket skates after intergalactic bounty hunters arrive trying to kill her. It turns out she is a reborn incarnation of a wealthy cosmic matriarch who is in the position of retroactively disinheriting her three children, which goes down particularly badly with one of them, Balem, who is seeking to ""harvest"" Earth (ie. melt down the human population to create an elixir which keeps the cosmic super-rich alive for generations), hence the attempts to murder Jupiter before this can happen. Jupiter is thrust, unwittingly, into a new life of intrigue, manoeuvrings, and extreme danger.Jupiter Ascending is a big budget, big story, science fiction extravaganza by the Wachowski siblings. It is full of action from the start, has some great story material, masses of eye candy from start to finish, decent 3D, good actors giving decent performances of pleasing characters, and a satisfactory resolution as well as the possibility of franchise continuation.However, there's always a ""but"", isn't there? The ""but"" with Jupiter Ascending is that there is so much crammed into it that you don't always get what you need (or what you think you need) from a storytelling point of view. I'm quite happy not to be spoon fed – which is just as well, because you are left to figure out much of this film as it goes along – but there is quite a lot here where a bit more explanation would be welcome. Is Jupiter's birth as a reincarnation of (un-named) Cosmic Mom a result of some sort of unmentioned cosmic intercession, or is it just some sort of accident/coincidence (in which case I suggest that those cosmic laws on inheritance need looking at)? Why is there only one pair of rocket skates? They seem terribly useful. How does the instant city rebuilding work? (OK, we don't really need to know that). How did the siblings find out about Jupiter and why did it take them so long? How does it tie in with her birth circumstances? What was so significant about her birth circumstances that we needed to be shown what happened? How come the bounty hunters and rescue dog man both arrived at the same time? What was the relationship between Jupiter and rich friend who she cleans for and whose identity she assumed at the fertility clinic? What was up with Sean Bean's daughter and why did it take so long between her single plot-relevant cough and the inadequate one-line payoff? There are plenty of other questions and, unfortunately, I found them taking precedence over the action.The action pounds along relentlessly. The eye candy is wonderful. Channing Tatum is dogged in his protection of Mila Kunis' Jupiter (har har). Eddie Redmayne is silkily menacing (a bit too quiet and indistinct) and terrific when he loses it. There are little skeleton creepy aliens, dragon men, and all sorts between (including some people under makeup who I only realised who they were when the cast list came up). It is big bombastic fun and I enjoyed it.",Jupiter Ascending
17,anaconda-40658,Jupiter Ass-Ending!,2,4 May 2015,"Jupiter Ascending (2015): Dir: Andy Wachowski, Lana Wachowski / Cast: Channing Tatum, Mila Kunis, Sean Bean, Eddie Redmayne, Douglas Booth: Diarrhea blast of special effects and the notion that Andy and Lana Wachowski should never be handed another dime to make a film. After success with The Matrix they followed up with two stupid sequels as well as junk like Speed Racer. The futuristic screenplay is about the same mess as a bout of constipation that explodes before you reach the toilet. Mila Kunis had a weird birth where her father was shot and her mother raised her in isolation. She is next seen cleaning toilets before she is attacked and nearly probed by aliens. Enter Channing Tatum who bursts in out of nowhere wearing boots that allow him to fly around. This is ridiculous, and he beats up these creatures before rescuing Kunis. We discover other idiotic aspects of her. She apparently attracts bees, and is seen as royalty by those on the alien planet. She also goes through wardrobe chances within seconds. Others appearing in this barf bag embarrassment are Sean Bean, whose first scene has him punching around Tatum, likely reacting to the frustration of being cast in this junk. Eddie Redmayne delivers a performance as the villain that is so horrid that it seems likely that his testicles were compressed to the extremes in order to allow him that pitiful voice he gives off. Kunis is even nearly manipulated into marrying some schmuck who wants to control everything after a plan to murder her.

Only when Caine Wise, a genetically engineered ex-military hunter, arrives on Earth to track her down, does Jupiter begin to glimpse the fate that has been waiting for her all along. Her genetic signature marks her as next in line for an extraordinary inheritance that could alter the balance of the cosmos......Well The Wachowskis have done it again. They have made another phenomenal, highly original film, that has bombed hard. But hey, I don't work for a movie studio, and I didn't put millions into the production of the film, so I couldn't care less.What I care about is being entertained, and despite the fact that the plot is bonkers, I had a whale of a time watching this, probably the most camp movie I've seen since The Fifth Element.Three siblings own lots of planets, and they harvest the population of that planet and use them as a serum to keep them young forever, and earth is very important. But we find out that Jupiter owns earth and the siblings will do anything to possess earth. Like marry Jupiter, or overact within an inch of their life.So half human, half dog Tatum comes to rescue her, and she falls for him.If that doesn't sound bonkers enough, we also have Sean Bean as some sort of Bee leader, a wonderful homage to Brazil, with a great cameo from Terry Gilliam, and flying boots....If you can appreciate the absurdity of Science Fiction movies such as Dune, and Flash Gordon, you will find much to like here. Make up is wonderful, the special effects, as expected from the groundbreaking directors, are awe-inspiring, but it's the wonderful, over the top set pieces, and the questionable acting, that really makes the film alive.Step forward Redmayne, you are the best thing about the film. He channels Ming the Merciless, and Gary Oldman, as the chief bad guy, neck to one side, whispering, and then Shouting!!! Very Loudly!! for no good reason. He is a joy to watch, but he's appreciating the film itself, he's obviously read the script, known how daft the whole film is, and just thought 'let's have a bit of fun'. And to be fair, he's been in a lot of serious stuff, so let him have his fun.The $175 million budget is there to be seen on screen,the initial ariel attack on earth is the best thing about the film, and it doesn't give up right until the end.Its a shame though that it's going to fail, because its original, fun, and very inventive, so what if Tatum plays a half dog with flying boots? If you leave a cinema happy, with a huge smile on your face, you know the film has done its job.See it on the biggest,loudest screen, and just go with it.Destined to become a cult film in years to come, when it will finally be appreciated like it should be now.",Jupiter Ascending
19,phd_travel,Spectacular visually but partly incomprehensible,4,16 February 2015,"This is a spectacular loud party comprehensible sci fi movie. The visuals are spectacular from the Chicago aerial fight scenes to the overdone space battles. As far as a comprehensible plot, there have been worse sci fi movies. Nowadays understanding about 30 percent is considered good. So more or less I got what was going on but got lost now and then about who was fighting who about what. Something about harvesting the Earth by some battling outer space siblings. The story on Earth started off quite interesting with the Russian family but then things got too complicated with the aliens.Mila managed to pull off the titular role with some cute charm as the cleaning maid turned space royalty. Channing Tatum as a wolf thing looked a bit overweight - needs to cut out the carbs. Eddie Redmayne was grotesque with his laryngitis voice and occasional outbursts. Even science fiction pretty Douglas Booth was better in his role. Couldn't get everything Sean Bean said.Overall it is watchable for the lead actors despite the partly incomprehensible plot.",Jupiter Ascending
20,zetes,"A big mess, though often great to look at",6,1 March 2015,"My first 2015 film. I usually try to see something the first weekend in February, but I have been too lazy. This was really the only film that interested me, and, to be honest, it didn't interest me THAT much. The poor reviews are mostly correct. This just isn't very good. It's hardly torture, and the amazing visuals are enough to make it fairly watchable. But it's a mess. It feels like it was edited down from three hours. There's a ton going on, and it's all very sloppily thrown together. It's not exactly hard to follow, but that's mostly because the plot is cobbled together from science fiction and fantasy clichés. Even if we had a longer version that spent more time developing the situation, it wouldn't have been any better. The two main heroes (played by Channing Tatum and Mila Kunis) are dull as dishwater. The villains are a little better. Eddie Redmayne has gotten a lot of guff for his hammy performance as an evil aristocrat, but whenever he's on screen it's a lot more fun. His two siblings (also evil), played by Douglas Booth and Tuppence Middleton, are also amusing. Tatum should really avoid these kinds of big action movies. They really bring out his worst side. Kunis isn't necessarily bad, but her character is woefully underdeveloped and she spends 90% of the movie as little more than a damsel in distress (she's clinging to Tatum for a good half the movie). I'd also complain that the action sequences are fairly bad. It's very hard to follow them. As much as I could complain about it, as I said earlier, it's a very good looking movie. The costumes in particular are just amazing.",Jupiter Ascending

After seen it 3 things came to my mind.This was really made to become a hit just see all the names playing in it. Secondly i thought that the effects used were stunning. This is really well done on all part but of course effects doesn't make a movie. And it's there that the failure is made for this flick. I purely watched it for the effects and the 3D which worked out fine too. Be honest, this is another love story taking place in space. Sadly it had to go against the year the new Star Wars came out and this one failed completely.

I know it's going to be one of those movies that you or hate or love. What I don't get is why people that don't like CGI's are watching science fiction blockbusters like this one? You know it's a science fiction, so you know you will get a ton of CGI scenes. It didn't bother me at all. In fact I loved those scenes. The story itself was good to me for a science fiction movie. The idea of humans on earth being considered as cattle was a nice touch. The only thing that bothered me in the movie was that they had to put some romance in it. Was that really necessary?

And unlike most of the films right now, the action keeps up the pace throughout the movie, it doesn't just have a few cool scenes that end up in the trailer.Is it a smart story that makes one philosophical question the meaning of life? No. It is a puerile story of intergalactic feudal royalty of human origins that controls the entire universe, of girls that wash toilets and find out they are princesses, of loyal knights that love and protect them and of evil men with no scruples that try to kill them. Yes, it is a fairy tale. But a visually stunning one, with beautiful actors and amazing special effects.Bottom line: forever remembered as the movie in which Sean Bean doesn't die, Jupiter Ascending is a science fiction upgrade of a standard princesses and knights fairy tale. Once one realizes that, one can fully enjoy the good special effects and the fast pace. It lasts for two hours, but it never lets up the action.",Jupiter Ascending
24,StevePulaski,One of the only mediocre films that needs our support,4,11 February 2015,"If ""Jupiter Ascending"" predictably bombs hard, or even struggles to barely break even, this could mean the future of big-budget, original science-fiction projects are a thing of the past. Over $200 million was invested into ""Jupiter Ascending,"" marketing costs included, and a return on investment of about $400 – $500 would deem the film a marginal success in Hollywood accounting terms. With that goal likely not being reached, studios are pragmatically more hesitant to release films boasting original content and will presumably continue to cling, perhaps more heavily, towards established franchises or work to reboot classics, like ""Ghostbusters"" and ""Indiana Jones."" ""Jupiter Ascending"" is a thoroughly risky, questionable film; while it's not that great, it should still be supported for the sake of optimism in seeing more original content in Hollywood.The film creates a world where Earth's inhabitants are unaware that a countless number of other planets have been claimed by wealthy aliens with the goal of harvesting evolved living creations upon reaching a state of perfection achieved by social Darwinism. This will produce a breed of youth serum that will effectively make them immortal. With the death of the matriarch of the House of Abrasax, one of the top alien dynasties to ever rule, her children Balem (Eddie Redmayne), Titus (Douglas Booth), and Kalique (Tuppence Middleton) bicker for her inheritance, with Balem taking possession of a production complex on the planet Jupiter and Titus bearing his own plans to corrupt the plans for the youth serum.With that, we focus on Jupiter Jones (Mila Kunis), conceived by astronomer Maximilian Jones (James D'Arcy) and Aleksa (Maria Doyle Kennedy) shortly after the death of Maximilian after a home invasion. In her adult years, despite believing she was destined for greatness, Jupiter is stuck as a janitor for wealthy people. In a desperate attempt for extra cash, Jupiter is nearly killed by doctors and nurses turning out to be agents sent by Balem to kill her when they discover her motivations to disrupt the social order of the planets. Jupiter is narrowly saved by Caine Wise (Channing Tatum), a genetically-engineered fighter, who vows to protect Jupiter during her mission of discovering her origin within a mythical and limitless world.If this sounds confusing or perplexing, it's because it is; ""Jupiter Ascending"" is only two hours long, and for a film attempting to create its own world, compile it with rich, detailed backstory, and focus on a vast array of characters of varying motivations, that's a very short runtime. The Wachowski's have never had an issue with ambition, as all of their films are conducted on a grandscale, fearlessly operating with a sense of narrative immunity to convention. The issue is in detailing their central points, like their characters and the clarity of the film's plot. Large amounts of ambition and a vast scope can't mask the fact that ""Jupiter Ascending""'s peculiar casting decisions and lack of character development/interest work against the quality of the final product.Mila Kunis hasn't been an actress who has been able to take on a daring lead role with conviction, despite some success in ""Friends With Benefits."" She has a woodenness to her that prohibits any kind of character sympathy. Meanwhile, Channing Tatum is like that shy guy at the party who you know is fun to be around, but when he's in the wrong social setting, as he is here, he shrivels up and becomes almost anemic and unrecognizably bland. Combine that with the entire feeling of emptiness in their characters and you have the strongest vessels of the screenplay unable to establish a connection to carry such a weighty project.""Jupiter Ascending""'s visuals, however, are stunning. The film is kaleidoscopic, boasting a wondrous palette of colors, vibrant textures, and boundless atmospheres, all of which Oscar-worthy or at least worthy of some recognition. The world that the Wachowski's and an army of special effects specialists create almost makes one forget what they're watching is a film that is middling on most other fronts besides visuals and art direction. Again, ""Jupiter Ascending"" is an interesting anomaly of a film; it's a film that isn't worthy of great praise outside of obvious visuals, but if we want originality and any hope for a future that is open to the possibility of new ideas, we must support this effort with our pocketbooks. The decision, as always, is up to you, consumer.",Jupiter Ascending
25,Rainey-Dawn,I Only Watched It For Sean Bean,5,4 September 2018,I don't know what I expected out of this film - but I didn't expect what I watched. I watched the first hour then I fast-forwarded it to Sean Bean's parts - just to watch him. If I was a few years younger I'm sure I would have enjoyed the movie more than I do. I was disappointed with the film at my age.5/10,Jupiter Ascending
26,KineticSeoul,"Not awful, but easily forgettable",6,30 May 2015,"Despite the special effects and pretty high quality CGI. There just isn't anything that makes this movie stand out. Mainly because the plot is just pretty weak. And seemed like something out of one of those teen romance books where some average chick is put in some sort of extravant and mystical situation with a handsome male lead. Or at least caught in the middle of it all because the chick is either special or comes from a certain bloodline or it's because of the situation. Which is something that has been done before, except this time it's with aliens and sci-fi elements. Now I don't really have a complaint with this types of movies, as long as there is some substance when it comes to the story and characters. Even the dialogue is as generic as it gets from some stereotypical Voldemort like villain saying some generic phrases. And his minions going ""yes, sire it will be done"". Which you won't find much of in this movie. Now this movie isn't entirely bad and it does have it's moments when it comes to certain action sequences and fist fights. I also somewhat liked the visual design of the world and technology. So this is a mix of sci-fi and fantasy elements clashed into one and it's a ambitious movie. But falters in many levels to the point it becomes forgetful. However I was at least relieved that there wasn't any strained or forced romance and it wasn't as awful as some critics claimed it to be. However I would rather watch ""John Carter"" again over watching this again though.6/10",Jupiter Ascending
27,Hellmant,"If you grew up on 80s space opera, you're almost sure to love this movie!",9,11 February 2015,"'JUPITER ASCENDING': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)The new big budget sci-fi epic from the Wachowski siblings. It stars Mila Kunis as a poor caretaker and Channing Tatum as a genetically engineered ex-military warrior, who team up to stop alien royalty from taking over the planet. Andy and Lana Wachowski wrote, co-produced and directed the movie; which also stars Eddie Redmayne, Sean Bean, Douglas Booth and Tuppence Middleton. If you grew up on 80s space opera, like I did, you're almost sure to love this movie (despite what the critics say).The plot revolves around a rich alien family, called the 'House of Abrasax', who harvest people from other planets to create a youth serum; which allows them to live forever. When their mother dies, the Abrasax siblings fight over her inheritance; with Earth being the most prized possession. A poor housekeeper on Earth, named Jupiter Jones (Kunis), is destined to replace the Abrasax siblings, as Queen of Earth, due to her genetic structure. So she's targeted to be killed, by the powerful alien family, and it's up to a genetically engineered hunter, named Caine Wise (Tatum), to save her (and the planet). The film is full of spectacular visuals, cleverly crafted space battles and intense chase sequences. I was most impressed with the very detailed, and elaborate, sci-fi universe; that the Wachowskis created for this movie. For me it's very nostalgic and highly reminiscent of the classic sci-fi action movies I grew up on (like 'STAR WARS' and 'THE LAST STARFIGHTER'); it's not quite up to par with George Lucas's original beloved trilogy, but it's at least in the same league as it's prequels. I know the movie is a bomb, financially speaking, but I really think it could become a popular cult classic and possibly spawn sequels, in the distant future, if enough fans demand it. I'd hate to see the Wachowskis stop getting financing for movies like this, because I think they're some of the best in the business at it!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5es95jIdgR4",Jupiter Ascending
28,Buddy-51,A possible future camp classic?,6,3 March 2015,"A Russian-émigré scrubwoman named Jupiter Jones who's actually the reincarnation of a galactic queen. An elfin-eared, perpetually shirtless Channing Tatum zooming around on hover-boots. A race of genetically-advanced super humans who've achieved eternal youth by harvesting inhabitants of ""lesser"" planets (Earth included) inside the massive, swirling storm on Jupiter. These are just a few of the elements that have found their way into the everything-but-the-kitchen-sink screenplay that Lana and Andy Wachowski (""The Matrix"") have concocted for ""Jupiter Ascending,"" an eclectic sci-fi extravaganza that is just preposterous and goofy enough to be entertaining.Mila Kunis plays the earthbound royal, while Tatum is the human/canine hybrid assigned to protect her from the evil forces dead set on denying her her rightful place on the throne. With eye-popping art direction and computer-generated special effects, the look of the film (even if a bit too derivative of the ""Star Wars"" prequels) is never anything short of spectacular. Meanwhile, the script achieves moments of genuine originality and creativity, even if it frequently appears to be on the verge of collapsing into eye- rolling, giggle-inducing silliness. In fact, the movie is probably a tad too accomplished on a technical level for it to ever achieve the status of a true camp classic (though Kunis' wedding headdress comes pretty darn close).

Sadly, the story was just awful, the acting laughable and it contained far too many elements, characters, locations, devices and subplots to make any connection with the audience. More is not better. Look at Star Trek: completely relatable, great stories, humor, action and sci-fi all wrapped in simple enough stories to bring it back down to our world.But, as much action there was, and how great the FX was, I wanted badly for this film to be over.

30,cherold,Fun popcorn flick with great action sequences and a surprising ability to anger people,8,11 August 2017,"Having been enjoying the Wachowski's Sense8, I thought I would check out some of the movies of theirs that I'd missed. And so, I sat down to watch Jupiter Ascending knowing nothing beyond that it was considered a turkey.I enjoyed it terrifically. The film involves a cleaning lady who finds herself in the midst of a feud among extra terrestrial schemers.The movie is most notable for its excellently-filmed action scenes, such as a wonderful chase sequence involving alien jet fighters and anti-gravity boots. The movie is also visually lush and imaginative, as in a gorgeous wedding scene.The story is nothing original, but it serves as a decent framework for the action, with Mila Kunis appealing as a young woman out of her depth and Channing Tatum making a satisfying action hero. Of particular note is Sean Bean as Tatum's ex-commander. Truthfully, when I saw him I thought he probably should have been cast in Tatum's role, but to be fair, he's too old to be a persuasive love interest (at least in this century).The most surprising thing about the movie, especially after watching Sense8, is how it falls into the white-people-in-outer-space genre. The movie is hugely conventional, as though the Wachowski's hoped that by embracing every convention of blockbusters they could have one. Women are meek, black people are mercenaries or officious bureaucrats, and the main bad guy seems a little gay.Now on to the critics...I was really surprised after watching the movie to see how many people hate it, and even after reading a number of reviews, I still don't get it. So I want to explain where I differ with those critics.""The plot was too convoluted and confusing"": No, it wasn't. Any question I see raised I can either answer or can say it's not germane (someone asked who rebuilt Chicago, for example, but I think ""the all-powerful people with their advanced technology and their many minions"" is plenty of answer). It's basically a palace intrigue story, and as those go it's quite straightforward. I'm confused by the confusion.""Kunis does dumb stuff"": Yes, the young housekeeper who never, I would guess, went to college, sometimes makes sub-optimal decisions while dealing with an elaborate empire she has no information about. I think that's pretty realistic. I think the most unrealistic thing is the smartest thing she does, which is knowing arcane royal codes. How did *that* happen?I suspect most critics of her actions would do no better. And I'm okay with a movie that shows how actual human beings would act in extraordinary circumstances (i.e., overwhelmed and unsure what to do).""The actors were terrible"": I liked Kunis in this and feel she's being underrated (one reviewer, who apparently hadn't seen Black Swan, said she shouldn't do drama). I liked Tatum as well. I thought their chemistry was pretty good. When he was carrying her here and there I felt like they wanted to kiss, so chemistry.As for Eddie Redmayne, I don't get the hate. He wasn't especially memorable, I'll admit, but he was fine.In conclusion: As another reviewer said here, ""what did you people expect?"" This is a light, Star-Wars-inspired action flick that makes no attempt at the profundity that corrosively ate away at the Matrix trilogy. It's just fun. Lighten up.Anyway, I've come to the conclusion that reviews of Wachowski films cannot be trusted. So I'm going to go ahead now and watch Speed Racer now.",Jupiter Ascending

32,Robert_duder,Definite potential but film making ego drives it away,7,8 February 2015,"I sort of knew what to expect going into Jupiter Ascending. Somehow The Matrix Trilogy became this monstrous blockbuster franchise and it enables the Wachowski siblings to do what they want. How long does that continue before we go...okay they got lucky with The Matrix. They haven't done anything spectacular since the first Matrix. The second two films were crap in my opinion. Speed Racers...enough said, Cloud Atlas was a three hour bizarre non-sensical mess. Wachowski's self-admittedly smoke a lot of dope and come up with strange sci-fi concepts that are better in their head or high. Now, all that being said Jupiter Ascending actually has a lot of potential. There is a world here that should have been gradually created and carefully put together with good pacing and character development. Instead as the Wachowski's love to do...they get all excited, cram everything into one movie, use characters and plot points that make no sense and they just couldn't give a lick about pacing or what should be cut or editing or any of that. They think they are movie gods and unfortunately it really hurts their end product. Jupiter Ascending is a bizarre concept anyways (touching on reincarnation and Oedipus complex) but the action scenes are first rate...really well done. The special effects are very good right up until the last moment and the CGI is done quite well considering.Mila Kunis is actually very good in this film. She's definitely the highlight of the film character wise. I would have liked if the script had given her just a little bit more guts because she tends to be damsel in distress a lot despite being ""tough"" as well. Still she is good in the role for what they gave her. She definitely holds the lead well. I used to really not like Channing Tatum but he's growing on me. I think I misjudged him. However, I don't think he was properly cast in this. He's actually okay in the role and I know he's giving it his all but someone a little darker and more mysterious might have been better...maybe an unknown? Tatum and Kunis don't have the right chemistry but it wasn't terrible and the pacing of the film was so off it was hard for them to forge a relationship. The fact that Tatum spent a good part of the action scenes topless for no reason other than to perhaps draw women viewers in annoyed me. If there is a reason for it...then fine I don't care but it was blatant. Eddie Redmaybe was way too bizarre for his own good as the villainous Balem. I don't know what direction they were trying to go in for his character but he was beyond strange and his voice was horribly campy. He lacked good sci-fi villain qualities. Douglas Booth who was sort of the sub-villain, was equally as campy but less irritating than Redmayne. Sean Bean, who is also good, does a solid job as the sidekick/mentor sort of role. The problem is he is very underused and I wanted to see much more from him and Tatum who actually seemed to have good chemistry. I have to briefly mention Maria Doyle Kennedy who has a small role as Kunis' Mom and she was quite good. I love her from Orphan Black and she was decent in this too.Maybe I'm imagining things but one of the coolest things I liked about Jupiter Ascending is that I felt like there were a whole bunch of little nods to other classic sci-fi/action films. Superman, Jurassic Park, Back To The Future, Aliens, Star Wars...I saw tiny little things...mostly just the way they shot certain scenes that I felt was a little nod to those films and if that is the case....well done. I enjoyed it. The problem with the movie is the politics and pacing. We all know how politics can get in the way of a good sci-fi film (Star Wars second trilogy) but they just really focus on it. The saving grace here are the special effects and the action scenes. The shootouts and the hand to hand fighting and the use those wonderful gravity boots all make this a must see for sci-fi fans. The gravity boots almost get used too much but its a nice touch and there are some very cool scenes. If only they had let someone else edit the film rather than relying on their own ego. Unfortunately, it looks like the film is tanking so we won't ever get to return to this Universe. I do think in twenty or thirty years you might see this become more of a cult classic. It was still a good time at the movies. 7/10",Jupiter Ascending

34,A_Different_Drummer,"""I am not your damn mother""",7,11 May 2015,"Weighing in late on this one, so I will just leave a few notes: 1. There is great irony in the fact that the two guys who will go down in film history as re-defining, re-imagining, and (arguably) perfecting the ""heroic narrative"" (in Matrix 1) felt compelled to try to do the very same thing with the ""Perils of Pauline"" narrative. And didn't quite pull it off.2. Notwithstanding this film, and a number of other recent films that use SGI to take the viewer into deep space, in the opinion of this humble reviewer the best recent space opera was Chronicles of Riddick which was not only brilliantly written and directed but consistently ""connected"" with the viewer from scene to scene. This film cannot compare.3. Another irony is that the two young stars Tatum and Kunis have never looked better nor, in my view, given a better performance. Forget the effects. Forget the pyrotechnics. These two ARE the film.4. There are many script problems but none more atonal than the final scene which is so bizarre, so inconsistent, and so off-putting that I will simply mention it quickly and allow new viewers to experience the horror of it entirely on their own.",Jupiter Ascending
35,CuriosityKilledShawn,Uranus Falling,2,30 April 2019,"After charming the knickers off me with Cloud Atlas the Wachowski Brothers/Sisters/Cousins/Uncles/Aunts fall hard on their faces with this turgid, confusing mess. This is the movie equivalent of those manic, chaotic attempts at art drawn in crayon or charcoal on large sheets of paper found on the floor in abandoned insane asylums. This is not a compliment. I cannot possibly imagine what was going on in the heads of the writer/director team when they spewed out the words that formed the screenplay or how they could have approved the final cut as anything remotely resembling coherent. If you were to throw the movie into a shredder and have it come out the other end in a completely different order it would make just as much ""sense"" as the released version.Baby Jupiter is born in a container filled with illegals on a ship bound for the US. She is a girl without a country. She grows up to be Mila Kunis (30 at the time of filming, but looking about 40, somehow) and earns a living scrubbing the insides of toilet bowls. After a mix-up at a fertility clinic she's kidnapped by aliens who want her eggs and...sheesh, I really can't even recite the ""plot"" beyond this point as it made absolutely zero sense. Channing Tatum (back when Hollywood kept trying to make him a thing) shows up as a dog/man with no personality (John Candy he ain't!), some things happen, color and movement fill the screen, words are said, none of it adds up.Eddie Redmayne (who looks like a human skeleton with wafer thin ham super-glued onto it) is the villain of the piece (of crap) and delivers the most mis-played performance in movie history. Tatum completely Seagals his performance and is so comatose he might as well have done is acting asleep while an off-camera team of puppeteers control him with rods and strings. His character is called Cain Wise, btw. Yeah, Cain Wise. Those words don't even go together! Tuppence Middleton appears and disappears. Something to do with bees and Sean Bean. Seriously...I don't have a clue what this movie is supposed to be and I'm a man of noble intelligence.The Wachowskis seem to be under the impression that their action style from The Matrix is still passable or groundbreaking all these years later. It's not, and there's nothing exciting about the chaotic, physically impossible, and weightless action scenes that burn out our patience and kill any chance at further suspense. Though they are not the only ones guilty of this, as this style has continued into many of today's blockbusters and virtually every DCEU and MCU movie. I think that the time to return to real, in-camera action, practical, believable cinematography, and angles chosen for grounded, observable viewpoints is well overdue. From about the 30-minute mark, I could not tell what on Earth (or Jupiter) was going on or what I was looking at. I'm not joking or exaggerating. All I could make out was that Man-Dog repeatedly crashes his ships into things he doesn't like and is seemingly impervious to the vacuum of space.Oh, and having the character called Jupiter and having her actually go to Jupiter is one helluva heavy-handed non-metaphor.",Jupiter Ascending

37,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews...,4,1 June 2015,"​ Jupiter AscendingThe first thing a woman would ask after discovering she's the heir to an alien planet is how much weight will its gravity add.Thankfully, the naïve queen in this sci-fi movie is only named after Jupiter.While a servant on Earth, Jupiter Jones (Mila Kunis) is royalty in outer space, which is why a space prince has sent a hybrid soldier (Channing Tatum) to retrieve her for marriage.However, the prince's brother (Eddie Redmayne) has dispatched his own troops to slay Jupiter before his brother can lay claim to her rule over Earth and its populace, which their race harvests for youth serum.Written and directed by The Wachowskis, Jupiter Ascending is yet another example of the siblings' descending career.Despite some impressive action scenes, the ridiculous storyline, stale acting and incestuous undertones are off-putting.Plus, when you're a space queen it takes all-day to decapitate your multi-headed detractors.Red Lightvidiotreviews.blogspot.ca",Jupiter Ascending
38,851222,Not good,6,17 May 2015,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Jupiter Ascending"" (2015) is a big budget mess. It has the concept, but the story is very poorly executed. Mila Kunis is terrible choice for the part, she's just not there during the whole movie. Eddie Redmayne is kinda terrible here as well, he's a very good actor, doing far from what he is capable of. Channing Tatum is like always, only this time he's some kind of dog / human hybrid - terrible part. The romantic part of the movie where they exchange lines like ""I'm more closer to a dog"" and ""I love dogs!"" are hilariously bad.Overall, ""Jupiter Ascending"" is a movie worth seeing if only there isn't absolutely anything to watch or do and not in a movie theater - save your money. Special effects are not special here at all, they are uninspiring. The movie drags, at running time 1h 58 min you will be watching at your clock more then one, simple because the story is all over the map and uninvolving.",Jupiter Ascending
39,tabuno,A Visually Exciting Sci Fi Action Adventure,7,14 January 2019,"31 March 2015. Jupiter Ascending is a conglomeration of a number of sci fi movies packaged into a epic sci fi adventure thriller. The intermixing of regular earth and the sci fi royal epic theme at the beginning of the movie adds a nice feature from most sci fi movies. Thus, there are elements of royalty DUNE (1984). There are the requisite monster-looking aliens as from Keanu Reeve's horror movie Constantine (2005) or British television rebooted Dr. Who series (2005) or skateboarding moves from Spiderman (2002). There are the requisite battle scenes that echo those of Ender's Game (2013), The Matrix Revolution (2003). And the bureaucracy of the classic sci fi Brazil (1985), swatches of set designs from Blade Runner (1982) and Star Wars: The Revenge of the Sith (2005).While much of this sci fi movie isn't original, there are several scenes that stand out. Mila Kunis offers up some nicely balanced and underplayed comical lines that shine in this sci fi movie as well as other nicely played witty lines from other characters with the similar flavor from the occult horror teenage hit Buffy The Vampire Slayer television series (1997). Perhaps the movie was a bit just too ambition and a bit scattered it all its attempts to be everything. Yet the attempt at the elegant, larger than life royal dynasty angle was almost well played, almost as large a scale as that suggested in Isaac Asimov's Foundation classic sci fi book trilogy (1951-53). This an engaging sci fi movie that's somewhat slow in a few places, but amazing in its visual action pieces though perhaps even almost too much.",Jupiter Ascending
40,ironhorse_iv,Two Words to describe this movie: Jupiter descending,5,22 March 2015,"If you ever wonder what Cinderella meets Star Wars would look like it. It would be this film. This space opera movie is awful. You can tell, by the opening scenes that these two genres don't really match that, well. Directed and written by the Wachowski's siblings, Lana & Andy, the movie tells the story of Jupiter Jones (Mila Kunis), an ordinary maid that finds herself, in the middle of a millennia-old cosmic sibling's rivalry for the control of Earth and its people. It turns out that Jupiter is really the queen of Earth -- and she alone has the power to save mankind and stop the evil House of Abrasax. Without spoiling the movie, too much, I'll be upfront and give the movie, some credit. The movie had potential with its somewhat original sci-fi concept, about a rich alien dynasty wanting to destroy Earth for a youth serum. You can tell the Wachowskis put the time and effort into bringing their space fantasy to life. Lots of world-building, drawing on science, folklore, 1950's pulp sci-fi and religion help create a semi plausible and yet mythic, type of a world. It's has that epic type of a look. After all, the story was partly inspired by Lana's favorite books, the Odyssey and the Wizard of Oz. You get to witness the beautiful CGI visual effects, nice costumes, and grand soundtrack by Michael Giacchino. All of that, makes it, amazing, but sadly, with all that; the concept was still badly delivered. I think the weakest part of the film has to be the acting. Don't get me wrong, I like Mila Kunis, she's beautiful and funny, but she can't act. She has zero feeling in her voice. As Jupiter, she doesn't offers a good balance of naiveté and determination. Her character is very stupid for a supposedly smart person. She always asking questions for things that have already been spoken to her. Wow—how klutzy. She's more a damsel in distress, than a female empowering sci-fi lead. Her character is also very unsympathetic, as the movie made her seem like a bimbo, for allow her eggs to be harvest for money. The hero, wolf-man, alien warrior, Caine Wise (Channing Tatum) is dull. The movie gave his character, a cool, backstory that was rarely touch upon, by the plot. It was kinda a disappointment. Tatum isn't a bad actor, he's just remains stony faced and kinda bland, most of the time, here. For his character, has little to do, besides saving Jupiter, time after time and being force to love Jupiter, despite having little to no connection with each other. He felt like the space version of 2008's Twilight, Edward Cullen, with his dead-like appearance. Tatum looks so sidesplitting bad with the awkward makeup and elf like ears. A lot of people might like his space-like boot skates, but I found them, to be a bit silly. The three villains were very over the top to the point, they were more laughable than sinister. Kalique (Tuppence Middleton) felt more like eye-candy, than anything else. For a villain, she's really doesn't add much to the story, besides speaking exposition. I was really hoping for a bigger part for her. Instead, she kinda felt, not needed. Douglas Booth as Titus was a little better. To his credit, he does play the playboy decently to the degree that the ridiculous writing allowed and overall he seems to have made the best of a bad situation. The idea that he would try to force Jupiter to marriage with him, so that he would gain her inheritance seem a bit dated. That trope clearly has been overdone too death. I felt like it was insulting my intelligent. Balem (Eddie Redmayne), was just awful. His appearance is baffling. His choice of acting is so soft-spoken, that you can barely understand, what he is saying. Supporting characters actors like Sean Bean felt like he was just phoning it in than acting. He clearly looks like he didn't want to be there. All the characters are so shallow and lifeless. They're histories are explained and they clearly have fleshed out back stories, but they feel more like caricatures. Their relationships between them so thin that the various twists and betrayals simply fall flat. Another fault of the movie is the lack of detail to the story, despite hundreds of scenes of long exposition dialogue. There will be tons of head scratching plot-holes. Too many to count. Without spoiling it, there seem to be a lot of important themes and subplots cut from the film, due to executive meddling, like how the movie change the idea of rapturing to harvesting. I guess, they didn't want to angry Catholics. The movie seem to want to tackle a lot of philosophical underlying themes ideas like indulgences and consumerism, but in the end, Jupiter Ascending loses sight of the things that make it interesting, like its views on cosmic identity & what it means to be human. Instead, the movie gives way to sequel baiting. It focus on way too many complex things to put into one movie. The Wachowskis were basically shoveling every character and plot thread they could think of into a single film rather than focusing on one concise narrative that could easily introduce us to a world the way, their previous good film, 1999's The Matrix did. The studio felt that it wasn't that good, enough as a franchise and stopped marketing the movie. It then, resigned it to the Feb. released date, two years after production has wrapped up. The results were as to be expected with this becoming the Wachowskis biggest box-office disaster since 2012's Cloud Atlas and effectively destroying their reputation. Overall: I have to say, this giant of a movie is like the planet; full of gas & nothing really solid. Those contemplating watching Jupiter Ascending has to know, to go in with low expectations to enjoy the film. I really can't recommended watching.",Jupiter Ascending
41,The-Sarkologist,Has everything you expect from a Science-fiction epic,9,4 March 2015,"Well, when the credits began to roll I was not at all surprised to discover that the Wackowskis were the brains behind this film. Okay it is not as existentialist in the way that the Matrix was, nor does it deal with the idea of the reality in which we live as being an illusion, but there are still some very strong religious elements within this film. In a way what this film made me think about was how the uber-wealthy can, in many cases, be almost godlike, yet their human nature pretty much makes them cruel and almost inhuman in character.The film is a story about a girl named Jupiter who was born on a ship crossing the Atlantic as her family was fleeing Russia for the United States. She was not a very exceptional girl, having been brought up in a poor, working class, Russian household and looking for ways to get enough money together to be able to buy herself a telescope – to which her nephew suggests that she have her eggs harvested. However, while she is in the clinic she suddenly discovers that there are people who want her dead, and then discovers that they are aliens. As such a whole new world opens up to her when a genetically engineered soldier comes in and saves her life.This is a great science-fiction film which has space battles, giant star destroyers, and a reasonably detailed intergalactic empire that draws you in to the fantasy. However there are elements of the Cthulu story in it, not that the bad guys are huge monsters with squid like heads (though there are monsters in the film – just no squids), but rather that human life on Earth have been created as cattle for the use of a race of aristocrats that seek eternal life (and they do so through harvesting genes from sentient humans). This race of humans are so scientifically advanced that they have created whole servitor races for their own purposes.As it turns out there is a war between the three children of the royal family, and they behave like most political rulers, that is through the use of lies and deceptions. Further, their hold on technology means that they are able to use it for their own benefits, though their subjects also benefit from it. However they are callous, uncaring, and are only interested in strengthening their power and do this simply by fighting amongst themselves. Planets like Earth, as I have suggested, only exist as farms so that when their population reaches a certain point they invade and harvest the genes.As I mentioned previously, there are elements of the divine in this film, much in the same way that you see it in In Time, and Elysium. There are two classes, the ruling class and everybody else. The ruling class live in luxury and technology has reached a point where they can effectively live forever. However the lower classes have much larger populations than their little clique, which means that they need to establish boundaries so that they are not overrun by them. In Jupiter Ascending, they monitor these planets, and when their population reaches a point that the planet is overcrowded, they invade to prevent them from moving out into the galaxy and potentially threatening their power.It is also an interesting look at medical science, namely that medical science exists purely for the rich to live as long as possible, however those of us in the industrialised West benefit from these advances. Yet there is a problem, and that is that the ruling class simply do not want the lower classes living longer than necessarily, which means that they need to create barriers to prevent them from having access to these technologies. In the United States they do this through unregulated medical costs and very strict criteria for access to health insurance. While Australia still has free healthcare, we can see attempts of the ruling class entering and dismantling it (through the use of expensive health insurance).As I said, this is a great movie, and through this film you can see Wachowski's explore spirituality. Obviously we have Jupiter, who is a Christ figure, rising up and defending the world against these aliens, coming from humble origins, standing up for the weak, and not seeking any glory for herself. However, as great as this film is, I do hope that they do not ruin it the way they ended up ruining The Matrix.",Jupiter Ascending
42,Reno-Rangan,"One liner, somewhat richer, but only a decent entertainer.",7,24 September 2015,"A sci-fantasy directed by the Wachowskis of 'The Matrix' fame. Theirs lowest point ever as the filmmakers, but still not that bad flick. The movie lacked in many areas, and one of those is failing to have at least one stunning fight/war scene. I know it was only the beginning and there will be a sequel, maybe ends as a trilogy, but the story was very weak for an intro movie.Looks like one-liner, precisely to say kind of similar to 'The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy'. I mean in a thin idea, the whole story takes place. Something like a space expedition for a chosen one, hopping from a planet to planet, seeking answers and protection. The title character, Jupiter Jones, played by Mila Kunis, with the help of the Caine Wise (Channing Tatum) takes a risky venture when their lives were threatened. Finding who's behind and other truth brings the end of the narration, which runs for just over a 2 hour.Performances were okay, but kind of doubt their inclusion in the project. Mostly the cast was the younger ones, maybe except, Sean Bean. Many of them are only the recently emerged stars. So it was a big responsibility in a big budget movie and they did it. But the movie should have had at least one senior artist. The graphics were somewhat rich, and again the absence of the quality scenes and stunts lets the movie fall.6½/10",Jupiter Ascending

44,sol-,A menial job does not mean a menial destiny,6,24 December 2015,"Discontent with her life and menial job but too lazy to do anything about it, a Russian-born cleaning lady discovers a newfound zest for life when outer space beings cast her away, claiming that she is a genetic reincarnate of their queen. From such a plot description alone, 'Jupiter Ascending' might sound a tad absurd and the aliens on hand do not help matters; while the prosthetic special effects are remarkable, the creatures look ridiculous and more suited to a comic book with exaggerated, animalistic facial features. The plot is surprisingly lucid though, playing out as a mishmash of 'Harry Potter' and 'The Matrix' as our heroine finds out that she IS special and that it is up to her to save the world as we know it. The film also features some really good ideas -- namely that the dinosaur extinction was brought about by an alien race wishing to populate Earth with humans, and that crop circles and UFO sightings exist for a good reason -- and there is no flawing the visual effects or creative costumes. It is hard not to wonder though whether the film would have worked better at twice the length. The original script was, apparently, 600 pages long and a lot of exposition feels missing as the film plays out as battle after battle ad infinitum with only the occasional dialogue exchange. The film does a surprisingly decent job in the comic relief department though with the protagonist's bickering family and intergalactic crazy bureaucracy reminiscent of 'Brazil'; Terry Gilliam even makes a fun cameo in this section, barely recognisable under heavy facial hair.",Jupiter Ascending
45,tomgillespie2002,It will take something special for the Wachowski's to recover from this,3,11 July 2015,"Ever since 1999's The Matrix have people been waiting for the Wachowski siblings to live up their potential. Although it can be said that their breakthrough hit borrowed heavily from other sources, it was without question unlike anything before seen in mainstream cinema, weaving philosophy and mysticism into a sci-fi loaded with gunplay and kung- fu. Four critical (and two financial) flops later, and we're still waiting. Their latest, Jupiter Ascending, is an intriguing tale of a young Earthling girl caught up in a tug-of-war between three intergalactic royals, but once again the Wachowski's have sacrificed everything in favour of aesthetic, creating a film so devoid of character and logic that you have to wonder if any producer will put faith in them again.Jupiter Jones (Mila Kunis) is a young Russian girl living in America, who scrubs the toilets of her wealthy neighbours for a living. We feel sorry for her because her father was killed before she was born, and she is currently living in the same house as her stereotypical Russian family. Whilst undergoing an operation to remove her eggs to make some quick cash in a money-making scheme with her brother, she is attacked by a group of extra-terrestrial's called 'Keepers'. However, she is saved by the hulking half-man half-wolf soldier Caine Wise (Channing Tatum), who whisks her away to safety and takes her to the home of his former comrade Stinger Apini (Sean Bean).Stinger informs Jupiter that she is indeed royalty, and that she shares the exact genetic make-up of a long-dead matriarch of the powerful Abrasax alien dynasty. Her existence has three siblings - Balem (Eddie Redmayne), Titus (Douglas Booth) and Kalique (Tuppence Middleton) - squabbling over Jupiter, as she unwittingly holds the rights to a huge chunk of space real estate that each of the three feel is their birthright. Earth happens to be a pot of gold to the Abrasax's, as the planet has reached overpopulation and the human race is ripe for harvesting in order to extract a powerful elixir that prolongs the lives of the elite class.For a film that spends so much time delivering exposition, the movie fails to explain itself very well. From start to finish, it feels as if the Wachowski's are spoon-feeding us the hardly complicated plot while building up the familiar messiah subtext and delivering extended CGI action scenes. It's also strange that the two director's, who are capable of writing strong female roles (see 1996's Bound), have written their female protagonist as existing solely to be sent screaming off a cliff, into outer space etc., only to be rescued at the last minute by Wise, the goatee'd, pointy-eared superhero. This happens time and time again to the point that it became laughable, especially in today's age.The cast try their best. Bean somehow comes out of it completely unscathed, and Redmayne - Oscar-winner for The Theory of Everything (2014) - at least stands out, hamming it up to quite ludicrous levels and delivering his sinister lines with a whisper. Tatum is clearly capable of more, but is given little to work with, but Kunis is completely miscast. Her heroine is terribly written, but she looks awkward as a leading lady and unconvincing as a 'chosen one'. It's an empty, boring experience, with the Wachowski's demonstrating little care with the script (""Bee's don't lie,"" - one character says with a straight face), and even less with avoiding lazy plot-holes (it takes one crashed ship to bring down a planetary base?). It will take something special for the Wachowski's to recover from their work over the last 16 years.",Jupiter Ascending
46,cruise01,Great epic science fiction film that delivers the visuals and action.,10,15 June 2020,Jupiter Ascending (5 out of 5 stars).Jupiter Ascending is one of the best sci fi action films that delivers on a epic story and action.

Feeling underwritten and over edited, plots are brought up and abruptly discarded in favor of another action set-piece, of which there are too many, each too long. You'll be grateful for the mecha, just for a break from Tatum's anti-gravity rollerblades, a handy prop given more narrative centrality than its title character, who goes from scrubbing toilets to intergalactic politics while seeming equally baffled by both. And though there are promising moments, Kunis and Tatum exchanging long-suffering looks while navigating red tape that feels like a moment of camaraderie caught by accident—the film never stops feeling apologetic for itself.",Jupiter Ascending
48,eddie_baggins,An over stuffed Sci-Fi turkey of epic proportions,3,6 July 2015,"There's a cry out there ringing loud and more frequent by the hour, a cry that calls for more originality in our increasingly sequel led, comic book and remake centric movie industry but when our collective cry for fresh ideas snares us something like Jupiter Ascending, it must be said that perhaps the studios are depressingly right in their culling of funds and support for such risky new ideas.The Wachowski siblings were once the talk of Hollywood town, the harbingers of the new Sci-Fi age with the Matrix and it's slightly questionable follow ups just the type of ideas that seem somewhat rarer today than they were back in Neo's first adventure in 1999 but these siblings have now fallen victim to a string of flops from the enjoyable yet overstuffed Speed Racer, the misunderstood but not surprising flop Cloud Atlas and now this huge 150 plus million dollar Sci-Fi turkey that could just be the final straw in the Wachowski's ability to be able to secure funding for any further ambitions they may have.With its collection of production delays, release date hold offs and talk of much internal conflict regarding the final product, Jupiter Ascending didn't have an ideal lead up to its release and with its failure to capitalise in any market place both domestic or foreign, along with films like Tomorrowland, this will go down as one of the year's most colossal flops that could just see this wannabe Sci-Fi epic be used as an example for others as to why such money should not be spent on original property ideas which for all us is a very bad thing indeed.Whilst there could be endless debate on the career of the Wachowski siblings, the fall from grace of original filmmaking and the future of Sci-Fi cinema, what makes Jupiter Ascending such a bad film is a collection of elements that combine to create one of the most overblown and underachieving space operas that has ever been created. Filled with endless ideas and possibilities that neither come to fruition or the forefront despite small moments that seem to suggest the film could all of a sudden become something special, Jupiter Ascending never gets its own personality or heart that would've made it the event film both the studio and filmmakers so clearly wanted.From the miscasting of Mila Kunis, the almost laughably made up Channing Tatum, through to Eddie Redmayne's horrendous whispering villain, every character in the Wachowski's journey gets lost in a plot that has everything from human harvesting, alien doctors, impromptu weddings and scenes of gratuitous toilet cleaning yet nothing that makes us care, especially when there is so much confusion amongst all the backstory, side plots and Sci-Fi mumbo-jumbo. With care factor at zero no amount of CGI wizardry can save this overstuffed tale and when Tatum's Caine penchant for flying around on some air skating shoes frequently comes to the forefront, Jupiter Ascending can never become anything more than a showcase for money not well spent.There may just be an audience for Jupiter Ascending out there and perhaps a long life of cult fandom awaits it, but the audience for this film was clearly not at the cinema and for most people like myself, Jupiter Ascending is a shoddily constructed, lazily edited and dire example of why original movie making is quickly becoming a dying art.1 and a half elephant star ship pilots out of 5",Jupiter Ascending

The one thing you need to know about this movie is that the reviews are not lying! With no story (or at least a story that is worth watching and actually making sense) no actual performances, no story line and no interest, the movie is really not worth watching. Some actions scenes are nice, but still not worth it. The story is a mess, the romance is terrible, the acting is terrible as well and the whole thing leaks from everywhere. Maybe the costumes were nice and the make up, though Tatum's beard was weird.

50,leonblackwood,Expected Better! 2/10,2,5 July 2015,"Review: This movie really got on my nerves after a while because the plot was a right mess and it was way too long. The director really over complicated the storyline which made it a drag to watch but it did look great. There was too much going on during the action scenes so the attention to detail wasn't that great and I didn't really find any of the characters that interesting. Anyway, it's about a girl called Jupiter who has a very basic life with her dysfunctional family but she has a unique imagination which gives her hope for the future. Whilst getting on with her day to day life, she gets saved from an alien attack by Caine (Chaning Tatum) who has come to earth to track her down to bring her back to his mysterious planet. Her bloodline marks her to be the next in line to an inheritance that will change the planets forever. Sounds great but it's a total waste of time. The storyline changes from one scene to the next so it's very easy to lose the plot. If you give a damn! Personally, I gave up trying to follow the movie and I ended up falling asleep several times. Tatum is just flying around in his space boots, saving her from the evil doers and you don't really get to see anything about his character, which was the only interesting thing in the whole film. No one seemed that surprised that these Aliens had come to earth, causing so much destruction which made the film seem extremely far fetched and unrealistic. Mila Kunis also didn't seem that surprised about her abilities to change the world and she didn't seem that bothered when she saw her room mate getting abducted by Aliens. Anyway, I really hated the movie and at 2 hours long, it really seemed like it was going on forever. Terrible!Round-Up: Due to a big distribution campaign, this movie was lucky to make a little profit at the box office. From a CGI prospective, it must have looked good in 3D but for entertainment, it really is bad. The movie was made by Lana & Andy Wachowski who brought you the Matrix movies, V for Vendetta, which was also bad, Cloud Atlas, which has to go down as Tom Hanks worse film ever and Speed Racer which has loads of pretty colours but no storyline. After looking at there back catalogue, you can tell that they have complex minds that get a bit carried away after a while. Let's take the Matrix for instance! That's a franchise that started off so well but it ended up to be a right mess by the time that Revolutions came out. They did change cinema with the original Matrix but I think they have become a bit to big for there boots. They tried to cram to much material together in this movie, which is a shame because it did look great. Anyway, Chaning Tatums character could have been played by a monkey because he wasn't allowed to bring any personality to the role. I totally believe that it was the script that limited him to do anything with Caine so I can't really blame him. Mila Kunis just seems to act the same in all of her roles, even though this is a big budget space flick and not one of her usual Rom-Com's, so I didn't find her performance that amazing either. In all, I was very disappointed with the whole project and I won't be rushing to see the sequel, if they ever make one.Budget: $176million Worldwide Gross: $182millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their sci-fi/adventure movies about a hard working girl whose in line to a massive inheritance on another planet. 2/10",Jupiter Ascending
51,TheMovieDiorama,Jupiter Ascending ironically descends into an incomprehensible space opera.,4,16 June 2018,"In an age where blockbusters are either sequels, reboots or part of a cinematic universe, it is absolutely refreshing to witness an ambitious original epic. But this...this was not the way to do it. Before you comment ""this had so many good ideas though!"" I am not reviewing a conceptualised thesis of what the film could've been, I am simply critiquing what was shown to me in the film. It is not my fault that The Wachowski's primarily focused on world building rather than constructing a cohesive story. The story...well...is about Jupiter Jones who discovers she has intergalactic ancestry that dictates her as the rightful owner of Earth. A powerful family attempt to force her to abdicate those rights so that they can harvest people to fuel their genetic industry. C'mon now, give me credit for outlining the plot in two sentences, because sweet lord you need to write a paragraph to explain the surface of the plot. Overstuffed is an understatement, and that will always be The Wachowski's downfall with every film they produce. Their imagination takes over, as if a child was drawing a house and quickly turns it into a fire-breathing apple. Less is more, especially considering the constraints of a restricted runtime and budget. Visually impeccable, I will say that. The futuristic technology, regal architecture and explosive chaos looked majestic. But, when you recruit Mila Kunis and Channing Tatum as your two lead actors, expect chemistry thinner than hydrochloric acid. They were terrible! Munis looked confused all the time and Tatum lacked any emotion. Then we come to Redmayne as one of the antagonists. I...just feel sorry for him. He created life and most certainly destroyed it, as well as his acting credibility. The screenplay was atrocious. Injecting a forced romance amid dialogue that only acts as exposition and plot detailing. There's no time for character development, no time at all!

So even beforehand you could expect interesting visuals, convoluted themes, somewhat bland characters and blazing action sequences. And boy were we right on that regard. It's only the mixture we were wrong about.The main problem with Jupiter Ascending is that The Wachowskis have apparently forgotten how to tell a coherent story. Which is: introduce the characters, make them interesting, introduce the conflict, resolve. In a roughly three act structure, though that's negotiable. According to The Wachowski, however, it's: introduce the world, introduce the world some more, and more, and more, oh and there are some characters, who might act, or they might not, according to some motives we don't really have time to delve too deeply into, because we have so much world building to do. Oh, and explosions. Can't forget those.This baffling lopsidedness is not helped by the blandness of the main actors. Mina Kunis and Channing Tatum have been in good movies, but neither is what you would call charismatic, leading to a situation where the two main characters have no chemistry. Not that the script gives them much to work with. The eponymous Jupiter (Kunis) is especially horrible as a main character as she has no goals of her own, she contributes nothing to the story, other than as a plot device, and by the end of the movie she has learned nothing.What Jupiter Ascending does get right are the visuals. So much time is spent on introducing the world that you're bound to see something interesting most of the time. Sure, they go a bit overboard with the backgrounds which are often so complex and busy that you have no idea what your eyes should focus on. But, the set designs look amazing, the action scenes are actually pretty decent, if a bit shaky, and the various creatures and characters we meet all have a distinct look. Plus there's a pretty neat homage to Terry Gilliam's Brazil in the middle of the movie. Kudos for that.Jupiter Ascending is not a good movie. The Wachowskis clearly have a lot of ideas, but they seem to know how to bring those ideas to life while still telling a coherent and structured story. Plus their characters lack, well, character. The film is worth checking out if you're simply looking for a great visual experience and don't care too much about the characters or the story, but even then there are better movies.",Jupiter Ascending
54,DarkVulcan29,Makes Star Wars:The Phantom Menace almost redeemable,5,15 February 2015,"From the creators of The Matrix film series, comes another sci-fi epic. The effects are pretty descent, some action scenes do keep you on the edge of your seat. The story itself is basically a Cinderella mixed with Star Wars and The Fifth Element. But the rest of the film really pulls itself into nowhere.Mila Kunis never shows much in her role, maybe cause she was not giving much to work with, she comes across kind of bland. Now Channing Tatum is way more interesting, his character looks like Mr. Spock and Star Lord mixed together. He was giving more to work with, and has no chemistry with Kunis. This takes other elements from other sci fi films, that reminds that I should be watching them instead of this. It's more just turn your brain off kind of film, but I'd rather be watching John Carter(2012).",Jupiter Ascending

It a big space opera that had excellent special effects and action sequences that most people would expect from the siblings, but it pales in comparison to the world-building, storytelling, and themes of most of their previous work. The Wachowskis were trying the repeat some of the ideas from The Matrix, i.e. the main character finding out that their reality is a lie and the human race were being farmed. But the world Jupiter Ascending came across as incoherent ramblings with The Wachowskis try to make their own version of Dune.",Jupiter Ascending
56,stevendbeard,"Amazing Effects, Muddled Story",7,6 February 2015,"I saw ""Jupiter Ascending"", starring Mila Kunis-Ted, Forgetting Sarah Marshall; Channing Tatum-White House Down, She's the Man; Eddie Redmayne-The Theory of Everything, Black Death and Sean Bean-Mirror Mirror, Black Death.This is a sci-fi movie directed by the Wachowskis-formerly known as the Wachowski Brothers until Larry became Lana. They made their mark with the Matrix movies, Speed Racer and Cloud Atlas-well, at least with the Matrix movies. Mila plays Jupiter-her father named her after the planet- who is just an ordinary girl that works at an ordinary job, leaning toilets, or at least that is what she thinks. Channing, who is a hybrid of a man and a wolf, shows up on flying gravity boots just in time to save Mila from some creepy little alien creatures that are attacking her. That is when she starts to discover her hidden past and her connection to a screwed up royal family living on the planet Jupiter, that is led by Eddie. Eddie has plans for Mila and Oh Yeah, he also wants to destroy the Earth, after he has used up it's resources. Sean shows up when Channing needs help protecting Mila. Sean and Channing have fought beside each other in the past, so they are war buddies. The visual effects are amazing, as to be expected from the creators of the Matrix but the story was a little muddled; sometimes, it was a little hard to keep it straight as to what was going on and who was a good guy or a bad guy. Maybe after a second viewing it might be clearer. There are a lot of interesting ideas-you learn about what happened to dinosaurs on the Earth-and there are a few things that made me think of some older movies, including Star Wars-the cross breeds of humans with animal heads reminded me of the cantina scenes and the battles in space ships were fast and furious-and also the movie Soylent Green-if you have seen the movie, you know what I'm talking about and if you haven't seen it, Surprise! It's rated ""PG-13"" for violence, sci-fi action and sexual content- partial nudity-and has a running time of 2 hours & 7 minutes. I enjoyed it enough that I would buy it on DVD.",Jupiter Ascending

The plot and characters are just enough to hang the special effects sequences onto.So the plot is that Earth is a farm for super-human aliens to grow people on so that they can be harvested for some kind of immortality juice. Except that Milas Kunis is the reincarnation of one of these Royals, and there are a bunch of political machinations to stop her from claiming her inheritance.Which would have made a LOT more sense IF they had bothered fleshing out characters instead of simply using them to set up the next overly long CGI Action sequence.

But it turns out to be an original movie. Well I say ""original"" it's really just another generic scyfy adventure movie that is familiar to anyone under 40. It tries to cram about four books worth of world building into its run-time so the whole thing feels like a parade of concept art more than a story.Speaking of the story: I'm not sure why exactly but I never felt any real sense of grandiosity or significance. Despite the interplanetary scope of the story and astronomical number of lives presumably at stake, the whole just feels a bit whatever. After the trite opening sequence in which we get a parent-gives-title-character-name-their-late-spouse suggested cliche, Jupiter doesn't really seem to have any real connection to the events happening around except insofar as the narrative insists on telling us. The story mostly seems to just happen TO her in an Alice in Wonderland/Spirited Away type thing, except Alice Liddell was not an utterly forgettable heroin.There's plenty of incidental pleasures: action sequences, futuristic design, the score and all the dialogue overladen with references to this and that can be quite hilarious if you go in with the right attitude.You know how when cartoon characters go to see a science fiction movie and it's the same generic outer space and hover board spiel? Well this is that. A movie that isn't technically that bad, it just has no edge whatsoever.",Jupiter Ascending
60,alindsay-al,A poor sci fi that had potential,3,20 November 2015,"I was interested in this film and now I have seen it and it is a big disappointment. The premise sees an average girl called Jupiter who turns out to be intergalactic royalty. With the help of her protector she has to stop a mad man from harvesting earth. Mila kunis plays jupiter and I found her to be a really boring character. She just hasn't got anything special about her and she was just a really weak female protagonist. channing tatum plays her protector and he was good in this film. I liked the design of his character and he was great in the action scenes. Sean bean plays tatums mentor and he was also good in this film and adds allot to the film. However, eddie redmayne in this film is easily one of the most comically bad performances of 2015. Also the rest of the family members were bland and dull. He was just such a cartoon in this film who had a ridiculous plan and a ridiculously sounding voice. The story of this film is bland and boring, there is nothing unique and it does feel like you have seen it before. The script lacked allot of humour and the drama didn't live up to what it should have been. The best thing about this film is definitely the style of the film. The cgi is all on point and the action scenes are very fast moving and exciting to watch. Overall this film is really not worth a watch.",Jupiter Ascending
61,estebangonzalez10,The comedy exceeds the sci-fi elements in the Wachowskis latest film,6,21 February 2015,"""Your Majesty, I have more in common with a dog than I have with you.""With the exception of Speed Racer and The Matrix Revolutions I have always enjoyed the Wachowskis films and their unique vision. I haven't seen Speed Racer since it was first released, but I have heard a lot of praise for it in recent years so I might need to revisit it soon considering many people have claimed it was way ahead of its time. Jupiter Ascending may be one of their weakest efforts because the plot is messy and convoluted, but the film still looked great and had an underlying sense of humor about it. When I watched the trailer for the first time my high expectations were tamed, but I actually ended up enjoying the movie more than I had anticipated due to the comedy. The Wachowskis have interesting and unique ideas and somewhere in Jupiter Ascending there are some, but the film fails to develop the story. The Wachowskis might have been trying to direct the Star Wars for this generation, but I'm sorry The Guardians of the Galaxy got there first. A lot of critics have claimed the film is so ridiculous that it's unintentionally funny, but I have to disagree. I think they were aiming for a sci-fi comedy that isn't supposed to be taken seriously. The Wachowskis are having a lot of fun with the characters Sean Bean has been playing in the past and he is great here. There are some great hilarious scenes about the bureaucracy in the Universe. There is another one taking place in a space ship involving an elephant man which reminded me of some of the wacky characters that had small roles in Star Wars. Eddie Redmayne is amping it up as a villain and has taken a lot of criticism for his performance, but he too is part of the fun the Wachowskis are having with the film. Everyone is so focused on the incredible Chicago chase scene at the beginning of the film, but I wasn't really blown away by it. What stood out for me was the wacky sense of humor (the bureaucracy scene is my favorite). I may be reading to far into this film, but I felt they were also poking fun of Twilight with the love triangle in the middle of the movie involving the gorgeous Mila Kunis, the very pale looking Douglas Booth, and the dog man Channing Tatum. At times they also reference Beauty and the Beast, and the Terry Gilliam cameo proves they were influenced by his work in Brazil. I haven't spent any time detailing the plot because it is hard to set up this expanded universe. The Wachowskis take their time to introduce this world and set things up. They have some interesting ideas, but they aren't developed too well and the action set pieces take over. This had the potential of being The Fifth Element, but the Wachowskis were aiming a bit higher than that and missed the mark. Channing Tatum and Sean Bean give the best performances in the movie, while Mila Kunis was miscast in my opinion. Eddie Redmayne's talents are also wasted by the way the Wachowskis wanted him to play the character. Jupiter Ascending looks great and the humor got to me, but the sic fi elements weren't that great.

And their Jupiter Ascending isn't just a failure, it's a grand symphony of failure. A spectacular, often dazzling failure. It totally misses its mark, but it aims so high that you're almost tempted to give it a pass for its sheer audacity. Almost.There is so much here that deserves a ""Wow!"", but instead it tends to evoke a ""Huh?"". I was so impressed by its ambition that I found myself wanting to like it, but in the end I didn't. It just never comes together. Never clicks. It doesn't move you so much as assault you and leave you bleeding on the sidewalk.So many of these kinds of overblown tent pole flicks ('Prince of Persia', '47 Ronin' or anything by Michael Bay) feel like the product of the Hollywood assembly line they are, but at least where the Wachowskis are concerned, such films manage to feel personal, and that at least is something.",Jupiter Ascending

The only saving grace was Redmayne who was perfect in his portrayal of a ruthless and evil Balem who unfortunately has limited screen space and should have been given more scenes. The introduction of the characters is also not perfect as some of the characters just vanishes without a trace.Screenplay of the movie is average and uneven and couldn't hold the plot for long.

64,arthur_tafero,Battle of the Queens: Jupiter Ascending,2,31 December 2018,"Almost every actor in this film is under 30. The script is obviously written by someone under 30 as well, because the script is wretched. An evil male queen (similar to the Roman Emperor in ""Quo Vadis"") wants to destroy the good Polish female queen. She is saved by the new acting version of Dolph Lundgren. It is hard to rescue a one star script with 8 star sets and special effects (the art direction, sets, special effects and makeup are outstanding). Unfortunately, there are no actors for the director to direct. The acting is almost as bad as the writing, but it is easy to blame novice actors and actresses for this turkey; they are merely spouting illiterate lines written by an amatuer.
In the first five minutes of the film we hear a line about something that is the most rare thing in the universe. Any A student in English knows that the superlative form of rare is rarest, not most rare. So with an illiterate, adolescent script, the film is doomed from the start. What a shame; the production values are extremely well done (even with the guy on the roller blades (oh, I'm sorry, Air Jordans). We don't get enough of the evil male queen, but we get plenty of the Polish family at the dinner table. We don't get enough of the dinosaur soldiers, but we get too much of an army of skinny people, led by young skinny people. In other words, there is no room for older adults in the future. Good luck with that idea. A subplot love story between Spock on Steroids and the girl from That Seventies Show (dead ringer for her) can't save the film as well. The Shanghai sequence gives me the queasy feeling that there may have been Chinese investors for this film (hence the silly Chinese girl on the aircycle). They may never invest in a Hollywood sci-fi film again. Giant spaceships right out of Battlestar Galactica plus the usual smaller ships from the Star Wars trilogy seem to be fairly ridiculous. The extravagant and interesting visuals and lively music just cannot make up for the lame script. Better viewed with the sound off. It really isn't the worst film of the year (well, maybe for the amount of money spent it is), but it is certainly the worst written major film in the last fifty years.",Jupiter Ascending

Costumes, sets (CG or not), and make-up were all lovingly detailed. But that leads to another problem that many have pointed out: this film is obsessed with world-building and visual detail, but it cares not one iota for the bigger picture.The characters are all forgettable. If some criticize Star Wars for using archetypal characters, then the folks in JA are lower than archetypes, even more one dimensional. Mila Kunis, a talented actress, is wasted on this heroine, who gets kidnapped more than Princess Peach. Channing Tatum is there to be the stone-faced hunk love interest. All the villains range from dull to laughable. The story is like Soylent Green meets Cinderella.The action scenes are horribly staged. Once again, lots of detail, but no big picture.

This story is about a young earth girl, played by Mila Kunis, who lives a plain life cleaning houses, but is destined for bigger things in the universe at large. A queen on another planet dies who happens to be Jupiter's(Mila's character) mom – and they know about her legitimacy to the kingdom so one group wants her dead while another is trying to protect her so she can gain her right to the throne. These two sides are led by brother's(one bad and one good). The good side hires a hunter to rescue her and this hunter initially is focused on the task in an un-emotional way, but Mila's character is obviously attracted to him. The bad side sends creatures who are trying to kill her. There are a couple funny scenes where Jupiter attempts to break thru unsuccessfully with the hunter, but it's a movie so you can expect what eventually will happen. The sets and the graphic designs are the real stars in the movie, and --- in my opinion – is why the movie doesn't quite make the mark. The hunter eventually successfully brings Jupiter back to her planet where she is to be crowned and in a sarcastic and tongue-in-cheek scene she goes thru planetary red tape mimicking our government(this is the best scene of the movie). The rest of the movie infuses very little humor, and a lot of mind-blowing action where the hunter rescues Jupiter over and over again. It all works towards an ""awe"" moment occurring in the last 15 minutes, but by this point the viewer doesn't really care. The ending almost pushes the movie over, but not enough when you realize how you got to this point, unfortunately. Nice attempt at a different type of movie, but there is not quite enough character building and too much video-game type action.

69,3xHCCH,"Generally Entertaining, Thanks to Mila and Channing",7,5 February 2015,"""Jupiter Ascending"" is the latest attempt by the Wachowski siblings Andy and Larry (now Lana), to recover their lost glory after The Matrix phenomenon eventually fizzled out after unsuccessful sequels to the groundbreaking 1999 original. Despite her stellar first name, Jupiter Jones is an ordinary girl. She and her Russian immigrant mother worked as house cleaners for the rich and famous in Chicago. When alien beings try to abduct her, she was rescued by a valiant warrior with flying boots named Cain Wise. Never in her wildest dreams did she expect that she would be involved in an cosmic power struggle for control of Earth itself.Meanwhile, millions of light years away, the three Abrasax siblings -- the power-hungry Balem, the vain Kalique and the hedonistic Titus -- indulge in their power play for control of their own sectors of the universe. For these members of the intergalactic ruling class, planet Earth is a valuable farm of life essences just waiting to be harvested. This film has a 127 minute running time during which it tries to ambitiously build a complex new mythology of a trans-universal order. I am assuming this would be the first episode of a planned franchise, and so its creators really took their time to define its rules and parameters. The worlds they built were fantastic and imaginative, wonders of computer-generated imagery. The elaborate costumes and out- of-the-box production designs are the best features of this film. The action sequences were very well-choreographed and executed. he multitude of characters can get confusing at first, but they had me fascinated, maybe except for the extended family of Jupiter (mostly there for comic relief). The central character of Jupiter Jones, as charmingly played by the lovely Mila Kunis, was engagingly likable. I like the way she delivers her lines, especially the funny, sassy ones. She makes me smile. Her rescuer Cain, as stoically played by athletic Channing Tatum, was gracefully heroic in his action skills. It came to a point though that it already felt a tad repetitive with Cain rescuing Jupiter over and over and over, you knew she was never really in any danger at all. The love angle between the two took a lot of screen time, but the poster did not hide that aspect of the story. I thought they had excellent chemistry together.Sean Bean (best known as Ned Stark in ""The Game of Thrones"") was impressive as the usually reliable Stinger, a good friend and former comrade-at-arms of Cain. Eddie Redmayne (current Oscar nominee for ""The Theory of Everything"") gives a totally over-the-top, breathy-voiced rendition of the main antagonist Balem. Redmayne's performance is one of the more polarizing aspects of this film, as some viewers can totally hate it. The handsome Douglas Booth (recently seen as Romeo in the 2013 film version of the Shakespeare classic) played the shrewd Titus with relish. The beautiful Tuppence Middleton (who was also seen in ""The Imitation Game"") was quite daring with her portrayal of ever-youthful Kalique.Overall, I thought the film was very entertaining, anchored on the charisma of Jupiter and Cain, as played by Kunis and Tatum. The Wachowskis have created another universe, albeit not too original anymore. But I thought the characters of Jupiter and Cain look great together, and I would not mind seeing this pair again in a sequel. 7/10.",Jupiter Ascending
70,aharmas,Would make an excellent pseudo silent movie,6,21 March 2015,"""Jupiter Ascending"" reminds me of those old ""Flash Gordon"" serials. There is so much in it that it demands to be seen in some type of installments or chapters. The characters appear to be sketchy reproductions of something that could have had more potential. They certainly look interesting enough, but there is no development here. There's some type of real-estate scheme, something to deal with distilling serum from organisms, and there were millions of dollars used to create quite a fantastic looking universe, but the film sort of sputters.One element that works against it is the clunky delivery of the lines. It is just silly at times, and at times it goes beyond comprehension. There are moments when a little editing would have helped because it does start inducing some type of catatonia, and it is ironic because the visuals are overstimulating. The leads certainly look like stars, with Kunis looking gorgeous and Channing surprising us with his portrayal of the hybrid super hero. He's certainly becoming quite a talented and versatile actor. Much of the fun is having the humans interact with the different types of aliens, but it's hard to appreciate them because it's like having poorly designed salad made out of the best foods available, yet it just doesn't taste right because the proportions are all wrong.For the longest time I was wondering what the film would be like if properly edited, or if there's another cut, maybe longer that could explain some of the questions one is left pondering about.

71,peterp-450-298716,"Magnificent images from space, but what a terrible story and pitifully poor performances.",3,24 June 2015,"It can be difficult for people from underdeveloped worlds to hear that their planet is not the only inhabited planet.In terms of views and images, ""Jupiter Ascending"" is a spectacle with an impressive space footage, sometimes rousing action sequences and titillating extraterrestrial fantasies. But just as a book of Jack Vance, it really doesn't make any sense in the beginning. The difference is that while reading that book of Vance, the intended message becomes clear to you. With ""Jupiter Ascending"" it's still fairly muddled and incomprehensible in the end and you seem to sink into hotchpotch of futuristic ideas. An epic work that throws together different aspects from other SF classics such as ""Flash Gordon"", ""Star Wars"" and ""Battlestar Galactica"". The added Cinderella fairytale with someone living on earth whose DNA equals that of some space queen, makes it complete.Jupiter Jones (Mila Kunis) is of Russian descent and has to get up early every day to help her mother clean up rich people houses. Every day she plunges the toilet brush in dirty toilets, without realizing that she has identical genes as the deceased matriarch of the house of Abrasax and in that way she's the owner of planet Earth. The house of Abrasax is an alien royal family that owns several planets. These planets serve merely to be harvested so they can produce a youth serum. The remaining heirs Balem (Eddie Redmayne) Kalique (Tuppence Middleton) and Titus (Douglas Booth) only benefit from the disappearance of this earthling. And that's when Caine Wise (Channing Tatum) shows up. Caine, a former soldier, has been instructed to protect Jupiter.The Wachowskis not only experienced a physical (at least one of the two) transformation, but there's also something missing when it comes to creativity because they seem to be unable to match the masterful and groundbreaking ""The Matrix"". Visually ""Jupiter Ascending"" is a masterpiece, but the story is a messy and chaotic whole. The release of the movie was delayed because of certain deficiencies and they still needed to adjust the visual character of the film. That wasn't a good omen in the first place. Especially the characters without depth, the ridiculous dialogues and a forced romantic story make this film pretty weak. I admit that the rescue operation at the beginning of the film in which Caine prevents Jupiter being abducted by alien ""Keepers"", while flying around on his jet-like roller skates, was a breathtaking part that lasted for ages. The flashy chase between the buildings is intense, exciting and masterfully portrayed. But that wasn't the last time he had to save her. The film seems like an endless rescue operation. And after a while those special skates aren't that special anymore.The weakest point of this movie are the characters. Mila Kunis is better than expected but unfortunately it feels as if she's running around the whole movie screaming out loud, while showcasing her ""looks"". Channing has a tough appearance, but soon gets bogged down in an uninspired parody of himself, struggling with his own feelings. The duo eventually ends up as a kind of ""Danny and Sandy in space"" couple. A faint love story about two people from two different space systems. The Abrasax family is also a mishmash that didn't really convince. Tuppence Middleton plays no significant role at all. And Redmayne surprised me completely (after I've seen him shine in ""The theory of everything"") as the wily and cruel Balem who sounded fairly menacing with that whispering voice. Until he starts shouting out of anger and frustrations in a fit. I spontaneously started to chuckle. The only two actors who were convincing were Sean Bean and Douglas Booth. And let's not forget the Russian family sitting together at the dining table. These scenes achieved the highest grade of humorous content.Do you want to be lead away through the infinite universe where you'll experience one surprise after another and become completely bewildered by the brilliant computer graphics (and as I have been told the 3D version is unprecedented) ? Well, then you have to see this epic space story, full of strange creatures, aliens and exotic places. You also like some romantic posturing and a happy ending ? Than you shouldn't miss it either. But are you also wishing for a fascinating story filled with interesting characters, then this will be a huge disappointment. A better alternative is ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" where the mix of all these ingredients doesn't create a bitter aftertaste ! More reviews here : http://bit.ly/1KIdQMT",Jupiter Ascending

Star Wars, The Matrix and Cloud Atlas were all reasonable science fiction films, not so this. It reminded me more of Dune, but it had elements within of Terminator, Phantom Menace, even a smattering of the Fifth Element and probably others too. And of course strip it right down to reveal Buster Crabbe's non-pretentious Flash Gordon. This was a film designed primarily to satisfy little girls' little princess wish fulfilment with Mila Kunis playing Dale, Channing Tatum as Pygar borrowed from Barbarella (cheating with rocket skates) and Eddie Redmayne as Ming.Fed up lady toilet cleaner suddenly discovers that many swift monstrous things from the universe are out to kill her, others to marry her and kill her. Why? Because her recurrent DNA apparently makes her Her Majesty the Queen of Something but also the rightful owner of Earth which is shortly going to be harvested of its human population to ensure the longevity of the current owners. The interesting hypothesis presents itself: will the capitalist owners of the universe of the future value Time more than Money, and will they still be called capitalists? There are other interesting plot possibilities during the film, all sadly thrown away in the drive for debatable spectacle. The cgi cartoon gamer sequences take up the majority of the film but fail to impress – they're generally lame and taken at such a breakneck speed with conflagration in every pixel that it all ends up risibly incomprehensible. I couldn't laugh though in case I felt motion sick.Kunis's character was named Jupiter Jones - which only made me wish Pete Crenshaw and Bob Andrews of the Three Investigators could've made an appearance to find out what was going on here. As usual the good point is that it kept a lot of people in a job but what a wasted opportunity to make something entertaining and worthy of its own longevity! At the end of the movie the owner of planet Earth is back to toilet cleaning, almost Whistling While She Worked and surely about to say There's No Place Like Home! I could've forgiven the waste of time if the end credits had rolled to Chicago My Kind Of Town. Colourful but utterly confusing and non-engaging.",Jupiter Ascending
73,masonsaul,A decent sci-fi movie,6,25 December 2018,"Jupiter Ascending is a decent and enjoyable sci-fi movie with a unique premise. Mila Kunis, Sean Bean and Channing Tatum are all really good.

74,davidmvining,Wow...Just...wow...,2,21 November 2019,"The movie has individual elements that aren't worthless, but the whole thing doesn't come together at all. The individual elements are swamped by awful storytelling, weird and incomplete world building, and a far overcrowded narrative that ends up feeling like an entire trilogy in one.One top of all that are either flat or bizarre performances from literally every actor. People talk about Eddie Redmayne's alternatively whispered and shouted performance, but the one performance that's most sadly flat is Channing Tatum's. As you can see through the pair of 21 Jump Street movies, the man has a certain charisma, charm, and humor about him, but as the half-wolf ex-Space Cop who wants wings, he's a non-entity. It's been obvious that the Wachowskis haven't known how to direct actors since The Matrix, but to see them fail to develop this element of their toolbox as filmmakers over 20 years is disappointing.Sure, the movie looks good. There's quality special effects almost throughout and some striking visual compositions with, apparently, some kind of innovative method to filming an aerial chase over Chicago, but the story is just a confusing mess.Jupiter, our main character, is a happenstantial perfect genetic duplicate of a space queen who's already died. The Space Queen had three children, who are fighting over the inheritance of planets used for harvesting the populations. It's really just poorly conceived and executed Marxist pablum (complete with dialogue about capitalism shitting on the little people). And, on top of all of this, which gets dolled out in droning tones of pure exposition, we have just a plethora of images that never really tie the world together cohesively. We're thrown into the deep end from the beginning, which is an interesting contrast to The Matrix where the strange new world got fed to the audience in palatable chunks that made the reveal intriguing.Probably the most frustrating part of the film is the structure, or what could be called structure. It's quite literally exposition, action scene, exposition, action scene, exposition, Kafkaesque bureaucracy (the single best part of the movie complete with Brazil references and Terry Gilliam), exposition, action scenes to the end. There's not a character that feels alive. There's not a character that feels like they're driving the action, in particular Jupiter who just follows from beginning to end.The idea that some independent producer with a lot of money read the screenplay and said, ""Sure, I'll give you $175 million for this"" is mind-boggling.

76,jadepietro,More Down Than Up,4,25 July 2015,"(Rating: ☆☆ out of 4)This film is not recommended.In brief: Mind-blowing visuals and a mind-numbing plot.GRADE: CIt doesn't take very long for the sci-fi action fantasy film, Jupiter Ascending, to descend into a muddled mess of a movie. With its eye-popping visuals that are mind-blowing to its mind-numbing script that is incoherent and more convoluted than needed, the film (as conceived by the team of writer / directors known as The Wachowskis, Andy and Lana of Matrix's fame) disappoints its intended audience.Overwhelming is the best word to describe this movie-going experience. Excessive is another. Perhaps, the term overkill is even better. The set design and CGI work is spectacular. The Waschowskis are experts are visceral joy and they create worlds that are imaginative and highly detailed. But their film is in vast need of rewrites. The script has characters change alliances without any provocation and they are introduced and then suddenly disappear, only to return later as mere plot devices to move the action along. It just never makes any sense. They are one-dimensional beings caught in a three-dimensional universe. The belabored plot involves cosmic royalty, human egg harvesting, youth serums, and inter-galactic dominance. On another planet, all eyes are on the look-out for a genetic queen who somehow threatens their existence. Back on Earth, we meet the chosen one, our heroine, Jupiter Jones, played by Mila Kunis. A woman of strong Russian stock and a helluva maid, Jupiter trudges through her day cleaning toilets and begrudgingly dreaming about a better life, kinda like Cinderella without the depth. That is, until one day she is rescued by a tall strapping alien soldier named Caine Wise (who isn't), played by Channing Tatum, who literally sweeps her off her feet with his anti-gravitational boots. (These boots were made for flying!) Caine is half-human, half canine, and Mr. Tatum, at least, gets it half right, delivering a dog of a performance. Apparently, Jupiter, though poor, is a Cosmic Queen in her former life and owns Earth, which is a huge dowry for any would-be bride and enough to make her a target for any alien suitor. Ms. Kunis' acting can't even convince us she is human let alone royalty. Both actors defy zero gravity and have zero chemistry to boot.The action sequences are directed with style and a Saturday matinée peril mindset. All of the supporting actors involved have done better work. Sean Bean, Douglas Booth, Gugu Mbatha- Raw, Maria Doyle Kennedy, and especially Eddie Redmayne as the evil Balem, who recites his lines in a low whisper that is more inaudible than menacing. All are wasting their talents in this dud.Jupiter Ascending is a letdown, a film with some visual wonder to fixate upon as it wanders its parallel universes in search of a logical and compelling story to match its grandiose thinking. (Kudos to John Toll's photography and Hugh Bateup's impressive production design.) Alas, the film settles somewhere between ordinary (without the extra added) and just plain dull.Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.comANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com",Jupiter Ascending
77,Seraphion,Nice action and SciFi but there's no wow in it,6,14 February 2015,"Jupiter Jones is a cleaning lady who hates her life. Little does she know but she of royal blood, more precisely, of royal genes. Her cousin persuaded her to sell her eggs under a false name of a friend, and soon disguised aliens try to kill her. At the right moment Caine Wise, the Lycantant ex Legion bounty hunter with flying boots comes to the rescue. He explains to Jupiter that she is in fact of a royal blood and starts to address her as ""Your Majesty"". They get attacked again by those aliens, Keepers, blasting away at Chicago's skyscrapers. Eluding capture, Caine takes Jupiter to see Stinger Apini, another ex Legion who can contact the Aegis, the sort of space cops, to help them get to the planet Ourus. But the Keepers attack again and Caine fails to get to Jupiter on time as she is taken away to a spaceship. The ship actually brings Jupiter to Kalique Abrasax, the second in line for the Abrasax family, ruler of the Abrasax Industries. She explains about Jupiter being the recurrence, reincarnation of her mother, the rightful owner of the planet Earth. Earth now belongs to Balem, the Abrasax's first in line. But Kalique says that her mother's will to bestow it to her own recurrence. She shows that there's a substance named ReCode that can extends human life by rejuvenating old cells with new ones.Caine manages to break in and the Aegis demands Kailque to let Jupiter go, which she obliges. The Aegis takes Jupiter to Ourus where she go through the hectic process to claim her right as the Abrasax queen's recurrence. But after that Stinger betrays them, bringing them to Titus Abrasax, the family's third in line. Titus tricks Jupiter into marrying him and tries to kill Caine. But the Lycantant survives and with the help of the Aegis' and the repentant Stinger he breaks into Titus' ship, preventing the marriage to complete. Caine reveals that it was only Titus' scheme to own Jupiter's right, and killing her after the marriage. But right after that, they find that Balem, who has been trying to kill Jupiter, has kidnapped her family in order to be exchanged for the queen's right over Earth. Jupiter comes to beg him to release them, and he forces her to relinquish her title and rights. She declines knowing that even if Balem doesn't betray her the whole Earth will be annihilated if she agrees. Caine breaks into Balem's fortress, fights Balem's henchmen and rescues Jupiter's family while Jupiter struggles against Balem amid the ruining fortress. Balem eventually falls to his doom and Caine and Jupiter jumps in time to warp away from the exploding fortress generator.Wow, even for me that's a long one to write. Honestly, I first got interested to this movie not knowing it was The Wachowski brothers behind it. I though the action and the futuristic gear on the trailers looked quite nice. The postponed release made my curiosity even higher. But when I learned that this is the work of The Wachowskis, my expectations rose up so high, certainly with The Matrix (1999) in mind as a quite a comparison, especially because the similar SciFi genre.But I really should say that the movie doesn't really satisfy those high hopes, especially with The Matrix (1999), The Wachowskis' biggest hit, as the comparison story-wise. The Matrix pioneered the typical of a movie that most don't understand in a single view due to the utterly great concept paired with nice editing, which now are the typical of great Christopher Nolan movies like Inception and Interstellar. Jupiter Ascending on the other hand only circles back and forth between the forced love interest, the usual damsel-in-distress-and-the-knight-in- shining-armor, and the commonly used royal heirs' power play and politics. This movie looks so very much that it is so forcefully designed to have a sequel. There are just too many underutilized characters and subplots scattered all around the movie. Also there are too many concepts and jargon that are just used as a passing by. The movie borrows so many other concepts from other movies and pop cultures that it feels like it urges the viewers to go and watch those other films first and understands their concept then watch this movie.The action proponents do deliver as the trailers suggested. They are fast paced, agile and luminous with firefights involving anti gravitational moves, a lot of lights, cool futuristic techs and gears. The action sequence above Chicago is the best for me. Too bad that unlike The Matrix, this movie doesn't introduce any new camera angle gimmick for the action scenes. Also the character Caine looks like he prefers the run-and-gun spray-and-pray yet up-close-and-personal way of attacking. Since all the action is under a night or space setting, this makes it very sparkly and shiny with all those CGI laser blasts.The acting overall is a nice one for me. Channing Tatum and Mila Kunis played well enough that their acting didn't fall below their standard performance. Eddie Redmayne did quite well in emanating the ruthlessness of the main villain. Sean Bean is always a good addition to action scenes. It's also quite nice to see middle list actors and actresses in the supporting characters.A 6 out of 10 score is quite a maximum for me to give to this movie. It's still and entertainment, though as you can still see nice action scenes and worthy SciFi visuals. Just be warned of the lack on the story side. Thus for me a recommendation is a no.",Jupiter Ascending
78,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of Jupiter Ascending,6,7 February 2015,"With a bloated budget of over $175 million, a release date that seems to have been delayed by several months, and reviews from the nation's critics that prove to be less than overwhelming, Jupiter Ascending might be destined for doom. I'm here to tell you however, that it's not that bad. At a running time of two hours and change, this is a tighter version of what we have come to expect from the Wachowski siblings (Lana and Andy). Every since they gained worldwide fame via The Matrix, their mantra has been outlandish plot workings, variable themes on a universe that we thought we knew, funky characters explaining themselves through rules or anomalies before taking action, and lush, saturated production values that come off as a little overcooked. ""Ascending"" indeed has these Wachowski trademarks tattooed all over it. But with it, comes less ambition and more informality.Not necessarily taking place in the future but instead frolicking in saucy visual splendor, Jupiter Ascending is a little Fifth Element, a little Star Wars, and a little Guardians of the Galaxy. The story begins by harvesting an uneven contingent between the setting of present day Chicago and the freakish, planetary hesitance of ancient astronauts (you can also call them aliens if you want). Poor Windy City resident and maid to order Jupiter Jones (played by Mila Kunis), is actually heir to all seeded planets in multiple solar systems (who knew). The movie doesn't really explain why but it thrusts her into a world of ruthless dialings who want to kill her and steal her inheritance. Three children from the quote unquote ""House of Abrasax"" are after her. Their names are Balem (played by Eddie Redmayne), Kalique (played by Tuppence Middleton), and Titus (played by Douglas Booth). Only half-man, half-wolf Caine Wise (played by megastar Channing Tatum) can save Jupiter. He's got a special set of skills, big ears, and plenty of shields. To quote a 1998 Foo Fighters song, ""there goes my hero, watch him as he goes"". Nuff said.To my dismay, Jupiter Ascending is probably the easiest film to follow (storywise) in the Wachowski's uncanny arsenal. In terms of the acting, it's hit-or-miss (but in truth, it's mostly hit). Beefcake Tatum as the lead protagonist (and hero), dons an effective British accent and meets the physical demands of his role. His only misstep is that he sometimes overacts as Caine with spas mastic face grimacing. Oh and then there is his hover boarding feet which makes it appear like he's skating away from his enemies. I felt like I was watching Xanadu all over again coupled with a dramatic channeling of Roller Boogie (break out the tube socks people, just kidding). As the antagonist and alien form who wants Earth all to his lonesome, Eddie Redmayne (a newly crowned Oscar nominee) is ominous and creepy playing Balem Abrasax. His eyes alone will give you the heebie jeebies. That leaves Mila Kunis contributing as Jupiter Ascending's weakest asset. She plays the object of supposed royalty and with some truly vague line readings, strains in scene after scene. This is an actress that belongs in a summer romcom or a That '70's Show reunion, not a dramatic sci-fi actioner.Speaking of action scenes, they are abundant in Jupiter Ascending. With other films by the Chicago-born duo, you have to patiently wait for slow buildups and then short payoffs. Not this one. If you revert back to the Wachowski's epic yarn Cloud Atlas, there was a story vignette in it called ""Neo Seoul, 2144"". The laser gun battles featured are similar here in scope and in sound. They are relentless, breakneck, and shot with trigger-happy intensity.Overall though, despite its tantalizing movie poster and the exciting, swashbuckling antics of star Tatum (and even co-star Sean Bean who plays the Han Solo-like, Stinger), nothing can mask the notion that Jupiter Ascending is still just another, all too familiar action adventure. The Wachowskis try to one up every other filmmaker in the realms of costume design, makeup artistry (the characters are way too nasty and funked up for their own good), and good old fashioned visual effects (you gotta wonder that if this flicks bombs, was it worth it to have over 1000 cast and crew members contribute? Just curious). In all honesty, this is preferably hot air from the brother and sister team of mighty Chi town. They take their action packed skit from 2012's Cloud Atlas and stretch it to a full length featurette. Result: Something that ""ascends"" into a gallantly mixed review from me.",Jupiter Ascending
79,Rob_Taylor,Insane love-child of Dune and Flash Gordon,6,29 April 2015,"I have to give the Wachowski's credit for this. The movie is mental in regard to plot, visuals and spectacle and I don't think anyone else could have tried to pull this off and come as near to suceeding as they did.That said, they didn't really succeed. The visuals are at times too overwhelming. There is simply too much to take in visually and at the same time pay attention to what little plot there is.I liked the backstory to the universe and our place in it, but the whole Dune-esque grandeur of the thing was too much.Action-wise, it is fairly well-filled, though much like the Transformers movies, the action does quickly become very ho-hum. It is, essentially, an action blockbuster and that doesn't work well with the intricate setting. In short, though the artists went to town on the visuals, they were merely window-dressing to a weak story that lets the side down. Had the story been more character, rather than action, driven, then I think it would have worked much better.So what about the characters? Well, Channing Tatum's roller blading dog-man is about as generic a strong, silent hero as you can get. Mila Kunis' turn as the toilet-cleaning Queen of a space opera dynasty is serviceable, but again, it is a cookie-cutter character. The nobody-who-turns-out-to-be-somebody routine has been done to death. Sean Bean's minor ""Old war buddy of the hero"" is essentially a waste of a decent actor. Worst of all, however, is Eddie Redmayne's evil emperor routine. Quite apart from the generic bad guy character, he acts really badly here. Real bad. I don't even mean bad like Keifer Sutherland in Pompeii, either. At least Keifer was deliberately overacting. Redmayne is just bad here. A Razzie award contender if ever I saw one.The basic premise also does not sit well with me. Essentially, it postulates that millennia-old beings would not only be concerned with prolonging their lives indefinitely, but want to look beautiful whilst doing it. I have the strongest suspicion that anyone that lived for that long wouldn't give the slightest thought to their appearance. It is difficult to see how such an ancient being would even have the slightest inkling or concern as to such things. They probably wouldn't even understand what it was to be human anymore.With all my ranting, did I enjoy the film though? Well, yes. It was nothing if not different and ambitious. The visuals were a treat, generally and the over-the-top tech and action never stopped. But just as Transformers movies leave me bored to tears, so I was ultimately disappointed with this one. Mainly, it was the terrible characters, but the plot didn't help. Overall, I'd say it was an okay movie to watch. Not good or bad, just... okay.SUMMARY: Over-ambitious homage to movies like Flash Gordon and Dune. Ultimately a failure, but a very shiny one!",Jupiter Ascending
80,yoggwork,all of them are the five dregs of war.,4,19 February 2019,"Except for special effects and the setting of extracting adolescents from human beings, all of them are the five dregs of war.

There was no consistency in the forced appearance of three successors.",Jupiter Ascending
81,bkrauser-81-311064,A Hodge-Podge of Front-loading Intertextualization,7,5 July 2016,"On the one hand Jupiter Ascending is a compendium of sci-fi tropes and influences. The energy is palpable, the visuals when not jarringly all over the place make for something to watch and the acting...well they tried. On the other hand Jupiter Ascending is such a cobbled mess of a movie that the general movie watching public might just as well take a rain check. Seriously, take a hike this movie is not for you.Jupiter Ascending involves an unnecessarily complicated plot which brings to mind the worst parts of 1984's Dune. There's palace intrigue involving the house of Abrasax, a family of genocidal ancient aliens who's three siblings want ownership of planet Earth. There's a hitch in their plans however and that hitch is a singularly disinterested Mila Kunis, an Earthling and housekeeper who can't help wearing makeup to look good for the toilets she cleans. To top it off she's protected by a man-wolf named Caine (Channing Tatum) who skates around in gravity cancelling moon boots. I think that bears repeating...a man-wolf who skates around in gravity cancelling moon boots. Somewhere out there the ghost of Starlight Express is cackling maniacally.The Wachowski siblings have a penchant for front-loading their films with many complex themes and ideas and flashes of visual flare sometimes resulting in brilliance like The Matrix (1999) and the criminally underrated Cloud Atlas (2012). More often than not however their films suffer from philosophical and visual overload a la The Matrix sequels (2003) and Speed Racer (2008). Jupiter Ascending not only falls in the later category I would agree with the consensus that this movie is probably the worst they've made.Coming in with the proper mindset however you may find something to like if not love about Jupiter Ascending. To be sure it may be the best misfire of the 2010's. Say what you will about the Wachowski's later career but when they do something they do it big. This is movie so spectacularly over the top that you just can't help but giggle while choking on Milkduds. Lo in generations to come people may have Jupiter Ascending parties much like they do Troll 2 (1990) and Breakin' 2: Electric Boogaloo (1984) parties (okay there are no Boogaloo parties but dammit there should be). To the unencumbered this movie is a fevered dream; a stream of consciousness tale that shoe-horns every sci-fi trope you can think of.Whether on accidental or on purpose, here's my haul from the sci-fi (and other) Easter egg hunt that is Jupiter Ascending (spoilers):-The cloak and dagger stuff involving the Abrasax and the mysterious crystals has Dune (1982) written all over it. -Many spaceships have a Romulan/Alien (1979) vibe to them. -The completely unnecessary bureaucracy sequence is brought to you by -Brazil (1985) complete with a Terry Gilliam cameo. -The three quarreling siblings are reminiscent of Dostoevsky's ""The Brothers Karamazov."" -An android has a similar name to that of one in Demolition Man (1993). -The mining base on Jupiter is reminiscent of Blade Runner (1982) and by extension Metropolis (1927). -By virtue of Sean Bean being in this movie he brings to mind everything he's been in including Lord of the Rings (2001-2003) and Equilibrium (2002). -Aliens possess mind-erasers a la Men in Black (1997). -Genetic mutations which are mixes of various animals and humans: ""The Island of Dr. Moreau"" -Tuppence Middleton climbing out of a pool all slinky-like: Beowulf (2007) -Eddie Redmayne's incredibly campy performance as the villain; there are so many in mind but I think John Carradine's Billy the Kid Vs. Dracula (1966) comes closest. -The moon boots can be linked to Andrew Lloyd Webber's ""Starlight Express"" but most of the time I was thinking of Napoleon Dynamite (2004). -Dragons...no reference here I just want you to know there be talking dragons in this movie. -A seemingly ordinary hero thrust into a battle of good and evil? Star Wars (1977). -Eugenic-y vibe brought to you by Gattaca (1997). -Caine able to survive hanging on to a spaceship in the vacuum of space while at warp speed? WALL-E (2008). -Caine being jettisoned into space and impossibly saved at the last minute...""Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy."" - Weird incestuous relationship you realize only when you think about it for a little; Star Wars again. -Dude marrying his mother: ""Oedipus Rex"" anyone? -Flash Gordon (1980)...that's all I have to say.Now go forth! Find more Easter eggs if you dare. I will be here pausing Jupiter Ascending frame by frame to pin-point the exact moment the Wachowski siblings realized they dug themselves into the critical and financial hole too deep to get out of.",Jupiter Ascending
82,moviexclusive,It could have been amazing. It could have become a blockbuster franchise. It could have boosted the Wachowskis' careers. But that's all Jupiter Ascending is.,4,4 February 2015,"I'll be upfront and warn those contemplating watching Jupiter Ascending that you need to go in with low expectations to enjoy the film. Unless your idea of what makes a film good is huge explosions, pretty characters prancing around in elaborate costumes and beautiful visuals. After all, who cares about plot, lines and pacing right?Jupiter Ascending is really very much a visual feast but nothing more than that. The action sequences are generally well paced and I applaud the fact that CGI for the actions were kept minimal. The costumes are stunning (as are the actors).Which is a great pity because, on paper, Jupiter Ascending really had potential.For a start, like all sci-fi films, Jupiter Ascending is ambitious in its storytelling. An entirely different reality of an alternative universe with its own ecosystem, species and history is created. There are soldiers spliced with animal DNAs such as Caine (Channing Tatum) who has some wolf in him and Stinger (Sean Bean) who has some bee in him (guess where they got their names from?). There was potential to explore and mine all that richness for more stories but this is undermined by the weak delivery of the first film in what the studios were probably hoping would be a new franchise.While the plot of Jupiter Ascending was hackneyed, it had pretty interesting characters whose backstories would have been fun for the audience to explore. I could have seen the many fanfiction pieces that fans would have spun off from the story of Caine, Jupiter and the Abrasax family. Let's be honest, the basic plot line of The Matrix, the film franchise that the Wachowskis are renowned for, was pretty cliché too – the story of a Chosen One who comes out of nowhere and whose destiny is to save the world. It was the treatment of this plot premise (as well as really cool action sequences and visuals) that made The Matrix such a groundbreaking series. Jupiter Ascending's basic plot premise was this too but the treatment was a complete letdown.The cast is also one that is renowned for not just their good looks but also their ability to act. Somehow though, the directors succeeded in not tapping on that ability. I can't help but wonder what kind of directions Andy and Lana Wachowskis gave Eddie Radmayne for me to give such an exaggerated and overly affected performance as Balem. It reminds me somewhat chillingly of how Natalie Portman almost killed her career with her expressionless and emotionless turn as Amidala in the Stars Wars prequel trilogy. At least Radmayne has The Theory of Everything that is out in the same season and that can probably help cushion the fallout from Jupiter Ascending.To the Wachowskis' credit, Mila Kunis and Channing Tatum have some chemistry. While their performances are not going to garner them any Oscars, they put in decent performances to, I think, ward off any Razzie nominations. It also helps that they are pretty easy on the eye. Apart from these three actors, it is hard to discern the performances put in by the rest of the cast as their characters do not appear to add to the story. It makes it difficult for one to give a fair critique of their performances hence I'll refrain from that here.Jupiter Ascending could also have been one of the few female-led action films that could have been a successful film franchise, showing that when female-led action films succeed, it's not necessarily a quirk. This would have been helpful in Hollywood's evolution (if you haven't figured out from my name, yes, I'm female).It also could have been the film that would have move the Wachowskis' career out of its current state where the siblings are now more renowned for the visual flash and bang in their films rather than the creative storytelling and treatment that was showcased in The Matrix.",Jupiter Ascending

84,Screen_Blitz,Jupiter Ascending is simply a mess,3,11 July 2015,"Mila Kunis plays Jupiter Jones, a woman born at sea under signs of a bright future. She grows up and her life doesn't turn out the way she was hoping for. When Caine (played by Channing Tatum), a genetically engineered hunter arrives on Earth in search of Jupiter, who is the next target of by an otherworldly industry run that uses human for harvesting to create an altering in the cosmos' balance. Eddie Redmayne plays Balem Abrasax, the man who runs the industry. This film is directed by Andy and Lana Wachowski who directed the Matrix franchise. What was supposed to be an exciting sci-fi thrill ride ended up suffering from horrible miscasting, laughable script, and lack of originality.First off, Mila Kunis and Channing Tatum were by far not the right actors for a movie like this, especially as the main characters. Many have seen Kunis in mostly comedies, and she just doesn't seem right for science-fiction thriller. Channing Tatum didn't even good in this either. Secondly, this film borrows so many elements from the Star Wars movies. The worlds' designs looked so similar to what you would find in Star Wars. Even the way the characters are dressed are similar to what you would see in Star Wars. Furthermore, the acting and dialogue is terrible. Some scenes even had me laughing by their cheesy dialogue, one scene in particular where Jupiter nurses Caine's wound while he's driving. Then there were other scenes that were just boring and pointless. The visual effects which are supposed to be the best part of the film aren't even great. The final spaceship battle had countless explosions with fire that was so poorly animated and unrealistic. I have to say that Jupiter Ascending is one of the worst films I have seen this year.

85,Troy_Campbell,An ambitious mess.,4,21 February 2015,"This intergalactic epic is an ambitious muddle of extremes. On the one hand there's the splendid imagery, on the other hand there's everything else. But lets start on a positive note. Delayed from a mid 2014 release to allow the post-production team additional time on the copious computer effects, the extra effort was well worth it. From the strikingly grand space vistas to the awesomely conceived spaceships and otherworldly creatures, the film's visual design – with 100% photo realistic CGI – is intriguing, meticulous and overall spectacular. Unfortunately the plaudits end there. As was similar with their messy and pretentious Matrix sequels, writing/directing duo the Wachowski siblings bite off more narrative and deep significance than they can chew. Revolving around toilet-cleaning Russian immigrant Jupiter Jones (Mila Kunis), whose life changes after meeting hunky alien Caine Wise (Channing Tatum) and being told she owns the Earth (yep), the story is a complete and utter dud. Infusing the plot with a ridiculous amount of seriousness and gobbledegook, the Wachowskis get bogged down in trying to elevate their material from fun to meaningful, subsequently losing most of the fun in the process. Even the action sequences are bland compared to the usual Wachowski standard, with the finale particularly lacklustre and unimaginative. Tatum and Kunis are adequate in their starring roles, although his wounded warrior often enters hokey territory and her rags-to-riches family gal is a little too puppy-dog cute and helpless. Disappointingly, Eddie Redmayne's ludicrously exaggerated villain is unintentionally hilarious as he struggles, Austin Powers style, to CONTROL THE VOLUME OF HIS VOICE. Ultimately, Jupiter Ascending is a frustratingly underwhelming sci-fi yarn that fails to capitalize on its outstanding visuals.",Jupiter Ascending

This movie is a love letter to crazy Moebius inspired sci-fi pulp the likes of which have only been seen in The Incal or extremely scaled down in films like The Fifth Element. There are so many crazy out there ideas and sequences that movie is a whirlwind rush that demands to be experienced. While one could argue that the performances do lean a bit more on the hammier side of the acting spectrum, given the tone and setting of the movie they actually feel quite at home in all the crazy adventures that we're taken through. If you're looking for a movie that's a profound meditation on the human condition and our place in the universe, look elsewhere you'll find none of that nonsense here. But if you are looking for a fun escapist science fantasy that feels like best parts of The Incal and Valerian and Laureline merged with Soylent Green and Dune, this is for you.",Jupiter Ascending
88,brchthethird,"Beneath the visual splendor, it's still irredeemably silly and overly complicated",6,26 June 2015,"This, like EXODUS: GODS AND KINGS, is probably a film that would have benefited from being seen in theaters on the largest screen possible, yet wouldn't have been worth the price of a premium ticket in the first place. It's only because I like the Wachowskis that I even gave this a shot. The plot is equally convoluted as it is clichéd, throwing in everything from fairy tales, science-fiction and space opera. The back story on half of the characters would probably fill several graphic novels, if it weren't for the fact that instead of characters, there are just a bunch of archetypes/stereotypes that function as exposition machines in between visually stunning, but excessive, action sequences. Half the time I was in awe of what was accomplished through VFX/CG, but the other half was spent rolling my eyes and laughing at the ridiculousness of it all. If plot even needs to be addressed at all, Jupiter Jones (Mila Kunis) cleans houses for a living, but finds out that she's more important than she thought. There were moments of respite in between the action, and a few of these is where I thought that the film might be onto something. Then it would switch back to ""whiz, bang, pop"" mode. If there's anything to say in the film's favor, it has some of the best visual effects I've ever seen, and the performances weren't bad. Getting through this was like being beaten into submission at first, but at some point I just gave up and let the film take me on the ride it wanted to give me. No one's going to win any awards for this (except maybe the VFX team), although I see this getting nominated for a few Razzies. The story is just dumb. It's also a piece of history, because this is likely the last big budget that the Wachowskis will ever see. So, why 6/10? Well, I don't feel like putting down the Wachowskis too much since they seemed to have put a lot of work into this. It also can be an interesting watch insofar as you can laugh with your friends at how bonkers the story is. Beyond that, if you weren't already a fan of the Wachowskis or space opera in general, you're better spending your time and money elsewhere.",Jupiter Ascending

It is a sci-fi movie including plot of present and future dwelling story that not understandable by Jupiter Jones (Milla Kunis) and nor by us. So confusing! Why Jupiter called her majesty and if she is so special then she must have a unique power, but she is a normal woman from earth. Two villains from different universe captured her to kill, but every time Caine (Channing Tatum) come and help her, just the story! Not many subplots! Title obtaining and getting award after killing people are new imagination to future. Photography work is good, galaxies, planets, space journey and high tech technologies are attraction of the movie which are covering the weakness of an illogical story. In acting side Mill Kunis did her job well as a confused woman from earth. Sometimes she looks like after married Aishwarya Roy from bollywood. Tatum also perfect in his roughly roll. His flying shoes are a highlighted attraction. Rest are Okays. Background score is also well. Not much recommended. Only if you want to see a sci-fi without any burden on mind then watch this.",Jupiter Ascending
90,blott2319-1,"Good for some laughs at its incompetence, and that's about it",4,30 September 2020,"I don't know what the problem is with the Wachowskis. Perhaps they are the type of directors who only have one really good idea, and they've been coasting on the popularity acquired from The Matrix for years, as they stumble through trying to recapture the magic. Then again, they could be the type of directors who simply can't create a good product after they had great success, because now no one is willing to tell them ""No."" There's even a chance that their one big success was a fluke, and they really should be cinematographers or visual effects artists, and leave the writing/directing to someone else. Whatever the problem may be, Jupiter Ascending is another convoluted pile of ideas that don't congeal into a quality film. I wanted to give this movie the benefit of the doubt, and it does look good. There is a sumptuous quality to the visuals in this film, and even though the staging and script feel like a Star Wars prequel, the scenes still have a look like they were shot on real sets with a more sensible amount of visual effects. Sadly, that's about all the movie has going for it.I think the most frustrating thing about Jupiter Ascending is the protagonist played by Mila Kunis. She does the best with what she's given, but this is a thankless role. She is presented as the heroine of the movie and yet she only does three things for the entire runtime: 1) She is the exposition receiver. There are countless scenes where she simply stands there while the entire universe is mansplained to her by every other character in the film. 2) She is a human MacGuffin and/or damsel in distress. She gets shuffled around against her will between every other character in the film, and it is tedious. Sometimes she's actively resisting it, other times she willingly goes with the flow because she's also somewhat spineless. And, of course she has to fall down a lot so Channing Tatum can continue to rescue her. 3) She is a fashion model. I don't know the last time I saw a movie where a character changed outfits as often as Kunis does in this one. It's so odd to the point that she seems to have a new outfit for every single set piece.The plot of Jupiter Ascending is beyond ridiculous. I'd like to say it didn't make any sense, but they spent so much of the film trying to explain it that eventually you can put the pieces together. Of course the whole genetic reincarnation thing seemed moronic to me, but I could at least comprehend what they were trying to say. The romance with Channing Tatum was awkward, particularly given how his character is described. I mean, we're basically supposed to root for a relationship based on bestiality. Tatum does his usual tough-guy performance with weird makeup and hair applied. Personally, I think he is more entertaining when he's allowed to be a bit humorous, rather than trying to be a serious enforcer all the time. Eddie Redmayne's performance is almost indescribably bad. However, he is one of the elements that made Jupiter Ascending somewhat enjoyable for me. This might be one of the strongest examples in recent cinema history of a movie that is so-bad-it's-good. I did have some fun laughing at this movie and all its insanity. I think that's what I would recommend, is that people who enjoy the so-bad-it's-good genre gather with their friends and watch Jupiter Ascending for some good laughs, because it will provide plenty of those.",Jupiter Ascending

The film jump shifts to the 'present' (our future) in Chicago. In some impossibly rich other world, brothers Balem and Titus spar over opaque issues. Within this context, Earth is an extremely valuable bauble to be 'harvested'; this involves genocidal removal of all inhabitants. Jupiter is at the heart of this, since her DNA somehow blocks all transactions that the brothers quarrel over. In Jupiter's own life, there is little but hard work, poverty, and lack of mobility.Delineation of conflicts: Balem owns Earth, Titus wants it, and Kalique conspires behind them both. Balem is drawn to Jupiter from past associations, but he intends to kill her to free up his harvesting of Earth. Titus hired Caine to find Jupiter and protect her from Balem. Someone has hired Apini; this takes a while to become clear. Jupiter has a lot of lost memories that filter back at odd moments. Worlds collide when Jupiter tries to sell some of her eggs for cash: her DNA is up for analysis.Resolution: The conflicts go on and on, and do eventually resolve. It just takes a long time to get there.-------Most of the film is lovely to watch. The CGI, though ridiculous, is pretty to the eye.Based on the script, I answered the following questions. Whom do I identify with? No one. Whom do I empathise with? Again, no one. Is there a single character that I care about? No. Do I care about the fate of the future Earth? No, this is all clearly fantastical nonsense. Do I care about the society of ultra rich pampered aliens who treat Earth as a coal mine?

Even though the Wachowski's followed up with two disappointing, disjointed and nihilistic sequels, the importance of their accomplishment led one to hope for great things from them in the 21st Century. Alas, whatever talent the Wachowski's promised in the art of storytelling is in no way present in either their next project ""Cloud Atlas"" nor ""Jupiter Ascending"". ""Cloud Atlas,"" which had as much potential as ""The Matrix,"" was ruined by DELIBERATELY unintelligible dialog in the exposition and episodes so short they seemed more like scenes from separate movies. On the other hand, ""Jupiter Ascending"" is ruined by the imposition of more characters (heck, more SPECIES) than a Russian novel, a villain who sounds as if he belongs in an iron lung and unintentionally funny technology (Channing Tatum, in his ""gravity boots"" reminds me of Wilie E. Coyote wearing a product from Acme)and ludicrous, unfunny social commentary on government red tape.

95,RforFilm,A grand production value and awesome effects can't save the badly written Jupiter Ascending from boring descending,4,13 February 2015,"When you get down to the world of science fiction, there are two distinct types of films about space. One are films like Gravity, Interstellar and The Black Hole that give off the size and scope of the universe while making it clear that the Earth is such a precious land that we humans take for granted. We rarely see these kinds of movies because these are visually boring stories, even if the characters are interesting and the philosophical ideas are groundbreaking. These don't seem to click with a mainstream audience the same way it probably would with Neil deGrasse Tyson.The safer route of space, and being the second kind of space movie we see, shows the universe as full of life with planets full of many types of species and advancing technologies. This we see often with Star Wars, Flash Gordon and the recent favorite of mine, Guardians of the Galaxy. The more ""cosmic and awesome"" route is something that I've always preferred as the field is science fiction (emphasis on fiction). Entire franchises have evolved out of these notions, yet few remain iconic. The Wachowski siblings, the same team behind another famous series The Matrix, try to have lighting strike twice with Jupiter Ascending. We open sometime in the past where a Russian couple, are about to give birth to a girl named Jupiter, though the father is killed in a home invasion when robbers shot him. We cut to the modern day where Jupiter (played by Mila Kunis) and her mother have immigrated to America along with the rest of their Russian family as they make a living cleaning homes. She's about to sell her eggs to buy a really nice telescope, but horrors as she realizes that the doctors operating turn out to be aliens trying to kill her. An ex military hunter barges in, gunning down the creatures and telling Jupiter that they need to leave. He introduces himself as Caine Wise (played by Channing Tatum) and starts referring Jupiter as ""his majesty"". After an escape from Chicago, they go to a farm where they meet up with Caine's old friend Stinger (played by Sean Bean). They reveal that the Earth shall belong to Jupiter as she is an heir to space royalty. She's taken into the cosmos and is revealed that the queens children, Balem (played by Eddie Redmayne), Kalique (played by Tuppence Middleton) and Titus (played by Douglas Booth all have different ideas on the humans of earth and who the planet should belong to. Jupiter Ascending has a lot ready to go here. The set design, costumes, and the visual effects all look great here. It all looks large and grand, matching the size of the universe. This is stuff that I could see ranking in the same grounds as Star Wars and Guardians of the Galaxy. But in order for all of that to become memorable, you need a great story along with some likable characters. This has none of that.The journey that Jupiter goes on is a cross between Cinderella and Wizard of Ozin space. This is fine, but the screenplay is really bad here. Rather then becoming a fun road trip story, we get a lot of uninteresting dialogue that mostly consists of ""the great things Jupiter will do for Earth"" and ""what humanity is"". Much of it sounds forced and something that looks better on paper then film format.The acting here is very stiff and wooden. It's ironic that given Eddie Radmayne is nominated for an academy award as his performance is like a cross of a bitter old man and a Doctor Who villain. If none of these humans or aliens ever become excited for fearful of something, then why should I care? It's just kind of boring that begs for better direction.I'll give this four sets of anti-gravity boots out of ten. Jupiter Ascending is a grand idea that's simply too large for one movie. It probably would have better played as a Game of Thrones style show on HBO or Netflix. Even so, the Wachowskis have revealed how their better at directing action then juicy dialogue. Unless their interested in making another Matrix movie, Jupiter Ascending shall only descend the duo further into career doom.",Jupiter Ascending
96,natashabowiepinky,A pile of **** bigger than Jupiter,1,24 February 2015,"When you're six years old, and you're bored... Your mind tends to wander. You invent all kinds of strange worlds in your head, full of mythical creatures fighting each other and fantasy worlds where anything is possible. You may even feel free to regale your parents with some 'unique' illustrations of your childhood infused visions. They'll compliment them, pat you on the head, then probably chuck them in the bin when you're not looking. Hey... You can only fit so much on one fridge.Naturally, as you get older, you tend to grow out of such nonsense... As the realities of work, family and rheumatism rear their ugly head. You may sometimes feel nostalgia for the days when you were suckling on a Chupa Chupa while some badly animated Hanna-Barbera pap was playing on the ol' gogglebox... But let's face it, you can view EVERYTHING through rose-tinted glasses. Best to move on, rather than weep sentimental tears for a 'perfect' time that in all likelihood never existed.I say all this, because while Jupiter Ascending was unfurling itself on the giant screen in front of me, I felt stuck inside the head of that six year old. This particular child has a VERY overactive imagination, and comes up with all manner of convoluted characters, weird worlds and an indecipherable story behind them all. It was just like being part of the cast of Being John Malkovich. No, I don't mean the hilarious comedic scenes where poor Mr Malkovich finds himself dancing in public and saying inappropriate things, completely out of control. I am more referring to the apocalyptic ending... Where the selfish guy played by John Cusack gets his just desserts by getting trapped inside the mind of a little girl, forced to live out eternity as a powerless spectator in her brain.I was that chap last Sunday... And I hadn't even done anything wrong!! Apart from shelling out 9 quid on a movie I ignored the reviews of. Whoops. Anyway, within ten minutes of it beginning, I knew it was going to suck. The storyline was already stupid, the acting was as wooden as Long John Silver's spare leg and the dialogue was so terrible I was starting to miss the static from the broken telly in my lounge. On occasions like this at the cinema, I always have my phone on standby so I can amuse myself with a game of Scrabble or surf the Web during the more tedious parts (Don't worry peeps, the sound is muted and I'm sitting at the back so no-one can see the glare. I'm SO considerate.)Then, a TERRIBLE thing happened. The film not only continued to suck, but reached such levels of sucktitude that even the combined forces of a black hole and all the world's vacuum cleaners couldn't compare to it. From glancing up at the screen every so often, I could surmise that the costumes were so bad a playschool nativity's cast would have been better attired, the special effects were crappy computer generated rubbish which didn't thrill you at all during the oh-so-rare action sequences, and the plot was just as much of an incoherent mish-mash as you'd expect from the mind of a little kid who desperately needs serious therapy and a full course of Ritalin. Difference being, this particular child was given a budget of 200 million dollars to play with. Geez, as a little boy all I got was a couple of pounds and a slap across the face if I said I wasn't eternally grateful. How times change...But what REALLY killed it for me, what REALLY made it the first film I have walked out of in many a moon, what even the distraction of my iPhone failed to conquer was the dialogue. Oh. My. Word. People DO NOT talk like this. No one, in any plane of existence has ever spoken like this. They sounded like robots, learning the English language for the first time. It's embarrassing. Humiliating. Of course, it goes without saying there's no wit to be found anywhere, and the AWFUL delivery by the clearly uninterested actors makes these rabid lines even worse. The cream of the crop for horrible writing has GOT to go to the romantic repartee. It makes Jack and Rose's painful coupling in Titanic sound like Oscar winning stuff (and that screenplay was nominated. No comment) and includes an exchange about a dog which will live long in my memory. And NOT in a good way.Before I made my impromptu exit (About 20 minutes from the end... Who cares) There was one quote which I thought I could reference in my review. It was something like "" Humanity values time above everything else"" (though imagine it said with MUCH more pomposity and portentousness ). Well, that's one thing me and the kiddy writer here can agree on. In other words: Go do something else instead. ANYTHING else. Yes, even listen to a Jethro Tull album. If that doesn't put into perspective just how GOD ABYSMAL this **** was, I don't know what does. 0/10 P.S Just to end on a happy note... I won my game of Scrabble later. HUZZAH!!",Jupiter Ascending

So it is to outer space to claim her royal heritage but her newfound ascendancy to the throne threatens the power balance among three royal siblings each more overacted than the last. Can she and her half human half dog companion/love interest defeat the other royals and win the day?Let's talk about John Carter for a minute, the movie, not some presidential sibling you never heard off, John Carter was a major tent pole film that cost a fortune to make that no one actually showed up to the theater to watch. The reviews were mediocre and toys filled the shelves of Big Lots unsold.Then a funny thing happened people started watching it on their favorite streaming service. And they kind of liked it. It was flawed and derivative but it also had a big budget that was on the screen and fun action beats with good looking people riding to the rescue of other good looking people. In other words, it wasn't an unpleasant watch. It was stupid and confusing but fun.Jupiter Ascending shares a lot in common with John Carter. It had an even worse box office performance and even harsher reviews. Yet I admit I had fun watching it. Very stupid fun but fun nevertheless. There is also a hidden side to Jupiter Ascending that even John Carter didn't have. It is clear that there is a very good three-hour film out there that was chopped down to two hours. There are parts of this film that as a standalone are as brilliant and imaginative as anything you will see.Let's talk about what works (kind off). The Wachowski siblings have generated an interesting tale and very good world building with a theme that would be familiar to any Matrix aficionados. The world building is often done organically where the audience is supposed to just watch and hope the details are filled in again later. Eventually, everything comes together in an admittedly confusing mess. Don't think too hard and enjoy the ride is definitely top advice for watching this.There is a rather long tribute to the movie Brazil in the middle of this film. It is completely out of the tone of the rest of the movie and it is truly out of left field. It is also easily the most entertaining part of the film. I have to admire that they cut so much plot and character development but managed to leave this in here.Some of the acting is actually quite good plus it has Sean Bean going well full Sean Bean. That alone makes the film that much more watchable.Okay, so what went wrong? Well, we only have time for a few highlights cause this is a very long list.If I see one more movie where the lead character finds out they are the mystical chosen one through no actions of their own I am shooting the TV. I have no problems, in theory, of the love interest rescuing the damsel in distress but good lord this movie does it every twenty minutes. Not to mention he, of course, rescues her at the last possible second. It is as if we were watching a dozen James Bond defusing the bomb endings strung together.Channing Tatum does a fine job as the errant knight to Mila Kunis's princess but making him a half human half dog was shall we say is an interesting hurdle in the film. You are a better person than I if your mind didn't go immediately to John Candy's half human half dog character in Spaceballs. Then they go on to explain that Channing Tatum's character is a bad boy who has lost his pack and he was court-martialed cause he was a biter. Did Wes Anderson write Isle of Dogs after screening this film? Channing plays his character as someone who is loyal and protecting his master rather than a traditional love interest. Mila, on the other hand, is clearly smitten and declares it will work out cause she loves dogs. I guess Mila will be packing a jar of peanut butter for the honeymoon.And now to the highlight of the awfulness. Not since Halle Berry put on a catsuit has an Oscar winner given such an awful performance in such close proximity to their Oscar win. Actually, scratch that. Catwoman may be a worse film than Jupiter Ascending but Eddie Redmayne's performance blows Halle Berry out of the water. How bad is it? He won the Razzie... in a year that had both Pixels and Fifty Shades of Grey. The man beat out Kevin James for God's sake. He apparently is doing a Drunk William Shatner imitating Marlon Brando's Godfather. I am on the record for not liking Eddie Redmayne in movies. He is one of those actors that just rubs my rhubarb the wrong way. But I am on the cusp of changing my mind. He is so awful here it is mesmerizing. To paraphrase Tropic Thunder you never go full Shatner.I haven't even begun to scratch the surface of course but the bottom line was I actually enjoyed myself. It is clear that there was a lot of great world building that didn't make the screen and there will be no sequels forthcoming. But don't be surprised if this is a cult classic twenty years from now. There is just enough crazy to keep things interesting.",Jupiter Ascending

The CGI is flawless; the management of it is not.The basic story is interesting but so full of plot holes and hard-to-swallow elements that it fails to achieve its potential. Really, with the basic story plot this could have been a classic if directed properly. It fails on that scope. But it does hold attention all the way through and has a few good dramatic elements. The last-minute saves are pretty much through the roof and highly predictable.It does suffer greatly from ""professional assassins and soldiers can't hit the side of a barn"" syndrome. After this movie maybe they can get jobs as Storm Troopers.But if one is looking for an action movie and isn't expecting cerebral fiction, it serves as a popcorn flick.

It has some very lovely visuals and pictures in it and almost good piece of pulpy sci-fi plotting, but what it comes down to is, that it's also terribly boring mess, that doesn't seem to know what it wants to be: a twilight style romance, an adventure, socio-political commentary, Star Wars pastiche. It has elements from everything, including some whimsical things that remind of Terry Gilliam (with the man actually playing a role in said bit), but nothing really holds intact.The biggest problems, alongside the acting done by most of the lead actors, not least by Redmayne with his croaking villain Balem, is the plot and the action. The plot revolves around universe scale industry where humans are harvested as resource for products that lengthen life. Earth is such a planet. Jupiter herself is some incarnation of a dead queen, who owned Earth. She can stop that from happening.I mean, the plot by itself is simple. You'd think that would serve for a decent movie. But no. It's just so stuffed with things, that don't go any where and with characters you're supposed to care, but can't as you have very little idea who they are and why you should care.When I think about it, the movie feels like it has a compressed plot from several other movies. This leads into situations where you feel like you something important was left out. Some one was left introduced and suddenly you see that someone and think why that someone is in focus for the rest of the story.Also the action scenes are problematic: it's almost impossible to think the scenes were directed by same people who directed the Matrix. Almost all action scenes feel overdrawn, dull and predictable. Almost all scenes are built by the numbers style and nothing about them comes as a surprise. They flow forward in a predictable fashion and nothing really seems to be at stake, especially because there's one too many ""close call for main heroes"" type of bits.So yeah. Jupiter Ascending is almost a good movie. It's just a damned shame the makers of it didn't really seem to know how to make it one.",Jupiter Ascending
104,Likes_Ninjas90,"The film is deeply cynical about its special effects, which are employed to deter us from the poor script and performances",4,25 February 2015,"Due to the sophistication of computer generated images it's a misconception that special effects are a modern facet of filmmaking. Special effects are arguably the oldest component of the medium. By their nature the camera and the edited film are designed to forge, project and manipulate images and illusions onto the audience. Imagining outer space through cinema and special effects is one of its longest traditions. One of the first films ever made was Georges Melies' A Trip To the Moon (1902) where a group of scientists explored the planet and fought aliens. The film used illusions and filmmaking techniques like jump cuts, smoke and camera tricks before people understood their purpose. In contemporary cinema no film, outside of Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey, has been as influential as the original Star Wars' (1977) use of visual effects. To build an alternate galaxy of aliens, planet and spaceships, George Lucas photographed tiny models and the world was entirely coherent and believable while still rich in fantasy. The special effects supported the narrative rather than substituting it. Some modern filmmakers today show the value of selectively using special effects: Christopher Nolan (The Dark Knight, Inception) employs mostly practical stunt work and only resorts to CGI when necessary. Contrastingly, Alfonso Cuaron's Gravity was entirely supported by special effects to present space in a way we've never seen before it and couldn't have been made without them.The influence of Star Wars extends into a nostalgic dream where filmmakers, like Lucas and Steven Spielberg before them, draw from their childhood to create cinema. But is there an age where filmmakers outgrow this? The directors of Jupiter Ascending Lana and Andy Wachowski are forty-nine and forty-seven respectively and their filmography (Bound, The Matrix trilogy, Speed Racer, Cloud Atlas) continues paying homage to geek culture they grew up with such as gangster and kung fu films, comic books and anime shows. Their hyperactive film style is simultaneously retro and modern, combining old pop staples with adolescent video game aesthetics. Bound (1996) is their first and smallest film and perhaps their best. It was a tight exercise in creating tension in a limited space. Since then, their films have become bloated, silly and undisciplined because they're cornered into making childhood fanfare, redressed and overstuffed for twitchy modern audience.These habits aren't rectified with Jupiter Ascending. The specifics of the plot and the universe's fiction, including but not limited to spaceships, dinosaurs, flying motorcycles, and human harvesting, are incoherent and meaningless. Broadly, it's a rescue the princess story, the regressiveness of which is genuinely surprising for the Wachowskis. Normally, they include powerful females like Trinity from The Matrix who also appear slightly androgynous. I've been fascinated at how Lana Wachowski's transition filters into their characters that possess avatars or transcend their human bodies. Disappointingly, Mila Kunis (Friends with Benefits, Ted) is miscast as Jupiter Jones, a bland heroine who's a housekeeper but believed to be a princess from another planet. It's surprising how passive her character is throughout the film. She relies on Caine Wise (Channing Tatum), a half Lycan and half human with special flying boots, to rescue her numerous times.The film is deeply cynical about its special effects, which are employed to deter us from the poor script and performances. Barely a scene passes without a computer generated image or laughably overwrought costumes and makeup. None of its excess enhances the action sequences either. In an early aerial battle between Caine and some alien ships it's impossible to identify anyone. Neither Kunis nor Tatum can draw any range from their roles or build chemistry. Her character doesn't appear affected enough by what she's seen and Tatum, excellent in Foxcatcher recently, has too few lines to develop a personality. The tin ear dialogue is lumpy exposition or plain silly. During one unintentionally hilarious romantic scene Caine rejects Jupiter's advances by saying: ""I have more in common with a dog than I have with you"" and she replies: ""I love dogs. I've always loved dogs"".Are you feeling the heat yet from reading that claptrap? It gets worse. Eddie Redmayne, who might win an Oscar shortly for The Theory of Everything, gives an embarrassing performance as a villain whose whispering elderly voice is supposed to sound scary like Lord Voldemort but brings no danger only laughs. Due to these uninspired performances and the poor script, the film is a waste of time and literally space. It overproduces and overinflates one of cinema's oldest and most fascinating concepts: the alternate universe where films are meant to take us to new worlds but not make us feel like we'd rather be elsewhere.",Jupiter Ascending
105,griffolyon12,"Movie Review: ""Jupiter Ascending""",5,7 February 2015,"The Wachowskis' struck gold with The Matrix, but their latest sci-fi film, Jupiter Ascending, just lacks a lot of what made their Matrix trilogy so remarkable. The film tells the story of Jupiter Jones, a maid in Chicago played by Mila Kunis, who is rescued from alien assassins by Channing Tatum on hover roller skates because the genes in her body make her the owner of the Earth. Okay, that's the thing that Jupiter Ascending does all too often, it just doesn't make a whole lot of sense. I am always for original scripts not based off of pre-existing properties, but this movie was a hodge podge of ideas, that are all intriguing on the surface, but never gel to make a cohesive whole. Channing Tatum's character, Caine, never really has much of a personality, and Mila Kunis is basically playing herself as Jupiter, which is fine, but she isn't all that believable either at selling the weird concepts of the film. Then there's the focus on the politics of why the Earth is so important, as is shown through these three super wealthy alien siblings who are all wanting to kill Jupiter and take ownership of the Earth in their own ways. I'll just say it, Jupiter Ascending will probably scratch the itch if you want to see some pretty special effects action sequences, but don't expect a story and characters that you will fall in love with. There is just a flatness to everything. All style and idea, with no humanity. The romance that supposedly drives Jupiter and Caine is completely unbelievable in how quickly they fall in love and that makes it impossible to buy into. Ultimately, the movie just took itself too seriously and never really allowed for much humor. A movie like this would have been so much better had they just kind of turned it into a bit of a Guardians of the Galaxy-type comedy/action hybrid. We need the characters to take their situations seriously, but if they're making jokes while in the thick of the serious moments, it allows us as the audience to have fun and not be bored. This is something too many blockbusters fail to grasp and it's the main reason I think Jupiter Ascending just doesn't work.I give Jupiter Ascending a 5 out of 10!",Jupiter Ascending
106,0w0,"Has an idiot for a protagonist, but it's still a nice movie",6,27 September 2019,"They make Mila Kunis' character out to be a sentimental idiot, who's willing to sacrifice THE ENTIRE HUMAN RACE, for her family of 5 people... The fact that they writers/director even allowed the plot to go into that direction and allowed Mila Kunis' character to ponder that decision, is a travesty. No human should be shown to be so idiotically dull-minded, as to contemplate the destruction of the human race, just to protect themselves or their family.With that massive flub of a plot hole out of the way; was the movie actually good?: Yeah it's a cool way to keep yourself entertained for 2hrs... I'd really compare it to the Valerian movie, as it's actually very similar. So if you liked the Valerian movie, then you'll probably like this movie as well. There's LOTS of good CGI and lots of action.",Jupiter Ascending
107,CANpatbuck3664,I Enjoyed It But I See Where The Criticism Comes From,7,9 February 2016,"All the buzz I heard before going to see this movie was pretty bad. From the reactions at the early screenings and the first batch of reviews, people slammed the movie for being incoherent and failing because it was over-ambitious. I decided to see it anyway and I was surprised that in the end I liked it. I would be willing to recommend it, if expectations are lowered.*Minor Spoilers Ahead* We are introduced to this story by our protagonist Jupiter Jones (Mila Kunis). We see the meeting of her parents Maximilian (James D'Arcy) and Aleksa (Maria Doyle Kennedy). They have little in common but they fall in love. He is an academic and is fascinated by the universe. When Aleksa becomes pregnant, Maximilian wants to name the baby Jupiter as Jupiter is the centre of the galaxy and Jupiter will be the centre of their new world. Aleksa isn't crazy about the name but they are then victims of a home invasion and Maximilian is killed. After his untimely death, Aleksa immigrates to the U.S.A. (it's assumed illegally but it's not verified) and Jupiter is born en route. The baby is named Jupiter in memory of Max.We then meet modern day Jupiter, she is a cleaning lady and she helps run a cleaning business with her mom and other women in her family. They all live together and while they seem to be doing okay, their living conditions suggest otherwise. Jupiter gets very little for herself and wishes for a different life but seems resigned to her position. Unknown to her, she is a very important person and through the process of genetic reincarnation, she is a member of the powerful Abrasax family who own entire planets. A mercenary named Caine (Channing Tatum) has been dispatched to Earth to find out more about her and to bring her to her family. She could help them sort out who she is and to help decide who should own the Earth (it is in possession of the Abrasax family).It's hard not to begin a review about this movie without talking about how impressive the visuals are. There was obviously a lot of money put into the CGI for Jupiter Ascending and it pays off. Everything looks gorgeous and the Wachowskis obviously still haven't lost their touch for creating visually stunning, big budget science fiction.Their knack for interesting ideas hasn't left them either. This movie is almost ambitious to a fault but there is interesting stuff here. I don't want to get into spoiler territory but while some things in the movie might not be completely new, they were cool to see. There are plenty of new worlds and new alien creatures and there's even a Game of Thrones feeling with all of the family conflict . I'm willing to admit I was wrapped up in Jupiter Ascending and I enjoyed it a lot more than I thought I would.Even though I liked Jupiter Ascending, there are parts where it falls flat and doesn't measure up. The acting is very uneven and I was surprised that the cast was so all over the place considering the calibre of actors that the Wachowskis had assembled. The worst offender is Eddie Redmayne who isn't a bad actor but his performance is really overdone and with everyone else playing it fairly low key, he's made to look even worse. Mila Kunis was the other side of the scale, she was very laid back and I think it would have helped if she was more expressive. She's more than capable of carrying this movie, she's a leading lady calibre actress but maybe she was miscast here. I think Channing Tatum is the standout, he's definitely got the skills for this kind of work. He sells it even with how outlandish his character is. Sean Bean is good in his small role. Tuppence and Douglas are fine but their performances are sometimes undercut by some of the goofier dialogue.The other misfire is that while I think that the Wachowskis did an admirable job of setting up this big universe through the excellent visuals and the interesting ideas, the plot is handled in a messy way. Characters are introduced and then go missing (we get an interesting scene between Kalique and Jupiter and then Kalique disappears from the rest of the movie), important concepts seem confusing (I liked that Jupiter could be a reincarnated version of the Abrasax kids' mom but why does Balem keep calling Jupiter ""mother"" when it's clearly explained they are not the same person?) and the flow of the story turns on some random stuff (the idea that bees follow her because she is royalty looks cool visually but it doesn't work in the narrative sense). If I had to guess, I think the team behind this movie was more interested in building this universe than making sure the story was 100% cohesive.While I haven't covered everything, the rest of the film is a mixed bag. The romantic plot is okay but a lot of the background characters are just standard types (most of Jupiter's family are run of the mill jerks). I liked this movie more than I didn't and I would count it as a pleasant surprise. I'm not an apologist for Jupiter Ascending though, it has problems. I think the script for this movie could have used more thorough rewrites and some more attention toward making it flow better as the big budget blockbuster success it should have been. It's too bad as this movie had tons of potential but be wary of people telling you that this movie has nothing to offer, there's plenty here, it's just not the complete package we all wanted.",Jupiter Ascending
108,Antagonisten,Utter nonsense,3,9 May 2015,"I like science-fiction, and by doing that I implicitly accept a certain degree of nonsense in movies. It is seldom that an SF-movie is on the spot throughout, there is usually a level of nonsense that you just have to buy in order to watch it. And usually, I don't mind. But when the degree of nonsense is so large that it blocks out everything else, we have a bit of a problem.Jupiter Ascending starts feeling like the trailer of a proper movie. Characters are introduced very briefly, talk, cut, talk, cut. Spaceships, a man with boots that can fly, people start shooting at each other. Meanwhile, it's very unclear what is actually going on. I can imagine that this movie made about as much sense at a five-minute pitch as it does watching the whole thing. ""There are aliens close by, and they like have these noble houses, and they fight for power, and this cleaning lady is like a princess and, and..."". I almost immediately felt that this was ""by 12-year old's, for 12-year old's"". I can imagine kids having a lot of fun with this, maybe they don't mind the plot being one giant hole.A lot of the time watching this gives you the tiresome feeling of watching a video-game where you are not at the controls. The likeness to a video-game stops there though, they are usually a lot more well-written and cohesive.By now I guess you've understood that I didn't enjoy this. Not one bit. Honestly, the Wachowski-siblings need to take a step back and think about what they're doing. They're all over the place, mixing really good movies with trash like this one. Not even the action-scenes are acceptable, and that feels a bit like their backyard. Honestly, spend your time with something else.",Jupiter Ascending
109,Laakbaar,Enjoyable space romp,8,22 February 2015,"Thank god I paid no heed to the nay-sayers and decided to see this film. If you enjoy imaginative, visually beautiful and rollicking space romps, this is one that will have you on the edge of your seat from beginning to end. All you can do really is strap yourself in and enjoy the ride.This is the kind of fantastic science fiction movie I have loved seeing since I was a kid. Yes, it's Flash Gordon on steroids. I've read a few of the other reviews, but the negative reviews are mystifying and enraging, both from the professional critics and from internet amateurs. I would so much prefer to go to a movie like this than a dreary Marvel-based film.The movie builds on the legacy of other similar films (difficult to avoid nowadays) but it pushes the envelope and the movie goer is treated to ideas, concepts and imagined technology that have not been shown on the screen before. It's a big epic film introducing a new universe, so it's a little confusing at the start, but it doesn't take long to get into it. The characters are all striking and larger than life.Is it a perfect movie? No. It was a bit too much like a video game. Did I enjoy it immensely? Yes!

110,billygoat1071,Over-explaining the Concept,5,14 February 2015,"Jupiter Ascending is The Wachoskis' latest attempt of creating another big franchise as they did with The Matrix. It has the same trope: a world beyond than what they first thought of, a hero with a greater destiny, and even the idea of turning lives into the enemy's consumption (batteries/serum.) But instead of jacking into digital worlds and defeating singularities, this film takes us into an intergalactic world with strange creatures, snazzy devices and weaponry, and oppressed politics. While it's undeniably intriguing, the movie suffers by relying too much on verbal expositions and a nearly inert storyline that actually doesn't let the mythology grow. Even with those gorgeous special effects and some exciting action scenes, Jupiter Ascending fails to replicate the same glory of the last franchise these directors once made.While it's surrounded by cool visuals and sets up a grand action sequence every ten minutes or so, most of the film is run by expositions. When there's nothing exploding on screen, we are stuck with the characters explaining the plot and the world around them. It takes a lot of time talking, but there wasn't any room for character development, either. The script is all there trying to tell the audience what's happening and it even has long lectures about the process of how the royalties handle their inherited planets. Jupiter Jones is basically just jumping into each of them, having the same exposition and leads to the same trouble with Caine Wise saving her. It's just repeating the situation, except of course, they're in a different place and confronting a different villain.But the Wachowskis still manages to create such exciting action scenes. With a thrilling sequence at Chicago and more chases in space, so on. These are the only scenes where the movie earns momentum, the directors finding breathtaking ways to join us along with these large scale spectacles. The movie looks great in 3D, maybe the only way to tolerate its excessive explanations of the premise. The acting is alright, Mila Kunis may not be everyone's first choice to play a destined hero like this. Though, the movie mostly uses her as someone who listens to these orders and a tool of gaining the chance for power, than doing something actually heroic. But she smirks and awkwardly reacts at these weirdness which somewhat goes beyond what these protagonists are commonly designed for. Channing Tatum doesn't get to do much either other than being the protector of Jones and the underestimated hero, but he does well in both sides, anyway.Eye candiness is all what Jupiter Ascending can do best, the plot is pretty much just explaining what happened before and what will happen next. It hardly does anything more than spitting things out while goes through the same peril. It seemingly wants to feel deep about the concept of placing corrupt business dynasties into space opera. It may sound cool, but what it mostly does is expositions. The only action we get is space battles and playing with visual effects. The movie is pretty much stuck at being a generic blockbuster, though it is one of the best looking in a while. But these minds did a better job at introducing their new rich universe and this movie rather resembles its less mindblowing sequels.",Jupiter Ascending

112,DareDevilKid,Satisfying Space Opera – Good Fun Overall,7,12 February 2015,"Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 3.5/5 starsI should state upfront that my two main - really only two - grievances with the Wachowskis' ""Jupiter Ascending"" are that the fight scenes almost without exception stretch a tad too long, and the romantic track seems completely forced if not totally unnecessary. That's my way of telling you straight off that I am not in the anti- ""Jupiter Ascending"" camp. ""Jupiter Ascending"" delivers exactly what critics and film fans have been clamoring for – a wholly original, visionary science- fiction thrill ride that doesn't rely on a long-standing brand like ""Star Wars"" or ""Star Trek"", neither does it derive its material from any comic- book series. However, I feel that precisely because the film isn't on that familiar ground, it is suffering and struggling to find an audience. The days of seeing a trailer, some colorful poster art, and the basic excitement of knowing that we're getting a new film by a filmmaker or star we like are long gone, and I do not think we - or the movies - are the better for it.So, is ""Jupiter Ascending"" a masterpiece? No, but I doubt the Wachowskis ever intend to make one of those. Sadly, it was ""The Matrix"" astronomically raised expectations mold more than 15 years ago, and they haven't been able to recreate that magic. Still, if you're not going in to deride the movie because it's the cool thing to do, then you're going to miss a thoroughly enjoyable ride of pulpy old-school fun.The Wachowskis told us from the onset that this was a space opera – in other words, a horse opera (cowboy picture) in space. That is also what they delivered. They've given us a big, somewhat gaudy, colorful sci-fi adventure that is tethered to nothing other than their imaginations and influences. This is not to say that ""Jupiter Ascending"" is – as many have claimed – hard or impossible to follow.The story follows a young woman named Jupiter Jones (Mila Kunis) who lives with her Russian immigrant family, and earns a meager livelihood through myriad forms of drudgery in Chicago. However, when she stumbles onto an apparent alien abduction, she soon learns that she is intergalactic royalty, being hunted by several different bounty hunters. One of them, a lycan-soldier hybrid named Caine (Channing Tatum) saves her life, and takes her to the stars to claim her birthright ownership of the Earth. Of course, her intergalactic royal family are also scheming and fighting among themselves to seize control of the planet for sinister developmental purposes. The threat to their dominance comes in the form of Jupiter, who – through a fluke of nature – is the exact re-creation of the deceased mother of the bickering corporation heads, and also – by right of deed – owns Earth, a most desirable piece of real estate because it's ripe for ""harvesting."" (According to the Wachowskis' myth, it was always planned that mankind – the herd, seeded on Earth by the corporation — would exhaust the planet's resources. It's at that point that the planet is ripe for ""harvesting."")As stated earlier, one of the most depressing things about the release of ""Jupiter Ascending"" is the virtual feeding frenzy of criticism surrounding the film. The Wachowskis – who were once considered the golden children of science fiction, destined to lead a city of sequels, reboots and remakes out of the dark ages – have become two of the most maligned filmmakers for doing exactly what they're supposed to do: make original and stimulating science fiction cinema.Yeah, I know a lot of people have taken issue with some clunky writing and poor casting (looking at you, ""Cloud Atlas""). I don't deny those things exist in their films. However, there's still a lot of greatness in the Wachowskis' vision.Kunis and Tatum – while never considered as perfect casting for any of their roles – are entirely serviceable in the film, especially Tatum, with his naturally oozing, laidback star-appeal he so effortlessly brings to all his characters; no doubt he's considered as the next big Hollywood superstar. Kunis's character is sadly underwritten, and some of the silly decisions she makes throughout the film appear to be a result of the aforementioned bad writing that inherently plagues all post-Matrix Wachowski endeavors. The other thing that stands out as silly in this movie is Eddie Redmayne's breathy villain. He chews the scenery as badly as Gary Oldman did in ""The Fifth Element,"" but you can't fault him for his level of commitment. It's an over-the-top performance and a calculated misfire, but I could easily look past it and enjoy the film itself.""Jupiter Ascending"" probably looks more serious than it has any right to. Ultimately, it's a big, goofy sci-fi/action spectacle. I mean, this is a movie where the female lead is in love with a genetically-engineered hunk who just happens to be part wolf, and her entire response to this is a deadpan, silly one-liner: ""I love dogs. I've always loved dogs."" This is also a movie that so wears its fondness for ""Brazil"" (1985) on its sleeve that it brings in Terry Gilliam to play a space bureaucrat in its own ministry of information. Yes, it has some serious overtones, but you're most likely to come away from it with images of its fantastical worlds, and the indelible vision of Channing Tatum zipping around on anti- gravity roller blades. In other words, it's meant to be a big, highly imaginative, goofy, eye-popping spectacle, and it more than delivers and succeeds on these accounts. Ignore the snarky, misguided naysayers, grab your popcorn, and zip to your nearest theater to enjoy Tatum zooming across the screen in this lavish, fun sci-fi film.",Jupiter Ascending
113,RevRonster,I just couldn't take this film seriously.,3,7 August 2015,"I really gave this movie the benefit of the doubt but I couldn't stop laughing at how ridiculous it was.I have to say the visuals look very cool and all the costumes, ships and aliens reminded me of the pulp fiction Sci-fi novels of old and the performances from Mila Kunis, Channing Tatum and Sean Bean are very good but, aside from this, I just didn't care for this film and had the hardest time taking it seriously. The whole films feels like it is way over developed and produced, the action is kinda lame and forgettable and the story tries to be very rich but ends up being boring and messy. The whole film was just one giant accidental comedy for meexcept the actual comedy parts. I just couldn't laugh at those scenes.",Jupiter Ascending
114,bbickley13-921-58664,Very action packed Science fiction movie from the makers of the Matrix,7,7 February 2015,"The movie goes a different route with the anime The Wachowskis have proved to love with their most iconic film the Matrix, I think I spotted influences of neon genesis, Gundam and other mech anime.The action sequences were really good and there was a lot of them from beginning to end. Just wall to wall popcorn eating action. The siblings do action well too. It gave the feeling of a live action anime. It goes to show how much progress visual effects have had since the late 90s.I will say this. This movie seemed very dumb down from what the sibs usually like to spin. Though we see some philosophy on how the human race is not alone, it does not compare to what they gave us with the Matrix or even their last movie, Cloud Atlas. This is truly their mainstream breakout made mostly to be a money making blockbuster (that's how it feels anyway) It does this well with its amazing visual effects, and high octane space opera style adventure. Highly enjoyable.The movie seems fit Mila Kunis, yet I was not impressed with her or Channing Tatum, but this could be my on personal vice over the fact that they were picked to sell tickets. Mila's Character was real, or rather a fresh take on something that has been done many times before, but I felt Tatum had more of a hard on for Jonah Hill in the Jump Street franchise (To Hill's credit, maybe Tatum likes funny people) I did like how his dashing hero type did not over shadow Mila's character, who was not a typical damsel in distress, but could have used a few action scenes. I get the feeling that like M. Night Shyamalan with After Earth, The Wachowskis are playing the Hollywood game here and like with After Earth, producing so-so results that loosely resemble what got them to the big time in the first place.But overall The story's OK and it has a lot of effects driven action sequences. Not a bad way to spend two hours.",Jupiter Ascending
115,PyroSikTh,Ruined by Unnecessary Cuts,7,11 February 2015,"The world that is created for Jupiter Ascending is massive, from immortal royal siblings to genetic reincarnation, from world-farming to cross-splicing. The Earth is one of thousands of planets seeded thousands of years ago by a far more ancient and advanced humankind. They've taken the genetic age to the next level, creating elixirs of immortality and splicing human DNA with animal DNA to create hybrids bred for specific purposes. Then along comes Jupiter who is an exact genetic replica of a dead royal who gets thrust into this bizarre world and has to fend off these siblings who all want to take advantage of her, so they can claim back her estate under the name of their dead mother. Imagine The Matrix crossed with Game of Thrones in space. As concepts go, it's pretty phenomenal.The problem is that it's so phenomenal and epic in scope that there is no way to fit it into a single two hour movie, and this is, in my opinion, where the movie flounders most. No time is taken for anything to breath, from the story to the character development, to the concepts themselves. The audience is thrown in at the deep end and laid on with information after information in order to immerse yourself in this untold universe. It also means massive sacrifices are made to the story, it's pacing, and it's characters. We jump from one action setpiece to another with little or no transitional period in the middle, or any chance to build up to what's about to happen. There's no flow to it.The characters also take a massive nosedive, with each and every one of them becoming two- dimensional. Yes, this includes Caine and Jupiter, the lead characters. Neither of them are particularly interesting or entertaining, and the romance between them is forced in to appease an audience that no longer exists. Caine is half human/half wolf, who also happens to be half albino. He's a human who functions best in a pack, but was the ""runt of the litter"" so can easily fend for himself. He's a fearless and relentless warrior. This isn't me interpreting his character, this is literally what we're told about him almost word-for-word. Basically, he's the muscle and love interest, and that's about as interesting as he gets. Jupiter isn't much better. She's thrown into this fantasy universe of colours, strange alien creatures, bizarre technology so far above her own understanding, and into a culture that she's just expected to understand. Is she ever confused? Maybe for a couple of minutes. She seems to take it all in her stride. I mean, you find out your planet is one of thousands seeded with human life for harvesting in several millennia, and you're also an exact genetic replica (by chance) of the royal who owned your planet. The guy who just saved you from ET is half wolf, and you just willingly jump out of a window with him and his anti-gravity boots?The acting quality doesn't do much to rectify the flat characters either, if I'm honest. Mila Kunis and Channing Tatum are perfectly fine in their roles, but that's about as deep as it gets. They don't bring some miraculous new depth to the characters they play. This goes for pretty much every actor and actress, including Sean Bean (who doesn't die, woop), Douglas Booth, Doona Bae, David Ajala, and James D'Arcy. Unfortunately, 2015 Oscar nominated Eddie Redmayne is awful. Yeah, how he can be Oscar nominated in the same year a movie with a performance this bad comes out is beyond me. He's just the most awkward, wooden actor I've ever seen, even when, unbelievably, he's over-acting. I don't know how you can be wooden while you over-act, but he manages it. Ugh.On the plus side, the visual effects are amazing. We saw it in 3D as well, which had the added benefit of making it all pop. The spacecraft, the planets, the cityscapes, it's all breathtaking to watch. The action scenes as well are high octane with some really imaginative choreography. Which leads me nicely onto my second half of high praise for the visuals. It's not all about the quality of the CGI, but the imagination and design work as well. The spacecraft of Jupiter Ascending look like nothing else you've ever seen, and the sheer amount of imagination put into all these different pieces of technology are astounding; from wedding-ring tattooing to anti- gravity boots, genetic immortality to dresses that appear out of nowhere helping you dress in about three seconds. There's also an eclectic array of bizarre alien creatures. Now in my opinion, the film would've been better without them, keeping it simple with just humanity and the hybrids, but I have to give it to the design team; this level of variation in alien design is what you'd expect from Star Wars. And it's not just aliens, but the fashions as well, somehow without looking cheesy and like it'll be dated in a decade.So to conclude, Jupiter Ascending had so much potential. There's so much going on, with loads of really interesting concepts and a universe full of world-building, but unfortunately it's another sci-fi movie butchered by edit cuts to make it more profitable, which will inevitably cause it to flop. Studios just don't seem to understand this. At the end of the day, Jupiter Ascending would have greatly benefited from being at least three hours long, or maybe even a trilogy of movies. It would probably have been another masterpiece. And yet, it is not. It's a rushed mess that leaves it's characters behind and the story repetitive and unrewarding. Fortunately the astounding visuals will at least keep you from forgetting it any time soon. I give Jupiter Ascending a good 7/10, because there is promise in there, you just have to dig a little deeper.",Jupiter Ascending
116,MattBrady099,The Elephant beyond the stars,4,8 February 2015,"Jupiter Ascending probably has one of the funniest scene so far in 2015 and that is the scene where a captain of this ship who's in a war battle and the captain says ""Full speed a head"", and it pans down to this elephant man like creature and it makes the funniest noise ever and of cause I laughed my head off.The story is about Jupiter Jones (Mila Kunis), who was born under a night sky, with signs predicting she was destined for great things. Now grown, Jupiter dreams of the stars but wakes up to the cold reality of a job cleaning other people's houses and an endless run of bad breaks. Only when Caine (Channing Tatum), a genetically engineered ex- military hunter, arrives on Earth to track her down does Jupiter begin to glimpse the fate that has been waiting for her all along-her genetic signature marks her as next in line for an extraordinary inheritance that could alter the balance of the cosmos.I can't remember the time where the Wachowski made a good movie after the Matrix. Since then they made bad movie after bad movie and I don't know what to blame the writing or the directing, I think both since the Wachowski written and directed they movies and Jupiter Ascending is another one of they failures. Now I'm not the one who likes to bash some one who I know has great talent but I think some great talent forgot what made them so special in the first place.For the positive: The first action scene in this movie I got to admit it was on the same level of spectacular has the Matrix. The hairs on my arm stood up, it was truly breathtaking and unique. The score by Michael G Keno was just fantastic to listen to and Channing Tatum and Sean Bean was okay in the film. For I split second I thought this movie was going to be good, but then I sawed the rest of it and it left a bad taste in my mouth.Now for the bad and there's a lot: Mila Kunis in this movie pretty played the dumb damsel in distress that needs a man to save her ever 20 minutes and her character feels really miss cast and if they just cut her out of the movie it wouldn't make a difference, I mean really Wachowski? you could have done better than that I mean come on. Oh I almost forgot the dialogue in this movie was so bad it was Twilight dialogue bad. The Visual Effect's as well looked pretty fake at times even if it's in the background or the CG creatures, it still looked fake. Now we all know by now that Eddie Redmayne is a good actor. We know he can deliver dialogue and make it feel real and serious like a person, but in this I had no idea what on earth what he was doing. Over the top, chewing up scenery after scenery, laughable bad and a weird voice that's sounds like Richard Harris Dumbledore mix with Nicolas Cage if he was drunk and high. His performance was Razzie worthy bad and I don't blame him for this, I blame the writing and the directors because there they telling him what to do so I won't blame him for it, but come on Eddie I know your a nice guy in real life but did you even think ""Wow this is pretty laughably bad I should ask the directors to change it"".Overall Jupiter Ascending is just a Sci-Fi smash together mess. The action scenes may have been the only enjoyable part of the movie, but even that couldn't save this uninspiring, bloated mess of a film.",Jupiter Ascending
117,Al_The_Strange,A fun little spin around the universe on rocket boots,8,24 February 2015,"There are some sci-fi films that take viewers to strange new worlds, but there aren't many at all that take viewers on a roller-coaster ride through a fantastic universe full of intergalactic kingdoms so huge that they make the Earth look puny. In the Watchowskis' latest film, they dive into the staggering possibility that there are interstellar dynasties much larger and older than the Earth, which remains totally oblivious to their ancient schemes.As expected, the spectacle is huge, lavish, and larger-than-life. Some of the special effects are beautiful, showing incredible spaceships and planetscapes. There are a lot of fights and chases that involve high-speed alien ships, bizarre weaponry, and huge setpieces. As epic as the film is, it still takes the time to pace the characters through their discovery of the larger universe, allowing the plot to unfold at a laid-back pace. Through it all, the film never fully takes itself seriously; there's enough mild humor in the mix to keep the tone upbeat, without being overly silly. It's every bit as much of a fun thrill ride as movies like John Carter, or 1980's Flash Gordon. If that sounds like fun to you, then you'll likely enjoy Jupiter Ascending as well; if not, then don't bother.The story for Jupiter Ascending is basically a fairy tale set in space, following in the same formula as Cinderella. It also borrows some cues from The Matrix, especially in regards to featuring a main character who discovers that there's a larger truth that everybody else is oblivious to. As various mysteries are solved and the overarching conflict is revealed, the villains' plot proves to be a pretty smart ""what if"" idea that can stagger the imagination. Unfortunately, these ideas tend to be sidestepped by the characters and the action. I felt the characters were fine for what they were; Jupiter Jones has enough of a backstory and motivation to make her story halfway interesting. However, relating to her and the other characters tends to strain some viewers' abilities, making the experience a hit or a miss. In the story's efforts to draw out suspense, it goes through several peaks where the main heroine is thrown into peril and has to either fight or be rescued; the repetition of it can be tiresome.The film looks marvelous, with good photography and editing. The actors seem to get a lot of criticism in this film. I could take or leave Channing Tatum's typical tough-guy wolfman role, but I was fairly enamored by Mila Kunis (although not everybody will enjoy her performance). Other actors can be a hit or a miss, but they all show some color and flair. Writing could be more focused, but the dialogue does carry the signature brand of Watchowski wit, intelligence, and charm. This production boasts pretty good-looking sets, props, costumes, and special effects. Music is quite bombastic and adventurous.While not everybody will enjoy this film, I felt it was a perfectly fine piece of adventurous escapism, which taps into the same energy and sense of fun I've always enjoyed in films of the genre. I'd even say that if this film was more serious, it'd be dull. If you're a fan of the genre or directors, this is worth seeing at least once.4/5 (Entertainment: Good | Story: Pretty Good | Film: Good)",Jupiter Ascending
118,ArchonCinemaReviews,Junk food garbage - so bad it's funny,3,27 April 2015,"Jupiter Ascending is such an affront to the science fiction film genre that it might as well be a parody, the movie is that horrid.How can The Wachowskis, film makers responsible for such great and profound pieces of film, write and direct Jupiter Ascending, a movie so deplorably terrible and yet deliberate? Jupiter is an alien, illegal that is, living in New York City with her family as a cleaning lady. Life is tiresome and routine and she secretly longs for more. Jupiter gets more than she bargained for when she finds out there is an intergalactic world out there – and she is a noble woman reincarnate. Exploring the universe entails finding her battling spatial creatures and dealing with her spoiled children.Jupiter Ascending is so uninspired and poorly conceived it is genuinely comical. From the acting, directing and script to the lack of imagination and adventure, Jupiter Ascending is a failure from start to finish. All those involved in the picture would be better off had it never made it to the screen and no one had ever seen this piece of trash.Channing Tatum saunters about and pouts while donning an atrocious goatee. Mila Kunis says the words but does nothing to even attempt to salvage the movie with any excuse for acting. The worst by far is the gifted Eddie Redmayne, whose version of a bad guy is someone who whispers incessantly except when shouting. Though, admittedly, none of those involved were given much to work with.The caliber of final product in Jupiter Ascending is not even worthy for a made for TV-movie. The plot is near worthless and there was no reason for the script to be made and waste of time for all parties, but especially the audience viewers unlucky enough to watch the film.Please check out our website for full reviews of all the recent releases.",Jupiter Ascending

121,LloydBayer,"A banal, pointless and chaotic attempt at telling a sci-fi fairytale, Jupiter Ascending is light years away from the starry heights it aims for.",3,5 February 2015,"Once upon a time, a pretty damsel was forced to clean toilets until she was swept away by Prince Charming. She lost her slipper, he found it, they lived happily ever after. Heard that story before? Well, here it is again, an inter-galactic space opera called Jupiter Ascending, only this time, Cindy has to sacrifice her eggs so that aliens can live forever. Or something like that.Welcome to the world of the Wachowskis where a simple story has to be convoluted, contrived, and copious, just to illustrate even simpler metaphors in life. Brainchild of the Matrix films and Cloud Atlas, films about other worldly existence echoing real world choices, the Wachowskis stuff Jupiter Ascending with nonsensical psychobabble that converge into its preachy messages – Aim for the stars and you might just land on the moon, and that time is a universal commodity. Problem is, Jupiter Jones (Mila Kunis), is a starry eyed dreamer, but without any aspirations of being anything other than a janitor. As a Russian immigrant living with her family in Chicago, Jupiter's nonexistent life changes the day she is abducted by alien humanoids. Apparently, her genetic structure makes her a threat to an alien enterprise known as the Abrasax, alien royalty led by the evil Balem (Eddie Redmayne) and his siblings Titus (Douglas Booth) and Kalique (Tuppence Middleton). Balem wants Jupiter dead but Titus and Kalique have their own agenda so they send Caine (Channing Tatum) to protect her. Caine is no prince charming, but as a half-wolf, half-human, half-albino, genetically modified warrior, who can smell foul play a galaxy away, Jupiter has half a chance of outwitting the Abrasax. And she loves dogs. Thus begins a razzle-dazzle, visually bombastic, non-stop action fairytale that goes on and on and on until you realise you've been had.Sooner or later, and before the pyro-porn ending, you will also find yourself in increasing face-palm moments. For instance, by the time you look at your watch for the second time, Jupiter would have fallen from the skies several times, and each time she falls, Cain is there to rescue her. That's not just being tediously repetitive, it's downright bloatware filling up the running time. Neither are any of the actors worth mentioning, except that each is worse than the other. Kunis is definitely miscast and in over her head with nothing but dumb lines when her character isn't falling. Redmayne is perhaps the biggest disappointment as the villain, a role where he looks like Glenn Close from 101 Dalmatians and barely audible. It's a low blow considering his Oscar run in The Theory of Everything. As the only justifiable casting choice, Tatum has some inventive stunts during action scenes requiring Cain to fly around using jet propulsion boots. It's a nice touch and perhaps the only thing original in this film.It won't take long for fans of the Wachowskis to accept that this film isn't about passion or a vision or anything resembling conventional storytelling. It's a film made for the heck of it where almost every bit of its $175 million production budget seems to favour visual effects that are frankly has-beens in a Michael Bay film. Add to that, ludicrous characters (a lizard henchman and an elephant that flies a spaceship?), an ill-conceived mythology alongside a struggling story and we are left with a colossal failure as large yet as insignificant as the titular planet. The Wachowskis on the other hand, have aimed for the stars but seem to have crash landed in a black hole. If only they had paid a little attention to Christopher Nolan.",Jupiter Ascending

The story, acting, all that is OK, but what is a shame is that the action is not really very good. This is action from the people who made The Matrix, a total classic with awesome action, why is the action here so.. bland?And Eddie Redmayne, oh my good god, he overacts to such an extreme degree, he is so annoying! (see Jeremy Jahns review for a good impression) He actually dragged the whole movie down with his stupid, stupid performance.

124,James_De_Bello,3.5/10,3,6 February 2015,"I was trying to think of a kind introduction to start, but there is just no two ways around it, this movie is terrible and is worsen by the fact that it is made by the people who brought us The Matrix and Cloud Atlas, the last of which I do not love but definitely enjoy and highly respect for ambitiousness. I actually had some kind of hope going in, but everything collapsed from frame one and never got back up.There is nothing to get angry about here because nothing is trying to reach for a profound message or a high allegory, it is just trying to be fun, failing terribly at it, but never was I bored to the point of sleep or angry to the point of kicking the seat in front of me, so there isn't really a reason for a lower grade. And despite all the negatives in it, the score is kind of really good, Kunis and Tatum, of whom I am a big fan, are charismatic and decent enough to keep bore levels at an acceptable low value Sean Bean is as always illuminating on screen and some, and I repeat some, of the visuals are really eye-pleasing.But enough of that, this film is a mess, it is so bloated, non-sense, out of nowhere and tonally all over the place I could not make heads or tails of why what was happening on screen was happening. It is really an example of how storytelling should not be done. I can't even start to process the thought that the same people who wrote the Matirx, wrote this total chaos. Things happen randomly on screen, characters are flat and unbelievable, the story never, ever makes sense and about a dozen story arcs are opened and never closed. This was a real atrocity to behold. Moreover the visuals were actually, for the majority lame! Yes the CGI was excellent and the design was partly wonderful, but the editing, the epileptic cuts the incomprehensible action and again the bloated scenes were even worse than the story's mess. I can see the brilliance of John Toll in some parts, but mostly it was erased by terrible editing. In my ""Theory of Everything"" review I said that after Les Miserables and the film itself, Eddie Redmayne could do no wrong...I eat my words, he was the worst performer of all, and believe me when I say that some performances are really terrible, I am so sorry for him.Ah, this was just a waste of time, don't go see it in the theaters, don't rent it don't watch it, it is really bad and it hurts really bad to say that being a real fan of almost all of the filmmakers and actors involved.",Jupiter Ascending

All of the backstory blew my mind. The visuals were insane and unlike anything I've seen before. The story moves very quickly and the world is so rich and fully realized that the characters talk in a lingo from another universe that it's hard to keep up with, but in a good way. And you don't really need to get it. Multiple viewings will only make the dialogue easier to understand.The story was very basic and told in a great way. This is way more SciFi/fantasy than a lot of things. Very much like the rough draft of Star Wars and final brings to the screen the imagination of SciFi from the past.Demands all of your attention for the entire movie because there's is no wasted second. The dialogue is quick and so is the action.It's only a shame that the two most ground breaking movies since The Phantom Menace, this and Valerian were panned by everyone.

126,shawneofthedead,A beautifully-crafted world that's practically begging for sequels - but is unlikely to get them because the plot and characters are somewhat undercooked.,6,18 February 2015,"You can't fault the Wachowskis for ambition. Jupiter Ascending, their latest foray into the sci-fi/fantasy genre, is a triumph of world creation - the film grafts an astoundingly complex and layered fantasy universe onto our own that could easily support a clutch of films, a television series and spin-off novels galore. But it also suffers from a weak script - the Wachowskis appear to have extracted the fascinating details of their breathtaking world from the 600 pages of their first draft, but only remembered to ask their characters along for the ride as an afterthought.Jupiter Jones (Mila Kunis) can't imagine much of a world beyond the tiny one she inhabits: she cleans toilets with her mother and covets a telescope so she can travel into the stars. That journey becomes quite a literal one, however, when the unique pattern of her DNA comes to the attention of the money-grabbing, galaxy-dominating Abrasax siblings: Balem (Eddie Redmayne), Titus (Douglas Booth), and Kalique (Tuppence Middleton). Suddenly, she is the focus of an intense (wo)manhunt that spans universes. Caine Wise, a genetically- spliced former soldier, fights off assassins and bounty-hunters alike to emerge with Jupiter by his side. But, as the two bond and Jupiter uncovers the truth about her place in the wider world, Caine starts to doubt whether he should surrender her to the Abrasax family after all.The breadth and depth of the Wachowskis' new cinematic playground has to be seen to be believed. Like all good sci-fi/fantasy, it explodes the notions of time and space that we live with everyday, crafting a sprawling universe that you can easily believe exists alongside our own. Concepts we take for granted - mankind, evolution, history, capitalism and reincarnation - are turned on their heads. All of this is presented in a matter-of-fact, almost casually realistic way: Caine sports pointed ears as a hint to the strain of wolf in his genes, alien races subsist alongside space- faring humans, and the scientific notion of DNA is given an intriguing spiritual twist. It all adds up to a universe it'd be easy to get lost in - a fictional construct of such staggering complexity that revisiting it would be a pleasure.But, for all the intricacies of their world-building, the Wachowskis don't manage to breathe quite enough life into their plot or characters. As Jupiter meets and invariably falls out with each member of the Abrasax clan, the narrative jerks speedily along in episodic chunks. The romance that inevitably springs up between Jupiter and Caine can also be frustrating in the extreme, partly because it feels like it comes out of nowhere - but also because it's just rather poorly-written. Even so, for all of Jupiter Ascending's plotting problems, it's easy to imagine a television series - allowed to unfold at a slower pace - realising the promise hidden within so many moments of the film.It's also tough to warm up to most of the characters populating this world. The Abrasax siblings, in particular, are a frustrating bunch. It's annoying enough that they're written as one-note villains, drunk on vanity and longevity and locked into centuries of internecine warfare. What's even stranger is that they're so determinedly played as such. Booth and Middleton are both awkward and arch, barely able to suggest unseen layers when the script provides for them. An otherwise great actor, Redmayne, too, is reduced to a strange, low-pitched snarl of a character here; Balen radiates a static buzz of megalomania that becomes almost comical as the film wears on. At least Jupiter Jones is a fun character to spend time with. She may be weighed down by a slightly soggy romance and a rather disturbing alter ego, but it's nice to have such a huge movie assembled around a female character as self-possessed and determined as she is. Jupiter holds true to her own ideals and family, even when she's confronted with the possibility that - in another lifetime - she might not have cared all that much about either. Kunis is rather charming, shaking up her trademark cocktail of innocence and world-weariness as Jupiter. There are a few enjoyable character beats for Caine, too, particularly when the film delves into his history with another decommissioned inter-galactic soldier, Stinger Apini (Sean Bean).It's a rare movie that manages to inspire and disappoint at the same time. But that's precisely what Jupiter Ascending does. The Wachowskis present such an intoxicating vision of their universe (dinosaurs, bees and all) that the thought of spending more time in it is wonderfully appealing. It's a shame that the story they've chosen as the focus of the film is broken up into such awkward chunks, with its characters getting more than a little lost in the tumult of ideas.",Jupiter Ascending

It was a bit of both. I lost interest very quickly for a number of reasons. First and foremost, JA is a cold, hollow movie. The dialogue's heavy and clunky, leads Mila Kunis and Channing Tatum feel the blow. Kunis isn't shocked to learn that she's intergalactic royalty, and Tatum spends most of his alien life skating the skies, avoiding enemy fire from those seeking to hurt Kunis. Secondly the Wachowskis have tried too hard to create a piece of work that as unique as The Matrix. Much of film's time and effort is spent on how it looks, and it does look incredible, thanks to 99 shots out of 100 being computer generated. The actors are engulfed by it, chiefly Eddie Redmayne's ridiculous talking villain, who's hellbent on destroying Kunis just for being a greedy little planet hoarder.It's best to end on a high note, because not all's bad. In between the scant story is a couple of really joyful set-pieces. Both are sky battles, one at both ends of the film. They are thrilling, but not long lasting. There should be more of them, to give JA reason to have our utmost attention.",Jupiter Ascending

131,ayoreinf,"Literary suspension of judgment, pushed as far as it goes",8,8 February 2015,"I'm sorry but I've got to start here with a short explanation - as suspension of judgment is mostly referred to in its philosophical sense or in its scientific sense which are fairly similar, that is a request not to judge the obvious lack of logic of certain aspects of study until the whole study is completed and then can be judged in its entirety. While in its literary sense one means not to relate to the actual logical possibility of something happening but rather to judge its literary merit. Almost all science fiction requires some suspension of judgment. Jupiter Ascending requires it more than most. In fact as far as I can see it it's a sci-fi fairy tale, with most the fairy tale ingredients being there from a damsel in distress to her knight in shining armor from the dragon or dragons the knight will have to fight to the wicked witch or the evil warlock or both. The basic premise of replacing magic with science is not new and is repeated more than once in science fiction, going as far as sometimes stating that magic is a form of science which the viewers simply can't figure out. As for the pros for this movie - it does delve into real sci-fi question, which I can't reveal here without adding a spoiler, let me just say it touches upon the measure of human lives and their value.As for all other aspects of movie making. CG, are breath taking, almost visionary in their scope. Acting is very good, though as it was mentioned here, there are very few real characters in this film, about five, the others are no more than glorified extras, or background cartoons trying to add some levity to the general pompous tale about the fate of the universe. For me this pompous air radiating from the movie is its worse fault, and a lot more humor should have been there to counter it. The pace is obviously relentless, to give the viewers less time to think about how much of a stretch the plot is. But taken as a fairy tale it's much more acceptable, and for me that's the only way to take it. More humor, and some better secondary characters would have made this eye feast a real gem of a movie, but even as is it's not as bad as so many people here and elsewhere made us believe.",Jupiter Ascending

133,Ryan_MYeah,A misfire in every sense of the word.,3,24 June 2015,"There really are no directors like The Wachowski's, and ever since their surprise smash hit with The Matrix, the good will towards their names never seem to stop. It's actually surprising considering how the two are always able to secure elaborate mega-budgets, and yet a lot of their movies, original in concept but out of control and utterly strange in execution, feel like wastes of those budgets. That said, even when their movies are terrible, they don't strike out as much as they create fascinating misfires that can be enjoyed in their own right. Their track record is flimsy, but I'd say their only total failure is The Matrix Revolutions. As for Jupiter Ascending, I feel genuinely terrible for criticizing it, as I respect the vision here. This is an ode to every epic space opera the filmmakers have ever loved, and it's clear a lot of painstaking detail has gone into it. There's some admitted creativity with how the two are always trying to pull the rug out from the viewer, but it does so at the cost of coherence. The film feels like a two hour compilation of a full season TV show, dropping numerous plot threads and characters just as quickly as they're established, and serve little to no actual purpose to the main narrative. It also seems designed as an alternative to the string of Young Adult novel adaptations, but ironically ends up becoming exactly like one of those movies, simplifying the characters, skimping out on necessary exposition, and leaving this entire universe to operate on whatever logic it feels like at the time.On top of that, it's burdened with some of the worst acting I've seen this year. As Channing Tatum is forced to play straight faced and charmless and Eddie Redmayne consistently mumbles in monotone whispers, they're both forced to pick up the slack for Mila Kunis' passive and needy damsel in distress. By the time a major action set piece between enemy ships finally takes place 25 minutes through, this film has genuinely given me no reason to care. That said, it's a film whose craft can be admired where the story can't be. The visual effects are beautiful, the sound is creative (even if that random dog barking gun effect is annoying), and Michael Giacchino pays glorious tribute to every classic Sci-Fi score he's ever loved. Outside of those bright spots, though, this is another interesting misfire from the directing duo, but a bad movie by any other name is still a bad movie.",Jupiter Ascending
134,trublu215,Jupiter Ascending is loud and overtly obnoxious,3,4 February 2015,"Jupiter Ascending marks the return to the silver screen for the Wachowski duo since 2011's Cloud Atlas and, much like that film, it boasts a talented set of hands behind the camera but fails to produce a shred of believable acting and good storytelling. Telling the story of Jupiter Jones, a housemaid living on Earth, as she is suddenly abducted by a genetically altered soldier, Cain, in hopes to fulfill her unknown destiny. This film wants more than anything to be taken seriously but in order to do that, the film would need to cut Channing Tatum's super elf ears and Mila Kunis' complete lack of interest to even be close to being a good film. The Wachowski duo are hell bent in creating worlds that seem as real as the room you're in but fail to create a story worth telling. By all traditional standards, Jupiter Ascending seems like a logline from a 12 year old's composition book and the film plays out very similar to that. Anyone with eyes can tell that Tatum and Kunis are counting down the hours until they can go home, they look completely disinterested in the story at hand. This makes for trouble especially when Jupiter becomes endangered. While these scenes do boast some clever action sequences, there isn't a sense of danger in this scenes. There's nothing white knuckle about it which leads to there being nothing remotely breath taking, all due to Tatum's and Kunis' urge to act as if they are sleep walking through their green screen sets. They are two really poor performances that serve as heavy disappointments considering how good we all know these two can be. The Wachowski duo's script is what seems to be in question here. There's no suspense to it and nothing remotely relate-able to any of these characters. While I do realize this is probably one of the most unrealistic sci-fi movies I could be saying that about, I do also come to terms with the fact that it is their jobs to make even being a long lost princess in a galaxy far and away to be sort of relate-able and she's not, not in the very least. Tatum plays Cain with a brutish efficiency but, in the end, I could have cared less if his character lived or died. The reason The Matrix was so good, besides having the best action sequences ever in it, was also because Keanu Reeves made the unrealistic realistic, he made us connect to him and made us want him to succeed, no matter how ridiculous the situation was. Unfortunately, Tatum and Kunis can't seem to elevate this dull script to being anything remotely enjoyable. The action sequences are brilliantly choreographed and expertly captured but nothing else in this film outside technical work is anything to rave about. If you are looking for the next Matrix, it looks like you'll have to wait for their next one because Jupiter Ascending is dull, boring, loud and obnoxious.",Jupiter Ascending

This drivel is supposed to be about a wretched anglo-Russian girl (Kunis) who miraculously has the same genetic imprint as a millennia-old royal just dead in outer space. The royal was part of a family looking for profit from creating life on suitable planets which are then farmed for their body fluids to produce immortal bath salts for those who can pay. Cra* concept and an even worse script, direction, and character development has resulted! It is all CGI, but for what? The characters are totally uninteresting. Even the evil offspring of the dead royal, who just ooze 'orribleness and are of course played by British actors (including star of the moment Eddie Redmayne!), are one-dimensional. The hero, half wolf, half man, Channing Tatum, remains stony faced and just jets about on a set of gravity boots better than Superman! The only interest is Sean Bean and whether he will last beyond the second reel. From the trailer he looked certain for an early demise but he keeps hanging on! The script is just a series of bang crashes, and scenes of jeopardy for our two leads and how are they going to get out of them - yawn, yawn! The CGI is boring inside two minutes. And the whole film is a derivative sham. You will recognise 'Star Wars' 'North by North West' 'Jurassic Park 2' 'Superman' 'Flash Gordon' and particularly 'Dune' as well as many others.

The story is so mellow, slow and boring it's incredible WB wanted to spend 175m$ on it. The characters are disastrously 2 dimensional it's almost impossible to care for them. And the bad guy...my god, Oscar winner Eddie Redmayne plays a whispering (no really) queer old dork who is unbearable to watch. The dialogue is uninspired, simplistic and lame. The Matrix used contemporary Metal and Techno music in the coolest ways possible, to amp up the action to adrenaline pumping heights. Here all action seems so basic, slow and unspectacular. And the rather run of the mill orchestral music doesn't help either. The only good thing maybe is the visuals, the film looks good but the design seems weird, uneven and random. There is like a female character with these huge rat ears. wtf? These movie doesn't feel like it had strong directors with a vision behind the wheel. It's more like all departments did whatever they wanted and then they threw everything on a pile and the editor mashed it up into a movie of some sorts. I bet the suits at Warner p*ssed their pants when they saw what a stinker they had on their hand after the first screening. Washowski's, get your act together coz you won't be able to ride on the Matrix fame forever. Ask Shayamalan, things can go south pretty quickly career wise.

The acting and cast does a solid job, with Eddie Redmayne continuing to establish himself as a premier actor in Hollywood. The effects were adequate, though not necessarily up to par with the best of modern science-fiction/fantasy films. Honestly, the biggest drawbacks of the films were that the ""strangeness"" of the world presented to you (and the universe itself) doesn't feel sufficiently developed, the plot feels a tad bit cliché, and the plot seems to force the romance element on the audience around the halfway point in the film without every developing it previously. Negatives aside, however, and it was still a fairly enjoyable film with some potential.",Jupiter Ascending
140,fung0,"Not a Classic, but a Worthy Effort",7,15 May 2015,"It's sad to see an interesting, even thoughtful space-opera like Jupiter Ascending with an IMDb rating of 5.6, while brainless drivel like Gravity scores 7.9, and a confused mess like Interstellar gets a ridiculous 8.7.That's not to say that Jupiter Ascending is a work of genius. But it's a film that achieves more or less what it sets out to accomplish. It's got a story that makes sense (within its own rules), and it even works on more than one level. Unlike Gravity, it doesn't flout the laws of Newtonian physics in every shot. And unlike Interstellar, it doesn't pretend to be deep, while actually making very little sense at all.Underneath all the flashy CG, Jupiter Ascending is a very simple little film. I don't want to spoil the plot, even to make a point, because my point is that this film is worth seeing, as long as you approach it the right way. Suffice to say that the plot is straightforward, if not immediately apparent at the start. The characters are simple, B-movie style, but their internal logic holds up.And there's a pretty interesting moral to the whole story. This film asks whether human society must always be a pyramid, in which billions at the base have nothing so that a handful at the peak can achieve a life of almost unimaginable luxury. This question isn't worked out in any great detail, but it does give the film a surprisingly strong foundation. There are some big ideas here - no more credible than George Lucas 'force' philosophy, perhaps, but no less so either.Beyond that, some of the imagery is genuinely original - though I did wish the frenetic action sequences hadn't been confusingly shot in close-up, where medium or long shots would have been more effective. Jupiter Ascending isn't as successful as the Wachowsky's previous Cloud Atlas (which truly is a brilliant film), but it's far more effective than their greatest misfire, Speed Racer. (Which somehow manages a 6.1 on IMDb.)If you like fast-paced space opera in the Star Wars mold, Jupiter Ascending is definitely worth a look.",Jupiter Ascending
141,kevinxirau,"Good ideas, horrible execution.",3,13 November 2015,"Jeez, what the hell happened? Now to their credit, the Wachowskis do have some skill as filmmakers, all credit due to their impressive work on flicks such as the Matrix trilogy and ""V For Vendetta"", the first of which revolutionized the world of cinema with not only some creative cinematography (like bullet-time), but also showing that action films can be thought-provoking. Yes, there was some stuff to pick apart and make fun of, but the effort is nonetheless admirable. But like all good filmmakers, they too fall prey to making a film that sucks the dignity out of their career and the one that perfectly embodies this is Jupiter Ascending. How bad is it? Plot: Immigrant Jupiter Jones (Mila Kunis) has had a pretty uneventful, less-than pleasant life, always wanting more than just cleaning the homes of the wealthy. One day, however, that all changes when a genetically-engineered half human, half canine soldier named Caine Wise (Channing Tatum) saves her from deadly aliens and tells her that she is the rightful inheritor of planet Earth. Conspiring against her are three ancient siblings, who each want to take ownership of the world for their own sinister purposes. With Caine protecting her from all threats, Jupiter must travel a universe full of advanced technology and strange creatures to realize her destiny.Now, that plot simplification I just gave is the best I can do because the story is not only really complex but amazingly boring. There are scenes that seem to drag on for eternity even with all the flashy effects they put into this film. Some details take center stage over others that are more important or interesting and are likely to make you facepalm over the logic behind them. The filmmakers also feel the need to have the characters say lots of exposition rather than just showing you it, after all that's the point of a visual medium. Most of the characters themselves are duller than watching paint dry and do some pretty nonsensical things. The main villains, the Abrasax siblings, are nothing spectacular, especially Eddie Redmayne as Balem Abrasax, who is not only horribly acted but his dialogue is so mind-numbing he'll put you to sleep only to catch you off guard with the random laughably hammy outburst of his voice. Perhaps the most insulting thing about Jupiter Ascending is that it repeats plot points that were just used earlier in the film as if it thinks we have the shortest attention span, not that you'll be likely to get all the insane number of crammed details on the first viewing.I only found a few things to like in this film. The universe is a rather interesting with cool-looking space tech and many of the creatures have great designs. Some of the ideas presented are interesting and, having lots of potential, would have been more effective with a better script or story like the reason the Abrasax siblings want Earth so much. The action scenes are also good to watch, lots of cool moves performed, lasers firing, ships flying. The best fight scene involves these awesome dragon creatures, the way they fly around chasing and battling the protagonists, easily being the best part of this crappy film.The main problems Jupiter Ascending suffers are that it fails to live up to its potential and it focused on areas that are not executed right or not focused enough. As the Nostalgia Critic puts it, it attempts to sound big rather than feel big. While there are technically worse movies out there, this is far from a crowning achievement of the Wachowskis. It makes the ""Mega Shark vs"" movies look like Oscar winners. Good luck getting through this film because it left nothing but a bad taste in my mouth.",Jupiter Ascending
142,Spideyfan-963-246215,Jupiter Ascending Review,1,9 September 2016,"Jupiter Ascending(2015) Starring: Mila Kunis, Channing Tatum, Eddie Redmayne, Sean Bean, Douglas Booth, Tuppence Middleton, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Vanessa Kirby Directed By: Andy Wachowski and Lana Wachowski Review Expand your universe. Okay so I'm just curious when it was revealed who Channing Tatums character was spliced with the DNA of a dog was anyone else thinking about that thing from spaceballs. You know I do contend with most Matrix fanboys that the scond sequel was crap and I honestly thought that no other film they made could be bad cause I love Speed Racer and Cloud Atlas but holy crap today I found out I was wrong Jupiter Ascending is a worse film then the third Matrix movie and I'm sorry, but I don't think that is a statement that anyone can make lightly Revolutions was the film that turned most Wachowski fans against them, well except me. And it's not even the worst film they made. Basically the whole movie is a pissing contest from these three royal douchbags space siblings about who gets ownership of earth. That is literally the whole movie, that's all its about. Three Royal douchbags having a pissing contest. Mila Kunis plays Jupiter Jones who is the reincarnation of a space queen I guess owned earth before she was murdered and because of this Jupiter is technically the owner of earth. Now these stick a banana in your mouth a-holes are trying to manipulate giving up her ownership of the earth or something like I don't I'm just surprised I didn't take a nap during this movie. Channing Tatum plays Kane who is a man spliced with wolf DNA for the military and he literally only exists to save Mila Kunis in this movie. That is the whole reason he exists, he adds no other purpose. That's all he does. Mila Kunis has to be saved by this guy at least twenty freaking times in this movie. Because you know God forbid we can have a strong female protagonist in this movie. Screw that crap! We need Channing Tatum to come be the hero every five minutes! This movie is just stupid, incompetent, lazy, and bad. Let's get the very few good things about this movie out of the way. The score for this film is beautiful Michael G. Achenio(I think that's how you spell his name) his composing was wonderful as it was for Dawn of the planet of the Apes. The film is shot beautifully theirs a scene about forty five minutes in with this huge erial battle taking place above a city and it looks great. That being said though the action scenes are too far between and each one of the fails to comparison to what I've seen in other Wachowski movies their fine but the matrix movies blow them all out of the water. Lastly the acting from Mila Kunis, Channing Tatum, Sean Bean was not bad their characters were bad and at times very irrating with how stupid they were but the performances were just fine. That ends the good stuff everything else is just bad. All the ideas this film has just there to try make the film look smarter then what it really is and it doesn't work on any level. I have not been this bored with a scince fiction film since.......................... Oh god.......... oh God.............. Oh God.......... Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace. Were as that film was just nothing but random ass jargon involving taxation and trade routes with a ton of hilariously bad dialogue and a few cool action scenes scattered throughout, Jupiter Ascending is nothing but random stuff about jargon about land ownership with hilariously bad dialogue and a couple of cool action scenes scattered throughout. The biggest issue with this film and this is a big issue for any film is jut that the characters are terrible. Jupiter Jones is so freaking useless in this film, like I said most of this movie consist of is her being saved by Channing Tatum. Wachowski's Lana and Andy Wachowski pay attention theirs two movies you needed to see to make this, one- The Terminator, Sara Coners progression in that film from the scared young waitress to the ultimate badass chick of the future was perfect. The second film was ( you paying attention cause I hope you are) its the freaking Matrix! Neo's progression from an I don't give a crap computer hacker to the savior was masterfully done, Neo is a great freaking character! You should know because you wrote him! The sad thing is I was actually looking foreword to this film I saw the trailer a crap ton of times in theaters and on TV and I couldn't wait to see it. It looked like an awesome Space opera created by the Wachoski's and to me that sounded perfect combo because of their visual style from speed Racer, and action from the Matrix. But what I got instead was underwhelming, overbloated, mess of a film that offers nothing concrete for its audience in its story, no interesting sory or development, squanders good actors with a hacky script and on top of that squanders awesome visual effects and score in favor of uninteresting characters talk about bull, I've been a fan of the Wachoskis since the first two matrix movies and speed racer and cloud atlas are two of my favorite movies but this was the biggest disappointment of the year. I'm giving Jupiter Ascending a half out of five.",Jupiter Ascending
143,mr_bickle_the_pickle,An Overall fun movie despite its problems,7,7 February 2015,"Jupiter Ascending is the story of a woman named Jupiter (Mila Kunis) who gets thrust into a whole new world when it is discovered that she is the reincarnation of a queen. This now gives her rights to Earth. Of course, there are people that aren't too happy about that because they have their own plans for Earth. Caine (Channing Tatum) goes along for the ride serving the purpose of being Jupiter's protector.Now, I didn't go into this film expecting a whole lot. I mainly was just looking for something fun. And on that aspect, the film delivered. It was a fun movie to watch from start to finish. That being said there were some things that bugged me about the movie. For starters : Eddie Redmayne's weird accent. So for all those people who scrunched up their faces when Jodie Foster spoke in Elysium.yeahit's kind of like that. A weird choice for sure. I also didn't care much about Jupiter. Which I know is weird considering the movie is named after her and all. But, she was just the least interesting to me. She was too much of a damsel in distress. Always needed saving, relied on too many people to make decisions for her. There was one scene towards the end where she actually stood up for what she believed in that I liked, but even then she still ended up getting rescued by Caine for what felt like the billionth time. I just wanted more out of her. There were also some things that never really got resolved. And the one example I'm gonna use is a bit of a spoiler, so maybe just skip past this if you don't want to know. Titus (Douglas Booth) basically owns up to the fact that he planned on murdering Jupiter after marrying her (so he could then have the rights to Earth), but nothing ever becomes of it. You see Caine in a later scene that ""He'll make sure Titus pays"", but you never see anything happen to him. He's never arrested or taken in front of a council, you don't see Caine take revenge on him. Nothing. In fact, he pretty much disappears after that. What happened to him? And the last thing that bugged me was this action sequence right after Caine first rescues Jupiter and they're about to board his ship, but they end up getting thwarted by some aliens (i forget what their species name was). It was an incredibly cool scene, no doubt. However, I couldn't believe that Jupiter survived all that. In the very least she should have had whiplash. But no, she's totally OK. *Eye roll*.Despite those things though, there were some things I did like about the film. The visuals are amazing. Special effects were great. There were some amazing, gorgeous costumes (I do hope it gets a nomination from the Oscars next year) as well as make-up and hairstyling. All deserving. I also liked Channing Tatum in this. What is wrong with me? Since when is Channing Tatum a highlight of a film? I don't know, but he is. I also did like the plot of the film, and I wouldn't mind seeing more of that universe expanded. The action sequences are great, lots of fun, and keep you on the edge of your seat. The dialogue was a bit iffy at times, but nothing that bugged me too much. I also really liked Caine's anti-gravity boots. It was cool how he used them to ""skate"" through the air. The film did give me vibes of Star Wars. Not just because its a space epic where a protagonist discovers their true self etc. But majorly because the score of Jupiter Ascending sounded very similar to the Star Wars prequels score. It also reminded me of Cloud Atlas a bit. Mainly the ""Somni-451"" segment of Cloud Atlas, in terms of the ships and landscapes. Which isn't surprising since both were The Wachowski's. Also another similarity was the fact that Doona Bae's hair in this was very Lana Wachowski-esque. All in all, I did enjoy the film. It could have definitely been better though. But I would be up for a sequel, if that ever happened. I gave the film a 7, because 6 seemed too low me and as I said, it was a fun movie.",Jupiter Ascending

They have watched it twice now and were rooting for the eponymous ""Jupe"" from start to finish. Although the bramble patch that doubled for a story kept my children asking questions all the way through...I mean, seriously... What the hell, Wachowskis? This was not your finest storytelling hour.From an Adult's standpoint, this film is a mess from start to finish... Whisking the viewer from stunning set-piece scene to stunning scene to a cottage in the countryside... To the centre of a maelstrom... Set against a grandiose and splendid background, the story comes across as irrevocably insipid and weak, all but overpowered by the looming shadows of the fabulously powerful galaxy the sisters created. Moreover, the ""plot"" moves on so quickly that the audience are unable to form connections with any of the characters or settings. Any characterisations that are there, are shallow and the outcome is pretty obvious from the get go.Which is a crying shame since the sumptuous, no expenses spared sets and clearly well thought out Galactic milieu were tantalising us with its beauty and implied depth... It was crystal clear that the sisters had worked hard on building a galaxy with a deep, sordid history far too long and far too out of control and crowded for comfort... A backdrop that would have been perfect for an epic story to be set in.Instead, I have to ask... to what purpose did they create this? It just seems such an egregious waste of resources and effort for a story so simple as to be second rate.I can honestly only assume it was initially meant to be series but then something went wrong and the entire first season was compressed into a 2 hour mashup of sadly missed potential.

Impossible and pointless.This easily had the opportunity of becoming something akin to Luc Besson's 5th Element or the rich tapestry of Star Wars or as I mentioned, a whole, new series.Instead we were offered a pedestrian plot with non stop, escalating fight scenes and a really cringeworthy ""love"" story... and a skating alien!!!My daughters really want to watch it again!

146,CleveMan66,"""Jupiter Ascending"" is the richest and most original sci-fi mythology this side of George Lucas.",9,7 February 2015,"Some of the more far-out theories on the origin of the human race hold that our distant ancestors were placed on this planet by beings from outer space. Crop circles and other physical characteristics of our planet's surface that can only be appreciated from well above the earth are sometimes used as evidence supporting these theories. While the suggestions that our race's origins are extraterrestrial can't be proved, it does make for some pretty intriguing conjecture. ""Jupiter Ascending"" (PG-13, 2:07) takes such ideas seriously, presents them as a given and uses them as the launching pad for a thinking-outside-the-box kind of science fiction fantasy action adventure.Mila Kunis (who, in real life, was born in the former Soviet Union) is Jupiter Jones, a young woman in Chicago who cleans homes with her widowed Russian immigrant mother (Maria Doyle Kennedy). Jupiter (named after the planet by her British astronomer father who died right before she was born) wants more out of life than scrubbing toilets, but isn't doing anything to improve her situation, simply mumbling ""I hate my life"" when the alarm clock goes off at 4:45 a.m. each day. Well, Jupiter's life is about to change in ways that she could never have imagined, and finding out that we are not alone in the universe is only the beginning.It turns out that Jupiter has the exact genetic make-up of a long-dead queen in one of the most powerful royal families in the universe. That entitles her to a portion of the family inheritance – a portion which just happens to include a small blue planet that we all know and love. When the former queen's three children, Titus (Douglas Booth), Kalique (Tuppence Middleton), and Balem (Eddie Redmayne), become aware of Jupiter's existence (and very special genetic make-up), Titus and Balem each hire people (if that's what you can call genetically-engineered bounty hunters that are only partially human) to find her to strengthen their own claims to their mother's galactic estate. The one who gets to her first and rescues her from the clutches of the others is Caine Wise (Channing Tatum), who, with the help of old friend Stinger Apini (Sean Bean) helps her claim her inheritance. Jupiter's station in life has infinitely improved, but she finds herself caught up in the rivalry between the queen's offspring, and also soon learns some things that threaten everything she holds dear.As I sat in the theater, I noticed influences from a number of other movies. For me, this film (to varying degrees) triggered memories of films as disparate as ""The Wizard of Oz"", ""Star Wars"", ""The Matrix"", ""Elysium"" and even ""The Graduate"" and ""Soylent Green"". As noticeable as those various undercurrents may be, ""Jupiter Ascending"" feels very fresh. I consider it the most original and richest sci-fi mythology created this side of George Lucas. But this film's originality extends well beyond the story's plot points. The script (and the movie's title) contains some clever double meanings and some moments of humor, which amuse, but don't detract from the realistic feeling for which the film is (successfully) striving. While many of the characters were reminiscent of those in the ""Star Wars"" films, their origins are very different. The production design that went into creating the planets and space ships drew on unusual inspiration such as Gothic and Renaissance art and architecture which works remarkably well and adds to that feeling of originality which is prevalent throughout the film. The visual effects are similarly inventive, complement the scenery wonderfully and are tremendously colorful and thrilling – especially if you can see them in IMAX 3-D.Undergirding it all are universal themes of family and selflessness on one hand, with self-centeredness and greed on the other, and literary themes as old as Homer's ""Odyssey"". There's a lot going on in ""Jupiter Ascending"". It's not that the film is too hard to follow, but I find myself wanting to see it again - just to more fully appreciate the depth of the characters and the richness of the story – and to again enjoy the movie's spectacular visual effects.

147,JohnWelles,Far from Perfect,5,10 April 2015,"""Jupiter Ascending"" (2015), directed by the Wachowskis, is an intergalactic science fiction film that seeks to provoke awe and exhilaration but falls short on both counts. The Wachowskis have struggled in the sixteen years since making the trend-setting ""The Matrix"" (1999), not quite recovering their reputation after the critically disappointing sequels and their financially-underwhelming films ""Speed Racer"" (2008) and ""Cloud Atlas"" (2012). This means ""Jupiter Ascending"", originally scheduled to be released in July 2014 but pushed back to January 2015 to complete the work on the computer generated special effects and to allow its studio Warner Bros., to mount a more effective marketing campaign, has so far struggled critically and commercially. It's not hard to see why either, with a clunky and exposition-filled opening that betrays a lack of confidence with its subject and further hampered by at times poor dialogue. The script, an original, is all plot and forward momentum, clearly influenced by a number of literary sci-fi sources including Frank Herbert's ""Dune"" series and some half-baked allegorising on capitalism. The Wachowskis' eagerness to create a blockbuster franchise means they rely too heavily on the expected genre traits of epic odysseys, with silent, brooding heroes (Channing Tatum) and hysterical, manic villains (Oscar-winner Eddie Redmayne, who alternates between quivering whispers and exploding uproar) with an ingénue female lead to be rescued and have the plot explained to (a rather wooden Mila Kunis).The script is an unsatisfactory mess that manages to conform to every expected reversal in the plot and the Wachowskis compound the feeling of familiarity with a quick editing rhythm (with Alexander Berner doing the actual cutting) that is redolent of many other mainstream action films. The only distinctive directorial set piece is an eight minute aerial battle over the dawn skies of Chicago that allows John Toll's cinematography to truly breathe and deliver a genuinely thrilling moment in a film that otherwise has little time for Toll's photographic magic. The other memorable sequence is when Kunis must claim the title to Earth from a galactic bureaucracy; it's a rare moment of humour in an otherwise po-faced filmed. The production design (by Hugh Bateup) and costume design (by Kym Barrett) is inventive and excellent, from a planet created with a Frank Gehry aesthetic to incorporating Ely Cathedral into the spaceship of Titus Abrasax (Douglas Booth in an amusing, self-deprecating performance, the best in the film). It's visually extraordinary but almost too much; combined with the unrelenting special effects, the rich textures become suffocating, especially when their isn't the script or characters to sustain it.In thinking the audience are engaged with its stolid characters, it fails to find any fun in itself, even when Sean Bean is supposed to be half man and half bee. Instead, we're left to dwell on its ephemeral pleasures, from the costumes and sets to Redmayne's twitching mannerisms and one well-done action scene. It's not enough to sustain the picture, leaving the film ultimately hollow and superficial; the Wachowskis were once renowned as original, visionary filmmakers, but now it seems they're as over-enamoured with special effects and franchise-building at the expense of depth as the rest of Hollywood.",Jupiter Ascending
148,tigerfish50,Cinderella in Space,1,27 November 2015,"The Wachowskis have made excellent small-scale movies in the past, but 'Jupiter Ascending' shows they're currently suffering from a serious case of pretension. The movie must surely be the most vacuous, mega-budget potboiler ever filmed, and it possesses a full cargo of bombastic baggage - ludicrous plot, pompous dialog, wooden acting, interminable action sequences, hammy heroes, black-hearted villains and a plucky heroine with royal DNA.No sane person could provide a coherent synopsis of this infantile fable. The story boils down to a Sci-Fi fairy tale about a Russian-American called Jupiter who works as a humble toilet cleaner in Chicago. After messengers from space arrive to tell her she's actually galactic royalty, this princess encounters an evil oligarch who rules an interstellar civilization from his base inside the Great Red Spot of Jupiter. This scoundrel derives his power from harvesting human beings to distill an elixir for eternal youth, and the Chicagoan Cinderella is the only person who can thwart his diabolical schemes. Anyone who can endure such fantastical drivel should salute Mila Kunis for her brave attempts to keep a straight face as she speaks Jupiter's fatuous lines, while being addressed as ""Your Majesty"".",Jupiter Ascending
149,lia00027,Nice Sci-fi Again By Wachowski brothers,9,9 February 2015,"I would say this is the best galaxy sci-fi movie after all these years (well actually after The Matrix trilogy). The story is good, the setting is amazing and epic, the effect visual is no doubt the best, the acting of the actors is decent.Jupiter Jones was a maid born when her father killed by robbery and her mother was a Russian with low education with poor income she never thought that she was in fact a reincarnation from a queen of the universe, to protect the earth and her family she chose to be the queen but the heirs of the queen were not accepting it well. Jupiter's life was in dangerous but a lycantant (a lycan mix breed) Caine a former legion/soldier of the universe saved her and vowed to always protect her with his own life even though he is a low species in the universe. Then their adventure began...For 2.45 hours I didn't realize time was running since the movie made me focus with all the action scenes and the great setting, even I find that the plot is not boring and unpredictable. The acting from Mila Kunis and Channing Tatum are decent since most scenes are required actions and fighting not all about dialog, but Mila was showing her emotion mostly through her eyes. The background sound was remaining me of old movies like star trek or the matrix time which seldom I get from today's movies (the feeling).Thanks for this great movie it's worth my time and money.",Jupiter Ascending
150,welhof1,Stunning and fast!,8,19 February 2020,8.5/10. I can't see why anyone would hate this movie? It definitely wasn't terrible. It's main flaw was that there was just too much content in it. Way too much to put into one movie.Plot was very interesting. The CGI? Wow! I've never seen anything like it. Mila Kunis is stunning as usual.I feel like a longer mini series where they deliver into the politics more would've been better.I loved it though.,Jupiter Ascending
151,abouhelier-r,Jupiter Ascending,7,8 February 2015,"In a bright and colorful future, a young destitute caretaker gets targeted by a ruthless son of a powerful family that live on a planet in need of a new heir, so she travels with a genetically engineered warrior to the planet in order to stop his tyrant reign. Jupiter Ascending is written and directed by the Wachowski's; it stars Channing Tatum, Mila Kunis, Eddie Redmayne, Sean Bean and Douglas Booth. I love the Wachowski's works since I saw (and understand) The Matrix for the first time, but to this day with Cloud Atlas in mind I was a little bit sceptical. In fact, they are able as always to deliver an appealing and interesting visual experience. The opening scene itself is mind-blowing, the score is fantastic and the special effects are awesome even if sometimes it feels very fake and entirely CGI/green screen inserted. Moreover, Channing Tatum is pretty good and functional in this movie but his BOOTS are far more interesting! Very good and original idea! Sean Bean is great as well. Unfortunately there's nothing more to say about the movie... It starts pretty strong and suddenly it becomes this two hours long story about who own the earth. Mila Kunis doesn't really embody the character and the level of emotion you can expect when all of sudden you're caught in the middle of all those incredible things. Depicting a very weak woman, who, in several scenes is about to sign her life and inheritance away basically. Then each time, Channing Tatum comes to save her when she thinks he's gone: the usual damsel in distress. She's not a strong character at all, a weak woman who can't care for herself. Plus her Earth family is not relevant at all, that's why when an ordinary person becomes a big thing they usually make this person orphan. Why? Because it's easier. I am a little disappointed by the script for this aspect and as well as the romantic dialogues are hilarious when their not supposed to be. Finally, Eddie Redmayne doesn't become relevant until the end of the movie. This guy is a very talented actor but as I was afraid of: whatever he was doing in this film... It doesn't work! It doesn't feel right at all! At last, this movie has incredibly breathtaking action scenes, it is visually very good but there's not enough substance behind it for a good movie. In the first act and then unfold on a long series of boring conversations with strange alien creatures and awful character design. Even the most dramatic and intense scenes are turned into hilarious moment (not only speaking of this weird elephant things). This film is mess that may be why it falls apart. It starts with impressive series of scenes then the script is not cohesive at all: things just happened (they go to space, they go here and there, talk to him and then to her, etc.). Overall Jupiter Ascending could have been so much more than just great mythology, concept and an amazingly grand scope. Dialogues and random scenes happening in the middle of more serious, political and emotional ones are taring the film down. At least it looks great and everybody did their part well enough.",Jupiter Ascending
152,stephendaxter,Visually stunning with some of the worst writing i have had to witness,3,21 April 2015,"This is the next Sci-fi film from the duo that bought us The Matrix, and you would assume that they can create a good, original sci-fi fantasy film that are hard to come by nowadays. But nope, they went ahead and created a movie with one of the most ridiculously, unbelievably messed up plots i have ever seen. For 90% of this movie i had absolutely no idea why anything was happening and the longer it went on the more confused i got, then they have moments where they try to explain what has happened so far and fill in any plot holes but by then you just don't care why and accept the fact that neither did the writers. The writers did absolutely nothing right with the script and the characters because every single problem lies within those fields. The plot makes you guess and assume too many things for way too long, and has so many characters that all mean absolutely nothing to you, they couldn't even get you to care about anyone except maybe a little bit for Mila Kunis. Actually i guarantee you that you will not remember a single characters name by the end of this film except for Jupiter, because everyone is under developed and not introduced well at all, oh, and you just don't give a crap. Where this film chose to spend its 2 hour runtime completely baffles me as to why on Earth you would spend so much time on Earth (pun intended), and while in space not focusing on anything interesting. You don't actually get off Earth until about 35 minutes into the movie and then when you do you are just as bored as when you were witnessing how shitty Jupiter's life is cleaning toilets. We want to see huge fast paced space battles with crap flying everywhere, now we do get that but only like 3 to 4 times during the film and the rest is filled with crappy dialogue between characters with no emotion and no chemistry. I don't think anyone is going to argue when i say that the visuals were amazing, the space environments were always a spectacle to look at. But the fantastic visuals and few entertaining action sequences are not enough to get me to like this film. All of the boring political talks and plot explanations just drag on and on and make absolutely no sense by the end. - 3.5/10",Jupiter Ascending
153,lnvicta,"Not for fans of substance, Jupiter Ascending is a glossy, entertaining, hot mess.",4,5 May 2015,"I'm not sure how to start this review so I'll just get right into it: This movie isn't good. It makes no sense. There is no room to get immersed in this world because there is no story to relate to. It's all just stuff happening; fluff. Beautiful, well made fluff mind you, but at its core this movie is a steaming hot mess.Here's the plot from what I gathered: Mila Kunis is suddenly the majesty of the Earth and has to protect it from a bunch of rich douchebags that live in Jupiter's atmosphere who want to use it for harvesting grounds or something. It's a dumb plot, and every scene that tries to move the plot forward is a scene wasted. The only interesting parts of this movie are the visuals and Channing Tatum's character, but even he is given absolutely no character development. He's just a badass space agent, or something. I don't even remember.The characters end up the same way they began - there was no journey to redemption or revelation for anyone. It was just do this, do that, stop this, go home, the end. And they try to include multiple stories, like Mila Kunis' relationship with her family (boooring); Caine (Tatum) and Stinger's (Sean Bean) history (wholly underdeveloped), the whole villain arc...The villains in this movie are spoiled brats. Seriously. They're not scary, they're not intimidating, there was no point in the movie where I was like ""oh man sh*t is about to go down""; there was just no intrigue. Their motives were all over the place. It's not worth trying to piece together every plot point they throw into the movie because it will just lead to confusion and disappointment, and eventually frustration when you realize how much potential was wasted in creating this massive universe. The lizards looked really cool. Why not have more of them? Oh we're just going to focus on the playboy brat now, okay.I really wanted to care about this universe. It has a Star Wars vibe in parts, like the ""royal"" wedding scene and the space battles, but there were no good characters to experience this adventure with. You're just watching things happen with no consequences, or at least none you cared about.The acting was fine in this movie. Channing Tatum and Sean Bean in particular gave great performances, and Eddie Redmayne as the primary antagonist was decent as well. Yeah, he's an Academy Award winner, and as much as I hate to say it I have not seen The Theory of Everything yet but I loved him in Les Mis so I was really hoping he would save this movie. Unfortunately the material he's given is absolute garbage, so in an effort to make the character stand out, Redmayne give him a weird, eerie, whisper voice that was akin to a hundred year old man trying to force words out from the back of his throat. But hey, I think it worked. The guy is completely unlikeable so might as well give him a unique trait to remember him by. Good on Mr. Redmayne because he succeeded. The only things I will remember about this movie are the cool visuals, the wasted potential, and his creepy voice.Don't see this movie. Unless you want to see some really great CGI for a couple hours, which can be found in much better places by the way, you won't find anything worth salvaging from Jupiter Ascending. It was a nice effort but ultimately a swing and a miss.",Jupiter Ascending

Some of the scenes went on too long, namely the fight scenes.Channing Tatum and Mila Kunis have absolutely zero chemistry together, in fact, I could have done without the love story completely, and I even feel that it ruined the film for me!I feel Eddie Redmayne was wasted in this role that anyone could have done, as it wasn't anything special.I know you can't spend ages in a film dwelling on it but I feel Mila Kunis' character, Jupiter, accepted things a bit too quickly and her concern for her mum and family was pretty much non- existent.The story definitely had potential and could have been better by perhaps getting rid of the love story, toning down on the visuals and getting better actors in the lead roles.I've seen it once; I see no need to watch it ever again!",Jupiter Ascending

156,rprince-832-6294,"Really messy, but not terrible.",7,22 February 2015,"-Jupiter Ascending (2015) movie review: -Jupiter Ascending is the latest, and probably final, big-budget sci-fi movie by The Wachowskis, creators of the Matrix. The film follows a normal girl who is made the target of the son of a powerful galactic dynasty. She is rescued by ex-space marine guy Channing Tatum, who tries to keep her safe for another member of the same family during the power struggle. Throughout the journey she starts to discover that she plays a much more important role than she thought.-Sounds messy? It is.-The story is really convoluted and jumps all over the place, making it hard to focus on anything really going on. Probably because it was written by The Wachowskis. AKA: writers of The Matrix Revolutions....-The pace was another problem the film had, as they just end up going from place to place to place like World War Z.-The acting was good. Everyone did fine and nobody was really bad.-The characters, and the dialogue, were pretty cheesy. And inconsistent. I thought it actually made Eddie Redmayne as the villain look bad in the film.-The music. Michael Giacchino was the star of the film for me. It was noticeable excellent! -The effects were a mixed bag. Some of the effects were Tron Legacy/Oscar good, while others reminded me of I, Frankenstein. Those two movies should not be in the same category. I did enjoy the majority of the vast effects and forgive the weaker ones. The Oscars won't, but I will.-The action was pretty sweet. The costume design was pretty sweet. The makeup/hairstyling was good. The practical effects were good. The alien-ish tech was cool. The aliens themselves were cool! However, literally everything I just listed has one or two moments that were really cheesy. A cheesy fight, a few cheesy costumes, etc.-I think one of the films biggest problems, and one that all of the others fall under, was that it did not know if it wanted to be serious or campy. Either say would have been better, but a blend of both did not work. Some funny scenes that did not fit the super-cool action, or an elephant alien among other human-ish cooler aliens. Also I see The Wachowskis went to the George Lucas school of making aliens.-All-in-all Jupiter Ascending was not all that good, but had some enjoyable things like the acting or space fights. Despite its flaws, I saw it for free and am glad I did, so I will say Jupiter Ascending is worth watching on Netflix. (When it inevitable comes to Nexflix)",Jupiter Ascending

159,lois-lane33,I thought it was just OK.,6,5 April 2015,There was a great deal of hype about this film maybe because its release had been pushed back significantly so they wanted people to still be interested in it when it came out. I thought it was reminiscent of a Walt Disney type of SF film. There was that 'ordinary people' meets 'the extraordinary' that often appears in family type SF. I thought Mila Kunis was good in it but I've never seen her in an unwatchable movie. I thought the special effects were not as great as I had hoped them to be. I thought the high level of detail in the special effects to only work sometimes-other times it was just too much to absorb causing me to lose interest in whatever film sequences they appeared in. The destruction of downtown wherever was not mind- blowing-it was mediocre due to an overabundance of special effects. Not a mind numbingly dumb movie but also not the ground breaking new SF it was touted as either. Go see it. I guess.,Jupiter Ascending
160,cadillac20,"An ambitious, epic universe marred by one dimensional characters and a stumbling script",6,3 February 2015,"When I give this film a 6, it's being a bit generous. Trying to put myself in other people's shoes, I'd say this film probably range anywhere from a 3 to a 5, and then there will be those who hate it. Still, I am likely to lean on the side of one of the few who likes the film. But it's a mixed bag. Sure enough, the special effects, action, and other elements are fantastic. But the film does little to develop it's own character beyond their archetypes and the script seems content to stay average at best.Jupiter Ascending actually paints a pretty fascinating sci-fi universe. As it turns out, Earth, and thousands of other worlds like it, are owned by a number of different families which act like corporations who seed these worlds. Once the worlds become over populated, their people are harvested to create a youth serum which keeps those living in the corporate society young for millennia after millennia. In this case, the Abraxis family is one of the most powerful and each of three heirs is vying for control of Earth. Standing in their way, however, is Jupiter Jones, who turns out to be the genetic reincarnation of the Abraxis' sibling's mother, and claimant to the throne of the family. If all of that sounds like a lot to take in, it is, and easily the best part of the film. The Wachowski's have a talent for creating fascinating worlds that feel complete. Here, they have created a massive sci-fi universe the likes of which we haven't seen in at least a decade, maybe longer. It's very clear that their ambition extends beyond just this one story. In fact, there are hundreds of fascinating stories that could be told about this universe. The idea of a corporate controlled universe is timely, and where we've seen this story played out before about the giant corporation versus the little guy, it's never quite been told on this scale. It's a shame then that this ambition is wasted on a story that doesn't seem to capitalize on such a universe. The story is good, but the script is lacking and the characters never really become all that interesting. They end up feeling like caricatures meant to introduce us to this world we've entered. They're histories are explained and they clearly have fleshed out back stories, but they feel almost lifeless in that they seem to be here only to be an aspect of this world and not a full character. Even as a lead character, Channing Tatum as Caine feels like little more than a body meant to perform choreography and defend Milas Kunis' Jupiter. At the very least, Jupiter is a sympathetic character who shows shades of change, but even she often feels like little more than a narrator meant to ask question for exposition purposes. Eddie Redmayne seems to have the juiciest part, and though he still seems to be a one dimensional villain, he shows emotional depth that the other characters lack. Most people I suspect will have trouble forgiving the lack of a truly meaningful script and characters that are too one dimensional. But the good news is that the film isn't a complete loss. The action, which the Wachowski's have proved to have a handle on, is fantastic. This is Star Wars level stuff, with space battles and well choreographed martial art duels. The cool tech thrown in, like the gravity boots, add some imaginative spice that once again shows the Wachowski's propensity for finding ways to justify making a 12 year old's imagination a reality. It's some truly fun stuff. Likewise, the world we're introduced to looks fantastic. The special effects make believable some very interesting and exciting details, such as the multitude of gadgets and weapons we're witness to. It's clear that the Wachowski's have set out to create a unique universe, and in my estimation, they have succeeded. I'm a sucker for this kind of world crafting, and so they get higher marks from me. Of course, I can see why the film was pushed back to the dumping grounds of February. This was meant to be a summer blockbuster, but up against so many big, successful films, it would have a hard time competing. I have the distinct feeling this is going to be a film that gets left behind this year, especially in favor of bigger films being released throughout 2015. Had the film been more focused on it's characters and less on exposition of the universe we're witnessing, then I feel it could have succeeded and become a modern sci-fi classic. But as is, it falls short. Honestly, I do hope for a sequel to this, if only to see this universe continue to get development. Perhaps a sequel would fulfill the ambition the Wachowski's clearly seek to build upon.",Jupiter Ascending

Her friend is better off than her and has apparently met her knight in shining armour. Her friend is really nervous about this. Jupiter witnesses her friend being molested by aliens one day and captures it on her i- phone. Jupiter does not really act surprised by this alien encounter. She knows that the aliens would never be interested in her any way. No one cares about her. One day her brother convinces her to sell her eggs so she can buy a telescope. Instead of taking her eggs, the doctors are actually aliens who've come to kill her. Presumably because she said how much she hated her life. Whoever sent the alien assassins must've thought he was doing Jupiter a favour. In the end, in fact, we do learn that he just wanted to do her favour.

163,Genti23,Unsurprisingly bad.,4,28 January 2016,"Jupiter Ascending is a 2015 Action,Adventure movie and rightfully considered as one of the worst of the year. The Wachowskis directed this mess and it truly showed.They over did the visuals and the story is so confusing and terrible and that mixed in with semi-good visuals makes for a boring and very terrible experience at the movies. Mila Kunis does a fine job even though her character,Jupiter Jones is one of the weakest characters of all time.She over relays on other people to save her all the time,and never truly does things herself.Almost the entire time she is treated as an object that people must own or use to get to what they actually want. Channing Tatum as Caine also does a fine job in the movie too but his character is also very underdeveloped and looks really weird/laughable. Eddie Redmayne portrays the villain in the movie named Balem Abrasax.He is absolutely the funniest part of the movie,though unfortunately that's all but intentional.He is a terrible villain with a terrible accent and terrible lines delivered.His motives are stupid and so is the character himself. The dialogue in this movie is laughably bad.Mila Kunis has some lines with Channing Tatum that not only did they make me laugh but also wonder as to what the heck happened to The Wachowskis. The story is confusing and just overall stupid and the final act is just plain bad.Even the visuals are terrible and the script doesn't help either.

164,paul_3-960-896774,Worth the watch,7,9 February 2015,"Once again, the Wachowskis are taking us into a world - I willing followed them - and it did not disappoint, not really. They managed to expand the universe as we know it, while making it very close to what we know. Nothing is too foreign or weird for the mind to grasp. It's Earth plus :). They limited the complicated lingo and very clearly created a story about inheritance and how families can tear each other apart for it. The science fiction, space opera and fairy tale aspect of the story only takes it to another level. The imagery and special effects in this movie are mesmerizing. It's aesthetic, futuristic, a bit weird but remains grounded. There is no doubt that Andy and Lana Wachowski can handle cinematography and special effects. The world they created for Jupiter Ascending is impressive and grand, clearly inspired by what we know and have on Earth while still feeling eerie and otherworldly. The action in the film is thrilling, whether Caine (Channing Tatum) is on foot or in a spaceship being chased or fighting hand-to-hand the action is breathtaking and easy to follow. It all makes the film entertaining to watch.But the movie suffers from a few bumps, that are a bit of pace problem and some less than amazing acting performances. The pace is checkered, sporadic, every time you get anxious for Jupiter or Caine things die down before picking back up again. They also did a crappy job with the trailers because some of the trailers clearly give away too much away. As for some of the performances, they're not as bad as previously advertised. Mila Kunis is lovable and very much grounds the movie while Channing Tatum introduces us to the enormity of this world. Eddie Redmayne made some bold character choices for his portrayal of Balem, I'm not sure they were the best for this movie but they somehow kind of work.In all Jupiter Ascending is a good movie, not great but good. It might be not worthy of what is expected from The Wachowskis, they can't always be groundbreaking, but they're good. They left the door open to possible sequel but I have the feeling that it won't be made.",Jupiter Ascending

It is not a cinematic extravaganza, but as a space soap opera it is very pleasant. Movie is visually stunning. It feels like Star Wars 1 meets Harry Potter. Channing Tatum is always worth to watch and there is something new in this story too. Of course some acts are extravagant and quite lame, but if you just want to relax and watch decent space action movie it really is worth to watch. If you want to tell something bad from this, then I can think few things. Film cutting is sometimes too fast and action scenes are mainly way too long. First I was going to watch this as 3D, but because of bad show times I was forced to watch it in 2D. When this will come out in BluRay, I might add my comments how 3D works on this. Many times these effect movies works well in 3D, I just have to wait to see it in home theatre. This movie is visually stunning although sometimes over acted with quite lame script. It is best to watch from big screen with lot of popcorn and soda and take it as a pure entertainment. Very well worth to watch if you can simply enjoy decent space soap opera.",Jupiter Ascending

Like Batman & Robin, The Room, Birdemic... Now you can also add this one to that list. I can't believe this is directed by the same people who directed The Matrix and Cloud Atlas. Some people call them a one hit wonder, but Cloud Atlas is actually incredible when you understand it. The idea could be cool if the writing wasn't so awful. And dialogues are even worse than the ones in the Star Wars prequels. That ""I love dogs"" line is even worse than ""I don't like sand"" in Attack of the Clones. Even tho this movie has good actors, it's full of terrible performances. Tatum is horrible, Kunis is horrible, and Redmayne was the funniest thing ever! I was actually entertained during his scenes because he was so funny. That's like the funniest example of overacting ever and the least menacing villain ever. He and the effects are the reason I gave this movie a 2. He wasn't good, but that's the point! He was so terrible he kept me entertained! The others were just wooden. And if you expect a strong female lead, you're looking at the wrong place because she just keeps falling into hands of bad guys and waiting to be saved! Bella Swan and Anastasia Steel are stronger!

170,EmmaDinkins,Chix Chat on Film review: When worlds collide.,7,10 February 2015,"I was excited about seeing this film although I do recall last year that the chatter about it was less than favorable. My thinking was, how bad could it be coming from the Wachowski's who had given us the The Matrix trilogy? Jupiter Jones (Mila Kunis) works in a domestic capacity and basically hates her life. I thought the opening backstory of her birth and life was a bit lengthy, however it did paint a drab picture so that you could understand her distaste for her circumstances. When things did get moving it seemed like chase scene after chase scene, out of which two important factors became known. I had always wondered why no one ever remembers when aliens destroy major cities and how they are rebuilt so quickly and finally the mystery of crop circles has been solved. I feel like it is getting redundant to complement first rate special effects, because that is becoming the new normal. If a film has poor special effects, then that is when I will have to go in. But here it is, the special effects were Tony the Tiger great. The acting was top shelf as well, I wasn't really familiar with Eddie Redmayne (Balem Abraxas) until recently during Award season with his best actor nod for The Theory of Everything, but this dude is off the chain. I will say this, if you don't like your life you should consider that you might end up taken to another world drawn into a power struggle for the planet earth, manipulated, lied to and on a galactic hit list. I actually liked the film, although there were times that it failed like how the civil bureaucracy run around almost put me to sleep. This was seriously a when worlds collide story, but for me it worked.",Jupiter Ascending
171,tkarlmann,This is a wonderful feast for the eyes and your mind!,10,24 September 2021,"DO NOT believe the so-so or negative reviews of this film! This film is an example of some of the purest Science Fiction I have seen. It rivals some the paperback books I've read. I has an utterly incredible scope. But the tremendous scope does NOT obliterate the Film's Hero from saving ""Your Majesty"" (Read: his cutie) -- who, get this -- cleans toilets for a living! Really. It has Good-Guys, and some Bad-Guys that would make our Earthly petty tyrants look like Boy Scouts.The CGI is immersive, but it does not seem overdone -- as the immense Scope of this film kind of demands it.It has heroes, maidens, space ships of literally all shapes & sizes, soldiers, ray-guns, reptilian thugs, robots, enhanced humans, Portals in space to pop through, and the coolest pair of roller-skates/skateboard you can imagine; and Drug Peddlers so bad that they need to ""harvest"" 100 people to make one tube of Goo that, get this, allows Them to live longer!The only thing this film lacks is all the BS-Marketing hype that was there for 'other' Sci-Fi ventures, like Star Wars.Definitely worth your time!!!",Jupiter Ascending
172,rcolgan,It has ambition. It's just a shame it doesn't have anything else.,4,4 July 2015,"I've always seen the Wachowski's as very hit and miss when it comes to their films. On the one hand they've made some incredible work like The Matrix and the highly underrated Cloud Atlas. But they've also had some bad movies like the Matrix sequels and Speed Racer. However they have never made something quite as bad as Jupiter Ascending. The film seems to fail at everything, creating dull undeveloped characters and placing them in a ridiculous world that feels like it's trying to show how dumb science fiction can get. The story is bizarre to say the least. Our lead Jupiter discovers that she is an exact genetic copy of the mother of a group of intergalactic nobility and thus the rightful owner of earth. Because of this her genetic children come at her each with their own insane plans including trying to kill her, forcing her to sign away her rights to the planet and marrying her (yes, one of her genetic children tries to marry their mother). The only thing stopping them is an ex half wolf military hunter Caine Wise who can track her through smell over the universe. The story is all over the place and is needlessly complex leading to a lot of the story being so boring and rushed that you'll forget about most of it 5 minutes after watching it. Beyond this I just can't take the world they try to create seriously. It has so many bizarre things that sound more like something you'd hear from a crazy conspiracy theorist on the street. Like the government being able to somehow erase the memories of the entirety of Chicago when a fight spreads across the city. Dinosaurs were made extinct on earth and the surviving dinosaurs were taken into space and made slaves. Bee's are designed to recognise royalty. Why a studio would give 170 million dollars to ideas this ridiculous I have absolutely no idea...And in this bizarre world we also get a lot of dumb characters, who are all underdeveloped due to the film favouring to give exposition about the world than building up its characters. Firstly there's Mila Kunis as Jupiter. She is the exact opposite of cool action heroes like Ripley as in spite of being the film's lead all she does in the film is be kidnapped, ask expository questions and wear weird clothing. On top of which she has no reactions to anything. When she discovers aliens exist her reaction is the same as if she were to have been told that it was a little windy today. Sean Bean plays an ex soldier who was spliced with the DNA of a bee (and yes, many people have already made the Sean Bee joke). His entire role in the film seems to be nothing but give some exposition. And Channing Tatum, who's not bad in the film but is so bland a character that I can't remember anything about him other than that he's a wolf hybrid who likes to sniff stuff and rides rocket skates. And then there's Redmayne. Oh Redmayne, what happened? I went from watching your incredible transformation in The Theory of Everything to you giving an over the top performance which lives up to the silliness of the likes of John Travolta in Battlefield Earth and Nicholas Cage in Wickerman. He seems to lose complete control of his vocal chords in the film going from near inaudible whispering to suddenly bellowing random sentences. He's the most entertaining part of the film, but for all the wrong reasons as I can hardly stop myself from bursting into laughter any time he's on screen. Even the action sequences are weak with the Wachowski's mostly favouring generic CGI heavy fight scenes over the kind of kung fu action and revolutionary practical and computer generated effects that made them a household name in the matrix. It's not even good CGI mostly being a series of random explosions and filling the scene with ships, to the point I could hardly see what was going on. The only compliment I can give to this film is that it's imaginative in the designs of the costumes and characters which are creative. Other than that it's just a dreadfully written space opera that's only entertainment value relies solely on just how absurdly awful it is.",Jupiter Ascending
173,rjsf96,An Exhilarating Beginning to a New Science-Fiction Super Saga,6,3 March 2015,"Now that 'Jupiter Ascending' is fast approaching three weeks of being shown in wide release, it will come as no shock that the critical response has been less than positive. Universally panned and reviled, even Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun Times claimed it would be sure to land on his list of the Top 10 Worst Films of 2015. But fear not. Since 'The Matrix' sequels almost anyone has thought of The Wachowski's as talentless hacks and now that they are trying something creative, original and different, no-one wants to give them credit.'Jupiter Ascending' stars Mila Kunis as Jupiter, she is a cleaner and longing for some adventure in her life. Her meagre and pointless existence is interrupted by the skilled Caine Wise a half human – half wolf genetic hybrid. Who is played with ferociousness and assured confidence by the reliable Channing Tatum. Wise tracks Jupiter down, just in time to stop her untimely demise. Wouldn't it make a change for the hero to arrive a minute late?Jupiter is eventually revealed to be a Queen in another universe and so Wise invites her aboard his spaceship. Not before a high speed chase ensues during which Wise uses his jet boots to exhilarating effect. They allow him to float across the ground and reach astonishing heights with great agility. Here the Wachowski's revel in all the minute details whenever a battle takes place. The camera swings around as if unsupported and weightless. This gives off a feeling of freedom and control which is sorely lacking in other action films like 'Taken 3' for example which is poorly edited and shot like a three year old shaking a camera around to make an audience hurl. There are plenty of action scenes in Jupiter Ascending but the truly amazing thing is that they never get drawn out or tired.Later, Jupiter is brought before Sean Bean's character that was apparently given the name Stinger Apini at birth. His parents must have really hated him. Apini bows before her and believes that she is royalty. The universe in which Wise shows Jupiter borrows a large amount of beats from other more popular and vastly populated universes such as 'Star Wars' and 'Star Trek'; but still works as a product on its own.What is becoming more and more common is a lack of original ideas. Yet, 'Jupiter Ascending' has many and gets as much mileage as it can out of them all. Even if a few miss their intended targets. Once the plot does kick in it is effective and we learn the true and troublesome nature of the other species on these colourful worlds. (The aliens look very similar to humans). They want to harvest Earth so that the organisms can enter a ""Darwinian state of perfection"". They use the harvesting process as a means of extracting a substance from humans that means that the aliens will never grow old. If Blofeld occupied a Science Fiction world his plot would be exactly the same. The family of Abrasax and the descendants all want one thing or another to do with Jupiter so that they will be crowned King and ruler of the universe; whether that be by becoming best friends, married or eliminating her from the picture altogether. If this sounds tiresome, trust me it is not.There are many other factors that contribute to 'Jupiter Ascending' being a winner in its own right. The CGI is a marvel and apparently prevented the film from opening on its intended July 2014 date. If this is true then I'm glad the film was postponed and is nothing like the tacky CGI in the latest 'Transformers' flick. The set design is stylised and warrants high praise. Almost to the point where it seems that Wes Anderson had involvement in it. The music by Michael Giacchino is a soaring spectacle that lends itself perfectly to the pristine cinematography. It is also the composer's best work since 'The Incredibles'. The film is furthermore fast paced and never leaves us watching the hands upon our watch. We are flung from one set piece to another as we watch in utter credulity with the craft and skill with which 'Jupiter Ascending' was made.But like any action flick or science fiction spectacle it has its fair share of flaws. Regarding the character of Jupiter, she really should be much stronger than she is. As she is continuously saved by Wise and I would have liked to see her become more independent and grow as a character. She is referred to throughout the film as ""the chosen one"". It would be nice to see the Wachowski's try something different with the tried and tested formula. That is more than just changing the lead's gender.Unfortunately Eddie Redmayne who at the time of typing this won a Best Actor Oscar for 'The Theory of Everything' is dismal and a disgrace. He talks softly which is fine, but when he gets angry he shouts and screams to the point where I thought I was watching a comedy. I would not be surprised if he won a Razzie Award for Worst Supporting Actor – no doubt he will be crying himself to sleep in a years' time.'Jupiter Ascending' is clearly not a film for everyone. It has met an extremely negative response and unjustly so. For the average film goer they may be angered at its leisurely run time and many fight scenes. But for the sci-fi faithful they will gaze with grace at a film that outshines its rivals. With its spectacular score, glorious cinematography, strong CGI, original storytelling and enthralling fights. Be sure to venture to the other side of the galaxy if needs be to watch this enticing science fiction fairy-tale.",Jupiter Ascending
174,GwydionMW,Really boring introduction,4,26 December 2015,"A wholly needless set-up for the character's birth lost me. The human background is needless and also not likable. By the time the rather interesting action began, I was already despising the film as a complete mess.Some of the later effects were quite good. But undermined by camp and improbable characters everywhere.And a premise that is just as absurd as The Matrix. People have sinister plots for no good reason. Use humans where pigs ought to be just as suitable (in both films).And no one is competent with weapons, so we keep having lots of hand to hand combat. A waste of good Special Effects.",Jupiter Ascending
175,vistheindian,Reaching for too much,6,9 February 2015,"Quickie Review:Jupiter Jones (Mila Kunis) is an ordinary woman stuck being a maid, cleaning toilets for life. She is thrown into extraordinary circumstances when discovering that she is the heir to planet Earth. Soon, Jupiter is forced into a power struggle with the remaining chain of inheritance of the cosmos. Jupiter Ascending is the latest attempt by the Wachowskis to recapture the success they had with The Matrix trilogy. There is a lot to like about this movie, visually it is stunning and the universe that is built is rich in detail. However, the film gets so caught up in the details that as a whole the story gets unnecessarily convoluted. Nevertheless, Jupiter Ascending is a passable sci-fi fantasy to experience on the big screen.Full Review:Over the past decade the Wachowskis have had a lot of misses. It has caused many including myself to suspect that The Matrix may be the exception rather than the rule on their ability to make a great film. So I'll admit I had very low expectations for this one.There is one thing that will be undisputed amongst everybody, visually Jupiter Ascending is gorgeous. The art design from planets, to ships, to costumes are beautifully crafted and unique from anything I've seen before. Then there are the action set pieces that were very well shot, delivering a lot of intensity to the chases and shoot outs. These were the scenes where I had the most fun, and watching it in IMAX was worth it for the immersion. I must say the universe created for the film, with the trade systems, species, and the worlds, is impressively diverse. You can tell there is a lot of backstory to how this universe functions. I wouldn't mind reading a book about even because of its depth, but this leads me to what doesn't work with the film.Simply put, there is a lot of exposition about the trading systems, bureaucracy, and politics. It gets to the point where there is a collections of scenes dedicated to showing Mila Kunis going from one office to another trying get her inheritance. Even when that's done, the supporting cast spend significant time explaining their involvement rather than just showing it. Another frustration I had with the film was the rinse and repeats of the same sequence of events three times: Jupiter is kidnapped, exposition by supporting character, Jupiter rescued by Caine (Channing Tatum). Three times! Finally, the biggest wasted potential of the movie, Eddie Redmayne. We know he is an incredible actor from Theory of Everything, but here he is reduced to a botox lipped generic villain with an absent middle to his mood spectrum. He will be whispering ever so lightly then he would explode into a raging scream in a millisecond. I'm sorry but that's laughable, not menacing.There has been a lot of negativity online about this movie, and as you can see I haven't pulled back my punches on the negatives either. In the end, it is still a watchable movie with some entertaining set pieces and great visuals. Jupiter Ascending is not revolutionary, but it is also not a disaster. Best way to describe it is through my friend's first reaction, ""not as bad as I expected,"" yet that doesn't make it great.Check out more on my movie review blog The Stub Collector: http://thestubcollector.wordpress.com/",Jupiter Ascending
176,rmarkd,"great visuals, but dull story",6,13 June 2020,"Jupiter Ascending is a story about a woman named Jupiter (Mila Kunis). Her dad was killed when she was a baby and she lives with her mom and some relatives. Jupiter cleans houses for a living, hates her life, and longs to spend about $4000 on a telescope. She decided to sell her eggs for the money.While in the medical office, turns out the doctors are hired alien killers who are about to kill her but she's saved at the last moment by hunter-space-speedskater Caine Wise (Channing Tatum). Turns out she's royalty because bees like her.She's promptly kidnapped by other aliens, but Caine is able to jump aboard the ship at the last moment. They drop her off in an alien world to meet the first of three siblings, who are heir to a group of planets. Yeah, turns out these aliens are humans, and humans all around the universe -- including earth -- are basically farms. We are turned into goo and these alien humans get to extend their life,Jupiter is captured again, Caine is thrown into space only to be saved at the last moment. Jupiter almost gets married to sibling number 2 only for Caine to stop the wedding at the last moment. I should mention at this point that, somehow, Jupiter is the reincarnation of the mother of the three siblings. Yeah... eww.She goes back home only to find her family has been taken hostage by piggy #3. He wants her to abdicate her rights as the owner of Earth. She refuses and is about to be killed, but is saved by Caine at the last moment. Some action stuff happens and she almost falls to her death, but is saved by Caine at the last moment.Story ends with her cleaning the toilets, but now loving her life, knowing she owns the Earth, or something like that.So, the good: the visuals. The Wachowskis paint a beautiful and creative universe. There's also a Brazil-esque scene about bureaucracy of becoming official royalty, which was cute. Kunis and Tatum have good chemistry between them.The bad: the story is just dull and convoluted. It's a nice concept, but the execution is unnecessarily complicated and they spend too much time setting things up. The space-skating is neat the first couple times, then gets tiresome after. The special effects action sequence is just too over the top, at least for my tastes.It reminds me of Valerian -- good visuals, but little else. At least Jupiter ascending had good chemistry between the two leads and the story was better than Valerian, but in both cases, it just seemed like they built a great universe and squandered what they put together. 6/10",Jupiter Ascending
177,graham-harvey,Disappointing,4,15 July 2021,"There is a certain intelligence to this film & yet equally a certain banality
Inclusivity is a component with many different roles & characters & yet the heros remain in the traditional restricted history of strength winning the day with white men in the leading roles. Once again western imperialist culture rules as the best, not just in the world, but now the universe,
There are so many stereotypes in this film. It belongs to film making 5 decades ago, not the modern era.Upper class is bad while ordinary American accents are good. And thus hoodwinking of the masses is achieved. As long as people appear democratic & equal they are good, yet such limited ways of thinking cause leaders to do bad stuff while marketing themselves as one of the team.Reptilian monsters that wreak havoc? Again? Elixr extracted from human harvesting so others can live forever- again?Explosions bigger than ben hur & yet somehow the good characters survive!Ultimately grunt & violence is what wins the day.

178,jonnytheshirt,Fun enough pop corn ride,6,23 February 2015,"Alas there won't be a sequel as this was a fun enough Sci-fi romp. Pretty epic in it's aspirations this was obviously an intended springboard for future installments. The movie had a good cast (despite those ears on Cain) including our now Oscar winning villain (a very intense Eddy Redmayne) and was quite self aware with some good one liners not taking themselves too seriously. There was a bit of mish mash of Sci-fi ideas however and the mixture of some compelling screen ideas and some rather terrible shots indicated the missing links in the collaboration with their production house the sibling directors had. Those reptiles straight out of Dragonlance were just odd, but the leads were very watchable and the background and potential for the world that will never get fleshed out was interesting enough, despite a few too many 'saved at the last second' moments - these should be used sparingly. I did enjoy quite a few laughs and there were plenty of eye watering action moments if that's your thing. This will always be remembered unfortunately as a big budget gone wrong.",Jupiter Ascending

Imagine ten dots, and every dot is connected in complex ways, both individually and as a whole. If you haven't read, and studied, every dot explained by Herbert in elaborate detail, you will fail to understand not only the forest for the trees, but the trees for the forest. You will feel as if you are trying to access a vision whose elaborate magnificence has been sabotaged and compromised by the self-absorption of the creators of it all. In Jupiter Ascending, we only experience a convoluted mess, unfortunately similar to Matrixes 2 and 3. Matrix 1 was as good as Terminator, Alien, The Thing and all the archetypal standards. Why was this so hard for the Wachowski pair to repeat? This movie is like every season of Game of Thrones compressed into one amorphous blob, incoherent, lugubriously banal and incomprehensible malcontent, for the sake of being irreverently avant-garde. And yet, like the Matrix sequels Jupiter Ascending refuses to be turned off. The special effects, the action scenes, the alien gesticulations, Sean Bean, all result in a fun ride, well worth exactly one bottle of fine wine and seven bong tokes in. With these auxiliary items, you will enjoy this movie.",Jupiter Ascending

But despite that I gave it a shot having low expectations.I actually liked it. Sure it was rough in some places. The relationship between Mila Kunis and Channing Tatum didn't seem real (more like cold).But you have to understand what they were shooting for. It's a very ambitious science fiction fantasy movie. It reminded me a bit of Dune (the book and movies). The special effects were great. A lot of action.

183,marydm-43470,What a ride!,10,6 April 2020,"Rotten Tomatoes are just that: pretty bloody rotten. Their critics are more concerned about turning out quips and smarty pants phrases than the substance of what they're supposed to be reviewing. Hell, Hamlet is the messiest longest most rambling plot of all. But that doesn't mean the Bard is all of a sudden going to be given 3/10 stars. Critics love to dig into what they hate without respect for the effort involved. And some movies are bad enough to be panned, because their bad faith is so loud and clear. Jupiter Ascending, like Lynch's maligned version of Dune, and Fincher's denigrated Alien 3, packs more cinematic punch in each scene than the whole of the childish and literal minded Star Wars opus. Some viewers look for linear narrative structures and literal plots, forgetting that film, as a predominantly audiovisual medium tells stories through images and sounds. Jupiter Ascending creates a fabulous universe visually. It is far more inventive and imaginative in this regard than many ""classics"" of the genre. I couldn't take my eyes off the screen the whole time, for dear of missing some glorious imahe. Thank God we have streaming services these days, so we can go back and be stunned repeatedly with the images. The narrative premise of earthlings being farmed for the ""elixir of youth"" the aliens prize is no less valid and convincing than the Atreides/Harkonnen rivalry over the Arrakis spice in Dune or the Xenomorph/Engineers as the seeders of earth life in the Alien/Prometheus saga. We, humans, farm many species for resources we consider valuable; why would the planet wide farming premise of the movie be any more weird? It's just a matter of scale, not principle. The script is funny and tongue in cheek, and the two protagonists as well as the motley crew of villains are more than adequately sketched, Tatum, Kunis, Redmayne etc obviously having a ball playing them. Kunis has come a long way from the small screen, she's as good here as she was in Black Swan. The editing provides a crackling pace, even when the plot meanders into secondary story lines. It's an epic, FHS, have you everseen an epic from the Iliad to GOT without secondary storylines? Not even going to touch on the gender of the directors, critics who resort to such irrelevant approaches to crit show their true colours clearly enough. We never say ""male directors"" why should we say ""female directors""? Does that somehow change the critical parameters for a work of art, any work of art? We, in the progressive, civilised West, have a long way to go here. 10 stars for a rollicking, crackling, fast-paced, fun, visually stunning sci-fi flick. Which, on top of all this parodies human values and foibles, like Star Trek's Vulcan greeting, ""live long and prosper"", that most human aspiration of all.
Bravo to all involved.",Jupiter Ascending

185,fdbjr,Flash Gordon and Ming the Merciless Transformed to 2014 - SPOILERS,8,7 February 2015,"Jupiter Ascending is not incoherent or a mishmash or anything of the kind. What it is, is an almost direct descendant of the Edgar Rice Burroughs, Robert E Howard or Flash Gordon tropes (if you remember those) and other impossibly naive science fiction of that type. We have an Evil Emperor Family (and they are amazingly evil - they make Ming and his slaves, death rays, and ant-men look like St. Francis of Assisi), an undiscovered Queen of the Universe, and assorted good and bad guys. This is straight out of the pulp fiction of the 30's, unvarnished.All of which is a long winded way of saying I had a whale of a good time at this absolutely silly, but endearing movie. I bought my popcorn, suspended all critical faculties, and watched the yarn unfold. On its own terms, it was straightforward fun. The critics who hate the movie are the ones who actually thought 'The Matrix' series was making a serious statement about something. (It wasn't - it was as silly as this movie, but a helluva a lot more ponderous and leaden. Ditto 'Cloud Atlas', which managed to convert a novel of marvelous feel and subtlety into a clodhoperish exercise in faux solemnity.And especially ditto 'Interstellar'. I liked that also as a space opera, but I could do without the feeling that I should genuflect in the aisle before I take my seat. The highbrows will keel over, but this is a much more genuine and entertaining movie than that one).Now for the spoilers. Spoiler one - there is only one scene that smacks of art, but it was terrific. The girl is a member of a down and out Russian émigré family that makes its living cleaning houses, toilets a specialty. Rescued from near assassination by the lycanthropic hero, she goes with him to a dilapidated house in the country, unpainted these thirty years, big overgrown garden, that sort of thing. While there, the bees begin to surround her, at first to her dismay, but then . . . They respond with swarming obedience to her gestures. Delighted, she swings her arm this way, then that, and they follow her lead. The hero's friend explains that bees are one of the few creatures who by genetic chance recognize royalty. The scene is less than a minute long, but it is terrific.Second spoiler - at the end of the movie, the girl turns down unimaginable wealth and power to be with her family and we see her once again cleaning toilets.(You read that right - I'm not kidding.). She's still queen, with all the perks, that's just what she chooses to do. But she has picked up a boyfriend - an incredibly miscast Channing Tatum (though I do have to add in fairness that Channing Tatum in my opinion is miscast in just about everything). So she joins him at the top of this Chicago building to do a little weekend anti-grav skiing. As she adjusts her anti-grav boots, preparing to step out into thin air, she looks up at Wolf Guy and asks, with complete seriousness, ""What do you think my family would say if they knew I owned the Earth?""(Well, what the hell do you THINK they'd say, sweetheart?)That second spoiler pretty well sums up Jupiter Ascending - impossible to take seriously, impossible to dislike. I had a lot more fun with this piece of retro science-fiction than the religious exercises of 'Interstellar', '2001', or the increasingly ponderous Star Wars franchise. It probably wasn't intended as an homage to old fashioned pulp fiction, but that's the way it worked out - the same appeal as 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' - a comparison that will make the high brow guys keel over, but they are experts in thinking within the box.Bottom line is that I think most people reading this will have a good time at this movie, taken on its own terms. Just be sure you buy enough popcorn.So eight stars. If the writer/directors could have contrived a scene where Mila Kunis takes off her clothes, it would be ten. But you can't have everything.",Jupiter Ascending

So you people that love Romantic Comedies do not judge this because it is not your cup of tea. Now to the real mess: The cast was very well picked! all the evil you can handle and one girl with a hero doing everything he can to write the wrongs into a right! I love this movie just because of the philosophy and that is why it did very, very, very well in CHINA! But it seems that someone paid some people to slap bad publicity to this movie because it came out along side other movies at the box office. Oligarchy of our country is saturated with thugs and mobsters with deep pockets controlling our entertainment and our industries thus why this movie tanked in the USA, Give this movie another chance and watch it completely! Do not miss a single moment because every second explains the next and the scenes are wrapped up so perfectly that you will figure out why they mentioned or combined certain takes. I commend the cast and crew of this movie! What a great writer! a great Producer and what a good director managing thousands of crew members to do this perfect movie! When you think about it I have seen near perfect graphics , sound and actors but terrible writing and cuts that I just gave 3 to 4 stars but this one did not lack any information! I am begging for a sequel because there are so many unanswered questions, like where is the base located that rebuilds catastrophes? I am also up in arms on the planets she owns! She supposedly owns the whole galaxy! And with the son dead she is in charge of all the production but chances are the other son and daughter is snatching it up and have become stuarts of her estate. The sequel will probably focus on us being cows for the slaughter again but this time the Son that died probably promised the whole earth would be processed to a large consortium of investors that will do anything to invade earth due to a contract that was made and not accomplished. So this would be very interesting what they will do and I hope the same writers are back on the sequel. Praying for this sequel that really needs to answer the questions we have from the last. Hopefully the second time around will grow an occult following that will then push for a orgin Story made into a TV show or cartoon. We can only hope.",Jupiter Ascending

191,drael64,A fantastic ride,10,23 February 2015,"Often IMDb has the rating pretty bang on. Even if I like the film more than others do. The current average however is unfair to this film. This is much better than any of the transformers movies, or twilight etc. It is in part a love story, and thats not so much my thing. But it is also a deep, compelling rich imagined universe, with expansive ideas, and a wild entertaining action ride. It's not as serious a film as a lot of the Wachowski siblings's other great films (Matrix, Matrix:reloaded, Animatrix, Cloud atlas, V for vendetta), in terms of its allusions, social references and philosophical meanings, although there are still interesting allusions and references to be had here, many of which are central to the plot - if you know about these ideas, you'll notice. If you don't it won't matter.This movie is more of a ride. It has a nice balance of dialogue/plot, and action. The action is exciting. There is a lot of visual spectacle, and the actors, while not as amazing as some of the acting in atlas, do a competent job, bearing in mind this is an entertainment action sci-fi film. Its compelling enough in the characters that you care, but not so dramatic, it distracts from the simplicity of an interesting action story. So you might walk away stimulated by a few interesting ideas, but rather than this being in the forefront, as with say cloud atlas, its very much in the background. The story is easy to follow, and its an entertaining movie. Even channing is surprisingly good. Maybe his acting is getting better. I did enjoy those other movies they made better, I must admit, I am a cerebral guy, and I like a movie that works with that.But this is no transformers, nor third matrix film, its a solid enjoyable film, with good action, relateable characters and themes, hateable villains and a lot of really enjoyable visual spectacle. Where cloud atlas was their 'indie' project, this is a mainstream sci fi flick, its accessible while still being deeply imaginative.",Jupiter Ascending
192,brent_or,Missed Potential of the Beautiful and Enjoyable Kind,6,9 March 2015,"The negative reactions to this film were strong, and the criticisms were valid. But looking at Jupiter Ascending on the whole, it strikes me as more of a mixed bag than an utter failure. Yes, it could have used some editing, is sometimes incoherent and is a bit shallow on the character development front. But if what one sees here is the distorted, rippling surface of a universe, it is still a personable, engaging and of course extraordinarily gorgeous universe. This is light years away from being a soulless, empty spectacle full of gratuitous VFX. It is quite the opposite. Pity that we will likely not see more of it.Basically, Jupiter Ascending is a wild space opera that plays something like Snow White-meets-The Fifth Element-meets-The Matrix. It is full of crazy aliens, beautiful cosmic shots, sublimely stylized spacecraft and plenty of internal mythology. Is it a mess? Yes. But frankly, there is not all that much between Jupiter Ascending and Guardians of the Galaxy, aside from the former leaning towards romance and the latter towards comedy. Both are frequently wacky space spectacles. Guardians is certainly better, but if it merited being one of the highest grosses of the year--I would say yes, simply based on the enjoyment-factor-- then Jupiter at least merited a solid showing. But the art of courting audiences plays to curves and chasms that are rarely fair.The question was raised, in the wake of this film's commercial failure--should sci-fi fans go see a bad film just to encourage more original films of similar type? I don't think so. A film needs to succeed because it is good, and directors should not be rewarded for sub-par work. But I do wish that more people would have given Jupiter Ascending a chance, because while the Wachowskis made some mistakes with it, they still managed to deliver something unique and enjoyable. I would very much like to see more films like this.",Jupiter Ascending

I cannot believe that $200 million could be pissed up the wall so spectacularly without someone, anyone, noticing that this production was going so, so wrong.There is so much wrong with the film it would be quicker to watch it rather than read a list of the specific issues but generally everything was awful: Casting, acting (especially Kunis and Tatum), set design, costumes (OMG the costumes), the plot, the characters, the dialogue, topless Tatum flying through space on flying rollerblades, EVERYTHING.I have also never seen a movie that cost so much look so cheap. Some of the CGI was great but outside of the scenes created in post it looks like no-one had any interest in lighting or cinematography at all.HOWEVERThis movie is such a monumental car crash, that like with a car crash, it's difficult to look away.

194,DJRMewzique,An Embarrassment of Riches!,3,7 February 2015,"and what I mean by that is that this is a film about rich people that is just an embarrassment.""Jupiter Ascending"" is the latest film from the Wachowskis and, despite what you read about their under-rated previous efforts (""Speed Racer,"" ""Cloud Atlas""), this one truly is.utter disaster.Remember when Hollywood seemed to start putting effects ahead of stories and starting insulting the viewers intelligence until some directors (read: Cameron, Nolan) started injecting mindblowing effects into incredibly intelligent stories.Well, guess who is insulting our intelligence again.What this movie is ""about,"" and I use the term loosely, is a young woman in Chicago who cleans toilets for a living who finds out she is actually a genetic descendant of the most powerful dynasty in the universe and simply needs to claim Earth as her own, which she left to herself thousands of years prior, before her ""son"" harvests humans to make a potion that keeps other beings in the universe young You got that? No? Who cares.The entire film is completely about special effects and scene after scene that shows elements ripped off directly from any one of the Star Wars films. It is clear the entire film was thought of from the perceptive of ""how could we get this cool scene in the film?"" with very little focus on a story that is chronologically and logistically ridiculous.Case in point: Jupiter Jones, played by Mila Kunis, in the span of about 24 hours, finds out that aliens exist, that she is galactic royalty impervious to the sting of bees and survives the most ridiculously unlikely air-chase ever shown on screen without a seat belt.without even batting an eyelash or one moment of hyperventilating. I mean, I think most of us would freak out to actually meet an alien, first and foremosteven a muscular, hot one in the form of Channing Tatumnever mind the rest of what was thrown at her. Yet, she takes it in stride, like it is completely normal.Absurd.Truly, the entire narrative rolls out like thiswith space, time and basic logic (and gravity) being completely ignored in the development of a story so completely ridiculous, Oscar-front-runner Eddie Redmayne must be crying himself to sleep for accepting to be a part of this and giving such a silly performance. In June 2014, when this film's release was pushed back by almost seven months from July 2014 to February 2015, what they should have done was rewritten the script.On the upside, the film is visually stunning, and they certainly used 3D technology to their advantage, not to mention that Tatum's extended shirtless scene is, indeed, very entertaining while I don't think I have ever seen Mila Kunis look so beautiful. Unfortunately, she is at her best when she is dressed to the nines as a total rip off of Padmé.",Jupiter Ascending
195,DunkelheitVZ,Harry Potter in space wannabe,3,26 June 2015,"It has been a long time that I have seen a movie as bad as ""Jupiter Ascending"". I love Science Fiction, I love the Wachowskis, but this was disgrace for all those involved. Where do I start? The acting of Mila Kunis is bad. She is unbelievable as princess and even more unbelievable as toilet maid. All characters are stereotypes that you have already seen in dozens of movies. There is no character development, literally nothing of interest is going on. There is no life in the characters, you don't feel for anyone. And this makes the action, albeit well choreographed, very boring. Speaking of which (the action), many reviewers see the action and the cinematography as some kind of pro-argument. I beg to differ. There is so much CGI and it is unbelievably colorful and fancy, you cannot really feel for anything. As an example: During the attack to attempt a rescue of the princess, the whole fight outside of the big ship feels completely lifeless. When the camera is showing the pilots, it does not make any difference if they are flying straight or fighting for their lives, the movement of their hands and the pictures, everything looked the same. Everything looks like a very stylish video game and not like a story that wants to suck you in. The spaceships are so creative, they look like a wallpaper and not like something that would really fly in space. I was rarely bored like this. Even though I read all the bad critics about this flick and I was kinda prepared, it still felt like a very negative experience. Don't get me started about logic and the flow of the story. Like how the man-wolf knows instantly where to find the princess on Jupiter. Well, rant is over, move on.

197,MovieSonic,Fantastic or laughable depending on your mood(/age),7,22 April 2015,"Well I enjoyed it! I read the negative reviews, saw the slightly-under-6 IMDb rating (to date) and almost wrote it off but luckily, I'm a fan of both lead actors (Channing Tatum and Mila Kunis) and I love Sci Fi so I gave it a chance.First off, the Sci Fi element is fantastic. The new technology, gadgets and aliens are brilliant. One species in particular reminded me of the Scarrans in Farscape. I wish they'd had a bigger presence, in the film but also in the film's fictional society as once again, despite Channing's character explaining how arrogant we are for assuming we're the only sentient beings in this vast universe, it appears that humans, with all our limitations, still managed to become the rulers of the universe.The effects and chase sequences, especially one extended chase early on, were outstanding.In terms of dialogue, character development, story progression etc. I'd place the maturity and intellect somewhere along the lines of Divergent (2014), The Hunger Games (2012) and at times, hints of Twilight (2008). This is definitely pure fantasy fodder for young people but like John Carter (2012), there are some genuinely hilarious and insightful moments that pull you back in at times when your post-pubescent brain may be wandering. Bonus: Sean Bean pops up part way through which is always a nice surprise.I thought there could have been better direction because almost everyone mumbles their lines at one point or multiple and Eddie Redmayne basically whispers all the way through.Depending on your mood, the reviews you've read (i.e. your expectations), your age and so on, you will either consider this an entertaining bit of fantasy fluff or, you will cringe at the predictability and resume your game of scrabble.I switched off my brain for a couple of hours and thoroughly enjoyed it so it's 7/10 for me.",Jupiter Ascending
198,J-bot6,"If you like design and sci-fi, watch this film",7,20 September 2015,"It has been awhile since anyone stretched their imaginations in the realm of motion pictures. Jupiter Ascending is a a bit like taking Fifth Element and The Chronicles of Riddick and putting them into a blender combined with the adventure and feel of Treasure Planet. As mentioned in a number of publications, the production design is extraordinary and references the works of industry legends like Syd Mead and Chris Foss. There's no question that the starships and planets featured in this film are expertly rendered and presented. Additional influences include a variety of architectural forms with an aesthetic not unlike that of Warhammer's Battlefleet Gothic.As for the creatures, they're pretty good -- for the most part. The most obvious weakness in effects are the smaller 'big-headed' aliens. Both their surfacing attributes and their motion are unconvincing.The story is a typical archetypal tale. There won't really be many surprises here. This is not a sophisticated tale by any means, nor was I expecting one. Of course, neither was 1977's Star Wars and it has certainly survived the test of time.Additional story elements (galactic bureaucracy and genetic engineering for profit) appear to be pulled from sources like the 2008 publication ""Alien Interview"".The acting is fine. I have no complaints. Editing is good, although some the fighter craft action sequences on Earth were a bit long and video-gamey. A bit of a foreground/background element separation was evident at times, although barely detectable. When the action cut durations slowed down for the later sequences in the film, it seemed to work much better.In many ways, this film strikes me as what the 1980 film ""Flash Gordon"" wanted to be. It's a fun and often humorous space opera with plenty of inspired visuals. If you're expecting something cerebral then look elsewhere. If you want to be entertained and presented with truly massive scale, then this is the film for you.",Jupiter Ascending
199,feakes,Original story marked by high imagination = great movie.,10,19 October 2015,Just to be clear. I loved Jupiter Ascending. Make of that what you will. to me any movie that is original and not like any of the other weekend releases gives it a big jump ahead of its rivals. that is how I look at a movie if its a warmed over rehash of a story told often enough with the clichés intact from the 30's and 40's why bother to see it ? unless its done well.Jupiter Ascending is highly original and has that imagination I'm always looking for.Jupiter Jones is a poor woman. born into a poor Russian family in the city of Chicago. Jupiter makes her living by doing housekeeping for rich people. cleaning the bathrooms and vacuuming the carpets at least gives her enough money for basic needs . When Her cousin has a idea for her to sell her Eggs to a fertility clinic. Jupiter agrees because she needs the money. But once at the clinic something happens that's life changing. a gang of aliens burst in as she is being tested. in a attempt to kill her and she is saved by a another Alien this time he's a former Legionaire doing bounty hunting jobs . His job is to find her and protect her . Why ? Because she is the last in line of the Royal Bloodline that makes her literally the Queen of the universe. And because of this she has enemies who want her dead at all costs.The special Effects take center stage here. as does the story. The actors do a good job keeping up and delivering a solid performance.When people complain about the lack of originality in Hollywood and complain about too many remakes and reboots.

202,kieranbattams,Great Visuals. Messy Plot. Average Movie..,5,15 February 2015,"I want to start by saying that Jupiter Ascending is a film I never actually planned to see, I just sort of turned up to the cinema saw that it was on and took a chance, so my expectations were increasingly low at this point. This particular film is such an average film that i neither liked or disliked it, but there are elements of each here.This is where i usually talk about the plot of the movie, but trying to explain the plot of this one is hard because it was so messy and parts were so sudden or thrown in that I don't know where to begin really. From what i can make out Mila Kunis, who is fine in the movie az Jupiter but nothing more, is a regular girl of earth descent who for some reason is pulled into some sort of battle and named as royalty all because some bees took a liking to her. She is aided by Channing Tatum on this adventure, who I must say was the best part of this movie in terms of acting. Eddie Redmayne is also in this movie, who has been nominated for an Oscar for his portrayal of Stephen Hawking and is currently the frontrunner to win and rightly so. His acting in The Theory of Everything was astonishing but here he just doesn't have anything to work with and is so bland in every way that it made me forget for a second just how good of an actor he really is.There are positives to talk about but in the end these just sort of get forgotten about. Like i said Mila Kunis and especially Channing Tatum are good with what they are given here, even if that isn't much and the visuals are great. The film looks absolutely beautiful but given the fact that the plot is thrown around everywhere i didn't have too much time to enjoy this, and the film is only 2 hours but it dragged on so much! I found myself getting distracted by my own thoughts at times, but when there is an action scene in place i must admit that it was almost always spectacular.In the end im going to say Jupiter Ascending is an okay movie but don't spend your money on it, wait for a rental. And before i leave you with that thought did anybody else find the spliced humans REALLY creepy? In fact the whole relationship between Jupiter and Channing Tatum? Im pretty sure that's beastiality. Anyway, it had potential but ultimately let itself down and doesn't really have anything going for it. But there could be worse ways to waste 2 hours so there's that",Jupiter Ascending
203,dagallop,Second watch...,10,23 June 2019,"I remember watching this while I was on vacation a few years ago, now I really wish I had watched it on the big screen when it was released!The CGI in this movie is by far the best of its time and frankly kicks the stuffing out of the latest Marvel offerings! Ironically, unlike the Marvel offerings this is a brilliant story and regardless of the morons that suggest that this is a; 'mish-mash', I believe it holds up exceptionally well! Think classic family feuding power struggle and add some sci-fi to it and it is a proven story. Yes, they could have filled in some gaps but it would have made it a three hour movie! We all know that long movies that are just regurgitating story parts (Endgame is a classic example of how NOT to over indulge in superfluous story lines) get 'tedious' so live with it!The acting is brilliant, by everyone, even the CGI characters are so good you can start imagining their own stories! And as for Mila Kunis; just wow! She is a tightly packaged power house of an actor that could carry, literally, any role! The next Cleopatra epic MUST have her in the lead and Channing Tatum has to be her Mark Antony!! He is another one of those actors that as well as being more than capable, makes you feel he was the character he is playing his entire life!On a side note, I actually see Sean Bean's character as the only 'weak' part and that is probably because the Wachowski's didn't allow him enough time to develop it! Eddie Redmayne was brilliant as the 'bad guy', he has a natural talent for just appearing menacing and for someone so young, he gave the impression that he was a seasoned 'bad guy'! Douglas Booth did the 'handsome evil prince' bit well and Tuppence Middleton was pretty good as the third leg of the 'oil baron like' family.One comment that I have to make is that the music score is so obviously partially ripped off the Star Trek movie scores! Michael Giacchino probably saved a bit of time in the studio by simply transposing some of the 2009/2013 themes!Synopsis: I really enjoyed this movie, it had a great story (contrary to the downers!) and the CGI was absolutely amazing. The music fitted well but was obviously replicated from the Star Trek franchised themes! The acting is great and it is truly a non-stop action packed sci-fi masterpiece!

204,russellingreviews,A bit of a dog's breakfast (or a sic-fi mess),4,16 February 2015,"""I like dogs"" - Jupiter JonesOverall rating: 2 stars Cinematic rating: 2 stars Family value: 2 starsWalking into the cinema... When will The Matrix stop being the benchmark for the Wachowski siblings careers? There is hope that their innovative brilliance can present itself again. Unfortunately, there is not much hope for Jupiter Ascending, due to the production issues with this film. Regardless of the bad press leading up to the release of this film, can this be the one to pull them out of their decline into directorial mediocrity?Plot Summary Jupiter Jones (Mila Kunis) hates her life. She lives as an illegal alien in Chicago. Born under majestic stars on arrival to the land of promise, Jupiter seemed to be born for a charmed life. The reality of her life seems to be different that he stars proclaimed, a life of cleaning toilets for the rich and envying their lives. Then Caine (Channing Tatum) enters her life, a genetically engineered ex-military hunter, that introduces her to the realities of the universe and her status as a galactic princess. Jupiter is part of a royal heritage that rules the universe and she gets pulled into the family battle of the Abrasax siblings. She must quickly determine where her loyalties reside, with her earthly family or in her broader responsibilities in the universe. Review The poet Robert Browning provided us with the powerful phrase, less is more. A concept that the directors of Jupiter Ascending should have considered. This film is an example of trying to do too much in one film. The Wachowski siblings (The Matrix, Cloud Atlas) seem to be lost in their own world. They do not seem to know what message they are trying convey. Is this meant to be a groundbreaking sci-fi epic, a philosophical discussion on reincarnation and the potential effects it has on the universe, a conscience blow to the atrocities of materialism and misuse of the environment, a Saturday matinée style adventure or a desperate attempt to get their directing careers back on track? Whatever they were attempting to communicate, the message gets lost in the delivery. Andy and Lana have never fully recovered from the success of the The Matrix. Their attempt to find the same cutting edge vision has caused them to lose sight of one essential component of film- making, good story is what should drives film. Eddie Redmayne, Mila Kunis and Sean Bean are left with weak dialogue that caused the audience to laugh at inappropriate times. The poor acting performances cannot be blamed solely on the actors or even on their agents for getting them connected with this film, but on the weak script and convoluted story. The story has whispers of Greek mythology and conveys a sci-fi re-telling of self absorbed creators who manipulate the universe for their own selfish purposes. The Oedipus situation even gets a nod within the storyline, which adds a unnecessary creepiness to experience. The hope for the film was in the special effects. The release delay of this film was attributed to additional work in this area, which are good, but not original or ground breaking. The directors could have taken from George Lucas' lessons and realised that good CGI cannot hide a poorly executed film. It is not good to kick a dog, or in this case, a spliced species, when it is down, but there is not much to praise about this film. The content of the film is relatively benign. It contains a certain level of science fiction violence, but besides one bath scene, the film is surprisingly tame compared with other Wachowski outings. Like most of their film portfolio, there is a heavy reliance on Eastern Mysticism and reincarnation as a story vehicle. This component of the film can lead to considerations of the afterlife and does show that this method of 'rebirth' is a vicious and hopeless view of the afterlife. The potential for good discussion on topics like materialism, the environment and the after-life do present themselves, but due to the muddled script, most of the discussion after the film seemed to be one of pity for the careers of the Wachowskis. Leaving the cinema... 'I like dogs.' Unfortunately, this was one of the best lines in the film. This line did get the biggest laugh in the film. It was an example of the script and that it was a bit of a 'dog's breakfast'. The Wachowskis have the ability to write good story lines, The Matrix was a ground breaking experience, but Jupiter Ascending was a heart breaking experience. Reel Dialogue: What are the bigger questions to consider from this film? 1. What happens after death? (John 11:25, 1 Corinthians 15:51-57) 2. What is our purpose in the universe?

205,nikashvili,Jupiter Ascending is the only movie where Sean Bean should have been dead,4,6 February 2015,"When it comes to creation of cult movies, The Wachowski siblings are among few directors who created something so outstanding that it still defines the genre - I mean The Matrix Trilogy. Then it was Cloud Atlas with rave reviews and my personal favorite. Logically, I expected something very extraordinary, that would blow my mind in any ways their films do. Honestly, the casting of Jupiter Ascending should be giving a clear vision of what would the movie look like. Movie starts with introducing Russian immigrant Jupiter Jones (Mila Kunis) waking up at 4:30 in the morning, rushing to her job which merely includes cleaning toilets of rich people. She's obviously hating her life, because there is nothing happening until some unearthly creatures try to assassinate her at the hospital. Being saved by ex-military member named Caine Wise (Channing Tatum) she learns that one of the members of galaxy's most influential families wants her dead. Balem (Eddie Redmayne) has inherited Earth after his mother's mystical death. His other sibling Titus (Douglas Booth) wants to take over control on our planet, because it is such a treasure. The reason why Jupiter needs to be killed is that she is a reincarnation of Balem's mother and accordingly the sole owner of the planet, meanwhile Titus is trying to save her, marry her and claim the title. For that reason, he sent Caine as a savior. And here starts Miss Jones's voyage through galaxies to meet her ""family"" and prove that she owns the Earth, in order to keep it safe. As visually spectacular Jupiter Ascending is, as messy the story seems. It's two hours of Jupiter's stupid decisions, number of drama scenes between Wise and her, tons of fights and flights. What Wachowskis did here is making a visually stunning motion picture, a bunch of beautiful images and views on cosmos. I appreciate that, I wished Nolan did the same in Interstellar. But visuals can not be everything in the film, because those colorful clouds and stunning planets get boring after an hour and you are left with the most illogical plot ever.Basically, if you've watched Thor and some other similar films, you know every ""plot twist"" in Jupiter Ascending. Everything here is so predictable - you know when the main characters make stupid decisions, when they are saved, when they fall in trouble and the way it ends. Looks like director/writer siblings did not try to think of something new that would genuinely be remembered. Instead, they went with a lot of bla-bla-bla dialogues, naming tons of different names and families, you won't remember in couple of minutes and need not to remember. Characters are ultimate boring and cliché. We have here: a pretty girl who is so important and needs to be saved - that would be Jupiter Jones; a brave soldier who's just doing his job but falls with the main character - Wise; an old military friend who is always there - Stinger (Sean Bean); an evil man with enormous ego - Balem; disobedient sibling - Titus; creatures that convince us that not everyone in the universe look like us - the crocodile things and a lot of soldiers and inter galaxy armies who do nothing at all.The eye candy cast is doing its job - eye candy-ing. Mila Kunis proves that she's a pretty face some guys love to see on the screen and even though she's actually cute, her face or emotions never change. Tatum and Redmayne do their MUSTS - shirtless scenes. I even tweeted that I love Eddie since I saw him in Les Miserable, but he was frighteningly awful in here. He was the most average villain in terms of everything - from facial expressions to voicing and gestures. I expected so much more.There is one moment I really liked - the scene where Jupiter is trying to claim her title and interacts with galactic bureaucracy is hilarious. Even her lawyer, who is a robot, gets irritated and tries to bribe people to make it faster. This is probably the only interesting thing this movie tries to demonstrate. If one wants to praise directors, this would solely be about the universe they created, which suggests not much new, but it is very spectacular with brilliant mixture of colors and stunning production design. For that reason, I am angry. I am angry as a fan of Wachowskis, I am angry as a fan of 4 their biggest films and I am angry as a movie goer. Even if no one claimed it would be a masterpiece, I still expected something genuinely memorable. The only memorable thing about Jupiter Ascending was my disappointment.",Jupiter Ascending

Of course, she doesn't believe all this until aliens attempt to kill her; and later bees don't sting her because they recognize Royalty and, of course, when Stinger (Sean Bean) sees this he addresses her as, ""Your Majesty."" All this sounds good, really good, but the presentation of the entire movie leaves something to be desired. For one thing the CGI battles last way too long starting out with Cane rescuing Jupiter as Aliens try to shoot them down, and sometimes we cannot make out what the bad Aliens are saying. The whole movie is too enamored with CGI battles. While the CGI battles are really good, they go on forever and you know that puts us in La La Land.The only thing that keeps us watching is Jupiter's dialogues as we can understand her all the time. Like us she wants to know what is going on and who are these things that don't look like humans? Eventually, she learns that she is the owner of the Earth (Whaaaat?) and that Balem Abrasax (Eddie Redmayne) the head human-looking Alien needs her in marriage, and then to kill her to become the owner of the Earth to be able to harvest humans to make a some youth potion elixir that is highly prized among other competing Aliens in the Universe. There were a few good scenes when Cain took Jupiter to get her Title authenticated. It reminded us when we deal with our local DMV and, of course, our frustrations. Good stuff. I was thoroughly impressed with Eddie Redmayne's portrayal of Belem, the Head Alien. This Eddie Redmayne is very good. Kudos. All this sounds simple but the CGI and other hand-to-hand battles get in the way for going on too long and I mean too long. Of course some sub plots involving Cane and Stinger (Sean Bean) also get in the way, but we can put up with them.However, the CGI set designs for the movie are simply spectacular and do make for unbelievably good cinematography. Kudos. Should be an Oscar in there somewhere.Hard to believe, but the CGI brought this down. We like CGI, but we want to see more of the story.

Its promise of an engaging story soars at the start, but from the heights it reached within its complex and ever expanding universe, it descends rapidly and falls flat with its poor and brow-arching narrative. The film's biggest mistake is that it focuses heavily on decorating its worlds and everything in them, that it leaves its script poorly delivered and blandly executed. Its story, following an ordinary woman deemed to be ""the Chosen One"", rolls and branches out from one world to another now and then, but often gets derailed from its spine, and thus gets left unresolved. It gets further dragged by uninteresting and underdeveloped characters you would rather laugh about and love if they weren't in the scene.JUPITER ASCENDING fails to carry out a glorious astral ascent. In spite of its jaw-dropping visual prestige, it misfires and never soars past its cinematographic grandeur.

Don't get me wrong, there was a lot of terrible stuff about it, but I think the movie did an interesting thing with the character of Jupiter.You see, this is a chosen one story with June as the chosen one. Usually in these stories, the chosen one turns out to be really special and have really special powers that they learn to master in a short time and save the world because they are so special. This wasn't the case with June. She was unremarkable at the start. She remains unremarkable through the story. She's unremarkable by the end. It really sounds like I'm making fun of her, but I'm really not. June is a nice girl with a decent heart. But she suffers from some self esteem issues, and she isn't the smartest. She also lacks the physicality to be the action star of this action movie. So she just stumbles through the plot, never magically overcoming her shortcomings, but trying to do the best she can given her limitations. Others around her do the rescuing. June is incredibly lucky. The tension in her story revolves around some ethical decisions she has to make. And well, that was refreshingly different enough to not make this a terrible movie in my opinion.",Jupiter Ascending

This was a mess worse than Matrix Reloaded and I'm pretty sure at this point Wachowski's have forgotten how to make a movie without throwing in CGI at every corner.CGI was EVERYWHERE and so overdone that you just stop caring about anything happening because it all looks fake. The combat is done mostly with CGI characters with SFX thrown everywhere on-screen, so get ready to spend time trying to figure out WTF is actually going on. I like how they had to mask CGI characters by throwing in blurry camera-work and motion blur in every scene. Most scenes in-fact, look like a video game capture with mindless shooting and explosions. Most of the alien world is CGI, which would be OK except in this movie, the worlds are some of THE most generic alien worlds ever. I've seen artists create better concept art for alien worlds on DeviantArt than this movie. Every alien world is mixed with same post-processing paint-job making them look almost similar (yellow, after Matrix's green and blue, Wachowski's favorite color for sci-fi is yellow now).Forget CGI, the plot and characters are a bigger mess. Mila Kunis is probably THE worst choice for her role.. actually no, Tatum was THE worst choice for HIS role (tbh I was more busy laughing at his pink lipstick). No idea why Sean Bean is even there, he's way too better for this crap-fest. To make it worse, most of the dialogue is blended in with loud music. Apparently Wachowski brothers still don't know how to balance sound in their movies. Alien words and worlds thrown in, while everything else is so.. human. Nothing alien about these people.The laughably bad CGI aliens or costumes for aliens were worse than newer Star Wars movie where everything looks fake.What a mess, I can't even be arsed to go into detail with the review, it was THAT bad.",Jupiter Ascending

The characters are utterly one dimensional and straight out of the ""my big book of film characters"" that we have seen millions of times before. Ham acting then adds to the failure. All over the top and not credible. Next the action comprises of one sequence after another that should kill or maim yet the heroine acquires barely a scratch. Utterly unbelievable and generates no tension whatsoever. The CGI is all pervasive and looks like CGI. It does it's best to provide the animation the script is calling for which is not a compliment. CGI is a great piece of icing for a decent cake. Ultimately though CGI is not substantial enough to provide a feast for the eyes on it's own. CGI is best when it's not noticed. Here it could not be more noticeable if it tried. All this adds up to giving the viewer the feeling of watching a cartoon aimed at kids.The plot itself is fine but it's poorly realised. Our heroine is passed from one baddie to the next and generates confusion. Given the simplicity of the plot such confusion can not have been generated easily.All in this film is a mess. Some films you watch and you just know you'll see them again at some point. After watching this it's now firmly on my list of films to ignore.

Aiming to be ambitious, it seems to be the prequel of the fifth story of Cloud Atlas, combining the elements of reincarnation, breeding, creating new lives as motive source and harvesting with their usual cinematography styles, but it turns out to be a bit complex for squeezing these daring ideas into a rushing two hours in which a number of unnecessarily silly parts should have been replaced to develop the whole universe in details. It has the nostalgic moments thanks to the amazing reconstruction of certain Cloud Atlas scores by Michael Giacchino, the performances from the cast however is a bit mixed - nothing surprise from Tatum and Kunis thanks to the cheesy dialogues, but Eddie Redmayne as the main antagonist role looks promising though with limited screen time.

219,SteveMierzejewski,A Triumph of Form over Substance,5,22 February 2015,"First of all, if you are expecting to see something along the lines of the first Matrix film, forget it. Consider this more like Matrix 4. The first Matrix film was heavy on new ideas, but, as the series developed, it became more Hollywood: Lots of action, more special effects, and a basic story line. This is how I saw Jupiter Ascending.At the beginning, the film held some promise. I liked the absurdity of Jupiter Jones (give me a break), played by Mila Kunis, discovering that she played a key role in the history of the universe. This held promise as did Channing Tatum's deadpan character, Caine Wise (yeah, I know). There were also some intriguing scientific ideas that I thought would be explored and that could lead to some interesting conclusions. Unfortunately, the movie deteriorated into a series of action scenes rife with special effects designed for the 3D viewer. I saw the movie in 2D but, as anyone who's seen 3D movies knows, certain special effects work best in 3D (things flying at the camera). In fact, you start wondering if the movie wasn't made around the 3D effects.The story is more or less predictable. I found it difficult to accept the love story aspect as believable. The only excuse Jupiter gives for her interest in Caine is that he's not good, I'm not sure if she was commenting on his acting or not. The acting is sub-par by all involved. The number of times Jupiter is saved from death at the last second by Caine is laughable.So, basically, what you are left with are a string of loosely connected special effects, which, to be honest, are mainly good. I saw the movie with my 12-year-old son and he liked them as well as the numerous fight scenes. I have a feeling if I asked him about the plot, he could only give me a basic idea.Maybe we're expecting too much from the Wachowskis. It's beginning to look as if the Matrix was a one-off. Maybe the temptation of making a Hollywood blockbuster is just too strong to resist.

It does not have a lot of character development but it makes up for that with dizzying special effects and non-stop action (I recommend seeing it in 3D). They also manage to create an incredible universe that should be a good location for future sequels and even a series spin-off! I especially enjoyed a slight detour into the bowels of a Steam/Cyber Punk bureaucracy - very well observed and funny. The, despite some criticisms, was very entertaining and satisfying. I've read many of the negative reviews and agree that the characters are paper thin personalities, but I think the humor (the Russian family) and special effects lift it above it's current 6.0 IMDb score.

Action sequences were much to fast and blurry to see what was going on, wasting much of the CGI and other effects... would have been better to slow some of it down to punctuate the action and give the audience time to appreciate what was happening. Plot was basically a SciFi revamp of Cinderella with more action and special effects, except our ""Cinders"" is a moron with the self-preservation instincts of a Lemming. She is first conned into marrying one villain and isn't capable of seeing more than two minutes into the future of that union when she would have been killed, only to be rescued by the hero before that happens. Then Jupiter goes blindly into the lair of the main villain to who she is willing to sign over her own, her family's and the Earths only protection provided he doesn't kill her family in front of her. At this point I stopped watching (after 80 minutes) as the logic of the plot was just too weak.

225,fullheadofsteam,"For Those Who ""Don't Get the Hate' (as in criticism of the movie)",2,11 August 2015,"A discussion thread has been created among those who don't get the hate thrown at this movie. Well, if you read the negative reviews, it's simply not that hard to understand. First and foremost, it's not hatred so much as film criticism, and the bigger the budget spent on making a movie, the more important it is for the movie to be a polished and good piece. This movie ain't ""it"". So let's break it down point-by-point! The story line is terribly flawed. Watch the film, then please coherently explain the exact purpose and actions of the ruling siblings' sister. Can't intelligently be done. Next, try to logically explain how Channing Tatum's character can be torpedoed into outer dark space to die, yet somehow he manages to intercept a floating portable space suit. And please don't forget the home invasion and abduction of Mila's entire family, which unexplainably none of them can later remember. And Sean Bean's reason for betrayal? As unoriginal and thereby rendered stupid as it could be. Plot fails like these abound. Next, let's look at acting. Mila Kunis can't act, or at least didn't in this film. And Channing Tatum is, as elsewhere reviewed, wooden and one-dimensional. There is no chemistry between them. One of the best actors in the film, Eddie Redmayne, delivers most of his lines under his breath, so you'd better have subtitles on the screen to understand what he says. So, let's next say that we want to have a fun amusement park ride with this film, well not to be redundant, but Tatum's shoe-flying sequences can only be thrilling to someone under the age of 6 years old. They are neither sophisticated or believable CG. Then, as also said elsewhere, much of the CG action sequences are deliriously fumbled-up-mumbled- up messes which cannot be followed by even a trained movie-eye -- if someone tells you that they followed all of those sequences, they may be either lying or thriving on mind- altering substances (which, by the way, may not be a bad way to go with this movie!). So, of course, the film elements already mentioned -- plot, acting, effects -- all are part of the bigger element, which is direction. Given that these directors were once responsible for one of the finest and best Sci-Fi pictures of all times (The Matrix trilogy), this movie deserves criticism because we know that the Wachowski's can do perfect! And I am one of those in the minority who also liked Speed Racer. So there you have it - - why the hate. If you insist on not getting it, then live and let live and go on enjoying this movie.

However, Jupiter is shocked when she learns how the human population of the Earth fits into the broader scheme of things.In many ways, this film feels like ""Dune"" meets ""Cinderella."" Like the 1984 film, ""Dune;"" this movie is very otherworldly and is occasionally a bit disorienting. Some members of the audience will probably find themselves experiencing alien culture shock. Following aspects of the story sometimes requires an unusual amount of concentration on the part of the viewer. Like ""the Matrix,"" this film often feels a bit surreal as well.The film is visually stunning. It does an excellent job of creating the look and feel of an alien world. However, the viewer never gets to know the members of Jupiter Jones' family very well. The backstory about Jupiter Jones' father seems a bit rushed; and the explanation behind Jupiter's given name seems a bit forced. In the role of Jupiter Jones, Mila Kunis plays the part of a fish-out-of-water quite well in the face of an alien world, filled with politics and intrigue. However, Kunis' character of Jupiter Jones does seem to adapt to her unusual circumstances rather quickly.This film is often complicated.

I think the Wachowskis could have run the script through at least one proofread by a competent editor (though George Lucas did no better with Star Wars, which had equally atrocious screen writing and dialogue). However, it IS the best special effects ever in a scifi film, and Jupiter's red spot has never been done better (q.v., 2010: A Space Odyssey for a long-ago contrast). When I was a kid I loved Flash Gordon at the theatre on Saturday mornings. This was no less enjoyable at that level.

Its like Star Wars meets Guardians of the Galaxy with a dash of Romeo and Juliet. But the movie falls on its face as its neither funny or serious. Eddie Redmayne is the most annoying character, badly acted I might add. There are the obligatory car crashes and blow ups and of course you know there are cars that magically flip over again and again. So its really overdone and used. Overall its sci-fi garbage and will probably do down in history as a dud along with the new Tron and other flops. You will like the lead characters, and the acting is decent (not great) but the story just seems to have too many holes in it and never develops until near the end. This would be a great movie for college students interesting in movie making as it is the perfect movie to show them what to avoid and what is missing in a real movie with a real story.",Jupiter Ascending
233,sashamyshkina,Receives way too much hate - a glorious piece of sci-fi eye candy.,9,14 October 2020,"I don't understand what everyone has against this movie. It's really not as bad as everyone says it is. In fact, it's one of my favourite films, and I just don't get the bad reviews. And, yes, it's not a masterpiece, and I do like it primarily in a bit of a ""so-bad-it's-good"" way, but that doesn't change a lot of my opinions.This is my first IMDb review so I think I should start with a movie I have heard some very controversial opinions on, and buckle up, because I have a lot to say.Let me just say I liked this movie. You heard me. I. liked. It. I think that this is a great attempt at creating an original story that's not an adaptation or a sequel, and I think that the storyline is rich and interesting. The effects are simply stunning, and it has to be one of the most visually rich films I've seen (think: cathedral spaceships). It's just so loaded with elaborately planned content and history - I have seen this film nine times and every time I watch it again I find yet more things which I didn't notice before. I enjoyed the plot, I don't think I've seen anything similar to this movie. I mean, whenever people ask me to sum it up, I can never quite do so. The action sequences are beautifully choreographed in the style of the Wachowskis.The whole thing was just a surreal, beautiful, elaborate, weird space opera adventure. It's honestly so over-the-top and crazy that I don't think you were ever meant to take it seriously - I mean, I've got to admit I have burst out laughing watching this even when the dialogue wasn't supposed to be inherently funny (for example, when the actors try to explain completely nonsensical stuff like flying boots or gene splicing with a perfectly straight face, or the fact that all of the protagonists are American whilst all three antagonists are just so British). The script is pretty bad at times, but honestly sometimes that's what makes it just so enjoyable. But that's the thing I love the most about this film.I really want this to get a sequel. I mean, I know that will never happen due to the box-office failure of this, but the storyline has so, so much potential - not all of the loose ends were tied up and there's so much world building that could happen just because of how rich the Jupiter Ascending universe is.I mean, you can definitely see the years of sci-fi classics that have left their imprint Jupiter Ascending. The plot reminded me an uncanny amount of Dune (there's a life-prolonging substance which is very hard to obtain, and person born into royalty has to save the world from their over-the-top royal relatives) with a bit of the Matrix (people are harvested as sustenance for higher life-forms). When I finished reading and watching Dune, my first immediate thought was ""This is literally the same thing as Jupiter Ascending"". But despite these similarities, Jupiter Ascending manages to keep its originality and unique taste without being seen as a rip-off.'Jupiter Ascending' has got to be the most hated-on film that I know. And that really makes me annoyed because I love this film and, whilst I respect peoples' opinions and some of the things they say are true, I genuinely don't understand all the criticisms. To name a few, people are constantly talking about the 'overly complex plot line' and the 'underdeveloped characters'. Okay, fine, the plot is a bit hard to follow at times and it does jump around a little, but I love the fact that this is a very thought-out plot. There's a very cohesive history behind the film. In addition, it's a great metaphor for capitalism and the fight for resources. The music is incredible and so, so perfect for suspense, as well as giving the film such unique and recognisable themes (I still have the music from the trailer stuck in my head!).I disagree with the repeated claims that the characters are underdeveloped. First of all, this film has about five or six main characters, and it is HARD to give each a perfectly realised backstory, motivations, a personality etc. In the space of two hours. If you want incredibly deep characters, please go watch a soap opera or a romance movie or something. Here, in that space of two hours, you get a very interesting look at the characters. Each has their own motivation and ideas. I mean, you have Jupiter and Caine's relationship, the Abrasax rivalry, and Jupiter's bond with her slightly chaotic Earth family. Jupiter Ascending has a very interesting and varied cast with a lot of famous names in it (as well as some people who I have never heard of but definitely seem worth checking out, like Tuppence Middleton who I would definitely like to see more of). Mila Kunis and Channing Tatum perform well as the leads of the story and they have interesting chemistry on screen, but I think that the strongest performance came from Eddie Redmayne as the primary antagonist. Remember how I said that this film is over-the-top? Well, I'm just going to say that his performance *redefines* 'over-the-top'.I'm not saying that this film is a masterpiece. It's not. The pacing is far from perfect, with some of the action sequences being a way too long and there being some stretches where nothing really happens, and the storyline can be a bit hard to follow as I have already mentioned. The script, at times, is pretty terrible, and not even all of the beautiful, gorgeous CGI cannot distract from times when the story drags. The storyline, albeit having so much potential and alleyways that it can spiral down into, wasn't exactly very well executed, which is disappointing because it really was such a great idea that was weighed down with slightly questionable execution.Despite all of these problems, I still really enjoyed this film, and all confusion goes away with a rewatch or a quick read of the Wikipedia page or a second watch. I must say that this movie is not for everyone, as it is more of the fantasy side of science fiction as oppose to something like the Matrix which is more of a thriller/ traditional action sci-fi. Because of this, can I please just mention that people have got to stop comparing this to the Matrix? It's not the Matrix. That came out 20 years ago. This is a completely different style of film, and it is completely illogical to compare the two.Jupiter Ascending will remain one of my favourite movies, and I firmly believe it is a must-watch for any science fiction fan. Yeah, it's ridiculous, but that's why it's so great. Do not listen to all of the ""this is the worst movie ever"". They don't know what they're talking about. We need more films like Jupiter Ascending.-Sasha.",Jupiter Ascending
234,Tron79,Mila Kunis was wasted with ridiculousness,1,20 November 2018,"I actually just watched this movie again after forgetting how bad it was the first time I saw it a couple years ago. The trailer is really great and I love watching Mila Kunis, so I got hooked into watching this film again! I won't be pulled in a third time. I thought the initial premise was interesting, and I was definitely interested in following Mila on her journey. But things quickly turned into the ridiculous territory as one fight scene blended into another ridiculous fight scene. This movie reminded me of the endless fight scenes in the Transformer movies where Transformers just kept crashing into each other. The over the top music was just loud and extremely annoying. Whenever Mila had a quiet scene, I was drawn in again. She had a couple of funny lines here and there that helped keep me awake a little longer. Don't get drawn in by the trailer. I recommend people skip this one. (I just watched the trailer again. It had Sean Bean in it from Game of Thrones that drew me in even more. It's a great trailer!

I couldn't even watch the whole movie, after one half way through I just fast forwarded to towards the end.

As it turned out, I was pleasantly surprised.I can't believe that the reviewers who panned this movie actually watched the same film - maybe they were in some sort of alternate universe.The plot was predictable, but that's probably true of most action movies. The acting was credible, and the visuals were absolutely stunning.My partner and I were afraid that too much of the film would take place on earth, rather than in space, but that too, turned out not to be the case.My recommendation: go see the film, but leave your preconceived notions at home - where they belong.",Jupiter Ascending

238,tgrock,"Disappointing, but for the Opposite Reasons as Everyone Else (Mostly)",6,3 May 2015,"Jupiter Ascending has the following positives:1) Pretty good story.2) Some impressive visuals (sometimes). There is an amazing battle (not because of the battle) that goes all around Chicago. I have no idea how they filmed it. I was in awe of the camera-work. 3) Some good dialogue.4) Some good characters.Here are the cons:1) Action Sequences: You know how in the Star Wars prequels, the least interesting parts of the film were the space battles because they were all CGI. Here, the same rule applies. Every action scene has WAY too much CGI (and sometimes pathetic CGI) to the point that they are not interesting at all. Secondly, there are way too many action scenes. Had there been 1-3 action scenes, it would have made the film a little more enjoyable. Yet, there are maybe 10 actions scenes in this movie. Just like in a martial arts film like Ong Bak, the action scenes are of diminishing returns as the film goes on.2) Some Weird Aliens: Like the Star Wars prequels, this film also has ridiculous (and bad looking) CGI alien creatures that to me just made me want to skip each scene that had them. Also, they were generic characters too. It is understandable that when doing a sci-fi film, there will be some world-building elements of some other films. Yet, copying off of the Star Wars prequels is not a very good choice here. You literally have a Naboo rip-off and a Mustafar rip- off too as planets.Summary:Had the film featured less action scenes, I would have enjoyed the film much more. The most enjoyable parts to the film were where characters just spoke dialogue. I had no interest in anything else.This is definitely a skip. Unlike The Wachowski's previous 4 films, I do not think there is much of a chance that you will like this film. Speed Racer was panned and Cloud Atlas got extremely bipolar reviews. Yet, both have fans who love them (including myself). I do not think this will be a cult-film unless there is maybe a director's cut that adds more drama scenes to it and cuts out some of the action sequences.",Jupiter Ascending
239,epalejandrocarrillo,Essence of gelfling.,4,9 August 2020,The focus of the story is all over the place. The first big action is rendered pointless because the aliens that are trying to kill Jupiter fix the city. Apparently even aliens beleve in reincarnation and the bureaucracy in having to re register when they come back. Jupiter reads the intergalactic monopoly rule book and is trying to play the game. Jupiters space family is just as bad as her earth family. Jupiter loves dogs. The stupid end. The music and visual effects are waisted on this story.,Jupiter Ascending
240,Allen_The-Shep_Shepherd,Jupiter Ascending Review,4,4 February 2015,"I know I put the warning at the top but I am going to say it again in more certain terms. I will probably be spoiling things about the movie in my review below.I went into this movie looking for something that would be entertaining and occupy my mind for the 2 hours and 7 minutes that this movie runs. Sadly that did not happen. I know we are in that January to April time frame where most of the movies we are going to see are not going to be great but if we are lucky we might get OK to good movies.One of the major fails for me is the story, we are told at the beginning of how Jupiter Jones's (Mila Kunis) parents meet and all the time you are wondering which one of them is going to be the alien that passes on the royal genes to Jupiter but we come to find out that none of that matters because none of her parents are really aliens and that the reason that she is considered some royal alien is that some sort of genetic hocuspocus has happened and she is the reincarnated Matron Abrasax. Who along with her three kids run a very large processing company that supplies the Universe with product that helps them maintain their youth.So in another miracle the Abrasax family have monitors on all the planets that they administer so that way if this genetic reincarnation does happen they can find it. And of course since they are all money grabbing power hunger people instead of embracing the newly found reincarnated royal they instead try to kill her or manipulate her. And Jupiter keeps falling for this every time she meets another Abrasax. I guess Jupiter didn't remember the saying ""Fool me once shame on you, Fool me twice shame on me..."".Then we get Caine (Channing Tatum) this legendary Legionaire Hunter that got kicked out for murdering an Entitled. We are never told why he committed this act all we are given is that since he is a splice between human and wolf that it was in his nature. So we get a really lame excuse that really has no bearing on the on going story whatsoever. But he is a legendary fighter armed with gravity boots and a energy shield he takes on all comers and only every gets a scratch. I mean some of the fight scenes were good and well choreographed but Caine seriously is one unstoppable force which just becomes so over the top you are watching the screen going ""come on, really?!"". It does give the girls some eye candy though until later this year when the ladies will get Magic Mike XXL.And then poor poor Eddie Redmayne who plays Balem Abrasax. After coming off The Theory of Everything and then seeing him in this generic bad guy role you are like really Eddie? How did they get you into this role. And yes I realize with the delay of this movie he shot this movie before the other one. But Balem speaks in so soft a voice for most of the movie that if you are not paying close attention you will miss some of the things he says. And really all we get are these one dimensional characters that really have no depth to them, Balem is all about the money, Titus (Douglas Booth) is all about enjoying the pleasures in life and Kalique Abrasax (Tuppence Middleton) is all about staying young.In the end Jupiter doesn't really change anything. Two out of three of the Abrasax siblings are still out there running the planets the way they were running Earth prepping them for use. As well as the other Families they tell us are out there doing the same thing. The only thing Jupiter does is save Earth but pretty much says screw the rest of the Universe they are on their own.I will admit the cinematography is really great and have some great open and beautiful scenes. And the biggest spoiler of all is that Sean Bean survives the whole movie!My Recommendation:Rent it.",Jupiter Ascending

242,InMyHonestOpinion,Star Wars meets Guardians of the Galaxy and Game of Thrones mash them together and this is what you will get.,4,25 February 2015,"I sometimes wonder if the hype that surrounds a film is what does it the most damage especially in its first few weeks of release. Then I also wonder is there so much hype being made because the fear of failure lingers so they believe the more they say in a positive the better the reception of the film will be. Having such big names as The Wachowskis well known for their ""Matrix"" trilogy and one of my personal all-time favourite films ""Cloud Atlas"" writing and directing a film can only be a beautiful thing, you would think anywayJupiter Jones begins to tell us in narrative the way her parents first met and his unfortunate death while her mother was carrying her, these days Jupiter is the single, still living with her mother and other relatives, no love for life, feeling worthless cleaner for the rich who has no real aspirations in life other than being aware she was always meant for more. In another part of the Universe the siblings of the most powerful family in the Universe House of Abrasax; Balem, Kalique and Titus fight over their Matriarch's inheritance. On Earth Jupiter has agreed to sell her eggs and give more than half the money to her cousin, whilst in the operating room Jupiter is attacked by keepers (alien hunters) who have been sent by Balem to kill her. Caine an alien tracker Lycian who is half human and half canine has been hired by Titus and ends up saving Jupiter form the keepers. He agrees to help Jupiter which goes against his orders set out by Titus eventually taking her to the capital city of the Universe where Jupiter learns the truth as to why she is so important and why she is wanted dead What a film was my initial thought once the credits at the end of the film started to roll, I still had hundreds of unanswered questions which I found quite frustrating, the film remain on my mind for the next few days as I came up with ideas and answers all it would turn out, worthless. So in saying that I wasn't thinking of this film in a positive light in fact I was extremely disappointed with so much but first here's what I loved. The imagination of this film is insane, the worlds created, the alien races brought to life, the sheer scale of the landscapes and cities everything was amazing. The cities designed each with their own theme was overwhelming to say the least I was amazed by the creativity that was unleashed unfortunately that was where it ended. Everything else was below par in every possible way, the characters were so passé they were never entertaining, never had anything fun to say, it seemed Jupiter was more in the film for comic relief (poorly executed I must say). The script was poor, the story was so confusing and absolutely full of very obvious plot holes it actually got annoying, if there was a lull moment in the film your mind began to wonder as did the fellow cinema goers as you heard fidgeting and readjusting going on all around during the slower moments. The action sequences are what annoyed me most though, the camera work was pathetic, I have no idea why directors continue to use hand held fast moving cameras during action sequences yet they do. Seeing a blur of mess on the screen as two alien spacecraft destroy Chicago is a joke, you are more than aware of what is happening but for some reason the directors have decided we really don't need to see it. So annoying! The score is nice but again nothing too spectacular it definitely has its moments but if you have seen another film from the 70's you will hear something very familiar.Jupiter Ascending stars Mila Kunis (Black Swan, Family Guy) as Jupiter Jones, Channing Tatum (21 Jump Street, Magic Mike) as Caine Wise, Sean Bean (Lord of the Rings, Game of Thrones) Stinger Apini, Eddie Redmayne (The Theory of Everything, Les Miserables) as Balem Abrasax, Tuppence Middleton (The Imitation Game, Trance) as Kalique Abrasax and Douglas Booth (Noah, The Riot Club) as Titus Abrasax. Personally I feel the wrong cast was chosen no-one in the film did anything for me, no one moved me or made me love them, in fact I'd go as far as saying they were all boring including Mila Kunis who I absolute adore usually. This film missed the mark in so many places it was totally disappointing especially since finding out all the stunts were actually performed by the actors; if only we could actually see them!!! It would have made a world of difference I'm sure.I loved the idea behind the film and I would actually love to have seen this film be as good as it promised it would be, I'm sad to say it's not. It is entertaining enough to keep you captivated, you will definitely laugh and I have no doubt you will love the worlds and the idea of how they exist, so I'm not saying skip this film altogether I think more I want you to be prepared to be disappointed, so that when you do see it, your expectations will be so low that you will love what you see instead and wonder why I decided to ingest downers before heading to my seat. One last thing I would recommend though is to forget seeing this at the cinema, with so much happening on the screens at once the big screens made it so hard to follow, wait for the DVD and see it at home in the comfort of your home where you can see everything. It is family friendly not that the kids will understand what is going on, so be prepared for a few possibly unanswerable questions after.",Jupiter Ascending

245,varnium,Not Yet a Masterpiece,7,16 February 2015,"Storyline: Coherence (7): Every element of the story seemed to be quite intact, although there's some part of the story that are not smoothly transitioned. It leaves you a question of ""how did it got there?"". The cause-and-effect component is moderately established.Reasoning (5): Most of the things are reasonable in ""its own universe"". But there are many moments that make you wonder about the consistency of the reasoning of this movie. Why didn't the Aegian battleship attack and remove the warhammers, instead of letting 2 small fighters engage by themselves? If the Jupiter's storm is so violent and the Aegian battleship cannot survive, although it has more advance protection, then how did a small fighter with less protective system able to penetrate the storm better? And the most irrational thing about this movie is knowing that as ruler of the universe that have lived thousands of years, they don't really have a powerful technology as viewers might expect them to. For example, it's just odd on how a simple small ship can penetrate a massive warship owned by the prince of the universe? Isn't it supposed to have maximum protection and make it invincible? Predictability (4): Yes, the story is very predictable. A nobody turns out to be a special person. A handsome guy comes to the rescue. The girl and the guy fall in love. So lame! Characters: Personality (6): Jupiter's personality is not really good. Either the actor cannot live up to the character or she got a really bad script. The heroic guy, on the other hand, also has lack of character. He just seemed cold, but like being forced to be cold. It doesn't dissolve within his interaction with other characters. His commander also lacks the personality. But the personality of the main villains are well established. Maybe it's the lack of story telling that inhibit them to really show their acting quality.Conversation (7): Seems quite okay.

246,dreamdemon-1,An incoherent mess,1,11 February 2015,"""An incoherent mess"" is a mild way to describe the awful motion picture I had the misfortune to see. While I found the special effects and most action scenes used effectively (and particularly nice in IMAX 3D), it fails across the board in terms of acting, story and music.The top failure is the story as presented in the film. While I am sure than the Wachowskis thought out a detailed universe, the movie appears as an uncoordinated mess which jumps from A to B with no apparent connection between the two. There is literally no reason presented for more than half of the plot items used in the movie, appearing as a string of ""deus ex machina"" elements (in particular the mandatory love story which appears out of nowhere at it's so forced on the audience that it made me physically sick).The acting is flat. Mila fails to render any emotion whatsoever, a baffling feat given her proved talents but in the context of the movie, with a script that gives her no chance whatsoever, it starts to make sense. I see no reason why a talent like Mila was paired with your everyday cheap action hero Channing Tatum. They have no chemistry, he has no talent and both their characters are squeezed into a romance so unnatural that the first ""hints"" come from other characters explicitly saying the two have the hots for each other.Bad guy Douglas Booth was charged with providing the mild attempt at providing something unexpected, a titanic task given the flat and utterly predictable (bed time?) story. To his credit, he does play the playboy decently to the degree that the ridiculous writing allowed and overall he seems to have made the best of a bad situation.The other bad boy, Eddie Redmayne, is brought to memory by better roles (Hawking in ""The theory of everything"" and Jack in ""The pillars of the Earth""). His appearance is more baffling than Mila's given the absolute ridiculousness of his character that is not only cardboard flat, but he is neither the ""action-movie"" bad guy that takes on the opposing action hero, but rather ends up fighting a girl hand-to-hand, a battle we know he's gonna lose from the beginning of the movie, despite the fact that Mila's only combat training comes from wielding toilet brushes.The music shows that the movie takes itself way too seriously for a flat action movie (the comic relief moments hardly have any comedy in them) as the score tries to enhance a non-existing drama.The Wachowski's seems to have gone out of their way to ensure it is utterly impossible to feel or root for any of the characters (good or bad). Believe it or not, that's saying something on my part as I tend to invest something even in apparently nonsensical movies such as Schwarzenegger action types.This movie deserves to bomb and teach actors like Mila and Redmayne that it's not worth tarnishing a reputation for money.",Jupiter Ascending

249,anthonymora2,Major Movie Review: Jupiter Ascending,5,6 February 2015,"Jupiter Ascending, was my first big anticipated movie to come out this year and for good reason! Like I said, the Wachowskis are responsible for one of my favorite movies of all time in The Matrix and even their more recent movies, Cloud Atlas and even Speed Racer, were movies that I enjoyed, I even own the 2 on Blu-ray. I've also become quite the Channing Tatum supporter over the past few years and with starring roles in blockbusters like Jupiter Ascending and garnering award worthy praise for his performance in 2015 Best Picture nominee Foxcatcher, it seems like the man knows what he's doing. I was genuinely excited for this movie to come out, however this movie fell victim to delays in its release which is always a cause for alarm. But hey, this is the Wachowskis we're talking about! Maybe they needed more time to perfect their mind blowing epic story and perhaps give us movie buffs another classic. Well, I can tell you one thing for certain and that's that the visual effects artists did everything they can to make this one of the most visually appealing films of the year!I saw this movie in 3D. I'm a guy that can really enjoy watching an entire movie in 3D, so I can really tell when a movie's 3D is worth the extra dollars at the theater and folks, this is some of the best use of 3D that I've seen since Big Hero 6. The special effects were superb and the action scenes were breathtaking, there is this chase scene in the first half hour that has Channing Tatum and Mila Kunis flying through downtown Chicago with all sorts of destruction that melted my face off and that's gotta be my favorite thing about this movie. The Wachowskis have always made some very visually appealing looking action films, there's no doubt there, and what I loved in Jupiter Ascending was how well directed these action scenes were. Oh and on a side note, Channing Tatum's character rocks THE coolest movie shoes ever!Now while I did have a fun time watching the effects and seeing Channing Tatum crush little Grey men with his shield that looked the ones the Gungans used in Phantom Menace, this was a horribly underwhelming story that I thought almost killed this movie entirely. It's weird because the story of Jupiter Ascending, which has Mila Kunis' character discover her intergalactic royalty, is just like in The Matrix, except with Neo becoming ""The One"", so you'd think that the Wachowskis should be capable of creating this immerse movie world with a hugely epic story. But what I didn't like was how average the film's plot actually played out, with it's abundance of boring character conversations involving land ownership, I actually noticed myself getting impatient waiting for any and all dialog scenes to end and for the next action scene to come on. The dialog was almost cringe worthy to hear, especially whenever the forced romance came into play. I don't see why they had to turn to the Hollywood cliché of having a romance between the main characters, I think the story would have benefited from having Tatum's Caine just be a solo bad ass and have Jupiter completely focus on her newly discovered royalty.The only character to care about here I thought was Tatum's character. You learn how he's a modified hunter that has had his genes spliced with that of a wolf which leads to this guy growling like a wolf which made me laugh but, in a weird way, made him even more of an awesome character, as if all his awesome weapons and gadgets don't do that already. The always mighty, Sean Bean plays space hunter and acquaintance to Cain, Stinger and I really liked the back and forth that those two characters shared. It's just a damn shame that there isn't enough of their shared screen time together in the whole movie.Of course, a staple of any great sci-fi epic is to have an intimidating villain that you want to get taken down by the end and while I couldn't wait for this movie's villain to get his, I gotta say that Eddie Redmayne COMPLETELY misses the mark here. I could not contain my laughter every time this man spoke, I swear he sounded like Dumbledore from the first 2 Harry Potter movies! But other than Redmayne's surprisingly weak performance, his character didn't come off as a true threat at all, just incredibly whiny.There's a lot of things that didn't work for Jupiter Ascending and kept if from being another Wachowski classic. Mila Kunis could have made for a capable lead, but unfortunately she was just this chick that kept getting separated from Tatum, only for him to burst in like the Kool-Aid Man to the rescue her, it kind of reminded me of classic Mario. In the end though, as much as I wanted to adore this movie, I was pretty disappointed with the finished product. I haven't lost my faith in the Wachowskis but this is one that could have been something special.Jupiter Ascending, gets 5/10!What about you guys?

250,BeccaGudd,I fell asleep,4,25 February 2017,"The only reason I watched this film was because I'm a big fan of Channing Tatum. Well this was one of his worst performances ever. Channing Tatum wearing eyeliner, he looked like a bad Derek Zoolander! Mila Kumis is also one of my favorite actresses but in this film she lacked character and like in most of her films she is always serious and always has the same facial expressions. The whole story was silly and I fell asleep. Too much over dramatic music and of course Tatum always being a hero. Really disappointed in this film!",Jupiter Ascending
251,FloodClearwater,"Wachowski, Kunis Take Sci-Fi by the (Wolf) Ears",6,24 August 2015,"An Andy Wachowski film starring Mila Kunis, Channing Tatum, and Sean Bean should have serious action flick potential, but in Jupiter Ascending, Mr. Matrix fails to deliver anything resembling a blockbuster. What he creates is a low-to-middling-interest but ultimately streamable sci-fi action film. The best role and best performance trophies go to Mila Kunis. She is believable and magnetic as ""Jupiter,"" a semi-orphaned girl smart enough to do astronomy and tough enough to clean houses all day with her immigrant family. Sean Bean is good as an old war buddy who wades in to helpfully shoot a bunch of people with Lite-Brite lasers. His screen time is limited, however, and this underuse relegates him down to an interesting ingredient in the film's overall soup. Then there is the matter of Channing Tatum. His super-action save-the-day male lead dude is assigned wolf ears. Wolf ears. Ahhhh, and he wears them in a way not unlike the way in which Kevin Costner wore neck gills in Waterworld. Yep, the wolf ears are about that dumb looking. Tatum acts well enough for the role, and has a foundling chemistry with Kunis as well as a plausible embrace de guerre with Bean, his mentor and old friend. But the wolf ears get in the way.As does Eddie Redmayne's whispery, limpid, over-freckled portrayal of the co-villain. A rich space guy whose family needs Earth for, well, let's not spoil it.

252,Robin_clarke41,Wow a big budget movie that's not made by Marvel!,7,15 May 2015,"For the first time in a very long while we have a film released that is:Original Not part of a franchise Not made by Disney, Marvel or Pixar Not featuring a well known superhero Something differentIt seems that movie execs now seem to think that any movie that is not part of a major franchise with unrecognisable characters is doomed to failure. Well to be honest they are now probably right. Movie goers flock in their hoardes to see the latest Iron Man or Avengers incarnation and will without doubt see the latest 3D Disney flick. However the second you put something they don't recognise on the billing they seem to be confused and scared by it. It is OK to try new things! If we never give movies like Jupiter Ascending a go are we to be watching Iron Man 25 in 10 years time? Will there still even be any other film franchises apart from the recognisable superheroes? Why must we insist on watching films we practically know the ending to?Jupiter Ascending is a great Sci-Fi action flick. The story is good and the acting is fantastic from the films several big stars. It is not without its flaws though. It tends to borrow from other movies; Harry Potter, the hunger games and even Star Wars to name a few. The pacing is also a little off as there are more than a few scenes that I thought could have been cut altogether. Overall though I thoroughly enjoyed this film in the same way I would any other action movie. It definitely deserved to do better than it did at the box office. I just think people weren't willing to give it a chance. This may be sad for the U.S. Film industry as studios will no longer be willing to take the chance on something new and original and keep churning out products from the Marvel machine. All great characters had to start somewhere even Indiana Jones!",Jupiter Ascending
253,derbo73,A complete failure,1,19 June 2015,"Wachowski - what has happened to that name? How low can they sink? I don't agree with all their former products, but this is frankly speaking some horse apple that no one would have expected from them.What is so awful in this movie? - the character names (is this a kids movie?) - the acting (yes, you all want to cuddle with Mila, but having a sexy actress doesn't make movies good -except for porn flicks-, and at least I must say, Mila is not sexy at all in this movie) - CGI hell (line it up with Transformers, G.I. Joe and all that other nonsense). I don't say the CGI is badly executed, it is simply used in the wrong way. WAY TO MUCH. - almost everything is stolen from earlier movies, books, comics, computer games- style, technology, character types - the factions are a mess and the way this intergalactic society works is less than unclear, the explanations we get make it look totally unrealistic. -the dialogues are painful...the scene where Jupiter is asked to give up heir title is terrible, for example. It shows that the writers have no trust into the audience to understand even the slightest connections on their own. Everything has to be spoke out aloud...detailed and sloooowly... - the music (it had some music, I am sure. I just can't remember I heard something) - the story (yes, damsel in distress, hero knight, evil antagonist, that is quite OK and can't be original in itself. But unfortunately they didn't even try to enhance this simple concept by one iota to give it it's own colour or touch. You can repeat over and over again, that the hero is soooo tragic because he is looking for his wolf pack and yet must stay alone...it doesn't connect. Had they shown it at any time during the movie, in a flashback or by his behaviour/ticks/problems this could have been interesting. And by the way...how is Jupiter his wolf pack in the end? Oh I forgot, we aren't supposed to ask questions like that or remember anything that happened in the movie longer than 5 minutes ago.)It's such a waste of money, time and talent (the CGI artists are talents). Can't help it, this is what most people think science fiction is about, but these people wouldn't be able to watch Odyssee 2001 to the end and would probably call that a bad movie because it ""doesn't make sense and the end is...weird"".",Jupiter Ascending

258,sean-curtin-517-748378,Amazing overlooked movie.,10,1 March 2015,"In all honesty, this movie scored a 9/10 for me, but I'm giving it 10, because in comparison to what some people have given it, it's totally unfair.First of all, the whole 1D character remarks are unfounded. This is a story told on the run, there isn't room to give you intimate details of each and every character and this doesn't for one second detract from the great story.It's visually spectacular and that's underrating it. Very impressive spacecraft designs, technology, suits, jet packs you name it. Very nice.The story is most straight forward but something many folks are missing is the way it actually explains an awful lot as the movie progresses. The whole grey alien fiasco is nicely incorporated and explained very well. The almost Vampire style story of the upper echelons of the hierachy that rule the universe was stunning.Ultimately there's only one thing I didn't like about this movie and that was the ending which was rather lame after such an action packed stunning movie but it didn't get to me, I still thoroughly enjoyed the movie, I was just hoping for a bigger ending and felt that the ending provided was something of an OK scene but not footage for the finale. (So here's hoping the Blu-ray edition features some alternate endings with much more satisfying grander appeal).This was a great look into an interesting thought provoking and imaginative future. That to me is what this movie was ultimately about, it wasn't a drama to highlight characters(which is sadly what too many people want in a movie. Well to that all I can say, is that your just sounding old people and there's nothing wrong with great ideas all tied together in action. What can I say, go and watch 'Days Of Our Lives' or something if all you want is character depths and dramatisations, some of us enjoy action movies and don't require every single detail of the characters bath room visits explained to us to deepen the character, our imaginations do the work for us).To conclude, this is a movie for people who love Science Fiction and are not afrais of using there imaginations. It's a movie for those who don't require details about everything and can handle amazing visuals(which tell a thousand words but are too often lost to audiences with expectations set on character hash outs and ultimately picked the wrong kind of movie to go and see).Enjoy it for what it is. A different kind of space opera. A refreshing and interesting one. Perhaps the problem is people can only handle Star Wars and everything that came after is just not doing it for them, because they want it all like the one they first discovered and can handle, but ultimately, there should be universes like this one, to push our imaginations further and give us different takes on being human and giving unique visions of humanity in space.Go and enjoy it Sci-Fi fans, it's terrific.",Jupiter Ascending
259,infoalwaysacritic,"Subtley Brilliant, so Subtle Many have Missed it",7,11 April 2015,"""Dimensionless"", ""Unoriginal"", ""Terrible"". All of these words have been used, and many more, to describe Jupiter Ascending as a complete failure of a movie. And I have to tell you, they're wrong. They're not wholly wrong, but after reading 7+ reviews, I can honestly say I think they have missed the point. So here's what I would hope, would help someone to understand what they're looking at if they choose to give this film its worthy chance.First, the story is not bad, it's just missing screen time. That isn't to say that scenes have been cut (they may have) but that more time is spent blowing stuff up than saying important things. Instead, valuable and decisive moments are portrayed in the film, in an efficient and subtle way, leading to the most memorable aspects of the film - the action - to overshadow its brilliance. Reviews I've read have even gone as far as accusing the film of having left certain questions unanswered, while completely missing the fact that they were; the critics have either missed it, or forgot entirely. That isn't to say that the filmmaker is not responsible for that impression, but the dots were there, even if they were small.Here is the correct synopsis of the story the film tells, not the one written on the box:A Young Woman is born to a simple life, but quickly finds herself caught in an intergalactic business squabble, with dire consequences for her family and the world. Befriending an ex-military soldier, with a dishevelled past and an unusual ability to find people, together they fight in their own ways for what they truly want.There is no dramatic reveal outside of a love interest, and there is no conspiracy; no horrible truth to discover. There is no attempt at making this an epic, if anything it introduces you to a world that has epic potential; the story doesn't deal with that and I think that had this movie been made by a different pair of directors, the hate-waggon would not have trampled it so badly in the press.Visually this film is stunning and in line with the greatest modern artwork in science fiction. It stretches from cosmic worlds and space stations, to an incredible refinery complex inside of a planet. This is where the film is at its strongest, in its depiction of a galaxy where humanity has grown beyond the stars. The political structure is larger than the movie, and has nods to the hitch hikers guide to the galaxy among other classic references. Some of the action feels like run of the mill TV, but for the most part the world is stunningly realized.The female character is the focus of the plot, and she is quirky and sometimes even stupid. When she finally figures some things out, she is willing to sacrifice for what she believes. For the most part, this portrayal of a primary character is difficult to digest for mainstream audiences. She isn't strong, she's silly. She becomes infatuated at several points, with worthless things. Her relatives say as much when she asks for money, and her first meeting with Channing Tatum's character is in the midst of such a foolish decision. She is hard to like, because she doesn't exemplify good decisions or innocence and a struggles to see the larger picture. She is selfishly motivated looking for short term happiness and rushes things. She is contrasted against another character that doesn't know what he wants, but is unconsciously fighting for it the whole time.The result is a quirky, somewhat confusing series of events that envelope around them, outside of their control, but the point is that those events don't make sense to the characters. Is this contrary to the popular mindset of films in an era dominated by Marvel sequels? Yes, and for my part, delightfully so. The number of stories being told today where the primary characters are not empowered, or the impetus behind events, who are not proactive but tragically reactive, are in short supply.Conclusion: Subtle goodness lies beneath the visual spectacle, but you must be willing to let go of the omniscient perspective, and allow the world to be bigger than the story.",Jupiter Ascending

262,MovieRat-2,Entertaining space opera,8,9 March 2015,"I honestly do not understand the hate and poor box office numbers for this film. The visuals were absolutely stunning. The universe of the story is truly epic in scale and scope. The acting was decent except for a few minor points: Eddie Redmayne's Belam is always talking at a whisper (SPEAK UP!); Channing Tatum's Caine is unemotional to almost robotic levels; and Mila Kunis's Jupiter is unrealistically taking the existence of aliens and everything that is happening to her waaaay to calmly.Looking back, the one thing that I think truly hurts this film's acceptance by audiences and critics is the story. The story is epic...unfortunately, I think the Wachowski's tried to show too much in a very limited 2 hours. People have complained that the story felt rushed at times, which is indeed true. But does that mean the movie is bad and not entertaining? No, it is still an incredibly well made and well told movie for what the Wachowski's were limited by.Despite this, I believe the story would have played out masterfully over several installments like a TV or anime series.",Jupiter Ascending
263,PrashunChakraborty,So much squandered potential,6,12 February 2015,"I have always liked the Wachowskis, they are mad geniuses of of modern action science fiction films and always push the limit of what we can see on film. They have made great movies (Matrix still remains their biggest hit though) but when their last film Cloud Atlas was released, my like turned into genuine love for these sibling directors it was an unprecedented science fiction film likes of which may never be seen again. That being said I was really looking forward to Wachowskis' Jupiter Ascending even though word on the street was not very good. Earth and all other planets in the galaxy are ruled by a powerful family- Abrasax, Three Abrasax siblings rule a third of the galaxy each. All three are cunning, manipulative, power hungry and distrustful of one another. Jupiter Jones (Mila Kunis) is of special interest to them all as she is the supposed reincarnation of their mother the undisputed galactic queen and may lead to disruption of power. Since Earth falls under the empire of the eldest sibling Balem (Eddie Redmayne) he serves as the main antagonist for the film, he'd see Jupiter dead and his brother and sister fall back in line. Caine (Channing Tatum) is Jupiter's protector and yes the unnecessary romantic interest. Revealing rest would spoil the movie. Jupiter Ascending's stage setting and sci-fi back story is amazing and a lot of work has gone into it and this makes the movie till the first half very interesting but once the second half hits and all the players and the backstory has been revealed the quality of the film takes a huge nosedive and it becomes cluttered with one too many action sequences. The action sequences themselves are well done and really pushes the medium of action scenes in science fiction even though it's very CGI heavy but that comes with the genre's territory. A very noteworthy point to be mentioned is that the film looks very futuristic, the technology looks centuries ahead of Star Trek and Guardians of Galaxy thus I think it would be great if Disney can get the Wachowskis for one of their Star Wars film they can do great stuff with in their world. The acting is surprisingly decent as well considering the leads. I hope to get a Directors Cut of Jupiter Ascending because some preliminary research has yielded that the studio butchered significant story sequences of the film to make it shorter. Why they cut story/lore building scenes and not action scenes is beyond me because Jupiter Ascending's world building is beautiful and great. However I am still waiting for the 4 Hour Director's Cut of Cloud Atlas first, Wachowskis have been teasing that for years. Jupiter Ascending's Director's Cut would make the film good and complete and dare I say even great. All in all, Jupiter Ascending is a mixed bag, it has high concept and ideas, decently executed too and is visually stunning but the story within the setting is just terrible. But I will take Jupiter Ascending with all its flaws over a generic action film which may have a better but safe, serviceable corporate story which keeps the franchise running. Still rated it higher than it deserved simply because it's bold and there is potential for quality sequels.",Jupiter Ascending

266,filmfanperspective,The Wachowskis swing and miss,4,5 May 2015,"History will suggest that Jupiter Ascending was an utter disaster; it teeters ever so close to the edge of that, but a disaster it isn't. Consider the sad state of affairs for blockbuster story ideas in Hollywood when I'm praising a bad film for trying. Lana and Andy Wachowski, the sibling duo behind the ambitious, and occasionally brilliant Matrix trilogy and the wonderful Cloud Atlas, have created a monstrosity with their new film. It makes little sense, suffers from a lack of focus, is loud and dumb, and is utterly forgettable- but I absolutely adore that someone out there bothered with an attempt to make an original blockbuster, and well, it is beautiful to gaze upon.Channing Tatum co-stars as Caine, a genetically engineered, half man/half wolf bounty hunter with a past. This past is not integral to the plot, but it is included anyway to give his character more of an 'edge'. His mission is to track down Jupiter Jones (Kunis), a young woman who may or may not be the 'recurrence' of a dead alien queen. Tatum and Kunis actually do develop some decent chemistry in their roles, and manage to give the film some much-needed charm, even if it barely lasts. Kunis is her usual stunningly beautiful self, but her ability to pull of humility is what solidifies her in the role. Tatum and his abs ""air-skate"" through the movie, much of it with his shirt off for the pleasure of 'oglers' everywhere.It says a great deal about the rest of the film that they're the only ones that seem to be having any fun, however. The convoluted plot finds Jupiter hunted by various factions, some interested in her claim to various worlds (including Earth), some interested in just plain killing her. Balem Abrasax (Redmayne), the current big man on the universal campus, is the baddie here, apparently suffering from some sort of laryngitis along the way. If I hadn't been assured from critics everywhere that his performance in The Theory of Everything was brilliant, I'd have wondered if Redmayne was actually trying for 'most miscalculated delivery ever'. Not only is it a difficult performance to watch and listen to, the character doesn't make much sense. What is his problem, really? If Jupiter is truly the reincarnation of his mother, wouldn't that be a good thing? If he's the ruler of the universe, why would he risk everything for Earth? Is he not aware of global warming or the depletion of our natural resources?Let's not forget the Abrasax siblings, specifically Titus (Booth). Space Caligula here wants Jupiter- yes, his mother reincarnated, for his wife. Sure, we know that he's just interested in her hereditary claims and titles, but the thought is still disgusting, right? Jupiter, as grounded as she is, sees no choice in the matter, for if she doesn't relent, Balem can and will 'harvest' the Earth. This 'harvest' I speak of? I won't spoil it, but let's just say the film never bothers to present it as starkly as is necessary- yet another missed opportunity. Kalique (Middleton), the other sibling, is just as gross and awful. The sibling rivalry is akin to a midday soap opera, substituting Romanesque archetypes instead of wealthy urbanites.Similar in many ways to Luc Besson's The Fifth Element, The Wachowskis have created a world with this film in which they were allowed to play at will, and seemingly spend money at will. Make no mistake- those dollars ($179 million of them) are on-screen here. They've made a miscalculation on what the film should have been, however. When your title has Jupiter in it, and the gas giant is prominently featured in the film, one should take the time to properly explore the awe of the planet itself. I envision this whole idea working with a change of tone and a change of focus. Instead of a popcorn flick, why not take an additional chance and make this an abstract, strictly sci-fi film? Why not let the wonder of a familiar yet still mysterious planet be the centerpiece of your film? Why not make the horror of the 'harvests' the real villain and not the painfully typical Emperor Emphysema? Instead of generic action cues for music, why not have the great Michael Giacchino develop something inspired? Maybe he had little to inspire him? Likely.Jupiter Ascending never quite reaches the 'so awful that you should create a drinking game to mock it' level, but it certainly never aspires to be great. The Wachowskis should know better than to play it lame like this, for this critic believes they're quite capable of the greatness, making this all the more disappointing. The Wachowski's seeming obsession with messiahs or saviors is on clear display, when a better, more watchable film is well within their grasp, especially with the budget allotment they received. At the same time, I hope this grand financial failure isn't the figurative nail in the coffin for their creativity. I hope they continue to get opportunities to showcase their abilities. I also hope they use some of that creativity to reign themselves in, to find ways of producing films with more focus and direction. After all, that is what Jupiter Ascending so desperately lacks- and that's all on the filmmakers.",Jupiter Ascending

271,Necroambulant,"Visually Worthwhile, Otherwise Not",7,14 May 2015,"Jupiter Ascending is most certainly not going to be thought of as a masterpiece by anyone...ever. Especially when following so close on the heels of Interstellar, which set the bar pretty high as far as science fiction is concerned. It's more than a little bit on the cheesy side...and the narrative, in addition to being ludicrously over-the-top, jumps around in a seemingly pointless and distracting manner. Visually, it's pretty, and the special effects work is excellent, but that is hardly enough to salvage what was essentially a joke of a story. The acting was surprisingly good for being contained with the vessel of this movie...even where Channing Tatum was concerned, though he definitely wouldn't earn any awards for his performance, and he looked ridiculous in the makeup for the role (imagine James Hetfield of Metallica as an elf in Lord of the Rings and you will be coming somewhat close). Not that anyone would ever expect Tatum to merit any sort of award for acting outside of Teen Choice or MTV Movie Award shows, unless he really kicks it up a notch. Ultimately, the movie was just fun enough to be worth watching, once you get past the abysmally cobbled together story. There are some fairly interesting and enjoyable action sequences as well as some rare instances when the script doesn't feel like it was written by an adolescent comic book fanatic with ADHD who happened to watch The Fifth Element and Battlefield Earth a few dozen times. I can't help but feel like there should have been some point where someone sat down with the Wachowski's and told them that the whole movie needed to be edited in a way that made it watchable, but if that happened, they declined...and the movie I just watched is what we get as a result. I really wanted to like this movie, after all, I love science fiction...but that love of science fiction may be the only thing that made this movie palatable for me. It isn't a great movie, it barely even qualifies as being good. If you have other things you've been dying to watch, I would say that you're safe to watch them instead of this, but for lack of anything else to watch, this one will do in a pinch.

274,corceiro,"noise, colors, shots, and trivial effects are not enough to make a good movie",2,11 May 2015,"The first ""Matrix"" movie was a very witty and absorbing film, but since that distant work of art, the Wachowski brothers never did anything truly interesting. ""Cloud Atlas"" was an O.K. movie but this ""Jupiter Ascending"" is just an incredible amount of messy visual effects, not enough to create a narrative that holds the viewer. There are ideas and concepts in Lana and Andy's heads, I'm sure but they are being filtered for that blind desire to create a great box office success. The story, the characters and dialogues are a distressing banality. The direction becomes boring in the middle of so many digital Gothic settings and weird creatures. Lana and Andy, you need a good, solid and interesting story like the ones in Coen brothers movies, not a lot of boring ideas from the world of science fiction, please return to that minimalistic and dark universe of ""Matrix"", that was good and enough. Lana and Andy please watch ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" again and make me buy a DVD of one of you films even if I have watched it ten times before. Less noise and effects with better characters and storytelling could made a great movie from the prime idea of ""Jupiter Ascending"".",Jupiter Ascending
275,speedy-droid,Completely Mis-Cast,6,8 February 2015,"After 3 complete viewings, I finally realized that what is really a great story falls completely FLAT for one very specific reason...The WORST casting that I've seen in a movie in a Long, Long Time...I'm not saying that any of the actors in the film are bad actors, just that they are completely wrong for these particular characters.1) Mila Kunis: There is absolutely Nothing Regal about her. Even before she knows who she really is and is cleaning toilets, this character should still have been portrayed by someone who can act in that manner that portrays ""Unintentional Regality."" I would have chosen Emily Blunt. If only Cate Blanchett were 20 years younger... Perfection!2) Eddie Redmayne: I would have taken a different tack with this character. He's the most powerful person in the most powerful family, running the richest and most powerful empire in the known Universe. In my opinion, the character should have been less ""Queen Elizabeth I"", and more... ""Mafioso""Balem Abrasax, in my opinion, wouldn't be a slender, fragile-looking man-child, who has absolutely no control over his own temper. He would be a quiet, evil-looking mafia lord who constantly looked like he planning all of the different ways that he could slit your throat in less than one-tenth of a second.I would definitely have picked Jason Statham for this role.3) Channing Tatum: Absolutely WRONG for this role. He just can't be the ""Bad Guy"" convincingly enough. Definitely should have been Hugh Jackman.4) Sean Bean: His style should have been Perfect for this character. But throughout the whole movie, I just got the feeling that his heart wasn't in it. Did the Wachowskis upset him in some way?5) Nikki Amuka-Bird: No WAY is this girl the captain of an elite ship in the primary armed forces of the known universe. If you're a female filling this role in the ""Jupiter Ascending"" Universe, you have Most Definitely shattered all of the typical female stereotypes. You bathe a maximum of twice per week... if you have the time... and you are a BAD MO-FO!Definitely... Michelle Rodriguez or Ronda Rousey6) Jeremy Swift: As the House Patriarch, he had very good presence. His character was under-used. I would have loved to have seen a nice action scene with him at the end (climax) of the film. Like... Grabbing the winged Lizard-thing by the tail at the very last moment, giving the Caine Wise character just enough time to activate the glass-hole thingy that choked him to death. Then, Jeremy Swift would have said something like, ""Ukrainian Justice, Lizard-Man!""",Jupiter Ascending
276,DrLex,Hard to believe this is made by the same people who brought us The Matrix,5,26 May 2015,"How this movie seems to have been created: 1. Take all movie clichés known to mankind. Throw them together. 2. Find more clichés, if needed invent some new ones, and add them to the pile. Make sure to include something from every known historical period: the Jurassic period, the Roman empire, the Victorian era, and so on. 3. Blend it. Blend it like your life depends on it! Mix that Roman empire with dinosaurs, robots, space ships, and Victorian machinery! 4. Pour visual effects sauce over it. Keep doing this until every pixel of the screen is a visual effect. If 'The Chronicles of Riddick' looked baroque, this film must look baroque squared. 5. Find some shallow and simple story to tie all this together.The result is entertaining in the same way as a roller-coaster ride: it is fun for the first five minutes, but when you keep on doing it for two hours straight, it makes you sick.I actually did not know this was written and directed by the Wachowskis until I saw the end credits. What happened to their skill of using a perfect dose of special effects to tell a multi-layered story?The only good thing about this film is the visual aspect. It looks nice. Kudos to the people working on the CGI. The problem however is that there is way too much of it, a common problem with recent attempts at blockbusters. There is so much to see that eventually there is nothing interesting to see. 'The Matrix' was visually quite sober most of the time, and this is what made its effects stand out. In Jupiter Ascending, everything is spectacular from the first to the last minute, which results in nothing being spectacular at all. It is the visual equivalent of the 'loudness wars' in music. A spectator who is spammed with a non-stop visual overload, eventually does not care about anything anymore, no matter how spectacular it is. They will start focusing on the acting and story, and noticing that there is simply nothing of interest there.The acting is ho-hum, some of the actors seem to be even more confused about what kind of a mess they have been cast into, than us spectators. The story is made to sound complex but it is just a paper thin idea padded with expensive words and pseudoscience, and vague hints at trying to bring important messages that get entirely lost in all the noise.I mentioned The Chronicles of Riddick before, which is conceptually very similar but which I found much more entertaining. Maybe it was because at least one of the characters did have a back-story and acted as if he cared. Jupiter Rising on the other hand seems like an example of what can go wrong when technological advances allow to show anything on-screen a director wants, and they cannot decide what to pick from all the possibilities, so they simply pick everything that exists and throw it together.",Jupiter Ascending
277,Mike-Bear,Not a review! Maybe feedback!? Actually would be better say that it is a letter.,7,21 April 2015,"Dear Andy and Lana Wachowski, I know the chances that you will read it very low, but anyway I hope on it. I waited this movie more than one year and a half. When I have seen first trailer that was available online I was impressed and curious about what exactly this movie will be. I watched this movie more than 5, maybe 7 times (from January to March), on Russian and English languages. I did not write any review or feedback before because I waited final rating and interested in viewers reaction. I could not do anything just because I was shocked of all this negative reviews and decreasing rating rating (6.7; 6.5; 6.2 finally it stops on 5.9). In my opinion viewers reaction was too sharp and not reasonably accurate. However those reactions have evidence and reasons in a movie ""Jupiter Ascending"".Firstly, thank you so much for mentioning exactly Russian immigrants in the United States of America and city Saint-Petersburg in Russia which is not popular as an Moscow. Secondly this movie made impression on me for sure, but I feel that this movie was made in a pressure, rush and without final conception of idea. Pressure. Feeling of the pressure in this movie feasible and reasonable because when I heard something about movie ""Jupiter Ascending"", I also heard about George Lucas's ""Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens"", plus success of the movie ""Hunger Games"" might be cause of nervous and unrest, and of course situation of reschedule of the release date was always reminded with unpleasant feeling and contrast. Rush.Unfortunately momentarily during watching this movie I had a feeling like some part or nuances were made in a rush, like by student who did his homework in a subway or by white collar who just get a new idea from his head after hangover. I hope my prediction is wrong and the scene in rural area was planned and done not in a couple days. Without final conception of idea. Structure and conception about global manipulation, and controlling feasible, but it is not serious and deep compare with previous work ""Matrix"". During watching a movie I am not afraid about main characters, just because I know that they will survive and nothing serious happened. Additionally I used to have such a strong feeling that ""Balem"" and ""Titus"" weaker even ""Chicanery Night"". Thankfully ""Kalique Abrasax"" looks like a real ""Darth Vader"" and ""Snow Queen"" daughter! Seriously!Some examples why people reaction was too sharp (In my opinion!): 1. When Mila Kunis ""Jupiter Jones"" cleans toilets, her face not showing emotions of sadness or tiredness. Unfortunately ""Jupiter Jones"" has face ""Lily / The Black Swan"" from the movie ""Black Swan"" (2010). 2. On a roof Doona Bae ""Razo"" describes Channing Tatum ""Caine Wise"" and Spencer Wilding ""Falque"" asking her ""How do you know that?"". She responded ""Shoes\Boots"". After this I expected Ben Affleck or Jeremy Renner from ""The Town"" (2010). 3. I do not know why, but Channing Tatum ""Caine Wise"" still associate for me with ""Jenko"" from the movie ""Jump Street"" and ""Tyler Gage"" from the movie ""Step Up"". However he played well in a ""Foxcatcher"" (2014), ""White House Down"" (2013) and ""The Eagle"" (2011), but he is not looks ""Caine Wise"" in my imagination. 4. Kick Gurry ""Vladie"" looks like Dave Sheridan ""Doofy"" from the movie ""Scary Movie"" (2000). 5. When Mila Kunis ""Jupiter Jones"" proceed registration and verify her title, I had a feeling of cliché. This moment in a movie reminds me Daniel Radcliffe in the movie ""Harry Potter"" when Harry buying different things on the Diagon Alley and been in Gringotts Bank.6. Mila Kunis ""Jupiter Jones"" speaking in a movie like a rural 14 years old girl from Russia, instead of speaking like teenager or youth from Brooklyn. Unfortunately there is no ""Belle"" in a movie. 7. During the wedding procession between Mila Kunis ""Jupiter Jones"" and Douglas Booth ""Titus Abrasax"", Channing Tatum ""Caine Wise"" and Sean Bean ""Stinger Apini"" burst through the siege of stormtroopers. The interesting thing that I am not curious and I know for sure that Channing Tatum ""Caine Wise"" will save Mila Kunis ""Jupiter Jones"". Regrettably this moment in a movie ""Jupiter Ascending"" did not became culmination of beautiful fighting like in ""Matrix"", etc.In my opinion Andy and Lana Wachowski great in ""Body"" but not in the ""Introduction"" and ""Conclusion"". Nevertheless I think they must change and update those team. I hope Andy and Lana Wachowski will not depressed and sad for a long time. I wish you good health, new inspiration for the future projects and luck on movie arena. I am looking forward to watch continue of ""Jupiter Ascending"". Only forward, no gloomy mood, depression or stepping back! I am sure for 120% that continue of ""Jupiter Ascending"" will be totally the same as ""The Matrix Reloaded"" (2003). Tremendous, spectacular and remarkable!Good luck. Respectfully, Mike Bear.",Jupiter Ascending
278,RobertLThorpe,The lowest expectations were not even met,2,7 February 2015,"WoW! I went in only wanting some really good original scifi and this didn't even come close to meeting that low expectation. There had already been rumors that the cast hated the film, Kunis already said she thought is was terrible. The reviews have ALL been bad, but I hate reviews. Rarely are the critics right. This film has NO story, It is so convoluted and filled egocentric directing. Clearly the Wachowski brother and sister team are just living off the Matrix. There is no chemistry to the main characters and the acting is MONOTONED throughout. There are so many plot holes which all movies of this nature have, but so many that it is no longer even followable, if that is a word. i won't give spoilers but, lets just say that there is not one shred of continuity within the story that makes it make sense. The characters, especially Tatums was not ever challenged, never did I say he won't make it, or get there or do this or that, you just knew he would and it was ALWAYS easy. Kunis as well as the rest of the cast looked like cardboard cutouts, for a moment I though George Lucas directed it.. Its just bad.",Jupiter Ascending
279,amalank,Falls flat,5,7 February 2015,"Jupiter Ascending is the latest offering from the Wachowski siblings who brought us The Matrix.It stars the stunningly looking Mila Kunis as the protagonist who is destined to have a bright future but instead works a dead end job cleaning the toilets. She is then helped by Channing Tatum's character to meet that destiny.I have been aware of this movie for a while and had been looking forward to it. The delay of the movie made me more eager to watch it. I was a bit surprised when the first votes for this movie weren't very good. Nevertheless I was still wanting to watch it. It seems that the votes are now justified.The Wachowskis tried to make a complex storyline like they did with The Matrix but unfortunately it didn't work out. A lot of the story elements either weren't explained at all or not explained properly.While the visual effects were stunning, the same can't be said for the action sequences which were ruined by the camera-work making them more difficult to enjoy.Eddie Redmayne, who recently did a good job as Stephen Hawking in The Theory of Everything, sadly falls flat as a villain in this movie, especially his voice which was not as menacing as it should have been.One redeeming factor is that it does have one or two comic moments. Perhaps a bit more would have been nice.While the movie started off fairly well, it gradually lost its steam. Overall the wait was not worth it. I didn't get what I wanted from it. You're better off watching The Matrix or Inception again.",Jupiter Ascending
280,axel335,This film is awful,2,15 July 2018,"Now here are we talking about a really, really bad movie. Nothing works in this movie. Its extremely boring, the plot doesn't make sense and the actor walk around with an facial expression saying: what I'm doing in this mess? Above all that's the movie is pretentious and tries to be ""serious"" which fails pretty dismantle. The worst actor in this mess is the evil guy that walks around and whispers all the time. I guess the director thought that would be cool or creepy but it was nothing like that. Me and my son laugh so hard at this stupidity. Another extremely silly scene is the one in the barn where the bees attacks the queen but she doesn't get hurt. Then this moron that hangs around with the queen says: well you don't get hurt because the bees are trained not to hurt royalties. Really????

This really fells like a B-movie (at the best) pimped up by a few CGI-effects. Mila Kunis is just as a bad actor as always (she was cute in the 70's show) -, but the biggest surprise is that the rest of the movie, and actors, are indeed on the same low- quality level. Lots of supposedly pretty faces are over-acting here, and it becomes even worse when they are trying to copy Star Wars quotes. This is by far the worst movie I have seen for at least 10 years (Since the Aviator) - I am both disappointed and pretty p*ssed off. I was really suffering trying to finish to watch this movie. There is absolutely nothing quality left since the Matrix 1era. I would like to quote Star Wars and Dart Vader in a far better way than this movie: ""Now his failure is complete!""

283,rudolfravbar,Pretty decent movie.,7,23 March 2015,"I don't understand some stuff about reviews. Is it just me or some movies are really underrated? I don't really know.Jupiter Jones was born under a night sky, with signs predicting that she was destined for great things. Now grown, Jupiter dreams of the stars but wakes up to the cold reality of a job cleaning other people's houses and an endless run of bad breaks. Only when Caine Wise, a genetically engineered ex-military hunter, arrives on Earth to track her down does Jupiter begin to glimpse the fate that has been waiting for her all along - her genetic signature marks her as next in line for an extraordinary inheritance that could alter the balance of the cosmos.As I was saying at the beginning, Jupiter Ascending seem a bit underrated. The story and a whole plot seems pretty decent. Story is well made in this movie. I can tell same as directing, of course. The ending of this movie is pretty predictable, so don't wait for something not seen.Acting in this movie is also not bad. Channing Tatum and Mila Kunis gave their best. Also, Eddie Redmayne did great! I was impressed. After his Oscar winning role of Steve Hawking, this came perfect. It's, of course, not good as Hawking.Special effects are sometimes good, sometimes bad, I can't tell. I was impressed when I saw rising in a space ship. Wise's gravity boots are pretty decent made, but some explosions and some shooting are not done well.There are some political interests in this movie, but they are boring and I think that they could remove them. They are just making a movie longer.Soundtracks are done well and they fit in as well.At the end, this movie is really good, but I'm not recommending it to everybody.

284,albertusjohannesmaria,transparent piggies that rescue any situation,1,5 February 2015,"Words cannot describe how terrible this movie is. Jupiter Ascending is something like Cinderella in space, with evil kings and queens and Mila Kunis as Cinderella. Channing Tatum is the knight on the white horse, except his horse is exchanged by rocket shoes. Mila falls into deep space like every 5 minutes and Channing rescues her with his great shoes. They dangle and dangle, but she doesn't look scared a bit, because there is nothing to be scared of in front of the green screen. Seriously, do these directors really think I am waiting for a talking reptile? Or transparent piggies that rescue any situation like guardian angels do?

286,Junreviews,Jupiter descended from Cloud Atlas,3,11 February 2015,"As an avid fan of Sci-Fi and as someone who was elated by Wachowski's last film, ""Cloud Atlas"" that managed to beautifully depict both originality from the book and an intertwining connection between notable cast who played several roles to the hilt, I am so stunned and disappointed by how contrary ""Jupiter Ascending"" is to their previous successors.The trailer sure looks amazing enough to pull the wool over my eyes as it showcases spectacular visuals of futuristic environment and costumes along with an attractive heroine and a warrior with Spock ears in scintillating gears who pit villainous monsters. There is no doubt that the Wachowskis are capable of leading the crews to visualize the most realistic and yet imaginative images of how the future should look like.So who to blame when the movie with such a visual and tons of potential gets wasted by sloppy, incomplete, and intricate plot and editing? Sadly, it all goes to the directors. Because the acting isn't that much of an issue despite the roles for Mila Kunis, Channing Tatum, Eddie Redmayne and Sean Bean do not give as much impact as their reputation. Especially, Eddie Redmayne's character is awkwardly degraded due to his obscure personality with no special abilities. Refreshed Doona Bae from ""Cloud Atlas"" appearing as Razo, the impassive rider with blue dreadlocks also lacks its presence by being dully impassive and inertial. This is why plot and directing should sometimes go extreme to unleash all the potential of each character so that they conform to the flow of context.And if there are several races vying for the reign, heir or whatever it makes them greatest, why wouldn't they adorn some magical prowess or unique characteristics to the spearheads. Although, the flying shoes and the transparent shield looks well-designed and impressive, but a lack of details and elements of each race needs to be more specified and explained in a clear manner. Aforementioned, the concept of the setting is indeed remarkable and splendid. Too bad they couldn't capitalize them to take it to the next level. The same thing goes to the battle sequence. When an ambush from a horde of enemy spacecrafts in the middle of Downtown Chicago that leads to a fast-paced fray transpires, none of cars and citizens in periphery is nowhere to be seen as if it is staged just for the fighters. There is no excitement or nerves involved because it literally makes you feel like no matter how much of a barrage of attacks or threats they face, it makes you think that an invincible hero will eventually fall in love with the heroine by overcoming the forbidden boundary pronto at the end, thus there are numerous stuffs that remain unfinished, which flummoxes the audience in many ways.It has been a while since I've written my review this much and I think that is because I truly care about the possibilities of this long-awaited Wachowskis' work. The attempt for ""Jupiter Ascending 2"" does not look risky and improbable, if they want to make it up for all the bad reviews and critiques. Regardless, I will be looking forward to what they have in store no matter what they are. Arrivederci!",Jupiter Ascending
287,AkelaLoneWolf,Neat movie despite its faults and clichés,6,4 June 2015,"My first impression after watching was that it was a neat little piece by the Wachowskis and that it failed to get its fair share of attention and acclaim from the critics or the media. Indeed it was seemingly a cliché story of how a mundane young caretaker was in fact the recurrence-reincarnation of the matriarch of a powerful dynasty, and how different powers tried to lure her, side with her or even kill her. But the visuals and the concepts introduced were crisp and bracing - the idea that life on Earth was seeded for later harvest echoed faintly to the Wachowski team's earlier works. The actions were breathtaking though the timing might be more creative; hard to swallow scenes of the chief protagonist nearly jeopardizing her life while her comrades fought to rescue her - repeatedly. Another point lacking originality was Jupiter's cross-class romance with a lycanite. One thing that touched me and made this a intergalactic sci-fi cult flick for (selected) female audience is perhaps Jupiter's undaunted spirit and fiery kindness - reminding us of Dorothy in the Wizard of Oz - and the way she took fate into her own hands after being thrown into a whirlwind-like new world was admirable.",Jupiter Ascending

Gravity vector surfing boots? Spacesuit in a box? invisible shielding -- OK, that's been done before, but rarely on the scale or with the slickness of this film. Fabulous CGI -- well worth the additional tweaking that went on. It could have been one hot mess -- involved story lines, gigantic milieu to offer and explain, tangled corporate information, complex familial relationships. But the Wachowskis deliver it all up with laser focus, and you never get so snowed in by characters or situations that you lose your way. From the seemingly simple beginning to the equally seemingly simple ending, you are kept to a logical course that allows you to accept some very complex details without a hiccup. The plot line is so focused that the audience accepts willingly the vast implications of the bigger picture.

You'd swear they have a grudge against the Wachowskis. I admit that the script could have been a little less predictable, but still! How many good movies come out each year? If it comes out one or two that's great. In this film, the authors have really given all their expertise with an ultra talented team with a very appropriate choice of actors. The characters are amazing, extremely well designed, whether for CGI or the characters played by actors. I really was knocked down from beginning to end.

293,houghtonetet,Ambitious creation but room for improvement,7,11 February 2015,"Here is the Wachowskis' introduction to a new reality, the 'Verse, in which they clearly hope to hang many more stories than this visually impressive ""pilot"" episode.A simple plot is dressed up with stunning CGI set pieces that keep the pace bounding along at a most enjoyable rate. I have to say that the special effects are really quite astonishing, even in this age of superlative computer generated marvels. An awful lot has clearly been spent on the visuals and it pays off big-time. If you like a simple boom-bang-boom movie with a lot of things blowing up and even more highly improbable death-defying absurdity, then JA is definitely for you. For Heaven's sake see it on the big screen while you can, you won't be disappointed.On the negative side, the script is forgettable and the acting is wooden. Mila Kunis and Eddie Redmayne are better actors than this, I can only assume the Wachowskis were so excited about their creation they forgot to direct the title character to show any sort of surprise or incredulity at the truth about the starry galaxy she has always dreamed of. Even worse was Redmayne's delivery, which bordered on the ridiculous.The plot was fairly simple, and has been told many times before – a common person is destined for greatness but encounters powerful enemies, intent on denying that person's birthright. The enemies in this case are a power-mad family of monsters who keep themselves youthfully immortal by bathing in the vilest potion imaginable. Jupiter discovers she is a family member but after defeating the chief villain and claiming her inheritance rejects it all by going back to her day job. (A trifle unbelievable).I generally liked the 'Verse but would have liked to know more about it. The Abraxas family were bound by legalities, and there was a police force and a complex bureaucracy, which all hinted at an Executive, a stock market, and a law enforcement agency/army/navy – the tripod on which all civilization stands.

I could on and on about the movies it rips off.You don't need a movie with big details, complicated back stories, unrealistic names 'Jupiter Jones', people looking serious never showing emotions and tons of explosions. If you want great action movies with sci-fi watch Star Wars or the Matrix.",Jupiter Ascending
296,ryandannar,"""Jupiter"" is Underrated, Campy Good Time!",6,11 February 2015,"Despite the bad reviews I've read, I have to admit that I found the Wachowskis' latest, ""Jupiter Ascending,"" to be a whole lot of fun. Dumb as a box of rocks? Yup. Confusing in its details? Sure. A bit miscast? Yes, I'd say.And yet these aren't necessarily faults in such a film as this. If you are expecting the Wachowskis to deliver another ""Matrix""-style mindblower here, dismiss those notions immediately. If, however, you can imagine enjoying a deliriously campy space-opera in which a lowly cleaner of toilet-bowls learns that she is the reincarnated Queen of the Universe, and falls in love with a shirtless dog-man on space-rollerblades -- well, you won't find a juicier, more hilarious ticket than this one.Mila Kunis plays Jupiter Jones, a child of Russian immigrants living in Chicago with her extended family. She works for their housecleaning business and wakes up each morning saying, ""I hate my life."" However, as chance or fate would have it, her DNA happens to be an exact match for the former matriarch of the Abrasax dynasty, a dysfunctional family of nigh-immortal humanoids who are among the richest and most powerful creatures in the universe. One way or another, three Abrasax siblings find out about Jupiter Jones' existence, and seek to end it -- or so it would seem; they are not, as we quickly discover, all working from the same agenda.Channing Tatum is Caine Wise, a former space-marine of some sort who was created in a lab, I guess, from a splice of human and dog DNA. He's called a lycantant, and he's got some nifty boots that let him zoom around shirtless over city skylines, just like with rollerblades, but in the air. (If such a notion doesn't strike you as at least a little bit funny, then you are probably not in the right mood to enjoy this movie.) Wise is dispatched to Earth to find Jones, and to escort her safely back to the one Abrasax sibling who may want to help her claim her birthright.Because see, Galactic Law or some such nonsense dictates that Jones, possessing DNA which is 100% identical to that of the former Abrasax matriarch, should rightfully assume the former matriarch's position as head of the Abrasax clan -- and thus, basically, Queen of the Universe.These Abrasax, though... they are wily creatures! See, their longevity -- as well as their power and wealth -- is predicated upon the manufacture, use, and sale of a substance they call by several names. This substance is essentially Life In A Bottle; drink it, or bathe in it, and you'll find yourself looking and feeling decades younger. But this stuff is a Soylent Green, you see. It's made out of people!And not just a few people! In riff off the same ideas which fueled the Wachowskis' ""Matrix"" films, we learn that the Earth is one of an untold number of planets which are owned by the Abrasax, and which are treated like cattle-farms. The Abrasax seed these planets with human life (we are all descendants of the Abrasax, it turns out) -- and then, once conditions are right, they harvest all the humans on that planet, processing and liquefying them into the glowing white goo they built their dynasty upon.This is really just the basic setup of this overstuffed, ludicrous, ultra-high-concept film. I feel like I should note, at this point, that while the movie plays everything absolutely straight, I'm fairly convinced that the Wachowskis knew just how ridiculous this material was. I think they dearly love this kind of cheese, and they wanted to bring it to the screen in high style. I think they want you to laugh, and to be entertained, and I don't think they want you to take the movie half as seriously as the movie seems to take itself. I think the relative seriousness, or dryness of tone, functions as a kind of poker-face, enhancing the camp by seeming to insist on its importance. And I'm half-convinced that this was the intention.Did I also mention that it looks very, very good? I am not a fan of CGI, and this movie uses a ton of it -- and yet, I was intrigued by the level of visual detail on the screen. Many of the production- design choices are just very nice. For instance: A landing-bay in the side of a lavish royal star-cruiser, illuminated not by harsh, military- grade recessed lighting, but by hundreds of warmly-glowing crystal chandeliers, like a stately ballroom. Other design choices aren't quite as inspired (one locale looked for all the world like Rivendell, from Lord of the Rings, to me). But even these have a level of detail and visual flourish not commonly seen, even in big- budget tentpole space-epics.What I believe the Wachowskis have provided here is a tricked-out 21st-century update to the campy, B-grade science-fiction films of years gone by. Remember ""Flash Gordon,"" that 1980s camp sci-fi classic scored by Queen? Or ""The Fifth Element,"" that ludicrous and colorful space-romp from 1997? I found ""Jupiter Ascending"" to function on about that level. Those with a realistic mindset have no business watching a film like this. But if you can appreciate poker- faced camp presented with high style -- if you dig top-notch eye- candy, and if my description of this movie's plot made you laugh a little, in a good way, then you'll be of the right mind to enjoy this film.",Jupiter Ascending
297,ice ruby red,One Interminable Chase Scene After Another,5,9 July 2016,"If you love chase scenes, this is the film for you! (Thank God for fast-forward!!)I love Sci-Fi and Fantasy, and hoped that Jupiter Ascending would provide some of the elements I look for in a movie. It provided virtually none.While there were some spectacular effects, such as the hero skating through the sky on luminous gravity boots, and a magical moment featuring rings that I found beautiful, it wasn't enough to warrant the price of the movie. I did enjoy the spectacular flight over the Chicago River, since I'm from Chicago, but aside from that I thought the eternity of bad guys chasing good guys would never end. And it didn't...The whole movie was rife with chase scenes! God knows, it wasn't based on much of a story, nor character development! I could not have been less interested in Jupiter and her loosely explained birthright, nor in the ""romance"" that lacked development and passion.There is such a thing as too much CGI, as this film proves. I sure wish that filmmakers would create more movies with great stories, interesting characters, and charismatic actors. My personal favorites include, for example, The Sixth Sense, Avatar, Beetlejuice, Interview With The Vampire, Independence Day, The Titanic, Ghost, and What Dreams May Come... just to name a few. Those are movies that draw you in, unlike the depth-less, CGI chase scene that is Jupiter Ascending.",Jupiter Ascending
298,tangojazz,"This movie ""Jupiter Ascending"" was rushed through and underdeveloped",1,8 February 2015,"Well, what can I say? If we were to judge a movie strictly on ""ideas"" and cinematography, ""Jupiter Ascending"" would get a ""10"" (out of ten). But, we, or I, judge a movie on the whole ""results"". J.A. fails miserably on the ""results"". First, the good (what little there is of it). The first 20 to 30 minutes of J.A. beats any version of David Lynch's movie ""Dune"" hands down, all the way. Unfortunately, it's the last 1 hour, 30 minutes of J.A. that sinks it into the bowels of the earth. Now, the bad. The movie came off listless and flat, like it was rushed through production without a thought (and probably was). Mila Kunis was absolutely the wrong actress for her part. Mila looked like she was sleepwalking her way through the movie. Any other actress (Sienna Miller, Jennifer Lawrence) would have brought life to the part. Channing Tatum played a good soldier, but he needed to speak up, because I couldn't hear what he was saying sometimes. Sean Bean also looked like he was ""phoning in"" his part, and also had trouble speaking, basically mumbling his words. The story was overly complicated, and needed to be simplified. I couldn't tell what was this and that on the screen half the time. There was a lack of suspense in the story, and no sense of humor. Overall, I got the feeling that ""Jupiter Ascending"" was really saying the message ""I don't care, I don't care"" over and over again. well, I don't care either.",Jupiter Ascending
299,passan-80670,My head hurts,4,10 October 2020,"What even happened? I swear I payed attention...I highly recommend this movie if you like to have a headache.
Not because it is complex, but because nothing makes sense.The worlds they introduce have more in common with Harry Potter than SciFi.
Even the music reminds me of it.
There were 4 first acts, 3 second acts and 2(?) three acts? The prolong is ridiculous and the epilogue is... extremely lame.I feel like this movie would be a really cool trilogy. But sadly is is one giant incomprehensible product.",Jupiter Ascending
300,PadmeAgnes,Visual Splendor with Shallow Characters,6,8 February 2015,"This movies carries too much Dune, Star Wars, Cinderella, Constantine ... and even Astrix&Obelix. It could have been a great story. Any focus would have helped. They have: 3 ""heirs-sibling""issue, a ""parent-child"" issue, a true love story and self-overcome struggle. Trying to cover everyone/every bit, they did nothing well. The characters are thin as a piece of paper. Honestly Mila Kunis depicted as this ... nobody believes that. The Scene production is fantastic despite I see too much other SF it. That makes it good fun but unfortunately the music did everything as it should and hence did not surprise. The Gowns and costumes are beautiful, a plus. One point: Eddie Redmayne is one of my fav bad-dark-side characters from now on. Good fun but don't expect something extraordinary",Jupiter Ascending
301,Hopstimop,Poor script good action,6,14 February 2015,"The Wachowskis better hire a real script writer before they even start to think about a new movie.Jupiter Ascending had many cool ideas and technical gadgets and it looked amazing in 3D, but:1. Characters are flat and boring and do not develop 2. Too many characters -> no time for character development 3. Acting is sub standard and sometimes overacted 4. Uninteresting and confusing political intrigues, which nobody cares for 5. Confusing goals of characters 6. Confusing and irrational actions and reactions of characters 7. Things happen without reason out of the blue 8. Plot devices everywhere 9. Unfinished plots 10 Clichés en masse 11. Absolutely no tension nor catharsis... and probably many more bad things.For me the worst thing is the lack of tension and catharsis. Absolutely nothing is there which would create any emotion in me as a viewer. Not only the characters do not get any symphaty out of me (maybe Sean Bean a little bit), but there isn't even a trace of a sign hinting that the writers tried to get a ""yesss"" out of me. The ending is illogical and flat on emotions, like the whole movie before. I think, this movie wins the grand prize on the most boring and uninteresting death of a bad guy.------------SPOILER--------------Come on! You live on Earth as a poor cleaning lady. You see corrupt politicians, starving children and sick people all around.You learn to know that you are the sole owner of Earth. You are apparently concerned enough for 7 billion people to fight for their lives, but then you decide to continue working as a cleaning lady and in your spare time you surf with anti-gravity shoes on, between skyscrapers, instead of landing on earth with a huge spaceship declaring your ownership, throwing out the corrupt politicians and finishing wars and world hunger and you don't even bring that cool wound healing spray to human kind.Right...You are either a very dumb person or a real a**.",Jupiter Ascending
302,eichler2,Spectacularly Awful,1,17 August 2015,"Take the worst elements of every bad sci-fi epic you've ever seen - Flash Gordon, Dune, Phantom Menace, etc - and throw 'em in a blender. Add a ton of CGI, explosions and fighting scenes. And just for good measure, make the hero a space rollerblader who's supposed to be part wolf but for some reason used to have wings that he wants back or something. Make sure half the characters mumble their lines so the audience can't figure out that the plot makes no sense. Grind it all up and half-bake for two hours and you've got Jupiter Ascending.I love a good sci-fi movie, and from the previews I was hoping this would be one...but it's not. It's really, really, really not. I'm glad I didn't waste the time and money to go see it in a theater, but even a buck fifty to rent it seems like a rip-off. After 20 minutes, I had completely lost interest in the movie. After an hour, I gave up and went to bed. The next morning I forced myself to watch the rest of the movie before returning it, but I would have been better off just letting it go. It's really that terrible. The fact that it currently has a 5.5 average on IMDb is a crime - this shiny turd doesn't deserve better than a 2 or 3. Avoid.",Jupiter Ascending

I quite enjoyed the first half. It has the novelty of storyline that we are not native to earth and that there are vast species etc. I really liked the bureaucracy part. But thereafter the movie got worse and worse almost like rushing to the end without thought, without acting, without emotions, without class. Someone here wrote that the movie is like written by a 10 year old on drugs, for the second half of the movie i can totally understand that.CGI-characters of the movie was shitty, and the hero with no particular superpower blasted through entire machine-armies without much effort. Movies like that are a waste of time. Also the fast that humans were harvested for lipo(=fat)what??? As a PhD in molecular biology i find this truly horrid. Really. There isn't any substance from humans that cant easily be harvested from cloning. And this is todays technology. Also the movie is so predictable that you can foresee the whole movie by watching the front picture, and i have grown to hate predictable movies, especially with overuse of CGI.

Even Uwe Boll's worst movie is better than this.I am still at a loss as to why this movie can be this awful, as Wachowski brother's ""Cloud Atlas"" is one of the best movie of the decade and many of the cast in Cloud Atlas joined cast in this movie.

305,vincent-malisse,Jupiter Descending,2,12 February 2015,"There are many, many things happening in this movie. None of it makes any sense. The story is lame and has more holes in it than the Swiss cheese between my sandwich. First you have the character situations. Jupiter is from Russian descent, yet there is no reason for that fact further in the story. For all I care she could be American, French or Japanese. Her mother is a cleaning lady, with a degree in Mathematics ?! No way. And then she (Jupiter) just accepts everything in this movie: being a royalty, flying with boots, interstellar travel, several attempted murders, ... without any emotional or rational difficulties. We also have no clue how long this ordeal took. It could be hours, days, weeks. Take your best guess.Wise and Apini are some sort of elite soldiers; I think, because there is no background information on this whatsoever and there is no clue on what drives them. And lastly we have the Abrasax family which throughout the story puzzle me on what they want exactly and why. They explain this, but not to my satisfaction. There is no information given on the vastness of their wealth, nor on that of any other family that they claim exist. The universe they live in has no details at all. They say the name of some world or planet, slap some fancy cgi on the screen and call it a story, but the used technologies in the movie have to be accepted by the viewer without question and any overview on how far evolved the universe is completely absent.The scene of the administrative difficulties is perhaps the funniest part of the movie, but it is also the most outplaced and fits the story as much as a 'flying prickly pear spaceship' doesn't.If we come down to acting, for anything, it makes everything even worse as it is, plain and simple, the acting is so bad that my cat could give a better performance while sleeping on the sofa. You even wonder if they got paid for this.The last thing to talk about. Special Fx, cgi. Granted many of the effects where nice. But there are a lot of effects. In fact I'm guessing they shot the entire thing in front of the green screen. And unfortunately you do see the difference between a real scene and cgi effects and by using so much of it, it becomes very annoying to look at.February 2015 and we have a candidate for worst movie of the year.",Jupiter Ascending
306,martin-807-452270,"Awful, awful awful.",1,19 February 2015,"This film is bad. You'd think after the total disaster of John Carter (on Mars) someone somewhere would learn that if you take sci-fi and just throw millions and millions and millions of dollars at it is will just be rubbish. And by god is this rubbish. (It's worse than that Jim, It's s, h, i and t). This film is so bad I just don't know where to start. Hang on - I'm going to have a cup of tea and a think. OK. It has no redeeming qualities at all. The film, not the tea, The story is so badly written that I was just sighing to myself every five minutes. It basically goes like this: Large bit of exposition explaining what they are going to do next then they go and do what they were saying there were going to do in a huge amount of silly CGI. We have seen so many action scenes that we all know anything can be done, but we need to have a vested interest in at least one of the characters to give a damn whether they live or die, and in this whole movie I couldn't care less if everyone died. The tone of the film is perplexing. In the first few minutes this bloke is shot dead for no reason. Then the main character is born at sea under a particular constellation pertaining to something to do with astrology, but this is never mentioned again. Then there is a woman in her knickers and bra for some reason. Don't know why. Then Jupiter Jones leaves the earth then she's a queen and we are suddenly in Terry Gilliam's Brazil, complete with Central Services and a cameo from TG himself. (Naughty Terry). The Wachowski directors have just stolen from FLASH, DUNE, BRAZIL, 2000AD and any other Sci-Fi source they can find. There is even a 2001 space station in one shot. They have proved over the last four films that they have got nothing left to say at all. The film is so Flash Gordon there is even a forced wedding scene with the hero Flash turning up on a space scooter and crashing in at the right moment, oh sorry he's not Flash, he's – I don't know or care, because I've lost the will to live, because there is no suspense and there is no logic to anything. Then not-Flash rescues not-Dale and we have to go through the whole thing again, but this time Ming, sorry, some bloke I never got the name of - who has got a very sore throat and serious Oedipus issues and played by the unfortunate Eddie Redmayne (I bet he wishes he'd got his BAFTA earlier and not had to endure this pile of steaming llamas plop) needs Not-Dale to put her royal seal on a document so he can own Earth, and she has to abdicate, without doing anything of any use whilst being Queen, how about a few edicts? I'd at least ask to see the Royal Mint and get some coins done we me on them. But no. Not-Dale goes off without even a ray gun to see the baddest man in the universe and right at the last minute not-Flash hurtles in and saves the day on another space scooter thing. (His insurance premiums must be astronomical), And of course because he's broken the window at the top of the factory, the whole place is going to go up. I don't know about you, but if I was going to build some sort of factory in the middle of Jupiter where the atmosphere is incredibly fierce, the gravity is gigantic, the electrical storms are the size of EARTH, I would build some sort of fail safe and make certain that if some twit with a space scooter crashed into my big window the whole place wouldn't disintegrate with the speed of the Titanic hitting a massive iceberg. And the baddie dies falling off a tall thing. OMG!! How many bad guys have to die falling off tall things? At least Ming got a big rocket ship through his guts. If I was a bad guy I'd live in a bungalow.Then some space people who were bad, but then good and then bad who may be friends with Sean Bean do some stuff and are then good people, but then they nip off, but luckily just in time to save Not-Flash and Not-Dale and oh, for Heaven's sake. I don't care I really don't. And then they are back on Earth. Sorry? What? She's the queen of the flipping universe and can do anything and she goes back to cleaning the toilets? Can you IMAGINE how angry her hard working mother would be if she knew her daughter was the heiress to billions and she wasn't doing anything with it? Why the hell do you think she left Russia to go to the USA? In search of a new life! Not to clean toilets! And the Not-Flash bloke has got wings at the end, Oh for sake of Peter Jackson is this Lord of the Rings? He's even got Vulcan Elf ears!! Is there no originality AT ALL in this movie??? Come on!! Couldn't he have had a penis in the middle of his forehead to indicate he was an alien. Oh? He has got one of those? Sorry didn't notice. And they all speak perfect English and apparently the Earth was seeded with genes from, Oh I don't care, I just couldn't care less anymore, this is awful, and I've run out of tea. And there's some big sci-fi Lizards with wings called Mr. flipping Ben or something. SIGH.

307,Drive-in_Zeppelin,"Hey Morpheus, If I take both the red pill and the blue pill will I get my 127 minutes back?",4,6 February 2015,"I would have thought that after the 15+ years since The Matrix that consumers would be less and less dazzled by visual effects in film, but apparently I was the only one to take the red pill and see beyond the illusion of this movie. Sure you'll get otherworldly visuals and some pretty neat future-tech in Jupiter Ascending but that's where the takeaway stops. The story is a classic one where a seemingly insignificant individual, in this case Jupiter Jones (Kunis), is suddenly thrust into a much larger and complicated universe than her day-to-day as a maid. As fate would have it, she happens to be the reincarnation of the matriarch of an extremely powerful dynasty that controls a vast industrial empire in the galaxy. The oldest heir to the mother's inheritance is none other than Oscar-nominee Eddie Redmayne, who for whatever reason has difficulty speaking and doesn't want Jupiter to claim what is rightfully hers. I'll give the Wachowskis that they they've created an incredibly elaborate alternate universe that is equally rich in scope and potential, but they fail to generate the least bit of depth to their characters. Every person you meet is a one-dimensional caricature you'd find in some other sci-fi story.Honestly the scope is too ambitious to warrant any initial investment in Jupiter or any of the other supporting actors like Channing Tatum and Sean Bean. It's literally just 2 hours of zero-tension action sequences and clichéd dialogue that lead to a resolution that the audience couldn't care less about. Sure the tech is pretty cool and I was pleasantly surprised by the design of the ships and planetary locales, but the novelty of seeing Channing Tatum ice-skate around the air fighting aliens that pose little threat wears off after the first scene. It's like watching the Jedi take on the droids in the Star Wars Prequels. Why even bother putting them in the way if they don't pose the slightest inconvenience to our protagonists?I can appreciate science fantasy that dazzles and delights in an original universe, but eventually the tunnel-vision wears off and you realize that there is very little to keep you invested in the story. The planet Jupiter might actually be the most ironic and appropriate metaphor for this movie since - sure it's pretty to look - but then you realize you're just looking a big ball of the two most common gasses in the universe.

Storyline is so simple and predictable. I think the only thing which is a bit awkward is the harvesting of the planets ( which they really did it right now in reality then ) , but for all the other ideas , they are not new or inventive. This movie reminds me of The chronicles of Riddick, a bit of Dune , a bit of the latest Matrix. The acting is rather poor and what's worse is the cutting or mixing of some scenes. The storyline is as said simple, almost Cinderella-kind and by God the good ones always are just in time to rescue Mila . Stopped counting how many times that happened. Then the villain is so pathetic that it made me laugh. The characters so stereotypic that I can't believe that this came from the same guys who gave us The Matrix. And being fare , The Matrix trilogy was also acting with special effects added later, but at least we had good acting. Mila is trying but it's not enough, and the scenes are so short that it is impossible for actors to give what they are supposed to do. Then there is this scene where she had to register. What was that all about ? Nicking Terry Gilliams Brazil ? In the end I can only rate this purely on what's good , the effects, images and dresses.

Occasionally the action scenes can be a little shaky, but nothing to really gripe over. This movie is very original, but most of the original concepts were just Easter eggs or exposition, so they had nothing to really do with the plot. This is really all that is good about the film. Every character is very bland and one- dimensional (with a possible exception for the relationship between Channing Tatum's and Sean Bean's characters). Mila Kunis's character is very boring and emotionless, with her most emotional scenes involves her saying ""Holy crap"" calmly. The Russian family was unbearably difficult to watch. Much of this film is awkward and too cheesy. The romantic dialogue is laughably terrible. Many of the character designs for the aliens are also way too silly. The humor does not fit very well. While the comedic scenes are funny, in the context of the movie they just do not fit. The movie took a five minute break to tell a joke about bureaucratic processes.

Spaceship design that is not novel per-se but surely well done and many dystopian scenes a-la Reddick with a scene I can remember and could have stayed in our mind for a long time (an entrance in the mother ship bordered with impressive statue and epic costume).The problem is the usual short-comings for the movie genre (and productions that think that throw effects and money, and the audience will respond positively)- it follows the usual recipe: you start with a good idea and a promising story, add great effects ... but use actors who recite their text instead of empathizing with the role, then you add a pinch of scenes making little sense (flying bees because ""they know royalty"") that makes the audience feel their intelligence is being insulted. You end with no subtleties, a predictable development and overall, one dimensional and under-developed characters for what could have become a space odyssey and franchise. It comes flat of exploiting gold-mines such as the main protector character spliced with wolf DNA or turn the attraction (cliche yet could have worked) story into a pre-teenage girl out of control and over-obvious. who directed this should be removed form business - the actors should have thought twice before working under such a director (Channing Tatum had good roles and so did Mila - what happened??).I still give 4 because I can remember some of the movie besides the nausea ... but as a conclusion - what a waste of talent and potential!",Jupiter Ascending

314,isabelle-frater,Looks beautiful,5,7 February 2015,"This movie reminds me of one of my favourite sci-fi movies of all time, The Fifth Element. Mostly, because when I saw it, I thought it was one of the most gorgeously shot movies I've ever seen. This was the same way. I keep remembering pictures from it, environments that I kind of wanted to melt into, and be in that scene. The space ships were majestic. The dresses that Jupiter wore, I want all of them. They were intricate, beautiful, and sleek. Kym Barrett is a goddess.The concept of the world I liked. It was intricate, and well- thought-out. The way they meddled with genes and technology gave it a good variety, and also a great range to play with. Without spoiling the story, the Earth origin story was believable, and it gave a good explanation to what we saw.The story itself was good. There were some humorous moments, like the bureaucracy. There wasn't much of a twist, the ""mystery"" element was quite obvious after the first about 30 minutes. The action was fast-paced, however, and looked great. The romance aspect was very minor, and a bit forced. It was obviously coming, but it didn't seem to actually play a role in the events, or in how the characters interacted with each other. If they had just been friends, I don't think it would have made much of a difference. Note to film-makers, there doesn't have to be a romantic aspect in every story.The casting was also good. Mila did a great job as Jupiter. She was as confused about everything as can be expected, but at the end could harden her face and kick some ass. Channing is starting to be a bit overused as the resident muscled love interest. Not that he's not hot, or that he didn't growl appropriately, but I'm starting to feel bad for every other muscular male actor out there. I did feel, however, that his role was rather generic, and repetitive.So the movie itself didn't blow me away in its complexity, just the pictures did. However, it is a fun sci-fi movie, and I would love to have a sequel, or even just books, because I want to know what happens to Jupiter in the future.",Jupiter Ascending
315,Yelitza-screenwriting-student,Dazzling Entertaining but Undramatic Planetary Ride,6,5 February 2015,"This is an enjoyable film, but it lacks drama. I've changed my review a couple of times--perhaps I should re-watch this film in 3-D to be more accurate in my assessment!In terms of comparison, if I use ""Star Trek into Darkness"" as my measuring standard, ""Jupiter Ascending"" fails. Jupiter Ascending surely is an imaginative space adventure that incites a sense of wonder, a sense of new possibilities. It has great special effects and dazzling battles, great alien-humanoids and grandiose planetary cities, and a peculiar human-genetic-material thirsty family-dynasty. The idea about harvesting genes to keep immortality is creative, but the writers could have infused more dramatic scenes and more depth to the story. In fact, twenty minutes after leaving the theater, I had the aftertaste of an overloaded video-game with lots of spectacular computer graphics and lots of acrobatics in the form of flying and tumbling and leaping and flipping and skateboarding in the air; and in top of that, a fading memory of inanimate faces--except for Eddie Redmayne's. Most characters are expressionless. Hence, the weak emotional core of the film.Regarding the characters, my favorite is Balem Abrasax (Eddie Redmayne). Eddie exudes an eerie softness and sophistication--he keeps you in suspense. In turn, Titus Abrasax is excessively dull (Douglas Booth's performance is completely the opposite of his super-charged role in NOAH). Jupiter Jones (Mila Kunis) seems neutral, unengaged with the alienesque worlds around her. Caine Wise (Tatum Channing), he limits himself to being a static silent-and-serious protector. A slight-hint of heart appears in the relationship between Jupiter Jones (Mila Kunis) and her crazy family. But the romance? Caine Wise (Channing Tatum) and Jupiter Jones didn't feel romantic whatsoever. No spark. Nothing like Sarah Connor and Kyle (Terminator) or Peter Parker and Gwen (Spiderman). In general, I found the plot and its plot points predictable. No surprises. Cause and effect. Straightforward. An unimpressed Jupiter Jones is dragged around from one world to another, where ""her majesty"" is blackmailed. Interesting details: I liked Caine Wise's rocket-anti-gravity-boots. Jupiter Jones' spectacular wardrobe and hairstyles. And the superb reptilian-bipeds! The planets and the castles and the spaceships were also beautiful.Overall, Jupiter Ascending is entertaining, a little silly, but not that exciting or memorable. However, it's worthwhile watching once. Enjoy the planetary and Earthly-skies ride!Thanks for reading. Cheers.",Jupiter Ascending
316,ian959,"Awful, story and substance lacking film",4,10 July 2015,I have never understood the praise for the Wachowski brothers and their films. Speed Racer was diabolical and The Matrix one the biggest pieces of horse manure I have ever seen. Visually great but lacking enormously in every other way.I did not know this was a Wachowski Brothers film until after I had watched the movie. It explains so much...Even as I watched the film I kept on thinking WTF... the story line was barely there and what little there was was so utterly confusing. It was like the brothers had grabbed their favorite 10 seconds from 200 sci-fi/action films and edited it together in some random way expecting it to make some sense. It didn't.Couple that with some fairly dire acting and this just descended into a turgid mess from which there was no hope of recovery.Visually of course there is no problem but that simply highlights everything that is wrong with this film and indeed a vast chunk of the depressingly formulaic output from Hollywood nowadays. Impressive CGI does NOT a film make...Honestly this was the worst two cinematic hours of my life for a long long time. It is easy to see why this tanked big time at the box office. Hopefully the Hollywood studios will start to realise sometime soon that to make a decent film you need to start with a good story. This didn't. There is nothing here that could induce me to recommend the film in anyway other than the impressive visuals.,Jupiter Ascending
317,wewilsons,I said WOW more times than any movie before,9,8 September 2015,"The critics leave out one very critical piece of information. To have fit so much story and so much action with so much new and amazing effects in so short a time is just short of miraculous.To fit so much story it is a VERY fast moving plot. If you can't absorb complex plots quickly, you won't be able to keep up. To move from simple earth girl to universe royalty in 127 minutes is a huge undertaking and it was well done. When I read it was over two hours thinking it was only 90 minutes tells you how fast this movie goes by. Its an amazing ride!The action is immense with breathtaking scenes just as ridiculous and unbelievable as the best Avengers, Matrix and Batman can come up with.Difference is the immensely advanced effects.This movie moved the computer effects scale up several notches over anything I have seen and integrates those effects so matter of factly as to leave you in awe. I am still reeling at how much artwork went into this film. You become so used to the barrage of amazing vistas and generated imagery that you have to focus on the characters to keep from missing the story. Simply have to see this a few more times to get more of the awesome work done in this film. The break from the licensing sequence was fun and funny. The makeup and proppery of the alien characters and devices throughout is phenomenal.The cost of packing so much into so short a venue is in the number of characters. There are fewer characters than a slow movie would have and the story is rushed to fit in a 127 minute film!! A sacrifice I am willing to take. Channing did an amazing job of legionnaire and While Mila's character is too casual about adapting to the universe she is always a lovely fun and absorbing actress!!Huge plot holes in a 127 minute film that could have been 4 hours, gave it 9 of 10, but JA sets the bar for explosive fantasy sci fi films of this era. Wuchowski's skills are developing way past Matrix. Watch these guys, they have a monstrous future. Thanks for the amazing film Gentlemen!! WAHOOOO !!",Jupiter Ascending
318,AStormOfSwords13,Very fun thrill ride worth viewing underneath a flawed plot,8,5 February 2015,"For months I have looked forward to the film. With such grim prospects in terms of the box office, it was a film I was waiting for. Now the wait is over! Jupiter Ascending is here and its bang is here to bring some fun into the year of 2015!It was a thoroughly fun and adventurous film. Of course, the plot of the film was a bit jumbled, and at times I didn't know what was going on. So much went on throughout the movie that it might have been a better idea to make it into more than one film to explain it better. The number of villains was too much to keep track of the film and it had a few clichés thrown in there.However, this is where my gripes for Jupiter Ascending end. The secret to enjoying the film is to look past the mess of a plot and find its treasures, and boy does this film have them! Let's start with the special effects. They are top-notch. The release date was pushed back to finish these special effects, so when I saw the end result, I was in awe at how stunning they were. It was definitely well worth the wait.Next, Mila Kunis, Channing Tatum, and Sean Bean, who were Jupiter Jones, Cain Wise, and Stinger respectively. Jupiter Jones starts out as a seemingly ordinary girl, cleaning toilets for a living. But as the movie goes on, we see more to her than that Plain Jane life she's had. She turns out to be royalty throughout the universe. It might seem clichéd, but it also makes her that much more believable as a protagonist and Mila Kunis served the role of Jupiter well. Then there's Cain, a fallen hunter who's needed to track Jupiter down to earn back his wings and find where he belongs in the universe. He too is a dynamic character, especially as he falls in love with Jupiter. His obstacles are some of the most over-the-top he has to overcome, but I was left rooting for him throughout. And Sean Bean as Stinger was a nice touch to the film as well. His character isn't developed as much as Jupiter and Cain, but he was still fun to watch all the same.Third, the action in the film. It is breathtakingly fun and it left me at the edge of my seat! It takes time to get there, but once it starts, be prepared for a thrill ride that won't let go. My eyes were hooked onto the screen, excited for whatever zany yet thrilling scene or fight happened next.The soundtrack was well-done as well. Sure, it isn't as Steve Jablonsky or Hans Zimmer, but it is good enough to go with the stunning special effects and thrill ride action, so it makes for a great movie despite any confusion from the plot.Finally, while I had major complaints about the plot, even that had its positives. Life can be a repetition of everyday work and it can truly be a struggle, which the movie showed with Jupiter's life before it changed forever, helping Jupiter to be a believable character as a whole. Connections with the real world were displayed more than once as she and her crew had been given a go-around by the bureaucratic tax people when her identity needed to be verified as royalty, not much different from the real world struggles when we get given the go-around whenever we need to get our work done. It isn't the most original film ever, but it does have that sparkle of something different and nonconformitive to the world of sequels, reboots, and remakes. It's its own thing and I respect the risk behind it. To top it all off, it has a good message. If you spend a long time separated from home, wouldn't that make you appreciate home and your prior life that much more? This film answers this and shows underneath the boringness of the mundane, you really can't beat home once you learn to appreciate it.Overall, this film is worth at least one watch and those who like fun sci-fi action will not regret giving this a go. In fact, it might take a few views to really appreciate it, but still, it is thoroughly enjoying and fun, so I'm glad to have found this film to go see. I might even see this again very soon. Jupiter Ascending? Yes please!",Jupiter Ascending
319,edmundgrieg-80388,Like Star Wars. Visually spectacular. Mostly humorous. Mostly harmless and shallow.,7,11 March 2017,"Plenty of stuff to keep my eyes busy. Ridiculous aliens out of nowhere or androids or whatever doing things that are 'funny'. Story is as light as a puddle, like an easy-going ride. Visually stunning space stuff. Minimal real character development or drama, a sequence of faintly amusing space-y fun things.This is like Star Wars. But I like this better. Less pretension. Or baggage. Better special effects. Actually, funnily enough, also a more convincing and well developed plot. It's about finding resources, not blowing up whatever Death Star it is this time. Sorry if that sentence was too long.

320,cinemabon,"Great SFX, followed by cliché after cliché",4,4 June 2015,"Jupiter Ascending – directed by Andy and Lana WachovskiGood science fiction opera has space ships, strange worlds, and a myriad cast of unusual characters; so does ""Jupiter Ascending."" In addition to a strong cast (Channing Tatum, Mila Kunis, Eddie Redmayne and Sean Bean) experienced directors in the genre, and outstanding special effects by Industrial Light and Magic; Jupiter Ascending would appear to have all the elements necessary for a successful run as brilliant science fiction story. The production design by Hugh Bateup (Matrix and Superman) is imaginative and engaging. Photography by Oscar winner John Toll (Braveheart, Legends of the Fall) is the best I've seen in a science fiction movie for at least three years. I did not find the score by Michael Giacchino exceptional although he did win an Oscar for ""Up."" Overall, a talented remarkable crew. Then what happened? Why did this film fail (though commercially, it recouped its budget, success in Hollywood is measured by percentages that exceed twenty percent of gross)?I believe, if you're going to introduce audiences to a new world (as did John Carter) you must think on a scale that replicates the larger-than-life format. George Lucas did. However, one shudders to think if his first film had been a flop. No more Star Wars. No more science fiction. Finances would have dried up. When Star Wars became such a colossal success, it opened the door for a flood of fantasy/science fiction that followed and a genre reborn to a public bored with outer space. Only two sci-fi formats – Star Trek and Star Wars – have captured the public's imagination. While this is a review of Jupiter Ascending (which I enjoyed as a science fiction writer), I find this conundrum puzzling. Why haven't other big budget sci-fi movies achieved the same success?I believe in this instance, the depth of the characters seemed too shallow and very cardboard cutout characters of previous villains, heroes and interested parties. We've seen maniacal galactic emperors (Flash, The Chronicles of Riddick) who get their comeuppance. We've also seen confused princesses who come into their own and end up kicking ass in some throne room. We've seen hard-nosed sidekicks (Han Solo, etc) who come to the lady's defense. One of the film's main premises is that (spoiler) the Earth is a farm from which wealthy galactic citizens derive a serum that prolongs their life (a similar theme in the Matrix where people were farmed as ""batteries""). The other main premise is that everything in the universe boils down to one word – profit (greed is good?). How drool. My mother could have come up with better premise than that! Lastly, does every woman in the universe seem as weak as Mila Kunis does? ""I will do anything if you release my family"" Don't we all know that if you drop that gun, or give in, the villain gets his way and kills everyone anyway, that you lose your bargaining chip? Are we the audience that stupid that we haven't seen this scenario about a million plus times?I believe that when you write science fiction (as I do), you need to come at the material with fresh eyes, be inventive, try not to use clichés or be repetitious, and most of all try to be unpredictable. While my villainous characters in ""Similitude"" (shameless plug) are consumed with wealth and profit, they find delight in exploring other worlds other than just to exploit their resources. Villains can't be imitations of Wall Street barons. You may decry Lucas' space opera as being simple, but you never knew where it was going or who was going to succeed. Success is measured by failures that ultimately result in triumph – not just good over evil, but good ideas over bad ones. Profit as a motive for success cheapens research and study, for pursuit of knowledge is its own reward. I'd give everything I ever knew for five minutes inside Einstein's brain. But I would give spit to know what any billionaire knows – how to make money. That would be the most boring of all. Can they write a symphony, solve a complex equation, or study a subject that reveals an unknown quantity? A script, a story must be inventive. I grow tired of the same canned trash dressed in a fancy gown.George Lucas knew the value of a good story. He continued to surprise us to the end and did so to the strains of John Williams (perhaps one of the key elements to this mystery). Of the three successful fantasy franchises – Lord of the Rings, Star Wars and Star Trek – you also have three very memorable scores by Howard Shore (Oscar), John Williams (Oscar) and Jerry Goldsmith (Oscar). The acting and special effects were standard. The scores were above the ordinary. So, did the score of those movies place them above the rest? Or, was there something else that doomed this production?Jupiter Ascending – like Cloud Atlas before it – is the brainchild of the Wachowski brothers (one sexually changed) who also gave us The Matrix. Like Cloud Atlas, the co-directors bit off more than they could chew. Instead of a great science fiction movie, we get little bits and pieces here and there of greatness with long tracks of minutes filled with nothing worth remembering when we – the audience – walk out the door. No tune stuck in my head. No moment of distinction from which I could point and say, ""Did you see that scene?"" As with ""John Carter"" you have a finely crafted story, told by Hollywood experts fill with banal spaces between tiny bits of brilliance. Any composer would tell you that's a sure fire way to put your audience asleep.",Jupiter Ascending
321,hawksburn,Jupiter Asinine,1,7 April 2015,"Throw in a little Dune for the grand space opera, mix in some refugee military from Skeletors last battle with He-Man, steal liberally from the plots of both Soylent Green and Cinderella then, last but not least, chuck in a couple of unemployed lizard soldiers from Super Mario Brothers. Then throw more money than sense at the entire construct.There, in a nutshell, is Jupiter Ascending.Poor little Russian émigré Chicagoan (yes, she's an ""alien"" who's an alien, not exactly subtle) becomes the target of DNA spliced intergalactic bounty hunters because she shares the exact genetic makeup of a deceased space queen. Yeah I said it, Space Queen. So space queen is rescued by an ex space marine who likes his tummy rubbed and answers to the name of Cujo. OK, he's not that much of a dog but he's a bit of a dog in that he has dog DNA spliced with his human stuff; which was all to make him a better warrior and most excellent when it came to fetching space sticks (and maybe an unfortunate predilection to sniff other space dog warriors butts; but there's always a downside). In this universe everyone seems to be spliced with something; unfortunately this doesn't extend to the film itself which would've benefited from being spliced with an intelligent script.So space dog warrior defends space queen in a hyper-kinetic air battle above Chicago which only serves to remind viewers that the fight choreography in the first Matrix was far superior, even though that film was made 16 years ago by the same filmmakers.Space Queen gets nabbed after meeting with another space warrior who's made of bees or Dyson bag-less vacuum cleaner parts or something, I mean who can tell? She's then taken off to Jupiter (yeah, I know) where she's introduced to the three living children of deceased space queen, who own the Abrasax Corporation and the political machinations as each serves to use her to achieve their own ends. Being a genetic photocopy of the original space queen gives her ownership of The Earth, which is apparently the equivalent of the crown jewels in this known universe. Anyway the others desperately want it (well the brothers anyway). Why all this is so is never explained. It just is, accept it (there's quite a bit of this in this movie). Because it's such a great planet and magical and is coated with pixie stardust or something and no one ever goes hungry, lives in dire poverty or has to be forced to watch The Big Bang Theory. It's Awesome.Of course the thousands of other worlds are basically cattle paddocks for the corporation as the main ingredient for its extremely effective skin care products. Essentially Abrasax is the intergalactic L'Oréal. Because you're worth it.So first time up, humans were D batteries. Now they're a tube of moisturiser.I like Mila Kunis but here she looks as if she's fighting with herself with one half of her psyche uncomfortable with the ridiculousness of the script and the crap that she's forced to say, and her other half thinking about the fat payday. It's interesting that the character she plays expresses nothing more than mild revulsion at the idea of people becoming anti-aging cream. No wrestling with her conscience on behalf of all humanity across the galaxy. I mean she's the space queen after all, gifted with tremendous power of this gigantic corporation that she can rightfully lay claim to. Nope. She's only concerned about the planet she's from, and once she's saved it from ""harvesting"" then she'll jet boot across the Chicago skyline playing ""catch the ball"" with her space dog warrior buddy, willfully ignorant of the horror still supposedly occurring, technically on her behalf given she's still a major shareholder, elsewhere in the cosmos.Channing Tatum spends an entire lengthy sequence in the movie gratuitously shirtless, shooting space lasers in his space jet- boots. Why this shirtlessness is so is never explained. It just is, accept it. And yeah as I mentioned earlier, he wears jet-boots, which factor in quite a bit throughout the film. I remain to be convinced by his acting ability. He still appears to only be able to display an emotional range of a French baguette. I'll give him credit however; he looks as bored and as stupefied by the script as Kunis does. Or he could've been emoting. It's hard to tell.The worst crime of this movie, other than the entire concept, is that you don't care about a single character. Part of this is because you can't be engaged by characters that the actors themselves aren't engaged with. This dissociation then spreads to disengagement with the action, which turns those sequences into purely technical exercises that possibly only Michael Bay would find entertaining.The Waschowskis biggest problem is that they made The Matrix; an excellent film which has cast a huge shadow over everything they've done since in their careers, and will probably carry on with the same effect for the rest of it. They'd only made one significant film prior to that in the form of Bound, a riveting Sapphic neo-noir that garnered the twins' effusive notice. Post 1999 it's been about dealing with that baggage with mixed to middling results. Despite trying to take their stories in different tangents (other than the atrocious Matrix sequels) in an attempt to not retread the same ground, nothing has really worked. The Matrix has economy; it tells its story and remains on point. Their collective work since tends to meander, being both overlong and overblown . However Jupiter Ascending is little more than a bad half-baked concept that makes little sense and steals liberally from better tales. They should probably swap sob stories with M.Night Shymalan.",Jupiter Ascending

I don't know enough about film to offer a diagnosis, but it feels like pacing. Somehow the plot progresses with a languid pace which isn't really the right move for an action-oriented film. The characters don't really develop. The jokes fall flat. The romance isn't very convincing. Bad writing? Bad editing?

324,sandiglendinning,Beauty and the Beast...in space...with Sean Bean.,4,12 May 2015,"Jupiter is a ""normal"" woman with a sad life full of drudgery and cleaning many toilets when some space- people suddenly abduct her.She finds out she's some sort of space-queen who owns Earth. Who can save her from a family of space- perverts bent on killing all the Earthlings on her planet? only a half dog space- guy on space- skates...um...and Sean Bean. This could be a pretty okay plot on the face of things, were it not hindered by dialogue so depressingly bad that it's very difficult to see past how embarrassingly miserable it is. Luckily this film is very visually beautiful and clearly technically accomplished. However the beautiful spacescapes and action sequences are erratically punctuated by awkward exposition and an appalling script. Eddie Redmayne delivers a truly halfassed and mediocre performance- setting his space villain up to be a boring antagonist. It also doesn't help that the two leads have absolutely no chemistry between them so the romance aspect of the story sort of fizzles out halfway through for that reason.There are some interesting themes if you do manage to look beyond the horrible script. The villains are basically intergalactic capitalists sustaining themselves on the backs of the vulnerable. It could be compared to globalisation. Genetics and genetic determinism is also in the mix, but not a great deal of thought is directed into these deeper thematic elements. Nor are they simply presented in an ambiguous or metaphoric way as was the case in The Matrix. These are plot elements which could have been complex and subtle but they're delivered with a blunt instrument then summarily neglected for the rest of the film by the directors which is a real shame.I'm not sure who this movie is going to entertain, on one hand it's chock full of stuff kids love...cool lizard guys, space ships...space fights...on the other, it's totally inappropriate for kids and the plot and pacing are just wrong for younger audiences. There isn't enough substance for the majority of older viewers, the plot lacks a sense of real threat or menace- performances are not especially engaging although Jupiter herself is likable enough and the film is visually stunning it's not enough to give a movie enough steam to sustain it for 2 hours.

It's a very fun and neat science fiction space adventure with a bit of romance and comedy. The story and concept, while similar to other sci-fi movies, are quite unique and creative. It blends science fiction with fantasy which is neat. It also has a bit of a fairy tale vibe which is nice.The visuals are stunning and stylistic and the action sequences were intense. I really liked the environment and the alien creatures were cool. The characters are interesting and I like the chemistry between Caine and Jupiter. I am not a Channing Tatum fan but I thought he was good in this. I also like Sean Bean's performance.There were a couple things that bugged me. One of them is the plot. While the storyline is interesting and thought out, I felt it had a few too many holes and it seemed all over the place. Another thing is the acting. While, the acting isn't the worst I've seen in a movie, I think it could have been improved. I like Mila Kunis but I think her performance seemed a bit wooden. Also, I think Eddie Redmayne tried a bit too hard with his performance as the villain.Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed the film. It's not quite ""Blade Runner"" or ""The Matrix"" or even ""The Fifth Element"", but it's a very good sci-fi flick, and it's worth seeing on the big screen, though, it probably will not be in the theater much longer.

Too much weird stuff happening without good explanations.Some of the scifi stuff, like the lizards with wings were too much. They were just there to be cannon fodder for our soulless hero. The filmmakers probably tried to add tension, since a big hulking lizard is a tougher opponent than just normal human right? Wrong. None of the action scenes had any emotional charge or excitement what so ever. Thanks to our lifeless characters, who are basically invulnerable.The acting was pretty bad for the most part. Eddie Redmayne, who certainly can act, was absolutely terrible. Maybe he was told to use an annoyingly slow and silent voice, but nonetheless his performance was painful to watch. And the other two Abrasax siblings were just as bad. Mila Kunis was quite annoying, starting right from the opening narration. She did get better towards the end though. Channing Tatum wasn't that good either.Only glimmer of hope was Sean Bean. The exposition via Sean Bean's character about 45 minutes into the movie, was the only time when I was even remotely interested in the story.Soundtrack was pretty much nonexistent. Nothing to remember.The movie is filled with special effects. They were extravagant I'll give them that, but they were not good. There were just so much stuff happening during every action scene and it was just so, well, messy. The hovercraft chase scene was absolutely ridiculous. Random CGI things exploding without context doesn't equal excitement. Sometimes less is more.",Jupiter Ascending

The villains, especially Redmayne's character, were so much fun to hate. I had no trouble understanding his breathy voice, although I expected I would.I appreciated the chemistry between Channing and Mila. I especially liked Channing's stand-offishness; his character, although reticent and action-based, had some interesting elements, apparently based on his spliced DNA (wolf-like elements). His continual rescuing of Jupiter showed definite wolf-like determination. Although there could have been more character development, both Jupiter's and Caine's characters did change over the film and it was fascinating watching the nuances. Sean Bean's character added believability, oddly enough.The basic premise of the film, that earth was being prepared for harvesting of the time and lives of its inhabitants, was different and interesting.It is worth watching a second time just for the gadgets and gizmos (loved the gravity boots), and the incredibly complex, lavish settings. There were a few too many explosions for me, but that should not be a drawback for most science fiction fans. The Wachowskis have excelled themselves in world building yet again.",Jupiter Ascending

Sad-wise it's shown 4 damn times. Just the settings are changing.

It's good but not as great as it could of been with a slightly easier to follow script that explained itself at the start so you didn't spend the entire film thinking "" I wonder what's going on "" or "" So that's what's going on "".

339,dmhughes-448-695102,"Jupiter Ascending Is A Modern Version Of Dune, For Better And For Worse",7,6 February 2015,"If there is one pair of directors who make films that I will always see no matter how good or bad they could possibly get, it would have to be the duo of Andy and Lana Wachowski. Ever since I first saw The Matrix (1999) when I was a kid, I have been fascinated with their films. In most cases, the Wachowskis have created films with interesting worlds and stories, breathtaking special effects and costume designs, beautiful music, intriguing (and sometimes admittedly terrible) acting performances, and an array of thought-provoking (and sometimes a bit pretentious) religious/social/economic/philosophical ideas. For over a decade now, The Wachowskis have attempted to emulate the success that they achieved with The Matrix Trilogy, but despite their ambitious efforts, they have been unable to replicate that success. Speed Racer (2008) was visually intriguing but its story was muddled and confusing; I personally think that while Cloud Atlas (2012) was not as groundbreaking as The Matrix, I still thought it was a fantastic film with a great and thought-provoking story, amazing special effects, and some truly Oscar-worthy performances. Over time these films have been viewed more as cult classics, and in the case of Jupiter Ascending, it appears destined to also join that same category.Unfortunately, The Wachowskis' big-budget endeavors could very well come to a quick and painful close with the long-delayed release of Jupiter Ascending, a film that carries with it, for better and for worse, all the previously mentioned hallmarks of a Wachowski film, and as of this writing has been savaged by critics and appears to be another huge box-office flop in the making, which is a shame because despite its problems, I will say that Jupiter Ascending is without a doubt one of the most intriguing films I've seen in a long time, and I have to agree with some critics who are calling it a modern version of Dune (1984). The visuals, music, and world-building are incredible, but like Dune, the story is nothing short of a train wreck, and the acting is either really good or truly weird and a bit awful. Despite this, I still think Jupiter Ascending is an ambitious, though imperfect work of science fiction. When I mentioned that the story is a mess, that's because it is, but I will try to give a quick and spoiler-free synopsis. Jupiter Jones (Mila Kunis) is a Russian immigrant and janitor living in Chicago, who believes her life is going nowhere. In reality, it turns out that her genes are an exact match of those of a deceased intergalactic royal leader, which makes Jupiter the rightful heir to the ownership of the planet Earth. Jupiter is then rescued from alien assassins by Caine (Channing Tatum) and Stinger (Sean Bean), two genetically spliced animal-human hybrids and former intergalactic soldiers. Throughout the rest of the film, Jupiter learns more about the Abrasax family, whose three principal heirs, Balem (Eddie Redmayne), Titus (Douglas Booth), and Kalique (Tuppence Middleton) all have have their own ulterior motives for trying to eliminate Jupiter and take the possession of Earth for themselves. It's up to Caine and Stinger to protect Jupiter from these devious villains, and to help Jupiter accomplish her destiny to become a true intergalactic ruler.Now that plot sounds almost Star Wars or Edgar Rice Burroughs levels of simplistic, but in true fashion, the Wachowskis manage to make the plot incredibly convoluted. In almost every scene, Caine, Stinger, or the Abrasax siblings deliver incredibly complex exposition in an attempt to tell Jupiter (and the audience) about how humanity has existed for billions of years, Earth was created just so its population could be harvested in the name of intergalactic wealth, and countless discussions of destiny and talks of genetics that would make Charles Darwin proud. It almost feels like Jupiter Ascending should have had books or graphic novels released alongside it's cinematic release. The world the Wachowskis have built is grand and epic, but too confusing to navigate properly.Whenever this ""intellectual"" dialog is being delivered, many of the actors talk in ways that are actually funny rather than being serious, much like David Lynch's adaptation of Dune before it. Eddie Redmayne is unintentionally hilarious as Balem; most of the time he speaks in an almost inaudible whisper, and then will scream at the top of his lungs for no reason. It's really bizarre, and could very well earn him a Razzie nomination next year. Jupiter and Caine occasionally have romantic dialog that is cringe worthy, and while they are both good in their roles, they have no chemistry with one another.In the end, Jupiter Ascending is all about style over substance, and the style of this film, much like Dune, is meticulous and jaw-droppingly beautiful. The action sequences are intense and exciting, the costumes and makeup effects are top-notch, and Michael Giancchino's gorgeous soundtrack is almost as good as that of Cloud Atlas. The effects used for the environments and creatures are incredible; it truly proves that what the Wachowskis lack in storytelling, they make up for it with a unique visual experience that should at least get some Oscar nominations for makeup, effects, sound design, and costumes. Jupiter Ascending is almost destined to bomb at the box office and be hated by critics. The movie simply relies too much on its style and visuals, but for once I didn't care that the story and dialog was terrible. Ultimately, this is a visual experience, and as far as I'm concerned, the Wachowskis are still the masters of creating immersive worlds and groundbreaking special effects. Jupiter Ascending, like Dune 30 years ago, is a mess, but it's a beautiful and glorious one, and it still succeeded because it kept me intrigued all the way till the end of the credits, which is what is was destined to do.Final Verdict: 7/10",Jupiter Ascending
340,quasides,Why just why?,3,20 April 2015,"This Movie is a perfect mirror for Hollywood these days.They replace Acting and scripting with CGI. They would rather waste Millions and Millions in special effects instead of doing an actual good story.This movie got so much going on that it became just boring. The hole story is a senseless plot of nonsense, with a few really funny ideas in the middle and .... thats it.And we are not talking about scientific accuracy, no this movie is more fantasy than scifi anyway. Its just nothing made any sense, not the base story, not the characters, not even the harvesting, no really nothing add up, hell it doesn't even connect the parts of the story to each other very well.The acting is mediocre at best. The CGI is well made but way to much. instead of interesting space battles you get overwhelmed with so much that its just plain boring and you might just fall asleep. Nope iam sorry but this fantasy crap is just mindless, soulless waste of a lot of money and even worse waste of audiences time. they rally should pay peoples time back plus interest.its getting a 3 for good technical aspect but mainly because there's still worse out there and if you cant sleep well just play the action sequences in a loop",Jupiter Ascending
341,ClintWardley1,Pretty film but average,7,12 July 2015,"It is hard to pinpoint exactly why this movie at the end feels _ _ _ .The movie is visually beautiful. The back story is very deep and as some others have written very topical. Big uncaring corporations against the message, people matter. The cast adequate, the main story was by the numbers.Girl in danger, hero to protect her, bad guy never gets the upper hand, girl and hero fall in love, happy ever after.Well its Sleeping Beauty, the Disney Version not the atrocious Maleficent.If you check out the score of movies high on effects, Transformers, GI Joe etc, they actually score the same. Yet this actually was better than those by the numbers actioners.So what is wrong? Well I watch the extra's on the Bluray and one of the reasons maybe that Lana Wachowski was too close to the subject matter. She was so in love with the project she failed to see they were making an average film, it may have been better to have the movie edited by someone else.Another reason, I think was the selection of 2 of the cast.Mila Kunis? Really they need someone with more of a screen presence and dare I say it, real experience with comic delivery. The character needed to be world wise, gutsy and funny. Mila / Jupiter just accepted the situation. The character would have been better if the audience actually liked her.Eddie Redmayne??? What the frack was up with that. Did he know he was up for an Oscar so on set he had the power to do his character HIS way or was he pushed into the silly performance. It was only at the end did his character have any balls, the rest of the time he was this effeminate soft spoken boy. Soft spoken? A couple of times I was waiting for his minions to ask him to speak up. There was no violence in his delivery as supposed feared royal.Finally it needed comic relief, maybe a few wisecracks would have helped. They tried it when Jupiter was trying to register as a royal, but the whole thing fell flat. I saw Terminator Gensys on the same weekend, the humour lifted that to be a good movie.They needed to pass the script to Joss Whedon for a humour tune up before filming.In the end it was a pretty film but average.",Jupiter Ascending

Seriouly Wachowskis, I had high esteem for the Matrix, but since then your movies have been going downhill and lacking any originality (Cloud Atlas was another bore).

346,rdjoties,Why?,3,10 May 2015,"This movie is not ""the Matrix"" and it doesn't have to be. This could have been a great popcorn movie. But the biggest problem here is Mila Kunis' performance. In a short period of time her character undergoes irrational changes. Mila Kunis, the actress reacts at these moments as if here favorite perfume is not for sale anymore.We have to believe the characters within the context of a story (these are not my words).Even if the character is underdeveloped or relies heavily on effects. Her character is the backbone of the story. Usually if a character has to convince you what she/he is, the shortcomings of the actor are aided by the fact that he can do extraordinary things, like Keanu Reeves in the Matrix, or Chris Hemsworth in Thor. But Mila Kunis character is not aided by effects or choreography. She has to make a difference with here acting skills. She could not convince me that Earth's faith is in her hands.For instance Gloria Fosters character in Matrix is underdeveloped. She represents something that is just irrational to grasp. But you knew in that instant that she was the Oracle. She has nothing to aid her in the believability of her character, no effects, just cookies. And yet you believe she is something more. She makes you forget the shortcomings in the writing of her character You can say the same of Linda Hamiltons character in ""the Terminator"". For me here performance makes the story believable. You know she is part of something bigger. What if Linda Hamilton's character was played by Mila Kunis, Terminator would be just a movie with a nice concept. Nobody would notice the other characters, because their wouldn't be a connection with the main character. Just like in ""Jupiter ascending"".",Jupiter Ascending

These negative reviews probably come from highly arrogant and pretentious people who falsely think that they have a modicum of intelligence.Movies are meant to make us dream, have a glimpse of the future and what the future could be. In this respect, this movie fulfills this goal perfectly well. It even allows us to ponder on the meaning of life, on the idea of eternal life, and on the concept of time as the most precious commodity in the Universe.The bottom line? If you love science fiction movies such as Star Wars, you will like this movie. You might even want to see it more than once as I did, and each time you will discover new ideas that are part of this movie.There are various elements in this movie that are highly interesting. This idea that ""time"" is the most precious commodity in the Universe and that those who have the means to extend it to a never-ending cycle are those who do have real power in this new Universe that we discover.There is a lot of action, a love story and beautiful and awesome science fiction effects. Yes, the ending could have been much better but is there even a single movie or TV series that could be called ""perfect""? I do not believe that perfection exists and it certainly does not in movies.If you like discovering completely new worlds, you will like discovering the world of the Abrasax dynasty that rule many worlds in the Universe.Conclusion: Do NOT listen to the idiots and the false and vain self-important people who wrote negative reviews, go and watch this movie and enjoy discovering this new world of the Abrasax dynasty and their quest toward eternal life. There are several new ideas in this movie that will make you ponder on life and its meaning.Here are mostly TV series and a few movies that I highly recommend, as I watched them and enjoyed them a lot.--------------------------------------------------------There are a few classics in science-fiction TV series:---Smallville---Star Trek: Enterprise---Babylon 5---Earth: Final Conflict---Battlestar Galactica---Star Wars (6 movies so far and counting)---Jupiter Ascending (a movie)all deserving 15 out of 10 because they are all very special TV series for the quality of their stories and for the amazing actors that they have. Are these TV series perfect? No, as they sometimes have ""filler"" episodes that are not too great and they also sometimes have ""holes"", illogical elements in the main story or in the individual stories of particular episodes. Despite sometimes the presence of these very few shortcomings, these TV series are really unique and special in many ways that you will nevertheless enjoy them greatly.Other TV series that are excellent but not necessarily science-fiction?

I don't know why, probably because a bunch of pretentious folks at Sundance badmouthed it, but this film is going to be trendy to dislike. The movie didn't even come out before people were scoffing at it down their noses. I'm kind of a fan of original sci fi films, and the cast, so I was stoked to check it out. This movie was awesome. I can't even imagine the ridiculous amount of creative work that went into designing such a multi faceted world, complete with interesting technology, styles, creature designs, characters, the works. It was beautiful to look at, and anyone that's a part of the film world should know that not a single pixel, prop, or thread of clothing makes it to set without passing under the eyes of tons of creative minds, so believe me when I tell you more original creative thought went into this movie then you'll have the attention to notice. The conflict is topical, complicated but not hard to follow, has high stakes, and is grounded in the reality of a capitalistic gain. The characters are fun, some will feel very familiar to fans of sci fi/fantasy worlds, and some are very fresh. The performances are great and interesting to watch, the action is extremely well choreographed, the plot is easy to follow, and the film is long enough that we get a full sense of the immensity of the world they created. As it is, in an age where everything that kills the box office is either a remake or based on a book/comic/cartoon, I think it's really cool to see an original sci fi film stand on its own two legs and tell an epic story.

Let's start by the visuals. The visuals are AMAZING and are what makes this movie worth seeing on the big screen. The universe the brothers created is huge,which gives room for a lot of breath-taking scenes. This however, is one of the drawbacks of the film. The fact that the universe is so big and that it is a 2 hour film, makes the story a little sloppy. There are a lot of things left unexplained which is a pity,and too much time filled with love scenes. Moreover,the characters are either good or bad, there's not much depth to them. Despite all this, the movie is good, I decided on 7 instead of 6.5 mainly because of the visuals. You need to consider this movie as a sci-fi flick, taking into account that you don't see many original sci-fi movies around,and that the plot isn't that bad,it's just not mind blowing, I'd encourage you to see it for yourself, grab some popcorn and enjoy the movie for what it is.",Jupiter Ascending

And during this story we will only see a micro part of all this. - Eddie Rayman acting, he made his character feel foreign and alien. He has an aura of power and entitlement like one of the lords of the houses in David Lynch Dune. Cons of the movie Action, the action scenes are like a video game. I noticed that I started to think about other things during the speedy action scenes. Not good at all and probably the worst part of the movie. - Lead actors, Mila Kunis and Channing Tatum aren't particular strong. - Character development, its not was this movie about but some development would be nice.All in all an OK movie but it could have been much better.",Jupiter Ascending

A lot of small rolls and cameos from big stars. And I wish Doona Bae had a larger role, as she stole the show in Cloud Atlas.I can see, why this movie cost 175 million dollars.

He didn't quite sleepwalk through his role like he did in his last few roles, but it was close.

Mila Kunis as the main character is just a flat board. I never believe she is a down-on-her-luck bathroom attendant, she looks too vibrant. And after everything that happens to her she never shows more emotion than a lift of the eyebrow. Usually Channing Tatum is the best thing in a bad movie, because he often gives his all. Not here. Nothing in this movie makes sense, the story is stitched together badly and no one seems to act logical.Visually this movie is oké.

First of all, as a whole, Jupiter Ascending looks like a tremendous feast filled with eye-popping special effects. And to be honest, the Wachowski Brothers once again succeeded on what they are always good at- the visuals. I have no reason to deny how well they managed on the special effects, the Jupiter atmosphere, Channing Tatum and his flying boots, and even the kingdoms, are all a pleasure of watching. But the bad thing is that the story is a total mess. I have no idea what I was watching. It is disorganized which makes every fight scene which supposed to be exciting pointless. Though each scene tend to make the audience intense, by having Mila Kunis make some difficult decisions, then Channing Tatum will definitely pops out to save her. For the first few time, it works. But the same script is used too many times which leads to boredom. There are also some very unbearable lines in the movie that is just ridiculous. Like every movie, Jupiter Ascending will definitely include some romance, but the lines are just so stupid that you keep face- palming. You'll know what I mean after watching it. Some of the actors did great in the movie. I like Sean Bean being the supporting actor; he's just very likable. Tatum and Kunis did okay, but I really hope the movie could develop more on their chemistry if they really mean it. Jupiter Ascending can be passed on if you really miss the chance to watch it.

I would then fall in love with a chivalrous young man who had faced a great danger for me, like dragons, evil sorcerers or highwaymen.I am a grown woman now, but somewhere inside me this little girl is still there. And she loved ""Jupiter Ascending"".This isn't a movie to watch for its philosophical message (even if there is one) or for its social commentary (even if you could find one). This is a movie to watch and be immersed in a whole new world, be amazed by its beautiful landscapes, architecture, costumes, and by its cool gadgets (seriously, who wouldn't want flying boots like Caine's?) and spaceships. This is a film to watch and indulge in your craziest childhood fantasies, like flying, going to another planet, being queen of the universe, you name it, and to be entertained. If this world created by the Wachowskis is so immersive, it's not only because it's well thought and beautifully designed, but also thanks to the cast. In this review, I would like to single out two performances. Mila Kunis plays the lead, Jupiter Jones, an underprivileged girl who dreams of a better life. Kunis, with her good looks, could have seemed fake in this role, but no, she is credible and very relatable (and this is important, since she also is the audience surrogate). One common criticism of the film is that she's too passive. It isn't completely fair. Jupiter isn't an action hero, but an everywoman catapulted in a foreign world, forced to play a game without knowing all the rules. But she learns quickly and grows as a woman throughout the movie. The most unfairly criticized performance from this movie is Eddie Redmayne's, playing the villainous Balem Abrasax. It's true that his performance is over-the-top, but this is because he plays an over- the-top character. Balem is a thousands-years-old power-mad psychopath who combines an unhinged mind with a complete lack of morals, and Redmayne portrays him very well. The rest of the cast is great, too. Every character seems real, even the ones we don't know much about. ""Jupiter Ascending"" also has good moments of humor and knows when not to take itself too seriously. This is all ""make-believe"" after all. The only regret I have towards this movie is that it's standalone. I would have loved to explore more of this universe and its characters in a sequel.",Jupiter Ascending
360,immanuelwilliams1982,Beautiful movie,9,8 February 2015,"Any girl who washes toilets everyday would want to escape from the harsh realities of her life. Like Neo wanted an escape from the life of a programmer and save the matrix. Oh! Neo was not a girl. Although she is as powerful as a queen in the world she discovered, she has to go through the same boring procedures a poor person has to follow in any government office. Even a heaven will be a hell if we don't change. We would find the same misery there as well. The villainous characters are rich and powerful overlords. All involved in the game of making more money or in the case of this movie making more time by feeding of the time of other people. The same political game that we see on earth is being visualized in a world beyond. The people at the top of the pyramid in today's corporate world lives a very opulent lifestyle by buying time from their employees living at the bottom of the pyramid. Are we being a bit judgmental about these corporate giants. Balem definitely had mommy issues. He was almost looking for his mother in a girl that he had found and she just shot him point blank. Lover boys and husbands face this issue in life when they look for their mother in their girlfriend or wife. But then they realize that mom is mom, when they get hurt by the girl they found. Nobody can be mommy. Another thing is people really do love their dogs. There cant be a better friend. Jupiter finds her love in her protector like any girl would. The damsel in distress always needs a rescuer. She would even discover some trouble so that she can feel rescued and safe. All those flavors of life presented in the sci-fi theme is worth a watch. Good movie.",Jupiter Ascending
361,TheTerminatorsky,parody of Russians and Sci-Fi films,6,8 February 2015,"The Russian characters were just a silly parody of perhaps what the Wachowskis seem to think Russians look, talk, and behave like; They looked more Irish or Albanian than Russian. Why make Jupiter Russian at all? Is it to explain Mila Kunis' accent? If so, she seemed to do quiet well in 'That 70's Show' and many movies with no place of birth mentioned. Besides, in the movie Jupiter did not grow up in nor was she even born in Russia, so how did she get the accent?(Mila Kunis was born in Ukraine.)I don't get why the family moved to Chicago instead of NYC. This is not the 19th.c. migrants cant just stow away on a ship, sail across the ocean, and magically live in a house in Chicago. Also, why would a pretty girl like Jupiter be a house cleaner at all? I see her as a waitress in some bar on Brighton Beach.As for the plot, well, it seems to have something to do with some family dispute as to whom gets which planet. One bro vs. 2nd bro and sis, who at first I thought was their mother because of her age. Then, she takes a bath and voila! She is as good as a new born. OK. But, why didn't she do so before Jupiter arrived, instead she chose to wait for her ""mother's"" arrival to show off this trick? Was it to explain(as her bro did) why they need humans?There was some nonsense about DNA coming together to form their dead mother, so therefore her son has to marry her... oh, and then kill her? What a cookoo family. And wasn't the real ""mother"" that rich blonde woman whose name Jupiter gave at the clinic? So, wouldn't the aliens finally realize their mistake and go after blondie? Or am I wrong and Jupiter is indeed the re-incarnated mother alien? Her statue is later shown, so how anyone could mistake her for blondie is strange.Jupiter herself reminded me of Neo from 'The Matrix'; in fact, the movie seemed to be a rip-off of 'The Men in Black', 'Star Wars', 'Star Trek', 'Blade Runner', 'Soylent Green', '5th Element', and ifcourse 'Dune'. Any fans of 'Dune' will recognize the ""house of this"" talk. Genetic splicing of humans and animals is too 'Island of Dr.Mereau' for me. Also, if these aliens created humans, then who created them? Perhaps PartII(if it happens) will explain.At least, there is some explanation as to why the master-race aliens look human(or vice-versa), because the Earth Homo-Sapiens were genetically engineered by them for rejuvenation purposes to harvest organs/DNA, an interesting concept.'Prometheus' too was not well received by critics and most audiences, but it does have its fans; Part II is being made anyway. JA is perhaps on its way to be considered a cult-classic, as is '2001', 'Brazil', 'Cloud Atlas', and 'Blade Runner' which flopped upon release but part II will be made. Now, wouldn't NASA or ISS or the Russians detect some massive ships or craft around Jupiter? And, the explanation that all the damage is rebuilt and everyone just forgets everything is just too 'Men in Black'y for me.The 3D on the big screen was pretty good, some scenes did stand out and make me feel in the middle of it; but I wouldn't say $18.75 was worth it. As for the action, it was too jittery and hard to follow during the Chicago attack. So, let me just say the CGI, set design and costumes were good, but the dialogue, the plot, the characters were just too silly(same could be said of 'Star Wars' ifcourse).",Jupiter Ascending
362,dangent280,The Day My Mind Stood Still,3,12 February 2015,"Oh Wachowski siblings. Your once promising career has all but ended thanks to this latest offering to the people of this much loved Earth. Such an unwelcome gift comes in the form of Jupiter Ascending, a film that can only be described as being this decades' Battlefield Earth, a statement that does not come lightly, whilst being a complete shame when remembering how brilliant The Matrix was when I first watched it. Now, in 2015, instead of The Matrix, we have a film with no soul, no depth, and seemingly not a care in the world, aside from one that has a massive bank note wrapped around it, with its' lead characters being almost as soul-crushingly dull as the film itself. Rant mode activated. I would attempt to give a brief synopsis of Jupiter Ascending, but the truth is, I really cannot be bothered. The plot is so ridiculously uninspiring and sleep-inducing that it's making me yawn even as I think about it now, whilst simultaneously making me cringe so hard, I feel like I am looking at early photos of my dress sense in the 1990's. So plot done with, what's next I hear you ask! Characters. Okay. Firstly, I have a fundamental problem with Mila Kunis as a bog cleaner. It just wouldn't happen. Also, being cursed with a name such as Jupiter Jones, surely she would have legally changed it by now? No sane human being would walk around 21st century society with a name so laughable being called Ben Dover is a step up. Unless that's the actual underlying point of the film, that she is actually so insane that she dreams of meeting a topless, roller skating, wonky eared, Channing Tatum and flying off to badly CGI'd planets, because whoever pitched the idea of Jupiter Ascending was clearly mad and needs to be heavily sedated and sectioned ASAP.As for Channing Tatum, his reputation as a ""serious actor"" has been dealt a crippling blow. Why would he, after doing so well in Foxcatcher, want to be in this turkey of a movie? Surely he must have read the script? The same goes for Sean Bean, who throughout the entirety of his scenes in the film looks as bored as I did watching him, yet acting bored in a movie is better than acting as a humanised wooden plank, a feat which Ms. Kunis passes with flying colours. And now on to Eddie Redmayne. Oh Eddie, Eddie, Eddie. Your Oscar win is not as clear-cut as it might once have been. His portrayal as the villainous I-don't-care-what-his-name-is is exceedingly laughable and can only be described as the dull second- cousin of Gary Oldman's, Zorg, in The Fifth Element. His constant need to quietly whisper instructions to badly designed flying reptile things was bad enough, but when juxtaposed with sudden belts of screaming, it was like watching my 13 year old brother having a hissy-fit after not being allowed on the PlayStation. Sorry Eddie, but you were utter pants. In conclusion, Jupiter Ascending, is complete tripe. The attempts at acting are terrible. The plot is ludicrous. Okay, it might look good and fancy, but fanciness cannot save Jupiter Ascending from being one of the most boring and pain-inducing sci-fi films I think I have ever sat through. I think it's time to watch The Matrix again. Overall Score: 3/10",Jupiter Ascending
363,just_for_movies,Visually Amazing,8,7 February 2015,"Jupiter Ascending, quite literally, is one of the most beautiful movies I have ever seen. The visual effects and CGI were top notch; nothing looked unfinished. Everything from explosions and action scenes, to space ships and settings, this movie had all the ""eye candy"" one could want. The fighting sequences were executed perfectly; each one thrilling in its own way. Each singular planet or world was so stunning and precisely crafted, that one could almost feel themselves in it. The Wachowskis have made a truly gorgeous universe in their latest movie. Michael Giacchino's music fits each scene very nicely whether it is a fast paced chase scene, or a quiet and thoughtful scene. It has a mysterious and almost hollow beauty to it, which fits this movie perfectly.Alas, not everything in this movie is as good as the visuals. Channing Tatum and Mila Kunis give surprisingly good performances for the most part but some of their acting is just off. The other principal actors give good performances as well but all the acting could have been taken a notch higher. Story and Plot is where this movie is weakest though. It has so much ambition and intricacy that it is to much to fit in a two hour long movie. Even though two hours is a good length, the plot just wants to keep on going and therefor the loose ends are never quite tied up. The plot is never really explained to its entirety and while one can figure out the general idea, it is hard to go deep into it. It has huge potential but rather than using it, it discards it. I give it credit for being fairly original though, and not a sequel, reboot, or based of a graphic novel or book. Originality is a great thing and the Wachowskis do it best. Overall Jupiter Ascending lacked plot depth and great acting abilities, but it won it all back with groundbreaking visuals. Even though many more big movies are coming out in 2015, this one would be one of the best for all we know. It may not be everyone's piece of cake, but it sure is a fun sci-fi adventure that shouldn't be forgotten.",Jupiter Ascending
364,peterhill-84900,127 minutes gone that I can never take back!,5,11 March 2015,"Let me try to explain the plot to you. A woman from Earth is being hunted by some aliens because she's a princess or a queen of a powerful house in the universe, whilst Channing Tatum and Sean Bean set out to protect her. Blimey that's a mouthful for me. My partner and I were waiting in line to see a film when we spotted Jupiter Ascending, we love science fiction so it only seemed reasonable that we see it. Right? Yeah, I kind of wish we hadn't. To be blunt, the film has so much stuffed into it, I couldn't tell who was doing what, who was working for who and...yeah it's bad. The visual's are stunning and it's the only real reason the movie gets a 5. The action sequences themselves are not too bad either but overall it's just not a good film.",Jupiter Ascending
365,cesar_augusto,Talk about a wasted potential...,5,3 July 2015,"When I was watching this movie, it started quite interesting on it's own, already with a good actress. By the first half, I thought to myself ""now this is a franchise-material"", when it ended...""I stand corrected"".I mean...really, Wachowskis? Didn't you guys have ANY patience to developt your plot without forcing it's way so unconfortably? This movie could be a franchise of 2 or 3 movies precisely because they wrote SO much plot. But developted it in a completely clumsy and over-the-top fashion that we could barely understand. It was like Shyamalahn trying his take on Last Airbender, picking 20 episodes in a 1:30 hour-long movie. (Seriously Shyamalahn? we are so used with movies that are 2-hours, even almost 3-hours long and the only movie we would be willing to watch 3 hours of it you cut it by standart Christmas-special time? But I'm getting out of focus here).This movie was LOADED with unnecessary exposition, pointless character developtment, and some of the weirdest actings ever. I'm talking about you, Redmayne, you either whisper like the Godpidgeon from Animaniacs, or yell like another cartoonish character. Either way, you're acting was AWFUL.And again, this movie had SO many good ideas to make it longer! An intergalactic empire harvesting human life for immortality? BRILLIANT! A simple girl from earth finds out she is the reincarnation of the QUEEN of this freakin' intergalactic throne? AWESOME! Explaining Reincanation as the same code of genes repeating in an individual? MAKES SENSE! Her ""siblings"" are all selfish jerks wanting to take a fat slice of their inheritance, even if they have to KILL each other? PLEASE! It was almost like reading the premise of a Sci-Fi Game of Thrones.But no, we got hours of long-talk expositions, badly-developted characters, and rip-offs of SEVERAL movies placed together. Combined with a brilliant idea and beautifully-designed sets, this movie is a complete dish of ""dissapointment"".",Jupiter Ascending
366,attilabarcellos,A below average Sci-fi movie,3,14 June 2015,"A below average Sci-fi movieBefore finally watching it, I've read some reviews here and my expectations weren't high. After watching, I can sum up in five points:1 – A noticeable number of plot holes;2 – They've made the movie shallow to gather more viewers;3 – The directors relied on special effects to mask the actors' and plot' flaws;4 – The (bad executed) tentative to make the movie teenager friendly to attract the public of successful franchises;5 – A rich universe was created, but impossible to explain in two hours. Probably the initial plan was a trilogy, after being condensed in one movie. The result isn't good. Making a good Sci-fi movie nowadays isn't an easy mission to accomplish. Viewers are addicted to a frenetic and mindless action, and the history isn't crucial to the masses. And, to make a movie is an expensive enterprise, and the director must entertain the crowds, so the point of equilibrium is to make a movie with loads of action without forgetting the plot and, in the case of a Sci-fi movie, science is needed also. In the Jupiter Ascending, I couldn't see much of science, but only a lot of impressive things that looked more like magic than science to me, because absolutely nothing was explained how was possible, like the teleport, the tattoos, how they extracted the ""essence"" from humans, how people was killed in the gatherings or harvests, haw they created the protagonist and who created him, where and so on Why there were dinosaurs? Why did they speak English? And about the ""reincarnation"" thing, another ""dust in the wind"". How a girl born from a woman from earth could've be the reincarnation of a empress born almost hundred thousand years before, some light-years beyond?! And, despite she was the reincarnation, she didn't have nothing to do with a empress. The behavior, the lack of courage or intelligence.just weak in all matters. So, Titus kidnapped her family to force her to abdicate, but if she abdicated he would gather all the earth population, and she only realized that in the moment she was about to do that! In the end, everything lacked of credibility and watching the movie was a painful experience, specially when remembering that came from the Wachowskis brothers.",Jupiter Ascending
367,chasburch,I wish they'd put as much thought into plot development as visual effects,6,13 February 2015,"As the Matrix trilogy progressed, it became evident that the Wachowskis were uneven at best at complicated plot exposition. Long boring monologues (sometimes dressed up as dialog) served to advance the plot at the expense of pacing which slowed to a crawl. In Jupiter Ascending, the good news is there are many fewer languorously paced plot advancing monologues. The bad news is the Wachowskis are no better at plot exposition. And there is a lot of exposing to do.The viewer is force-fed a Matrix-like alternate Universe history humanity's purpose. And in setting up what could have been a multi-movie story, the movie needed better plot exposition. The usual Wachowski eye candy is there, and as a visual experience you can find contentment. But the shame is that it could have been so much better.",Jupiter Ascending

Wow...unless this movie is aimed exclusively at 10 year olds this is complete and utter joke. Some spoilers ahead...though I don't think I can spoil anything.Where do I begin... Acting - Mila Kunis, just please stop doing ""serious"" roles. She is walking, talking and interacting on the emotional level of a 16 year old girl shopping at a mall....I won't even mention the rest. Not worth mentioning. Story - other than the somewhat nice idea that earth was populated by a race of superior aliens in order to be harvested one day...that's a cool idea. The rest just doesn't make any kind of sense. The heroes motivations and actions are child like.Special effects which are supposed to be THE thing in this movie are just OK. For a movie of this budget? They could have done 20 times better.and finally...SOME FREAKING LOGIC. I know this is a sci fi movie, but for the love of goodness how can you think the audience is this stupid? Caine is thrown into the void at some point and struggles for some time until he finds a thingy that turns into a space suit and gives him air and stuff. AIR PRESSURE CHANGES!!! Hello?! He would die in a matter of seconds.Caine is fighting a dinosaur like monster. At some point they go shoulder to shoulder and the monster bites Caine...just enough for him to cringe from pain. A thing of this size with the jaws it had, could easily bite off his entire shoulder with next to no effort.These two are the ones that come to mind right away, but things like this are all over the place.Complete and utter garbage.

370,alombardy,So bad it's good or just plain bad?,5,11 June 2017,"At this point no one will be going into this movie thinking they're seeing anything spectacular. Most, like I did, will go in wanting to just enjoy a few hours of crazy,stupid nonsense for a bit of a laugh. But does it live up to the 'so bad it's good' status? On balance, I think so.Now I watched this with a few drinks in me so my recollection of the already incomprehensible plot is not the best so I won't recount it here. All I really remember at this point are lots of overly long and over-the-top action sequences, painstakingly bad exposition and 'funny' dialogue and the campest overperformance of the century by one Eddie Redmayne. He really is the star of this dumpster fire and I laughed hard every time he and his jelly like lip movements came on screen.Overall, I did enjoy it for all the wrong reasons, as I'd been hoping, and still maintain that while the Wachowski's don't always make 'good' stuff, it's almost always entertaining in some way. This is true junk food and is the sort of thing to watch when you really want to just check out for an evening. As such, it's hard to give it a fair rating; just know what to expect going in and you'll enjoy it for the sheer ridiculousness it pumps into your eyeballs.",Jupiter Ascending
371,janefgdoe,Seriously underrated cosmic fairy tale,8,17 February 2017,"Putting a space opera on the screen is a very difficult task. Usually, a space opera involves many worlds, a lot of exotic characters with complicated backstories and a number of plots and subplots with a significant amount of pages dedicated to world building. A typical space opera is more than 1000 pages long and one fantasy analogue - the Lord of the Rings took 3 3-hour long movies to be recreated properly. The Wachowskis sisters made 1 2-hours long movie which is complete in itself (even though I certainly would love to see a continuation). To do that, they chose to dismiss a great deal of scientific realism, dialogue complexity and character development. And they decided to bet a lot on visual richness and emotional straight-forwardness. Which totally worked for me. It is a truly entertaining story of modern Cinderella sucked in a galactic battle for power and well, more time. The movie combines conspiracy theories, romance and sci-fi. It has a very decent story line, a lot of impressive (even if not very realistic) action scenes and in the end, it even leaves a positive message to the viewer. It does everything a space opera is supposed to do in the 2 hours it plays. For me this movie was seriously underrated and fell victim to a negative campaign led by people who were unprepared for the specifics of the genre. Space opera is not hard-core science fiction, it just has different premises. And the fact that it made 90% of its money outside of the USA and that it is constantly rotated on HBO demonstrates just how liked this movies is outside of the USA. And I'm extremely fed up with critics saying it failed to deliver. Failed to deliver what? It is fun, it has original story (something very rare nowadays), decent acting, great visuals and music, it has no blood and gore and its cruelty levels are in the range of what was considered normal before ""Game of Thrones"" numbed our senses. It is a good movie told a bit as a sparkling fairy tale. On the negative side: I really wish the science in the movie was better thought of. Especially the part on Earth. In space, you can easily believe any unrealistic activities are due to technology upgrades or genetic mutations/splicing/whatever. But on Earth, there are no excuses. And some goofs are really annoying and shouldn't be allowed by serious script writers. Also, I'd love more character depth, just for the pinch of salt in the chocolate.",Jupiter Ascending

At the heart of the story it is about family and making the right choices when presented with great power for the protagonist.The overall story is decent, but does not get bogged down with geek speak or superheroes which is a trap a lot of scifi movies fall into. Definitely entertaining to watch and has a few funny moments too.The movie never takes itself too seriously and is watchable for the whole family. Even though there are no superheros in it, there is a pair of cool flying boots that are better than starlord's boots and make people want them as much as Marty McFly's hoverboard.

373,claudio645,Great idea and special effects but flat story and development,5,8 February 2015,"True to their history, the Wachowskis deliver an interesting concept along with top-notch special effects. The story however is poorly presented and the characters are two-dimensional at best. Mila Kunis is pretty and likable, but she's not a strong enough actress to fill in the gaps left by the writing. Conversely, the writing isn't strong enough to cover up Mila's deficiencies as an actress. I think if the Wachowskis are given another chance with a big-budget sci- fi/action flick, they will have to have somebody else write it. When this comes out on Blu-Ray, I'll probably add it to the collection because it's good eye-candy to have in the background while doing something else. However, I'll be waiting until it goes on sale before spending $$ on it. If you're a sci-fi buff and not in your teens, then I'd compare Jupiter Ascending to the first Star Wars prequel, only a notch or two below. Great visuals and an interesting world but science that makes little sense coupled with a lukewarm story and characters that never feel real at all.",Jupiter Ascending

If you go into the film wanting to take it seriously, it's probably going to disappoint. Jupiter Ascending is one of those great ""bonkers sci-fi"" films that is a visually sumptuous, delightfully absurd tale. This movie hints at so many complicated backstories that we never get a chance to fully understand that it leaves me personally desperate for a sequel. Aside from beautiful costumes and Great-Gatsby reminiscent spaceships, the movie has a refreshing amount of diversity which, while far from perfect, is a nice change from the mayonnaise permeated space-cultures of many sci fis.

Channing is the only good part of this movie. 1. Mila's mother is a Mathematician. I've never met any mathematician ending up scrubbing people's toilets. I mean, COME ON. It's hard for immigrants to start a new life here in USA. Trust me, as an immigrant myself, I get that. But USA has a very high demand of mathematician. She could be an accountant, a math teacher, or even a math professor. She probably would have to work as a house cleaner or a waitress while getting her degree or certificate. But after 20 years, still scrubbing toilets? NO WAY! 2. When you learn there are other intelligent life in the universe, what will be your first reaction? Doubts. Shock. Surprise. Excitement. Those would be logic emotions, right? None of those in Mila's acting. 3. Channing's gravity boots? It throws in some big words to give some explanation. But for a physicist, that explanation makes NO sense.",Jupiter Ascending
377,lilguyollie,....It's got some good visuals...,4,13 February 2015,"Jupiter Ascending has a lot going for it. It's written by the Wachowskis (Matrix trilogy, V for Vendetta, Cloud Atlas), it features a viable cast of actors and it promotes a seemingly interesting universe and mythos of its own. Unfortunately, though these things excited me pre-release they also pave the way for this movie to become generic...blegh. The visuals are great in this movie. Which is probably no surprise seeing as it's the Wachowskis, they are nothing if not pioneers of stunning visuals in movies. It's just a shame they can't make the characters as interesting. OK I'm being harsh because they weren't terrible. In particular Sean Bean and Channing Tatum are the best parts of this movie in terms of acting. Mila Kunis however is to me like Helena Bonham Carter. They both made their careers through being close to popular successful guys in show business and end up starring in a lot of they're movies. And Eddie Redmayne...I know he's nominated for an Oscar but the less said about him the better.This is a classic case of style over substance. The story is a blended, convoluted tale of Princess Diaries meets Phantom Menace. Mila Kunis is some space princess and she has to stop Eddie Redmayne (muffled laughter) from stealing it or something like that. I began to switch off after about half of this movie. It's frustrating because this movie could have been more if not for some questionable acting, awful dialogue and confusing story. It had the potential to be so much more than it is. I kind of hope for a sequel so that they can improve as they go but honestly I'm not sure if I could sit through that. In the end this movie is meh. It just exists though I wouldn't recommend it at all and therefore it gains a 4/10.Thanks for reading this review.

It is smart and interesting, brings new ideas to sci fi. The gravity boots remind you of the Silver Surfer's surfboard with Iron Man's rockets of control. The CG was awesome!

379,hounds_star,Leave all expectations at home,3,11 February 2015,"I can't believe this film is from the Wachowski stable! If you are a die hard Sci Fi fan, who enjoys anything with spaceships and aliens in it, you just might just find a few bits to enjoy. There were some good sets/action scenes/costumes/effects etc (although nothing fresh or particularly exciting) - but the storyline and script were really bad - and the acting was no better.With the exception of Channing Tatum, the entire cast were pretty feeble, if not hammy. I am sad to say this includes Eddie Redmayne, (who spoke in a very annoying, hoarse whisper virtually the whole time - apart from a couple of sudden outbursts). Whilst I feel that Redmayne has recently more than proved himself to be a brilliant actor, fully deserving of the Golden Globe and BAFTA awards he received for his outstanding performance in The Theory of Everything, for this film, I think I sense a Razzie may well be on the horizon.",Jupiter Ascending
380,Jacobhemphill96,Do not believe these lies!,9,6 February 2015,"I honestly cannot believe the negative reception this movie has received. This was original, creative, full of incredible action and some very colorful characters. Jupiter Jones is a house keeper of Russian descent, makes her living scrubbing other peoples toilets and hates her life. Little does she know that her entire life is about to get better. Millions of light years away the Matriarch of the Abrasax, a group of wealthy aliens who own many planets unknown to those on earth, has died and her three children are competing for the rights to own earth. The oldest of the three, Balem finds out that Jupiter is the next heir, puts a bounty on her head and wants her dead. A bounty hunter, Caine Wise comes to her rescue and the adventure is on through the galaxy. Say what you will about the Wachowski Siblings, but to me they are two very creative geniuses. This Sci-Fi epic was probably one of the best i've ever seen. The fight scenes were well done, the spaceship designs were fantastic, and i haven't even got to the giant flying Dinosaur/Saurian Minions yet. Oh yeah this movie has those too. If you are a fan of Sci Fi i have 4 little words for you. GO SEE THIS MOVIE!",Jupiter Ascending
381,petricor,Jupiter Almost Ascending,6,25 April 2015,"Jupiter Ascending is that film you watch and lament over, because you realize that while it could adequately entertain you for two hours, it could have easily been much more.There are problems with the pacing and the love story is appallingly contrived. The writers seemed so confused as how to write a female character they made her spout some lines about always falling for Mr. Wrong and while there are indeed women who think that has befallen them, they certainly don't say such lines to the man they're falling for, especially after knowing them for what seems like an hour's worth of time.There is often a sense of dialogue replacing actions where characters say what's on their mind for what seems like two purposes: 1. to let you know just how clever they are 2. to make sure you're following what's happening. And it is cringe-worthy no matter how strangely poignant and serious the ideas coming out of their mouths happen to be. This film could have been better if they translated this kind of dialogue into meaningful actions and if they had one more hour to work with, because in a blockbuster very-long-action-sequences movie, they feel out of place.This is definitely not The Matrix. Not even close. Okay, wait, there is a ""the chosen one"" vibe going on and the plot does turn very grim, but it's not allowed to digest in the proper way and it's not taken seriously. And it doesn't need to be The Matrix to be good, but the plot turned sour in the last act (Balem, why, oh why? I do not understand your actions in the third act? Plot hole, gaping plot hole.) If you're alright watching adequate movies, then you shouldn't have a problem with Jupiter Ascending. The good news is if you like some sci-fi and action and are willing to go along for the ride, you should be entertained (the Brazil-esque bit was fun!). I just wish it ended up being something more.",Jupiter Ascending
382,invernessmovieclub,Visually astounding but tiring and stupid,4,24 February 2015,"Directors of Jupiter Ascending, The Wachowskis, arrived on the movie scene back in 1999 with landmark action sci-fi 'The Matrix' which revolutionised the action genre with its ground breaking special effects. Despite making a couple of worthy follow ups, The Wachowskis have never scored another Matrix-like hit in the 16 years since. The directors themselves have said this is likely their last big chance handling a production of this size before studios withhold the enormous budgets they have been accustomed to. Has it paid off for them? Unfortunately not. The prologue tells us that Jupiter Jones (Mila Kunis) was born just as the planets have aligned and therefore is destined for great things. Years later Jupiter is stuck in a dull life as a cleaner along with her Russian family. It all takes a turn when she finds strange alien creatures called Keepers in her bedroom and is subsequently kidnapped and, unbeknownst to her, sent for execution. Caine, a crossbreed human/wolf, (played by Channing Tatum) rescues her and they are forced to flee to keep her alive. Caine explains that Jupiter is the Queen of the Universe reincarnated and the three current co-rulers (the original Queen's children) will be forced to give up their inheritance unless they take action. The eldest brother Balem (Eddie Redmayne) has big plans to harvest mankind for their resources and Jupiter is now in the way. Visually Jupiter Ascending is literally out of this world – the Wachowskis are true visionaries when it comes to creating worlds – everything looks amazing from the creatures to the huge space stations – the special effects are practically flawless. The first action set piece is also brilliantly rendered as Caine fights off a number of hunters across the skies of Chicago whilst keeping Jupiter out their hands. Unfortunately the plot is pretty unoriginal – pretty much the Matrix over again – a special one needs to save humanity from dark forces. The directors do their best to keep things fresh and it's clear that every dollar spent on the film is on screen, however it all gets a bit tiring after a while. Whilst Tatum and Kunis are fine, Eddie Redmayne is portrayed as the big bad, however he is far from threatening and is near useless. With any sci-fi movie you accept aspects will be far-fetched but Jupiter Ascending is just a step too far. As with the Matrix trilogy, the ending was flat and likewise with Jupiter, it's uninspired and leaves too many loose ends untied.I really admire The Wachowskis as filmmakers - they strive to deliver amazing spectacle and originality with every movie they make. Whilst Jupiter Ascending delivers as a spectacle, it is a major disappointment as a movie. It seems like they will have to make do with smaller budgets in the future.",Jupiter Ascending

This movie had such a great potential - a fresh idea about a generically modified alien race, that looks for identical genes in people anywhere in the universe. Thats ok. Effects - ok! Actors - decent. And then here we go: Story - barely existing, foggy and pathethic. Dialogues - laughable dull mess, written by a bot, who was forced to read all Paulo Cohelo books. Characters- they are as stereotipical as they come. Chaning Tatum with puppy ears rocks though. The whole thing was painful to watch - there wasn't too much story to follow and the actions of the characters did not make any sense.Horrible movie, really.

Despite the reviews, it was an intriguing premise, Mila Kunis is equal parts cool and hot, and some IMDb reviewers noted that that some movies are worth seeing just for the special effects.They were right about the special effects - very cool, and I saw it in 2D. Am not a fan of 3D, but Jupiter Ascending may be the first movie I return to see in 3D.As for the script, was it the best? No. But, not nearly as vacuous as some have said. It good enough not to be a distraction.Character development was far better than just the two principals (Kunis as Jupiter, Tatum as Caine). Not a lot of time was devoted to other character development, but they did a decent job with the time they did spend. Redmayne as the chief antagonist was far better than most gave credit.All said, this movie was worth my time, and if they produced a sequel I would see it.",Jupiter Ascending
385,keith-774,"Gorgeous, but hollow",3,22 April 2015,"I had higher expectations for this film. The only expectation that was met was the breathtaking CGI. The story was beyond unbelievable, reused far too many story lines from better movies and/or books (everything from Soylent Green to Cinderella), and there was zero, zippo, nada character development. Worse, the story was jumpy with everyone suddenly in sync with current action without any description of (or even a hint about) how characters got to that point. The worst was when Jupiter starts spouting legalese at Titus. The story even laughs at itself when he responds ""you're a quick study."" No kidding, let's ignore the possibility of alien languages and ignore even further the bureaucracy that is as slow as ours but different in any other way and yet, when she steps off the ship after being captured by Titus' people, she's already up to snuff on the specifics of law regarding royals relating to the very situation. My My! That is a quick study! The whole movie's full of nonsense (in every sense of the word) like that. The only character that developed to any degree was Caine. Good dog! The Wachowski's haven't had a clear home run since the Matrix, and this sets them back. Way to go back to cleaning those toilets, your majesty!",Jupiter Ascending
386,shnames87,meh but still entertaining,5,26 December 2019,"This was definitely interesting but i wouldn't say all together a good movie. It definitely seemed like should have been part of a much larger movie.It was a pretty fun fast paced science fiction movie, pretty bonkers at parts for sure. There was some really unnecessary romance parts that did not seem to fit into the movie at all. A lot of explanation was quickly brushed over and didn't go into the detail it should have. Some of the characters were not explained at all and i have no idea why they were doing what they were doing even though they seemed to have kind of big roles.Cast was great though. Channing Tatum did a good job playing the hero but I wished his back story was a little more explained. I thought Mila Kunis was outstanding even if the movie wasn't all that great her performance in it was good and I think she is a generally good actor. Eddie Redmayne can play a villain pretty well and I would really like to see him in that type of role more often, I was very impressed with him as a bad guy.Over all i would so sure go ahead and check it out.

Without giving spoilers...you'll easily pick out the actor who is giving a RIDICULOUS Brando-meets-Zoolander impersonation. The whole movie reeks with pretentious characters. It's awful.If I was to compare this movie to another, I'd think along the lines of Transformers 3. Maybe 1 good action scene???? Bottom line...You would have to be simple minded to enjoy this cheesy movie.I will add... I'd skip this movie if you are mother with a 14-or-younger child.

Not as bad as the guy playing Darth Vader in the latest Star Wars, but damn close! But to be honest, all of the acting in this movie is just plain awful...

390,martin-graupner,Poor recipe,5,7 March 2015,"There is not a piece of a narration in Jupiter Ascending with the potential to fascinate or surprise or to astonish. And that alone is very saddening. The flick is build around CGI and costumes and a very poor copy of the Matrix plot: A no one is chosen to save the world and dives, like Alice in the rabbit hole, in an invisible universe. Unfortunately under this narrative DNA is only an epically bad written repetitive pattern of Jupiter being saved that you don't care what happens, because you know for sure, she will be saved again. You get a feeling for the constructiveness of every bit of tension, and not in the good way. You are literally ripped out of the fiction. But the movie is not that bad. It is worse. The viewer gets bored by the visible intention to create a universe for a franchise by over-explaining the most uninteresting crap, tried to get relieved from this tension desert by foreseeable love and action jerk. 176 Million Dollars to make THIS is embarrassing.",Jupiter Ascending
391,ReasonablePiper,Not Very Good,4,23 October 2015,"I didn't expect much from this movie, and I didn't get much out of it. The whole thing is just kind of ridiculous. The story is all over the place, with new information about the world being introduced constantly. The lore could have been interesting if it wasn't so much wasn't crammed into such a small amount of time. It wasn't a short movie, but it felt rushed. The romantic relationship between Channing Tatum and Mila Kunis' characters was beyond cliché. It was so unbelievable and I just didn't care. There was a particularly terrible piece of dialogue. After explain that he is more related to dogs than humans (even though he looks way more human), she replies with, ""I love dogs."" Such awful writing, and it even implies something pretty disgusting that I'm sure they weren't going for. The action wasn't impressive either.The best I can say about the movie is that it isn't terribly boring, but it is completely forgettable. Also, the ending is really bad. After her family saves up money to buy a telescope for her and randomly give it to her, she says she has a date but won't say with who. (Side note: The family members laughed way too much in this scene to be anywhere close to realistic. It felt like I was watching a bad Lifetime movie.) She acts like she wants to have a serious relationship with Tatum's character, but she can't introduce him to her family because he's part wolf, so it seems stupid of her to go around bragging about her date, presuming that she will have future dates with the same guy whom she can't introduce.

393,JimmyG100,What happens when you cram too much into a single movie.,6,9 February 2015,"Remember that old gag from The Three Stooges where Larry, Curly, and Moe would all try to walk through the same doorway at the same time and they'd end up getting jammed? Well that scenario pretty much describes the plot of Jupiter Ascending, an ambitious attempt by the Wachowski's at crafting their own space opera, which while entertaining in its visuals and action, fails to keep up with its own ambitions. First I'd like to say this movie is beautiful. The opening action scenes in Chicago are fun to watch and once we get off the earth we see an extremely detailed universe that you can tell had a lot of thought put into it. Unfortunately the best way you can tell is from all the exposition. Now there's nothing wrong with exposition, it's necessary especially if you're going to do a fish out of water story about an earth girl that learns she's actually space royalty. Unfortunately the movie gets so caught up in its own exposition the titular Jupiter is never really given a chance to reflect on it all and just sort of nods her way through it. There's no real discovery of the new world she's been thrown into, it's just explained to her and she reacts accordingly. Meanwhile there's a subplot about Jupiter's family back on earth and how her cousin is in trouble because he already spent the money he was expecting to get from Jupiter donating one of her eggs. This is played to comedic effect and it works a little, however, it's soon dropped so the family can be kidnapped by Jupiter's genetic... space son? So he can hold them hostage and force Jupiter to sign the earth over to him. This is her other genetic space son, not the one who wants to marry her and kill her so he can own the earth... are you following me? I don't even remember what her genetic space daughter wanted, but all three of them are involved with harvesting humans to create a sort of fountain of youth they can bathe in to stay young. Basically the earth is like a farm where the space royalty grows and harvest humans every few centuries... I'm not sure if it's only every few centuries or if they wait for the population to get to a certain point then harvest it. It's not very well explained. So, the main villain's plan seems to be to harvest the earth while he still owns it, but then Jupiter claims it as hers about halfway through the movie so that threat is gone pretty fast. Which is why the bad guy then kidnaps Jupiter's family to force her to sign the earth over to him so he can harvest it. No need to worry though because Space Wolf Channing Tatum is there to save the props previously known as characters from death meaning Jupiter can hold onto the earth and the bad guy meets his implied demise, although I have to imagine they left it vague to keep it open to the possibility of sequels. I gotta say, I appreciate what's trying to be done here. Unfortunately there's not much room in the plot for characters to actually move around and develop. But because they spend so much time explaining things and setting up all these plot points it's impossible to get a satisfying resolution to everything and most of the points brought up are just dropped. The movie ends with Jupiter back on earth, now the owner of it, yet the only thing that's changed for her is she's happier living her life as a housemaid because she gets to fly around the Sears Tower with Channing Tatum now. Shouldn't more have changed for her? Shouldn't more have changed for her world? She doesn't know what it means to own the earth, well maybe that's something that should have been explained by the end of the movie!It may be unfair to compare this to The Matrix, but at the end of The Matrix you actually feel like things are happening, at the end of Jupiter Ascending you're left kinda wondering what the whole point was.This movie actually may have played better as a TV show. Or even split into two or three movies. Stretch the exposition out a little so you can actually do something with it. And most importantly make Jupiter a real character with an arch, not just someone who just goes along with everything until she needs to be saved. I'll even give the Wachowski's the benefit of the doubt and assume that somewhere there's a longer directors cut of this that actually brings about a better paced and more satisfying resolution. At least I'd like to see it if it does exist. I would totally be up for watching a 3 hour version of this movie that actually gives it room to move around in its elaborate world as opposed to this 2 hour cut that feels like it can't settle on what it wants to be about.As is, this movie seems more concerned with explaining the world it takes place in as opposed to giving us a reason to care. It's not terrible, and it actually can be very entertaining at some points, but it just can't keep up with itself.",Jupiter Ascending
394,MegaGothmog,The cool visuals are the only redemption.,4,30 April 2015,"OK, how do I put this? In short the movie had great visual effects and everything looked so real. But that is the only redeeming thing about this movie. The story is kinda meh, and the characters are not very interesting.Let me start with the visuals. THEY ARE AMAZING!! Everything, from earth to Jupiter (the planet, not the girl), from the buildings to the environment, everything looked amazing. The high-tech toys that the characters were using did not seem unrealistic, but more like stuff that we could buy in 2050. I am waiting for that. Every last detail about the buildings, clothes, jewelry, plants and planets is there. It was one hell of a visual experience.But now for the bad part. The story seemed kinda weird. Jupiter Jones (Mila Kunis) finds out that Humans are not the only ones in the universe, and that she is actually some reborn queen from another planet. It was explained but it went really fast. They should have explained it a bit more. She is this uncertain protagonist that is kinda being dragged from one situation to another.The characters are also kinda bland and cliché. She is always super uncertain with what everybody says and just goes with it. Caine Wise (Channing Tatum) is this ?werewolf? hunk who lost his wings (Werewolfs have wings? Apparently yes) and slowly falls in love with Jupiter (the girl, not the planet). Sean Bean also makes an appearance but had so little to do with the plot, except for explaining 3 things, that he is not really needed. I guess Sean needed a paycheck. Also the main bad guy, Balem (Eddie Redmayne) is the weirdest bad guy i have seen in a long time. I think he tries to pull of a Voldemort like attitude, but it is not working. He whispers all his lines, with 2 yells, and that just seems weird and makes him difficult to understand. He doesn't look intimidating or scary, just really really tired.In total it is kinda a one-time only movie. I watched it once and I don't think I'll watch it again. The amazing visuals are not enough to safe this movie.",Jupiter Ascending
395,j-w-b-concepts,"I thought it was great,,, take it for what it is",8,10 February 2015,"Take this movie for what it is, and I am sure you wont be disappointed. Its a science fiction action adventure that to fully enjoy it I believe needs to be seen in IMAX 3D. I am sure many movie buffs will disagree and go on how the story was lacking, but not I. I enjoyed the story very much, and for someone who is not a huge fan of movies such as this ended up really getting into it by the time it was over. For starters it had that 5th element feel with the characters, and futuristic setting, but also had a dash of mid evil fantasy with some being of royal blood owing estates that were much more than your average kingdom. Visually this movie was absolutely stunning, and I would see it again in Imax 3D solely for that purpose. (Do yourself a favor and spend the extra few bucks to see it in Imax 3D). The only real downfall I would have to say is that at times the characters did try to add some comic relief which I think fell short mostly because of the attitude of the character and not the actor/actress playing it. I am sure I could pick out a couple of other things that could have been improved upon or left out, but that would be nit picking at something that I think ended up being far better than I expected. Maybe I just went in with extremely low expectations and is why I was not let down. With what is out right now for movies I would have this listed as a must see.",Jupiter Ascending
396,joao-luiz_mjr,A good visual experience riddled with countless frustrating flaws,5,3 March 2015,"Jupiter Ascending is the tale of unassuming, cute brunette Jupiter Jones, a quiet and unimportant girl who suddenly (and quite literally) discovers she's the queen of the world. The movie is full of fantastic scenarios, richly colored palaces and futuristic locations and elements, but for every interesting visual there is a frustrating decision or illogical idea just lurking around the corner, waiting to get you when you're still wide-eyed from the previous wonderment and make you want to pull your hair off.Jupiter's father died before she was even born by being shot in the liver and instantly passing away. It's also worth noting that he valued his stupid telescope more than he valued his own life (not to mention his attempt at wrestling the equipment away from assailants who broke into their home to steal three random pieces of furniture also put his wife and their UNBORN BABY in danger). Our main character is herself somewhat tragic. She wakes up every day at a quarter to five to clean the houses of rich Americans and her life is so depressing she is willing to sell her ovaries to purchase a telescope and bring some joy to her boring existence. The actual medical procedure is interrupted firstly by grey martians that have been instructed to kill her and then said murdering is itself interrupted by the movie's male protagonist, Caine, bursting in to rescue her.It says a lot about this review that I am much more interested in complaining about how convoluted the attempted murder is than in noting the very high visual quality of Caine's dynamic rescue. Seriously, the aliens have been hired to kill her and have their target completely vulnerable, laying on the operating table. Instead of jamming a scalpel in her eye and being finished with it, they take the time to sedate her, make her float in the bed and then suffocate her, giving the hero just enough time to arrive, kill all of them and save her. While we're on the topic of Bad Decisions Made By Villains, how about when Evil Brother nº Who Cares tries to kill Caine by sending him to outer space? Sure, on paper that sounds just like the cruel, hopeless death a standard villain would assign to his hated enemy, but in retrospect it would probably have been more effective if he hadn't left Caine with his FLYING BOOTS on and depressurized him in a room not filled with easily accessible EMERGENCY SPACE SUITS.In short, if you can look past the logical flaws and not feel immensely frustrated with situations like the ones I presented above, Jupiter Ascending is an interesting experience. This review is somewhat tainted with negativity because my subjective viewing didn't get much emotional response, but many of my friends were completely enthralled with the spectacular visuals and the many concepts presented in the narrative, which is why I feel the necessity of pointing out it might be a good film for some people.",Jupiter Ascending

I put off studying for a final exam (one of the last in my college career) in order to watch this. Long story short: Mila Kunis gets attacked by aliens while she's donating her eggs for money. Channing Tatum shows up with plasma roller blades, a Halo-esque shield, and a gun that makes a really funny noise. He fights with Djimon Hounsou (Guardians of the Galaxy) and Rila Fukushima (The Wolverine) and saves the girl. They run. They get in another really drawn-out fight.Somewhere in here it gets explained that someone died and her kids want Earth as their inheritance. Really kinda vague on this part.Back on Earth, the pair goes in the woods and finds Ned Stark, miraculously healed from his decapitation at the hands of King Joffery. Wait, no. They find Sean Bean, which is close enough.(I think he actually survived this movie, which is why I gave it two starts instead of one).Bean and Tatum fight, and suddenly Kunis is able to control bumblebees, which is where I walked out. This movie is just utterly a waste of time. It is incomprehensible. There's no chemistry anywhere between any of the actors. It's a bunch of individuals playing individual roles and sucking at them all. The script is horrific, and Kunis needs to go back to The Black Swan, because she left her acting ability back there.

Easily distracted. Crippled by sexual frustration."" Okay, that last sentence doesn't really apply here.I remember seeing the trailer for this on the big screen a couple months back. I came away from that thinking this would be the greatest sci-fi movie of all time. If there was an Academy Award for not living up to expectations the Wacky siblings would have another little gold statue to go with the four awarded to The Matrix in 2000.This is not a bad movie. There are aspects of it that are excellent. I really like the general premise: The human race is millions of years old and spread throughout the galaxy. Our planet was 'seeded' a hundred thousand years ago and human life is farmed to provide eternal youth for the wealthy galactic elite. But, Earth is fast approaching it's optimum level where it will be harvested, to maximise profits, thus ending life on the planet.It's one of the more visually spectacular movies I have seen. The special effects are outstanding, the costumes and make up are lavish and the battles look incredible. It also features the equally stunning Mila Kunis as the aptly named 'Jupiter Jones', who is the genetically reincarnated version of the mother of 'Balem Abrasax', an immensely wealthy and powerful galactic royal who happens to own Earth.Mila could be used as a metaphor for the whole movie. Beautiful to look at, but sorely lacking in depth. The cast as a whole are OK, at best. Channing Tatum is Channing Tatum but with a goatie and wolf ears. I have to say, from an aesthetic point of view, if I was the Wachowskis I'd be a little disappointed with him. He is clearly a guy who can get women into theatres and in this he is shirtless for a good hour, yet he seriously looks like he's let himself go a little. Don't get me wrong, he still looks substantially better than I could ever hope to, but if I was handing over his pay cheque I'd insist he be carved up like Hugh Jackman as The Wolverine in X-Men: Days of Future Past.Sean Bean is solid as 'Space Ned Stark', while Eddie Redmayne, fresh from winning an Oscar for his portrayal of Stephen Hawking in The Theory of Everything Movie, is just plain bad as Balem Abrasax. He is like a futuristic Voldemort with Tourettes syndrome. Worst villain ever.Redmayne would have a good case if he chose to blame the script for his sub-par performance. The dialogue is clunky at best. For any sci-fi movie to work you need to be able to suspend your disbelief for a couple of hours. That is nigh on impossible when you are regularly scoffing at the dribble being spewed forth.This will go down in history as one of those movies that could've been an all-time classic, but just doesn't work. I like that the storyline is an analogy for how corporations rule our world and we are their unwitting slaves. It's a film that could convey an important message, but unfortunately, it gets lost in translation. 6/10See all our reviews at www.facebook.com/shenaniganmoviereviews",Jupiter Ascending
404,coleman601-504-844864,A Perfectly Enjoyable Adventure and a Visual Feats,6,6 February 2015,"For all the complaining people do about remake/sequels they never seem to go out and see anything truly original. Well here you have it. Jupiter Ascending will not be my best movie of the year, but I'm really glad I saw it. I was never bored or confused of shaking my head at plot points, I had a really good time with it.First, the negatives to get them out the way: The Villain. I don't know what the actor was going for or what the directors told him but it's certainly a weird performance and ultimately he never comes across as a major threat. Although his Winged Devil/Bat/Crocodile Henchman more than makes up for this. Second: the first act. It's a little shaky and the pacing is kind of off. For some reason they decided to include scenes in these far off worlds and characters from the get go instead of letting the audience experience them with Mila Kunis' character. As a result you end up with scenes of characters talking about things that at the time have no baring on anything you're seeing.However, the rest is a great ride. The cast - apart from the villain - do very well with the material. Kunis comes across as likable and funny, suitably down to Earth but progressing toward strength and confidence as the film goes on. Sean Bean is a damn bad-ass when he's on screen and steels all the scenes he's given. But most surprising is Tatum. It seems after paying the bills with Jump Street and then flexing his real acting muscles with Foxcastcher he's finally found his true screen presence. He comes across as a very capable warrior with a good heart, but also very sympathetic at the same time.The visuals are spectacular. The Wachowskis really blew me away with the scale of this universe they've created with highly imaginative worlds, technology and action sequences which are all very thrilling. If you like world building (like me) you'll be waiting for them to bring out the ""Art of the Film"" books to appreciate it even more. Combine all this with a brilliant score from Michael Giacchino to set the mood and you'll be fully transported to these incredible settings.All in all it's a fun ride with a shaky first act and odd villain, but the cast will keep you interested and the spectacle will keep you in awe. If you love sci-fi or pure adventure then don't give this a miss.",Jupiter Ascending
405,danthsmith,"derivative, frenetic tosh",2,7 February 2015,"I took my son and 12 school friends to see this. I was told I had to stay and accompany them. Having read reviews (mixed) and liked the siblings previous films U thought how bad can it be. Dreadful! The 1st part is an overblown retread of the Terminator where a pretty urban drudge is taken up by a super-soldier from the future/outer space and told of her immense importance and bewildering hyper active action ensues. the green screen whizzing about was tedious and uninvolving and made you long for the stripped down intensity of the terminator. I started to enjoy spot the influence when a big section of Dune hove into view followed by a silly Brazil section complete with Terry Gilliam cameo. After that it was off to outer space for lengthy Phantom Menace style exposition when I'm afraid I left so i suppose this review is a bit of a fraud. Sorry if the ending was moving, exciting and witty instead of plodding, overblown and derivative.",Jupiter Ascending

I'd say ignore the haters and give it a go, make up your own mind. This film isn't in my top ten but i didn't hate it. I get the feeling that there are 'Matrix' haters stalking everything the Wachowski's do now to hate on them cause they didn't like they way the Matrix ended. FYI i like their ending.

One person who is nobody in real life is a special and very important person in other word. The story is a bit predictable and times with too many clichés. Especially the ""saved at the last possible moment"" cliché.Acting is mostly OK although, it's kinda hard to understand all actions of Jupiter. I think that if a real person would be put in that situation it would turn out much more different. For the start, normal person would have gazillion of questions about the humanity, the universe, how, and why etc. But instead she acts like she doesn't care about anything. It was just too one dimensional, so it goes for other actors.The movie lacks any kind of ""wow factor"" and it doesn't make you wonder about anything, although it presents an interesting idea about the universe.

I ran it 3 times for private groups, and everyone was smiling as they exited, All had good things to say about it. The most common comment was that it was a lot better than they expected. . Good acting, astonishing visual spectacle, and a compelling plot. Don't let the negativity keep you from a great space opera. (Which wasn't always a term of derision) The Wachowskis have stumbled a bit in their last couple of films, but it's rather childish to continue to bash them because they haven't reached the heights they hit with ""The Matrix."" They still have the daring and imagination to create a new sci-fi experience, and at long last, a film without a giant monster to threaten the planet.

I must say I was pleasantly surprised. The intended plot is a bit like a classic fairytale, done in sci-fi format.The film has some brilliant technology and CGI, and creates a believable 'Dune' type alternative universe. I found it interesting and entertaining, which is my bottom line for all films, and it kept my attention to the end. I must say I was disappointed in the family scenes with Jupiter - it just wasn't believable that she could come from this background and have the abilities she later showed - presumed genetics isn't enough. Doubts are created about her which linger through the film. Jupiter's last family bits are also disappointing, my response was 'really?'.The sci-fi part of it is in my opinion heaps better than some recently praised sci-fi films. However the film is a bit like a first draft, brilliant in parts, other bits need to be dropped or extensively re-worked. But looking at the whole thing, it's definitely entertaining, I found it engrossing enough to keep the DVD and I'll watch it again. Overall I rate it an 8 taking off points for the family parts about Jupiter, and rating it on the sci-fi content.",Jupiter Ascending
410,OrigKRN,Movie had potential but just crashed HARD!,5,17 July 2016,"Hmm...where to start...First of all credit to the actors. The cast of the movie wasn't bad and the acting wasn't bad, but not good either. This movie could've became something much better. As I was watching...I was confused about EVERYTHING. The storytelling is just awful. Everything was so fast paced and it should've gone deeper into the story itself. All I saw was action and lights everywhere...The graphics and visual effects were too dense? cramped? It was just awfully hectic. It looked as if they were trying too hard. There really isn't much to talk about this movie. I give no credit to the directors on this movie. Usually the Wachowskis direct stunning movies. Overall...I can explain this movie in two words...RAPID and SMASHED!",Jupiter Ascending
411,azeron40,"Visually Stunning, well worth seeing on the big screen",8,9 February 2015,"I saw Jupiter Ascending at first showing. It was Visually one of the most impressive movies I have ever seen. The acting was well done, but, the plot had some holes. on the other hand. According to trivia, the submitted script had 600 pages, as most of you know the 1 page/minute rule, would make this a 10 hour movie. So I would imagine a tremendous amount of the plot was left out for time. even I would not sit through a 10 hour movie, but, I do wish it was longer so at least some plot holes got filled, and characters got fully fleshed out. I highly recommend you go see the movie for yourself, on the big screen, if you wait to see it on the small screen later, you will regret not doing so.",Jupiter Ascending

Explosive action scenes filled with amazing special effects and sic-fi toys bridged with fast moving plot fillers. Simple movie but worth checking out. Seriously, the first 20 minutes where so filled with action that I couldn't pull away. Great stuff and good work Wachowski bro's. Milna Kunis is stunning and she partners well with Channing Tatum, the film isn't a love story, it is about a girl from Earth who is destined for greatness and how she has to fight to claim her right.Films like this are hard to come by so don't miss out because of undeserved poor ratings, there appear to be too many haters of this film on the site, definitely should be getting more that 5 stars.",Jupiter Ascending
413,otaking241,Better than it's being given credit for,8,7 February 2015,"So I think this movie is much better than it's being given credit for. As an SF film, the Wachowskis have done a nice job of crafting an interesting and intelligible world, and the narrative structure is solid if far from original. The major flaw is that none of the main characters are interesting--badly cast, badly written or badly directed, I don't know which-- but it deflates what would otherwise be a genuinely enjoyable movie. I still think it's worth watching, and one of the few films out right now that benefits from being seen in a theatre rather than at home.**Spoilers Below**To start out, for all that it lacks originality, I think the narrative in Jupiter Ascending is actually fairly well crafted. What you have is a basic journey motif, in which Jupiter visits each of the three children of her previous incarnation before returning home. Each of the children has their own agenda and plans for Jupiter, and in the process of dealing with each she learns about her former self, the universe she inhabits and the circumstances surrounding her predecessor's death. The Wachowskis reveal the details of this universe gradually so that we learn about it along with Jupiter, and share her process of growth and discovery.Unfortunately, this ideal is complicated by Jupiter herself, who not only fails to grow through the film but seems to lack any real defining characteristics. This is undoubtedly attributable to the film's plot, which denies Jupiter almost any agency in the journey she is undergoing. Rather, she is repeatedly kidnapped by agents of one sibling or another, and later saved by her pursuer-turned-bodyguard-turned-lover Caine and/or his friends in the intergalactic police force Aegis. The few times she actually makes a choice on her own she is either being duped or giving in to threats from some other party. Casting Jupiter as a damsel in distress rather than someone who takes charge of her own destiny is a huge missed opportunity, and in my opinion the movie really fails for so manyCompounding this failing is the casting of the main characters. Both Mila Kunis and Channing Tatum are easy on the eyes, but neither has any real gravitas, or even a persona to bring with them to their role, and neither makes much of an effort to develop one within the film. Their performances can be most kindly described as ""inoffensive""--but that certainly isn't enough to make the audience care about them. Even the inevitable love connection that develops between them feels false, tacked-on and forced. We don't see Jupiter fall in love with Caine--she has to tell us, and his confused reaction is not nearly so bad as our own.The reason I think so many people have given this film the cold shoulder isn't that it's unoriginal. Compared with last summer's blockbuster Guardians of the Galaxy, that film was less original. But it had the smirking, winking camp that makes audiences think they're in on some kind of joke (as they give more money to the Disney/Marvel insipidity complex). Jupiter Ascending does not--it's presented seriously, without camp, and no smirks whatsoever. I don't think it takes itself too seriously, but it doesn't try to make any jokes at its own expense either, and I don't think audiences in this time are open to a serious SF film of this kind.On a final note, in comparing this film with the Wachowskis most famous and original effort, The Matrix, I think there are more parallels than people are currently crediting them with. First, Jupiter Ascending is not really a rags-to-riches story. Sure, Jupiter goes from a cleaning woman who tries to sell her eggs so her cousin can buy a flatscreen TV to the owner of much of the known universe, but it is the power than goes with that role--not the wealth--that is important. In gaining the power to save the Earth from harvesting, Jupiter is The One in the same way Neo was in The Matrix. Second, one of the underlying themes in both films is the danger of commodifying human life. In The Matrix, humans become batteries to power the machines that control them; in Jupiter Ascending, they become the serum that allows the galactic aristocracy to achieve immortality. What's interesting is how this message has been influenced by the ~15 years between the films: in a post-Occupy world obsessed with income inequality, the threat comes not from a robot overlord but an uncaring, self-obsessed ""entitled"" class that exploits other humans for its own gain. In this sense Jupiter Ascending may have more in common with last year's train wreck Elysium, but is a much, much better effort.",Jupiter Ascending
414,Starbuck823,Nearly got it...,5,8 July 2015,"As stated in the summary, this movie is a nearly - nearly makes it but fails in coming together.Visual effects in this film are amazing - it could (and in most part) is watched for this alone.The background story is space opera style and when combined with the visual scope, it holds a bit of promise. Where it is let down is the scripting for the characters. The two leads - Mila and Tanning - have to work with weak dialog. The actors do what they can but the script has little development which makes for a somewhat awkward underlying romance and little explanation to why this occurred. The siblings have a slightly better go of it but Redmayne's choice in how to portray is not the best. Lucky he followed up with Theory of Everything - this role could have been a bit of a career dampener. I also found Mila's character choices a bit silly - it was suggested at the start that she was to believe the good in people but with her life experiences you'd think she'd be a bit more savvy to reading people.Overall, the visuals and story scope are quite good but the main characters are the weak link.",Jupiter Ascending
415,mraiche1980,What the hell did I just watch?,6,8 May 2015,"There's plenty of good special effects in this movie, but the story is beyond confusing.It takes about half an hour for the story to actually get started. From that point, it just gets more confusing. Winged lizard men, a random elephant guy, a villain with an unexplained messed-up voice... yeah. The plot is so confusing and the characters are so difficult to keep track of that I just stopped caring toward the end.The only think this movie lacked was a few clowns running around in the background.

BUT, if you can move past that fact, the movie is fine. It may not be amazing, but at least you won't regret the money you spent on it.So the good things - The visuals are pretty amazing, elaborate costumes amazing scenery. I particularly like the way the huge storm on Jupiter is pictured. And the space ships have a really cool look to them as well. The plot line may not be that mind blowing, actually it is quite clichéd. But I did like the different perspective on aliens. It describes how humans are harvested (just like we harvest animals) on different planets in order to produce an ether that extends life. This was a fresh outlook even though the plot line wasn't the best.Now the bad - Well, the acting could have been better. Chaning Tatum was....meh, probably because he didn't need to show much expressions. Somehow I didn't feel Mila Kunis fit her role. Not many memorable characters.

When the ruler of the most powerful dynasties dies, a war for the inheritance breaks out between their children Balem (Eddie Redmayne), Kalique (Tuppence Middleton) and Titus (Douglas Booth). But on Earth and in complete ignroance yet another possible heir is possible: The young Jupiter Jones, unaware of her fate and working pretty unsuccessful as a House cleaner. However, when the genetically modified ex-mercenary Caine (Channing Tatum) tracks her, all her life is changing upside down. He gives the young woman a glimpse of her true nature, which could affect the balance of the entire universe. However, Jupiter's descent also poses great danger in form of Balem who wants to see them dead at any cost...Having had almost a day now between watching the movie my opinion is pretty clear, when leaving the cinemas I was not sure if I liked Jupiter Ascending or not. Reason for this is that I would have wished that the main characters would have developed a bit better. The special effects, the action, and other elements are fantastic in this Movie. The Movie looks amazing and as do the space ships, the worlds they built were fantastic and believable as well. I loved that, this is what makes out a good Science Fiction Movie as well. But I found the story somewhere a bit predictable and now and than it has its flaws. The coolest thing for me were the Boots that Caine used for flying.Within the 127 minute this film is having on running time it tries to build a complex new mythology of a trans-universal order. This probably was done to have a proper setup for eventual sequels.I really liked the chemistry between Channing Tatum and Mila Kunis, had they had deeper developed Characters I think this would have been a brilliant movie. The end leaves a lot open and I am sure this franchise will continue.Verdict: It is not the best Science Fiction Movie ever, but alone for the amazing designed Worlds it is worth watching this Movie on the big screen. The story is not too bad either.",Jupiter Ascending
419,kaustubh241997,Nothing more than a CGI overkill,5,17 February 2015,"Well , it's been a fairly long time since a Wachowski movie has popped up in the theater and ever since matrix , one thing that I ( not just me I guess ) build my expectation for their movie is to either top the matrix or at least be a decent reloaded movie. Jupiter Ascending made me feel the same thing again. When i paid my buck to watch this movie one thing i was really sure about was the fact that I will be a bare witness of 2 hours , non-stop , CGi action with explosions and 'AWW' moments striking me from the screen , and for that aspect ,I congratulate the Wachowski's for a stellar show of Computer generated set pieces that overthrow and put the visual shows of movies like man of steel and transformers to shame. One thing that Matrix did right was to build an eerie , mind-bending story that not just grips us to the narrative but puts our brains into a varied dimension o0f thoughts , asking questions , piecing clues , questioning the very existence of experimental reality .I have absolutely no idea as to why the Wachowski's have failed to deliver that since that moment. Jupiter Ascending as a package is a disaster in many levels and in this review i will breakdown the movie and highlight it's glaring problems and specifically justifying my rating of 5. 1) Story :- NONE. Seriously , if you are a person who wants to watch a flick spend 2 hours rejoicing the very pulp of a well crafted narrative , let me warn you right away this movie is not meant for you ! There is little to absolutely no story involved in the making of this movie. The major glaring problem being that the plot is cliché with you telling the poor person sitting next you exactly what would happen in the next scene. Some of the odd plot devices are beyond hilarious and add laughable oddities that rises questions as to the very existence of a planned plot in the movie. In a jest , there is a girl named Jupiter, who is important to the story (why you ask ? because she is important the plot tells us that's why ! )There is a man Caine Wise, comes to earth gives a vague reason takes Jupiter to an intergalactic battle to claim the rightful . Seriously,you as a movie watcher can add your bits of story and still make it more interesting than it's current state. 2) Casting and Performance :- Casting in this movie is good, not perfect , but good. Jupiter played by Mila Kunis ( who voiced Meg from family guy ) plays the role of Jupiter, her acting though not polished is fairly enjoyable. Channing Tatum is the man of the movie who does his very best to hold up his character trying real hard to make his character look like the "" DUDE"" , the main guy , the badass and so on , and like is aid does a great job is trying his best to hold the show by himself. The other main guy i can see in the movie is Sean . What the hell !? his acting is at par or slightly better than Bella from twilight ! I am not exactly sure if the source material given to these actors were bad or if the actors weren't a bit interesting in acting for this project but something fell short somewhere and the Wachowski's had to pay for it. Like i said , though the acting was good at best , the characters had no depth , no proper arc defining them or no satisfying conclusion either. 3)Direction :- This is exactly the reason why this movie got a score of 5, the direction and CGI. Though the Wachowski's have failed in the aspect of creating a well defined set of character lists , they have done a splendid job with a visual treat. From the time Jupiter encounters Channing Tatum mah main man , your jaws drop with a sense of ' AWW. Artificial lighting , specific bandwidth of sound spectrum ranging from subtle background tunes to significant explosion noises , the art team and Designers did a splendid job putting every penny of the production cost to useOn a whole I can say that Jupiter Ascending is a guilty pleasure movie with 2 hours of Brilliantly choreographed actions probably making all that's worth of the money you would spend in buying tickets for this movie with little no story to back it up. I would recommend you to watch this movie in the theater for it's glaring visuals but wouldn't say that the experience would be a complete package. And for the question asked by many people about weather this is the Wachowski's turn back to the Matrix Formula . I say no ! I guess maybe that's for another project of theirs.",Jupiter Ascending
420,qadreya,Missed out on a golden opportunity,7,8 February 2015,"I will just flat out say it, this movie had a MASSIVE potential to be a blockbuster but failed. Im pretty upset because it could have been a fantastic movie with a lead girl that didn't have to kick ass to be liked. Unlike many actresses in such 'superhero' films, you always see them in tight clothes, killing people with a model face and walking away from explosions as though they are walking down a catwalk. But this wasn't like that at all, Jupiter was just a normal girl wearing jeans a flannel shirt for the first half of the movie (sure she had a couple of beautiful gowns later, but that was it) and she had laid back hair and average fighting skills but I enjoyed her very much. She was acting human, not some super human, and I could relate. The plot is the usual 'lets save the hero and protect her no matter what' kind of plot, but the 'how' and 'why' could have so much better, it was the key to making this movie a blockbuster. But instead the who and why of the plot was its downfall... There were way too many villains, each one confusing you even more about their intentions. I swear I couldn't keep up and just got confused. I still don't even know what really happened in the film. Channing Tatum was an okay choice but Mila was not. Maybe its not the right role for her, but she couldn't act at all, she basically just had three expressions in the film: happy, confused and distressed. Maybe another actress would have been a better choice or maybe Mila just needed more acting classes to be the perfect fit. The fighting sequences were so annoyingly long that you eventually just stop trying to keep up or even caring. Although, I will admit that they did have some great fighting scenes but they were the simple ones without all the gimmicks/props/explosions, just two people fighting each other hand on hand (and using a weapon or two lying around).The only reason I am giving this movie a 7 and not the 5.5 it deserves is because of two reasons: The visual effects and Eddie Redmayne. The visuals were amazing, and you could see the incredible details in the space, planets, alien lands and spaceships. It was truly a delight to the eyes, especially if watched in 3D. And oh, Eddie. This is my first time watching this man act as I have never seen any of his movies before.. wow... He raised the bar soo high that he puts all the rest of the actors to shame and it made me think, were Mila and Channing really bad actors all along ? He was just so great and the costume only made him even more mysterious. His voice, my friend believed, was over the annoyingly unrealistic but I didn't mind because its not supposed to be real life kind of plot. But let me just say that the only one who could keep up was of course Sean Bean, great as always.Is this movie worth watching ? No perhaps only if there is nothing else playing in the cinema.",Jupiter Ascending
421,Skruffbagg,Interesting Premise Executed Poorly,2,21 April 2015,"If you like a silly action spectacle with special effect to make the eyes bleed, then this may be right up your street, otherwise you will probably find it difficult to even make it to the credits.What I will say is that the Wachowski's have at least created an interesting universe. Sadly this only really seems to have been fleshed out in their own heads. The plot is at times so convoluted that it was honestly 40 minutes into proceedings before I even knew what the hell was going on. There is some terrible editing at the beginning of this movie.Mila Kunis literally serves this movie only for the sake of exposition and is not at all believable. Channing Tatum pretty much plays the same part he has in most of his movies except now he has pointy ears, guy-liner and magic boots. Sean Bean is reliable but that's about it. Eddie Redmayne on the other hand, wow. I couldn't actually believe this was the same guy who just won an Academy Award. For the supposed main antagonist of the film he is laughably unthreatening, it looked like a strong gust of wind would blow him over, and for some bizarre reason he affects a whispering Maggie Thatcher-like accent for the entire movie which makes him difficult to understand. The visual effects are likely to keep the young 'uns entertained, and for what it's worth they are fairly impressive in certain sections, however some of the action sequences are so busy you've got absolutely no idea what is happening other that big explosions and Channing Tatum looking intense.I forced my way through to the end (stopping to write this review 20 minutes before as I could feel my retinas were beginning to detach) and if you are over 13 years old you'll probably feel the same.If you like big dumb action-fests with the male lead rescuing the heroine over and over again against a backdrop of bright colours and explosions, have at it, otherwise I would avoid like the plague.",Jupiter Ascending

Firstly Channing Tatum's character's ''floating roller skates'' looked ridiculous. It made him seem idiotic and awkward. Very uncool... a 'hover - board' like in ""Back to The Future"" would have been better but it just looked strange to be roller skating through the sky. Secondly, Channing Tatum's Elf Ears? There didn't seem to be any need for these to distinguish him as an alien from another world...was it not enough that he could fly? You could have switched in Ja Ja Binks and I don't think anyone would have noticed. Eddie Redmayne spoke in annoying whispers that were an attempt to sound threatening and formidable but were unconvincing...and the special effects had none of the excitement and innovation of the directors earlier Matrix Trilogy films which unfortunately was the benchmark going into this. Mila Kunis?...well.... she coped.... Lose the ears, the voices, the unnecessary special effects and the overacting...and you might have something.",Jupiter Ascending

I went to watch the movie because i was like *what*? 5.9 rating? For a movie like this (Action/Adventure/Sci-Fi)? In a time when cinema is so strongly in the grip of corporate influence that the plot-line leads you directly into the sh*t-storms of open social media sea? Why does everyone think their unreflected meaning counts today? And why don't people have no proper cultural education anymore? Have we arrived in ""Idiocracy"", finally? I went into this movie with zero expectations. I tried to fire my bullets of criticism at everything i suspiciously spotted, during the first 15 minutes. And then i just noticed: this movie is not about the plot. This movie is about the message. Its a nice (almost exciting) collection of quotes from the top sci-fi movies of the 90s and all time, it even has scenes that looked like they were borrowed 'on purpose' to look exactly like certain intense legendary moments. It is visually absolutely stunning, and has such an overwhelmingly good flow of action that you know: the story is so basic, this is not what the movie is about. The story is just a vessel for something far more important. Look at this as a sensual spectacle, that features something that all the other (gruesomely overdone) visual feasts like Star Wars EP 1-3, Transformers and whatnot, or even the new Star-Trek movies (which i actually applauded to, because they were so strongly compensating what was done wrong in the past) did not have, or if it was there, it was unbearably, disgustingly false: a message. This movie might have a story which has been told many many times. We have seen them all. Even the message is not new, but it is there! And to *anyone* who dares discrediting buckaroo banzai in this context - please, you might seriously need to check your humor and satire detectors.Spoiler warning: * there are a few very beautifully placed, genuine moments of refreshing laughter in this movie, that feel good when you hit them. not as if someone slammed a corny line on the table and pushed a button that forced you to laugh now, as it seems common for nowadays cinema.If this movie doesn't at least plateau at a solid 7.6, IMDb has finally degenerated to what most of the people i know always warned me of: the bad breath of the opinion of the unskilled moviegoer mainstream.",Jupiter Ascending

The visual effects are essentially the CGI that everyone complained about from the Star Wars prequels, except somehow less crisp and coherent, leaving one looking a a screen full of blurry garbage wondering what the heck is going on. The story is basically The Fifth Element with neither the over the top humor nor the likable, interesting characters. It's basically a PlayStation video game without the benefit of being playable. It rushes from completely expected and unoriginal last second rescue to completely expected and unoriginal last second rescue with the predictability of clockwork, which leaves one not on the edge of one's seat, but wishing they would just hurry up and get it over with. It gets tiresome. The almost two hour run time feels like much more, and I kept checking to see how much longer I had to wait for it to be over.

The 'verse created by The Wachowski's is wildly ambitious and daring and some credit should be given for that at least. Sure, there are problems.The movie has 2 'endings' so my attention started drifting later on and for some reason, whatever the Wachowski's were attempting didn't quite stick, the movie clearly lacked the humour of The Fifth Element or the excitement of The Matrix. But damn! It was a kinetic and colourful effort and there's a some fun to be had in this universe.In the current economic climate, it's difficult to get anything green-lit, even for the Spielberg's of this world. If we keep on kicking these noble failures to death online and at the box office, the studios won't make them any more, and just stick with the tried and tested properties, sequels and reboots, saturating the market to death. The nay-sayers and negative, vibe merchants really need to review their understanding of what is to get a movie made in the current climate and then re-assess their definition what a 'terrible' film is, because more terrible than Jupiter Ascending is an endless line of predictable, bland and safe movies.Be careful what you wish for.",Jupiter Ascending
428,adamcrossstills,Jupiter Ascending could've been truly excellent.,5,22 April 2015,"This film was not completely terrible; the Wachowskis have created yet another fantastic world with great visuals and an inspiring musical score. But, the story is so unfortunately rushed, the action so quickly cut and dialogue so sparse that the film is emotionally lifeless and it's difficult to feel any connection to the characters and their story when given so little.Jupiter had the chance to become a fantastic sci-fi character, but the lack of emotional attachment just stops you from routing for her, from willing her on. This also isn't helped by the fact that, despite her being the central focus of the film, she does often feel very much like a back seat passenger. She is, for the most part, along for the ride with us as we discover what on Earth (or off Earth, as the case may be) is going on and from a narrative perspective I can understand how the Wachowskis would've wanted that. I do like how we are thrust into the story exactly as she is, without a clue, though I don't think it works 100% successfully thanks to the lack of depth and poor pacing in the story. Because of how her characters journey has been laid out Jupiter is sadly damseled multiple times, which becomes increasingly annoying, but she does eventually claim some agency in that she decides her own fate instead of the fate attempted upon her by others throughout the length of the film (pause for applause!). As for the cast Mila Kunis is a perfectly fine lead but she isn't given much to work with and comes across as quite bland. Eddie Redmayne is impressively creepy and for once I didn't completely hate Channing Tatum. Oh, and Sean Bean doesn't die! (hooray!). I desperately wanted to know more about this world and it's inhabitants than what was offered in 2 hours. There is so much to see, so much to learn and discover in the film yet we are like a stone skipping endlessly across a pond never destined to drop below the surface. Perhaps another trilogy from the Wachowskis was in order? the pacing of The Matrix trilogy really gave you time to soak in every aspect of that world, Jupiter Ascending is lacking all of that. There was no time to breathe, no time to take in any of what we we are given.It's all such a shame, this film could've been truly excellent.",Jupiter Ascending

I won't spend as much time commenting on the specifics. Everyone who voted less than 2 stars is dead-on. What I will say is that for every bad review of this ""movie"", make that triple for me. Acting has nothing to do with it. There is no acting necessary in a movie that could have been casted by animated characters or Lego people. What I will say is that for today's so-called progressive and tolerant, and whatever other PC termed culture we are supposed to be living in, the racism toward Russian people (I am not getting political despite all the lies and anti-Russian propaganda in the media) in this movie are abhorrent. Fine. Everyone has a right to their opinion and I can deal with comedy at the price of stupidity; but, Milena (Mila Kunis) is a former - and I mean that when I say FORMER - Russian. To see her flush 1000+ years of the very culture and history that gave her the background she needed to get anywhere in life, sold for a buck... is intolerable! Correction: Mila is not Russian. She is western Ukr-Reich. Her culture was flushed down the same sewer pipe right about the time her family left to pursue raising a racist self-hater in Hollywood. Russians are portrayed in Hollywood the same way Jews were once portrayed in 1930's Germany and akin to having African Americans portrayed by white people painted in blackface for minstrel shows in the 1800's.

The basic story is interesting enough but wasn't to me properly fleshed out and the characters don't really have a lot development. Eddie Redmayne could have been an interesting character but was just boring, hard to hear and poorly played. Without an interesting baddie it lacked focus and depth. Kunis was ok but just same character she has played elsewhere and Sean Bean is good and underutilized but Channing Tatum is just muscle in fancy shoes and shield.

Also, curious that all transactions were conducted with big, bulky objects (like every document needed its own iPad to cart around) and digitalisation seems to have been forgotten (mind you the bureaucracy scene was inspired).

A lot of the elements of the world the Wachowskis created seemed like they were created with some kind of Sci-Fi/Fantasy magnetic poetry set. I love Mila Kunis and like Channing Tatum, but they were not fit for these roles. It's like they casted super popular people in a super geek movie and it just wasn't a fit. Plus they had no chemistry. The worst part was Eddie Redmayne's overacting. How does this guy have an acting career? Is it just because he's British? I think the failure of this film comes from the Wachowskis trying to put too many elements in. In a way the movie is almost a parody of Sci-fi/Fantasy films. Like The Wachowskis dumbed down the entire genre to try to bring in a new audience of jocks and princesses. It's not going to work. It will appeal to overweight, bearded, males who spend Saturday nights writing fan fiction in their parent's basements. Because this is something they could have written. Also - the movie was heavily laden with anti-feminism. Another failed attempt at having a strong female lead. Mila Kunis falls down a lot and needs Tatum to keep rescuing her. She doesn't scream a lot though. I liked that. Lengthy unnecessary action sequences, forced romance, lazy story....the movie is a cliché wrapped in a parody dressed as a caricature of itself.",Jupiter Ascending

But I add my comments.The movie is not that terrible as some reviewers say giving a one point and calling it trash. Depends who you are, education, culture etc. Surely the higher the standards the lower you will rate this movie. Simply excluding the visuals I wouldn't give more than 3..The concept is good, the story sucks, the characters are shallow and undeveloped, the world is stunning perhaps the best so far in all sci-fi movies and thats what it makes the movie watchable.The main problem of this movie is the story it's so shallow, stupid and undeveloped, it jumps from one place to another non stop. Sometimes you get confused you are not sure what happened or why.They tried to fit a lots of stuff in 2hrs where they needed a lot more time like 2-3 movies.Acting is average or below bad actors and script/dialogs. Mila Kunis was expressionless, Channing Tatum could have been better given an opportunity. The other actors were average and some really bad. Only Sean Bean managed to work his role and make something better than the rest. Cardboard characters as someone said and I couldn't agree more. Shallow undeveloped like the story the jump from one point to another. Some important characters you would expect them to play a major role they appear only for few moments. Finally a villain or bad attempt of a villain, both acting and character get's killed and happy ending. Jupiter (Mila Kunis) rejects royalty and prefer to go back cleaning toilets and final scene surfing above skyscrapers along with her winged angel (Tatum). Uh some religious people would get annoyed by this scene.Final comment is that even the story and characters suck if you are into sci-fi this is a must see movie because of the visuals and the worlds this movie puts you in.",Jupiter Ascending

The villain was annoying, with a forced raspy whisper. Just a train wreck. You know it is bad when you can't wait for it to end and don't give a hoot how it ends.

I am a huge fan of space/fantasy/sci-fi films and TV shows, and this movie could have been great. The biggest thing that turned me off was about 1/4 of the way through until the end, they turned it into a love film. They probably planned to make all their money from the film by showing a trailer with Channing and Mila in it and draw a huge crowd. This movie was a disgrace and an insult to space/sci/fi movies. I had to stop it 3/4 of the way through to compose myself, just to watch the rest later so my review could be validated. The CGI was far too much. You couldn't fully grasp what was happening and the special effects felt like a kids movie. It was predictable and bland.

448,randaashraf-70075,A Spin on Cinderella,9,4 July 2015,"Brought to you by non other than Andy and Lana Wachowski, the makers of 'the Matrix' – Both wrote and directed this film.Starring Mila Kunis, Channing Tatum, Eddie Redmayne, Gug Mbatha-Raw and Sean Bean.Right of the bat I felt this is similar to the Matrix in the fast pace of weird alien like people coming and going. I never fully saw the Matrix so the comparison stops now.I could not wait to see a romantic movie with Mila Kunis and Channing Tatum and the fact that she's an ordinary girl put in an extraordinary situation is enough reason for me to see. This movie is perhaps an adult sci-fi take on Cinderella with a twist in plot line where she, Jupiter (Mila Kunis) the housekeeper/maid is actually the queen of Earth and is in love with her bodyguard wolf-man, Caine (Chaning Tatum). 'Bodyguard' yes another similar movie minus the Sci-fi issue but both have a murderer issue.The plot is simple Jupiter's Dad dies right after wanting to name her Jupiter before she was even born. He is killed for some unknown reason by who we don't know maybe he's a sir or a scientist that knows too much both of which are unrelated to the main plot line but is added to explain why she might own Earth.The sinister siblings who own the universe and all its planets want to murder her for just one more planet because they use Earth and its people as a farm for some immortality potion that regenerates youth where a 100 people per bottle can make a person centuries old look 24. That's a scary fact of greed that had it exist it would probably take place these sci-fi films exist for a reason.There is a lesson in this movie and it is taught through Jupiter's journey through a metaphorical jungle. The fact that Jupiter gullibly accepted to marry (Balem Abrasax) is in of itself wakeup call. This is because he only wants to marry her to have the lineage and ownership of Earth and kill her right after. The pushover will not be that for longer because God took over and pushed him over right after he tried to murder her. Love conquers all. Family comes first. All these basic humane lessons are central to this movie. Sci-fi is not esoteric it is the real world just amplified to point out how we see a massive issue as if it is a minor one. Believe in the unbelievable. The surreal is really real because dreams can come true so do nightmares too.I give the costumes and set design, directing and acting are all amazing. I really recommend it. However some issues were missing in it and they should have been explained or not added maybe. Case in point her dad who is is and reason for his death or why is she the Queen of Earth but actually is the maid and how in the end nothing changes except that she finds love.",Jupiter Ascending
449,pointsss,I had low expectation that i had lower even more,3,21 April 2015,"I had high hope for this movie considering it is a product by the Wachowski siblings. After casting Kunis and Tatum in the leads i started becoming a bit skeptical but still had high expectation until the movie came out and all the bad critics.After the first 10 minutes of the movie i was extremely disappointed in the story. It is a space move with a Cinderella character in the lead and an elfish looking male lead with air roller skating boots. Yes, you read correctly. There are a lot of scenes with these roller skates that can fly and Tatum skates like he is on the ground while in the air. This is most ridiculous thing I have ever seen in a high budget movie.Further in the movie there are more ridiculous things like alligator looking aliens with wings but I will not mention them as I don't want to spoil it for those of you who decide to watch the movie. Jupiter Ascending continues with a leak story made out of clichés in a bad combination. The move fails to deliver anything from it story line.The acting is also not very good. While Bean and Redmayne are trying to do their best in portraying their characters as best as possible, the characters themselves have nothing to offer given the story line. On the other hand Tatum completely fails in his job perhaps because of the elfish look and the air boots. I don't even want to mention Kunis as she gives absolutely no depth to her character.One has to mention the special effects and costume design. They are the only outstanding thing in the movie, especially the costume design. The CGI and the action scenes are also visually made very well, however, some of those scenes are negatively effected by the story line. Still if you like special effects, you wont be disappointed in that regard. Overall I gave this move 3/10 solely because of the CGI and the costume designs as it fails to deliver an original and intriguing story line. I lacked anticipation to see what is going to happen next. Everything was very predictable and the acting was below mediocre.",Jupiter Ascending

It is bad, of course but mainly in the acting department and this took a toll on the complete movie. Biggest failure is that both of the lead fail to connect and empathize with audience, they fail miserably at living out the written character. To me the writing was actually good. Few scenes could have really uplifted the movie, if rightly done like the emotional dilemma Jupiter suffers while accepting the marriage proposal and the huge setback she suffers when gets to know the truth. Finally, it is a one time watch, mainly because its coming from The Wachowski brothers (now, Siblings :))",Jupiter Ascending

454,darricklin,If Wayne Gretzky could skate in space/on air,6,9 April 2015,"Channing Tatum did his job well & Mila Kunis was pretty good as well. Unfortunately, the supporting cast of characters & aliens were a bit below par. The movie was not bad, it was just really hard to believe in certain scenes. If I had to guess, it seemed like most, if not all, of the budget went towards special effects.I could try & explain it, but it would be easier to just show some raw, opinionated numbers instead. The Plot would be like a(4/10) & Special Effects would be a (9.5/10). Overall, I would say it was a (6/10). The movie really had potential to be Top 10 feature film, but ended up being a Sci-Fi film with a savant syndrome.I did not see this movie on a big screen, rather, I streamed it on my laptop, so my viewpoint may be a bit biased, but I tried to be fair & honest with my review.",Jupiter Ascending
455,igorrogov,Rather shameful show,1,2 May 2015,"It is as if Lana Wachovski just have started exploring her girlhood and discovered some exciting fairy tales, Cinderella being her favorite, and so she wrote some fan fiction, modernizing the storyline as much as she possibly could. At the same time Andy W. tried mixing some old and clichéd sci-fi stories into some ordinary space opera. And then the two scripts somehow got mixed up in a drunken car accident, some pages burned, but the surviving ones were picked up by the major studio, which had terrible shortage of story-writers (who all migrated to TV series). And the execs thrown into the mix a few draft pages dropped from Terry Gilliam waste bucket. The result is appalling - both in visibly wasted money and effort and in sheer platitude of the whole show, - it is so painfully obvious that no wrinkling and twisting the bits of paper may ever replace thought-through complexity. May be OK for retarded 10-year-olds, though. But then, there are a lots of better movies for this sort of audience.",Jupiter Ascending
456,bushidoie,"It's beautiful, has good actors, and really interesting technology and alien characters",9,26 January 2016,"Okay, I'm going to start off by saying, at the time of writing this, Prometheus has a combined 7 out of 10 here on IMDb. Prometheus. And yet, Jupiter Ascending, has a 5.4. All of these things are not equal.The ONLY redeeming factor in Prometheus, is its stunning visuals. The plot, actors, individual and group logic, even the settings, either make no sense whatsoever, or have massive inconsistencies.Now, Jupiter Ascending, if you don't like the story, actors and scenes within the film, is still EQUALLY as beautiful, if not more so, than Prometheus. The point being, if you liked and gave Prometheus a similar rating, then you absolutely WILL enjoy Jupiter Ascending, it's gorgeous.I gave this movie a really high rating, for a number of reasons. First of all, Mila Kunis is her reliable, excellent self. She's developed well as an actress and this is another good edition of her prowess. She portrays the role of Jupiter perfectly, the only letdown being that she can come across a little too down-to-Earth at times later on in the movie, but that's what keeps her relatable to the audience.The main thing I adore about this movie, is the genuine and legitimate nature of the universe at large. Honestly, just look at the planets, the ceremonies, the costumes, even the different aliens, I felt totally captivated by the beauty, and feeling of a real living, breathing society. It's not perfection, but it leaves you intrigued, because there's really nothing you'll have seen that's like this, which is quite special. I really hope there's a sequel, if for nothing else, than at least just to explore what's been established, I wanted more time in this universe, with these planets and these people!Another thing I really enjoyed was the technology. I won't spoil it by talking specifics, because some of the different equipment and technologies are awesome to see, when you get that first look at them. Again, it's immersive, and leaves you wanting more, the special effects team were incredibly creative with some of the things they had in the film.The storyline is believable, and while a bit underdeveloped, it's definitely credible. Somewhat like a lot of Sci-Fi stories, it takes a back seat to the action and visual exploration on-screen. Realistically a sequel should delve into the story much, much further, but then, Star Wars never really did, beyond a couple of core themes.Overall, this film is very much like Star Wars or Star Trek, with a more creative hand guiding its presentation. Parts of Jupiter Ascending would improve either of those universes. If you enjoyed the exploration and discovery elements of those movies/TV shows, getting to see and know different species, planets, societies, then I feel you'll definitely enjoy Jupiter Ascending. The scenes and species on display are really colourful, and it's great escapism to be drawn into their world.The negative votes on this film, in my opinion may come from those who dislike a female lead, who gets rescued quite regularly by the strong male co-star. That could be males who chauvinistically don't like a female lead, or feminist females who felt that she wasn't strong and independent enough. Either way, I strongly feel the public opinion is biased, because this movie has a lot going for it, and if you approach it without bias and agenda, I think you'll really like it. Check it out for yourself, don't let the bad reviews put you off it :)",Jupiter Ascending

The poor script may have exaggerated the bad acting. Unrealistic responses to mind-blowing revelations: eg ""We're not alone in the universe!? Oh okay"".The bang-for-buck ratio. For $200 million this should have been awesome, and it wasn't.The overall feel that this was like one of those sci-fi series you see vomited out weekly of the US.Summary: This film had the potential to leave one in a shifted state, a bit like The Matrix did, but it leaves one cold, and you don't really care who lives or dies. I gave this 6/10 for two reasons, 1) To counter all the ridiculous 1 and 2 stars it got, and 2) For the special effects and visuals. This film is a 5/10.",Jupiter Ascending
458,line-schulz,I came out of the cinema with the biggest smile on my face.,8,23 February 2015,"I seriously didn't know what I was going into, when I went to see this movie. I had seen the trailer yes, but that didn't really prepare me for what I saw.I was so entertained, you wouldn't believe it! This movie was first of all one of a kind - I mean I want to read this movie, please make it into a book. I haven't seen anything like it, which was amazing and such a relieve. But the movie was hilarious too. The actors were amazing, they overdid everything. So much drama in such a small amount of time. Channing Tatum did a very good job. I really liked his character, because it was so unlike him. Same goes (without saying) to Eddie Redmayne, he changed his voice for this one - which made everything 10% better.But to be serious for a moment, this movie was quite earthshaking actually. When you're in the cinema you don't really realize it, but it's first when you start to think about the plot. They show you a whole new level of inhumane actions. You can't really grasp it, because when you start to wonder about it, you kinda ... don't wanna believe it. There's so much more to this movie than what you see. I came out of the cinema and wanted to go back in just to watch it again. There is so many small things to this plot, so many things you wanna dive into and learn more about. It was absolutely amazing. And the saddest thing about it, is that people don't know that this movie makes you think about life and how precious it actually is, and what people in power do to stay on top. But other than being one of the most entertaining movies I have ever seen, it also has so many epic moments where you laugh your ass of. This movie has everything.

I have a fellow film-buff friend who absolutely swears by the wachowskis as brilliant directors even going so far as to defend Speed Racer (I haven't seen it but I've heard generally poor things), but he hasn't shared his thoughts on Jupiter Ascending for some reason *wink wink*.
The plot is baffling, the dialogue is baffling, there's some Terry Gilliam-esque moments that don't fit in the already messy film. In the same year Eddy Redmane gave an amazing performance in The Danish Girl, he also gives us his performance here. Well I'll give him a pass because he definitely commits to this character!

460,yommimitaru,"Great visuals, loses substance trying to do too much.",7,19 May 2015,"This movie has a big plothole, like so many sci fi movies, if the technology they possess in this universe is so high, why do they rely on something primitive to achieve their nefarious goals? It's one of these issues with sci-fi that you see all the time, the worlds we create tend to reflect our world more than a future world. Most sci-fi is an allegory of our current reality filled with futuristic technology. The truth of the future is probably either far more odd or far more mundane than we'd imagine. I would wager that most of what we consider issues with ourselves and society today are either inconsequential in the future or solved. With that in mind I saw this movie as having a pretty simple meaning. Here on earth, there are a few haves, and whole lot of have nots. And as this movie illustrates, the haves callously consume human lives for their petty desires. I saw the nectar as symbolizing freedom, which in a sense is what unlimited time is. The competition for time exists today. The rich hire the poor to do everything for them, then punish the poor for not having the time to do what the rich do. They admonish us because we have to wash our own dishes, and take the time to raise our own children, or care for our own pets, while doing all those things for them.So, we have a young lady who is a maid, that becomes royalty, a good concept. But the movie just doesn't provide a very compelling way to experience that story.",Jupiter Ascending
461,Nestor_Sanchez,Flawed but enjoyable. Worth the watch in cinemas for the visuals!,6,13 February 2015,"I understand the critics that dissected this movie and hammered for the convulsive exposition and pacing. The film does lack In that department and at moments I felt lost in thoughs about the implications of previous expositions rather the immersing myself in the current scenes. That said, I don't think it deserves the low rating that critics have put on this. While the acting and script might not win Oscars they serve their purpose and deliver, certainly they where not terrible as many imply. Perhaps people keep waiting for a new Matrix and the huge success of that masterpiece eclipses any further project that the Wachowskis presents us? I've seen far worse movies with better critical acceptance and also masterpieces that only got the recognition they deserved after years passed. I don't have any doubt that time will will tip the scale in favor of this movie and that it will attain cult status among many sci fi junkies. The visuals are simply mind blowing! As a cgi artist I was surprised at the amount of detail and the incredible quality of the special effects. The great orchestral score helped pushing the feeling of grandiose spectacle and the costumes and world design are nothing but the best I've seen in years. Certainly an enjoyable experience worth the watch in th big screen to be fully appreciated. If you are a sci fan don't think twice and go see it! Movies like this need support even if they fail at some departments because they push the limits and take risks that too often big studios are not willing to back up.Visuals, score, art department: 10/10 acting, casting: 7/10 Script, dialogues, exposition: 5/107.5 from me, going to see again for sure!",Jupiter Ascending

Admittedly, the film at some points just seems to bumble along without any sort of direction, but having said that, it didn't bother me a great deal as I took the movie for what it was which is a bit of sci-fi fantasy action.If you're looking for the depth and thought provoking material as the Matrix was, then forget it, its not the same movie. If you are looking for a bit of fun with some superb visuals (some lovely fight scenes) and a great score (by Michael Glacchino), then I think you will enjoy this movie as much as I did.On a last note, I find it rather funny that people find gravity boots unacceptable but are quite prepared to accept other action movies premises such as a talking raccoon, a guy flying round on a silver surfing board and iron man.... go figure.",Jupiter Ascending
463,speakers,"A shallow, but beautiful movie",8,26 January 2016,"I can't review this movie without spoilers, so be warned.I actually enjoyed this film, my criticisms below are because I felt it was a missed opportunity to make a truly stunning film.Young Jupiter Jones is working as a cleaner with her mother; she gets up horribly early, works many hours and is presumably paid a pittance. Her astronomy-obsessed father died before she was born, hence her unusual name. Suddenly, by virtue of having the same DNA structure as a deceased member of an immensely rich family she is suddenly entitled to own the Earth. This family owns a massive industry that seeds planets with humanity, then farms them for a life-extending elixir. And by farm, I mean they kill everybody on the planet to extract this liquid gloop. Having found out about her, none of the remaining members of the Abraxas family are very keen on her. They want her inheritance, whether by marriage, by legal instrument or by death.Now immediately, you can see some problems with this story; the likelihood of there being a DNA match is very very low, but not zero. Also, you have to have found that DNA match, making it even more unlikely. And finally, you have to have made a provision in your will for this ""Recurrence"". What happens if they are both alive at the same time? Members of this family have been alive for millennia, what would they do? There is a policing force called the Aegis, but they don't seem to have a problem with the mass genocides that the Abraxas family commit on a regular basis; does that mean that murder is no longer a crime? Given that the DNA can match, the people they murder are the same as them, but it's okay because they run it as a business? That whole plot segment left me deeply uncomfortable, especially when some of the family take a stroll on a recently 'harvested' planet. ""I understand they feel no pain"", one says as they walk through the empty streets of a highly advanced city.We also meet Splices, people who have been genetically modified with animal or insect genes. Caine is part dog, Stinger is part bee. One character is obviously part rodent, some others are basically lizards with wings and a bad attitude. This seems a bit throwaway, maybe other Splices are around, but they're not introduced as such.There are splashes of humour, mainly from her extended Russian family, but also from her conversations with Caine; when she isn't swooning all over him (okay it's Channing Tatum, but still...). In the main, the film is slightly too serious for it's own good; you need to lighten the mood, so that when the dark comes you can feel the fear and emotional change.But what really stands out are the worlds the Wachowskis have created. The ships are amazing, the environments stunning; the backgrounds, especially in and around Jupiter, are often breathtakingly beautiful. The stunts are mostly superb, although they play the 'last-minute-rescue' card one too many times. They even make Chicago look absolutely gorgeous at night; their PR department should make some of their shots into postcards, although maybe not the bits when they blow up large chunks of the transport network.The actors are good; you believe in the burgeoning relationship between Jupiter and Caine and the family members are played as utterly spoilt brats. Eddie Redmayne affects a strange, languorous, husky tone, with an undertone of menace and a dash of crazy.The ending leaves many questions unanswered, they must have written it with a sequel in mind. It may never get that follow-up, which would be a shame; I would love to revisit this world, but the box-office barely covered production costs. Unlike the Matrix trilogy, where the world was consistent and coherent, where actions had logical reactions and where the resolution was unavoidable (if a bit of a downer), this world has too many plot-holes and inconsistencies. I suspect they took the idea of Cinderella (or the Wizard of Oz) and inflated the structure until it could not sustain itself. There is only so much suspension of disbelief an audience can take.Watch this for the spectacle, don't think too deeply about the plot and you will have a good time.",Jupiter Ascending
464,joekanuck,Why critics don't get any respect,6,8 February 2015,"I really don't like professional critics. Very, very few of them write a review with the money paying movie watcher in mind. You see, they never pay...for anything. I spent over a decade in radio, not paying for movies, and when your job depends on getting citizens to read/watch/listen to, what you do and say, it doesn't pay to be boring and just 'like' a movie. You must employ as much hyperbole as your thesaurus will allow, because of your deep seated insecurities that you might not be the next Hemingway or Arthur C. Clark or whomever your dream author is. They don't write reviews for the ordinary, ticket buying mook...they write reviews for each other. Trying to seem clever is much more important than giving a reasonable or honest assessment of a movie. Look on any site where user and critic reviews are displayed. It's a rare thing when their respective ratings averages are within 20% of each other.Granted, user reviews span the 'love it' to 'hate it' spectrum but for the most part, you can be assured you are getting their honest feelings. OK...rant over...Now for the movie at hand. I liked Jupiter Ascending. I thought every performance worked in whatever context it was supposed to...except for Channing Tatum's. He tried his best to be stoic, but ended up being as wooden as a log. Mila Kunis was especially good...given the mediocre plot development allowed by the seemingly endless space car chases. Basically, the movie needed much more time on plot, dialogue and character development and less on the much too plentiful, (though lovely), graphics saturated scenes.You probably won't feel much need to see it again, at least in a cinema, but it will make fine viewing while lazing on the couch.I really do hope there's a sequel with much more Mila, and a leading man who is much more Pratt much less Tatum, (what was with his eye shadow? It made his eyes look tiny...and not in a Dirty Harry way...more of a 'trying to read the small print on an aspirin bottle' way).

Many years ago, I gave ""Avatar"" two stars, but one of them was for the effects. But SFX are there now - we have the ability to make pretty much anything we can imagine come to life on the big screen. So - no more extra points for SFX. Compare a bloated toad like this film to a low budget gem like ""Moon"" - it's story and character that matter. Now granted, I am not a 13-year-old suburban girl, so maybe I am not the intended audience for this screenplay, and so missed something. But when a film full of action sequences (which are actually boring, if you can imagine it), makes me wish I was watching one of the Twilight films instead, you something has gone terribly wrong. I am considering invoicing the Wachowskis for the time I wasted watching this drivel.On the plus side, the state of the art for SFX means that all sorts of good stories might finally make it to the big screen, things that were thought to be unfilmable before.

I really loved it.It wasn't without it's faults. but it is completely forgivable because it is so exceptionally entertaining. It was obviously made for sequels. the overall point to the movie was to introduce the characters, the world they live in. who the good guys are, and who the bad guys are. Things they could have improved on. 1. Jupiter was a total ""girl"" (damsel in distress), and that is an insult to all woman. she needed to be saved. 3 times. by a man. 2. a theme song by a big artist like Sia, or Beyoncé. 3. she had to get saved 3 times. Come on. she didn't learn from the first 2, she had to get saved one more time. and then also a bonus save at the end. Get a girl with stronger convictions. 4. When will someone that gets blackmailed with the well fair of their families choose the greater good. I think as a society we are definitely ready for that. Things that I loved 1. 3D justified. I am super against 3D. but this movie was good enough to for 3D. 2. Channing Tatum 3. Great back story, really well explained. Totally understood what was going on, and why. 4. the chase sequence in the beginning was phenomenal. funny, and unique. 5. the ""transportation"" (ships, bikes) were so good. unique 6. costumes were amazing. 7. villains were bat sh!t crazy. and strangely likable.

471,chlump,Beautiful but chaotic and overwrought,5,12 March 2020,"The special effects? First class. The acting? Pretty good though the most antagonistic antagonist is overacted, which obviously was the director's fault and not the actor's.The potential of this whole thing was truly epic. But it was way too rushed and really lacked refinement. You can't fit it all in two hours. It was obvious the Wachowski brothers had way more in mind than could ever make it to screen. The mistake was trying anyway.It's like they were told they had no chance at a franchise or even a sequel, so in desperation tried to touch on everything they'd ever conceived in this universe of theirs instead of picking the most important aspects and doing them real justice.The result is a movie so haphazard, rushed, and confusing that it is impossible to form a true affinity for any character in it, except perhaps the Earth itself. We all know and love the earth and don't want it destroyed. That's about the only concern I could muster. There are so many disparate plot points and bits of exposition that there is no time to connect any of them.Oh and the balance of power is all out of whack. There seem to be like 10 good guys to every 100000 bad guys. And action scenes that show these good guys prevailing over and over and over against impossible odds. You can not suspend disbelief, it is just too unbelievable even for sci-fi. The sort of good guys with a whole ship can't accomplish things that the gravity skating love interest good guy can do with his eyes closed. Just inconsistent.If you collect all the plot points, mull them over, mull them over some more, watch the movie a second time, you start to see that there was incredible potential: Backstories, power struggles, technology exploration, multiple races, class warfare, galactic scale economies and societies, family struggles, exploration of society's weaknesses and strength, etc.A focused, solid story core with hints of all these other possibilities would have been so much better than trying to include them all in the plot. But the true irony is that the basic plot is oversimplified (every act is the same - run, chase, kidnap, impossible rescue) rinse repeat. Pump up the core plot, lighten up the need to touch on every aspect of the rich universe and family struggles, and this could have been the start of a unique new sci-fi franchise. In the end, I cannot recommend as a compelling show, Especially if you forget about a show the moment you walk out of it, but I can say watch it if you have an imagination and would appreciate pondering on the ideas of what could have been.",Jupiter Ascending

Spaceships are beautiful, costumes are beautiful, weapons and gadgets are interesting, alien creatures are very creative and diverse. Part of what makes everything so beautiful is that there is a lot of colour which is a welcome change from a muddy-brown and dark palette that is prevalent in action films in recent years.The story is - like mentioned in the summary - a classic fairytale. Bad guys are bad, good guys are good, it's won't blow your mind but it's good enough as a vehicle to explore a creative and engaging universe and give you a few laughs.So, if you are looking for a fun and easy going film with spaceships go see this and you won't be disappointed.",Jupiter Ascending
476,DMan_76,A Lot Better Than I IMDb Rating,8,25 April 2015,"OK. So it's not Avatar but it is a really good movie. I am not a fan of Channing Tatum at all. I think he's one of the worst actors of this generation and he only gets role because people think he's good looking. I especially hated him in G.I. Joe, 21 Jump Street, and their sequels. But I did kind of like him in this one and White House Down. I still have a bitter taste in mouth about how Mila Kunis and James Franco ruined Oz for me as well. So when I watched the reviews for this I really thought this was going to be garbage. After watching it, however, I obviously had a different opinion. The acting, as suspected, wasn't the highlight of this film but not as bad as you would imagine. The storyline was OK and somewhat believable if you know anything about Earth history and are not too wrapped up in religion to see that it is somewhat plausible (P.S.

477,Aurelia_Destiny,Very Exciting And Compelling movie!,8,10 May 2015,"I very rarely review anything, but I was so blown away that I rushed right to IMDb to do so.This movie was f***ing amazing! I absolutely loved it, like I did John Carter. It was romantic, filled with spectacular fighting/battle scenes, astonishing special effects and a very compelling and original storyline. It had an absolutely satisfying ending also and I never considered that anything happening in the movie was ridiculous, or unnecessary to the plot. Admittedly there were about three points in the film where it just seemed to jump ahead, as if it had missed a scene and suddenly something else was occurring. That was annoying, but perhaps it was just a not so good an editing job. It was minor compared to the rest of the plot and easily forgiven. I honestly can't figure out why it supposedly 'bombed'. I'm absolutely certain that it will eventually get so many fans that it will become a cult classic.

Any action is announced well in advance, you know who is lying, who is going to die, what plot the twists are going to be, and the ending will involve daddy's telescope, and yes she will get off with the werewolf; by the way if I am wrong about the ending it's because I didn't watch it all the way through, I fell asleep three times because the dialogue bored me to sleep.",Jupiter Ascending

But in 2015, they hardly don't know what they were doing.Jupiter Ascending tells a story so predictable, i wouldn't even care following the plot. You know what, there are only three things I liked about this film. The visual effects, the scenery and the costume designs, while the rest of the film sucks. The script was poorly written and was trying to be smart and thought-provoking even if it's not. The fight scenes and the climax of the film were very lousy and uninteresting. Mila Kunis fails to deliver the goods as the film's lead. And the writers even put a predictable love story between Kunis and Tatum which, I think, has nothing to do with the plot. They just put it there so that some audiences will like/love this movie. On the other hand, Eddie Redmayne plays as a villain and obviously didn't know how to act one. Argh!

Also the protagonist is a woman and not a stereotype, and then there's this dog dude who is actually pretty hot. (This totally reminds me of a fanfiction but in a good way)
Anyway, this movie is a lot of fun and a step in the right direction. I love classic sci-fi, especially when it's more feminist like in this movie.

494,bosozoku,Uneven space romance,5,8 February 2015,"""Jupiter Ascending"" contains many standard sci-fi action/adventure elements. You know them well - space travel, humanoid robots, energy weapons, and more. And most of these elements are beautifully done. But at its heart the film is an uneven and awkward modern romance. A Cinderella-like space opera, but with an evil Prince Charming.Having said that, I found plenty to enjoy. Breathtaking production design, generally excellent acting, unmistakable Giacchino score, and an answer to the question ""If you had unlimited wealth and power, what would you want next?""Mila Kunis is an unusual choice for female lead, but the camera loves her and she's appealing and believable. And Eddy Redmayne is terrifying. I always suspected he'd make a great villain. He does.Still, there are just too many serious flaws to give it more than 5 stars. Lengthy off-putting narration at the start, like a lecture you need to sit through before the fun starts. Too much complexity in the film's universe for such predictable plot points. Phony-looking gun battle scenes (especially with the gravity boots) that feel like you're watching somebody else play a video game. Unevenly written dialog that alternates between brilliant and corny. And I'm still not convinced that Jupiter Jones needs to be involved in galactic politics in the first place.Oh well. It's possible that an extended directors' edition Blu-Ray release might fix some of the issues. The theatrical release is spectacular but heavily flawed.",Jupiter Ascending
495,ScottSF,80s Flash Gordon + Fifth Element with a little Terry Gilliam,7,4 March 2015,"It was hard fought but Jupiter Ascending won me over by the end. If you like The Fifth Element, The 1980s Flash Gordon with a bit of Terry Gilliam thrown in (literally) you might find yourself pleasantly surprised. On the plus side the story was rich and textured and something I hadn't seen before. On the negative side, the actual dialogue was weak at part and some of the action seemed redundant; we get lots of the same type of action / suspense. Back to the Terry Gilliam angle, there was one sequence where I found myself saying this is so Terry Gilliam and last part of the sequence actually featured a cameo by Terry and in the very next scene Jupiter has a shout out line that no fan of Brazil would miss. If I could change anything I would make the film a full Gilliam film. That probably wouldn't help the box office but I would get it to the cult status faster and push it a bit more into satire which would have been fun. By the end of the film I did actually care for the character but if that had happened for me sooner, I would have found it more enjoyable.

If this would came out before Avengers, before Thor and Iron Man.. well, it would blow people mind. But this is new section, with all parts filled by movies could be seen before. Actor's were on top BTW.Probably to be little more excited about the movie you should be deep into conspiration theories and understand the main message of this film. UFO's kidnapping. Universe war of good and evil. Technologies and mind control are very hot topic today. This movie doesn't promote money, doesn't promote violence or sex. It promotes the idea there is more important things than one life. And this is probably the best about it. The love-storyline is easy. Nothing big about it. Kinda commercial and OK.First part of the movie is bit drama/comedy that brings you into the topic very slowly and gentle way. Information like ""earth is been colonized by human"" and ""genetic health"" comes in place very naturally and well explained. Probably if you are dumb and stupid, you would understand this topic easily and that is not discussed even in modern science. But again, this is not science movie. It's science fiction movie.

The exuberant special effects, for which the movie was way over budget, do not make up for the lame story and the subsequent repeat scenes from the previous movies' repeats in this production that are redundant and practically useless!

Sci-Fi is a very complicated and tricky genre. There is lots of science for a start (really?!). Obviously nowadays these types of movies are made for the meat market film goer with a large coke and a bucket of popcorn to munch on.

507,TeunRM,"Funny, action-packed, Metphysics within it's narrative, brilliant aesthetics and orchestra, repetitive plot with holes.",7,16 February 2015,"In this review I will summarize of what I believe the movie did right and wrong. As with any review I will do, I watched the movie twice to confirm my opinions, and analyze the concepts I might have overlooked.The Wachowski's are brilliant in their own right. The average viewer however, can not always appreciate their way of bringing screenplay to the Silver screen. All their past movies have been absolute favorites of mine. From Speed Racer, to Cloud Atlas to the famous Matrix Trilogy. It seems that the Wachowski's always want to try something new. And for this and many reasons more, they are my favorite set of Directors. Jupiter Ascending however, is their most confusing entry yet. Not terrible in any way though, quite the contrary actually. Nevertheless, the movie has problems finding it's own identity. This film tries to be too many things simultaneously, and in my opinion this leads to a rather illogical story. This movie has some terrific action, it starts of this way at least. After the first action sequence I wanted more and the movie kept at this pace until they go into outer space. This is where the film tries to explain how the Abrasax industry is part of a higher level of ""consumption"", and that harvesting planets(because more time is what everyone wants) is a normality. There are different alien types, from reptilians to the cliché looking aliens(in crop circles) to humans with their DNA altered. The scenes with Kick Gurry are just hilarious, as are the scenes where Jupiter is trying to register herself as queen where the Wachowski's are making fun of the government their work flow(just hilarious). The Wachowski's always incorporate smart clever humor that always brightens up a serious tone. I found it hard to get emotionally attached to any of the characters as they were either speaking the Metaphysics the Wachowski's are known for incorporating in their scripts, or about the Jupiter Ascending's universe it's background/information. The characters simply don't get enough screen time interacting with each other as it's always about the setting and visual effects. This leads me to believe this movie's script should have been simplified or made smaller. It should have been either a 90 minute movie with Titus out of the picture(the way they got out of his ship was completely illogical as well), or a 3 hour movie with more character development and interaction. It is clear that this movie was set out to be produced as a stand alone title. With only 2 hours as the running time and with such a big universe that needs explaining, the sacrifices made to present this story within the given running time leads to unlovable characters. The cast fits in the aesthetics the film wants to achieve though.The action scenes with it's special effects and Michael Giacchino's Score are such a treat that it makes this movie already worth seeing. This film is a complete work of art and I love it. Original craftsmanship from John Gaeta and team as always. Just like other reviewers have stated, this film is overly ambitious where the characters are just there to share their knowledge of their surrounding so it remains impossible to connect with them thus care for their actions. It is not the Matrix(1), and this is the very reason viewers criticize their current latest work for it not being that film. It always overshadows the beauty their films actually do have. Cloud Atlas is the best spiritual movie to date, Speed Racer one of the most visually appealing and in my opinion the most powerful ending any movie has to date. The Matrix trilogy is still unmatched with it's Metaphysical/philosophical depth.Where does that leave Jupiter Ascending? What is the statement of the Wachowski's with their latest film? I believe they wanted to make one of the most beautiful aesthetically appealing films of all time. And they succeeded. They have the right cast, the right visual effects and music. Overlook it's character's and story's flaws, and you will get one of the best Visual experiences in film. GO SEE THIS FILM for it's action and visual/musical presentation.

I'll see it again when it comes out on DVD and hopefully it'll make more sense then. But it didn't take away from the entertainment value. I agree with other reviewers...it seems like they wrote this complex story in a complex world, and then gave us the condensed, rushed version in the movie. I feel like there's more that we should have been told/shown.

511,jwalgren,For Better or For Worse,7,21 July 2016,"I did enjoy this film. The effects are amazing, the action is Oscar-worthy, the acting is give-or-take, and the science fiction universe would make any good nerd have a heart attack. This movie was plainly fun. A lot of people feel that it was lacking serious substance, and that it was very subpar compared to other Waschowski works, and I can't argue with that. The plot is littered with ridiculous, almost laughable, moments and the characters feel so miniscule and insignificant compared to the world the Waschowskis set up around them. The plan to save Earth from an intergalactic industry that harvests people to make an immortality serum, that has supposedly ""harvested"" billions of other planets... Yeah, I won't argue with those complaints.But on the bright side, the film isn't clichéd, offers somewhat relatable characters, and doesn't focus on some dumb, obviously forced romance like other sci-fi flicks. Also, I think people misunderstood the intention of this film. It's a film that isn't meant for the critics to love or for every asshole with a brain to nitpick, but it's a film made for us, the general audience, to simply have fun with. If you go into every movie you ever see only to critique and nitpick it to make sure you got your money's worth, first of all, I feel bad for you, and second of all, you'd be completely ruining the purpose of a movie: to ENTERTAIN.",Jupiter Ascending

She's goes from cleaning toilets to falling from skyscrapers to debating intergalactic politics with barely a gasp. She's the movie's eye candy and then they dress her in a long sleeve plaid shirt. The 'good guy's' heroism is nothing more than 'I can drive my spaceship really fast through the bad guys'. The DMV queen sequence is the middle of the movie is too farcical and cartoonish, it falls flat. There were some good ideas but the execution and direction doomed this movie to failure.

514,elevengood92,Excrement of the Galaxy,3,6 February 2015,"The Wachowski Sibilings once awed us with The Matrix, and despite a couple mediocre to bad sequels, people still were able to tolerate the films they produced. One of these films had me blown away (""V For Vendetta""), and they were doing, in Hollywood terms, pretty well.Enter ""Speed Racer"". Not only was it critical roadkill, but it also was a commercial blowout, having no steam at the box office before it began. Four years later, Tom Tykwer and the Wachowski's made the film ""Cloud Atlas"", which despite its mixed reviews, obvious yellowface, and even the fact it was commercially unsuccessful, I consider it one of my 20 favorite films of all time.So when I heard the Wachowski's were making ""Jupiter Ascending"", I had some excitement, along with some fear they could blunder. The trailers had me interested, and I actually kinda wanted to see this since I like science fiction. So, I went the Friday morning it came out to see it.""Jupiter Ascending"", on a galactic scale however, is a hot mess, a steaming, orange and blue lensed mess.The film itself is about a girl named Jupiter Jones (Mila Kunis) who is born on sea and lives the rest of her adult life with a very cliché Rus family who eats sausage, probably smells of vodka, and says ""Stalin's balls"" every time something goes wrong.However, while she lives a humdrum life, Balem Abraxas (Eddie Redmayne), an heir to a very large interplanetary corporate dynasty with 2 other heirs Kalique and Titus (Tuppence Middleton and Douglas Booth), wants her to die since she is a threat to his reign and also is the reincarnation of their recently murdered Mama Abraxas, who wanted to take away their product that adds time to their life by harvesting people (it's pretty much Soylent Blue) and taking baths in it as if it was filled with Dead Sea minerals. Caine (Channing Tatum) is an hover-skating ex-soldier human-wolf splice who is sent by Titus to bring Jupiter alive, while 3 bounty hunters who look like they were ripped right out of a Warhammer 40,000 Codex (same with the ships in this movie, with a little ""John Carter"" thrown in the mix) are after Jupiter also for Kalique, and therefore want to kill Caine. So after a space fighter fight in Chicago against Keepers (who look like cliché aliens) try to kill her, they unexpectedly get a car and drive off to his former CO, Stinger (Sean Bean, who doesn't die in this movie). This is where Caine finds out that she is royalty because bees (including Stinger, also a splice, but between human and bee) supposedly know loyalty. The point is, if they send her to Titus Stinger gets his bee wings back and Caine gets a pardon.However, hijinks ensues as her family is captured by Winged Dinosaurs in sexy leather jackets, she runs into all the Abraxas heirs whether it's for marriage, immortality, or so Balem can harvest Earth for life, and then finally returns back to her humdrum life (she ends up dating Caine at the end, who gets wings while she gets his roller skates).Now for the acting, I completely enjoy Mila Kunis, Channing Tatum, Sean Bean (who doesn't die in it by the way), and Eddie Redmayne as actors. However, everyone in this movie was completely miscast. I'm sure for Channing Tatum, who is on fire right now, it should not matter. Plenty of A-listers could brush off a dud pretty quickly, although for Mila Kunis it should hurt a tad, especially since she hasn't been in anything spectacular or successful as of recent. But of course, she will find work in time once she can be able to trust her newborn child with husband and fellow That 70's Show Alumnus Ashton Kutcher. Sean Bean finally has a role where his character doesn't die for once, but only appears when he is needed, and then Oscar-nominated actor Eddie Redmayne is in it also, and is shockingly the worst performance in the whole movie. His performance in the film is him sitting in a chair with the normal speaking voice of a hybrid between his performance of Stephen Hawking in ""The Theory of Everything"", Lord Voldemort, and shockingly Winnie the Pooh. It's so bad that when I hear it I begin uncontrollably laughing. After that film, I think Keaton could possibly get the Academy to screen this film and therefore manage to get back in their favor. It's only a hope, especially since Redmayne didn't play a sassy black woman in a fat suit.However, this film mainly just came off as beyond weird, but almost to the point of idiocy, whether it was the performances, the unnecessarily choppy editing, the messy script, or a great score placed in a bad movie, it's just a shame this script managed to get greenlit, unless Warner Bros has a thing for elephant men as pilots (and take the character seriously).It ends with the leads flying and hover-roller-skating towards the screen onto another adventure, but I think it's time to take them off the Abraxas product which removes aging, especially since this will bomb. It will bomb hard. Its like the bad ""John Carter"".D+ (3 Sean Bean's living through the movie out of 10)",Jupiter Ascending

I can't imagine how many people will miss out on such a good movie because of these misleading reviews. I tried to see what was so bad about this entertaining film and frankly speaking I could not.The story is unique and perfect. The visual effects absolutely stunning. Lots of effort was made in the making this film. I could definitely watch it for a third time as I have already watched it twice in the past five days.

The premise of the movie, that planet Earth is just a farm to be harvested by rich rulers and provides a bountiful supply of youth genes that keeps one young, is very interesting, but the execution of it is awful. I feel sorry for those who actually paid money to see it. The entire action is very formulaic, easily predictable, and overuses the damsel in distress trope. Really wish the ending would have been different too. Instead, it ends with Jupiter going back to cleaning toilets, only this time happily doing it. I disliked it much. I'm very disappointed in this movie, and I'm happy I didn't pay a dime to see it.

The moment you put this movie into the same drawer as other trashy sci-fi movies such as ""The Ice Pirates"", ""Flash Gordon"" or ""The last Starfighter"", one could even call this Movie 'secretly brilliant', since it's sticking to every camp-space-opera trope one has ever seen, while still being constantly over the top in a surreal manner.For completeness sake, they could have hired a power-metal band to do the soundtrack, that's about the only complaint I have.",Jupiter Ascending
518,gods-lov46,WTF was that?...,3,17 May 2015,"**only one spoiler at the end of the review (and not much of one in my opinion)**Seriously, WTF was that? I must have gone into this movie with way too much expectation. I don't see how I could possibly have been more disappointed. The screenplay was CRAP. The acting was CRAP. Only redeeming feature was the cinematography and maybe the premise. Next time, maybe they should take some of that big budget and spend it on writing camp for the screenwriters and acting camp for the actors... Mila Kunis' portrayal of Jupiter Jones was asinine and apathetic at best. I've seen better acting in high school plays honestly. At best, she manages to annoy you. At worst, it made you yearn for the good old days of ""That 70's Show"" which was an Oscar performance compared to this one. I found it hard to sympathize with her character at all throughout the movie. Channing Tatum's portrayal of Caine West was equally lifeless, but, in Tatum's defense, it is Channing Tatum. Although he has made some action films which weren't too bad since they were action films, such as White House Down and the GI Joe films, he's best known for Magic Mike. 'Nuff said. It's not like you were expecting him to have a breakout performance. However, even amidst all this poor acting, the award for the worst actor has to go to Eddie Redmayne for his portrayal of Belam Abraxas. I literally cringed at every scene when Belam was on screen. Over-act much? This was not the right movie for him, and it was painfully obvious. It's The Theory of Everything not the Actor of Everything, Redmayne. Please stick to what you know and find a new agent ASAP.The movie itself was so poorly scripted, I won't even bother to go into details. You watch it at your own expense. However, as promised, I will mention one spoiler, a scene at the end which particularly annoyed me amidst all the bounty of annoyances in this movie. Jupiter, after experiencing everything and knowing that she now owns Earth, has joyfully gone back to cleaning toilets and cleaning other people's houses. Of course... why not? No need to start making any sense at the end of the movie when the whole movie up to that point made no damn sense. Then, of course, she must take off on the magic roller skates courtesy of magic mike. Those magic roller skates were another high point of this movie by the way. SO...what are you waiting for?

They were very hard to focus on, especially the fight scenes and the technology made the movie disjointed. The story line was good but incredibly similar to DUNE from the 1980s. Instead of Spice, you've got trade in Genes. ""Spice is Life"", ""The most important commodity is Time."" Abraxus, Atradies, etc..... Similar coloring and lots of brass and mechanical objects. I enjoyed the bureaucracy scenes. Five of us went to see the movie and we all came out with the same feeling that something was missing.

Is totally wrong. The action does not happen in the future , the powerful family does not need a new heir and the protagonist is kidnapped and tries to survive. This may result in stopping the reign of a tyrant but is more of a side effect of her fighting for her life.Wachowskis created a vast universe , very extravagant but cruel. In this universe the human race is ancient, very technologically advanced and if you are rich you can virtually be young and beautiful forever. Among the noble families the Abrasax family is the most powerful . After the violent death of their mother each of the 3 heirs received a part of the universe as inheritance . Earth is owned by the older brother Balem and is something like a cattle farm from where the people will be harvested to produce an eternal life elixir. Balem is hated and envied by his younger siblings that look for ways to diminish his fortune . The opportunity presents itself when on Earth the genetic reincarnation of their mother is discovered . Genetic reincarnations are rare but in event that this might happen the Abrasax matriarch left in her will the title to Earth to her future self.The visuals in this movie are outstanding and it has one the best use of 3D technology I saw in years, the action is fantastic, the costumes are stunning , there are soldiers spliced with animal DNAs and amazing ships and technology I wish someone can make reality (flying boots and wings).Mila Kunis and Channing Tatum have a good on screen chemistry but the dialog is awful, it makes you want to cover your ears.

The fact that they are capable of making an action movie with some philosophy in it without boring us to death (but i didn't see speed racer yet, it seems it the same kind of sad movie ). But here, it's like if someone took DNA of Lucas-CGI-best friend, split it with some Michael Bay-C4 cells, and mix it with a tiny bit of old Luc Besson's wardrobe from the 5th element. The result is terrible. If i watch it for the fun : it's messy at hell, action scene would require a map to understand who fight who or what. And when you understand it, you also understand that it's action scene in the middle of an empty city. You don't care they destroyed this cgi building or this cgi car. Characters are drop out of the blue with no logical reaction one to another or to what happened around them. No chemistry between them. If i watch it for some intellectual challenge, you got it : how did they make it to produced it without anyone saying : start the script over and decide to have some soul in it. Like in the Matrix or Cloud atlas, who got some theme inside. We can debate the ""how they deal with this theme"" if we want, but at least those movies got one. This one barely scratch the immortality or industrial way of life one, with a clear note of ""wanabe Dune all over again"". And before you have time to go further... action scene ! Excitement !

If you don't like it, move out and cater or something. Nevermind, seeing what Jup is unhappy about and then seeing a savior turning up to save her from it is simple minded indeed.

But it's a soap opera played out in a spectacularly grand scale in the far reaches of this universe and beyond.However you would like to describe it, one thing is for sure. This is a whole new world! The visuals were stunning. I've never seen planet earth look so pretty before. The greenery appeared greener than green, is that even possible? There was so much detail and attention spent on the colors and hues. The spaceships were beautifully crafted and designed like winged creatures. Each planet and location were unique with exquisite details.One of the first action scenes was a dream come true for me. It was such a realistic mix of the ""future"" set against the present. Jaw-dropping awesome! Though there were many characters involved and remembering their names was near to impossible, each character was visually distinct. Because of that, it was easy to differentiate the different factions and their underlings.But this is by no means a masterpiece. The biggest flaw is that there was just too much information condensed in the 2 hours. A new world was introduced but there was just not enough time to provide the details and back-stories needed. This led to a convoluted plot. However the central theme was clear to me. And that is probably why Jupiter Jones and her imperfect earthly family was so endearing to me.On a whole, I liked this movie much more than I expected. It's more enjoyable than the Star Wars prequels and even The Matrix. The Matrix was revolutionary but was serious and much darker in tone. This on the other hand is light-hearted, even tongue-in-cheek. Almost like a wink to us saying ""don't take it too seriously"". I'm glad I watched this on one of the largest screens possible.

I kind of have a chequered history with the Wachowskis. I loved Bound (a movie that should really be discussed a lot more than it is, and somewhat of a modern crime classic in my eyes), was a big fan of The Matrix (and also one of the 0.9% of the Earth who adored both sequels) and then lost some of my enthusiasm with the later projects bearing their name. It wasn't really until Cloud Atlas took me by surprise that I found my passion for their work again.Which brings me to this movie.There are a lot of things here that don't really work. Mila Kunis' performance here is about as bare minimum as you can get, and there were no real moments where I saw beyond the actress and found the character she was playing. That's somewhat of a problem when she's your lead. In fact, I engaged more with Tuppence Middleton's Kalique because that actress seemed so much more alive and vibrant in her role (and is also my new movie crush). Mila also didn't have a lot of chemistry with Channing which might have otherwise helped me get through the cringe-worthy romance sequence where she hits on him with the finesse of a drunk with a hammer. Yeah, that line about loving dogs didn't get any better outside of the trailer. The script is uneven. The editing is a bit wonky. Some of the humor didn't work.And yet I loved this!I've seen a few comments elsewhere that the back half of the movie isn't as solid as the first, which makes me (yet again) one of the minority. I loved everything to do with the intergalactic empires and space police. If anything, I wanted more of it. I don't understand a single thing about the planet where the final sequence took place but everything about that city's design fascinated me. I adored the look of the spaceships, and the dragon men, and the little minion who looked (and acted) like a rat. I love the fact that Sean Bean was a Bee-man simply because his splicer liked bees! And his swear word was ""Bee's wax""! I have my problems with the Abrasax family mainly because the other siblings stole time from Balem, but I enjoyed the concept of this alien family backstabbing one another for more life. It feels like something that could be spread across several novels.But, back to Balem. He was, by far, my absolute favorite thing about this movie. I've always been drawn to larger than life movie villains. It's a hard performance to master because most actors tend to go too broad and lurch into parody, but Eddie Redmayne was fantastic here. Whispering, and then SHOUTING, and then whispering whilst reclining on his chair; eyes glistening as though he'd just finished a mammoth crying session and a smile that continually popped up at the wrong time. I just wanted to shout out ""He's behind you!"" in the scene when he popped up behind Jupiter, as though I were in a pantomime. It's such a crime that we had so few scenes with him.Channing Tatum continues his redemption with me. I hated the guy when he first appeared on the scene, grew to like him with 21 Jump Street, and thought he was perfect here. It wasn't a particularly showy performance but, as the stoic Caine, I thought he completely sold the part of a canine hunter who was utterly relentless in pursuit of his prize.There so much I love here and it felt so good to see something that wasn't an adaptation or a remake, but a movie pulled from the imagination of two people and painted on the screen by their own hands. It makes me sad to hear that this movie isn't doing too well, as I'd love to see people in the film-making industry rewarded for, you know, making new stuff and doing it well. You have to wonder how an original piece of science fiction such as the first Star Wars movie might have fared today.Yes, Jupiter Ascending is flawed and some questions are left unanswered at the end (Jupiter saves the Earth but does she put an end to all harvesting, for instance?) but I kind of love the fact that a movie exists where a woman discovers that she's the Queen of the Universe and goes straight back to cleaning toilets; that she realizes how important family can be when they love one another, and that owning a planet means nothing if you're not a part of it.",Jupiter Ascending
539,jamesbrown1973,One of the biggest disappointments of the year,2,23 April 2015,"First let me say that I generally love complex sci-fi and that includes the Matrix trilogy but this was awfully conceived. It had a few good ideas but the cut/edit and dialogue was terrible. Eddie Redmayne was particularly poor with a badly mangled impression of Voldemort with the vestigial elements of Stephen Hawking - He seems a very limited actor. The plot was also very generic and flowed very badly due to the stilted predictable dialogue. I usually like both Channing Tatum and Kunis but this was far from their finest hour. The effects also seemed way below par, while some reminded me of the second Matrix film they felt quite dated. Overall I really wanted to like this but it was a big fail and only worth getting on bargain basket DVD rack.",Jupiter Ascending
540,acemacleod,Not as bad as reviewers make it out to be.,6,22 May 2018,"Sadly I fell for the bad reviews and bad press. Even the first time I tried to watch it I filtered it through the noise and didn't give it a chance at all. At $7.88 as a Channing Tatum and sci-fi fan I bought the blu-ray and gave it a chance. It's worth every penny of that. It's no Black Panther, but it's no Battlefield Earth either. It's more watchable than Dune, not as fun (or campy) as Starship Troopers, and either a low A or high B grade by my book. The story is no more or less complicated than other space operas. The pacing alternates well, and is above medium as a whole. Some scenes slow down but not as severe as some press stated.The special effects are pure Wachowski and fit the story. Bad special effects are exemplified by the almost 5 minute Enterprise fly by in 1979's Star Trek. There are many huge effects but they are not celebrated at the detriment of the story or pacing. Some have complained about trivia such as wings too small to support mass and I disagree with that sniping in general. We don't have gravity boots, dog men, bee Sean Beans, cannibalistic immortality potions or laser swords and nobody complains about those, so get over the wings. The character effects were better than most.The acting was well done. Eddie Redmayne was terrible in Fantastics Beasts. I wanted to scream look at the camera, look people in the eye! His being unrecognizable in this role is a compliment and Beasts may not have been his fault. His voice was less annoying than Bale's Batman but not a plus. I am not a Mila Kunis fan but she did well in this role. Sean Bean always lives up to his body of work and amazingly survived this film. At least the Wachowskis don't kill Starks when they get mad at fans. No one dominated like a Cumberbatch, Serkis, or Weaving but they all filled their roles. As a martial artist the fight scenes were as real as a dog man fighting a flying dinosaur could be. The attempt at realism versus CGI is evident. If you haven't, watch this. You may not buy it or rewatch it like a 14 year old in 1977 watching Star Wars, but it's worth any genre fan's time. For transparency I loved Valerian and am not a real fan of the last two Transformer's movies.",Jupiter Ascending

I absolutely don't like SPEED RACER, a CGI mess.JUPITER will provide excellent special effects: space, ships and cities. But you already expect this when you watch the trailers. The Story is very straight forward, and this, you also know it from the trailers. No headaches, just a story of princess. In fact, if you've seen the trailers, you've seen the movie.But unfortunately, the advantage of the trailers is that they avoid these long long discussions..God are they talking during this movie, they explain lots of things that are not very useful since the story is very simple. Not really a love story, not a space opera either..you don't know who's fighting who sometimes, and don't really care.My two girls (9/11) will probably enjoy the movie, maybe",Jupiter Ascending
542,realdimonty,One of the most disappointing sci-fi experiences I've had so far,3,12 February 2015,"OK, first things first.When I've watched the trailer for the first time, I think it was back in November. I said to myself: ""this has got to be a great movie for the beginning of the year"". As days went by, the trailer was played in every commercial moments before the start of the movies I went to see. So, I was more and more attracted to it. Yesterday was the big day. I went into the theater, grabbed some popcorn and sat comfortable to watch it. The start of the movie is lame. So is the next 30 mins. And so is the rest of it. Very poor acting by Mila Kunis. But it's not entirely her fault! Oh, no! The lines are so pathetic that I almost fell asleep. For everything that was happening she asked a stupid question, like she was 8 years old. ""Gosh, Mr. Badguy, you are going to kill me, aren't you?"" It's not out of the movie but is representative for her lines.The action scenes are long, predictable and boring. Two of the characters disappear without us understanding where they went, or why they had such a short appearance. I gave it 3 stars for the visual effects witch are the only decent things in it.Well, I guess I can go on forever with my bad impressions, but I will finish this with an advice: Do not, I repeat, DO NOT waste your money on this pathetic, boring piece of s**t!I honestly regret watching it!",Jupiter Ascending
543,amonjafarbay-50-730114,Disney is deeper,5,3 May 2015,"This movie gets 5 points purely for the recognition of the hard work that the special effects and post-processing team have clearly done on the film. Despite some great visuals this movie is a hollow piece of storytelling that plays out like a teeny twilighty trash-fest.Mila Kunis' face, beauty that it is, is the only thing that stopped me switching it off half way through. Channing Tatum looks absolutely ridiculous in this movie, looking just like a shirtless fairy from some Saturday night live send-up of a fantasy film, but it's not a joke. The costume designer really messed up here, and a lot of the visual aesthetic that does work seems to have been lifted from the Riddick movies (which I'm sure lifted them from somewhere else, like Dune).No pacing, a half-hearted script full of clunky exposition and childlike expressions of feeling and a crazy mix of tone, leaves you unsure if you're watching a flailing attempt at sci-fi epic or a cheap romantic comedy.

548,maclavian,Jupiter Ascending A Visual Feast And Thought Provoking,7,11 February 2015,"The criticism that the lead characters lack depth and the storyline becomes muddled is warranted but any criticism that the story is uninteresting comes from those with little imagination. This is a universe where corporations rule over various planets and the inhabitants of most of the planets are harvested in order to create a fountain of youth serum provided essentially to the ruling 1%. Earth can be sparred this horrific end only if Jupiter Jones prevails as the ""owner"" of Earth. You may not be so emotionally drawn into it but you do have reason to see Jupiter prevail, that is if you want the earth to survive. Along the way Jupiter Ascending weaves into it the notion of the purpose of alien grays and abductions along with a darker view of what a final harvest of the Earth means relative to many religious doctrines. The Christian version speaks of a final harvest where the great mass of people are cast into destruction except for a very few. This is consistent with the movie version except that in the movie the veneer of our religious version is cast aside for the harsh reality of the supposed real universe. This should be interesting for most inquisitive spiritual minds and those curious about the state of reality. In this sense the movie is in fact deep and thought provoking but certain critics just have no imagination to go there. Unless they haven't noticed 90 percent of the world's population is religious. You have got to love the Wachowskis desire to explore the possibilities of what is reality. That for me makes the movie extremely interesting. This movie is not only an exercise of the visual but also of the mind. It has it's detraction but the positive outweighs the negative. For that reason I give it a 7. Even if you don't find the movie interesting or profound you should have a lot of fun just watching it. That is worth the price of admission. For those that have the money to spare I would suggest the IMAX version at least once and get blown away. Enjoy!",Jupiter Ascending

550,TyTanner,The Wachowski siblings have tarnished their reputation,3,22 February 2015,"It's hard to imagine how the same directors and writers of the timeless Matrix movies and the bold and engaging endeavour that is Cloud Atlas can produce something as impotent and poor as Jupiter Ascending.Lana and Andy Wachowski shot to fame after releasing what has become a cult classic - The Matrix (1999). While Reloaded and Revolutions were never going to meet the standards set by the original film, they still formed a unique and memorable trilogy.Cloud Atlas (2012) was a brave project with a plot, soundtrack and visuals neatly described by one word: compelling. While it is based on a book (no originality), it remains thought-provoking and involved, keeping the viewer captivated and eager to watch it again after a digestion period of maybe five to six months.But with two recent flops in a short period of time (2008's Speed Racer and now Jupiter Ascending), you begin to question just how good Lana and Andy truly are at making films.Jupiter Ascending has one of the weakest protagonists you'll come across in a movie, a plot so unoriginal it makes 2013's Man of Steel seem innovative, non-existent character development and acting as laughable as Pierce Brosnan's SOS number in Mamma Mia (2008).A 'space opera' set in the modern day, alien dynasties living in far away galaxies bid to own planets, with Earth being one of the most valuable. The evolved inhabitants of these other planets are harvested to produce a youth serum which allows the other-worldly species to live for millennia after millennia.Jupiter Jones (Mila Kunis) lives on Earth, and is the reincarnation of the matriarch of the Abrasax family - the richest and most powerful empire of all the alien dynasties.The mother's will stipulates Earth be passed on to her genetic reincarnation, but her three children; Balem (Eddie Redmayne), Kalique (Tuppence Middleton) and Titus (Douglas Booth), all vie to claim it for themselves, thus having to capture Jupiter and find a way to take away her inheritance.In a classic Cinderella story, Jupiter, an innocent girl slaving away at a dirty job, is swept in to space by Caine; her knight in shining armour (Channing Tatum) - a genetically engineered hunter constantly saving Jupiter from impending danger. Destined to become a princess, she ultimately returns to Earth as the rightful owner (unbeknownst to all other humans living on Earth), as good triumphs over evil.An initially plain and boring protagonist, chosen to save the world - sound familiar? Also akin to The Matrix, the humans on Earth are used as 'batteries' to fuel the aliens/robots life - it appears the Wachowski siblings have truly run out of novel ideas.Kunis and all the other actors give expressionless and emotionless performances, looking to finish their jobs and get paid as quickly as possible.Eddie Redmayne, who plays Balem, has in recent roles forced the viewer to request subtitles to understand his dialogue. While an almost incoherent speaking voice was necessary to portray Stephen Hawking's debilitating disease in The Theory of Everything, why he was again cast with a barely understandable voice in Jupiter Ascending is beyond me, unless he thought it could score him another Oscar nomination?With unnecessary and possibly even insulting tributes to other movies such as Star Wars, Soylent Green, The Graduate, Star Trek, Back To The Future and Brazil, Jupiter Ascending deservedly turned over a poor $98.3 million at the box office, and holds a pretty spot-on rating of 23% with Rotten Tomatoes.Audience members and critics carry on about the cutting edge special effects and the visually stunning planet, city and other-worldly settings, but with a $176 million budget and access to today's CGI technology, is it really that impressive?When you're halfway through the film working out what time it will finish if it started at 9.50pm, you know the $28 spent on a ticket, medium popcorn and a Coke could have been put to better use. I've never walked out of a movie I've seen in cinemas, but I can count on one hand how many I would have liked to - Jupiter Ascending is the second, after Looper (2012).Lana and Andy Wachowski have seemingly damaged their reputation beyond repair. Jupiter Ascending makes us question their artistic value, and it can even force us to go back and re-evaluate their cult classic, The Matrix. Still one of the most boundary-pushing movies in recent history, were there other underlying factors which made it such a success?One theory, as noted by J. Wesley Judd (Can Jupiter Ascending change the way we feel about The Matrix? Feb, 2015), suggests The Matrix was so successful because the Wachowski siblings capitalised on the public's fear about a millennial apocalypse (of the year 2000), creating a film which portrayed a modern day dystopia society.That hypothesis certainly holds merit. Regardless, with action sequences far too long and lacking any commitment, Jupiter Ascending can be quickly cast aside, but certainly not forgotten (for all the wrong reasons).",Jupiter Ascending

I need to stop associating anything the Wachowskis make with the Matrix,because I fall under the illusion that the new material will have similar greatness and have thus far been severely disappointed (eg Cloud Atlas) 2. Sean Bean cannot salvage every below par film he is in, though he tries with honour worthy of Ned Stark 3. Mila Kunis is awesome at playing Mila Kunis 4. An Oscar winner can embarrass themselves just as well as non-Oscar winners 5. Channing Tatum has the acting capacity to be good, but also has the acting capacity to be very bad 6.

Well, one that isn't part of a Marvel franchise?"" And then Jupiter Ascending opened - and lo and behold, the Wachowskis delivered.I am old enough to remember having seen Flash Gordon and The Empire Strikes Back in the theaters. Space opera was very much an integral part of my childhood, and Jupiter Ascending is right there with some of the best I've seen.Then I heard all the negative reviews, and was baffled. Did these reviewers see the same movie I had? What happened? Do they hate fun? Is Chris Pratt the only one allowed to have fun in Hollywood anymore? Is it the fact that Jupiter Ascending has a female protagonist and caters to a female gaze? Maybe it's not specifically aimed at the dudebros to whom the Hollywood business machine seems to be pandering mostly these days, but they can still enjoy it nevertheless? Did the Hollywood suits see the Wachowski's jab at the corporate oligarchy and feel personally threatened? Are they still bumhurt that the Matrix sequels didn't quite live up to the original? Did seeing shirtless Channing Tatum/shirtless Eddie Redmayne make them feel all funny inside?

Music charm me. According to Wikipedia, it was conducted by Michael Giacchino, the same after the soundtrack to the film version of ""Speed ​​Racer"" (or Speed ​​Racer, also made by the Wachowski). He know is epic in its moments.But all else fails. Special effects, though it has many memorable moments, especially in the scenes in outer space, are generally irregular. For example, when using computer-generated funds are noticed kilometers computer and are in tune with the actors, or a ""bureaucratic office"" is too earthling to outer space.But what was the story less convinced. Part of the Matrix premise: that the world we humans know is ""false"" which are smaller than we think, we are being ""manipulated"" by superior forces. Matrix change robots alien humans, and use us as batteries by harvesting humans, and have an idea. It might have been good story, but it looks like (for me) too seen on Matrix, takes too long to explain the context, there is too much discussion and little action for a plot that does not deserve it, since neither far is as complex as they try to put it, or could be as epic as Matrix or science fiction sagas such as Star Wars.It is a film that I recommend if you go on television, used to hang out, but if you know the story of Matrix well, makes you think ""for something inspired by Matrix to regulate, for that see Matrix or hope its sequel"".

It is absolutely dreadful in almost every regard.To be sure, the Wachowskis must have started out with the best of intentions but a whole cascade of poor decisions, bad writing, lazy plot devices, rehashing their own ideas, uninspired casting and acting create some kind of wretched feedback loop that is the cinematic equivalent of watching a dog eat its own sick.The protagonist, Jupiter Jones is never in control of her own destiny being manipulated at every turn. She is a hostage to fortune at every stage of the film and needs rescuing time and again by the male lead and love interest. She is totally powerless and therefore virtually impossible to root for or cheer on.The male lead is a hunky slab of beef with zero charisma who scoots around on anti gravity Rollerblades, this looks as lame on screen as it sounds reading it to yourself. There is not one but three villains, two forgettable ones who could be dispensed with entirely and a main villain who is played by a very constipated academy award winner of all things. Does this improve anything? No.Sean Bean makes an appearance, yet we are denied seeing him die, a criminal waste of his main skill set as an actor. A Sean Bean death scene would have made for at least 2 minutes of compelling viewing.The only good sequence of the entire film was the 10 minutes it spent ripping off/pasticheing Terry Gilliam's Brazil. Gilliam himself makes a cameo appearance.The visual effects and world building are of very high quality, yet nothing revolutionary and they are standard fare for a film with a budget this big. All of this gets dulled through over use and bad editing that renders some of the action scenes difficult to follow, but at this point who really cares?

I'm certain she's been told too many times that she has ""pretty eyes"", because she refuses to change their expression. As such, she is posing, far, far more than ""acting"", throughout the entire film. In fact, I have yet to see her act, and this movie offers no new evidence.Kunis has zero emotional awareness, as many sociopaths might experience. If you can't feel emotions, and you want to act, this is the result, every time.Don't believe me? Watch her eyes throughout the movie; if you can bear the pain. I guarantee you, on a brain scan, her emotional centers are either stunted, or non-existent.Channing Tatum's not much better. He's more like watching a football or basketball player turned actor. Nothing going on, and his makeup is ridiculous, like someone dressed him up as their cute, pet emo-dog. The opposite of intimidating, and as equally expressionless as Kunis.If there is a fine line between homage and plagiarism, it was too fine for everyone involved to notice. Every idea you've ever seen, all the cool stuff from modern science, all the lines you've heard before, all the transitional scenes, idiotic catch-phrases, pauses for romance despite how ""in a hurry"" they are; it is a mash-up of too many ideas, with zero originality.They even stole Dragonlance's Draconians, for Fi's sake.Nothing new, everything old, badly acted, badly cast, terribly portrayed, and an absolute embarrassment for everyone involved.This is the job people won't want to keep on their resumes.This is the movie that puts you into Ghost Rider 2 territory.You will leave the theater feeling like someone pick-pocketed you.You will hate that the ""stars"" made any money for this crap.Avoid this movie, and laugh at anyone dumb enough to try and apologize by proxy, to justify that they didn't just waste 2 hours of their life.Stop supporting crap. Stop apologizing for rich, public figures that produce nothing useful to the human race. Stop giving your money to dumb-asses.176 million damn dollars was thrown away just making this thing.What a terrible machine, that can produce drivel on such a monstrous scale.The human race is friggin' doomed.Theater:No Stream:No Free:No Avoid Like Plague:Yes",Jupiter Ascending
563,martin-panda-svetlik,"generic story in spectacular visual effect, Jupiter Jones ???",6,5 August 2017,"The idea that planets are harvested for live-force, wasn't that Stargate: Atlantis? But the plot is rather sketchy, characters are not developing much. Visuals of the movie are pretty awesome though. I think they have one of the most beautiful wormholes I've seen, also the cities and dresses of the nobility are most charming. So in a way, this movie is like the Pacific Rim. Some generic story, and awesome visuals, and magic boots (instead of giant robots).And then there are the generic clichés - the girl cleans toilets, joke about DMV when doing intergalactic bureaucracy, girl and hero fall in love, blah-blah.But my biggest issue with this movie is: JUPITER JONES IS A BOY ! (friend of Bob and Peter). If you want to name the girl Jupiter for whatever plot purposes, at least use different surname than Jones. Now every time they say the name, I imagine the Other Jupiter in that situation (particularly wrong during the wedding...)",Jupiter Ascending
564,kyleweis,Jupiter Ascending,5,22 October 2015,"Jupiter Ascending, quite literally, is one of the most beautiful movies I have ever seen. The visual effects and CGI were top notch; nothing looked unfinished. Everything from explosions and action scenes, to space ships and settings, this movie had all the ""eye candy"" one could want. The fighting sequences were executed perfectly; each one thrilling in its own way. Each singular planet or world was so stunning and precisely crafted, that one could almost feel themselves in it. The Wachowskis have made a truly gorgeous universe in their latest movie.Michael Giacchino's music fits each scene very nicely whether it is a fast paced chase scene, or a quiet and thoughtful scene. It has a mysterious and almost hollow beauty to it, which fits this movie perfectly.Alas, not everything in this movie is as good as the visuals. Channing Tatum and Mila Kunis give surprisingly good performances for the most part but some of their acting is just off. The other principal actors give good performances as well but all the acting could have been taken a notch higher.Story and Plot is where this movie is weakest though. It has so much ambition and intricacy that it is to much to fit in a two hour long movie. Even though two hours is a good length, the plot just wants to keep on going and therefor the loose ends are never quite tied up. The plot is never really explained to its entirety and while one can figure out the general idea, it is hard to go deep into it. It has huge potential but rather than using it, it discards it. I give it credit for being fairly original though, and not a sequel, reboot, or based of a graphic novel or book. Originality is a great thing and the Wachowskis do it best.Overall Jupiter Ascending lacked plot depth and great acting abilities, but it won it all back with groundbreaking visuals. Even though many more big movies are coming out in 2015, this one would be one of the best for all we know. It may not be everyone's piece of cake, but it sure is a fun sci-fi adventure that shouldn't be forgotten.",Jupiter Ascending
565,abrarabeer82,A movie you can only watch to make fun of it and even than it becomes annoying,3,26 November 2016,"Jupiter Ascending is a movie that was made. This is probably one of the biggest mistakes made by Hollywood. But let's judge my own judgments for a bit now.Lilly Wachowski and Lana Wachowski - the sisters that directed all three of the Matrix movies and the Cloud Atlas movies made this. So by now you would think that their understanding of the space and time concept would be way better then any one else. But it isn't.The movie is full of cheesy lines and the most irritating ""What does it all mean"" moments. It is filled with actors over acting to make those cheesy lines work. Eddie Redmayne after signing on to 'The Theory of Everything' and 'The Danish Girl' decided to do this movie. But not just that. They got Mila Kunis, Channing Tatum and Sean Bean too!!! I gave them three stars just because they were able to get this cast to sign up for such a script. You might go into this movie thinking the cast might make things a little better. But they don't. Every single dialogue said with seriousness is laughable. You can tell your friends that this is a comedy and add some background music before you show it to them and they will say this is the best cheesy comedy ever.",Jupiter Ascending

To be fair even in our own bodies genes are never in the same exact order and are in a constant state of flux. Women in particular are chimeras as sometimes one x chromosome switches on, while the second x chromosome switches on in other cells. The sci fi genre audience is smart, and the story should be believable - but due to massive gaps in story it fells like its made for dumb people who want to just see action. The graphics are stunning, but character development is poor. Come on, the girl discovers advanced tech and knows how to use them intuitively? And why does everyone keep saving them, the premise of rebirth is so stupid. The earlier movie the cloud atlas atleast had some story even though the execution was lacking. The best the Wachowskis have done is the matrix trilogy, especially the first film. It has been downhill since. Enjoy the movie for graphics, its a one time watch and forget.",Jupiter Ascending
567,Justin-Kemp,Jupiter Asending - at 100 fps,3,23 April 2015,"This film was a much awaited picture for me due to the high rollers that made it the 'wachowski brothers' from the Matrix Trilogy's. Sadly it was a great big swing and a miss! the first action scene was enticing, then we saw warp-speed! each scene looked as though the animators were messing about showing what new scene toys they could throw at us. (the characters where all over the place, cant imaging what 3D would be like) The scenes seemed to be that of short show reels pieced together making it so hard to watch, If it wasn't for 'Mila Kunis' staring i wouldn't off. The eyes can only take so much i.e. 24fps not 100fps, its as if they where pulling off a magic trick trying showing you something in high speed so you don't know what just happened, (just some blurred space stuff) with an elephant driving a space ship, I know Star Wars has chewy but come on! Onto the story line; it's very mixed up, just throwing Mila from one planet to the next like a rag-doll fighting over her, a very weak plot indeed. The score was very typical and not anything new, and the casting was awe-full. I think they were trying for a 'guardians of the galaxy' type of film, which i much preferred. I stared this film a 3, 1 being 'Mila Kunis' is in it, 2 it was aesthetically pleasing during the slower scenes and 3 i was being generous with the extra star. JKemp",Jupiter Ascending
568,destructor-61011,A surprisingly good film,9,22 October 2017,"Though the film is confusing to begin one (and reason for losing 1 rating) when you get into it, it's a very good film. The beginning should explain more and give a short back story to the who's and why's. Because of the lack of, you find you'll spend the first 20 minutes head scratching and wondering what the hell is going on instead of enjoying the film.This will also put a lot of people off and no doubt has translated into such a low score.Here's hoping they do a directors cut and sort that issue out as this is definitely a film with sequels written all over it.Without ruining the film for anyone who hasn't yet seen it, if you enjoy sci-fi, along with a bit of romance, a lot of action and a few morals thrown in, you will enjoy this film.Acting, editing and directing are all top notch. Visually stunning though a few cgi moments does ruin the moment during a few scenes.Definitely deserves a second viewing (think The Matrix or Highlander and the ""uh?"" factor when you first saw them)",Jupiter Ascending

Mostly because I listened to all the negative reviews.When I finally watched it, I was delighted to see a movie that paid homage to old school science fiction while simultaneously elevating the genre as its known by modern standards.Jupiter is an amazing character. Not because she's some badass fighter or super genius. She not. She may the most ordinary character ever on the outside. But inside, what makes her different than most heroes, is her ability to empathize. That's right, the main character's only weapon in this film is empathy!I'm not surprised that such a masterpiece wasn't/isn't appreciated in its own time. Thank you for this amazing film Lily and Lana!",Jupiter Ascending

I know that is a low standard but we get so damn little in this genre to challenge us. I am already having nightmares on how bad FMA's Star Wars is going to end up. I want more, a lot more.

And I went in knowing it was going to be a terrible story, but maybe I would enjoy the special effects and action scenes. Unfortunately, a man-dog wearing eyeliner roller skating in the air fighting bad guys looks as ridiculous and dumb as it sounds. Mila Kunis felt completely miscast and had no chemistry with Channing Tatum, who was playing the same boring dumb hero he always does. The action sequences were a mess... impossible to tell what was going on.I watch a lot of movies and have only walked out on a handful in my life, but I could not make it through more than 70 minutes of this ridiculous film.

It's kinda campy, but in an endearing way that feels very consistent with the genre. I loved the little nods to sci-fi classics.The visuals are incredible. Their artistic choices were spot on, start to finish. The movie deserves a high rating on that alone. The aerial battle scene over Chicago is one of my favorite sci-fi battles ever.They did an excellent job creating a universe that I want to know more about. It feels like there is a rich backstory to each character and location. It's a world that seems ripe for further exploration.It's held back by middling dialogue and unexceptional performances from some of the leads. Mila Kunis' Jupiter just felt stiff as a character and Channing Tatum's Caine was clearly intended to come off as stoic, but ended up just being kind of boring. I'm still not entirely sure if I love or hate Eddie Redmane's performance as Balem Abrasax.I want more of this, but as a TV show spinoff, not a sequel with these characters (not that I'll be holding my breath).",Jupiter Ascending

574,kappelmeier,What a waste of time/Warning: Spoilers,3,6 June 2016,"OK, the movie is visually stunning but one kind of expects that from the Wachowski siblings. A lot of the reviews show that nearly everyone was impressed, some even gave the move 7 stars only for the visuals. That I can't understand. You don't watch a movie for 2 hours just because of the CGI. I gave the movie 3 stars only for the visuals. There should be a at least a little bit of a convincing plot and actors who can actually act. I somehow made it through the whole two hours but that's two hours of my life I will never get back. To think that I even considered buying the Blu-ray makes me shiver. I saw it on German pay-TV, so it was included in my subscription. After about 30 or 40 minutes into the movie I kind of prayed that someone would kill off the main characters and the story would evolve with Sean Bean as the leading man. His talent was absolutely wasted. Channing Tatum - I've never yet seen a movie that convinced me he has even remotely some talent as an actor. Most of the times I couldn't bring myself to watch his movies until the end. Now I know it was the right decision. Mila Kunis - it was the first movie with her that I saw and she looked like she wanted to be somewhere else or she just didn't care about her performance. SPOILER: And the ending - sure, after all I saw and went through all I want to do is go back to earth and scrub some stranger's toilets again??? I really hope they don't think about a sequel. That money should be invested otherwise. My advice - just don't watch that annoying movie. Still feel sorry for Sean Bean, he's one of my favorite actors.",Jupiter Ascending
575,dehickey,Flawed Film with interesting concepts.,6,10 February 2015,"The biggest failure of Jupiter Ascending is in the choice of leads and the poor job done of exposition. Too much of the exposition in the movie is done via mumbling or overly breathy dialogue that forces the viewer to strain to try and understand what is being said.Mila Kunis and Channing Tatum were simply out of their depth in this one. Mila's character Jupiter never REALLY fits into the movie one way or another and while I like Mila, her acting talents are more suited to comedy or supporting roles. Tatum seemed to have a really difficult time making his character into something that was cohesive and he just came off as flat and uninspired.All that said, I applaud the Wachowski's for continuing to try and bring new sci-fi to the big screen. While the underlying themes of the film are not new, the film itself had the fresh and unique feel of something that might have been inspired by Dune or The 5th Element- two other films that attempted to break the mold for sci-fi and have ultimately found a lasting audience despite somewhat lacklustre box office performance.The special effects are phenomenal in the film and the concept of Tatum's character's boots was really unique and incredibly well executed in the film.Check it out if you like sci-fi but don't expect to fall in love with the characters.",Jupiter Ascending
576,Das-Virus2002,"Rich, fascinating and grossly underrated",9,8 February 2015,"Whenever the Wachowskis are releasing a movie, there will be massive debates over their work. While many critics claim that they have grown worse and worse ever since releasing ""The Matrix"" in 1999, I usually tend to disagree and enjoy their movies at least to a certain extent.To be fair, one has to acknowledge that with the Wachowskis you will always get ""unique"" movies insofar as that they will certainly not be to everyone's personal taste. This is due to the fact that these two produce creative movies that are, usually, one-of-a-kind and seem to be too complex and intellectual for the mere popcorn fraction - but not compelling and progressive enough for the purely intellectual audiences.However, my personal opinion is that with Jupiter Ascending, the Wachowskis hit it out of the ballpark, if I may use this sports metaphor.JA is a fascinating movie full of gorgeous cinematography with not only breath-taking CGI, but some rather artsy camera angles and dolly shots. On the whole, the art department of JA completely nailed it. You see spaceships containing solar arrays that could have been taken directly from one of Leonardo Da Vinci's inventions. You see worlds so believable and distinctively unique that you feel they could really exist (unlike the overly conceptual world in James Cameron's 2009 blockbuster ""Avatar"") and the whole universe created by the Wachowskis feels - plausible. I have not experienced this effect in a Sci-Fi- movie since I first watched Star Wars.The acting was believable throughout the movie, and I felt Channing Tatum and Eddie Redmayne did a great job portraying their respective characters especially. Tatum's haunted looks and body language fit his character nicely while Redmayne's character really came across as bipolar and sinister as that of the Dark Emperor in Star Wars.The story itself is much more complex than most reviews give it credit for: it is not only about the former cleaning lady Jupiter Jones (Mila Kunis) getting to know she is the reincarnation of an industrialist who owned large portions of the known universe. It is not only about mankind not rooting from planet Earth (though I liked to see the scientific theory of Panspermia being implemented). It is not only about genetic engineering and the ""splicing"" of genomes in order to artificially create perfect soldiers, spies etc. It is not only about a gender reversal of ""The Matrix"", as Jupiter discovers the true nature of mankind's history, the Earth and her role as being chosen - it is about all of this and then some.There have been so many intertextual references in this movie, so many aspects of human life that have been explored at least peripherally (dare I say that the scenes regarding interstellar bureaucracy were incredibly funny and presented a vivid social criticism of nowadays' system?) and even quite a few winks at actual scientific theories, that it astonished me none of the critics ever cared writing about them. One example of the Wachowskis' subtle implementation of scientific matters (or rather, playing with these) is the scene in which Jupiter is brought to Stinger's home by Caine. Stinger, who has been genetically ""spliced"" and is partly bee-esque, had to retire from his military duties at Aegis, the interstellar military force, and now lives his life as an apiculturist on the outskirts of Chicago. As Jupiter joins the scenery, all of the bees suddenly fly around her and appear to be defending her from whatever (or whoever) comes close to her. As Stinger explains, bees can instinctively feel royalty in a living being and bows down on his knees as he addresses Jupiter, ""Her Majesty"". Cain, as well as Stinger, did not know about the details of their orders beforehand and thus have not had any idea that Jupiter was the reincarnation of the matriarch of the Abrasax family, who reigns supreme over vast parts of known space. Keeping that in mind it definitely reminds one of Einstein's theories of mankind becoming extinct as soon as the bees have died out. Granted, Einstein's chain of events foresaw the bees going extinct leading to less plants eventually leading to our extinction. However, in this case, bees have helped (Terran) mankind to survive. Had it not been for them would Caine and Stinger have brought Jupiter to her sibling Titus Abrasax, who would have killed her after marrying her in order to receive the Earth as his heritage thus enabling him to ""harvest"" the planet. This ""harvest"" is, eventually, the central element of this movie even though it is never shown. As it was stated by Jupiter's sister, Kalique Abrasax, whole planets are harvested in order to liquefy their inhabitants and gaining a fluid that enables those who bath in it a regeneration of their cells on molecular basis – a fountain of youth, if you will, and yet another intertextual reference. Google ""Siegfried"" for more information.The only criticism I tend to agree with is that JA might have been overly ambitious for a movie only weighing in at roughly two hours of screen time. There are numerous plot lines within this movie, and not all of them are picked up and interwoven cleanly at the end of Jupiter Ascending. This is, however, not a real problem, as JA can perfectly stand as a one-piece movie in itself. Adding to that is the notion that JA might be explored as a completely new franchise for WB and the Wachowskis, thus enabling the missing information to be included in a potential sequel.I do not understand why people criticize Jupiter Ascending so strongly, as this movie is, at least to my belief, the most complex and well-rounded Sci-Fi-flick since the first Star Wars movie came around in 1977. I rate this movie with 9/10 stars.",Jupiter Ascending

It felt like another one of those cheesy superhero films with WAY TOO DAMN MUCH CGI, bad acting, bad writing, plotlines that go nowhere, cringey jokes, etc. It just didn't lean as much on the superhero side of things as the others.The people rating this highly seem to perceive this as a classic, I even saw one person compare this to Blade Runner...

578,gorilazed,The amazing soundtrack and sci-fi world in this film are what's making it worth to watch,7,13 February 2015,"Let's face it. When people heard The Wachowskis were writing and directing this film they probably expected something deep and astonishing as the Matrix trilogy. It's inevitable. The name Wachowski is surely imprinted in every sci-fi fan's mind in green letters over a black background. Nevertheless, there's nothing green about Jupiter Ascending (JA).This film has quite an ambitious plot, which only seems right, for the universe it takes place in is extremely well built and imagined, something to be expected from The Waschowskis. The special effects are very good but hardly near the best I've ever experienced. I still believe that the excessive use of CGI, although it allows more fluid action sequences, it doesn't seem as real as some old school special effects (take for example Star Wars episodes IV, V and VI and compare them to I, II and III). The ideal would be a mixture of the two methods. In JA all the alien equipment, such as spaceships, weaponry and every day tools, are very out of the ordinary and quite pleasant to the eye. However, looking for example at the Chicago fight scene, the complex shape of the aircrafts, the way they fly and their constant 'shapeshifting' just make the action seem confusing and hard to keep up with. At some points it just feels unrealistic, even considering who's fighting, and I'm almost sure that a skinny human like Jupiter (Mila Kunis) should have died during that scene considering she was whiplashed and thrown around all over the place. The human spine can only take so much. Furthermore, I felt that every action scene was very repetitive with Caine Wise (Channing Tatum) always saving Jupiter at the last millisecond. Seriously, it happened maybe around 5 times.But the main problem of the film is it's characters. The film starts feeding us right from the bat a lot of sci-fi info, which at the beginning is a little hard to keep up with but later on, if one was paying close attention, it all starts to make sense. But then one notices that there isn't really any character development throughout the film. They are in summary one dimensional characters. As such, there is no way the audience, or at least me, could feel any attachment to the character. Aditionaly, some of the dialog is just some old cliché lines such as 'I always fall for the wrong guys' among others. Cain Wise, the supposed hero of the story, is a character whose only purpose is to kick some butt. He has a past, which is poorly fed to the audience. I don't believe Tatum is a bad actor but the truth is that he keeps on taking roles that require little dramatic acting. Even being one of the leading actors in the nominated Foxcatcher, he played a muscle bound gorilla with very few lines compared to his co-stars. However, Eddie Redmayne's acting was just from a whole other league and I truly believe if the story had focused a little more on him and had further developed his character's past, we could be witnessing another Oscar acting nom (also if the film had been released in a more friendly award nomination season). Also, I believe the other members from the Abrassax family had a decent portrayal of their characters but once more we didn't really get to know them. Mila Kunis plays her usual self, but I don't really care for her character. Mainly due to reasons I stated before, but also I would have preferred a more serious character. For example, her quirky narration at the beginning just doesn't go with the epicness of the OST's intro.Overall a good film to pass the time, but unfortunately it will never be a classic. Although tempting, don't watch it expecting something like the Matrix. If you want to compare it with a film of it's kind maybe compare it with the Star Wars movies but Jupiter Ascending can't even see their greatness considering how far it is from them. It's universe however has a lot of potential and I would surely watch if there happened to be a sequel. I do hope there'll be one, and if so with a better plot revolving around it's characters, whoever they may be. In the end, I just want to say that the film's soundtrack is something out of the ordinary. I definitely consider it a piece of original classical music. It's surely one of the main reasons I gave the film such a high rating.",Jupiter Ascending
579,meelahi,"Good concept, terrible execution",5,28 May 2015,"At conceptual level, Jupiter Ascending tackles some very basic aspect of science fiction with ease. Generally Sci-Fi movies have to be taken with a grain of ""galaxy far far away"", so that they don't have to clash with the reality of real world. But this movie deals with that quite easily. But unfortunately the good part ends there.The other aspects of Jupiter Ascending is plagued by bad screenplay, which relegates the movie to the level of a low budget ""rescue the princess"" movie, worse than acceptable acting, and a similar standard of directing, which failed to stitch together the parts of the movie. At times it felt like it was two movie running back to back, where the first part making it as an acceptable one due to the concept of the movie, the second part made me wanna run away.If you have nothing better to do, watch the movie.

580,lynrdavis,Awesome SciFi Film - Worthy of Cult Classic,9,22 June 2017,"Jupiter Ascending explores the value of time to each of us through the eyes of the narrator/heroine, Jupiter Jones, and the various characters she encounters, from her family, to her kidnappers, to the space royalty that invade earth to manipulate her influence on their management of the commercialization of selling substances to prolong lifei.e. extend time. The Wachowskis have created a gem of a film with layer upon layer of textures, if you take the 'time' to see them. They are easy to miss, as apparently many have. Jupiter Ascending drew me in with the spectacular worlds and visual feast of exploding action. Already a fan of Channing Tatum, Sean Bean and Eddie Redmayne, I now add Milas Kunis to my list and many other character actors because of this film. I don't mind Redmayne's over the top version of Belam. The latter's a royal who is more full of himself than any one on earth. Affect in speech accentuates his self-aggrandizement. That reveals more about Belam than Eddie. Give Eddie the credit for knowing what he is doing; Lily and Lana, too. I chuckle at the reviews that disparage this film, because all I hear when I read them, is that they missed many aspects of it. The start of the film foreshadows the theme: the question is how do you spend your time and do you appreciate the time you have? Staring at stars through a telescope, the father spends his time on his passion and with the love of his life, which produces the child—who becomes the reincarnation—or recurrence, as they call it, of the mother of a royal family vying for the greatest resource in the 'verse' or universe: time. They live for thousands of years by 'harvesting' humans and bathing in the extract, thus expanding their 'time' indefinitely. Time is more valuable than gold or anything we have on earth. We don't value it because we don't think we can trade it, like we can gold. But the Wachowskis are going to show us differently. Early on we see Jupiter Jones despising her life and every moment—time— of every day. She is kidnapped by the three heirs respectively. They use our hero Caine Wise (Tatum) who joins forces with Stinger (Sean Bean) to save Jupiter again and again. The relationship between the men alternates between fighting their old personal battles, rejuvenating their long-time friendship and healing a betrayal. The initial attraction between Caine and Jupiter is strained shortly after they meet because of the extreme differences between stations of royalty and 'lycantant-splices.' If the Wachowski sisters failed here, it was that they didn't make the case that Caine has no standing in the order of things. We don't sense that Jupiter would have any resistance in falling for Caine because Jupiter really doesn't care about being royalty. She can more easily convince Caine who puts up little in resisting Jupiter. But that is really minor. Overall, I loved the flying and the fight scenes. I work-out to them and find my footsteps and heart rate always increase with them easily— Thank you, Lana and Lily! You rock, just as you did in the Matrix! Unlike so many of the complainers, I have watched this again and again. Each time I watch it, I notice nuances I missed before. As with all of the Wachowski works, they have so many layers, there are more things to look forward to. The potential for more stories are endless. I hope they will write many more stories from these worlds. And I haven't got to the tertiary characters etc. Captain Diomika Tsing (Nikki Amukka-Bird) commands not only the space ship, but the screen with her presence. Look forward to more of her in future work by the Wachowskis. Bird brings women of color and gives them authority and assertiveness without being nasty. She rocks. Advocate Bob (brilliantly played by Samuel Barnett—MUST see more of him) and the Bureaucrats (John Locke, Sarah Crowden) are laugh out loud funny. I adore Advocate Bob's chipper excitement and progressive frustration with the process of the paperwork. The 'Be thankful the Time spent at the DMV is not worse theme' is clearly stated by Jupiter. Bob makes it hilarious. The end of the film brings the theme to its conclusion—not with the happily ever after moment, but with the growth of Jupiter Jones, who started out hating her life, and ends appreciating every moment—even cleaning toilets for the rich and making coffee and fixing breakfast for her mom and aunt. When the family gathers, they present Jupiter with a telescope, showing that they have grown—no longer seeing her as a girl only meant to marry but as someone, whose interests have merit. Jupiter's life has changed. She owns the earth, but she has opted for its change to be incremental. She is taking her time to enjoy it. Time again. After all time flies when you are having fun, just as she is flying with Caine at the end. Time and fun are joined together in flight. The Wachowskis are brilliant. No surprise that many can't see it or the many layers. The layers are blessed with Michael Giacchino's music. He is one of this century geniuses when it comes to music scores. He matches the drama and the humor, every ebb and flow. If I could write screenplays, I would want him scoring all my work.

Because if had ever attempted anything other than watching and dissing other people's works, you would realize the depth of thought, imagination, and energy that were devoted to this movie.This is a creative and entertaining jaunt into an alternate reality. A work of speculative fiction that anyone who loves scifi will enjoy. ...Well unless they are spoiled, jaded, and just love to find any tiny fault to denigrate a work of love. Seriously, I would hate to watch movies with most of you. I watch movies for enjoyment, to escape and live in the creator's mind for a n hour or two.

And then I watched it and I wasn't as disappointed as I expected to be. The acting was not exactly brilliant: the actors didn't always make me feel the intensity of the action or the drama, but I have seen a lot of movies and this is not a 5/10. I hope I'm not breaking any guidelines by saying that I enjoyed this movie more than I ever enjoyed any of the Twilight movies, and they have the same damn score. The story is really interesting and the effects are decent (I really couldn't find anything wrong with them, as some reviews state, but I suppose it's more of a thing of taste).

The story is boring, awful and you lose interest in the first 20 minutes; F/X seemed unconvincing or cheesy in some areas. I kept thinking how come you're shooting up a city, buildings, cars- yet you don't see a single soul either taking pictures, looking scared, running etc.

Ridiculous. It's like they didn't have enough time and condensed it into a thinly veiled succession of boss fights. (And with too much music, IMHO.)Come on! The Hobbit is made into (what they call) a trilogy, but this epic journey - both personal and through the vastness of space - is done with in two hours?

Russian family mugged, baby born in the sea, alien abducting, false impersonation for egg donating... WHAT? The film fails at everything. They make a very poor attempt at trying to create a love story between the royal and the peasant which fails horrendously.Overacting plagues this film. The worst offender is this soft spoken guy who killed his mother. The whole film he is whining. He's a horrible character and the role is given to a horrible actor.I hate this film. I saw it for free and honestly wish I saw the Spongebob movie instead. I knew this film would suck since every movie The Wachowski's have made since the first Matrix has sucked.

591,dgls_lwsn,Truly uninspiring,4,23 April 2015,"A seemingly endless budget and big-name actors does not a great movie make. And that was surely the story of this entirely forgetful tale. For the life of me, I can't tell whether it was the incredibly mediocre plot, dreadful dialogue, or downright bad storytelling that really took the cake here. All three made their case and were all very good at convincing me to stop watching, but I plodded on against all odds and am proud to say I watched the whole thing. Every last, painfully maculate bit.To give you just a hint of what you could (and really should) do without, I'll add a sliver of specificity to my complaints. Oft times the audience would find itself charmed by an acute detail, and perhaps make note of it -- ""Goodness, what an interesting idea!"" -- only to be greeted by disappointment at the end of the movie when none of the interesting bits came to fruition. It was either the script writers or the editors, but somebody had their way with this film and gutted it down to the bare bones, leaving merely scraps for the audience to cling to for the entirety of the film.As mentioned, Mila Kunis and Channing Tatum are certainly big-name actors. They performed well enough. Was either performance particularly deserving of praise? No. They delivered their cliché lines in unremarkable fashion. I can't say I blame them for the general atrocity; acting was hardly the problem, after all. While I have no small amount of respect for the Wachowskis, this movie is a far cry from their earlier masterpieces. Perhaps more painful than the film itself was the story it proved incapable of telling. Thinking of the potential, the movie and story that could have been, is nearly agonizing. Would I recommend this movie to a friend? Sure. If I felt like I really needed to get back at them for something terrible they'd done to me in the past.",Jupiter Ascending
592,opointe,Creativity... Well off the scale!,7,10 May 2015,"Creative endeavors are without a doubt, a challenge, some of the hardest parts of artistic enterprise. Well this movie delivers. Rarely has a movie been so creative: universal plot, raw visualiality (add that to your dictionary). The movie encompasses an external force that can actually harvest humans, for profit, imagine that. The possible savior is a young woman, bound by conscience and her family. Her accomplice, always by her side, is a genetically enhanced human, half wolf of some galactic type, who comes from an ultra-enhanced-military-genetically centered-alien world, who comes to save her...for the bounty. She like him, gives way to the wolf centered side, which prevails over 'conservative' ritual and their induced mayhem. Well, as you can see, this is creative movie, to say the least.Much is made of various factions dominating the universe, including mothers and their sons and their titles, along with genetic reincarnation. It all affects the earth and the quite fragile and vulnerable population.Creativity, loads of it, complexity within a universe of concern, is dominated by the love interest that develops with the human/wolf, something I have been a fan of, right here on earth, with wonderment, for years. This 'love interest' gives way towards the end, leaving me wondering what may 'come out' for the royal and 'enhanced', as depicted in the end, in any future installment!

593,mat-dragonfire,Awesome Looking Movie,7,27 February 2015,"Jupiter Ascending is one visually stunning movie and not at all disappointing, considering how many bad reviews it has received. Basically, the movie revolves around Jupiter Jones, a human girl, born on Earth which is a small part in a bigger plot of one of ruling families in the universe. Jupiter is, through her genetic legacy, an heir to the aforementioned family and has to protect herself, as well as her planet, from other members of this family. The movie sports a huge variety of space travel and planets, all of which were amazingly done. All worlds, as well as their residents were depicted perfectly. Even more so, that you would feel, as if you were right there. The music was also unique and pleasant and fits perfectly to each scene. Mila Kunis and Channing Tatum have both portrayed their roles of Jupiter Jones and Caine Wise respectively quite good, even though there is a lot more space to improve on. Unlike them, Eddie Redmayne portrayed his role of a royal antagonist and a snob perfectly. The other actors I won't comment on because their roles and acting didn't really show that much in the movie. And that brings me to negative aspects of this movie. The story, although impressive and intriguing, lacks its ending and character development. There is much more ground for this story to build on but the movie left it somehow unfinished and that may be one of the main reasons why the movie wasn't so well accepted by the audience so far. Considering the Wachowskis are notorious for having good but long stories, the ending doesn't surprise me. All in all, a neat jewel for your eyes, if that is what defines your good movie but if you don't have a good imagination or like a more insightful story, then this is definitely not a movie for you.",Jupiter Ascending

Mila Kunis does an excellent job as reluctant royalty and it's refreshing to see Eddie Redmayne playing pure evil rather than a brooding or fumbling anti-hero. And it throws in some humor in the mix too.if you expect it to be any other type of movie, you'll be disappointed, but if you enjoy *any* Star Wars movie, The Fifth Element, Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets or any other silly space opera, you should certainly allow yourself to like this one.",Jupiter Ascending

There was TERRIBLE acting and 2 scenes of action and each was like 20 minutes long instead they should have had many different action scenes that were like 5 mins each.

598,frarandone,The worst cinematographic delusion of my life,5,15 February 2015,"I've been waiting for this film for ages, wondering what wonderful new universes the Wachowskis had created this time. I've been imaging breath-taking stories, like the Cloud Atlas ones, epic characters, like V and astonishing universes, such as in Matrix.All I got was great special effects. Really great ones, I have to admit that, like when a whole planet is going to catch fire and it seems you can reach the flames. This is the only reason I would save the setting. And also the action scenes are worth to be remembered, even if sometimes they are just taken for granted.Despite this, I think this is going to be the worst cinematographic delusion of my life for a very long time. Let's start from the plot: a good idea, there are no doubts about it. What if human life didn't start on Earth but on another planet and developed to the point that it has conquered the universe and uses other planets as living factories? And what if an inhabitant of the Earth, that has never hoped for anything better than selling her ovules to buy a telescope, finds out that she is going to inherit a couple of planets? But once you have a good idea, you have to vehicle it in the right way, and above all, make people feel emotionally involved in it. In this case nothing of this has happened. The great emotional potential of Jupiter's and Caine's stories is wasted because of lame dialogs and a bit too many action scenes. And it's better to forget some quotes that led me to consider this the worst-built love-story I have ever seen. Moreover, what should probably be the main theme, the importance of time and how humans should deal with it, is not showed in an original way. All the movie is focused on the action so there is no space to develop the message properly, as it has been done in many other Wachowskis' films.The lack of depth of the characters is a direct consequence of how the story is told. You just don't grow fond of them because you are not involved in their personal stories when you find them out. They are played on interesting feelings but badly conveyed. Maybe characters just don't have enough space in the whole movie to develop their personalities, but I would rather say that the space they are given is badly used. In conclusion, if you are hoping to see great special effects you will probably be completely satisfied with this film. If you are expecting anything else just forget it.",Jupiter Ascending

The characters are lifeless and the logic has too many flaws.The visual effects are good, but not flawless. I could notice the difference in contrast between the actors and the background in a couple of scenes which really bummed me out. I expected better visual effects. But even if they were flawless, they could not have saved the movie. All in all, they are good, so the movie gets one more point for that.Final point goes to the actors themselves.

600,PatheticCinephile,Painful and that is it.,1,20 June 2017,"I will start my review by saying one thing...DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE!!! I know it looks really great and it was made by the Wachowski Brothers and they made The Matrix which was one of the best sci fi films ever made. Sadly though after making a movie going in the territory of Terminator 2 and other great sci fi films they have slipped into Battlefield Earth territory. Okay maybe this movie is not as bad as Battlefield Earth but it is almost as unwatchable. This movie didn't just bore me with uninteresting characters and a too multi-layered plot but it angered me with its sense of not wanting to be original in any way. Some of the aspects of films it ripped off were so noticeable that I think the directors just copied those aspects. Sometimes these aspects were major parts of the movie and that easily could annoy anyone who loved the movies they ripped. Anyway originality or not aside the film is also very poorly acted by Mila Kunis, Channing Tatum and(I am not joking here) EDDIE REDMAYNE of all Oscar winners. The characters are boring and uninteresting and it doesn't help that the movie doesn't really seem to be trying to make it interesting. The plot is mixed and at times in some way repetitive and hard to follow. The concepts were sometimes in a way promising but never delivered anything interesting. I also felt that Mila Kunis's character, Jupiter Jones(Yes that is her name), was very weak and always needed saving. Overall Jupiter Ascending is probably one of the worst sci fi films ever for being not original, terribly written and lazily acted which easily gives it a 1/4.",Jupiter Ascending

Really awful.Some of the dialogue is quite frankly daft, it's like a high school student has been involved.

602,darrengee,OK but lacking something,6,11 May 2016,"On the Earth a down trodden Cinderella type is trying to earn enough money from her cleaning job to buy a telescope in honour of her father who named her Jupiter. She's persuaded to go to sell her eggs to a fertility clinic, which is where things start on the path to adventure. She's targetted by aliens and rescued by a handsome dogman, who is actually a bounty hunter working for one of the members of a powerful Galactic family.Earth and a multitude of other worlds are actually owned by a Borgia-like royal family. Their purpose is to seed planets with human beings ripe for harvesting to produce an anti aging elixir using the DNA of said humans. The matriarchal head of this family gets murdered and three siblings are left to squabble over this huge corporation profiting from the DNA harvest. Jupiter is fought over as she's discovered to be Genetically identical to the late matriarch, and so she can claim her place as the Queen. The rival siblings all want her as she can decides who inherits the family business.The film crams all this in, but although it's two hours it feels like it's rushing this. Disciphering all this from the virtually whispered dialogue amongst the confusing and overly fast paced action sequences meant watching it twice. Planetary seeding isn't a new idea, and having alien races controlling the Earth is old news for the Area 51, UFO believers. So having this as the plot didn't offend me, I thought it was a good idea and rather original as opposed to the usual Independence Day invasion stories. There's a couple of things I didn't get, namely how all the DNA was tracked, was all the DNA from clones? It was intimated that this was reincarnation by the female sibling after the rejuvenating skinny dip. Plus it was also said that the human DNA was spliced with some of the native species after the dinosaurs were culled, if so how could Jupiter be the perfect genetic clone of the Queen as the humans on Earth have only existed for 100,000 years. This DNA isn't pure by default. Secondly if this family is all so powerful and ruling, who runs the military and why does it exist?The SFX were good, the Gothic inspired space settings were reminiscent of playing Warhammer 40,000 or watching the 80s classic Flash Gordon! Characters were rather shallow and stereotypical. With the dishonoured soldier who doesn't fit in, the trustworthy old friend who turns traitor but for a good cause, saving his daughter, and then comes good, the incestful sibling craving power etc etc.An OK movie which really needed to be a little longer to take more time to explain things properly. It could've been a little more intellectual and visceral but ended up just being a lot of set action pieces linked by a Terminatorish plot secondary to the action, with Mila Kunis like Sarah Connor just along for the ride.",Jupiter Ascending

All I knew about her came from the tabloid media's coverage of her teeney-bopper romances with other teen heart throbs. She surprised me by how well she could act. It was an engaging performance that carried the film, which overall wasn't that great. Too many new science-fiction films over rely on cgi-special effects and poorly placed 'action' events. Fortunately, when you watch a movie on DVD you can fast forward through the tedium of overly long scenes of explosions, gory battles, etc. It doesn't give anything away to note that there is a Cinderella theme in the plot.

604,PopcornLobotomy,It's just a disappointing mess,1,5 April 2016,"Note: This is a text version of my Popcorn Lobotomy Scathing Review video:(The video review is much more fun)Do you remember those BTS interviews on the original Matrix DVD? In then, the Wachowskis stated that every idea they had ever had was in that one film.Well, I guess they took a similar approach with Jupiter Ascending, except this time time they appear to have gotten their ideas from a homeless, alcoholic paranoid conspiracy theorist who was presumably paid in capfuls of methylated spirits and a lifetime supply of tin foil.I mean, the movie contains grey aliens, reptilians, humans as food, and the kind of over-arching alien world domination agenda that it feels ripped right out a particularly paranoid David Icke lecture.I enjoy watching Mila Kunis on-screen, but her character, Jupiter Jones, wears a permanent ""resting bitch face"" for most of the film and is generally a humourless bore. She's a complete passenger throughout, and when she finally sparks up a bit due to finding out she's a royal, she's such a condescending ass about it that it makes her even less likable.Then we've got Caine, played by Chafing Scrotum, her sworn loyal protector whose job it is to save her over and over and over and over and over and over again! This dude is a genetically spliced half-alien-half-dog fallen angel trying to earn his wings back with some really natty plasma rocket boots that enable him to do pretty much anything he likes, physics be damned!For a character who's supposedly more than 50% genetically canine, he sure looks pretty human to me. Apart from getting the make up department to prick his ears up and glue a few tufts of Nicole Kidman's pubic hair to his face, Chandler Tinytim does a pretty terrible job of coming across all dog-like.How about a bit of panting, leg-lifting, confused head-tilting, or even pooping the bed and looking guilty about it, eh, Tatum?Eddie Redmayne turns in a bizarre performance as the main bad guy. Seriously, he sounds like an old man getting oral service from a high class hooker, but is so off-his-face drunk from over-indulging in cheap port that he's unable to come – I guess that's the reason for his random outbursts of extreme insane anger.So if you like lazy explanations, bizarre tonal shifts and inappropriate sexual complexities you might like Jupiter Ascending.And it's a shame, you know... Original sci-fi. We need more of it. We should encourage it.But is it really original? I mean yes the overall story hasn't been told this way before (thinking there's a good reason for that) but I found myself getting an explicable sense of De Ja Vu throughout this yawnfest.Honestly, perhaps it's time to consider the idea of removing The Wachowski LGBTs as our figureheads of original sci-fi and give the mantle to someone with talent and good taste?

However, There is a hidden message behind the whole sci-fi experience and if you are sensitive enough you will grasp it. I feel that people should open their minds a little bit more. just like the Wachowskis changed the industry with the matrix while making us question everything, they are also screening a ""hollywood like"" film that has much more to offer than what meets the eye. it shows how some of our own actions and everyday life choices are far out of the moral compass.

608,abogadosolis,"amazing visuals, empty story, bad casting: disappointing",4,8 February 2015,"I really wanted to I like this movie. I love sci-fi movies.The good: the production design, special effects.The bad: everything else. The story (if you can call it that) is minimal, boring, predictable and basically comes down to a fight for real estate. Then the performances are very, very weak. C. Tatum is an interesting action hero. M. Kunis misses the mark with his character, is a charmless young girl and after the huge revelation of intelligent life on other planets and how that involves her, she reacts with the same emotion of someone who just found $ 5 in her pocket . And the worst: E. Redmayne is the most ridiculous and mannered villain I've seen in a long time.In addition, there are a series of bizarre names and institutions and characters that appear and disappear without sense, so you never can feel related to what's going on in the screen.In many ways it reminded me DUNE, but without the depth or other readings of that movie.Fortunately I bought tickets with promotional price, otherwise I would have hurt more to lose my money. May the Wachowski brothers find their way back to the land of good stories that go along with these beautiful images that know how to create.4 out of ten stars.",Jupiter Ascending
609,cezone_99,Great movie,10,17 January 2019,Great movie and I've watched it multiple times already!!! First of all it has a Matrix feeling to it because of the Wachowski siblings. After rewatching it several times I actually felt bad for the Abraxes siblings. Basically they lived for centuries through the rejuvenation gel of the planet farms. The human goop. Over 19 millenniums and the Mom (Mila Kunis) had enough and had her son kill her. He was devastated by this and actually loved her so much. But the soundtrack in the movie made all the children seem like Villians. It takes a lot of creativity to make a movie as brilliant as this.,Jupiter Ascending

613,phersh,"A creative, brilliant, imaginative 9",9,6 February 2015,"I love ""Jupiter Ascending"". I've seen it once and I'm going to go see it again.It had my heart pounding and my blood racing. On the Hershkowitz meter where 1 sucks and 10 is great, this movie is a creative, brilliant, imaginative and original nine.Others have commented on the stunning visual design of this movie. I urge you to go see it on the big screen. This is what the Wachowski siblings do best. The colors and imagery are unbelievably wonderful. The special effects are well rendered and definitely not cheesy. The sight of Channing Tatum skateboarding through air is fantastic. There's a great spaceship fight over the city of Chicago that had my heart racing, and ended with a giggle. Go see for yourself!The music is by Michael Giacchino. If you don't recognize that name, you should. He composed the soundtrack for Star Trek, Ratatouille and Up!, among others. He's a great composer. Lots of orchestra and chorus accompany this fantastic space opera movie.And space opera it is indeed. The Wachowski siblings are nothing if not visual and they pay stylistic homage to all of the best works in the space opera genre including but not limited to: The Foundation by Asimov (The great central planet Trantor. Or was it Vogon)Dune by Herbert (The great house of Abrasax! Really ☺) GravityAlfonso Cuarón (Floating around in space)-The Lost fleet series by Jack Campbell (Portals and Hyperspace)Startide Rising by David Brin (We are not alone)Etc., etc.Boy is this movie exciting. It got my heart racing and my blood pounding. It also had funny moments and touching moments. I thought the scenes with Mila Kunis and her family were very effective and moving. The actors did a very credible job holding space on screen in the middle of this full on full-blown space opera action movie. And Sean Bean doesn't die☺Lots of Channing Tatum with his shirt off and Mila Kunis in skimpy outfits aren't hard to watch.The Wachowski siblings wrote the screenplay and it has gotten a lot of criticism. I think people don't understand it. In my mind, it's not much different from a Star Wars movie. It's a fairytale and an adventure story and it works. I love 3-D and I think it is used very well here. I love it when that fourth wall fades away and I'm flying through outer space. That's a very personal and subjective opinion. I know other people hate 3D. The movie has been released in both 2D and 3D. I'll probably see in in 2D when I see it again this weekend.The fight scenes probably go on for a bit longer than I like but I can say the same about most of the movies made today including mega-hits like Ironman and The Avengers.Jupiter Ascending is a heart stopping popcorn munching spectacular 9.Go see it!",Jupiter Ascending
614,nbarrett@noos.fr,In defence of rip-roaring space opera!,8,9 May 2015,"All I need really say is ""Wow!""But that's not quite true. If two bright movie directors were to put chunks of ""Star Wars"", ""Brazil,"" ""Soylent Green,"" ""Dune"" and even a few ""Star Trek"" episodes into a blender and shake thoroughly, the resulting cocktail might be a basis for ""Jupiter Ascending"", fast-moving, rich in ideas and frequently explosive.But I'm not accusing the Wachowskis of plagiarism, far from it. To my mind, Andy and Lana have paid affectionate tribute to several sci-fi classics to serve up a rollicking roller-coaster of high-octane space opera with multiple plots. The ride was the most fun I've had since tearing through Peter Hamilton's ""Night's Dawn"" trilogy, which could make a fabulous film but might daunt even these adventurous brothers at more than 3,000 pages I could swear I saw the space station from ""2001"" at one point in the visual blockbuster, which would suggest that the filmmakers know, like those of ""Europa Report"", that the worst things in space happen in total silence, but ""Jupiter Ascending"" is decidedly not that kind of movie.When the film was first released, eye-catching posters in the Métro attracted and confounded me. The backdrop locations and the costumes looked too crazy and gaudy for a film even from the makers of ""The Matrix"" saga, let alone ""Bound"" long ago. So I turned to paid pundits for advice and foolishly paid too much heed to sometimes savage reviews instead of trusting to instinct. I thus missed the movie on the big screen, for which it cries out each time we're whisked from one busy, incredible venue to the next across the galaxy. I do disagree with reviewers who said that staggering special effects detracted from tales of family feuding and nasty prospects for the people of Earth and other owned planets. Did some people also fail to realise that ""Jupiter Ascending"" is often pretty funny -- intentionally?The Wachowskis simply let their hair down on a big budget and this pays off. Terry Gilliam didn't take an appropriate cameo part for nothing, while Eddie Redmayne shone in what must be his first villainous role, a far cry from the starry-eyed youth of ""My Week with Marianne"". I shan't say that the leads, Mila Kunis and Channing Tatum, were at their finest compared with previous parts, but both did pretty darned well and put in confident performances, given that much of the time they presumably had to shoot scenes with little idea of the settings they would be standing in or flying around in the final picture. Heck, they even donned spacesuits out of nowhere in thin air, I mean vacuum! And they developed real chemistry, which always helps.If a chance to watch ""Jupiter Arising"" in a big cinema comes up again, as sometimes it does, I'll take it, but can dispense with the 3D effects, too often hit and miss anyway. And far from agreeing with people who feel the Wachowskis messed up the chance for a franchise, I'm satisfied with a movie where they rolled out a complex story in a couple of hours. Next time, I look forward to something completely different again.",Jupiter Ascending
615,bcooke,Great fun,7,6 January 2016,"I watched this on TV after seeing the IMDb rating. Despite seeing the IMDb rating. My expectations were low and they were greatly exceeded. Visually gorgeous, silly science fiction that I can't help bracketing with the Fifth Element. Of course it isn't deep, but it is very entertaining, has a great cast and lots of action.Couldn't help but compare Eddie Redmayne to Gary Oldman, and Channing Tatum to Brad Pitt. Mila was plenty good enough.I think it's a great shame that this movie has such a low rating and I give it a seven. It kept me thoroughly entertained throughout. I'm trying to think of other fun, silly, original SF movies that come into the same category. Flash Gordon and Dune come to mind.",Jupiter Ascending

It's that kind of movie you want to replay or want a sequel.I hope that soon they will make a sequel.As usual, Mila Kunis is a delight and the rest of cast, like Eddie Redmayne, Sean Bean, Channing Tatum are playing very good.So, I highly recommend this movie !!",Jupiter Ascending

Being a big Wachowskis fan I felt embarrassed to watch this film till the end. But I did. The special effects were spectacular and that was about it. The characters were caricatures, there was no depth to them and their lines were so boring they made me roll my eyes. So, Jupiter (Mila Kunis) gets kidnapped, almost killed, promoted to Queen, discovers that the earth is being used to ""cultivate"" humans for consumption and her acting is ""oh, just another day"". She just gets to move around a lot. There was no soul to the main character, no spark. The only thing that made me think that the film had potential was when Sean Bean first appeared and started explaining to Kunis how we humans came from Orion, inhabited the earth hundreds of thousands of years ago and mated with other species (Neanderthals apparently). At that point I thought the film was going to be about the origins of humankind but, nope, it was about a couple of brats trying to get cleaner-queen of the earth Kunis to hand over the planet to them. That was a very high budget film and the actors were good which makes it even more of a shame for its wasted potential.",Jupiter Ascending
618,yarbros,What The F?,3,11 February 2015,"I sat through most of this dog and finally walked out after the nonsense overwhelmed me. The beginning of the movie makes no sense and offers nothing to the story. That would eliminate about 15 minutes. Then Jupiter shows up in Chicago as a toilet bowl cleaner while living with her mother and other Russian exiles. I don't know about you but I'll bet there aren't too many toilet bowl cleaners in the US that look like Mila. From there the chaos starts. A war above the city begins about what we know not with massive damage to the surroundings. Talk about editing! The editor must have been on vacation because the actions drones on and on for no apparent reason. One minute O'Neal can hit anything he aims at and the next he can't his his ass with either hand. The shooting and crashing goes on and on to no resolution. Then the scenes from ""John Carter"" begin. Not once during the movie does Kunis evoke any sympathy or warmth and O'Neal is just as wooden as he always is. The British actors speak as if they will upset the person sitting next to them at a funeral and if the viewer is eating popcorn cannot hear them. Once the movie moves to the other world it becomes totally incomprehensible. Huge spaces devoted to nothing and strange creatures that have no identity or personality overload the screen. The plot cannot be spoiled because I do not believe there was one. I do not know the ending but can only imagine it was written for the 10 to 12 year old who attended. Wait for this turd to come out as a comic book and save a bundle!",Jupiter Ascending
619,marionette_masterhk,cliché mash-up,3,18 February 2015,"This movie lack adhesiveness. The plot is mainly responsible for that, as well as the way to express the story was weak.Pros 1) in for a treat if you are into costumes design 2) in for a treat if you like scenic design 3) they are lucky enough to have cast some popular actors and actresses. Cons 1)lack of common sense in MANY scenes i.e. 2-5 mins in the movie. Husband and a heavily pregnant wife being robbed, wouldn't anyone just give the robbers everything to protect the pregnant woman? In this movie, no, the husband chose to fight over a telescope led to the robber fired his gun.2) Heavy resemblance of signature scenes that appeared in other movies. I.e. Dropping down the ventilation shaft and looking at each other on the rail crossing, just like Darth Vader looking at Luke's scene. Doona Bae's appearance and her costumes heavily reminds audience's her appearance in Cloud atlas. Refinery scene is way to similar to the refinery scene from Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith. Memory Neurolisation from Men in Black. Douglas Booth's role on Titus Abrasax has resemblance of pale Twilight Vampire characters. Gravity boots and auto assemble breathing suit or mask is a reminder of the guardians of the galaxy. The scenes going through administrations resembled Harry Porter. Flight deck control sounded just like the crew from star trek. Cool idea that human breeding human on another planet for harvest, like machine breeding human in test tube and harvest their electric pulse in Matrix.etc etc.3) Long and boring fight scenes. Eager to impress audiences with action sequences, which the outcome of each fight scene is 100% predictable. Messy is another word to describe the quality of some of the fight scenes.4) High tech aircraft fight scenes. You can not even distinguish which is the good guy and which is the bad guy.5) Out of the blue romance scenes. Channing Tatum wasn't even putting on his charm and Mila Kunis had to throw herself on him.6) Lines are very corny. Expected cliché development throughout.7) Extremely weak storyline, except the intergalactic trade of human lives is controversial to think about.",Jupiter Ascending
620,semul,Not thought provoking movie.,5,14 December 2015,"When I see the this movie's posters at the wall , I liked it without seeing the director's name. Poster was promising a good movie as it were. Just as I saw who the directors are , I started to wait another unforgettable movie. But after watching it I must admit that it was too average,so many cliché , predictable scenes and plenty of CGI . The directors had brought an innovative serial called MATRİX 16 years ago and changed public's points of view whereas. But this movie may be come up with a new idea but it is not as original as Matrix and Bound . I am sure , it has some references to the myths , science fiction or fantastic stories etc. as it is done before for Matrix. But this time I didn't try to learn them cause I wasn't pushed to do that. In my opinion ,the most enjoyable part of the movie is bureaucratic muddle and bribery scenes that taking place in outer space. It was really amusing. So we are waiting from these creative directors thought-provoking movies in future.",Jupiter Ascending
621,susanaferenc,Awesome effects. Crap goofy story. Too much violence and negativity.,2,19 February 2015,"I went to this movie with great expectations. I thought it would be an interesting story about the universe, about people living on other planets, about super-natural powers, about space travel and so on.But I ended up with some sort of 70% fighting and bombs exploding, and evil characters in thirst of power, and aliens presented as very evil entities that want to hurt the Earth. There was so much tension and negativity in this movie that after 1 day, i still have stomach aches.The story was very cheap. Again, the aliens were presented as very evil characters. Some looked like people (some actors needed to be shown - what the hell), some looked like dinosaurs, some looked like hell knows what. They were 'a very advanced' civilization. Bullshit. Advanced only technologically. But as level of consciousness they were bellow Earth. They had very egoistic behavior, they wanted power, and possessions, and unlimited life. They were much into killing and torturing, and lying and playing scams. BUT HEY, THAT'S NOT EVEN POSSIBLE. We all know that Atlantis was self-destroyed because they were very advanced technologically, but as level of consciousness they were falling. The Universe cannot sustain such a species. Again, a lot of goofs. Some characters had the power of teleportation, but when they fought, they didn't anymore. Caine only could fly because of some roller-skates. HAHA! And many more.I was expecting a more creative, inspiring and realistic plot. This will only work for people who want to see special effects and people fighting and bombs exploding. And boy saves girl in the last second. But people that have a little bit more knowledge about how the Universe works, and read a bit about aliens and civilizations, will just find this movie absurd and a wanna-be-cheap-blockbuster.The visual effects were indeed great.

She finds out she's the reincarnation of a superhuman who owns the earth. Movie ends with her cleaning toilets, again. THE END. Your welcome. It's a waste of time.

Since Larry's change into Lana, his work has seriously taken a turn for the serious, but, irrelevant. The opening sequence seems innocently enough as a romance between a mother of the daughter, who is getting impregnated. If it weren't for the hand (yes, the tell-tale right hand), suddenly, what was once a normal woman becomes a shocking... I will not say it. Then, as a segue way to the romancing of the pregnant mother, a line, ""It is more to not look on what is on the outside of the person but for the greater good inside the person."" Morals? Since when did people drop moral values as one liners in movies?Later on, a picture of this mother appears on the daughter's cell-phone. She has some gnarly, freakish smile that just makes me guffaw in disgust. Is this some kind of sick joke played on the audience? We know that a Mila Kunis could not come from her but are we lead to believe?So it's an action movie, no wait, it's a Cinderella movie. There's a huge ring that the bridge to be is to wear in exchange for saving the human race via sacrifice. Or, there's the other route, which is the cool explosive route, reminiscent of Matrix choreography. Yes, it's as if the sub-plot was far too unpacked and it doesn't complement the main plot. What exactly is the main plot though? Or are we just glorifying the idea of marriage too, now?Well, what is redeeming of this movie? I have to say, the art direction, the CGI (like when the ship is going through the clouds of Jupiter), the sets are all really cool. I'd say all of the actors did a really good job (except for that one I mentioned). The action is great but the sky-skating reminds me strongly of ice skating. And the glittery, whooshing, trails they make through out the sky is so Disney. More of that feminine bull crap being mixed in a masculine movie. Honestly, I think if the Wachowskis want to save their career, they need to split ways.

Too much muscle and a buzz cut don't say 14year old obsession like a skinny with hair blocking half his eyesight. And Mila is sexy enough but not really an action heroine, especially when her looks are so down played as here. Also, the love story and Cinderella parallels are much to prominent for hard core sci-fi fans, so it also falls short with that crowd. I should have given it zero stars, but two go to Mila's eyes, one for Tatum and one for each minute Terry Gilliam is on, so five in total.",Jupiter Ascending
626,meetingivory,Sci/fi Fairytale,9,10 June 2018,"I seem to be one of the very few people who loved this movie. The eternal oddball, that's me. 
I didn't like Mila Kunis much, to be honest. I never do. She's one of those actresses who wear the same face from the beginning to the end of amovie (in every movie), but I loved everything else. Visually, it must be one of the most beautiful movies I have ever seen. The costumes, the spaceships, the action scenes, the quirky little details, the photography... everything is magnificent.
Amazing: a love story in a sci-fi movie!
Amazing: eye candy for female viewers in a sci-fi movie! 
Amazing: Sean Bean makes it all the way to the end of the movie without being gruesomely slaughtered!
I am not in any way enthusiastic about royals and royalty and all that crap, but here it works the same way it works in traditional fairytales. The whole plot of the movie is very much a traditional fairytale, Cinderella becomes a princess, the three adversaries, etc... It may not work for some, but it does or me. 
Lots of secondary characters that stand out as truly interesting and memorable, unlike so many movies where one or two great characters float in a void of appalling acting.
I didn't know Eddie Redmayne before this movie and I know many ridiculed his performance here, but it made a perfectly convincing creepy villain for me.
It is a movie that has its own strange purity, and courage too, using traditional narrative shapes that don't belong to the genre, weaving them together with elements of fantasy and comedy and romance... I suppose it could not work in this cynical time. I am sorry that it did so badly because I would have loved to spend more time in this universe, in a sequel (or two).

It's going to have a strong fan base like The Matrix. #TheWachowskis, In my opinion opened a new chapter in science fiction. The character development was kinda fast in comparison to the development of the plot, but it works out in grand fashion! In all actuality, this movie deserves a second chance by most critics at large, because I seen the film got less than rave reviews and you should just walk into the theater and see it without any bias or any intention of critiquing it.

We're in our Galaxy, and Jupiter Jones is a clumsy, naive hopelessly romantic with no validation from her Father because he's been brutally murdered, 30 something year old genetic heir to universal royalty! That was the beauty of her character. She's mistaken for someone who is typically a push over and triumphs kicking asses! All ideas are on the table with this film from parallel space travel with ships creating their own worm holes for space jump to Greys as hunters and crop circles and reptilians! You can't clown, it's not like this film was adapted from another comic book and a raccoon, a tree and a kidnapped boy turned space vagabond are all to believable.

This in contrast is a cross between a comic and a stitched together collection of passive video game cut-scenes. It is also dumbed down to the point of being sort of aimed at kids. I say sort of, as there is just enough violence so it doesn't quite rate as a kids movie. The film reeks of $176m being spent on actors and effects, and if anything was left, it was allocated to everything else including the writing.I cannot believe that people want this clichéd dribble, if they care so little about a movie, why don't they at least run an online quiz and get people to vote on the storyline.

'Budget' is everywhere (cookie-cutter everything - the first-take stiff acting and the struggling music were particularly squirm-inducing, and even downright embarrassing at times). Story Overview: What happens when airhead teens rule the universe (though the plot backdrop was interesting). Plot Details: You won't be able to follow them, so just enjoy the modern B-movie aura of each scene (which were ridiculous to me - though that is just me - my wife was near-rave about the movie (and I wisely I did not say anything, hence my venting here).

636,uranassbandit,Under-developed with terrible leads,5,3 April 2015,"I rarely write reviews, preferring to laugh at the shills instead (sadly 80-90% of reviews on new films these days). That this film irritated me enough to post says it all. *It tested extremely badly with screener audiences (who usually are much kinder than the general public) *Its trailer was routinely laughed at by cinema audiences (tell me you didn't laugh at the trailer?)*It created very little buzz or expectation from the public, so it was going to bomb badlyso understandably;*It was shelved for more than 9 months whilst the studio looked to write down their losses and shop for a third-world VFX company to finish it *It went over-budget significantly, meaning even less chance of financial success *It overshot its advertising budget massively in a bad attempt at damage control*It was turfed from summer blockbuster to a February slot where films come to dieThe film makers tried to pass off this set of occurrences to VFX not being finished, because the truth was much harder to swallow. They had made a stinker. An entertaining stinker, but a smelly old stinker all the same. All this tells you, the audience member, not to expect much going in and I was no different. I didn't think this was going to be a good ""film"", expecting it to suck hard and I was rewarded beyond my expectations. Disastrous casting choices had given us 2 bad leads, a situation they could have avoided easily, but both them and us were now stuck with this lot. Mila Kunis is not ""blockbuster"" material (she was terrible in Oz the Great and Powerful) and Channing Tatum is one of the worst leading men in Hollywood history. That, as a whole, they could not drum up any chemistry together just made this film even harder to appreciate. 2 bad leads who people don't respond to, acting poorly with bad dialogue and even poorer chemistry. Well why should I even bother breaking down the film further, this has flop written all over it by now.In quick summation, with all the extra time bought by shelving the film they obviously shot or reshot loads more confusing action sequences to ""entertain"" us all more. End result, they probably made it worse. I lost interest during the action and starting web-browsing and I don't have ADD. Man-liner wearing Tatum flying around shirtless, wearing space age roller skates easily defeating pointless antagonists..and about 40 minutes of it. Redmayne was overacting badly too and clearly out of his depth as the ""super villain"".You should still watch it sometime because it is entertaining, just don't expect to want to watch it again any time soon. 4.9 out of 10 because it just doesn't deserve a pass grade.As an addendum, I should point out that Hollywood is starting to look further abroad for their marketing strategies these days. The Chinese market is booming as a consumer base and I genuinely believe that the average American movie goer is getting smarter and more discriminating in their taste and expectations. This film has all the hallmarks of a story shot for the less discriminating Chinese audience. Even Japanese and Korean audiences would appreciate the mandate. A paper-thin story, bad dialogue, bad characters, poor acting, overly-wrought action sequences and a lack of direction. Exactly what I would expect if this had been the latest Mandarin or Cantonese blockbuster.",Jupiter Ascending
637,AshleyRyder1993,"Decent film, Minus the damsel in distress...",8,18 August 2015,"Personally I like this film, it's a decent set up for sequels, minus the damsel in distress main character and the seemingly lack of a plot... 'Woman in dead end job is a reincarnation of ancient alien royalty, because of this she becomes a target for alien hit-men - hired by the son of the person she is a reincarnation of. She gets rescued by a hunter hired by the brother of the employer alien hit men. She ends up getting captured and taken to meet the sister of the two brothers who have hired people to find her. Gets captured again and meets one of the brothers. Gets rescued again. Gets captured again (voluntarily). Gets rescued again'Plot is pretty much to meet the family members of the person she is the reincarnation of and set up the start of (Assumingly) another trilogy. The main character needs to control her urges, every moment she's alone with the other main protagonist she's flirting with him in one way or another.Bees sense royalty..? So this human is naturally born with royal genes... That doesn't make sense really. Royalty is defined by who has the most power and people willing to call you by some form of title.Cleaning toilets for a living, yep, I would hate my life too. But C'est la vie, almost everyone hates their job, but at least it pays the bills.Sharing a house with how many, three? generations of relatives and/or work colleagues... Didn't know that people did that in this day and ageBut to end this review on a positive note. I do like this film, some of the characters are rather interesting and they have some good character development. Others I love regardless of their flaws simply because there was actually some good acting by the actors in the film. I would love there to be sequels to this film, they have an intriguing mash up on sci-fi movie elements wrapped into one. And there is some good potential setting up for future films. I also think that since two characters (At least) who are supposed to be dead, are actually not dead since they didn't die on screen.Balem and TskalikinMy Logic: Life isn't shown leaving the character or the dead body isn't seen = character is not dead.My suspicions on this would be that Tskalikin would become an ally to the protagonist(I hope), and Balem will be back and causing universal havoc with a great big army.So yes, I am interested in seeing if my suspicions are correct, and if so how it would all turn out in general, so, Andy and Lana, please make sequels. Despite everything, I really love this film. It's got some pretty amazing visual effects, a rather in depth world back-story, and potentially an empire crashing protagonist.",Jupiter Ascending

Clearly, a really expensive Hollywood tent-pole but it just lacked any luster. I like all the actors, I love the filmmakers, I'm a SciFi nut and am willing to accept some incredible jumps in feasibility to say nothing of the laws of physics if a film is entertaining, but, darn, it just didn't happen in this one. I'm not sure if the film lacked inspiration, got away from the filmmakers, was movie-by-committied out of getting there but it was simply the least interesting SciFi film I think I have ever seen. It feels as if all of the ingredients for successful films were all fed into a computer, randomize and a script was written based on those criteria.

The Aegis cruiser cannot make it though the barrier around Jupiter, but the a fore mentioned and apparently lacking, single manned craft can.There are humanoid royalty, empowered by their birthright, for 14 millennia, but they have no children, and two Earthlings give birth to their mother reincarnated. The three royal children are trying to kill the reincarnated mother, but following the movie environment, she would reincarnate again.They have super advance technology but in some scenes the equipment requires a hand crank technology circa 1800s.The only plus was the visual effects, but the chase scenes were too far fetched and long.Mila role was cleaning toilets and being rescued, period. Due to laws, Mila's character supposedly saves Earth by refusing to sign over the deed to Earth, which will result in her death and the death of her family. However the royal family has ignored the law the entire movie. So the whole premise of the movie is flawed.Save your money, and don't even bother renting this.",Jupiter Ascending

Still, for an ""original"" film, it is not very... original. Which, however, is not necessarily a bad thing.""Jupiter Ascending"" is a classic space adventure, and offers everything you could expect from such a movie. I would not compare it to epics like ""Star Wars"" and ""Star Trek"", or even ""The Matrix"", despite some common themes, but rather to ""Flash Gordon"" and ""John Carter"".Prior to seeing the movie, I was a bit concerned with the cast. Channing Tatum might not have been my first choice, but he is pretty decent as Caine Wise, and Mila Kunis is decently pretty as Jupiter Jones. Sean Bean is a nice addition, as always, and Eddie Redmayne is a good bad guy, and his acting was a lot better than people say.Visually, the film is beautiful. There are certain Transformers-like action sequences with a lot of close-ups of CGI metal flying around, when it is difficult to understand what is going on, but other than that I really liked the effects and the cinematography. The musical score is nothing outstanding, but it is still good and fitting for the movie.Overall, ""Jupiter Ascending"" is a solid space adventure film, and I would recommend to the fans of the genre to see it in cinemas, both to make the most of the viewing experience and to support original films.",Jupiter Ascending
645,andrew052-109-192018,"extremely bad movie; Wachowski brothers, why??? Matrix 1's my Number 1 movie (watched it like 10 times)",1,7 February 2015,"""They bees' swarming was so inarticulate. I guess that graphics designer was chosen by the tender -- he bid the lowest price"" (there's a writing in the Moscow underground -- ""way-out"" -- it was translated through the tender process (they seem to not know the difference between ""exit"" and ""way-out"").This is an extremely bad movie. The storyline is immensely interesting (in terms of the matrix-style humans as resources line). The execution of the storyline is really bad. The villains -- the better brother and the sister -- are really bad characters. All of the gorgeous graphics, all of the 3D effects -- all of this looks like something you would say about the used car -- bunch of embellishments. I dunno, but this is kinda a watershed for me. I was 13, when I saw Matrix. I watched it with my family in -- all of us (except for my mom, who did not care for it). It was a mind-changer. Now, I am 28 and after 15 years I still can go back and watch Matrix just for fun and never-ever will I say -- oh, it's just effects on effects. That bullet, that coat, that red woman, that porridge. But this movie lacks all of that -- it seems like avengers, pacific rim -- the movies that 13-year-old care about, not the grown-ups. Consequently, there are two options -- either I am growing up or there's no way that a) you can jump higher that your head (meaning that you momentarily compare the first 5 mins of the movie versus matrix 1 and see that it's gonna be bad right till the end), b) the movie industry's going the wrong way, catering to the 13-year- old. I guess that this movie will be one of those movies that you forget at once. Also, it's cheating -- you can't just take the matrix idea, repack it and do a new movie on that. Also, I really liked how old-time furniture and buildings are married with alien tech. Taking into account that pyramids were no way built by us, I am still in favor of the alien involvement and any new takes on that are great -- vampire line is a new take on that -- so it's good for to see it, to get indoctrinated step by step in order for us to get ready for the contact.Also, I truly believe that we are being constantly watched -- right from the beginning of the humanrace. Naturally, you can just have cows and harvest them, but cows won't be able to multiply the way humans do. The humankind's numbers started to grow after the industrial revolution, but da vince was allegedly given by the aliens heaps of tech. Looks like there's a schedule and according to it it was just too early for us to grow in numbers, not because we weren't ready, but just because there was a schedule -- like, you need to go for XXX years, then you can grow in numbers. So, I am totally on board with the harvest idea. Almost everybody believes in aliens -- if you are a religious person, you believe in a alien being, called J.C.God. If you are an atheist, you believe that there's no God, but every atheist's sure to agree that you will be able to travel to other planets in the future. If you travel there and then come back after 2000 years, then you've got the aliens. I don't believe in such a great diversity of alien species, but genetic engineering seems really plausible, since you do have our GNA, which was surely modified. So, I am on board with this idea too. All in all, this shows what failure is. Now it's time to see how the industry reacts to it, coz, I am telling you, I cannot go to the movie year after year to see Pacific Rims. It's just nonsense. And I can't watch nonsense. I have finished Anna Karenina. I can easily see, when a garbage movies tries to pass a matrix stuff.4 specific notes:1) one small ship was able to destroy that dude's mega-ship on Jupiter? So, like for several thousand years, he was able to survive? Then he could not anymore? Why wouldn't he just dispatch those small block things and sew up the hole? 2) Why is the main character reacting so well to what's going on? Neo was freaking out about the porridge. She's like -- a doll -- you turn down, her eyes are closed, up - eyes opened. What was going on on the shooting set? How could the director not see, how stupid she is and how unnatural the whole fabric of the movie is. 3) What's with the pad??? You got a piece of tissue to cover your wound? Why would the dude who had - for God's sake -- wings care about whether there was a pad used or -- I dunno -- heap of grass used to cover the wound? He would not. Nobody would care about the pad being used. I would use the pad and just throw it in the garbage bin. THE WINGED BEING DO NOT CARE ABOUT PAD!!!4) Being should be going in swarms like fish, in colums, in zig-zags in such movies, but there were just swirling around her? Were these real bees??? Like Wachowski despairingly to the bees trade union's: ""Dudue, you need swarm better -- Remember like in that Matrix those robots get in columns -- do that, OK"", the bees' guy ""Zzzzory, it's hard for uzzzz. We are bezzz, we aren't actorzzz. I'll talk to the guyzzz"". I CAN DO BETTER SWARMING ON MY PC!!!",Jupiter Ascending

647,marrich2009,Unfairly criticised is an understatement,9,12 February 2015,"OK, the main thread is simple blockbuster fare, but this has so much allusion thrown in it to make this a sci-fi classic and it is in exactly the vein of the previous Wachowski movies. It has obvious elements of the Matrix, Cloud Atlas, and V for Vendetta thrown in, yet so many have said otherwise. Did they really digest this movie? On top of that, you can throw in a pinch of Dune, Battlefield Earth, The Last Starfighter, anything by Terry Gilliam (as well as Terry Gilliam himself!) and yes, Flash Gordon, amongst probably a dozen or so other sci-fi movies. Like its predecessors, you have the usual commentary of social pyramids, corporate agendas, inhumane consumerism and the trance of ignorance to it all that we like to walk around in. There's the hint (and not subtle either) that gods and angels are simply advanced extra-terrestrials that have been spanning the universe for millennia, a touch of Robin Collyn's ""Prehistoric Germ Warfare"", explanations for our continually alleged sightings of ""Greys"", the post-modern mish-mash of Egyptian, Roman and Greek civilisations being elevated universal slave drivers, the future of gene mapping, the idea that by probability the thousands of genes in our genome may be perfectly replicated over time to effectively reincarnate a person, the future of stem cell research combined with isolating the genes for cell reproduction, and perhaps a whole lot more that could be picked out from a second viewing.I'd say that the problem is that these things aren't spelled out, but I'd be lying.

648,robroyfingerhead2,I Really Wanted to Like This Movie - But it sucked.,3,7 February 2015,"Spoilers!I really don't know how such semi-talented directors could produce such dreck. But not in a way that ""it's so bad that it's good"" but is ""it's so bad, it's just a pathetic waste""The film is almost unwatchable. The plot, pacing, set/visual design and characters are all bad. Plot - is this, Mila has the same 'genetic imprint' as the owner of Earth. Earth was seeded with humans by a corporation that intends to 'harvest' the planet to make an anti-aging bath (because we have nice skin - I kid you not]). Earth's original owner has two sons that fight over who gets to keep Earth while taking it away from the new owner (Mila). Thus the plot is 1) Mila looks confused and seems to trust one of the brothers 2) _almost_ gives up her rights to the Earth before she realizes she doesn't have a choice and is being forced to when 3) the skate-wolf comes to her rescue. We loop through this exact sequence THREE times in the movie. Pacing - since we need to go through the three capture/threaten/escape sequences, all with their own CGI battle, while also trying to navigate sub-plots and ""breathtaking visuals"" the weight of the plot/visuals just implode making the movie blend together into a mess. Even worse, they include mini-homages/vignettes that just make the movie look amateurish and totally break any tension/flow. For example, when they need to prove that Mila owns earth, they have to go through a ""RMV of aliens"" that is pretty much RMV but with aliens. It's an in-joke with the audacity to present itself as clever when it just seems amateurish. Design - derivative and boring. Costumes reminded me of the awful '80s Flash Gordon movie and the ""fish like"" spaceship-design has been done much better. We also get the Pacific Rim ""we can't really make the effects we want look real during the day so let's make them happen at night, in the rain"" cop out. Other than that, I was reminded of The Fifth Element in some of their set-design and have seen other places done better.Characters - Mila doesn't seem to have anything to work with regarding character development in the storyline. She just seems to spend much of the movie playing a not-so-bright victim. Hardly a feminine hero but more of a heroine that needs to be rescued by a man-wolf. Said man-wolf is Tatem, who also seems to have a very limited emotional range. We never really feel that there is an internal struggle between getting paid to deliver Mila to one of the brothers and bringing her to claim her heritage. And their romantic chemistry is non-existent either because she's looking at his vulcan-ears or he's thinks she looks like she just drank a bottle of cough-syrup. We are also treated to the ""no-one-dies"" revenue enhancer, the ""guardians of the galaxy"" space-shield, the ""star-trek"" fly-next-to-me-through-the-obstacles action sequence, the ""Soylent Green"" 'the money is people' reveal, the conflicted mentor who betrays the wolf-guy only to later save him, and many shots of Mila falling in slow motion.Ugh.",Jupiter Ascending

Uncomfortable dialog. Predictable and cringe-worthy, one can only describe it as the Nickelback of film.

653,slavkoss,My vote could be 8 or 9 but because Everyone Is Wrong About this movie I gave it 10 of 10.,10,20 February 2016,"This movie won Village Voice Film Poll 2015 award: ""Movie Everyone Is Wrong About"". Why 8 or 9 ? compared with all that boring pseudo art movies with 7 or more Jupiter deserves 15. IMDb stuff vote it 6.6, girls under 18 vote it 6.3. I think all others are wrong (5.4 is shame and shows that they need explanation). It's theme is Cinderella exploitation (stilling life quality) and Nonhuman/evil/crazy/primitive barons theme - public exploitation (stilling lives). Here is one of negative reviews which nobody should write so as it is written (without explanation) - MY COMMENTS ABOUT IT:386 out of 613 people found the following review useful: Everything that is wrong with cinema today is seen in this movie 1/10 Author: D- BorG from Serbia and Montenegro 7 March 20151. The movie feels like it was written by a ten year old girl hooked on drugs. - NOT TRUE - story is excellent - Cinderella which is queen is much better than Cinderella which will be kings wife. If movie is difficult to follow - repeat watching movie - it is made as best fairy tale (Cinderella) movies or as Avatar 2009 (Pocahontas, imperialism). Jupiter ascending is much more than Cinderella story:Eternal life based on stealing our brothers/sisters lives - same crime as world war I, II and thousands little wars leaded by nonhuman evil/crazy barons (like our Balkan wars with all their nationalist lays). Movie is new view on genetic future which is malformed because of our negligence (bezobzirnost). X-men movies show other view on genetic future. How will Earth queen and her daughter handle in movie sequel ? How be stronger then theft gangs ?Nonhuman/evil/crazy/primitive barons is one of the most important movie theme which should be repeated again and again until people see them (their lays) as really they are. Expert thieves are expert liars. Both Jupiter sons tried to kill her to stole her kingdom - illustration of mans necrophilia love for to have, to be more rich. Jupiter daughter does not wish to be more rich by killing mother, she helped her - illustration of womens life love. History shows many such examples and good movies should show them again and again.May be negative review writers are not aware that they write like payed propaganda of bureaucrats and Nonhuman/evil/crazy/primitive barons. If they do not like Cinderella-is-queen-in-malformed-world- like-ours-world or Pocahontas-against-imperialism stories or something else (cleaning toilets), they should not say that whole movie is garbage. It would be very informative if negative review writers say what they like - I am sure not same as I like - we can than say why we like/dislike something and at end it will be clear that some people think that queen that cleans toilets is excellent idea and some that it spoils them whole movie - appearance (estetic) is very important to us. Remember Mohamed caricatures and some Muslims reactions ?2. Cardboard characters are so undeveloped ... - Which (SF) movie has better developed characters ? 5 minutes about bureaucrat said all what should, like whole Brasil movie (which is a bit boring and my vote for it is 6, same as for Clarks Odysees). Family life is also here - they clean toilets, sell eggs to reach a bit of human decency (like we all do, but many of us are not aware of this) but they love each other. - This is great life love message. The question is why we clean toilets and sell our eggs to reach a bit decency and we must again and again be reminded on this question.3. Bad acting and ""I don't care about what is going on"" attitude from the actors brings final nail to this movie coffin. - acting is OK for SF/fairy tale movie where is idea/theme important.4. There is nothing substantial in this movie, nothing that can teach us something new about ourselves or the world around us - NOT TRUE as I showed under paragraph 1, 2.5. True the cinematography of the movie is first class... Bright lights and a false promise, but it will leave you with a mouth full of ash, wondering why you wasted your time - NOT TRUE as I showed under paragraph 1,2. Movie leaves us with better understanding of human crimes and hope that there could be two queens which could save us from mans necrophilia. I am man but I think it should be some low to allow only queens - and no necrophilia king-Kong-beasts like Miloević, Tuđman... Tito was not necrophilia king, he was not impotent macho, but he loved women and life. Yes Tito killed many nationalists, but looking how nationalists sold in world war II parts of our country and now all of us... only possible alternative is to make all believers to understand such movies which explain what is most important: stealing our lives. That's why Jupiter is great movie, yes to much circus, but we all like circus (maximus). Movie could cost 50 million $, not 150 - 150 it is authors mistake.And one technical detail: there was no country named Serbia and Montenegro 7 March 2015, there were only banana republics Serbia, Montenegro, Croatia... which gave us Balkan nationalists. I agree with that greater country is better than small, Austro-Hungarian was better than Yugoslavia ? or whatever only not to small - but Balkan nationalists did us what they did and we must love what we have - not lie like you lie in your review (in theft interest aware you of it or not).This is not political text but text about stealing like movie is.

Yes; I love movies with no obvious end and this is done.My criticism will be at the end of movie, because even if I enjoy deep and complex stories, it goes a bit too much on that and the plot tend to be too complex to be understable, just in the last 30eens minutes.Also, because IMDb needs more lines, I don't like the part where a character is in a stuck way - but I understand it's part of the script.

The story could have been quite good but the characters so crappy to be comical. The 3 brothers were your typical idiots with too much sense of entitlement. The older one looked like he was always on drugs or something that make it look more of a ridiculous figure than a fearsome one. Younger brother was an unctuous idiot and the sister appeared and disappeared without leaving trace apart from a view of her ass to remember her...sooo bland a character as to be almost invisible. Mila's character is of a little idiot that ca be convinced to do anything you want... appears to have the personality of a paperweight...god she was driving me crazy with the wish to slap her every other scene! Best times were when she didn't have any dialog and the camera was just focusing on those perfect smoky eyes even while cleaning toilets.... who cleans toilets in full make up fgs! And her family...? a bunch of sandwiches short of a picnic....btw that little boy needs therapy....or maybe some brain cells?

Starting with the story line it is unique and interesting storyline about harvesting humans, family battles in outer space worlds and personal problems with Jupiter. If you take the whole story line and general premise in them I can't understand why you would find it a bad film. It has fight scenes, explosions, cgi a plenty, romance, great story line and goes on!

No its not Hitchcock, as someone pointed out, but did you really think it would be? The plot is unusual, but I take that as a good thing. The villains aren't cool, you absolutely hate them, but thats the point isn't it? The production design and special effects are amazing and the score is epic. Its has also been said that there is no humour to it, but completely disagree with that too. There is a lot of exposition, but again there is also a lot of action. The Wachowski's tried something new and succeeded....even tho some of the animal spliced humans are a bit 60's star trek. Films like the Transformer series make millions and they are soulless cack. Like everything in this life, don't listen to those that have done it, try it for yourselves and take from it what you will. Much better on 2nd viewing",Jupiter Ascending

They really missed the mark with this one. Some of the lines literally made me cringe. And I'm actually a huge Mila Kunis fan but she was terrible in this movie. As was Channing Tatum. I found their characters to be played out and flat, I actually found myself really hating Mila Kunis' character by the end because she was attempting the typical good natured protagonist but it just came off as weak. This movie was a mix of really bad writing and sub par acting rolled into an extremely out there concept so it was just a clustered mess. The only saving grace for this movie were the special effects, which are actually pretty cool, and Eddie Radmayne who plays a great villain. Also, its way too long it just drags on and on.",Jupiter Ascending

I loved the characters and the actors that played them.If you are looking for an interesting story with likable characters then watch this!The bad reviews this film has received seem to be from people who enjoy a certain style of big blockbuster films that make three films then go back to before the initial films are made to make a few more.Yet another great film series that's life was cut short because it wasn't a retro remake or vampire series.Take a look as it's not terrible like most reviews would have you believe.,Jupiter Ascending
662,flavjohk,Entertaining Space Escape,7,17 August 2016,"A lot of haters out there! It is easy for reviewers to smugly sit back and criticize any movie for any reason. The major complaint is that the Jupiter Ascending (JA) lacked substance. PLEASE. Hollywood lacks substance. The purpose of all movies is to entertain, not enlighten. Roller coasters can not expand the mind when they are only made to thrill. Many reviewers said they walked into the theater expecting the worst, then why bother? Perhaps they would have been more entertained by Sponge Bob the Movie. It was an option at the time. The true sophisticates could have rented Out of Africa and gotten a belly full of character development. The legions of Star Wars fans line up to see movies with just as much depth, but you don't read reviewers bitching about George Lucas.Nancy Blatch made the statement that millennia old advanced species would behave differently. If that were the case, there would be no flipping movie. Of course any advanced culture would have little in common with Earth's messed up primates. That's why we go to the movies, to escape.Let me break it down: 1) JA is first and foremost an action movie and if pleases the kids while not boring me, I'm in. Dynamic action sequences start to finish. 2) Special effects for Science Fiction is a given. Does this movie deliver? Yes 3) JA has unique and original elements. The seeding and harvesting of planets for their human crop is new. The merging of tech and biological beings is pretty cool. 4) The visuals are excellent and world crafting worth a deeper look. 5) Characterization is not the prime mover and may strike many as being superficial. Do you want backstory or a trip to an alien home-world. I vote home-world 6) The actors are engaging and accessible regardless of how many dimensions they express. Like our society is 3 dimensional.Go for the ride. Go for the visuals. Just watch and see for yourself. As for the haters they can rock back and forth droning, ""Look mommy I spread pooh all over the TV.""",Jupiter Ascending

I highly recommend the movie to every person who likes mysterious action and weird romance.Personally, it was the most likable ending ever.

Random out of place scenes and characters shoe horned in for no clear or discernible reason. The plot? Utterly no idea. It's clear this film has delusions of grandeur early on. It fancies itself as both a high concept sci-fi and blockbuster in one. It's neither. It's simply a mess held together loosely by some talented A list Hollywood leading actors directed poorly and who like the audience are not clear on what the whole thing is about.

You get a good idea of it by about 30m as Jupe (Mila Kunis, hot) finds out. If they had described it correctly it would ruin it.It's camp as in 'Flash Gordon' at some points but this makes it unique.

666,jarjartehsith,"When Jupiter Ascends, the Wachowskis descend.",4,20 September 2017,"First off, this movie is not good. There is literally only one good thing about this movie. Some of the effects/action scenes are MEDIOCRE. Starting with the plot, Jupiter is a young woman/illegal alien from Russia who is apparently the reincarnation of a monarch that died AFTER she was born, or was it before? Oh well, not that I cared anyways. Basically after the bounty hunters were brought in from the monarchs children to find the mother's reincarnation, we meet Channing Tatum, who plays Cain Wise. A man who was an experiment by the government, and has dog-like senses, and yet, as proved at the end of the movie, it's revealed he once had wings? So they do some stuff, meet a guy, PROVE THAT BEES CAN SENSE ROYALTY EVEN IF IT IS A HUMAN REINCARNATION OF A LITERAL ALIEN, and meet two of the children. The daughter, reveals how they prolong their life, via special moisturizer, and the son reveals how this moisturizer is made, with humans, and not the dead kind. Basically the son tries to marry the reincarnation of his mother(just go along with it) and Caine and the guy we met from earlier stop the wedding because ""I love you"" and ""He's going to kill you after the wedding"". So they meet the second son, who has Jupiter's mean family and will let them go if Jupiter gives him Earth. So action scene #40 happens and creepo bro admits that HE KILLED THE MOTHER! (You get 5 extra points if A: you were genuinely surprised, or B: you still care) and he gets shot in the nuts two times. So the brother dies, Jupiter becomes queen of Earth, and I want to die. So yes, it is that bad.",Jupiter Ascending

If you are looking for the next Matrix or Alien or Riddick then this isn't for you. This is a movie ""type"" i remember from my youth, where the story makes the characters not the other way around. If you are old enough to remember Krull then you will know what i mean. Movies used to be all about the story and action, where the ""hero"" became the hero during the movie and not ""built up"" in pre-story character development (as did all other characters within the movie), basically the characters became part of the story and not the other way around.

The costumes, designs and settings are original and beautiful, and the soundtrack really makes it kind of a space opera. Although many critics single out the acting, the actors actually makes every single characters credible. For instance, Channing Tatum plays a character whose species normally needs a pack to thrives, and the distant acting performance needed to convey his situation was somewhat reproached to him, which is pretty much nonsensical. Like any Wachowski movie, action sequences are perfectly performed, totaling about 20 minutes long in eight sequences (the last one is the longest, 12 minutes long). The story line is simple and yet original and provocative, with a delightful underlying satirical component to it (although this movie isn't particularly presented as a satire, it really is one).

Found it fairly enjoyable but somewhat predictable.OK.. tl;dr version: Wicked cool visuals, mediocre story at best, decent-ish acting, Channing Tatum in lots of eyeliner, go see it (in IMAX 3D if you can.)On to the full version.The visuals were outstanding... I mean, really, really, *really* well done. The sense of scale of the massive ships / factories, the frenetic pace of the fights and battle scenes. This is a Wachowski film after all, so it's kind of expected... But still... wow... Well played, Wachowski Siblings *golf clap*... The music and the score were quite good, too. See it in IMAX 3D..... Just do it. It's worth the ticket price.The story...... Well, this is a Wachowski film after all, so the story has lofty ambitions and potential for greatness, but succumbs almost immediately to predictability and a few standard, tried & true themes and ""story elements"" and gets encumbered in the massive amounts of back story that we have to just accept as we're given it. It's basically a mediocre Sci-Fi ""B"" movie story shoehorned into a visual epic of a film. I mentioned to my friends tonight that they probably spent so much on the VFX that they had no choice but to cheap out on the story. All in all it rates a resounding ""Meh...."" (**MINOR SPOILER** Although the whole ""Anti-Gravity Surf Boots"" thing was *very* cool... actually, most of the alien tech was pretty cool.) If you go in just expecting to be entertained and not enlightened, you'll do just fine.I was impressed, though, at some of the call-outs to other films... Demolition Man's ""Associate Bob"" get a robotic homage (itself taking cues from Spielberg's ""A.I."") and there are some bureaucratic nuances lifted almost directly from Terry Gilliam's Brazil with an ever so subtle touch of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy's Vogshpere (the Vogon home world) thrown in for good measure. There's also at least one not-so-subtle nod to Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey when we arrive at the planet Orus. It's quick but unmistakable. Certain other elements of the story / settings somewhat reminded me of an updated / modernized version of 1980's Flash Gordon... and not entirely in a bad way like one would expect when making that comparison... ;) The acting was good. Mila Kunis was very believable and enjoyable in the character and... well.... Mila Kunis... ♥♥ ... Channing Tatum was not totally unenjoyable (his eyeliner budget must have rivalled that of small independent films, though) and the bad guys were all made more bad by being resoundingly British (and not fake British, either) and were played very well with only a minimal amount of scenery chewing.And **SPOILER**..SEAN BEAN DID NOT DIE.... yay!

This was just a rather dumb movie. That's all I have, sorry. The only reason I even gave it two was because I liked five of the actors in general. Sigh, but apparently I have to add more to submit....so spoiler.... Humans have lived for centuries, earth is just a stock farm and we are clueless, mila kunis is the reincarnation of one of the original overlord humans who is being hunted by one child, teased by another and the third is trying to marry her. She gets saved by magic mike who had wings, but now just has bizarre eyebrows and a spacesuit and some gravity defying rollerblades. He is helped and betrayed and then helped again by Ned Stark. And there is a bizarre scene at the intergalactic DMV.",Jupiter Ascending
689,coolbeanj,Unfairly criticized; worth a watch!,7,6 February 2015,"I saw Jupiter Ascending tonight (after a VERY long wait I might add). Sadly it is not in the vain of other Wachowski films in terms of thought- provoking subject matter; however, I feel this film is being very unfairly criticized. No: the subject matter is not as deep or profound as in The Matrix, V for Vendetta, or the masterful Cloud Atlas. But it was never advertised to be that kind of film--it's a solid blockbuster movie (with plenty of room for sequels and/or prequels). I'd see it again!If you're considering watching this film, but hesitate after reading the same scathing reviews that I came across, just consider what interests you about the movie: if you're looking a movie with a complex plot and lots of underlying messages, this might not be the best choice. It's a blockbuster film pure and simple. A good one! But a very typical blockbuster/action/romance movie.",Jupiter Ascending

It felt kinda like watching a comic book. I love comic books so, that's not a diss. I read some of the ""goofs"" and such and a lot of them can be explained away. As my late father use to tell people, ""Just watch the movie and shut up"".Now. Jupe (Jupiter). I love her. I love her more as a female action hero because she's more down to Earth...get it? Down to Earth? Anyway, most action heroines are either super strong, super smart, super fast, etc. Jupe is just human. She ain't got none of that. She makes stupid human mistakes. She's a smartass like a regular human. She defiant. She can't really fight, but she can slap around a bad guy who can't fight either. She's smart enough to duck when somebody is shooting laser beams at her. She's not taking heels when she should be taking sneakers. And most of all, she knows where to put her knee when a guy puts her in a choke hold. That's awesome. Caine. Caine is hunky. The end. He's half man, half wolf and has prosthetic wings. He can kick butt, too. What the heck do you have to think about?Her Earthly family is hilarious. Her Reoccurrence family is hilarious too, just in a ""they're all nutcases"" sort of way.I like the action. I like the storyline.

691,richt853,Jupiter Assending or just Uranus Excretion,4,21 February 2015,"After taking a day to reflect on Jupiter Ascending, the story was a good one, but there were too many arcs for a two hour film, it would have made a better book. The acting was extremely wooden, especially from the two leads, most disappointingly by Eddie Redmayne, who has proved is capable of very good acting (les miserables, theory of everything). Many dialogue heavy scenes just played out on screen with out any real enthusiasm. That said I'm sure most typical 12 boys will be perfectly entertained, there were some very good action scenes, extravagant costumes and set design and the special effects were impressive. Overall though, the Wachowskis appear to have put too much effort in to making their imagination a reality and not enough in to making a quality film. 4/10",Jupiter Ascending
692,swefear,It's the kind of movie you could have running in the background while doing something else,5,22 April 2015,"Jupiter Ascending is visually stunning and the action is acceptable for a sci-fi movie of nearly a 180 million budget. However, this is all the movie seem to be.I neither liked or disliked the movie. The movie doesn't seem to follow that red line which makes everything fit together, and I'd go that far to say it doesn't have one. It's also rather vague in its background story.This is the kind of movie you want to watch from looking at the poster and because of the sci-fi genre, but also kind of movie you wouldn't rewind for a part you missed. You could go away for 15 minutes and still not miss out on any important part.It's full of clichés and a few cheesy lines. It's nothing unique about boy meets girl in trouble and guy saves the girl.For a movie with this kind of budget, one would expect more than just visuals. Sadly a majority of both acting and plot is sub par.Much of all this can be because of the casting. Out of all actors and actresses in this movie, I recognized a handful. Not that it's a bad thing to cast 'new blood', but in this case they could have done a lot better.If you're into sci-fi and have the opportunity to watch this movie or get it real cheap, go for it. Otherwise, save your money and time for something more intriguing. Just remember to go in with the lowest of expectations and you'll not be all too disappointed.Two adjectives that sadly fits the description of this movie is; dull and boring.A movie of this budget could have been so promising...",Jupiter Ascending

There was one lame joke about a dog that didn't even raise a grimace.The Wachowskis have surely now used up all the good will they may have had extended towards them from The Matrix trilogy with Speed Racer, Cloud Atlas and now this dog's breakfast.Boring, boring, boring.

Though I found it funny that some actors that play humans, are trying to speak Russian, but all the non-Earth humans and even non-humans speak perfect English. In general this movie was rather nice entertainment, however not so surprising as first part of Matrix, and I do hope that there will be no sequels because they are usually descending in quality trying to answer all the questions and finalize all the story lines.",Jupiter Ascending

I like how she traveled to all of the different siblings houses and cities I thought that was really cool to see how just one of them was totally different from the other one. The different secondary character choices confused me a little bit at first then toward the middle of the movie I started to like them more and more. The giant lizards and aliens also confused me because I thought they could have just picked one instead of the other but then I realized that the animals depended on who was ruling them. The aliens and lizards both went to their own sibling in the movie which I thought really expressed how they wanted them to be different. The suspense was okay but a little predictable. Everybody know the guy is going to save the girl. That's almost always how it is. The music choices were good. I thought that it really added more suspense to the story line. I thought that Channing did a really good job at playing this part. I wasn't surprised when he was portrayed as the hero because those are just the kind of roles he plays. Now that I think about it it seems like a mix of some other movies i've seen. They probably got the giant lizards from the Amazing Spiderman, the alien heads from Indiana Jones. And there costume choices seemed like they were from the Hunger Games. Anyways, I thought this movie was really interesting and just a different type of movie after all. I like movies that I can't expect whats happening because most movies are pretty predictable. I still thought it was really good and would definitely recommend this.",Jupiter Ascending

I kind of wished the movie was longer though to get more story in, as some bits felt a rather rushed and incomplete. If I had teenage kids, around the ages of 14-16, i think I would take them to see the normal and not the 3D version, cuz I don't think 3D was actually very necessary.

Most bizarre is how bad the fight choreography was (an artform the Wachowski's have excelled at, in the past).

698,blurrytextfile,Expected More from the Wachowskis,2,21 June 2020,"I avoided investing my time in this 125 minute oeuvre of cinema for five years, but I finally made the decision to sit down and really watch it. I mean, the Wachowskis wrote and directed it, so I wondered why I hadn't read many cultural references, or any at all, regarding Jupiter like there had been for a generation since The Matrix. There was a lot of potential to create a new set of iconic characters, like Neo and Morpheus, ripe with meme material, to satisfy our thirst for something entirely fresh and quotable.
Jupiter was disappointing. The story - writing is the life-blood of any good story - was so thinly constructed it couldn't possibly stand up to the heavy CGI effects. Without a good story, the rest is at best eye candy. Sure, the costumes were nice to look at, and there were very recognizable names in the cast, Mila Kunis, Channing Tatum, Sean Bean, and Eddie Redmayne. But even these big stars were incapable of keeping the movie afloat, because the story lacked cohesion and substance. It felt as if the Wachowskis were still writing as filming had begun.
The visual effects, the CGI, were at some times very cool to look at, but mostly exhausting. During a couple of action sequences I lost interest and decided to fold some laundry. The story was so pedestrian to the point that many scenes were utterly predictable, and their outcome didn't seem to make any difference. We seemed to keep coming back to the same place we were 30 minutes earlier.
But I stuck with the movie - there aren't many I have given up on - and viewed it to the end, at least to where the credits started. Netflix must have decided I didn't need to see the end credits, because some other program queued up within seconds. In any case, I sat through the whole thing, with the only benefit being clean, folded linens to show for it.
Well, Mila Kunis was pretty, so there's that.",Jupiter Ascending

Well, a fickle fie on that that. ""Jupiter Ascending"" is fun, is spectacular, and is in no way sillier than the original 'Star Wars' (as in episode IV). Yes, the gravity- surfing boots were hokey, but no more than light sabers or (Oh) The Voice of Obi from Beyond.I mean, and flipping' heck! Does everything in cinema have to be mean and retro and grungy and full of old failing and aging superheroes with bad knees and depression?

Not a classic of the genre but very entertaining - although I can understand some people getting upset at not being able to follow the somewhat demanding, fast paced, multi-level story, whispered dialogue, and unconventional narrative. I especially liked the neat blend of science fiction and fantasy and the nice fairy tale vibe. I loved those dragons. I enjoyed it about as much as I enjoyed Blade Runner and The Fifth Element. It certainly does not deserve some of the ridiculously negative reviews that I have seen. Which just goes to show it is all a question of personal taste I suppose.",Jupiter Ascending

Wondrous details on the ships or cities for instance and good scenes of actions. As previously mentioned by other reviewers the Wachowski siblings got probably inspired by sci-fi books like Dune, Foundation, I robot and comics like Corben to create this original plot, universe and populate it with cool characters. While the movie is entertaining it also contains a number of interesting and controversial ideas such as were we genetically created by ETs?, are we not alone in the galaxy, and if yes do they look like us?, is there a galactic federation or similar, etc. This movie makes you think. There is definitively a good sense of humor and sarcasms. I like this movie better than Interstellar and about the same as Prometheus. I though that the acting was good without being terrific. Ideally you would like a movie like that to last 3-4h to describe all the facets of this universe, the intrigues, and the characters more in detail.

My worst part of the film are the characters. Mila Kunis's character is so weak and uncharismatic. She honestly delivers the worse lines in the film, especially the romantic dialogue, that made we want to cringe. However she isn't the worst character in the film, Eddie Redmayne has that covered. He speaks in this quiet, mousy voice and out of nowhere he will completely explode. It felt like the writers were trying to create a unforgettable villain instead they gave us an ""Angel Boy"" impersonator. Than there's the Russian family who's sole purpose is to fill the Russian stereotype. The main plot of this film is ridiculous and superficial. To some it up its an intergalactic sibling rivalry. I guess one interesting point to this film is the lore however this is pretty weak compared to others in the sci-fi genre. Overall my recommendation is to skip this film.",Jupiter Ascending

Overall, the sci-fi aspect is pretty solid in my opinion. Honestly, the only part that I can find is bad is the acting. The guy speaks too quietly and slowly, though I think that's not the actor's fault but how the director wanted it. Channing Tatum sort of lacked emotion. Jupiter was also an annoying character.

I saw it in the theater and bought the DVD. If you want great action, a great story well directed and brilliant soundtrack, PLEASE SEE THIS MOVIE!That being said, yes, there are some issues. With a story of this epic scale, some corners had to be cut to fit such a huge story into one movie. I think the entire opening sequence of how Jupiter's parents met could have been taken out and the time spent on character development for the Cain and Stinger characters. Even so, I found myself applauding at the end and was very happy with the movie.One HUGE issue I have is a nit-picky science issue. When the ships are entering and exiting the planet Jupiter the scale shown is about equal to Earth. Jupiter is gigantic! When they show a ship about the size of a mini-van entering the Great Red spot on Jupiter, it should not even be visible. You can fit 3 planet Earths in the great red spot, yet in the movie it's portrayed about the size of a typical hurricane.Also, there are some unfortunate plot holes that are most likely the result of editing for time.Still, this movie is vastly entertaining.

708,Rachael89,"A fun, old-fashioned space opera",10,7 February 2015,"After anticipating it since last year, I was final able to see Jupiter Ascending - I had lowered my expectations after the flood of negative reviews, and so I was pleasantly surprised to find the film highly enjoyable and engaging. First of all, I'm not going to pretend the film was perfect. The dialogue was tin-eared at times and you couldn't always follow what was going on in the action scenes. For me the main problem was the choppy editing, as some scenes finished very abruptly. I wouldn't be surprised if the Wachowskis lost the final cut of the movie and the studio interfered; if there is a longer and more fluid cut, I would love to see it. But to go onto what I liked - well, it was pretty much all of it. It was corny and VERY silly, but it's part of a long tradition when it comes to that (think Flash Gordon and its ilk). The film was relentlessly imaginative and the world it established was fascinating and original, far more so than the sci-fi/fantasy universes set up in any of the Marvel or comic book movies of recent years. Kunis and Tatum were good in their roles, and sold them as much as anyone could have. I didn't really buy their romance, but they were both decent characters with lots of potential. I really liked the Abrasax siblings - they were all memorable and conniving, and Eddie Redmayne's performance was unforgettable. I can't say it was good exactly, but you won't forget it in a hurry - he was completely deranged and would have been entirely at home in Game of Thrones (I mean both remarks as compliments). And while I hate to make the comparison again, the villains in this film were far better than any Marvel villain bar Loki - their motivations were interesting and complex, and there was all sorts of weird Freudian stuff sizzling in the background. I'll definitely be buying this on blu-ray.",Jupiter Ascending

Everything is so hollow in this movie I could not get invested at all. This is as if Sharknado were trying to take itself seriously, then occasionally mock itself for trying.So much potential, so lost on the attempt to create what seems to be a sci-fi themed chic-flic with a vapid Mila Kunis hopping around saved by some equally hollow man-man.

711,mbor1800,"Appearance - great, plot - very unimaginative",6,1 March 2015,"First of all, the visual appearance is top notch. All the CGI you can have with many interesting and novel ideas. This movie will provide future generations with desktop and mobile phone backgrounds, wall posters and, of course, graffiti on the walls of public buildings.The plot however does not stand even to very lax standards of sci-fi. A great number of scenes for this film are borrowed – almost literally cut with scissors - from other not-even-so-old movies. And Cinderella"" fairy-tale was repeatedly read over and over again before scenario was written.A story-line is taken directly from the 15th century: a girl (Mila Kunis), who discovers a secret of her ancestry; a knight (Channing Tatum), who got into it for the money, but happened to be a stand up guy and a romantic at heart; a number of good/bad secondary characters that meddle with the events without apparent goal; a Royal family of complete scumbags looking for easy cash and not being afraid to fall as low as the ocean floor; and the crop circles, that at last get explained as markings of an alien space-ship!!! Mila Kunis looks like she cannot be bothered with the developments in her life and barely registers the new reality she is in. She wants to go back to the housekeeping career of her choice. Well, maybe she wants the hero of Channing Tatum to come as well to help and carry vacuum cleaner around.She does not give an impression of the person who is well paid to put up a performance, but a casual stranger who by mistake came to the production set to get a bucket of water and was accidentally filmed.Mr C. Tatum plays a knight with altered genetics, which includes, among other things, wolf ears. Those ears are supposed to help, but how so is not shown to us. If he was to wear a helmet with lowered visor it would not have affected his performance at all – he is always blank faced, except once where he almost smiles. The fights are plentiful, but things happen so quickly with so many flashes all around that it is unclear who is winning. It would be much better in that universe if they were to invent grenades, as shooting one by one toothy naked aliens with backwards knees is a dog's job. I started composing this review during one of the fights.And on top of everything the movie takes a stub at bureaucracy and promotes bribery as a way of cutting corners to success.",Jupiter Ascending

Mila Kunis surprised me, I've mainly known her as a comedy/romantic actress but I think she did pretty well in this and her and Channing worked well together. I've never liked Channing as an actor other than his role in G.I.Joe. But this pulled me round a bit, I've always stuck him to the jock/''Magic Mike'' stereotype and in the beginning I felt the same way but he gets better throughout the film and he obviously trained pretty hard for his action scenes. This film has actually brought me round to the idea of him playing Gambit. Sean Bean pops up and somehow manages to get away with playing the same character he plays in every movie! I really enjoyed watching Douglas Booth play a villain and Eddie Redmayne & his army of reptile creatures were bad-ass!

However overall i was very surprised and impressed by the movie, the protagonists managed to seem real and relatable, and even though the dynamic between Caine and Jupiter was somewhat rushed, they had a good on screen chemistry. The universe of this movie seemed well developed, believable, and gorgeous. The cities, worlds, and background extras, much of which were created by cutting edge special effects, were all incredibly eye catching. The action sequences were well designed, flowed well and added to the suspense of the movie. The antagonists of the movie stood out due to their excellent performances. Eddie Redmayne carried the movie with a chillingly strong performance. However other supporting characters also added to the overall feeling of the movie particularly Sean bean.

The plot, the characters, set designs, special effects and sounds were top of the chart for me. There is a little Wizard of Oz, a little Katy Perry, a little Lady Gaga, none of these however take away from any of the movies characters. Spaceships with castles inside them where empires have been built over vast periods of time, in vast amounts of space. All capable of finding every worm hole, or portal to transport through. They make good use of cloaking the ships in the shapes of clouds. (Something that is current buzz in the conspiracy world on earth and for those who believe in aliens and other worlds). There is a government structure to follow even though the evil siblings are willing to kill for control of the earth, whose bounty is the answer to wealth. There are many hidden messages in this movie. You should take the time to watch and listen closely.I give it an 8 because first I think it deserves it. Second, I would rate it higher, but they chose to tell the story using the female body in more provocative scenes and not the male body. I would like to have seen more of the men dipping in the pool to revive their bodies from old to young again.

Then there are the amazing set pieces, compared to Alien there isn't anything on a massive scale but the sets are highly elaborate and very imaginative with a lot to look at. There is also some funnier moments like the crazy bureaucratic sequence and the sanitary pad...

The final battle has realistic looking explosions.And yet, that may be the only good part of the movie.Mila Kunis is possibly the most bland actor in this movie, maybe in any movie that's come out this year so far. She sounds uninterested every time she talks. Channing Tatum is a bit better, but his ridiculous British accent ruins it. Douglas Booth is significantly better as the main villain, but the problem is that he either talks so quietly it's hard to hear or he's screaming out his lines so loudly it hurts to listen to. The plot also makes no sense, as facts were being thrown around about what was really going on with the battle against the space dynasties. If you want good sci-fi action, don't watch this movie.",Jupiter Ascending

This movie is the bomb and those that love the matrix series will love this movie. Before I went to see it, I saw the reviews which were all very low stars, but after watching it, I realize those reviewers were idiots, who are either paid to give a bad review, or just do not know sci-fi, or rather the reality of life and the universe, in which the movie tries to show -- that life is more bountiful than what humans have been taught through ignorant and narrow minded religious philosophies. The Movie is pretty f**Kn good. In the beginning, for a very short time, for reasons you will see later in the film, has its purpose, and you will be fully satisfied at the end of the movie feeling you have been served a full meal +deserts, by the great brothers in the movie industry.",Jupiter Ascending

Everybody had a role that they played they ran out in front of Channing Tatum and either helped him get to the next part of the movie or they died. Also I notice that no matter what they shot at his little shield it absorbed it and he returned fire. I was thinking to myself... ""set phasers to maximum or something guys !"" Even the people he saw twice came back with the same weapons and his shield stopped them again ! I think something is lost when the hero literally has no equal. Also what self-respecting bad guy throws someone out of an air lock with flying shoes ? Surprise... he lived !(with no frost bite!). Maybe this is why they called Channing Tatum's character Cain Wise, he was literally the only person in the movie capable of thinking ! For visuals this movie was stunning, special effects were great. I thought I was watching Avatar for a second when Mila Kunis was playing with those bees ! Oh look she is Royalty, now I'll help ya. James Cameron should sue ! If you can stand Channing Tatum or want to see Mila Kunis in a skimpy black dress and good special effects... see it.",Jupiter Ascending

Hopefully we'll get a follow up delving into that universe and it's limitless possibilities.Needless to say I was impressed with what in my view makes for great movies. This film has immense repeat value because its simple and looks good while being exciting.My friends and I opted to see the film in the new Cineworld 4DX super screen with 3D and it really did feel like we had gone on an American theme park ride. The seats moved in a very articulated manner complementing the motion of the screen and had jolts and impacts felt through the chair like getting hit in the back or landing on the floor. The weapons fire that missed could be felt whizzing past my head and the explosions enhanced by the bright flashes from the 4DX auditorium. When the action hits the river, splashes are felt with drops of water, I expected it, still surprising and effective. The fragrance element worked a treat too. Linking what you see with what you can smell like the flowers when a character walks through them or the smell of action - burning metal. Smoke or mist mirrored with smoke machines by the screen and around the seats creates a very immersed experience, like being in the film to a degree. Jupiter Ascending was the best introduction to the 4DX technology. Clearly demonstrated a level of experience that is sure to become a major success with the right films. I was looking forward to this film last year and, it was worth the wait. The 4DX Super screen with 3D was quite expensive but, immersing and effective so it felt satisfying with such a visually stunning film.This film is a great date movie, fun for families, perfect for sci-fi junkies, thought provoking and good looking.I can only hope you have at much fun as we all did.",Jupiter Ascending

Channing Tatum looked extremely gormless throughout the movie as if he hadn't slept for several days. Designs for set/ships etc looked like Asgard on steroids, costumes were alright at times yet could have been taken form the Hunger Games/Divergent. Soundtrack was trying too hard to be Howard Shore at times and was quite bland and lacked intensity at key points. The main antagonist was really annoying and needed a drink of water and anger management. CGI could have been done on Google Sketchup. Unnecessary giant lizards. Story line made relatively no sense and was hard to follow and could have been changed halfway through the actual filming. Sean Bean really likes bees. Sean Bean didn't die.",Jupiter Ascending

However, my sister and I entered the theater with open minds intending to enjoy this movie and at first we did. The plot seemed imaginative and Jupiter's character had potential. Some of the aliens introduced were pretty cheesy but I kept reminding myself, ""It's a sci-fi, just go with it"". The acting began to seem a little sub-par after another few minutes with a big lack of character development, but it was still early in the movie. My sister and I chuckled to each other in whispers that yeah this movie was pretty bad but we would give it a chance. We kept our giggles muted.Then, right about the time Channing Tatum fired up his moon boots and began soaring around the Chicago skies fighting other aliens with Mila Kunis dangling from one of his hands, we simultaneously lost it. Had we been alone in the theater we would have stayed and finished the movie, but we wanted to be courteous to the other viewers as none of them appeared to be laughing. We arrived at a would-be intense slow-motion shot during this same action sequence that was just too comical to handle and both sprinted down the steps and out the door. We managed to make it out to the hallway before we collapsed on the floor in fits of uncontrollable laughter.We were just in time to see The Imitation Game, so we went to that instead and though it was a complete change of pace it was much more satisfying. We absolutely intend to rent this when it comes out and finish it at home, Mystery Science Theater 3000 style.",Jupiter Ascending

This is a stunning film - visually it's breathtaking, in my opinion it represents the future of movie special effects, in its own way it's as technologically mind-blowing as Star Wars was - but also I loved the story and the characters. I was surprised because I didn't like the Matrix film, I thought it was dark and devoid of emotions. But with Jupiter, the Wachowskis have climbed up to a whole new level. It's funny, engaging, surprising. I liked spending time with the good guys, and truly hated the bad guys at a level that I don't usually feel in a film; that's what I mean by engaging. These were people I really wanted to spend time with and I was sad when it ended. It knew what kind of story it was (space adventure) and it really delivered. My wife said, ""This is the kind of movie you have to see on the big screen."" Yeah, she's right. It's what makes going to the movies great; it won't translate onto a small TV screen. I can't figure out why some people are bashing this movie. It's absolutely terrific at every level. I can't say enough good things about it. As I was walking out of the theater I immediately texted my kids and friends and told them to go see Jupiter. It's unusual that I rave this much about a movie. Go see it. You'll be glad you did. (Just in case you think this was a canned fake paid for review, I clobbered a movie last week that I absolutely hated, The Kingsman, which I found offensive. It's basically a zombie movie falsely advertised as a James Bond movie. NOT. The Kingsman is disgusting and over-the-top violent. Yech! So now you know I don't write glowing reviews about every movie I see.) Anyway, rush out and see Jupiter Ascending before it leaves theaters.

The dialogue was cliché, almost as if we were sitting through a bad teen TV movie. The storyline is confusing, strange, and for the first half and hour, I had no idea what was going on.

The scenery and equipment incorporates technology and aesthetic designs that are brilliantly inspired and drawn from the 'Steam-punk' genre. Many of the scenes were lavishly and beautifully composed, even those that lasted only for a few seconds. Many actors/actress' were from the UK and they along with the other actors/actress' performed in what I would say was a believable, natural and accomplished manner. Mila Kunis as Jupiter Jones and Channing Tatum as Caine Wise played their lead roles with much gusto. Once again Channing Tatum's role as the 'Hero' was portrayed with the physical attributes we have come to expect from him. Sean Bean's role was nearly an extended cameo performance, but his role enabled the background plot to be explained in a general fashion. All-in-All the film was very captivating and enjoyable. When the DVD comes out this summer I will be watching it again and I will not be tempted to pause it and make a cup of tea.

She was quite good in ""That 70's show"" and very irritating. Even though I am not a fan of Ashton Kutcher he was also good in that sitcom. Off topic.. 15 mins. in and its a little dumb. I like some sci-fi movies. when I was younger I liked star wars from the 70's and early 80's. This movie probably doesn't compete. This show is worse with different species than star wars.

You have to see it at least twice to get an understanding of the story line as it is so fast flowing. There is a lot involved and there are underlying plots that still need to be discovered. the action and special effects are very good but the story needs to be expanded further. It has a rich universe, a mixture of Dune and Dorsai. There is a lot that would be missed if you only watch it once.

The result comes across as two-dimensional and silly. At first, the plot seems difficult to follow, but you eventually realize you're not missing anything; there just isn't much of anything there.It might have made a better TV series, where the back story could have been more developed. Some of the most interesting ideas in the movie are lines spoken in passing, where you'd much rather hear more about that than to continue on with the current scene. Mila Kunis seems about a decade too old for her role, and the chemistry isn't great with Channing Tatum.When you get right down to it, this is a muddled movie that seems like less than the sum of its parts.

Bad acting and ""I don't care about what is going on"" attitude from the actors brings final nail to this movie coffin. There is nothing substantial in this movie, nothing that can teach us something new about ourselves or the world around us, which is quite odd for the science fiction movie. True the cinematography of the movie is first class, but it only saddens me that it is used on such bad material. In the end don't get fooled by this movie.

As sci-fi movie it introduces the viewer in a fictional universe, but it tells its history too fast without explaining anything about it. It introduces many character that stay undeveloped and you can't get attached to anyone. Even the main characters are boring. A girl that her life is miserable because she can't buy a new phone and a guardian angel good looking guy for her to fall in love with. There also so many filler scenes showing us how good Mila Kunis is at cleaning toilets.The one think I liked about the plot is that it shows that capitalism has no ethics about the value of life.I have to rate the visual effects and the action scenes 10/10 but the are just wasted in a movie with such a bad plot.

Interestingly, much like Pierce Brosnsan's character falls for a half dog, half Sara Jessica Parker in 'Mars Attacks!', Mila Kunis's character falls for a half dog, half Channing Tatum in this film! I'm unaware of half dog, half human relations within Subgenius lore, so the connection is fascinating.There is even a lesson about ""Slack"" squeezed in at the end that only studious members of the terrible cult of the Subgenius might comprehend.

740,bbatt1,So terribly shallow...but does it have deeper meaning,5,11 May 2016,"I was mad when I got done watching this movie. Like, so mad. I couldn't believe I wasted my precious little time in between putting the kids to bed and my own bedtime on this crap-pile movie. I was rolling my eyes within the 1st 5 minutes. Did I do the sensible thing and change the channel? No, my pride wouldn't let me. Maybe it wouldn't be that bad. Maybe it will redeem itself. There's nothing else on. So, I power through even though I'm embarrassed for the characters and generally just irritated at the absurdity the entire 2 hours. The visuals man, the visuals were quite spectacular. I just couldn't wrap my head around the disparity between the acting and the cinematography. Why would they spend millions of dollars on a visually beautiful film with the worst writing/acting/storyline of any modern movie? It was worse than Twilight. I thought for a minute ""wait, maybe this movie is based off a young adult book and it's not really meant for 30 somethings"". But then the butt-cheeks showed up. Nah, this can't be for 10-12 yr olds. So I resign myself to watching a really, really bad movie that only gets worse until it ends in the most cheese-ball way possible. I'm not exaggerating. It really is that bad. So what do I do? I get on IMDb to go over reviews that will hopefully validate my feelings that this movie was the biggest waste of resources since the BP oil spill. As I'm reading through, I'm not surprised to find that I'm one of many who thought this movie was utter garbage. But then I came across a reviewer that gave it 10 stars and exclaimed it as ""The most brilliant movie ever made"". Ha ha...oh I get it. This cheeky reviewer is about to smash this film with the finest sarcasm. I read on. No way, he's serious. He goes on to say that we're all missing the point. The movie is atrocious on purpose. What's the first thing that crossed my mind after viewing it? ""I want my 2 hours back. I want my precious time back."" He says that that's what this movie is all about. Not wasting your time on Hollywood BS or any other manufactured BS. Time with our loved ones and enjoying life in it's simplest form is all that matters. Do we REALLY think the directors of Matrix would make a shallow movie like this? Is there really this deeper meaning? I remember back to how uncomfortable I was watching it. I just wanted to turn it off. My husband was smart and fell asleep but I just had to finish it because well, there wasn't anything else to do. I was bored. There's thousands of other things I could've done with that precious time but I wanted to turn my mind off and watch a movie that would hopefully entertain my boredom. All it did was bring me close to tears. I was that upset. I was upset that some jack a*ses paid millions of dollars to bring this junk to the masses. Geez! Go donate that money. Do something worthwhile and meaningful with it. Don't squander it the way I just did by using my time to watch it...If this is what the directors were trying to invoke then maybe it is a brilliant film. We can't be present when we are so inundated with materialistic pretty fluff, mind-numbing bright colors and monotone characters devoid of real emotion and substance.I gave it a 5 because I'm not confident about this revelation.

744,PC_Audley,Underrated SF-Space Opera,10,9 May 2019,"In a market that loves comic book live action films, this movie should be a hit. It is beautifully shot and entertaining while keeping your attention on the mildly complex plot. I am not sure why one critic complained that the special effects were trying to wow us; I thought that is why many of us love SF films.Jupiter Jones is an orphan raised in poverty by her flawed but well meaning and hard working uncle, aunt, and extended family. During the course of the movie we learn that she also has ties to in intergalactic society and to the elites who hold title to the Earth. The overlords of Earth are loosely regulated by a Commonwealth government comprised of a military and bureaucracy. One critic complained that the villains of the story are flawed spoiled brats. This may be true, but which of us is not routinely confronted by selfish and flawed business men and women, Byzantine bureaucracies, and everyday workers and soldiers trying to live lives in the midst of competition and treachery way above their pay grades?The movie was criticized as being an overly complex ripoff of Dune. That critique is inaccurate for at least two reasons. First, beyond the movie being set in a feudal society, it bears little resemblance to Dune; and second, the copycat critique is more relevant to Star Wars than to this flick. Contrasting this movie to Dune shows why this film is not too complex to be fun to watch.For example, while Dune's arch villain, Harkonnen, is a selfish and craven psychopath, he is a brilliant not fullly successful branch of a eugenics program aiming to create a super man. In Jupiter Ascending, the villains sit atop a society of genetically engineered underlings, a lower classes each designed for a specific function. Jupiter's villains enjoy and sell unlimited youth at the cost of billions of other people's lives. They strive for perpetuation of a stagnant society that views people as chattel. It is a sumptuous but soulless dystopia. The civilization in Dune, by contrast, is attempting to develop humanity beyond its limits while preventing social collapse into a religious war. Jupiter Ascending does not attempt to mimic the Dune epic nor is its plot so complex that it has ambitions to being Doctor Zhivago or Crime and Punishment. Instead it is a comic book style space opera that reflects many of the themes of today: poverty, avarice, and the temptation to lookout for oneself while ignoring the cost to others.Jupiter Jones is not balancing peace at the cost of perpetuating evil. Instead she is a hero faced with a simple choice: become rich and forever young or protect the defenseless.

Quarantine had me desperate for new content though so I gave it a shot and was not disappointed.It's not high cinema, and there are certainly elements ""borrowed"" from other franchises... but the cinematography, acting, and storyline were all excellent. The SciFi ""tech"" and style was well thought out and original. It's a fun movie and just about the right length for the genre.

Don't waste your money on seeing the movie Jupiter Ascending. I'm pretty forgiving of most movies, particular Sci-Fi - but there comes a point when you have to evaluate the value of your time vs. what you paid for the ticket. In this case I struggled to make in half-way through and couldn't take it anymore. Picked up my stuff and got myself out of there. One would have thought that a Sci-Fi made by the Wachowskis (of Matrix fame), would be at least tolerable. If nothing else it stars Mila Kunis (for the guys), and Channing Tatum (for the ladies), but even they weren't enough to help this stinker. Not even worth the price of a RedBox rental, which it certainly be in no time. At least I salvaged 1 hour of my weekend from being wasted.",Jupiter Ascending

756,lwangrb,One of the worst films I have seen,2,8 February 2015,"I find it sad that so many people have spent weeks or months of their lives working on this poor excuse of a film. There was no coherent plot, horrible acting, a non-existent script -- essentially a confluence of poorly executed ideas borrowed (stolen) from other scifi films which may have worked elsewhere but certainly not here. In what world is it still okay to write such one-dimensional, weak, female lead characters? Mila Kunis parades through two hours wearing a series of decidedly uncomfortable looking dresses, which she seems to don for no reason besides the required mandatory twenty- minute outfit change. She ""falls in love"" with her kidnapper/savior after having exchanged less than twenty lines of dialogue, because she ""falls only for guys she's not supposed to,"" whatever that means. And the predictably horrible villains, coming in three acts, hardly indistinguishable, with formulaic action sequences to transition us from one to the next. Someone at some point must have wanted to say something! How did the actors and actresses sign onto this? I mean, who even greenlit this crud in the first place??Never have I gone to the movies and felt afterwards that I wanted my money back, that I wanted my hours back. I definitely wanted to walk out of this one, but stayed because my companion thought it might get better. Fair warning, it does not.

758,martinsphotoart,Twilight in Space,3,4 March 2015,"Twilight? Well, no not precisely but this is another movie for the younger person like the hunger games and divergent and more and more as time goes on. Since I like the genre of science fiction, to call this movie science fiction is like gnawing a foot off. One thing you don't do in good sci-fi is put in features of the movie that disagree with known science. Like saying human beings are billions of years old and were 'seeded' on Earth - so why do they share the DNA with other terrestrial species (98% shared with chimpanzees) if this is the kind of question you ask yourself then you are too intelligent to enjoy this movie.The Matrix, a huge success for the Wachowskis had some terrible science (If you recall human beings were put in to suspension so that their bio-electricity could be harvested... combined with a kind of fusion...) Dreadful - but in The Matrix you could forgive it because the concept, even if not terribly original, was done well and it worked as a movie. Here, this is not the case. Once again, there is the same notion that human life is valuable, this time in some bizarre way in which a powerful drug can be harvested from them once dead. Entire planets of humans are thus slaughtered to get at this immortality granting nectar. You might ask 'Hang on, they've been a space-faring technological race for many, many millions of years - couldn't they synthesise it? If you ask this, however - you are too intelligent for this movie. At one point a spaceship enters Jupiter through the famous great red spot. and you know what - it looks pretty small. The fact that the real one could engulf several planet Earths seems to have been ignored by the filmmakers. I love how the movie business works. Spend tens of millions on special effects - play a grad student a hundred bucks to look over the science/astronomy? Hell no. The audience is too stupid to notice. If that's not the perception, then the film makers themselves are too stupid to care. Either way, I am incensed.A scene comes about halfway through the movie where the heroine is being pressured in to a contract she knows will be bad for her and the tension is supposed to be epic as the hero is racing to get to her before it goes through. Full of cliché - a disaster. If you think this during the scene you will be bemused to find the exact same situation repeat later on in the movie. If you think you've had enough cliché at this point, prepare for disappointment, when the heroine shows she doesn't have the nerve to finish off the villain, the environment predictably does it for her. The heroine is rescued just in time at so many points in the movie I lost count. The whole film is just a bunch of bad clichés strung together.Not sci-fi then. A fairy-tail in space, perhaps? Cinderella comes to mind as we're made to see Mila Kunis scrub toilets, showing just how humble and decent she is. Why a race so advanced would need to make soldiers enhanced with the DNA of wolves look a bit like dogs is beyond me. If Channing Tatum had had a wagging tail in the movie the transformation might have been complete. No fur though - that would mess up the many, many scenes in which some disaster means he ends up without a shirt on. Maybe more pantomime than fairy story? Later in the movie I started imagining if I would enjoy it more if I'd watched it with the sound off and could invent a slightly better story around the events that transpire but even that might prove difficult.I'll give it 3 out of 10, why so high? Well, they did spend a lot of money on this film, so the special effects are in the main, acceptable. So you do get eye candy. You'll just find yourself wishing that they'd started off with a decent sci-fi novel and made that in to a movie. There are SO many good stories that have never been made but the thinking was 'it's our money, we'll make our kind of crap' I would say children and teens will enjoy it and older people if they are a little slow.",Jupiter Ascending
759,Angeloco,Jupiter Descends rather than Ascends.,1,3 February 2015,"I had a privilege to attend the premiere of ""Jupiter Ascending"" at the Chinese Theater in Hollywood where I got to meet the co-director Lana Wachowski and I briefly had a chance to greet Mila Kunis, and that was a fun experience, but that was more satisfying than the film itself... I don't know where to begin because this film was a big mess! First of all The Wachowskis have a talent for visuals and they never fail at that and I have to say their only good film is ""The Matrix (1999)"" and not the sequels, just the first one. Everything they made after was just all style over substance and with ""Jupiter Ascending"", it has style, but substance is absent. The story has been done to death and painfully, obviously borrows the ""plot"" of ""Star Wars (1977)"" with the style of ""Dune (1984)"". There were some cool and well done entertaining action sequences in the film, but they became repetitive as the film kept going. The performances were actually quite solid from Kunis and Tatum, but Redmayne was very, very over the top. Overall the script was weak, not even the cool visuals can save this film and one of the main problems with the film was that they didn't even have fun making it! Space operas should be fun whether it's good or bad like ""The Last Starfighter (1984)"". With a budget of $175 million, this could be this generations ""Waterworld (1995)"". Even ""Guardians of the Galaxy (2014)"" did a better ""Star Wars film than this. The Wachowskis have proved again they're a one-hit wonder, so Jupiter Descends rather than Ascends... Also if you do go see it, please DO NOT pay to see this in 3D! There was nothing 3D about it like most tent-pole films that come out these days! So glad I saw this for free!",Jupiter Ascending

About halfway through, couldn't take her acting anymore, had to turn it off. Thought the effects would be enough to keep me watching but it felt like I was watching a video game. Those gravity boots might appeal to the 13 year old skateboard crowd but just looked silly to me. Stinger! Really!!!! You actually named one of your characters Stinger?

763,rsmittenaar,Soulless film that's been done a million times before,5,2 August 2015,"How come the Wachowskis create something as intriguing and character driven as Sense8, and then also come up with Jupiter Ascending? Now I loved Sense8, it had heart and it took its time developing the story and its characters. It was mysterious while at the same time not overly pretentious (though I can see how some people find it a bit preachy).I don't mind character and story development to take a while, to be mystified about who the characters are, and to wonder what the hell is going on. Which you can guess, is what I enjoyed about Sense8. But in order for this to work, both the story and the characters require some time in order to introduce themselves, for us to become engaged with the people and the world. Jupiter Ascending missed the mark on both fronts.The characters are just plain boring, I couldn't detect much chemistry between the two main protagonists, which is a bad thing considering they supposedly loved each other. The female protagonist is pretty much just dropped into the story, and handles it with a surprising amount of apathy, considering how her view of the universe is completely turned upside down. There is so little emotion, it seems as if Mila Kunis didn't even want to be in this movie. Channing Tatum's character isn't much better. Both characters have to do with some tit bits of backdrop information, which only help to contrast the utter lack of a proper back story. The movie also seemed to be coping with an identity crisis. Most of the time it was trying to be a serious action flick, and then suddenly a scene from Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy pops up. It was awkward. And right, there is a love story in there somewhere...The story itself I found hard to follow as well, maybe because it too was just plain boring, and has been done a million times before. Can we just scrap the ""bored and kinda psycho aristocrat"" character from all future movies? And while we're at it, create a fictional future that isn't just a contemporary setting, just weirder, grander and more high tech? I find it disappointing that the only thing that seems to advance in most sci-fi movies, is the sci. Maybe not such a surprise considering the genre, but just because its main focus is science, doesn't mean it has to be the only focus. One of my pretty firm beliefs, is that advancement in technology is all well and good, but as flicks as these attest, it won't do any good unless our consciousness changes with it. To have one without out the other, is as pointless and dangerous as giving an ever faster car for a toddler to drive. To see this ""mistake"" being made in movies time and time again, just diminishes my interest in them all the more. It works in some, as long as the rest is enjoyable. But JA just dropped the ball on everything. Well, maybe the visuals, they were okay. So, Jupiter Ascending NO, Interstellar YES. Take care everyone :-)",Jupiter Ascending
764,swoozle-1,good action and science fiction story line,10,15 February 2015,"I loved it. It reminded me of the old science fiction short stories I read as a child.There is a part where Jupiter uses a sanitary pad to stop the bleeding of Caine's wound. She uses the sticky side of the pad to adhere to Caine's skin which causes it to act like a band-aid, pulling the wound edges together and slowing the bleeding. That's pure genius on the writer's part.The mix of high science and technology in the space ships and royal houses and then the records offices have antique office equipment melded with higher tech through steam-punk contraptions is also a unique idea. Although I have read enough Jules Verne to see where the writer's may have drawn on that as well.Over all, I liked it. I hope that the critics don't beat it up so much that they cannot write a second or third story surrounding Jupiter Jones.",Jupiter Ascending
765,heniv181,Well polished but has some direction and production issues.,6,7 July 2015,"As a space fantasy saga in the same genre as John Carter, Jupiter Ascending does seem to do try and to too much at the same time. Hence failing to excel on anything except perhaps special effects.To try and explain a world as expansive and intricate as Dune, while being packed full of action scenes, and have interesting characters and growth is reaching for too much. The underlying story is not bad, it borrows from both modern movie classics as well as mythology. But the problem is in the presentation of the core material, too big issues brushed over with not enough depth, action filling each small gap of the movie hindering any tension or interest to build up any climax.And the cardinal sin to introduce technical sci-fi in a space saga (midi-clorians), but in this case it's gene-sequences.But watching Jupiter Ascending without any expectations to begin with (as I did) makes it an quite pleasant experience.",Jupiter Ascending
766,www-bfn,Wasted potential.,5,10 May 2015,"Jupiter Ascended is one of those titles that's hard to put a finger on it. From a cinematography and editing standpoint, it's nearly flawless. Really, it's a technical masterpiece, but that not always equals to a good movie.This is a Sci-fi Action Romance, and as such the plot is very destabilized. The main problem is the lack of a villain, instead of focusing on that one antagonist that's going to drive the story forward, Jupiter Ascended focuses on a myriad of characters that fail to anchor down the tale due to lack of screen time. It all revolves around Jupiter and Cain, who are best described as the Beaty and the Beast. Jupiter being the female ready to be swept away by a grizzled warrior with a dark past and an iron will. Extra characters are introduced every 10 minutes, resulting in a mash pit of behaviours and agendas. As such, it's hard to relate to them, as their only background is given via VERY heavy exposition. More often than not you'll be finding yourself torn out of the movie to question their motives.This ""tearing out"" occurs regularly due to the many plot holes that are spread around like a minefield. Simple things like ""Why is a veteran general who commanded 2 million soldiers ending up as a taxi driver?"" or ""Why would you do *insert main motive of character* in such a roundabout, stupid manner?"", and many other questions that pop in your head while watching, destroy the little suspension of disbelief you have left after the 30 minute mark.As if to acknowledge this, the plot recycles the same devices not once, but twice, which leads the male lead to perpetually save the female, and to you wondering if are watching the third version of the first act. Speaking of the female lead, Jupiter has almost no defining characteristics, leaving her in the dust in terms of character depth and is mostly used as a model (50% of her screen time is changing clothes). Honestly, the support character has more going on for him.Finally the casting was a bit off, Mila Kunis is pretty as always and she does well in love stories, unfortunately she also seems very vulnerable in this movie. Even though the character was supposed to grow, her development (the little bit that there was) seemed stale and non-existent. Jupiter was supposed to become more confident by the end of the movie, but I think Mila failed to channel that confidence strongly enough.And that leads me to the male lead, played by Channing Tatum. This is by far the biggest miscast I've seen in a while. Don't get me wrong, I like his movies and he's a good actor, but he's a baby-face guy, no matter how much make-up you put on him, you won't see the pure ANIMOSITY in his expression that Cain supposedly has. He'd be something like Wolverine, but unlike Hugh Jackman, who has that rugged,grizzled appearance, Tatum just can't have it because of his face structure. I think the only reason he was put in the movie is because he's a popular actor with females, whereas Mila is popular with males. The whole approach was to take a look at the popularity charts and take a pick.Support actors do a fine job, not much to say about that. Some antagonists lack the viciousness required. Eddie Redmayne almost pulled it off, but his character had a polarity of being calm with random outburst of rage, which Eddie didn't do so well and ended up portraying Balem Abrasax as a neurotic child. During the calm periods you can definitely see the sinister part of the character hidden behind a layer of fake politeness, but when the underlining accent fails, the character fails.All in all, the antagonists motives were not clear, so if I had to make one up it would be Greed, which is unfortunately the weakest driver when it comes to purpose, unless the villain is really fleshed out (which is not the case).TLDR: Exceptional cinematography and eye-popping visuals, good action choreography and an original idea. On the other hand we have skeleton characters, poor actor chemistry, looping plot devices and weak story, which is further diluted by the many locations in the movie. A decent watch if you've got the time to spare, could make you think if you dig deep enough into the core of the story and find the idea behind it. Worth a rent if you have nothing to watch, worth a buy if you are fascinated by special effects.",Jupiter Ascending

That is how quickly I sensed I was in a disaster.I usually enjoy sci-fi movies and don't nitpick them to death. I'm used to being let down by the likes of Green Lantern and John Carter, and still finding them adequately entertaining.However, this was some convoluted mess. It seemed slapped together. The soundtrack seemed like some stock hack job. Characters were not developed at all. Stuff randomly jumped around. The ""universe"" seemed inconsistent, incoherent, and generally muddled. This just outright hurt to sit through. I gave it a chance, but it didn't get better. I tried wondering if I'd have liked it if it was my first movie, and I was maybe 12. No, I don't think so.Anyway, this is now at the top of my Razzie list for at least the last couple decades. I've seen a *lot* of movies.

It has been a long time since I've left the movie theater feeling this excited for a film. It left me wanting more, much more. Not just another movie but novels and other media. When I was half way through the movie I felt that it had created a incredibly vast and dense universe that has nearly limitless potential. Even more potential than the original Star Wars trilogy created when it first came out. Don't get me wrong, I loved the original trilogy, it blew my mind when I saw it as a kid. This has done the same for me now. It seems some reviewers are not happy with the acting, pacing or plot in this movie but honestly none of that bothered me. Sure it could have been better but that can be said about so many great movies as well. Based purely on actor performance the movie would get a lower vote but the experience this leaves you with and the potential it has justifies the vote I'm giving it. I was genuinely intrigued and probably had a stupid grin on my face throughout the movie. The visuals are beautiful and the way the Wachowskis envisioned science and technology in this world is in my opinion excellent. There were other works that came to mind during the film, The Foundation books (Isaak Asimov), The Hyperion books (Dan Simmons), The Dune books (Frank Herbert and Twilight Imperium board game.

I would happily live in any of the worlds they created. As far as the universe the Wachowski's created here: holy cow. It's huge, beautiful, full of opportunities for exploration. I really hope this isn't the last we see of it.I thought the story was a good blend of sci-fi magic and human realism. In this larger than life world, all of the people are still flawed, and behave as you would expect them to. The ""Royalty"" is elitist, snobby, each suffering from their own variety of god complex with their own ambitions. Eddie Redmayne did excellent. I've seen complaints of him not being ""intimidating"", but I don't believe his character is meant to be. The character is fragile, unstable, and (frankly) a whiny baby, as we would expect an entitled nobleman to be! Mila plays Jupiter as a passive, but fairly charming lead. Again, complaints of being too passive, but I think it is the realness of her character. If I was told I was King of The Universe after being a housemaid my entire life, I'd let the more experienced call the shots, too. Many critics seem to forget she has no clue what she's doing, and is taking her cues from people she doesn't know she can trust. She's no Neo, but where would the fun be if she was? Channing Tatum was Channing Tatum, he puts forth an enjoyable performance and nothing else much to say about it.As far as the plot is concerned, pacing was an issue at times. However, continuing in the realism vein, the story wasn't about ""Saving the Universe"" or ""Rising to your Destiny"". Which I think was unexpected for many people. We get a story with no particular end goal, and I was completely okay with that. Instead, we get a glimpse of the interaction of friends and strangers, making personal choices and with many ambitions, to create a story that is about the reality of a girl thrown into a world she knows nothing about.LONG STORY SHORT: Don't listen to the critical reviews of this film. It's a movie to be experienced in theaters (if only for it's visual proclivity), with a real story in an unreal world.

We don't know that she has hopes and dreams that are, quite literally, out of this world.Jupiter is also not in the least bit surprised when strange things start happening. It's as if she has always known about people on other planets and incredible (to Earthlings) technology. She really just doesn't have any reaction to finding out about all this stuff going on.

If you just want entertainment and you lower your expectations in all other areas, it's a good movie.After 30-40 minutes into the film I thought that this must be one more teenage book-to-movie adaptation thingie: a lot of characters, fast pacing with quite number of plot holes, etc. Entire story feels like there's so much to tell and film creators kind of chose just the parts they thought were most important. Or something like that.I was very surprised to find out that fictional world and story are original to the movie. Wow.This entire movie could have been an awesome trilogy and then a franchise with a mountain of spin-offs. And that fact, in my opinion, is what basically pisses off most of the critics. Then they give this movie low ratings and after that try to find 99 reasons for that low rating.There are no reasons for 6 I gave it here other than: it could have been so darn good trilogy and Wachowski's just kind of donkeyed it up.6 stars for that.

779,degreesforboilingpoint,Completely,1,13 April 2015,"Completely disappointing When I watched the trailer for the first time, more than a year ago, I expected a movie with a more complex story line, but the story and how it goes through the events in the movie is too simple and boring: Jupiter is just a clone of a queen, who harvest people in other planets to extract an elixir that keeps her and those who can afford young so she can live forever. This queen argues with her children and is murdered by one of them so Jupiter, as a clone of the queen, is able to claim her possessions which include the earth and become queen, the fact that she's queen is one of the things in the movie that's not really explained and doesn't make much sense, as the story progress her title of queen is more a business status than a political title. The children of the queen wants the inheritance because of the money that the harvest of the earth's people will give to them and this is the reason she is killed. As Jupiter becomes queen she shows that has no personality, she acts in a very obvious way, the character does exactly what any person would imagine, absolutely predictable and boring, as an earthling she works cleaning the houses of wealthy people and this may be the reason she has no political abilities and is guided just by her feelings of love towards her family and later to her loved protector, who was first a mercenary. Almost everything she does in the movie can be predicted from 10 to 15 minutes before she actually does it so anybody can imagine how boring this movie is.The performance of the main characters is poor, Mila Kunis doesn't fit, in my humble opinion, to this type of characters, and the rest of the starring actors don't do a better job.The movie has, however, very nice images of the world of where this ""farmers"" come from, the spaceships are unusual in the sense they have interiors that goes from a futuristic architecture to a Gothic cathedral. The special effects are nice, but the lack of narrative of the movie is not compensated by the good images that where not thrilling in any case.As a whole I will say that this is the worst movie I've seen in the last two years and was a total waste of time and money.",Jupiter Ascending

Jupiter makes too many stupid choices, which is averted by a ""rescue"" by the male lead. This makes the film too predictable. I will give you two example, one is that she agrees to a sham wedding to save the earth. Another is when she agrees to give up her property to save her family. Can you figure out how she gets out of these? If you said she was saved by the male lead, you guessed it right.Is there such thing as too much action? Apparently so.

The spaceships come in all different sorts of styles: from state of the art very industrial military look to stunningly beautiful insect like and also a pirate ship here and there. The worlds are amazingly beautiful. Everything is very fluid and fits incredibly well together. Imagining how a galactic empire bureaucracy can be is so much fun in this movie and reminds me the worlds Doctor Who sometimes mentions but we never get to see. Plot wise is quite honestly really flat. There's nothing in it that will make you question your life after seeing this movie. But it works.

Instead of saying something like- I gorged myself on a tub of fattening popcorn and candies while I watched this effects extravaganza, I read stuff like- Oh, the plot was bad, it would've been better if they did this, etc. etc. If it would've been so much better than why didn't they ask you to write and direct since you're so well versed in the subject matter? It's time to let movies be what they are- ENTERTAINMENT. Pure and Simple. Have FUN when you go see it, or keep your 10$ and shut up.

The action, the visuals, the sets, the costumes, the wild ideas, from original to picking up and stealing from the best of the best, all exploding from the screen in glorious IMAX 3D. Certainly a number of the characters appeared fairly two-dimensional - but there was a lot of story to cover with only so much time to be had, so bid adieu to any back-fill stories. Certainly there were some cheesy lines in the film - but no cheesier than those that popped out, say, in Star Wars. (The line ""watch yourself or you'll be floatin' home"" always comes to mind.)The laws of gravity were repealed, with extreme g-forces mis-applied. If they had been more real, they would have been squishing people into blots of jello. This movie's physics reality was no different than that of Ironman's Tony Stark hitting a tree at 200 km/hour and surviving with only a few bruises.So - I'm a sci-fi fan without being a Star Wars fanboy or a Trekkie - but I do so love action big-film sci-fi with flair, ideas, amazing hardware and aliens - and this film has it all.I'm not certain why there are so many negative reviews - the only thing that I can think of is that the film did not meet *their* expectations. Now why was that? I have some thoughts...the film was overly-hyped. After so many delays in the release, we could only assume that it was going through re-editing and it was going to be oh-so-amazingwe are getting used to comic-book heroes and amazing CGI. Yawn - another flying something or other?The comic-book fans are not sci-fi fans.I think that it's a mixture of all three, and in my opinion, it's time to cut back on the comic-book block-busters.

Plain and simple, do not watch this movie if you suffer from suicidal tendencies or do not wish to develop them. While watching this film I actually thought it was a comedy. My wife had to correct me once she realized it was just done very very poorly. Once you see the script to this movie you will wonder how on earth somebody read it and said ""YES! LETS MAKE THAT!"" The acting is awful and the aliens look just like the ones from Space Invaders. But the special effects look like something that they had done in from a free app for Android. How did this run a budget of $176,000,000? I can see where some of the money went, but where did the other $175.999,995.00 go?

785,tgv1975,"Utterly bad, unwatchable crap",1,13 July 2015,"This movie reaches that mythical degree of bad that prompts a lifelong lurker to come out and actually review it in writing. ""Worst"" is not nearly enough a superlative to describe how bad this is. And that is precisely because of the bits that people found ""still pretty good"" in it. Those are only rubbing it in. In fact, those bits are completely detachable from the whole, because we're talking CGI exclusively. The rest is no more than appalling dead weight.I won't go into the world building in the movie, which is in itself a huge missed opportunity, by the way, because there's no point, really. The story and characters (you know, the two most freaking important and sine qua non facets of any narrative, ever) are less than amateurishly crafted, they are plain dumb to an amazing degree. As I watched this, the predominant sentiment was disbelief: How did this mess ever leave the My Documents folder of some talentless eleven year old, and made its way onto the desks of big Hollywood hotshots? I forced myself to watch it in full, and not only did it not improve, but it got so, so much worse.Everything (except the CGI, but that in isolation is for six-graders) is wrong with this humongous failure, besides those measly things that are story and characters. The pacing is jerky, the dialogue is absolutely idiotic and unbelievable at most times, and the acting, oh my God, the acting - the leads act so bad, to the point you can't actually understand what they're mumbling! The acting is littered with nauseating clichés, from silly poses and stances to boring gestures and verbal utterances. It makes you wonder how the hell this movie got out of the studios in this sorry state. The whole impression is of an amateur crew's first draft of the film school graduation project, at best.Even the action/battle scenes become boring and repetitive very fast. Almost all action scenes are poorly directed, which translates into a blurry, flashy, borderline incomprehensible mess most of the time. A far cry from the superbly done Matrix fights.I see my awarding it one star as a sacred duty to the art of cinematography and to the idea of science-fiction. I hope the overall rating plummets under 5, so that this sorry production will become a timeless lesson in how not to make movies, even if you're already famous and have tons of money. May it also be a lesson to all movie makers of our days: The public is not as stupid as you think. In the end, CGI can only take you so far. Stop relying on its magic already!

The only reason I do this is that it is unbearable for me anymore to see that all the hate & prejudiced opinion about the movie. Many do that even before they see it. It may be due to the hate from Wachowskis or an they try to look cool (because it is cool to hate them nowadays). I do not care. What I do care is that it is UNFAIR!!!!! This movie deserves a much better treatment especially from sci-fi fans since it has everything what a space-action movie needs. Unbelievable quality of CGI, mind blowing action sequences, very balanced paste and incredible atmosphere. The world they created is amazing, you cannot even blink for a second. Wachowskis proved again that they are million miles away ahead of their time. What they bring is out of this world like they did in the Matrix. When it comes to acting, OK, let's say it is not the best or Oscar worthy performance but, hey tell me a sci-fi action movie which has very good acting or remembered because of the performance of the actors. Yet, this movie has fairly good acting; especially Channing is way much better than I thought he would be.

Don't go in expecting great acting or a complex plot. It simply isn't there with this one. But not every movie needs that to be entertaining. The special effects were great. Like another reviewer stated, Eddie Redmayne's acting was a bit over the top but I didn't think it was so bad that it was unwatchable. The characters are cliché as is the plot, but it's a great movie to watch when you don't really want to think too much.I would have given this movie more stars, but I simply couldn't given the ending. It just seemed so implausible to me that with access to a vast empire, she would go back to letting her family clean toilets. The movie tried too hard to have a feel good ending and it was just simply unrealistic (I realize the irony of that statement given that this is fantasy but seriously, there needs to be some realism).

The ticket for a movie, with the use of 3d glasses, which ALL movies tend to use, cost 18.96 US and the glasses 4 us. So i payed around 22 dollars to see this. The acting was terrible from Mila Kunis, not cause she is an acting genius. She has no personality, total lack of expression in general made the long dialog scenes a pain to watch. Channing Tatum in comparison to her is an Al Pacino. He did his cool buff dude role with ease. Sean beans role was meh, you forget he is even in the movie.The characters were too cheesy and stupid. Sometimes it felt like i was watching the bold and the beautiful in space. And sometimes it felt that the cast didn't really wanna do the movie in the first place and made a parody of it that wasn't funny, cause no one in the movie is even close to a comic relief. I dunno id say this is twilight in space, and its nothing for a male above 18 to see. You wont get anything out of it except irritation, sarcastically lashing out at the movie and making the teen girls really annoyed. Though there were two scenes that were funny.

(The Fifth Element comes to mind.)There's comedy in this movie, which really adds to the touch of humanity that Mila Kunis' acting brings to the film. The plot of the film was very interesting. The villain was someone that I wanted to see get kicked in the mouth (among other things) and the worlds were gorgeous, interesting, creative and more. I can't say enough about Mila's acting! We're used to hearing her as Meg Griffin, so when the movie started and Mila began talking, we giggled and said ""That's Meg Griffin!"" Channing Tatum was an excellent leading man with awesome technology at his disposal. Another thing I liked a lot about the movie was the acting of the supporting characters. There were a few on the crew of the ship who helped the main characters at times that were excellent and the three siblings were all great, too! (One of them was Tuppence Middleton and I have always been a fan of her work!) On the negative side of things, the action scenes were pretty cool but at times, they seemed like jumbled messes of Star Wars-like blaster fire and spin kicks. Usually, when I am just not feeling a movie, I keep wanting it to end.

Exotic worlds and space ships, filled with even more exotic humans, man/animal beings, robots and aliens. Jupiter Ascending is less philosophical than Matrix or Cloud Atlas; dynastic intrigues mixed with a little bit of criticism of capital and a soft love story. And, of course, the fight between good and bad. Despite many critics the movie is story-wise certainly not worse than great sci-fi mile stones like Star Wars or Star Trek. A solid story, good told, but nothing new. And compared to the last two Star Trek movies or Prometheus Jupiter Ascending doesn't suffer from huge logic holes.

I read so many reviews about this film, and so many of them are saying how much the movie sucks. Here is why I think the movie does not suck: The plot of the movie and the story behind it paints a picture of our world (Earth) today and its socioeconomic mindset, but on a mind boggling universe grand scale. It makes you think how vast the universe is, how many species (perhaps or most certain) there are out there with more advance technologies than ours, and it makes you ask yourself: ""If what they are doing in the movie, the fact that royalties harvest entire planets for their personal interest and profit, is morally wrong, then why are we humans doing or allowing the exact same thing happening on our own planet? We use each other and that needs to stop. We all share this planet and we need to learn how to co-exist with nature and all life on it. What could've been better in the movie is the evolution of the plot. It happened too fast and it felt like some parts were missing. Either the movie should have been longer in that case, which I would not prefer, or some fighting and action scenes should have been shorter (some of those last as long as 5 minutes of pure action - a bit too long). The special effects where outstanding throughout the movie except in rare occasions it was indistinguishable of what is going on. Tatum did an OK job, not an outstanding performance but not so bad either. Mila Kunis was a bit ""cold"" at times. So to sum it up, the reason I gave it an 8/10 is mainly because the plot although it felt like it missed some parts, and the action scenes were a tad too long. Other than that, the movie paints a great socioeconomic picture we all can learn from.",Jupiter Ascending

The Wachowski's are great directors, but the scope of what they were trying to achieve here is too big for just two hours.If they had given this a full 5 seasons in a television series to run its course with a limited budget and less well-known cast, I think we could have had another Babylon 5-like success. Instead we got this movie, which in spite of all the boundless potential that this story could have offered, decided to flame out in explosive, Jovian glory.So, why the 4 out of 10? The actors were decent in spite of it all, and while this movie is terrible, I actually want to see this universe fleshed out in a reboot or re-imagining of this story.On a side note, stop creating spaceships with multiple, exposed and intricate moving parts. It might look pretty to a graphic designer, but to the engineer it's stupid in the highest order.

The film has breathtaking visuals, some of the best I've ever seen actually. Some of the space shots were absolutely breathtaking. Some of the actions scenes were fun, but some were also repetitive and unintentionally funny (Channing Tatum's gravity boots). Channing Tatum's character, Caine, I enjoyed, he was bad-ass and funny at times. Sean Bean's character was another one I liked, but most of the others came of as bland, or extremely over the top caricatures **cough**eddieredmayne**cough**. I had a big problem with Mila Kunis' character Jupiter. She was okay in the movie, but I could not invest in her character. It felt like the situation that the Lego Movie was satirizing - ""You are the most important person in the world.. even though you haven't actually done anything or have any talent"". All her character did was listen to others explain things, and get rescued by Channing Tatum. She has to get rescued by him 5-6 times in the movie, and her only real goal in the end is 'love'. That's what I call a weak female character. She has a space world and so many opportunities at her fingertips but the whole movie focuses on her falling in love. I may be interpreting it wrong, but that's how it came off to me. Eddie Redmayne was truly, truly awful in this movie. I like him as an actor and he's a great guy, but he REALLY missed the mark here. I'm sure it's not entirely his fault but his entire character is unintentionally hilarious. Speaking like a lung cancer patient but then bursting into random shouts of anger. Positives -Excellent Visuals -Channing Tatum is entertaining -Some funny government satireNegatives -Boring -The character Jupiter Jones -Repetitive action scenes that go on for too long -Most characters are either bland or too over the top. -Eddie Redmayne -Annoying focus on loveAll in all, Jupiter Ascending is a great looking movie, and I'm sure it has its audience, but it's not something I'd recommend to anyone, unless you're a die hard Wachowski fan.",Jupiter Ascending
805,serra-guillem,Dumb protagonist,1,1 September 2015,"I don't usually write reviews because they take efforts, and you typically find amazing reviews, tough I need to write because I can't take it anymore.The film itself is not worth taking your time to watch it. The always dumb main character Jupiter Stones has the tendency to choose the worst possible choices each time casting the perfect silly girl. The protagonist is so disappointing that at the end, you want her killed. Furthermore, the alleged love story looks more like a sexist music video, ""muscular handsome guy who dances and attracts the stupid girl"".I do not understand how a film with a budget to carry out these effects and recreate this environment, so clearly lacks a minimally decent script and story. Don't waste time to watch it.",Jupiter Ascending
806,d-stidham,Kunis ruined it!,3,12 February 2015,"Great visuals, somewhat complex as expected, decent storyline, BUT Mila Kunis cannot act. Even when the most important attachment to her soul is threatened, she cannot produce watery eyes. She simply cannot act. The directors and writers did a fine job. The action seemed unique and fresh. The visual concepts pushed the borders of the norm, and that was great. But again, it's hard to get behind a show when the leading lady is unconvincing. It was fun seeing Tatum up his action game...wait for it. Here it comes ..but Mila Kunis cannot...you get the point. The movie also seemed to rely on some Matrix- type stretching. You'll notice the scenes and instantly connect them back to the best trilogy ever created.",Jupiter Ascending

808,hilary-karu,Really disappointed,4,8 February 2015,"I honestly don't remember when did I last see a movie so bad. I waited it for so long, from the day it was announced that Mila Kunis is starring in it I think. Yes the whole idea of the movie was great, the mythology of a trans- universal order. All the different rules and parameters were also explained quite understandably.But then... all the ""cheesyness"". At one moment, Cain is just a hunter whose mission is to save Jupiter and then, suddenly Mila Kunis starts saying to Cain that she has a tendency to fall for the wrong men and she has fallen in love with Cain. It was so bad. I am not saying there mustn't be a love story in the movie, but the execution should have been not so Hollywood-like. After that moment there were many scenes followed, when I just turned away my head - I couldn't watch it. The dialogue was terrible. I think when you watch it, you will understand.And then the ending... I understood how Mila Kunis could stay on Earth for the rest of her life, but why does she have stay cleaning lady, scrub toilets, which she hated, when she is actually rich and owns earth and people on earth can be manipulated easily etc. That is just illogical.Waste of money I think. I don't recommend to go to the cinema - wait till you can download it and then watch it. It is not that bad to not watch it but it is not good worth our money. It does seem that they may think to do second and maybe third movie also, maybe they will be better or smth. Will see.I may be a bit cruel and maybe I just expected it to be far better. I am just tired of typical Hollywood cheesy movies.",Jupiter Ascending

810,awoodbu,"Went for awesome graphics, got what I wanted!",10,22 February 2015,"The main complaints that I have seen about this movie are about character development and dialog, but in ~2 hours, it's hard to develop 5-6 main characters who all have potentially fascinating back-stories. In 3-D, this movie is amazing. I knew it wouldn't be the same if I waited it to come out on DVD, so I watched it in the theater, and I was fully satisfied. Ships flying at me, debris coming out of nowhere, awesome fight scenes in the air, beautiful and colorful dresses on Kunis --- it was amazing. Even my mom stayed awake! So yes, I wanted more character development, toobut I think that's because they introduced such interesting characters!! I'm just hoping they write a book so I can read more into the stories. You could do much more character development in a 600 page book than in a 2 hour movie. This story-line is along the caliber of J.R.R. Tolkien's novels, without the space to develop the plot. There were definitely Harry Potter-like scenes, and also areas that were reminiscent of Hunger Games as well, particularly with the elaborate clothing, bureaucracy and deceit tactics used by the upper echelon of the society. Anyways - the point is, I loved it and I wish that they would write a book or go into the back story of some of the individual characters a bit more.",Jupiter Ascending

812,dodzzy666,Complete disappointment,4,22 April 2015,"This film did not make sense to me at all, the structure of the story was bad and so was the acting. i though the creators of the matrix still have something to offer, but this film is a proof that they don t. I admit that there is some few good action sequences that are really impressive technical wise, but i could not really enjoy it as i could not relate to the characters or the world this film is set in, it seemed inconsistent and just plain silly. The dialog was cheesy, the main character seemed too comfortable with the change that is happening to her very fast, she also seemed to fall in love for no reason except that she had to for sake of the film. i can t really explain enough how bad was the acting on this one and i don t think i can blame the actors for that. They say every great director has only 10 good films under his sleeve and after that he should quiet, i am not sure what number is this film for the Wartchwaski brothers or sisters or whatever, but they seem to be loosing their mojo. May be they should work on a new Matrix as it looks like they are never going to do anything nearly as good after this mess and also the cloud atlas mess.",Jupiter Ascending

Little grey guys, half human half animal creatures, hospital visits, scrubbing toilets. There was more but I was driven to drink a bit too much and heckle the screen. So its good for that. Would have been a candidate for Mystery Science Theater. As least there was some scenery in this movie. Some old lady waded into a fountain of youth and freshened up.

Story could have been so nice, but no, they had to include stuff that could have filled at least 6 hours into a 2 hours long movie, and the basic concept of the story being very interesting, after that it is just a piece of you know what, oddly cut and put together, you cannot fully understand the story line, nothing makes sense and there is no continuity. You keep getting introduced to new and new characters just so they can put in another explosion filled nonsense cliché action scene. Tons of FXs, and some horrible final story that a 6 year old writes as a homework essay. Typical American movie. Such a letdown. The only thing that kept me watching through the whole movie, was literally Mila Kunis nothing more. It says in the movie, that when you realize the vast space and vast amount of resources of space, you will come to the conclusion that the only thing you will ever need more of is time. Well I won't ever get that 2 hours back from my life that I spent watching this movie.

The part i liked most about the movie is the path that it took with earth, learning that we earthlings actually have a queen and she decided to live her normal life and not let the rest of our species learn that there was in fact an advanced race throughout the entire galaxy.

There was way too much story that was thrown at the audience. The fact that the cast jumped from one story line to another which spanned galaxies left me space sick.SFX was spot on. Acting started to feel cheesy once the plot of the movie started to get old.If there is a movie that was made this decade that had the potential to be an amazing trilogy it is Jupiter Ascending.What a waste.",Jupiter Ascending

It is quite hard to understand even a slightest bit of logic in the story in this movie. The visual quality of the effects however in this movie is good, but the creators should have a course in physics. Movement is quite unrealistic. I wonder if my kids should watch this. I think they might hurt themselves from trying to do the tricks that looks safe and easy in this movie.

With the beautiful filming, amazing costuming, and self-aware genre typical flamboyance, Jupiter Ascending provides an entertaining ride for fans of space operas. The movie is also refreshing for its lack of sexism that has plagued recent science fiction features like Guardians of the Galaxy and Star Trek, and instead provides a female-friendly movie of the same caliber with the perfect mix of action, world building, and romance. Jupiter Jones is played by Mila Kunis as the everyday woman caught up in a grand adventure. Eddie Redmayne as Balem Abrasax is a dramatic enemy, whose overacting could give Palpatine a run for money. And Channing Tatum's character, Caine Wise, is the sort of ridiculous mash up of adventuring soldiers with angsty backgrounds that is a perfect foil for Jupiter Jone's character. If you like campy and fun science fiction, and don't mind a film with more of a female-gaze than is typical of large films in this genre, Jupiter Ascending is an enjoyable ride that's well worth the admission.",Jupiter Ascending
821,aziz-akgul,Great visuals with shallow story telling about a Matrix like plot,6,14 February 2015,"Jupiter Ascending is a visual feast with a brand new universe where especially the mother spaceships are more like old castles rather than techno boxes. I especially liked the idea of chandeliers in the docking bays.With that said, the movie disappointed in depth. Even though the premise of corporations owning and seeding the planets is interesting (as in Prometheus) the main plot of a chosen one saving the world against an evil that is using humans for energy was interesting in Matrix but not so in the second time.The characters were very shallow as we have no idea why people do what they do and there are many unanswered questions:-Why did Caine bite a royalty, why can't he remember it, was it Balem and is that why Balem talks weird :) -Why did Caine have wings, boots seem like they do the work. -Why do they have clunky mechanical gadgets if they are so technologically advanced other than just looking interesting -Why do the Abrasax siblings fight over Earth, OK we get that it's for profit but if it's just business than why is it worth risking everything, even their lives. -Why do they harvest a world after waiting for hundreds of thousands of years for it to be overpopulated when they could just take the billions of people who already die regularly. -We also can't really care about the sickness of Stinger's daughter since we only saw her for 2 seconds and therefore can't really forgive Stinger's betrayal.Also some corky scenes such as Caine showing off his toys to Jupiter, Caine and Jupiter holding hands on a world backdrop were not my thing but I guess they are trying to please a wide range of viewers.All in all it was an entertaining movie to see, and I'm sure we'll see more episodes from this universe but I just hope they will have as good a story as its visuals.",Jupiter Ascending
822,WritingGuy,Wachowski's took every sci-fi classic and tried to throw it in a mixing pot...,3,12 February 2015,"When the movie first ended I wasn't dissatisfied. There was just nothing to this movie to get exciting about. The Wachowski's took every sci-fi classic, tossed it in a blender, and then threw it at a wall. What stuck they named Jupiter Ascending and released to the mass public. Normally I'm a ""The critics always have it wrong"" type of guy but not in this case.From start to finish, I didn't feel like their was an original idea in this story.The main plot device was a bizarre mix between Dune and Avatar. It was essentially ""Time"" that is harvested from planets where humans have been seeded. It wasn't quite as important as Spice from Dune and it wasn't a solely commercial commodity like Unobtanium in Avatar. Where it failed is how absolutely ambiguous whatever was harvested from humans was.At one point the main villain is talking about the skin from humans being of high quality. In the end, it takes ~100 humans who are distilled into a 1-liter container of white-goo. Where this movie fails is the fact that something like this should be able to be easily created by a civilization that is billions of years older than the one on Earth.The sibling villains are just as boring as the movie's plot device. Titus Abraxas hires Channing Tatum to rescue Mila Kunis so he can marry her and kill her. Kalique hires a team to rescue Mila Kunis so she can hand her over to Titus. Finally, Balem just wants to kill Mila Kunis. ZzZzZz.Why even bother with Kalique? Hell, why even bother with Titus considering his plot ends about halfway through the film?It felt like maybe this one movie should've been a trilogy with each of these villains having their own story instead of the mess we received.You could tell by the performances by Mila, Channing, and several other cast members that they were just as bored making this film as I was watching it. Then you have all the actors who had performances that were wasted. Gugu Mbathe-Raw as a random hamster-human hybrid who did nothing but walk around and tell people where they should go?The trailer for this movie looked amazing but after seeing it, I understand that the studio pushed the release back in the hopes that this film would disappear from consciousness and their ledgers.",Jupiter Ascending
823,abigailthemonkey18,"Good, but could have been so much better",5,13 February 2015,"First of all, the ideas in this movie are fantastic and interesting, however the actual movie sometimes verges on boring. Positives: -the acting was (mostly) good -the plot (despite some cheesy elements) was very intriguing -the youngest siblings were cool charactersNow for the negatives: -I found the fight sequences Very long and boring, too much cgi, sometimes I struggled to see who was who. Also, any moves in the fight just looked very rehearsed and the sound effect were sometimes too much -the most important villain lacked originality and I don't know if this was the actor, or someone else's doing, but I just didn't hate him, or even care -there was not enough screen time for the youngest siblings, they had interesting characters, but they were always bashed aside for fight sequences. For example, maybe I just did not pick up on this but I would of liked more hints on Douglas Booth's character's real intentions Overall I did not hate this film but was surprised how bored I was in it. I think it would of been better if they had payed more attention to just the characters and divided the screen time out. Despite boasting to have a space opera, it just didn't quite ever reach that. Cool idea, not so good execution",Jupiter Ascending

825,kmgargano,"Jupiter Ascending, while ambitious in it's storytelling and visual effects, fell flat in every other aspect",4,23 February 2015,"Since seeing the trailer for Jupiter Ascending a year or so ago, I have been anticipating buying my movie ticket and adding this movie to my long list of awesome sci-fi flicks! Unfortunately that is not going to happen. Ever.While I understood the overall concept of the movie, it was downright confusing. The plot had no structure, no cliffhangers or shocking twists - the poor thing was bereft and left me scratching my head and asking more questions than getting answers. I couldn't figure out who betrayed who, who was working for who, where are they taking Jupiter now? And why? WHY?The actors had little to no chemistry, which is something that I don't normally pick up on or even care about. But this movie had so little emotion that I found myself relating more to the buildings in the Chicago skyline that I've never seen than to any one character. I couldn't understand much of what the characters were saying, accents aside. I kept turning to my husband asking him if he knew what that person had just said, or what was going on. Sadly he couldn't answer me because he couldn't answer those questions himself.Mila Kunis's portrayal of Jupiter was a huge disappointment, especially since strong female leads are increasingly on the rise. There was such potential for Kunis to add herself to that list of strong role-models, but unfortunately she fell right through the portals Channing Tatum's character kept throwing around. What annoys me the most is that she had absolutely no emotions towards hearing that there are other worlds out there. That aliens are real and that she was going to be sent into outer space. For someone who has astronomical charts and illustrations next to her bed and wants to buy a telescope, she shows no surprise or interest in being elsewhere in the universe.Also, the so-called ""love story"" between Jupiter and Caine was unbelievable - and by unbelievable I mean I literally did not believe for one second that they were anywhere close to being in love. Disney princesses don't even fall in love that quickly! This pains me to say, but Twilight was a more believable love story than this one...However, on the plus side, this movie did have some incredible special effects. I loved seeing Jupiter's Great Red Spot (the actual planet, not a zit on Kunis's face) in exquisite detail and the craft of the many alien beings seen throughout the movie. The set design was reminiscent of some of our lost history's ancient runes and civilizations, which was one of the few thought-provoking elements of the movie.All in all, don't waste your money seeing this in theaters. Wait until it comes to Redbox, but make sure you get another movie you know is actually worth seeing so that you can cheer yourself up after wards.",Jupiter Ascending
826,GodivaInBlue,See this film. It's worth it!,7,7 February 2015,"Admittedly, I adore the Wachowskis and Channing Tatum, and much of the criticism of this movie is valid, but I really feel like it's expectations that critics are reacting to, more than the movie itself. Like M. Night Shyamalan and ""The Sixth Sense,"" everything the Ws do is not going to be ""The Matrix.""First of all, it's GORGEOUS, so much so that I was often distracted because I was trying to look at everything all at once. I think the 3-D had something to do with this. (Other than being a little dark, I LOVE the new 3-D.) I loved the details: the explanations of the ""grays"" and crop-circles, and UFO-spotting nut jobs. There are complaints about Redmayne's villain, but I liked his manic evil, the unsubtle skewering of corporate greed.Kunis' character is kind of passive, and that bothered me, but I found myself wondering if I would do any better, a shell-shocked Earth girl suddenly at the center of almost unimaginable events. She tries to protect her family, do the right thing, and she keeps herself alive. She's not some heroic bad-ass, she's just a woman. The plot is pretty predictable, nobody dies who isn't supposed to (I thought Stinger, and probably his daughter, were doomed for sure), but that was okay, I probably wouldn't have been happy with a realistic ending. It's fantasy, after all.One thing, and this really doesn't effect the movie much, I wish that there had been a little more heat between the main characters. Their chemistry was good, with some real sweetness, but I know that if I had the opportunity to wrap myself around Caine, there wouldn't be much fear of me falling, he probably wouldn't have been able to breathe. ;)I'll probably see this movie again in the theater, because I want to absorb more details, and because it deserves the big screen.",Jupiter Ascending

The visual effects are great, nothing to say about it it was worth postponing the release. Mila Kunis does a great job overall except when it comes to survival action scenes, where she doesn't seem to put the physical effort needed to make her fight for life look real. Casting Channing Tatum was a good pick for that role, but he's acting is a bit too reserved. Eddie Redmayne is acting perfectly, I just don't understand the way he talks, we can hardly hear what he is saying which becomes annoying. It is a great critic of the society we are living in, where the whole is influencing people to believe that the purpose of their lives is to seek : money, power, eternal youth before you run-out of time and it's too late.",Jupiter Ascending

Just roll with it, there are tons of other things to pick on too but it's just plain fun once you get past the super eee-vil bad guys who probably came from central casting in days gone by, but they follow all the bad guy rules. 1. Be completely bad, with no socially redeeming values. 2. Threaten everyone including minions who while three times the size and much more dangerous looking, still kow-tow to Mr. Eee-vil. 3. Never raise your voice, be quietly threatening. 4. Always come back in the end so the hero can save the day yet again.The hero, all he lacks is a white hat but he takes his shirt off enough to forgive him that minor mistake. Where did this guy learn to roller skate hundreds of feet in the air? It's just another example of roll with it, it's part of the picture that never gets explained.The heroine, Mila Kunis. The only reason I watched the movie to begin with was gorgeous, innocent, helpless, and invincible. A typical queen of the universe that also skates in midair AND still cleans toilets! What a combination.The CG effects and amazing and worth watching this movie that we called ""a two punch hacker card"" movie when I was in the Navy but it is fun and anyone who likes to be entertained without having to remember details or where the plot is going will enjoy this intergalactic ""Perils of Pauline"" and not regret the time lost.

I think if this were a novel there would a lot of potential to build on the story and world they created with this movie. I thought the acting was great especially Eddie Redmayne's role. I know that there are some crappy reviews on this movie but personally I thought it was great. If you like a lot of action, explosions, epic fight scenes etc... I highly recommend you see this in theaters. The only thing I would have liked is if they worked the story where it left you hanging so they could expand on it in a sequel.

Highly entertaining. Although arguably not as deep as the first Matrix but there's potential in this world that hopefully would be explore further in the next parts, if that ever will happen. There's so much potential in this franchise that I would love to see. This is the whole universe we are talking about, not our own speck of dust in the galaxy.My conclusion is, give this movie a chance, it may not blow your mind as much as the first Matrix but it still a very decent movie.

Sitchin who wrote the 12th Planet talks about how Humans were genetically engineered by a higher race of aliens. And at one point in this movie, they mentioned how human beings have reached 'the genetic age'. Sitchin's work is base on Sumerian text and cuneiform, and talked about how genetically engineered humankind was created to work as slaves for a superior race. The character of Tatum Channing was genetically engineered to combine human and wolf genetics to create the ultimate warrior class. However, in the end, it shows that Channing has wings - just like the angels of the bible. In Sitchin's work, a class of angels called 'The Watchers' were built by this superior race, called the Annunakis, who many refer to as Gods. As you can see in the movie, this race is almost immortal, living for millennium or thousands of years. They have the Elixir of Life or Serum to make them young and immortal. And in Sitchin's book, he says that one day, the Annunakis will be back. However, since their genetic material is encoded in us, we are made in their likeness. But these Annukani race has given us a genetic cap or limitation - the bible says our genetic cap is at 100 years old (that' what God said, after the Tower of Babel). Some of us may have inherited their extraordinary powers, like the idiot savants whose mind functions like a computer. Lastly, as the ancient alien TV show mentions, insects may be genetically engineered, and they showed this with the bees in the movie. I hope they a trilogy. I know that what I just said probably won't make sense unless you read the book ""The 12th Planet"" by Zachary Sitchin.",Jupiter Ascending
833,kobbiesrus-198-701355,Loved it,10,9 March 2017,I truly loved this movie. I enjoy all times of movies from sci-fi to musicals but I have to say that this one was awesome. The characters were truly great and the attention to detail was mind blowing. I loved the new twist on the Caine's character since I like watching werewolf movies and one of my favorite animals is a wolf. The more subtle way they had him made is great. I really did like all of the characters and how they do mimic the animals they have been fashioned after. I do hope that they are able to make a sequel to continue the story.,Jupiter Ascending
834,si-klaunig,Not worth it. Would have been 100% better had it been a trilogy.,4,24 May 2015,"This movie has a handful of perks: 1. Channing Tatum (in Wings.) 2. Absolutely stunning CGI. The quality of the images of the different worlds is absolutely amazing and is actually one of the only things that kept me interested in this movie. 3. Relatively original plot and and characters. However for me the negatives greatly outweigh the positives. Firstly I felt the directors attempted to cram way too much into one movie. That being said, the movie itself contained scenes which I felt were not necessary and ultimately led to more confusion and added onto the boredom. The second biggest problem for me was the fact that once the credits rolled in I was left unsatisfied with giant question marks due to the many scenes and aspects of the plot that required extensive further explanations. I also feel the casting wasn't the best, I have nothing against Mila Kunis and I really did enjoy many of her movies however I did not feel she suited this particular role. The same kind of goes for Channing Tatum, yes he delivered and he makes for very good eye candy ;), but I couldn't help wondering if perhaps another male actor would have suited the role more. Overall I feel like this movie could've been a big hit had it been separated into more parts which would allow more explaining and development of the plot as well as increased the depths of the character. I think this was ultimately the biggest flaw and had there been more than one movie, I feel it could've rivaled with the likes of The Maze Runners and the Divergent series. However in it's current rather incomplete form, I would only recommend this movie to those who are more interested in a movie's visuals than it's plot.",Jupiter Ascending

And I regret it so much now. I was bored and download this movie without big expectations and you know what... I LOVED IT. And I hate the fact that I can't watch it in 3D.Don't ever listen to the others especially haters. I did not get so much pleasure from the movie for a long time. It's classic Sci-Fi of high quality with action, spellbinding love story and of course fantastic sceneries.Mila Kunis and Channing Tatum play so well that the air sparks from their chemistry. Though the idea of the harvest and price of the time is not the newest but still not so shabby as others in Sk-Fi and has lots of ways of development. P.S.

837,bertiearcher,Several stars short of a constellation.,4,3 February 2015,"Jupiter Ascending is simply disappointing.The Wachowskis' latest film is confused, creative, crazed, colourful and contradictory: the original promise squandered by schlocky re-hashes of the directors' back-catalogue and a heroine irrelevant to the hole-filled plot.Giacchino's pomp and circumstance score would fit the intended space opera. Sadly the only opera here is in the hammy acting, with Tatum and Kunis leading the cast in befuddled looks whilst mumbling unintelligible exposition.Visually Jupiter regains some stars. The extensive world- (even galaxy-) building is highly impressive, but without a worthwhile population and purpose to fill it, this creation is left devastatingly empty.Jupiter Ascending is several stars short of a constellation. An excess of imagination fails to result in entertainment or narrative cohesion; something went very wrong here.First published on One Room With A View http://oneroomwithaview.com/2015/02/03/jupiter-ascending-review/",Jupiter Ascending
838,briguy-brn,Laughably bad,1,5 February 2015,"This is a terrible, terrible movie. I cannot think of anything that makes it worthwhile, unless you like unintentional humor. The action sequences are boring because they are so dimly-lit and fast-moving that it is impossible to tell what is happening. During every one of them, I just counted the seconds until it was over and we could get back the terrible writing and acting, where at least most of time it was possible to tell what was happening. The dialog is (and it is dreadful), the readings of many of the actors are even worse, especially Redmayne. The villains should be terrifying, based on what they are planning to do, but instead they are just laughable.",Jupiter Ascending
839,anton311,Garbled Mess,1,6 February 2015,"In short: Terrible flick. Bad CGI. Crappy visuals. Uninspired storyline.Long version: I have been going into the movie theater with low expectations (after having seen the iffy CGI in the trailer) but hoping that the story line might prop the movie up (Wachovskis did do ""The Matrix"" after all). It didn't. From the beginning, the story is a garbled mess of a life of Russian-American maid Jupiter Jones (btw. in Russian Jupiter is a guys name) who decides to sell her eggs to buy a telescope. The story pretty much follows along the lines every other space opera you might have seen with elements of ""The Matrix"" thrown in. We get the exact same speech about how the humanity would choose to remain ignorant if the truth of their existence would come out, in fact humanity is being used in the exact same way as it was in ""the Matrix"" (batteries). The ""bad guys"" are all equally forgettable and replace each other throughout the movie, with the final one trying to look and act like Zorg from ""5h Element"", rather unsuccessfully I might add (plus, he mumbled more than Harrison Ford, and thats saying something). The main protagonist (Caine Wise: despite the supposed theme of the movie, I refuse to call Mila's character the main protagonist - she is just standing there there, not doing anything) repeatedly swoops in to save JJ at the last possible moment (which every single time looks like he is roller-blading in front of a green screen). The surrounding acting is equally bad with the noted exception of Sean Bean, whose acting is the only bright spot of the flick. Not only is the general level of acting in the movie is bad, but the characters, portrayed in the movie seem borderline incompetent. Prison guards lock up Caine in a cell with rocket boots on (!!!), aliens wipe memories but forget to wipe the iPhone (or did TouchID on an unlocked phone stop them?), etc. GGI is stunningly terrible. All action scenes look like a PS3 video game: lasers leave CGI splatters on the walls and tiles (a little bit of plain-old pyrotechnics would have gone a loong way in this movie), sizes of objects constantly change out of proportion (ex. Caine's size in the corner of the OR) and the background blurs at the slightest hint of motion. In other words: save your money or watch something else.",Jupiter Ascending
840,scott-kuzminski-232-305411,"This is eye-candy fun, a great summer film, which it was supposed to be....",8,6 February 2015,"I think this movie can best be understood as an entertaining, popcorn chomping, summer film, which it was actually slated to be last summer, before they decided to work more with the visuals.If you go to this movie expecting to be awed by mental metaphysics ala Intersteller and 2001 A Space Odyssey, you came to the wrong place. If you want fun, long crazy/great chase sequences in spaceships thru Downtown Chicago skyscrapers and space, and visuals to die for(matte backgrounds, incredible spaceships, colors from the entire spectrum, and a few laughs, intentional and not, well worth the time/money.)I can say I am a bit of a sniff for plots and development/writing, but the visuals and chases make it quite worthwhile. Let's admit it. We do enjoy movies largely for their visuals. Not to mention, as cerebral as 2001 was, think of all the visuals in it. Those as the things we remember about 2001. While JA is surely not 2001, it is definitely eye-candy/chase action city. I believe that is half of the reason we go to the movies anyway, especially nowadays, when every other flick is either an action sequel or a superhero movie. If I want great ideas, I'll read them in books. I don't need movies to learn metaphysics or science. I go to movies for either drama or fun. This one is Fun with a capital F. Nothing more or less.As someone said per Guardians of the Galaxy, that one was fun, much of it mindless, and was the number one movie last summer. This one has much better visuals and is far more exciting. I think this one less violent for kids as well.Again, Citizen Kane this is not, but what is now? The classic days of Scorsese/Coppola movie-making has left the building. This entire year is full of sequels and superhero stuff, as usual. That being said, this surely is as good as any of those 3-6th sequel ed, at this point, franchises...At least this one is original. Honestly, in an era and year of sequel city, more than ever now(do we really need Ted2?), it is actually simply refreshing to see an entirely new storyline(though much of it has been cribbed for fum from other classic movies, sort of a greatest hits of everything you can imagine, from Brazil to the Wachowskis' own Matrix trilogy)......if you liked the fight scenes in the Matrix movies, these are similar with obvious tech updates.Lastly, I am from Chicago. If you love skyscrapers and classic architecture, and you dig alien ships flying thru Wacker Dr. ala Dark Knight 2, flitting around and off the Sears(Willis) tower, and such, another plus. If you are FROM Chicago, you will have a blast seeing the Loop(DT Chicago) featured in a very long battle sequence that is insane good.Classic popcorn summer movie, go in expecting that, like an E ticket at Disney World, and you will love it.BTW, I think this is the best 3D movie since Avatar, and I have seen them all.....quite overwhelming in 3D. I cannot imagine someone not seeing this in 3D, only way it makes sense....",Jupiter Ascending
841,dmccoll-uk,"All in all, not bad...",7,6 February 2015,"I went in to see Jupiter Ascending expecting the movie to be a completely awful teenage sci-fi flick, but was pleasantly surprised. The cast play their roles wonderfully, the special effects are, pun intended, out of this world and the story is actually pretty good.I raised an eyebrow at the main character's name ""Jupiter Jones"" but her back story was so compelling I eventually forgave it. Jupiter is an illegal Russian immigrant to the United States working as a house cleaner in Chicago. It's a dead-end job that gets her up at the crack of dawn and leaves her with little in the way of realizing her ambition. She plays the fish-out-of-water routine quite well, and her character development into the righteously angry avenger is evenly paced through the levels of court intrigue she is subjected to.Channing Tatum's character, Caine Wise, is not as well fleshed-out. In fact, we learn very little of him outside of his past. A disgraced soldier who takes on the job of tracking down Jupiter to redeem himself and his superior, who took the fall for his transgression, Caine eventually falls in love with Jupiter and becomes her guardian through the rest of the movie. That's really about it, not very much else in the way of development, but it works for Tatum and for the movie.The villain of the piece is Eddie Redmayne's character, Balem. Again, this is a pretty meat and potatoes super-rich bad guy. But something about the millennia taking its toll on his sanity is very chilling, especially given the line of business he's in. A lot of his lines are delivered in a near-exhausted, whispering tone, as if he's running on nothing more than his own sinister ambition, punctuated by the occasional outburst that would make Gladiator's Commodus very proud. He's the primary antagonist, but not the only one. Brother Titus (Douglas Booth) and sister Kalique (Tuppence Middleton) add their own intrigue to the mix, and their supporting roles are well played and get the job done. Sean Bean makes an appearance and one would groan at the inevitable spoiler alert this would normally induce, but I, in turn, will offer a spoiler of my own - he doesn't die. Amazing, I know. Ned Stark doesn't lose his head in this one. Sean's character, Stinger, is Caine's former Commanding Officer who joined him in disgrace. I don't like seeing Sean Bean relegated to a supporting role but he and Tatum do actually make a pretty good team in this film.There's a plethora of minor characters to add to the mix as well. Terry Gilliam has a cameo as a aged heraldry adviser; Downton Abbey fans will be pleased to see Sarah Crowden and Jeremy Swift make an appearance; and as if Sean Bean wasn't enough, Game of Thrones fans can additionally get their fix with Owen Teale (Alliser Thorne) officiating Jupiter's wedding.The story itself has two layers to it. On the surface, there's the Cinderella theme of a benighted young woman suddenly elevated to royalty, which is fair enough. Underneath, however, there's a murder plot and a theme exploring consumerism, and the more insidious elements of capitalism, which is present, but not so blatant as to make a Marxist viewer blush. There's a nice little reference in there to human beings reduced to the level of cattle, but I doubt it'll cause anyone to go vegan.That's about it, really. The story is simple enough and easy to follow. Cinderella meets The Matrix is the easiest way to describe it, but there's nothing overly esoteric or interpretive to it. The backdrop is stunning, reminiscent of Asgard from the Thor movies, and there's a scene involving planetary bureaucracy that makes Jupiter bless the days she spent lined up at the DMV. It's not, by any means, a masterpiece but it is a decent way to spend a Friday night.",Jupiter Ascending
842,brock-233-555894,"Big, beautiful, and stupid.",2,7 February 2015,"Jupiter Ascending gets a shameful yet shiny B-. The lines of dialogue, specifically between Mila Kunis and Channing Tatum were horrendously heavy handed with the artificial chemistry. Its forced so quickly that you begin to wonder if Mila has reprised a role similar to her That 70s Show character- A 15 year old trying too hard to grow up too fast, much like the romance of the film.Seriously, the Wachowskis, don't guide you along an epic space opera, they tie you to the back of the car and hope you enjoy the view as they drag you at breakneck speeds without any heed to natural pacing. So, instead of feeling like we're welcoming these entertainment heavy weights back into the spotlight of success, it feels like we're witnesses/victims of a smash-and- grab robbery, as the Wachowskis take the studio and audience for everything we got. Essentially one last hurrah before they disappear to some nation without American extradition.This is most apparent in the visuals presented in the movie, which is a shame because it is also its greatest appeal and only redeeming factor. Its a veritable feast for the eyes and you are rewarded with easily the most original and vibrant world-building this year. Unfortunately, the Wachowskis don't spend enough time focusing on this beauty and instead we're forced to watch Mila Kunis and her counterparts dress up in more gaudy outfits than a Hunger Games contestant. And don't get me started on Channing Tatum's ears. The budget for those stupid things could have been better spent fleshing out a big-boy storyline.Instead we got this childish imitation of a plot: An ex-military flying space werewolf is hired by a member of family-run intergalactic pharmaceutical companies (specializing in gene rejuvenation powered by, wait for it- Humans). His task is to locate a the genetic doppleganger of the murdered matriarch of the space pharmaceutical oligarchy. This reincarnation turns out to be a poor Russian girl named Jupiter Jones, living Chicago as a housecleaner who is bored and unhappy with her backstory. Her life is turned upside down when she is located by the ex-military flying space werewolf, and everyone in the space pharma family try killing and/or kidnapping her. They all seem too obsessed with getting her to sign over her control of certain human rich planets, specifically Earth, despite the fact that they can get away with doing everything illegally. And it would never be in their interest to go through proper legal channels to get what they want, because they end up battling the law enforcement. At the climax of the movie, Jupiter (the character)'s earth family is taken hostage and they end up on Jupiter (the planet) which turns into an environment suspiciously similar to Mustafar from the Revenge of the Sith (everything ends up exploding, on fire, and/or falling apart). It is here that I cling to my last hopes for epicness. The movie could have easily been salvaged if Jupiter refused the main villain's terms for the safety of her family. She could have beaten him up with his own high tech tablet that he gave her to ""sign."" But nooooooooooo, she starts getting brave, only to wimp out. She is conveniently saved the burden of any real decision making when the aforementioned ex-military flying space werewolf swoops in and shoots at everything. Mind you, none of which ever seems perilous because the ex- military flying space werewolf is equipped with an unlimited supply of energy for his jet boots and shields. Seriously they never glitch, run out of juice, or are overwhelmed with continued overuse. Its. Just. Wrong. And more importantly it undermines the suspension of disbelief and the intended concern for the safety of the characters. Amidst this death and destruction, Jupiter fights the main villain, who technically was her son and as it is unclimatically revealed murdered her in that past life. She gains the upper hand, only to refuse to kill him, but he falls to his death anyways (because karma is intergalactic). All the protagonists escapes the planet at the last second with everything exploding around them. And so Jupiter goes back to her old life with a new perspective on everything, with the only change being that she can now be (unconvincingly) in love with an ex-military flying space werewolf. And they lived happily ever after....Despite the fact that she continues to live on a planet still probably full of evil aliens like four legged invisible greys that have the ability erase minds more effectively than the Men-In-Black. Not to mention the talking space dragons and the Luchador robots with guns for arms. The end of the movie never addresses the fact that despite (re)inheriting the earth Jupiter Jone's world is full of dumb but dangerous creatures (all of whom are SO ridiculous, that I began to wonder if Wachowskis had sold out and created them for sole purpose of comic relief and more importantly- merchandising. *Cough cough Jar Jar Binks). Plus there's no mention of her irresponsibility in not taking up the mantle of matriarch of the family- owned intergalactic pharmaceutical companies. She could/should have began the process of abolishing the horrendous practice of harvesting whole planets of humans for their flesh and genetic material. Which is kind of a big deal because that's what was going to happen earth. There are a ton of plot holes, but the only thing worse than those are the loose ends that seem to be material left purposefully for use as material in a sequel, yet they just end up being questions accidentally left unanswered. For example: What happened to the sister in the space pharma family? Who was the entitled person that the ex-military flying space werewolf attacked? The answer: We don't care. And the Wachowskis shouldn't make a sequel.",Jupiter Ascending
843,christopherwgt,Fun and unforgettable,10,7 February 2015,"There are lots of bad reviews out there for this movie apparently. I personally think that these people do not know what they are talking about. Yes, I agree that the movie does not inspire the imagination quite like other Wachowski Brothers movies, but overall I was captivated by the movie and it's story. It did a great job of developing a pretty detailed world without getting too complicated which was something I was worried about. I also was skeptical about Mila Kunis and Channing Tatum in these roles but I thought they did a really good job. It is very rare to see a movie as different and creative as this and executed properly. Of course we all wanted another Matrix which this is not, but the bad critics need to get over themselves. This is is a great movie that a lot of people can enjoy. Go see it. Oh yeah, and do yourself a favor by seeing the IMAX 3D version.

Who cares so much about the storyline here when you are able to absorb this sublime, crazy, captivating and visual stunning space adventure. If you have seen and liked Avatar, Planet of the Apes, Gravity,the much hyped Interstellar, Star Trek, Star Wars etc. then this is definitely one to be fond of. Mila Kunis is doing a great job and so did all the other actors.... how can you not be impressed with Balem?!Totally nasty wicked guy!!!! OK, it's a bit wacky at times but oh boy, we did get our moneys worth and even contemplate to see it again. We never did that with any other film we have seen in the cinema. Well, the only box set we will watch again is Breaking Bad but that's a different cattle of fish.

846,kitcat56,wait for the dollar theater,4,8 February 2015,"If you are a sci-fi fan and like action flicks it's worth seeing on the big screen, but not if you have to pay $10+ for it. The premise is interesting, as is the world the Wachowski's have created, but other than kick-ass visuals (except for Kunis' endless free falls) and Channing Tatum's body I can't think of another good thing to say. As my youngest son said, it isn't often that one movie can be both too slow and too fast paced by turns. Add to that the cringe-worthy direction (it takes a lot to destroy both Tatum and Kunis' sense of comedic timing and make Eddie Redmayne seem like a melodramatic hack!) and a ridiculously written heroine...(spoiler alert....she thinks that incredibly young looking pretty boy just has really good genes, not that he's lying to her and using the product he claims to abhor?) and you have a movie begging for the resurrection of Mystery Science Theater 3000. Don't get me wrong, this isn't Age of Extinction... I wasn't praying for them to all die so the movie could finally end. Just don't go expecting another Matrix. If this becomes a cult classic it will be the kind that involves a lot of alcohol and substituting your own dialog.",Jupiter Ascending
847,markberwick,"For what it is, it's not bad!",7,8 February 2015,"So here it is: my inaugural review at IMDb. What better genre to tackle than one of my favourites, Sci-Fi/Fantasy with Jupiter Ascending.I have to admit that I had heard not great things about the latest Wachowski endeavour and it almost influenced my decision to even see it. My love for the genre and Mila Kunis triumphed however, and so I got ready for an action popcorn flick.The movie turned out to be better than I expected, which is great because I can now add another Sci-Fi/Fantasy flick to my collection. I'm usually not a huge Channing Tatum fan, and after seeing Jupiter Ascending, I still am not a huge Channing Tatum fan, but he did serve his purpose as the hero of the story, even though there are countless other actors I'd have rather seen in the role. I understand his inclusion was not to draw the likes of me to the theatre, but rather many of his female fans that otherwise likely wouldn't be interested in the story and action but I digress...There is a lot to like about Jupiter Ascending as long as one doesn't expect it to define such important things like what it is to be human or what the meaning of life is. It's an action movie, with two attractive leads with lots of explosions and very cool action sequences. Special effects are what's for dinner here, with beautiful images of space and ships and advanced technology. All of which are usually a plus in my book.The movie starts off with our female lead, Jupiter Jones (Kunis) not enjoying her life and yearning for more. Unbeknownst to her, she becomes vital to the workings of a universe spanning industry the moralities of which are in question. Enter Caine, (Tatum) who is sent to find and then defend her and the action starts.Jupiter Ascending is very much a Wachowski action flick, the use of wires for insane stunts and special effects are par for the course and are readily apparent here. Over all, 7 out of 10.",Jupiter Ascending
848,mlcarliom,Main Character: World Building,7,8 February 2015,"I was certainly entertained - I went into the movie looking forward to something different, and certainly received it. In spades, actually. As many reviews have stated, the acting and the flow of the story was subpar, especially from writers/directors/actors whose reputations proceeded them.That being said, I walked out of the theater desperately wanting the 20-part novelization which would allow me to further explore this amazing world that was created. Yes, there were shades of the Matrix (lets replace ""Coppertop"" with ""Oil of OLay""), and certainly more action than was necessary (Matrix Reloaded much?). However, the depth of complexity built into the universe was extraordinary.I want the prequel, I want the histories, I want the next episode, I want the further adventures of the characters we already have, and I want the Silmarillion. Because, this story had enough detail to support all of that and more.Don't watch this movie actually expecting a space opera; you'll be disappointed. Watch it expecting a mostly-okay acted sci-fi action romp, with a bit of a hasty romance, and a wonderfully complicated world - and you'll be in for a treat.",Jupiter Ascending

The logic is good at first, but then you just wonder who's brain some of the actors are borrowing. Also this tries to be a romance without being a romance, Which then gives it an identity crisis, because at the end of the day its a romance that wants to be guardians of the galaxy spiced with star wars/ mixed with well a little bit of everything else.

If you did not see it already, then go to the cinema and watch it before you read further. I apologize for my not so polished English. It's not my first language, and I'm still learning it.I went to the cinema with almost no information about this movie. All I know was its a sci-fi. I had no clue who plays in it, or who directed it. First surprise came at the ticket booth. The ticket price was around 15% higher then any other movies I have seen*. This must be a real good movie... After twenty minutes I was already bored by the clichés. East European emigrant in USA with huge dreams, became a toilet cleaner, but soon she will be saved by a werewolf and she will be some kind of princess of the ""world"". What an original idea... As some other reviewers pointed out, the movie is full of scenes borrowed from other movies and video games, as far as I see. Scenes, music, sound effects. Everything. Stunning visual effects, but shallow story and almost non existent character development. For the first sight... After an hour I could not believe that I paid for this... This was the first movie I was trying to sleep in.At the end there was a single sentence that stuck in my head: time is the single most precious thing in the universe. Funny, a film seemingly completely waste of time talks about your precious time.With friends we talk about the movie for an hour. The conclusion: it is so pointless that this must be the point.Then, next day it hit me! It hit me so hard, first I had to sit down, then I was walking around in my room for a half hour. This movie is like a huge puzzle. It makes no sense until you find the corner pieces. I think I found one of those pieces. TIME, the single most precious thing in the universe. This movie is about Us, about how we live, about how we waste our precious time. Its about the clichés filling our life.The first thought of her at morning: ""I hate my life!"" Didn't you ever thought that? Her mother and aunt works dutifully, like robots. They are the modern slaves of our days. She is dreaming about a better life, about expensive clothes, while the rich girl can not decide which cloth she should wear when her rich boyfriend will ""ask her"" to merry him. We all know this will not happen, but she believes it. She wants to be a wife of a rich guy. A toilet cleaner emigrant with brand new iPhone? We are working to get money, to buy things we can not afford. Her uncle practically try to sell her body parts – eggs- and take most of the money, just because ""this is capitalism"". Spending money before you have it. Anyone? He spends on what? Big screen TV and video games. Things he can not afford, but he thinks it will change his life. He waste money so he can wast more time. ...these are just the first few minutes!It contains countless references to movies, video games, books, to different parts of popular culture, even religions. In every scene you can find parts of other movies, games, books. Just watch it and find your pieces.We are products, just as depicted in the movie. We are just numbers on some rich and powerful peoples spreadsheet. We are money machines. Do you think most movies are made for us? NO! Most movies are made for profit. Look at the movies of the last decade. They can sell a movie with a shallow story,and stunning visuals. They can sell it with an actor. They can sell it with just a name behind it. Most people praise this movie for the stunning visuals, Mila Kunis and Channing Tatum (their bodies, not their act). Here is a movie with so deep meanings, that almost no one notices. Its not hidden. It pokes our eyes. But we can't see it. There were so many meaningless movies in the last decade, we can't see any difference. We don't even expect movies with any deeper meaning. Most of the movies and video games are just escapes from our life.I feel I need to say a few more words about the end of the movie to make it round. Did you noticed, she was smiling at the end, even while cleaning the toilet? She was not whining about her life any more. She wake up early, made coffee, and she was happier when she got that old brass telescope then when she become the absolute ruler of the Earth. She did change, but not the way you expected. She enjoys the little details of the life. Enjoys her work, even if its toilet cleaning, enjoys the morning coffee with her family, the noisy dinner. For me, it seems like, she understood that time is our single most precious thing in the universe. She enjoys every moment of her life :)As I said, this movie es a brilliant piece of art. It is about our life. You just need to find a corner piece of the puzzle. I showed one piece for you! Wake up Neo! Now go, waste some more of your precious time, watch this movie again, and find your corner pieces, make your puzzle complete :) I will do the same. I have to watch this again...Thank you for your precious time, I hope it worth reading :)PS*: probably the higher ticket price was just a coincidence. But it made more impact. The pain of wasting my time was stronger.",Jupiter Ascending
853,bradjlevin,Uranus Descending On My Face,2,10 February 2015,"Jupiter Ascending is so bad it should be renamed Uranus Descending On My Face!!! I feel so embarrassed for the actors in this film who over acted to the point that I wasn't sure whether they were actually joking or not?!? The unintentional Kung-Pow of the Sci-Fi Genre, so awful that it makes you burst out laughing. What was Eddie Redmayne doing?!? He seemed to be trying to pull off a pompous Bane accent and just came out looking like a joke, I couldn't take him seriously at any point of the film whatsoever... The fact there are people on here rating this steaming turd pile higher than a 2 or a 4 makes me start questioning the validity of these ""critics."" By his own admission, Channing Tatum isn't a good actor, so at the very least he could have gone to the gym to pull off his genetically-enhanced-bred-for-war wolf/human/angel-winged hybrid; but instead he looked like he spent his training hours on the couch eating Doritos with Jonah Hill. This Cinderella Story of the Galaxy is the skid mark on the panties of The Wachowskis career thus far.",Jupiter Ascending
854,kemebo,"Great SFX and visuals, just as you'd expect from Wachowskis",5,10 February 2015,"Once again the Wachowskis deliver yet another visually stunning epic but for some reason fall short to hit the mark with the story itself, it's almost as if they are still trying to top or meet the level of expectation from their groundbreaking masterpiece The Matrix. Jupiter Ascending has so many complex parts that where not fully explained or explored one of which is evident in the very first scene of this picture, some of the characters were superfluous and therefore distracted from the power of the overall story. The antagonist was stagnant but had so much potential. I hope they take clues from movies like Guardians of the Galaxy a clean direct space movie that pulls u in not only with visuals but engages you making feel the plight of each character. I hope if there is a sequel they focus more On the storytelling rather than the fantastic (as much).",Jupiter Ascending
855,necjones6,"Amazing action, won't get bored, but may get detached",8,10 February 2015,"I enjoyed this movie, but the characters needed to be developed more.Characters came up and it felt as if they were just there, and you didn't really feel them in the plot.The fight scenes lasted what seemed at times to be unreasonably long.But, it wasn't all that bad considering the action was intense and definitely interesting. Yet, it seemed as if you didn't get to know the characters too well and they had feelings for each other backed up by nothing. Despite the negatives of this review, I recommend this movie because its action you won't want to miss, but waiting for it to come out on demand or DVD may be your best option.",Jupiter Ascending
856,ivoryblake,It's a wonderful wonderful world.,8,11 February 2015,"I went to see this movie with zip expectation knowing absolutely nothing about it (hubby wanted to see it), and actually I liked it. It's not perfect, sure. The carachters are horribly stereotyped and static, the pacing is somewhat lame, and it does have eye-wateringly clichéd scenes, but hey, find me a big movie out there that does not share these faults to some extent! It is beautifuuuly made however, with incredibly elegant action and interesting concepts all over. I like the male lead (actual scifi eye candy for the ladies, for once! wink wink), and I like that the miss is a cleaning lady ( I can relate), although I don't think that anyone there, from the actress to the directors, ever cleaned a toilette in their life. Maybe it is not as creepily thought provoking as the Matrix or V, but all in all, I thought it was a perfectly enjoyable action movie with a beautiful universe I'd like to explore further. And I don't think the love story encroached to much on the scifi, rather the contrary. *********** SPOILER ************You GOT to see this movie. Sean Bean made it all the way to the END!",Jupiter Ascending
857,ideologyx,"It was a great idea, but it could have been much...much better",6,12 February 2015,"I went to see the movie in 3-D about a week ago, and my main reason for doing so was to see the graphics and animation. That side of things is easily a 10 out of 10 and the costume designs were phenomenal. It's probably one of the best visuals to come out since Avatar but still, it's nothing close to that feat. However, the acting was just okay, and the character development for Jupiter really REALLY sucked. I can't believe that didn't cast her better. That was one thing could have made the movie so much better. There was some great acting by Eddie Redmayne as Balem Abrasax. I think that his character was by far the best and most precise and had he not been in the movie, I'd have only rated it a 2 out of 10. By the end of the movie, I was satisfied, but something was missing. Had the writers added another fifteen minutes at the beginning of the movie where Jupiter and the audience were explained what was happening more than they did in the actual movie, I would have given this movie a better rating. I guess I should also say that Jupiter was WAY too accepting of everything that was going on. Her lines were corny and stupid and the movie would have been way more of a thrill with better writing on that character's behalf.Well I think that's about it.",Jupiter Ascending
858,wctrumble,A must see,9,12 February 2015,"Just came back from seeing this movie and I loved it. I gave it a 9 so that movie productions will always strive to shoot for the moon. The action was wild all the way through like a visually stunning roller coaster ride. Mila Kunis is so beautiful and she plays the part perfectly. Casting was good, no goofy recycled actors from movies or TV shows although Channing Tatum was in it, he was good. They should have put some makeup on him so we didn't know it was him but then he would be too alien-like. One thing I must add is - who writes negative reviews for movies like this? I can't understand how someone could not like this movie. What kind of movie would impress these naysayers? A billion-dollar production. Sometimes I miss a movie because of the bad reviews so if you're a movie buff, go with your instinct and check it out. Simply, there are simple people out there who cannot appreciate a good thing. The next time I read a negative review, take it with a grain of salt. This movie is a must see....enjoy.",Jupiter Ascending
859,fastacuda,an ambitious world that blows you away!!,9,13 February 2015,"I will start by saying I was very pleasantly surprised by this movie. I was completely immersed in this creation by the end and left wanting more. The universe, as envisioned by the Wachowski's, is amazing. Visually stunning and full of new creatures, ships, weapons, and world's. While the character's may not possess the depth that some are dogging this movie for, they are just deep enough to make you cheer for them. The really brilliant part of this film is that you leave the theater having your mind opened once again to the possibility of a universe so much larger than most of us dare to dream about. I just hope the film does well enough at the box office to invite more and deeper stories from this verse.",Jupiter Ascending

I had only seen the trailer a few times and didn't quite know what to expect going in. I was surprised to be blown away by the intense action, intricate story line, and interesting technology that just made me jealous. There were a few oh yea scenes, but overall this show was incredible, and in IMAX 3d it made me appreciate the depth of it, especially in the special effects space scenes. Jupiter itself was incredible. Overall I give this an 8 out of 10, simply because the acting could of been better at a few spots, other then that, excellent 2015 movie, especially from the creators of the Matrix. I wasn't disappointed when my girlfriend and I checked this show out for Valentines.",Jupiter Ascending
861,ampub,exciting and beautiful,9,15 February 2015,"This film lives up to the high standard that the Wachowski's have established with their previous films. The vision is vast and inspiring.

The cast and characters are brilliant, as are the directors (as usual).Loved the music.Loved the dialog.If you love the adventures that we've taken with Andy and Lana in the past.

862,ebvillarreal,Newly discovered princess and bounty hunter team up to save the earth from galactic forces.,10,15 February 2015,"Mila Kunis' character is a nontraditional hero that makes hard choices to try and save the world. Channing Tatum is not only a space werewolf but he has a really tender, supportive relationship with someone he could have overwhelmed or scared into compliance while still having several dynamic fight scenes.There are action sequences that believe gravity is a little irrelevant and are just a lot of fun to watch. The visual aesthetics are intense and beautiful.There are creeper villains you can love to hate.The message of the movie is that every life matters and has value.In summation: Go watch Jupiter AscendingIn greater detail, I will say that some people have found it confusing but it seems like that is an intentional directorial choice. You only know about as much as the protagonist does. She is thrown into an entirely new world and is a little lost, very ill informed and is doing her best to navigate a confusing and dangerous environment. By experiencing almost everything through her lens, you are experiencing a very similar process of trying to piece together this very big world. There are a lot of both subtle and unsubtle questions about a being's value in a system that is literally built on manufacturing, selling and consuming people. It sort has a little bit of a fairy tale feel with Jupiter, the main character, interacting with three characters that test and tempt her in different ways. She learns a piece of the ultimate lesson in each sequence. Some critics haven't liked this structure but I think it's very resonant with basic folklore/storytelling logic.Also, if female representation is important in your movie going choices, this movie is a multiple Bechdel test pass. Also, the female lead is strong and intelligent and decisive without having to conform to a BA warrior trope. It was actually really refreshing. Channing Tatum's character Caine may physically rescue her in a couple of tight spots but she never stops working to save herself or the people she cares for. If representation of people of color is something that influences your moving going choices, this movie is not problem free but it is leagues ahead of most Hollywood sci-fi and has multiple named, complex characters of color (actually human, which often needs to be clarified in sci-fi) including in positions of authority. It is unapologetic and un-ironic. The romance is cheesy but not any cheesier than in The Fifth Element. Actually, you'll feel a lot of familiar influences. If The Fifth Element, the Wizard of Oz, Serenity and Star Wars invited all their friends over, had an orgy and made a baby this movie would be that baby. It is an homage to a less self-deprecating era of sci-fi and it is enjoyable and thought provoking and a little bit silly. In summation: Go watch Jupiter Ascending!",Jupiter Ascending

Some of the visuals were okay, but became very repetitive. They got the right ethnic mix to assuage the racialists. This isn't science fiction (I should have researched more before I went). Of course there was the ubiquitous jab at capitalism and profit. How are those Cuban and North Korean space programs coming along? Do they think it goes unnoticed? This is really a silly teenage fantasy romp for the millennial crowd I suppose. I'm cant imagine how anyone could empathize with the main character. What a waste.

No, you go to watch the movie and soak it all in, digest it, analyze it and figure out the hidden message. And oh are they good at at. Cloud Atlas was not a hit a the box office, primarily because people did not get the message. The Matrix was a hit because of the innovative use of SFX and never before seen action sequences. But it took a long time for people to get the message. If you want to go see this movie and do not want to think, than this movie is not for you. This is clearly a reaffirmation of the message of the matrix. It is chock full of esoteric symbolism, astrology and occult messages. If you are into Astrology, the occult, and esoteric symbolism, this is a 10+. Wake up people, they are trying to tell you something!

Despite the movie best efforts to explain the back story, it just hard to grasp in 2 hours.Despite it's best efforts to appear original, it seemed far from it. It was as if many of the elements of this movie were taken from other flicks, such as Transformers 3 (I.e. Chicago battle), Guardian of the Galaxy, Star Wars, Iron Man, and Dune (But instead of spice, they harvest people).On the plus side, I was impressed with Channing Tatum performance.

There are parallels drawn between the 1-billion old human civilization and our current one.

I sat thru the whole movie without falling asleep which is good. Some of the action shots could have done with being in slow motion, as it was almost a blur with speed, & a bit of a waste of the amazing fight scenes. Anything looks good in slow motion, and it really is a shame to have good looking actors leaping about too fast to see properly. I'm struggling for 10 lines here. I hate picking things to bits as the total is more than the sum of the parts. It had a very good cast,and they did not disappoint. It didn't leave me with a great insight into life, but I don't want that from a film, I like to come out feeling I've had a shot of adrenalin, & this film did that for me.

Even at the end, after growing a pair & beating up the bad guy, she still needed the hunk to swoop in & save her. She's like Lois freaking Lane. And said hunk, Channing Tatum? Still the 3rd worst actor in Hollywood. Dude, with all your money, hire someone to show you how to display more than one emotion!

Mila Kunis is the acting equivalent of beige, there is just nothing there that makes you sit up and think 'what a great piece of acting'. Channing Tatum is just Channing Tatum, dumb and all the charisma of a piece of wet lettuce. Eddie Redmayne has gone from the acting master class of Theory of Everything to a mildly camp and whispering 'villain'. The script is ludicrous, you cannot gloss over it. It was a film that could have delivered a lot if managed correctly but they have shown that the original Matrix film was an anomaly as it is the only film of any note that actually delivered on all levels. I have seen some shoddy films in my time, Battle Los Angeles and the acting chin that is Aaron Eckhart springs to mind, and it is a battle between these two which gets my worst ever movie I have ever seen award.

Yes, you got to go with in. It does seem chopped or cut to make it shorter BUT the ride is worth it for the 3 of us that saw it. I must admit I am a fan of the Wachowskis's work and admire their willingness to push the envelopes in the over the top aspects. Do you want cookie cutter Marvel movies out the gazoo? Go watch as a fun escape as a popcorn escapists movie to another world. And the other worlds they have created are visually stunning.

And it left me with a difficult to explain joy. There are many unresolved plot threads and a circular journey that is unfamiliar to our brains so used to ""the hero's journey"" narrative that is so pervasive in all of our media... and it's just so, so much FUN.This will be sharing shelf space with Princess Bride and The 5th Element.

Also, many questions were left unanswered concerning the plot and the main characters, Jupitor Jones and her accomplice. It is unfortunate to see that such a high anticipated movie fell flat, and I am sure that other reviewers would agree with me.

878,Alphabetar,Ew....,1,28 February 2015,"This movie is pretty random and makes no sense over all, it's full of arbitrary plot twists and interjections. It somewhat reminds me of a bad Twilight fan fiction mixed with a little bit Matrix and a table spoon of Star Trek. We have a really retarded Heroine that is supposed to be the reincarnation of an Alien Queen, which has been killed by her own eldest in order to inherit the 'Human-Juice-Lazarus-Pit- Refineries' and rights on one of the biggest farms of their resource (humans) - Earth. Anyways ""Mother"" had 3 children that are now, wooing for the rights on earth. We don't know how but all of a sudden they become aware of Heroines (the Genetic Reincarnation of ""Mother"") existence, and start hunting for her. Now this is where the cheap chick flick begins. We get: - A stupid Princess Peach that needs to be rescued by Mario (aka Kain) around 3 to 4 times. - Stupid Peach almost sealed Earths doom in randomly dramatic acts such as, an incestuous marriage (Oedipus-Complex). - Now the random super splice soldier Mario (starring as Kain) is able to breach the protection-shields of some random place hidden in gas fog, which up until now was able to withstand laser torpedoing or an incoming spaceship that tried to force it's way into the gate, with one teeny weeny space-crafter. That of course destroyed the whole enemy ship\colony(?) on Jupiter (?) in one go, *wink* single- handedly. Etc. anyways, Heroine is able to survive due to Kain, and now back on HER PLANET Earth and decides to further peruse her toilet cleaning career, with PASSION and LOVE. Of course she would never think about using her position as a Royal Alien Aristocrat in order to stop the exploitation of other planets and their residents for the""HONEY OF YOUTH"". *dun dun duuuun* The final scene shows that our beloved Mario\Kain was able to regain his precious black splicer wings (that were taken from him prior to some violence issues). And of course our Princes Dumb-Peach and Mario-Dark-Angel are now having a hot make out session on top of the alien transmitter mast, which apparently happens to be a skyscraper in NY.Oh and did you know that bees are able to detect Alien Queens? That gives the phrase of being the ""Queen Bee"" a whole new meaning. Fascinating!Overall the film was awful.

This film's aesthetics are sublime, its message for our status obsessed culture is enjoyably subversive and the romance is amusingly predictable. For me it was like the kind of film Samuel Beckett would have made if he were a visual genius who loved sci-fi. The fact that many parts of the story seem unfinished is part of its structure and message. I don't know what the critics mean when complain the film is confusing. It is ultimately a very simple personal story. There is no confusion if you don't expect neat story lines for the wider political game and pat explanations for all aspects of human (and quasi-human) behaviour.

Talking about female power? Well she just gets saved by her loved one over and over.

882,boattrailermonkey,"The story is told as a book, not a movie",8,5 March 2015,"I figured out why I disagree with the critics who say that Jupiter Ascending is fast pace and confusing. All of the film critics are used to watch films, specifically American films, that spell everything out and lead you through the movie by the hand and explain everything along the way. However, I'm used to reading books. Specifically, books that don't tell you what the bad guy is doing, or explaining everything that is going on until either needed, or the end where it all comes together. So to me, Jupiter Ascending makes perfect sense because it is told in the style of a book, where the main character is thrown into a new world and isn't told all of the rules, because everyone else in the new world already knows the rules and doesn't think about explaining them to the main character because they know whats going on. There also isn't a need for the bad guy to spend and hour mono-logging his/her secret evil plan because the plan unfolds during the story giving the viewer hints of what the plan is, instead of the plan unfolding all at once.So yes, as an American movie, Jupiter Ascending is a confusing series of events that leaves the viewer wondering what is going on. As a film adaptation of a book, it follows the book story telling style and leaves the reader/viewer wanting to know whats going to happen next because you are unsure of the situation and want to continue reading/watching to find out.",Jupiter Ascending

There were lots of bits where you also felt there were holes in the plot. Without giving away the story or anything pivotal, some bits of the story weren't explained (why bees?) and some bits you just felt like things just happened in the wrong sequence.They either tried to squeeze too much plot into one film, or I think more likely, this should have been 2 films.

I recently watched the movie, and am going to see it again today, because I absolutely loved it.

The chemistry of the main characters, Mila and Channing, really came through. There were also a colorful array of characters and you have a feel that this is something like ""The HitchHiker's Guide to the Universe"", and ""Fifth Element"". If you like both of those movies, especially ""HitchHiker's Guide to the Universe"" then you'll dig this.The CGI-effects were outstanding. Originally, when I went on IBDM, I saw a 5.9 average rating and thought this was going to be some lame crazy or weird sci-fi movie. However, I think the director created a balance so the movie goer would not feel overwhelmed but enjoy the CGI-effects with a creative and witty story that doesn't insult anyone's intelligence. At the end of the day, I recommend if you can see this on the big screen on 3-d as an AMAZING movie that settles well after the movie is finished.

This film looked like it had real potential in the trailers. It seemed to have a bit of a Riddick style and a bit of a Star Wars story. Unfortunately it doesn't live up to any of the promise from the trailers. By the end I was painfully bored. There were so many problems I don't even know how to articulate them all without wasting a bunch of my time ranting. The love story didn't make any sense at all, she basically falls for the first guy to hold her hand and trusts him implicitly from that moment. We watch as an established futuristic society full of rules and protocols moves things along only to witness how they ignore all those same protocols later. Why spend 15 minutes of a film having us watch the actors wait in lines to obtain ""citizenship/title"" only to have all the rights of those titles ignored and fought over.... Couldn't you have just given them automatic citizenship and moved the story along???What was the point of the massive battle scenes with so many characters? We never got a chance to learn the backstory for their universe so we never got emotionally invested in the story. I'm done. Don't see this movie, it's a waste of your time.

889,neverever-45397,Fantastic Idea but rushed execution,8,22 April 2015,"This movie is incredibly entertaining...visually. If you love special effects then you will love this movie. But thats to be expected from any Wachowski film I'd venture. Jupiter Ascending has scenes reminiscent of great Sci-fi flicks like John Carter, Hitchhikers Guide to The Galaxy, Chronicles of Riddick, and even Star Wars. The problem is that, being only one two-hour film, it has so many great ideas that it never gets a chance to develop them fully. The storyline felt rushed in order to get everything into one film and as a result too many gaps in back-story and character development were left wide open. This film easily could have been an epic two-part space saga. In fact their was even a natural break in the storyline a little over half way through, at the end of the wedding scene. If it was the production company's doing by refusing to take a gamble on a two-part series and forcing it into one film then shame on them. All that being said, the film scores big in the ""fresh idea"" column. Maybe not completely a new, fresh idea but definitely a great combination and redevelopment of previous ideas made in a new direction. If you liked any of the Sci-fi movies listed above then you will find this movie entertaining but beware because it will also leave you wanting more.",Jupiter Ascending

The special effects were very strong, but were overused - there were multiple 5+ minute long fight scenes with nothing but special effects and slow-down zoom mode. The destruction scene of the harvesting factory at the end was a complete waste of time and was not well thought out. But the story is inexcusable. It tries to cram what would have been days/weeks/months of falling in love, fighting, travelling to other planets, dealing with their DMV, learning their laws, etc... into a 90+ minute movie. The double-crosses get triple-crossed to the point where you don't know who is doing what, but you do know that everyone (except for her true love) is trying to kill her. You don't know why - but you don't need to know. The ending could not be worse, and caps off the movie with the same trite writing that plagues the rest of the movie.

892,neberlev,"A sprawling, confused mess.",2,26 April 2015,"If you take Flash Gordon, surgically remove its heart and soul, fire Brian Blessed, shave Ming the Merciless, and then update what is left with generic CGI nausea, you have a good starting point for understanding why Jupiter Ascending is so bad.The plot is driven by the re-emergence of the Empress of the House of Abraxas. Through a bizarre interpretation of genetics, where identical DNA equates with reincarnation, earthborn Jupiter Jones (Mila Kunis) is actually heir to an intergalactic empire. Strangely, this implies that monozygotic twins are actually the concurrent reincarnations of one another. In a film where almost nothing makes sense, this oddity is barely a blip on the radar. Lets look at some of the more serious problems.Firstly, and almost fatally: the passive protagonist. Perhaps we should commend the Wachowskis for going with a female lead. But the gesture seems empty when our heroine is dragged, often literally, from exposition to exposition, as a bewildered passenger in her own film. She is a pawn, played over and protected by the mainly male co-stars, who between them, drive most of the action. In a period where cinema has managed to produced many teen franchises that successfully place a female at the centre of the action we should, in my opinion, expect more.The main protagonist then, in a practical sense, is Caine (Channing Tatum), a genetically modified half-human, half-wolf (with wings?), who skates around on rocket boots doing his best to save Jupiter in almost every action sequence. Incidentally, and amusingly, Caine's sense of smell is so refined that he can pick out individual genes and track them across the galaxy. Yes, apparently that is where science-fiction is at in 2015.Storytelling 101 tells us that audiences find it hard to connect with a inactive lead. Perhaps with a pedigree script and time set aside for character development this bias could be overcome. However, the script, both in its structure and dialogue, is the downfall of the movie. Jupiter and Caine face each of the main antagonists in turn, with the transitions between them feeling completely arbitrary. The result is that film continues to render itself pointless as we move from one confrontation to the next.I could say a lot about the poor dialogue and characterisation but lets focus on a couple of key points. The relationship between the two main protagonists is completely flat. Despite any trace of on-screen chemistry, our leading lady declares her love for part-wolf Caine before I've managed to stop chuckling over his dyed eyebrows. It's a move that feels completely out of place. However, given what they have to work with, most of the performances are passable. I say most, because, well Lets talk about Eddie Redmayne, or more precisely, lets talk about his lips. For some ungodly reason his lips are offered towards the camera at every opportunity, in a way uncomfortably reminiscent of that drawn out moment your granny waits, taut and over-eager, for a proper kiss goodnight. As has been mentioned, I'm sure, in almost every review, that the performance is an abomination. It's Ming and Queen Mother, and a tremulous Mick Jagger, and when he's enraged we are treated to strains of an aged Stallone. It can't be entirely Eddie's fault. There are missteps in so many aspects of the films production that most of the blame has to be placed at the feet of the Wachowskis.The Wachowskis then. They throw in allusions to various science-fiction influences. The result is a mismatch of styles that, for me at least, grates. Like when children tip the contents of their toy box out onto the floor and proceed to play with their Lego, Transformers, Star Wars, Power Rangers, and My Little Pony figures all at the same time. Cute, fun-loving, naive, soulless children. Thank god we don't let them write motion pictures.And then there is Brazil. For reasons I still can't quite fathom, we are served up an interlude on the bureaucratic complexities of being officially recognised as a monarch. For this we delve into the world of Gilliam's Brazil, with Gilliam himself, dressed up like a Gringotts' Goblin, ready to rubberstamp the final forms. Why? I did begin to wonder if there was a point being made somewhere amongst the sprawl that is this film. There are certainly moments where typical anti-things-everyone-is-anti dialogue presents itself. But, afterwards, and upon reflection, I don't think there is a coherent message unless it is: ""if you spend a large amount of time cleaning toilets, stick to it and be happy, because you're probably not capable of doing anything more demanding anyway."" Which is actually what the film appears to be saying, although I admit probably not intentionally. (OK, I also admit that may be a fabrication on my part.) Is there anything positive to say? Well, it looks pretty. If pretty is the standard were using to evaluate cinematography these days, then I suppose that's a positive. It's never entirely dull. But this feels like a technicality. It's not part of some awful franchise, and I guess now it never will be, although it feels wrong to call it original. It's definitely not a bad as John Carter.

Everyone hates the script, everyone hates the acting (I have to agree a little on that) everyone says it's meaningless and boring and long.But that is just NOT my personal experience. I personally like the work done by the Wachowski Brothers so far. I like how they're trying to do something imaginative and interesting and new.On a technical side, the film is proficient, the worlds created are beautiful and the fight scenes brilliantly executed. The script follows a good idea but unfortunately it's full of silly dialogs and situations. But then again, many, many sci-fi films suffer from that too. The acting is also not very good though i didn't hate it either, with the exception of the main villain. It's definitely overacted.If i had to pick the worse thing about this film, it would be the length. Many things happen and though the film is quite long, it feels crammed and rushed sometimes. It should either be longer or better yet, a two part movie.I have read a few reviews and as always some people love one scene, some hate it. All i can say is this: I had a good time.

To actually build more on the great cast and characters that were in the movie. It was almost information overload to pack into 2 hours. That is why I watch it 3 times to absorb all the subtle plot categories. In 2 parts the cast could have had a chance to build on their personalities.

The visuals are stunning and the world introduced is actually pretty cool...if a little nonsensical. (She owns the earth and just goes back to cleaning toilets? Really?) The dialogue and some concepts in the movie will actually have you laughing quite hard without meaning to. From Jupiter's affinity for dogs to the trumpeting of a half elephant man leading a charge into battle, Jupiter Ascending is not technically a good movie but can still be a fun watch (especially with friends) just to witness a couple hours of some of the weirdest storyline you've seen.",Jupiter Ascending
907,hannahfilmer,Jupiter what?,3,22 July 2015,"I finished watching this movie thirty minutes ago, and if you asked me what it was about tomorrow I wouldn't be able to tell you a single thing. A very generic and over told storyline about someone discovering they arn't who they think they are, falling in love with someone they shouldn't and ending up happy as larry at the end, is told through an absolute maze of boring CGI action scenes and snippets of information you are just supposed to string together, whilst having your visual field bombarded by more CGI action. There are a number of features in the film which in the long run are irrelevant but confuse you non- the less, such as Caine's wolf DNA which is hurriedly explained and leaves no lasting impact upon the story line, a cheap shot at character development in my mind. Which this film lacks enormously as ultimately I couldn't have given a fig about any of the characters, especially not Eddie Redmaynes constantly whispering Villain. All in all, I was so disappointed with this film and I still can't believe it came from the same minds as those that made The Matrix. I made an IMDb account just so I could write this review and as time passes since I finished watching it I find myself forgetting more and more about it. So ultimately, this movie is forgettable and not worth the money I payed to rent it",Jupiter Ascending

The movie is all about fights, as far as I watched, you don't learn anything from it and it's not an entertaining movie, is boring and repetitive.I like Eddie Redmayne, Tuppence Middleton, Bae Doona and Sean Bean, but I think they were not made for this movie, for me they looked very weird.I'm from Brazil, my first language is Portuguese, I apologize for the mistakes I've made.",Jupiter Ascending

Without giving away the ending, the writers left the heroin (female) character in the same, demeaning job, even though she was given the power to change everything for herself and her family. It was as if they were saying that even if she is powerful, she is just a female and beneath everyone else. If the ending was written to reflect her as the person they made her, and she changed for the better, like she went to college, because her parents were educated college professors etc. or anything better than what she was doing in the beginning of the movie. This just continues to portray females as in capable of rising above their circumstances no matter if they are given the opportunity to change.",Jupiter Ascending

First, by Mila Kunis' shallow acting, which was out of place in contrast to engaging performances from other characters. Second, by glorifying the special effects and overshadowing the emotions, conflict, and romance...essentially, the actual story. And third, by the soundtrack. Ethan Stoller, the music composer, wrote such cheesy music for this film that it made serious actors appear like a parody. His musical themes were fragmented, failed to draw out the emotion on screen, and were at best distracting. In the hands of different directors and composers, this would have been a very different, and arguably better, film.",Jupiter Ascending

Not only is the story disjointed, the dialogue is awful, and the make up is laughable. Then there were the fake drinks in scenes- it was quite apparent there was nothing in any of the glasses that people were drinking from- who allowed this, the director? Did the editor even notice how bad it looked? Was all the editing focus on a special effect? There was plenty of bad acting to go around. Shame on everyone except the lizard monster guards- they have an excuse, they appeared to be animation of some sort. I only put this movie on because usually today's sci fi is more engaging and I am a fan of Ms.Kunis. There was nothing that saved this movie. The plot is not clever it is however old and the tone of the movie and the execution of the plot was beyond annoying. The special effects were not too bad but special effects a movie does not make. Bad plot, bad script, bad acting, that is what Jupiter Ascending is full of. Please save your time and money (thank goodness this was free for me).

It was an entertaining trip to a beautiful fantasy. I think this is another fantastic Sci-Fi movie from Wachowskis, colorful, suspenseful, interesting plot, pretty nice script, lots of action, decent acting, decorations, excellent costumes and much more... One more thing though: well elaborated smear campaign.... There are much worse garbage movies out there even nominated for Oscar, this one has been attacked unfairly, I disagree with most of the criticism, because it was entertaining to watch and made me want to watch it again",Jupiter Ascending
919,brian-21873,Perceptive Parable,7,1 February 2016,"I dropped this down to a 7 for all of the reasons that other reviewers gave it bad reviews. The character development and acting is sub-par. The casting for Jupiter Jones seems a poor decision. The action scenes get too long and lose the viewers' interests. etc.On the surface, this movie is visually stunning. The universe the Wachowskis have built is absolutely remarkable. The movie is almost worth watching just for this.However, In the end the reason I loved this movie has nothing to do with the acting, the visuals, or the casting. This story is clearly a parable that most people aren't seeing because they can't get past the aforementioned flaws. I suspect the characters were written on purpose to be 2-dimensional. The characters are not the main purpose of this story. They are caricatures and that is exactly what they are supposed to be.Spoilers below...If you are a Matrix fan, I hope you saw the similarities between the two parables. Here we have vast numbers of people enslaved in worlds that are illusions pulled over their eyes. They have no idea their world is essentially a field planted to be harvested at some future date. They are enslaved to be converted into life energy or elixir just as the humans in the Matrix were used to power the machine world.In Jupiter Ascending, Jupiter Jones takes the role of The One. She is reincarnated just as The One recurred. She was the mechanism whereby the inhabitants of earth are freed from the harvest, freed from the Matrix.At first the three heirs to the Abraxis empire and their interactions with Jupiter seem to be a confusing mess, but you come to the realization that they each represent some aspect of humanity as it relates to capitalism. The first one she encounters is clearly a self-serving woman who cares only about herself. She's willing to kill someone to extend her own life. She represents consumers. The second heir is clearly a lover a lies and a master of marketing. He could sell anything. And the third and final heir is the ultimate reality of capitalism, the puppet master, a lover of power and the man who is in control of everything - a corporate overlord.The trade in human life and the consumption, nay cannibalism, of other humans for the extension of one's own life is in the end, while absolutely disgusting, an incomparable analogy for how we treat other people in this world. Humans have become dollar signs, or sex objects, or cogs in a corporate wheel.I could go on, but I think that is enough to convey the reason I found the movie to be particularly compelling. The Wachowskis are clearly attempting to advance the telling of a story they have tried to tell before. This is a new setting and some things are more explicit whereas some things are more abstract. But this movie helped me to understand what the Wachowskis were attempting to convey in the Matrix and its successors.",Jupiter Ascending

It doesn't make a lot of sense, its confusing, and because of that a lot of people find it hilarious. To me, that's the perfect representation of this film. The only reason why i gave this 6 stars instead of the 4 it probably deserves is because it was so completely ridiculous, that I found it to be a little bit funny. Things I enjoyed: Channing Tatum being shirtless 2/3 of the movie, and the galactic-princess fashion was on point.The plot though, was shallow and uninteresting and even though it had good actors, the acting left a lot to be desired (although one must ask how good can the acting be, when working on such a bad movie). The story was the biggest issue: being as nonsensical as it was. It felt like someone's fist attempt at sci-fi after writing too many scripts targeted for middle school girls. It was a laugh though, and I didn't mind it that it was so bad since the movies are pretty cheap where I live.",Jupiter Ascending

I liked parts of it and was also horribly disappointed. It was weird. It was complicated. And I didn't care. Oh my god so beautiful and expensive with such good actors, and it could have been so much better. I think that's the real insult, is that it had so much potential and somehow failed to deliver. I really wanted to like this movie. I REALLY wanted to like it, but I can only appreciate certain elements of it. It was visually stunning and incredibly boring. I was disappointed in the outcome.

924,stangirl,What makes a good Movie? And does this movie have it?,10,28 June 2016,"I read a few reviews of Jupiter Ascending, and I was amazed that so many bad reviews existed. I actually watched the movie first. I don't remember seeing any previews or commercials for this movie, or maybe they was out of sync with what the movie was really about. While I was watching I just kept thinking 'why haven't I heard about this movie before?' It was late at night, after work, and I was just looking for a fantasy movie to watch before bed and this showed up. The title and the cover weren't all that catching, but I couldn't find anything better.Fast Forward to the end of the movie...I want more. I want sooo much more I can't stand the thought of not having a second one. All of the reviews go crazy over the fact that stuff wasn't explained here, and what does that mean there, and how does this even work. Well here's my opinion. I want a prequel for Caine! I want to see his backstory, I want to know more about what happened to him that led him to Earth to meet up with Jupiter. I want to KNOW EVERYTHING.You know what else I want, I want to see more stuff explained in a sequel. We will see more actual politics and negotiating as Jupiter takes her place in the Universe. I want to find out if she DOES do anything about the harvests. I want to know if her and Caine get married or have kids. I want to know what happens to Stinger and Titus, and Kalique. This movie is like the first book of a series. It leaves so many questions about the fictional universe that you devour the books as fast as you can to learn as much as you can. Even if Hollywood, and Rotten Tomatoes, and whoever else hates it or criticizes it for being this or that. I just want everyone who liked it and the Writers, Directors, and Actors to know that I loved it and if it were a book series, or if there were sequels, I would totally drag my whole family and friends along to see it.I already have a movie night planned where me and my friends are going to watch it together. I love the Universe, and the neat way things are explained and the interesting genetic stuff that is going on in the story.Siscal and Ebert(Spelling?) can kiss my little toushe, cause this movie ROCKED!!*This movie contains exclusive sci-fi views, opinions, and explanations.

925,RaviJ,Stunning! Ridiculous. A parody and and a work of art.,10,6 February 2015,"Jupiter Ascending Review (there are some small spoilers - nothing major):I'm in 2 minds about this film.Firstly it works in 3D, really well IMO.Visually it's the best looking film I've ever seen!Music was good, but was a rip off in places of Hans Zimmer, Bear McCreary and a few others. Still I like all their stuff, so I'm fine with it.The film is pretty enjoyable and is paced and edited pretty well.There are loads of homages to many, many films from the last 100 years.At one point I thought I was watching Brazil. Then low and behold Terry Gilliam turns up!There are bits nicked straight from Blade Runner.There is a Ray Harryhausen bit for about 3 seconds.Eddie Redmand is playing Emperor Ming / Caligula.There are bit that are nicked from Cinderella, Superman, Caligula, Terminator, Aliens, all the Star Wars films (the costumes of Cinderella, sorry Jupiter are a mickey take of Amidala in Star Wars Episode 1) Flash Gordon, James Bond (the bad guy live in the Red Spot on Jupiter, not a hollowed out volcano), Gladiator (the baddies are 1000000000 year old Roman Dynasty), Dune, Prometheus, Spiderman (the surfer), Predator, Bat Man, Tron Legacy, Fifth Element, Game of Thrones, a bit the was like ET, Close Encounters, another scene with little green men in a corn field (Signs and probably a few other Alien Abduction Movies), and probably a zillion others!It was like a cut'n'paste of every film that you like, FFS!There were quite a few in references. Mila Kunis is on the poster in the clinic, the voice of the life support. A few others I forgot.So to elaborate my 2 minds:On one hand it's the most visually stunning film I've ever seen. I'd liken it to seeing Star Wars the first time, or Avatar.On the other it was pretty derivative stuff. May be that's unfair, as they were more homages. There are some interesting concepts though.Such as in an infinite universe, mankind would have infinite resources at his disposal. So the only thing of value would be his time. And he would do anything to get more of it.The film is complete in it's ending, but I can see them doing another if it does well.It actually needs a sequel, as there are enough subplots to explore.The film is totally bonkers, yes it's a mess, but I liked it all the same!Overall - go see it!

926,hotfunkdog-68399,A new world view,9,14 November 2016,"Pretty much, this movie can be outlined by the same themes as The Matrix, except instead of being in a computer program, the people are ruled by a universal harvesting company which treats them like a crop.They're just exploring themes from various sci-fi alien books, movies, and supposed classified documents of the past and putting them all together to see what sticks. That's why I think the plot was a mess for most people, because they didn't understand the background. Also, 2001 didn't have any plot, and was totally a visual spectacle to behold for it's time. I think that's what they were aiming for. I just wish it was less... whatever style it is... social justice warrior geared, and had more grounded and dialed down costume design.The thing that turns most people off about this is the juiced up Hollywood quick to fall in love story, the over dramatized and almost effeminate bad guys, and the blatant use of themes from David Icke's version of reality. Hollywood should just cut it out with this stuff... if we want to see sexualisation, we can go to the internet. *wink wink*For a sci-fi, the attempt at exposing complex scientific theories and give a sense of reality to them, and attempting to peek at the future of humanity as a warning is in my opinion, very well done.As with the recent election results in the US, I think there's a silent majority out there that wouldn't openly tell people they like this movie... but they're out there nonetheless.(no offense to Lilly and Lana your movies are awesome regardless of your personal lives)",Jupiter Ascending

929,burnisheddusk,Large crowds of stupid less evolved homo-sapiens.,10,29 July 2018,"The negative reviewers of this movie prove a very dangerous thesis. That cognitively (I did or did not just make up that word.) challenged less-evolved humans ( Those whom are not right-brain dominant.) should NOT be allowed to write movie reviews or vote. Stupidity has a momentum all its own and can cause disasters of universal proportions.
 First of all, I am not an expert in movies. No one is. Just as there are no experts in poetry either. All anyone can do is offer informed and studied opinion and in my informed and studied opinion Jupiter Ascending is a gloriously fun and entertaining movie. Is it extraordinary? I don't feel so but since in my opinion I've only seen one that came close and that was Lawrence of Arabia. Peter O'toole is definitely in my top ten of greatest actors. 
 Sorry, I digress. After reading hundreds of negative reviews about this movie the one consistent theme throughout all of them was that the reviewers wanted specific things from the movie before actually seeing it. They kept harping about how everything was so shallow and not fleshed out. It was as if they wanted a great movie without themselves having to work at making it a great movie. An audience brings a great movie to the theatre. Your imagination should be flying even before you get to the theatre. But obviously these reviewers left their imaginations at home (If they even possess one.) because to say this movie is lacking (in my opinion) in anything is ludicrous.
 The first time I watched this film I had no knowledge of it, hence no preconceived notions. Just the title and companion graphics peeked my interest enough to watch the trailer. I watched it immediately. I was still unaware of the backstory to this film even though I saw it for the first time in fall of 2017. I was amazed, truly amazed. As of this writing I've watched it dozens of times and every time my imagination fills in just a little more of the Universe that the W's created. This movie gives you just enough in all the right ways so YOU can CREATE an incredible story.
 Just a few more things and I'll leave you to watch this wonderful movie. After you do, then come back and read these reviews again and you will see some of their ideas on the film are completely wrong. The reviewers keep screaming about plot blanks. That the characters get from one point to another with no continuity. This is patently false. Not once did I ever lose the thread of what was taking place. Of course, I have an imagination so I don't need everything explained. But that's just me...
 If you're a voracious reader like myself you tend, or always perhaps, see the novel in movie form. With great attention to detail you fill in the blanks of the scene the author is describing. With movies, especially this movie, the directors have given you the most glorious visuals and as always the dialogue is there for context. It is up to you to create this stunning world you have been given a glimpse of. I wish you could see it the way I saw it, with an utter lack of reference but please do your best. Never take an opinion on faith, even if that opinion is accepted as fact by millions. Ones opinion can be a tragedy. Millions blindly following that same opinion can be an election.10/10",Jupiter Ascending

How you could look at this and say ""yeah we've done well there"" is beyond me. The Matrix was good and V for Vendetta likewise but those apart... nothing. So Jupiter Ascending, where to begin.... pure style over substance, poor characters, terrible story arc that makes little to no sense on occasion, poor acting (Redmayne is possibly the worst culprit and his voice is just ridiculous) which is disappointing given some of the talent on offer here. Even the makeup and effects look poor. For some reason Tatum looks like a cross between Legolas and Metallica singer James Hetfield?!?

The thing is, I don't think I have ever sat through a Wachowski movie and not been completely engrossed in it after sitting down and to me Jupiter Ascending is no exception. I admit it does feel a little bit like the Matrix with a female antagonist instead of Neo. And instead of Trinity we get Channing Tatum as a soulful man/dog who kicks butt. But all of the main characters are likable, you root for them, and honestly I kind of wouldn't mind learning more about this world they created.Although they do borrow elements from other sci-fi stories, quite frankly, I am glad to give my money to an attempt at an original idea and story as opposed to another Spiderman or Superman remake.

I knew it was time to go when my wife turned to me and asked, ""What is going on?"". This came an hour into the movie.The biggest problem was the '600 page' script. With so much information to give to the audience, the majority of the film is spent spewing exposition, back-story, and details. This is done often, and regularly, usually in the worst way possible - with the characters standing, sitting, or walking while they do it. After a overly long sequence of action, it would be followed up with an OVERLY long sequence of characters doing nothing but talking and bombarding the audience with an overload of information.The script was a mess. The idea was interesting and could have worked had they not tried to pour a 600 page script into our noggins.

The concepts of immortality at the cost of lives (One of the main themes about ""In Time"" that I liked so much), universal dynasties, endless visit-able worlds, advanced technology that can rebuild cities, genetic engineering, re-incarnation and powerful people politically maneuvering; These are all concepts that on their own could make a story incredible, and this movie created a universe that contained them all. So what happened? Essentially all of the amazing things above took a backseat to the teenage romance between the heroine and the shirtless guy who rescued her every couple minutes. In fact, none of the concepts were even explored at all except for letting us know of their existence. Even the main driving force behind the plot (The harvesting of earth) was only brought up a handful of times. The harvesting of the earth and deaths of billions barely even effected the Heroine's decisions. Her family (which she purportedly disliked) on the other hand... It was also that the fight scenes didn't really contribute much to the story aside except fill time. And lastly it was because the heroine made obviously silly emotional decisions that just caused more problems. (see family vs planet above).And most of all it was that at the end, after she had seen what exists in the universe and she owns entire planets. What does she do, this ""adventurous"" girl who so badly wanted a telescope to spend time dreaming of space. When she has the opportunity to actually visit space, to make her life infinitely better, to influence the planet in countless positive ways, take her family and make their lives better.She decides to happily go back to cleaning toilets. tldr; Amazing world, so many possibilities to explore, epic set up, and even good acting. All ending in failure, made worse by what it could have been.",Jupiter Ascending

I loved the film. I'd like a hero like him in my life.",Jupiter Ascending
939,timovanwettum,Like a hidden rotten apple,4,17 April 2018,"The movie has such good grafics and could've been a great one but hollywood did it again. The scipt is just the worst, trying to make a sciencefiction / action movie more apealing for women with love, drama and uncomfortable scenes of a ordinary life of a girl. With some extra gay scenes and afro american characters this would be perfecly PC. I wich they would go back to making movies for the story rather than making them for an audience.",Jupiter Ascending
940,sage-79962,"I don't understand the poor reviews, movie was great. A watch repeatedly great.",10,20 August 2018,"I have no idea why such bad reviews but I enjoyed the movie enough to have seen it multiple times. Graphics are amazing, story line is pretty good (not perfect but I have an uncanny ability to solve movies in the first ten minutes). It is one of the rare ones I didn't know the ending of in the first minutes. Maybe that's why I like it, and others don't. The plot isn't transparent, makes you think, and is above all else....unique. A nice twist to the typical movies of this genre. If you have a good tv, and surround sound, give it a try.",Jupiter Ascending

942,jeb-68095,Great sci-fi action,8,2 October 2021,The plot isn't deep and neither are the characters. You either love or hate this kind of movie. The action scenes are great. Who wouldn't want a pair of those anti-gravity boots? They make up for the rest. Be sure you watch this on the biggest screen you can. Even Star wars looks bad on a small screen.,Jupiter Ascending
943,ryankan-45158,What could have been,2,22 July 2019,"For a film boasting Oscar winners and box office draws such as Channing Tatum and Mila Kunis, it is frankly impressive how poor the end product ended up being. A convoluted plot that masquerades as a feminist sci-fi action romp, it never really gets going and besides the fake scientific lingo, the plot is the second most confusing part of the film. Don't waste your time with it, just spin around until you see spots and it will be the same cinematic experience",Jupiter Ascending
