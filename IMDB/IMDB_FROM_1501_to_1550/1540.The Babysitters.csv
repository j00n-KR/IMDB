0,SnoopyStyle,no redeeming value,4,24 April 2016,High schooler Shirley Lyner (Katherine Waterston) babysits for Michael (John Leguizamo) and Gail Beltran (Cynthia Nixon). Shirley starts making out with Michael and then have sex. Michael lets out the secret to his friend and word spreads. Shirley recruits her eager friend Melissa Rowan. Next it's quiet Brenda. They start a business called The Babysitters. Brenda brings in her stepsister Nadine who starts her own competing service with other girls.It's salacious without any redeeming value. It treats the material with no intention of being anything better. It has neither any satire nor any tension. This is not a serious treatment of this creepy subject matter. It's basically nothing. Waterston shows some interesting shades at times in this early work but there is nothing else.,The Babysitters
1,nogodnomasters,Who else needs a sitter?,4,27 April 2018,"After sitting, Shirley gets paid $200 for the ride home. It isn't the destiny, but the journey. One by one her friends join her in providing sitting services fro the married men of the community, a risky business sitter's club. As always things get too big and too emotional or else there wouldn't be any conflict and all we would have to watch is teen girls having sex. The film looks like it would be soft porn, but it is not. There is one nude scene with Katherine Waterston that is the extension of the DVD cover. The sex was watered down also. The drama of teen girls was on the boring side. This was clearly a missed opportunity. There was a theme of everything and everyone in their place, and when one thing gets out of place it causes a domino effect.They should have gone back to it. Or a clip of a ketchup bottle placed wrong.",The Babysitters
2,lee_eisenberg,sometimes it's best to stick with your original intention,7,25 December 2008,"""The Babysitters"" seems like the sort of movie that could debut the Sundance Film Festival. It focuses on an anal-retentive teenage girl (Katharine Waterston, Sam's daughter) who turns her babysitting service into a prostitution business, only to have things take an unexpected turn. If the movie has any problem, it's that much of it's a little hard to follow. Seriously, it seems like the movie lets things go on for a while before clarifying the purpose. Then again, they might need time to let things develop.Overall, I'd say that the movie is worth seeing, although you certainly have to have a long attention span. Also starring John Leguizamo and Cynthia Nixon (of ""Sex and the City"").",The Babysitters
3,paul_haakonsen,"Entertaining, sure, but nothing out of the ordinary...",5,23 August 2013,"The sole reason for why I picked up ""The Babysitters"" was because of John Leguizamo being in it. Having read the synopsis for the movie, and that wasn't particularly a selling point for me. So, for me, the movie was depending on John Leguizamo to carry it - and so he did.The story in ""The Babysitters"" is about a young girl who babysits for a family, and whilst driving her home in the evening, the dad invites her in to a diner for something to eat. Here they come to talk and a spark is set off between them. The dad ends up having sex with the babysitter. Eventually his friend finds out and wants in on the deal, and the babysitter bring in her friends to help servicing these adult men who have wives and kids. And business is good for the 'babysitters'.Storywise, then ""The Babysitters"" doesn't really blow you away - pardon the pun. The story is good enough in itself, although it does deal with a taboo subject, so the movie may not be suitable for just anyone.What made the movie watchable was the acting in the movie, because people really did great jobs with their given roles and characters. And also the characters in the movie were really fleshed out nicely and in great detail.""The Babysitters"" is a story- and character-driven movie, so don't expect the movie to get up into a fast pace at any given moment.If you enjoy dramas that deal with issues that are not common day events - controversial events you might say - then ""The Babysitters"" might be just the right movie for you.",The Babysitters
4,lastliberal,"The money is nice, and paid fellatio isn't that much more humiliating than flipping burgers.",6,14 March 2009,"OK, there is something slightly sleazy about watching a movie featuring high school girls making money providing sex to dads.Michael (John Leguizamo) and his wife (Cynthia Nixon) are falling into routine, and she is not interested in his hobby. His job is becoming a bore. He and the babysitter (Katherine Waterston) fall into an illicit relationship.Soon, Shirly (Waterston) gets her friends into babysitting for $200 a pop and takes a cut.One of the girls (Louisa Krause) wants out and things go to hell.Waterston was really good, and I always enjoy Leguizamo in anything he does.",The Babysitters
5,siderite,"A rather good idea with great start, but a bit of a simple ending",8,6 September 2008,"I marked it high because of the original script idea and the great acting, but I have to say that the ending could have been better.It is an audacious concept: babysitting teenagers are acting as high pay prostitutes for the fathers that drive them home. I felt that the high school teens were much too eager to have sex with strangers and that the wives were terrible if they didn't smell anything suspicious. In the end it all comes down, as it would be expected, but it unravels the complex feelings underneath in the process. The girls are all beautiful, Katherine Waterson plays great; John Leguizamo again brings great quality to a movie; the direction is really good. While the film has a great story to tell, I felt that the script was a bit naive.Bottom line: it is a tensioned, raw even, autopsy of the real suburb feelings: the taken for granted wives, the ignored teenagers and the powerful urges of the overworked middle aged men, overlooked by their spouses.",The Babysitters
6,kairingler,babysitting ?,9,11 July 2013,"I really enjoyed this movie, first off John Leguizomo gives a terrific performance in his role.. the movie deals with a bunch of sexy teenage girls perhaps bored and broke,, they offer ""babysitting"" services as a ruse for prostitution, with one of the girls dad's and all of his friends. there is definitely a lot of sex in this movie obviously and we assume that most if not all of the girls are underage, so that's presents a moral and legal dilemma for the men involved. not really for the girls because they just want the money, the one dad even brags to his friends that he ""did"" this girl and recommends her to all his friends. the girls on the other hand team up to make a lot of cash,, well one or more of the girls decides to get greedy and set up ""dates"" unbeknownst to the others , and when the other girls find out the catfight is on.. will the men be caught and sent to jail for exploiting these teen girls,, or will the girls blackmail the dad's and get away with it,, lot's of tension and drama,, all the way till the final climax.. no pun intended.",The Babysitters
7,aharmas,Taking control isn't that easy,8,11 May 2008,"Whoever said that brains and beauty is not an explosive combination? An enterprising young woman sees a way to take control of her life and becomes a mastermind behind a society of young women whose lives are slowly shattered when they decide to use their charms to make some money.The film starts out slowly and then hits a few highs along the way, giving us a share of strong, controversial and provocative moments. As we see the story unfold, we are not quite sure when the dangerous and tragic moments are coming. They are expected, but they are not quite as obvious as one expects. Little by little, we see the girls lose control of their enterprise, as each person's agenda begins to threatens the good of the group. Personalities begin clashing as the quiet and demure realizes she doesn't have enough strength to continue. In the opposite end, her sister is taking more and more dangerous assignments, and all of this emotional turmoil begins to prove too much for the head of the club.In the end, things work out but not that smoothly, and not without a couple of gigantic crises along the way. It is shocking at times, and there are a couple of lulls along the way that almost derail the film, but it is a movie that shows a side of teens that has probably never been shown before. It will make you think.",The Babysitters
8,TheTruthofItIs,"Yeh, it's a Lifetime Movie",5,22 April 2020,"Yeh, not much there, it's a guilty-pleasure that you'd typically find on Lifetime or Oxygen though with just the slightest ""R"" material, so maybe old-style Cinemax. Story is predictable and something you've seen a dozen times already but played out by oh-so-anxious high school teens, and they're not even all that hot, ugh.",The Babysitters
9,DuskShadow,The accuracy was fairly astounding.,6,13 December 2018,"I knew pimps and hoes that started getting into the ""game"" at young ages. They would extol what they did as the greatest thing ever, nothing being better. They would be famous and popular throughout the years growing up, and though I never ""used the services"" of either pimps or hoes at any point in my life, I still knew a few of the most infamous of my generation "" at least in my neck of the woods, which is a giraffe worth of woods to neck through, I suppose... Seeing this from the perspective of an actress portraying a female pimp in high school reminded me of some of the people I have heard of and met throughout my life. From the lingering doubt draining away as promises of more money come more often to the dangers involved from the law or simply the perceptions of others around, this seemed fairly realistic. From the angst and trepidation of would be participants on all sides, to the raw primal emotion of either release much sought after, whether achieved or not, to ""protecting ones turf"", this was done in a strange way for a suburban backdrop versus a more classic ""inner city"" pimp flick of the 70s. IT was different, and as far as moral dilemmas go that may have happened in the past or be happening now, it gives a look at two of the oldest ""gigs"" in the world: The pimp and the hoe.
THe music was good, John Leguizamo was a shocker to see in such a film, but in a way this was just really gritty if one thinks about the extents some go to make a buck, or seek what they believe they need to give them happiness or fulfillment. Strange Tale.",The Babysitters
10,RockPortReview,Could this be happening at your High School?,7,4 April 2012,"""The Babysitters"" could be classified as a Lifetime style movie mixed with a big handful of Cinemax sleaze, but is it ever fun to watch. It's quite the guilty pleasure, but also a disturbing view of seedy suburban life.First time writer/director David Ross creates a world where seemingly every man is a depraved, sex obsessed creep. One such man (the most ""normal"") is Michael played by John Leguizamo who is going through the proverbial mid-life crisis. Married with two young boys he begins and illicit affair with the babysitter, Shirley played by Katherine Waterston. She is a tall brunette who is smart, beautiful and has good business sense. When Michael tells his friends about Shirley's ""services"" they want her to babysit for them to. So she gets a few of her hot friends to help out and all of a sudden she is running a prostitution ring and getting a 20 percent cut.She tells us in the beginning that she is a regular girl from a non dysfunctional family and has never been abused or anything. She just likes the money and giving head isn't any more humiliating than flipping burgers. There is no morality in this film and the main characters realize this as Shirley mentions to Michael that they're both going to hell for this. The most outright uncomfortable and disturbing scenes take place in cabin when all the middle aged married guys get together with all the under age babysitter prostitutes. Everybody has taken ecstasy, and bad things start to happen. During a bathroom scene we shocked back to reality as to what these people are doing. This is really the only point where we see any consequences from this whole ordeal.So if you happen to find yourself bored one night, grab a few beers, a bag of chips, lock the door and watch ""The Babysitters"".",The Babysitters
11,vintagegeek,Pleasantly Surprised,8,6 June 2018,"Although a predictable storyline, the characters were more engaging then a typical movie of this genre.",The Babysitters
12,pcampionz,Actually a surprise,8,17 May 2021,"I was thoroughly surprised. I thought it was going to be a T and A type flick, but there was actually hardly any nudity. Different spin but the young actresses were all pretty good and believable in their roles. Legazamo was great as he always is and it looks like he produced it. Was not a waste of time!",The Babysitters
13,jafar-iqbal,"Boring, predictable, and full of uninspired performances",4,19 November 2013,"After she ends up having sex with one of her customers, a teenager decides to turn her babysitting job into an illicit escort agency, with herself and her friends as the call-girls. Things are great at first, but the reality of the situation she has put herself and her friends in starts to take its toll.I'll be honest – even before I started to watch 'The Babysitters', I wasn't feeling great about it. A decent cast of good but unimpressive actors; a handful of sexy girls there to just be sexy; and a play on that lovely babysitter fantasy. It was destined to be failure.And, well, it's a failure.It's a failure mainly because it's so predictable. It was clear to see where it was going, and writer/director David Ross never really challenges our expectations – if anything, he goes out of his way to make sure everything goes as we imagined it would. Very boring.Another problem is that Katherine Waterston (playing central character Shirley), as gorgeous as she is, just isn't a very good actor. If you're going to base your film around a young actor, that actor better be good, and we didn't get that here. She's not absolutely awful, she has her moments, but nothing sustained enough to make it a performance worth investing in. The big name in the film is John Leguizamo. I liked his character, and the man is obviously a fantastic actor, but he's wasted here. Similarly, Cynthia Nixon is barely there, and doesn't have a lot to do.I feel I should balance this out with a positive from the movie, but I'm at a loss as to what that might be. If I would praise anything, it would be the performance of Lauren Birkell, as Shirley's best friend Melissa. She is the kooky, quirky one, and does it very well. It's a spirited performance, the kind of performance someone gives when they're doing best to get noticed. But it's one shining light in a badly-made film.'The Babysitters' is watchable, but you're not going to enjoy it too much. If you're happy to put up with a boring script if it means you get some lovely eye candy, please do watch this, as you get a healthy dose of both things. If you like your films, y'know, good, avoid it.",The Babysitters
14,vanmust,Bitter sweet with only one shade of Grey,9,13 August 2017,"I had that movie uploaded along with some others ...due to summer fires we had a 4 hour blackout...luckily my laptop was fully charged so I watched it on the porch ...I did like it....the story is fairly common and most of the characters ordinary ...that is strangely it,s success...you can very easily recall similar situations that happened either to you or to people very close...most of the characters display some weaknesses here and there but the two protagonists top the list .It is so tragic to see Michael sacrifysing his infatuation for his family as well as Shirley acting tough while she hurts inside...I cannot say I knew miss Waterston but checking wiki I was surprised to see that by the time of the films release she already was pushing 27...she really looked much younger...if that was unintentional or she put an effort to it it works very positive for her...Conclusion...I liked it a lot and left me with a sad feeling....of how many times life plays us like dominoes",The Babysitters
15,oolatech2,Girl is the other woman capitalism takes over and life bites you in the bum.,8,10 August 2010,"The babysitters is far from a dark comedy, but I must agree it was an excellent film. I thought the majority of the sex scenes were filmed in good taste. I think the actresses showed a very cold nature, but considering they were selling themselves to get into college I felt it worked well. The film left me wondering how gritty this movie ended up being. I really enjoyed the transformation of Shirley into the boss of the girls in her ""club"". She is heavy handed and shows how money and secrets turn a normal girl with ODD into a capitalistic madame with a strong right arm. I agree that it showed men as shallow and selfish, but the girls were profiting which I think made sense. I didn't find it a 10 because of the picture it painted and the disturbing ending. I think Shirley got her just deserve and the only one I felt sorry for was the innocent ""step brother"". If you like gritty with titty this is for you. If you want something funny and sweet do not take a seat!!!!",The Babysitters
16,bill-987,A lot more than I expected!,8,15 April 2009,"I enjoy films which present the viewer with multiple threads to consider and this is certainly one of those. 1. All Men Are Pigs – Every male character in the film is portrayed in the least flattering light possible. John Leguizamo's character, arguably the most understandable, if not likable, is an indifferent father who floats along in his marriage and his affair choosing paths of least resistance every time. Even Brenda's teen brother Scott, who starts out as a shy and endearing character quickly becomes a judgmental little creep. 2. To Cheat or Not To Cheat – Michael and Gail Beltran do a poor job in addressing the problems in their marriage. Michael seems to be the partner who makes the attempt to confront their issues but it's a halfhearted attempt at best and is easily swept aside by Gail running off to an unscheduled NA meeting. No wonder when Michael strays! 3.Women Are Greedy and Backstabbing – Nadine certainly is but she's the primary one with this foible and she already seemed to present as a pampered spoiled bitch anyway! Hardly deserving of elevation to a central theme in the film! 4. If they're Old Enough To Die For their Country – How old is old enough? To me, this is the central theme of the film. Justice vs. the Rule of Law. Our society has established an often arbitrary and almost always capricious series of numerical boundaries to substitute for common sense and fairness under our law-based system. Its okay to enlist and die for one's country at 17 but you can't have a legal drink at 20. Practically every county had its own BAC limit until the federal statute was forced down everyone's throats mandating the .080 limit. It's illegal to photograph the bare buttocks of a 17-year-old but a flesh colored thong is okay on a 10-year-old. We've executed teens at 16, 17, and 18, but whether you were eligible for the death penalty depended on where you committed your crime. You can hire an 18-year-old to shoot a porn movie in your garage but pick up a 17-year-old in a bar drinking on an illegal ID and you go to prison. While I disagree with Shirley about the similarities between paid fellatio and burger flipping, I find I am loathe to condemn her efforts at earning extra college money if I am forced to use as my only basis for condemnation the potential legal consequences for her clients. 5. Don't Do Drugs - Hmmm Maybe this is an anti-drug movie since they're portrayed as being at the root of the Beltran's marital problems as well as a primary precipitant in Brenda's breakdown and the decline and fall of the babysitters company.Definitely worth a nod, I give it a solid '8' almost a '9'! I do know that I'm already looking forward to Ms. Waterston's next effort.",The Babysitters
17,tomasdiaz,The Babysitters is original,10,9 August 2008,The Babysitters is a completely original film. What a great plot. It doesn't hurt that John Leguizamo is in this one. He's an actor that can carry a film. I though the story was hip with a dark undercurrent. A teenager turns madam after her babysitting service gets sexy. The sex was secondary to the plot. At the core it was a drama about the human condition of getting older. At one time you're in high school then you find yourself married with children looking back and wanting back those youthful days of freedom. I highly recommend The Babysitters to add to your DVD collection. Writer and Director David Ross delivers an outstanding film. One of the best I've watched recently.,The Babysitters
18,beornmatt,"Great idea, poor execution",4,13 April 2015,"I can imagine some director sitting down and going ""Hmm. I've got a great movie idea. Check this out: a high school girl recruits her friends to be call girls under the auspices of babysitting and turns into a ruthless pimp."" Good idea for an edgy movie, right? Probably so, but the execution was pretty bad here. There were so many holes in logic and obvious plot devices that it made it very difficult for me to willingly suspend my disbelief. For instance: What high school doesn't have security cameras in it? How many 16- year-olds are willing to sleep with 40 year old men in one high school? What high school keeps all sorts of paint and such around for kids to just grab? What man with a wife and two kids keeps three hundred bucks of totally disposable income in his wallet three to four nights per week? How dumb are these wives to not pick up on any of this? Kids break into a school and the cops don't come, but John Leguizamo stands near a train track and his wife freaks out that he might get arrested? How does a girl with OCD decide it's a good idea to destroy a school? For that matter, how does that same girl use the vandalism of the school to threaten her wayward hookers? ""I threw paint on your lockers. Don't f*** anyone without my permission or next time it won't be paint."" ""Well, you smashed in the trophy case. That'll teach me to keep my legs closed."" And on and on.The idea was a pretty good one. This movie had a lot of potential in it for something gritty, chilling, and dark. As a finished product, however, it seemed to just be some indie schlock that was trying for profundity and wound up falling face-first into some dad's lap.",The Babysitters
19,Aregie,"Yippee, more teenage boobs.",2,3 January 2010,"I am incredulous at the positive reviews for this movie. The only positive thing I can say about the film is the strong performance by the lead actress.The film was billed as a dark comedy on my local cable channel. It was dark, yes, but it was a stretch to find anything to laugh about with teen girls being exploited by not only their father's peers, but by each other.For me, it could have succeeded as a study of serious moral dilemma, but the characters were far too superficial and there was little insight provided into their behavior.The Babysitters is an excuse to watch braless teens bounce across the screen, nothing more. And sadly, I'm afraid this probably many people's cup of tea.",The Babysitters

21,uncre8tv,Great little indy film,8,5 August 2008,"This is what I look for in independent film. Well drawn characters, competent movie making, and a pleasing ambiguity that a big studio wouldn't dare leave in, lest the audience actually decide how to feel for themselves. The guys are great - desperate, sleazy, charming, funny and sad. The girls are also portrayed fairly - scheming, sweet, sexy and innocent. Leguizamo's character is believable to me as an aging playa, chafing against middle age and lusting for Waterson's Shirley. And Shirley is the best on-screen pimp in recent memory. To be fair: things unfold a little quickly, people accept their situations a little easier than they might in real life, but this is a pretty short movie, and throwing in more angst would be overkill and overlong on screen. No one comes away clean, and no one comes away as the absolute bad guy. Moral absolutes would kill this film, and I'm glad it got made the way it did.",The Babysitters
22,lawhite3,Eeeew and yuck.,1,27 December 2011,"The ONLY reason I watched this was to see John Leguizamo. But as an uptight, suburban white guy? No. Didn't make the cut for me. How Lauren Birkell's character went from OCD to PIMP was really ridiculous. Then she goes from nerd to violent street thug? This was a infomercial for pedophiles. Only Cynthia Nixon's uptight suburban character was plausible because she played the same role in Sex in the City. I would have been happier if Chris Hansen had a cameo role and some of the men had been caught up in a To Catch a Predator Dateline program! This was a gross film about gross people doing gross things. I'll just keep thinking of John Leguizamo as Benny Blanco; it will make this character go away and I'll feel better. . .",The Babysitters
23,sexybeastv6,"Very good, yet odd.",6,6 August 2013,"I loved the characters though I did wish that the movie didn't end so fast, I would have loved to see someone's wife find out. There are a lot of interesting and sleazy events taking place in this film and oddly enough you'll find yourself glued to the seat begging for more craziness to happen as the story line unfolds. This film is dramatically insane with hot romances and yet its a little disturbing once you factor in the age and lives that they lead. These girls are not your typical high school students, don't expect anything but slightly tamed adult material from this flick. This movie in my opinion is a must see, and most definitely not for people with an open mind.",The Babysitters
24,melot7,"Powerful, Arousing, and Cries Out What IF?",7,5 September 2013,"This movie was entertaining and at times, arousing. The characters are well-written and develop on their own as the movie progresses. Certain scenes make a lasting impression in one's mind, especially when one of the teens experiences what can only be described as borderline rape when she suddenly pauses and cries out twice for her mom. This, to me, was one of the most powerful scenes in the movie. The only issue I have with this movie was the pairing up of John Leguizamo and Cynthia Nixon as a married couple. Individually, they play their parts quite well, however, they do not have much on-screen chemistry. And maybe I grew up in a different time, however, some of the teens' actions seem unbelievable. There perhaps should have been more contemplation or hesitation, even for a teen. Especially when some of these older men are not attractive, at all. Yet, this movie certainly and successfully does make one think, what if? I would recommend watching this movie, definitely worth your time.",The Babysitters
25,theofficialmaxine,So much more than I expected,10,31 August 2008,"Stuck at home and recovering from a viral throat infection, I was looking for a couple of nice little cheesy movies that didn't take much brain power. What I found instead, was one utter piece of dross (Black Ribbon, don't bother watching it), and this absolute gem. Not at all the Debbie-does-Dallas style piece of cheese that I was expecting from the description I had read, I found this film really rather touching and thought provoking. The acting was excellent, especially considering the apparent young age of some of the cast. Katherine Waterston shone as Shirley, and managed to convey all of the awkwardness of her slightly neurotic teenage character, whilst still being completely convincing in later scenes where her inner core of steel shows through. The range of different personalities amongst the girls as a group was excellent, and each character was thoroughly fleshed out. If there was a weak link here, I would say that perhaps there was not quite enough focus on the reactions of the teenage boys to what is going on around them - Scott's reaction to Shirley later in the film appears to come from nowhere. Perhaps a deleted scene? The sex, whilst somewhat explicit, was never gratuitous, and there were a couple of uncomfortable scenes that had me on the edge of my seat. Whilst I certainly never got involved in anything like this as a teenager, I found I was reminded very strongly of the amoral thing I once was, and rather grateful, in fact, that I was never given the choice that these girls are offered in the film. The lack of any real analysis of their actions only serves to make these teens more convincing in my view - what teenager really considers the consequences of their actions before taking them? My recommendation: Get hold of a copy of this film, grab yourself some popcorn, and watch it through, and be prepared for some introspection afterwards.",The Babysitters
26,Bethanybee33,Pedophile's fantasy,1,10 November 2021,"I have a hard time believing any normal person actually likes this movie. Not only are the girls in high school and are literally being exploited and groomed by creepy men their fathers ages, but the main character Shirley completely changes her personality it's not even enjoyable to a normal person. First shirleys shy and all OCD and then changes to this mean greedy pimp character. But to actually like watching this type of movie, you must like seeing the sexualization of teens. I felt uneasy the whole movie and there was no justice at the end. The creepy men should've gotten caught and arrested and their wives should've found out. Like at least make the guys attractive so it's actually realistic and believable.Think the grossest thing about this movie is knowing it was probably made to entertain creepy men who like teens. Considering I saw a review someone wrote that said he wished Shirley and Michael would've gotten together in the end because Shirley would've liked that. Like ummm what?? Why would she like that?? She's 17 and he's her dads age. He groomed her. How is that romantic?? Bleh.",The Babysitters
27,cha_fuentes,i love the movie.,10,8 September 2008,"I saw a DVD of this movie last night, but I didn't buy it. I looked it up on the net when I got home and when I read the story's summary; I couldn't get it out of my head. I had to watch it, one way or another.Fortunately, I found a way to watch it, and what I saw was more than what I expected. This is the exactly the type of movie that I like. I immediately added it to my favorite list.It's a bittersweet movie that left me with a heavy aftertaste. Despite it's flaws, I think it's perfect. Everything fits together and though everything doesn't end well, it does justice. I'm torn about Shirley and Michael's relationship though. I wish they could have ended up together, it's be a happy ending for Shirley but it wouldn't be for Michael's family. Oh well. I guess Adult-Teen romance will seldom find a happy ending.I give the movie 2 thumbs up.",The Babysitters
28,jacknalen,A Light-Hearted Romantic Comedy,10,12 January 2010,"This is a light-hearted comedy about a teen girl who possess the drive and ambition to turn her baby sitting service into sexual smörgåsbord of under-age delights. Shirley (Katherine Waterston) the head of the babysitters acts as the fun loving pimp who makes her friends and their little sister available to babysit to families in the area. After a night of watching the little tykes the girls will be driven home by the fathers, then perform sexual acts with the middle aged men. Not only do these girls gain helpful business experience and make serious coin, but they also help raise the morale of the husbands and fathers with cash to spare.The most moving and romantic sequence in this movie is the scene at the cabin in the bathroom. Brenda (Louisa Krause) is high off her bottom on ecstasy and almost gets taken advantage of. LAWLS! but then she says ""mom"" twice which makes her abuser grow a big rubbery one. The final scene in which Shirley finds her Dad with his pants down with a sixteen year old was the perfect wrap up to this heartfelt story of love.I can surely say with confidence that this timeless classic will go down as one of the best family-oriented pictures of the century. I highly recommend this to children and rapists alike.",The Babysitters
29,gentrypemberton,Misguided & Confused,5,20 April 2012,"This movie is both entertaining and highly unsatisfying; as unsure of itself as the teenage girls it depicts. There does not seem to be an overall direction and there is little in terms of a climax. No pun intended, because the frequent sex scenes are among the film's most entertaining sequences.Almost every act committed by those in the film is immoral, illegal, or a terrible mixture of the two. Grown adults, ranging from lonely elderly perverts to unhappily married businessmen, purchase time with teenage girls running a prostitution ring disguised as a babysitting business. The film attempts to focus on the internal struggle of both the men and girls involved, but does little to form any kind of moral compass along the way. As the movie progresses, you grow to dislike the greedy ringleader as well as the married men her clique sleeps with.Due to the lack of a leading protagonist, we are left with no one to cheer for. The only thing to look forward to is some kind of justice, some kind of reprehension or punishment for the acts committed. That does not happen. The ending is, to say the least, highly disappointing and resolves no questions nor concludes the movie properly.This is the kind of film that demands a satisfying ending, but in the end, the viewer is left with more questions than answers. As far as we know, everyone involved manages to forget about the ordeal and move on. Perhaps the viewer should do the same with this film.",The Babysitters
