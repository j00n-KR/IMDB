0,Leofwine_draca,Does the job,7,8 October 2020,"I tend to avoid modern Hollywood comedy like the plague, as it's usually crude, repetitive and mindless. However, I'm a fan of Dave Bautista and I absolutely love Iko Uwais and have seen all his films, which led me to checking this out. STUBER turns out to be a pretty effective buddy comedy, although it's very short on action and unfortunately Iko only appears at the beginning and end of the movie and never gets to shine. However, the comedy works surprisingly well and focuses on witty pop culture references rather than simple inanity, and Bautista is a reliably likeable presence. Not a film that will blow you away, but it does the job, much like an experienced Uber driver.",Stuber
1,SnoopyStyle,the pairing grew on me,6,13 November 2019,"Police detective Vic Manning (Dave Bautista) is obsessed with criminal Oka Tedjo who killed his partner. His boss Angie McHenry (Mira Sorvino) tells him to spend time with his daughter Nicole (Natalie Morales). Stu (Kumail Nanjiani) is a sad sack, obsessed with friend Becca (Betty Gilpin), and stuck in a dead-end job. Vic is having trouble with his vision and hires Uber driver Stu on a dangerous pursuit of the villain Tedjo.The pairing starts off a little wonky. The premise is also a little wonky. It doesn't make sense that Stu wouldn't simply call the cops or not drive. Over time, the pairing does grow on me. They have some chemistry and Kumail gets more comedic rather than simply being a pathetic whiner. It's a basic odd couple duo on a road-trip police investigation. It's trying to be 48 Hrs but it's not at that level.",Stuber
2,Prismark10,Stuber,3,24 October 2019,"Disney were probably wandering what they purchased when they got 20th Century Fox after seeing Stuber. Well They actually got the film rights to X Men and The Fantastic Four. As well as the right to remake Home Alone movies. Nothing more valuable than that it seems.Stuber is the old standard, the mismatched buddy cop drama. Not a very good one with a film studio running on fumes as it's owner heads out of the exit door.Stu (Kumail Nanjiani) is a part time Uber driver who is bullied by his boss at a retail warehouse.Vic (Dave Bautista) is a macho cop who lost his partner a few months earlier when they were pursuing a criminal.On the day when Vic has has laser eye surgery he gets a chance to go after Oka Tedjo (Iko Uwais) the man who killed his cop partner.As Vic cannot drive he ropes in Uber driver Stu in his pursuit. Stu Is in a rush to comfort his female friend and business partner who has just broken up with her boyfriend. Stu always had a thing for her.As an action comedy, I have seen it all before when it was funnier and better in other movies. It has shades of Collateral, Ride Along, Midnight Run and 48 hours.",Stuber
3,nogodnomasters,"Heroin is bad, okay.",8,28 July 2019,"Vic (Dave Bautista) is a divorced cop out to avenge the death of his partner (Karen Gillan). Oka Tedjo (Iko Uwais) is a major heroin dealer in addition to being a cop killer. And of course, Vic has a daughter (Natalie Morales). What separates this film from the other cop-comedy films is Stu (Kumail Nanjiani) our semi-pathetic uber driver and sports store worker. Stu drives an electric lease and is in love with Becca (Betty Gilpin) who uses him for break-up sex. Vic decides to have Lasik to correct his vision problem, the same day everything goes down.I found the film very entertaining with numerous times laughing out loud.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.",Stuber
4,grantss,Generally mediocre but has its moments,5,15 April 2020,"Vic Manning is an LAPD detective trying to catch the criminal who murdered his partner. He gets a tip-off to the whereabouts of the perpetrator but has to take an Uber to get there. This makes the Uber driver, Stu, part of the action. Stu, on the other hand, is more concerned with preserving his Uber rating.Billed as a comedy-drama, Stuber doesn't really work as either. The comedy is a bit hit-and-miss, and more miss than hit. The drama has a pretty basic plot, involving the cop and the Uber driver haring around town after bad guys and getting involved in the occasional shoot out or punch up.Add in the fact that David Bautista really should not do anything involving dialogue - half the words he utters are incomprehensible - and you have the makings of a pretty bland movie.It's not all bad though. There are some genuinely funny moments and some great action scenes. It is there where the movie comes closest to working, as the action scenes are very well done and David Bautista gets to demonstrate why he is in the movie. Maybe if the writer and director had concentrated more on making this an action-drama and less a comedy it would have actually been pretty good.",Stuber
5,view_and_review,Macho Man and the Pansy,5,24 July 2019,"Stu (Kumail Nanjiani) is a chatty, insecure, in-love, part-time Uber driver. Vic (Dave Bautista) is an uber-macho, insensitive cop that has eye problems and problems being a good father. The two collide when Vic needs an Uber to take him to various places throughout L.A. to follow his leads on a big drug buy. This was supposed to be a hilarious journey of two opposites except it wasn't. Ride Along anyone?To begin with, Kumail was not funny to me. Truthfully, he never has been funny in the few things I've seen him in. But, I thought that with a leading role he could probably shine as opposed to the bit roles he's had.Nope.His nonstop rambling in hopes to stumble upon a funny line wasn't working for me. I thought he and Bautista would play off of each other a lot better but Bautista fell flat.Bautista was as stiff in his role as he looks. His movements and his delivery were like he bench pressed too many times. Like Kumail, he stumbled on a funny line or two but he was mostly a statue that happened to move. He is so much better playing Drax in Guardians of the Galaxy--a few lines, an odd speaking pattern, and there as the muscle.Along with the awkwardly unfunny pair I didn't care for the character story of either of them. Kumail was a smitten man too afraid to confess his feelings but he was sensitive and cared about others. Vic was the cliché cop that cares more about the job than anything else hence he neglects his own daughter, but he was brave.The absent neglectful father trope is so played out. Can Hollywood please do something else? Inevitably, there was already a strain between Vic and his daughter Nicole (Natalie Morales) that would only worsen due to his singular focus on his job and his machismo. He's the dad that can't remember the things that are important to his daughter, how original.Vic and Stu would have to teach each other something before the movie is over to make them better men. Vic would have to shed some of his ""toxic masculinity"" and Stu would have to ""grow some balls."" The world has no place for a macho macho man or a pansy.I had no place for either of them in any state. They were not funny and the story was not compelling. The few chuckle-worthy things didn't justify 90+ minutes of my attention. But, judging by the theater audience I was alone in my misery.",Stuber
6,neil-476,Amiable and amusing,8,19 July 2019,"Stu is an Uber driver who finds himself unwillingly pressed into service driving for Vic, an enormous and aggressive cop who is hot on the trail of the vicious psycho who killed his partner some years earlier. This would be bad enough if Vic could see. But, following a procedure on his eyes earlier in the day, Vic is more or less blind as a bat.On the basis of very little exposure to him, I have discovered that I really like Kunail Nanjiani (Stu) and I already liked Dave Bautista, here branching out into broad comedy (like Drax isn't!). These two play well off each other, and have good chemistry in a comedy which works well.You're not coming out of it feeling that you've never seen a funnier film, but you may well chuckle all the way through. I did.",Stuber
7,ferguson-6,over-squint,6,11 July 2019,"Greetings again from the darkness. A wild and over-the-top chase-fight-shootout at the Staples Center is the action-packed opening sequence, leading us to believe we are about to spend 90 minutes watching a mountain-sized rogue-cop out for vengeance. And then, as soon as that He-Man cop squeezes into the front seat of an electric car Uber, everything changes. The seismic shift in tone transitions our movie into a throwback to the 1980's buddy action-comedies, only with a few contemporary twists. Whether that's an improvement will depend on your preferences.As intense as that opening sequence is, we can't help but chuckle as we see Dave Bautista and Karen Gillan, co-stars of GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY, reuniting on screen as police partners Vic Manning and Sara Morris. Their attempts to apprehend drug dealer Teijo (Iko Uwais, THE RAID: REDEMPTION) goes horribly wrong and sets Vic on his mission to track down Teijo as he strives to avenge the death of his partner. It's this personal vendetta that has Vic prioritizing the job and his need for revenge over his relationship with his daughter Nicole (Nathalie Morales, BATTLE OF THE SEXES).Vic inadvertently schedules his LASIK surgery on the same day as Nicole's gallery showcase of her sculptures, and this decision leads to his being crunched up in the front seat of Stu's UBER (""Stuber"", get it?). Kumail Nanjani (THE BIG SICK) stars as Stu, the timid, peace-loving guy who also has a lousy job at a retail sporting goods store, and makes bad financial decisions based on his WHEN HARRY MET SALLY situation with Becca (Betty Gilpin). Stuck in the friendzone, Stu's unrequited love has him in the role of good guy to call whenever Becca gets dumped or needs money.Director Michael Dowse and writer Tripper Clancy turn the film into a road trip around the L.A. area, with each new destination punctuated with another comedic exchange between the intimidating Vic and the 'I just wanna be with Becca' Stu. In supporting roles, we get Mira Sorvino as Vic's police Captain McHenry, and Jimmy Tatro as Stu's entitled and clueless store manager Richie.Other than the frenetic opening sequence, most of the action scenes play second fiddle to the comedic interactions between opposites Vic and Stu. Unlike FREE FIRE where the comedy and action complemented each other, this film oddly allows some of the violent moments to double as punchlines ... these end up failing as both action and comedy. The film is certainly at its best when Vic and Stu are riffing off of each other, especially in the cozy front seat. The eyesight gag is overplayed and gets old pretty fast, but Kumail again proves he's a master of deadpan one-liners. The hulking Bautista more than holds his own (despite the incessant squinting), and the film touches on today's man vs the traditional idea of a man's man. It's a bit of a throwback to such buddy films as 48 HOURS, MIDNIGHT RUN, and TANGO & CASH, but it also provides a contemporary take on rogue cops, romance and masculinity. It's no LETHAL WEAPON, but the banter between Kumail and Bautista provide quite a few entertaining moments.",Stuber
8,deloudelouvain,"It depends on what kind of humor you like but I loved it, very entertaining.",8,13 January 2020,"This is the typical kind of movie that will divide a lot of people, it just depends on what kind of things that make you laugh. Not everybody has the same sense of humor so we will never agree completely about Stuber. Personally, in this genre (action/comedy), it's been a while since I've watched a good entertaining movie with some good laughs. Kumail Nanjiani is an actor I appreciate a lot in the comedy genre. He's funny and coupling him with Bautista was a good move, the nerd and the brute on a journey together just worked perfectly. The story line was also entertaining, in this genre you can't expect heavy stories, just some fun and action. I'll definitely watch this one again in the future.",Stuber
9,thesar-2,Uber Familiar and Yet,8,26 January 2020,"I am Stuber glad I actually do have 5/5 stars from Uber even though I am, for now, giving this feature-length advertisement 4/5.Admittedly, I am a fan of these kinds of movies. Yes, clichéd, predictable and dating back to the late 80s/all-90s. But, if it's something you like (like Godzilla movies, despite...,) you like it and I wasn't let down here. Helps, I ALSO watched this for both the gorgeous villain and hero.No. Not Drax. I'm talking The Big Sick. Oh, and the bad guy, the good guy from The Raid: Iko Uwais.While The Big Sick, or Kumail Nanjiani, is enormously hilarious, he's also gorgeous af and while that's true, I'd still take Iko any day and seven times on Sunday. TMI...Back to the Movie:Barely a new idea here: injured cop is in need of a driver while he's inches from catching the hunk who killed his partner. While that plot is basic and overused, the comedy of Nanjiani and chemistry with Drax is worth the entire stream price.I didn't count on how many times I laughed out loud and admired the humor from Nanjiani. I would love to watch this film again just to catch all his one-liners. Helps that's another excuse to yearn over both the underused Uwais villain and driver ""Steve.""***Final thoughts: I would love a sequel of this with just an edited week's worth of the title character driving. Especially if it's a truthful Uber Driver experience and has the Nanjiani humor attached.",Stuber
10,FeastMode,bad movie but mildly entertaining,4,7 November 2019,"This movie made me laugh a decent amount, although a lot of jokes flopped. some of the action was good, some wasn't. there was lots of dumb stuff and things you could pick at. and while it felt like a decent movie at times, there were many scenes that made me laugh when it wasn't trying to, and a few really cringe-worthy moments (1 viewing 11/6/19)",Stuber
11,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"Good car, blind cop.",6,13 July 2019,"'Stuber (2019)' is a very classic buddy-comedy with a slightly 'high concept' and two contrasting central characters. As such, it's pretty predictable and plays to the same sort of themes this genre is known for. However, it does almost much everything rather well - though, not exceptionally - and ends up being an entertaining, even somewhat endearing, experience overall. Part of its success comes from its willingness to go the extra mile and address some of the toxic masculinity associated with this kind of stuff, particularly that made in the 1980s. Sometimes, it seems ever-so-slightly hypocritical because it almost relishes in the violence that it perhaps ought to decry, also using it as a solution to its main plot, but it just about works because the characters develop alongside one another, learning from and picking up the best parts of one another's personalities. When everything comes together in the end, it's oddly satisfying. This is despite the fact that the flick isn't ever really funny. I mean, it's intermittently chuckle-worthy, but I wouldn't call it 'laugh-out-loud'. Still, it's charming enough and the comedy consistently comes from character. Basically, when it gets going, it's fun. So, even if the action is too shaky for its well-versed antagonist and its plot is probably too paint-by-numbers for its own good, the piece emerges as an enjoyable, easy-to-watch experience that doesn't so much as stand out from the crowd as comfortably sit within it. 6/10",Stuber
12,ThomasDrufke,The Marketing Almost Killed This,6,1 August 2019,"There are many reasons to be grateful for movie theater subscription cards, but the biggest one is that I find myself checking out movies I wouldn't normally have gone to see, mainly due to poor marketing. Stuber is the common case of an awful marketing campaign that turned out to be a pretty solid summer buddy film, with two rising stars in Hollywood in Nanjiani & Bautista. It borrows from many buddy-cop classics but their chemistry is enough to put some of the comedy that falls flat over the edge and bring some laugh out loud moments to the forefront. Granted, there were many big comedic scenes that were in the trailer, but that's inevitable in this day and age, and shows you even further how poor the marketing was for the film. It won't make enough money, but I could have definitely gone for more entries into this series with Bautista & Nanjiani.6.9/10",Stuber
13,westsideschl,Schizophrenic,6,31 October 2019,"It was inevitable that we would eventually get a movie centered about ride sharing services. A bit stereotyped w/a Pakistani driver for hire & a burly cop chasing the baddies. The creative hook is that our cop has some vision issues thus the need of a driver who, of course, gets enlisted (and rises to the occasion) in the busting of the baddies. A bit schizophrenic in that I couldn't tell whether it was meant to be comedic & laugh at the missteps or cringe at the mayhem. Acting & plot: Predictable, but somewhat enjoyable.",Stuber
14,The-Sarkologist,Missed Potential,3,18 July 2019,"Yeah, this movie was pretty bad. So, the question comes down to why I wanted to see it. Well, I haven't seen a film in a couple of weeks, namely because it seems to be the off season for films (which is probably a good thing) and the concept seemed to be okay, namely that a cop recruits his Uber driver to basically drive him around and bust some big time drug dealer that he has been after for quite a while. Yeah, the concept sounds okay, but in the end it fell pretty flat.In a way it is one of those buddy cop movies, and I don't mind the occasional buddy cop movies - they are cool, and you generally know what to expect. Mind you, they also tend to be incredibly unrealistic, considering the stuff that Vic pulled off in this film. Also, being a lawyer, I also wonder whether he has breached so many laws that the bad guy ends up getting off on a technicality (which is probably why they end up shooting them anyway).Look, it did have some funny moments in it, but honestly, it was so mind numbingly predictable that I really wanted to hit my head against a wall at times. Yeah, I knew who the Uber driver was going to end up pairing up with at the end, and like most Hollywood movies, it isn't the girl that he has been pinning over for so long.Of course, there is also the question of 'what's the damage'. Yeah, I sort of wonder how an Uber driver, on the small amounts of money that he earns, is going to be able to survive after these shenanigans. And of course, I also wonder how our not so friendly cop is going to pay for all of this as well.Oh, I probably should mention, that the reason the cop has an Uber driver is because he is blind - he starts off with glasses, but has laser eye surgery, and then gets a lead that he has to follow. Of course, having a half blind cop is probably something that adds a bit to the film, and they do play it up for what its worth. Still, in the end, even with that, it is pretty bad.",Stuber
15,slightlymad22,Better Than I Expected,6,12 July 2019,"I just got out of StuberI have to say, it was not as bad as I was expecting!! I honestly had no one tion if watching it, as I thought it looked awful. But I quite enjoyed it, it is disappointing to see the star and writer of the wonderful The Big Sick reduced to this role though.Nanjiani and Bautista's performances are both fun, but the screenplay really does then no favours at all, there is a whole friend zone subplot, that you think is headed somewhere, then it doesn't, there is another subplot that just seems to be thrown away too.The violence is plentiful and quite graphics, there are a few genuine laughs in there, but a lot of the jokes missed for me. There is quite a sentimental core at the centre of the movie, which was surprising,Trailers shown were

17,cruise01,Most laughs were seen in trailers.,5,17 October 2019,"Stuber (2.5 out of 5 stars.)Stuber is a buddy action comedy which sets a duo lead by Dave Bautista and Kumail Nanjiani. But the humor lacks half way through the movie, the story is forgettable, and there is nothing special about the action that makes it exciting.Dave Bautista and Kumail Nanjiani performances are dull. Yes, they play opposite characters. Bautista plays a detective who is trying to find the killer that killed his partner. He gets eye surgery which he cant drive to find the killer. He hires an uber driver played by Kumail Nanjiani. Which he is struggling to keep the 5 stars reviews. Yes, there is police corruption and predictable plot twist along the way. The film just lacks an interesting story to even care about.The action is nothing worth noting. It is forgettable. The performances are dull. The script lacks characterization to even care about them. It was funny for the first 15 minutes until it was repetitive jokes and humor.Overall, Stuber is a pretty bad film. Most of the laughs could be seen in the movie trailer. The humor is dull, the performances are dry, and the story is boring.",Stuber
18,eddie_baggins,No chemistry and no laughs make Stuber a rough ride,2,3 December 2019,"Stuber wants badly to act and feel like an 80's mismatched buddy comedy, and while it tries largely in vain to do so, Michael Dowse's film fails to bring the laughs while lead pair Dave Bautista and Kumail Nanjiani struggle to build a strong repertoire together as they fumble through this failed exercise.Set up to be in the same gene pool as heavy hitters such as 48 Hrs, Lethal Weapon and Rush Hour, Stuber on paper appears to be a comedic outing with potential and Dowse has proven with previous directing efforts Goon and What Ifthat he knows his way around a good time but from very early on in Stuber, an ultra-violent, loud and brash modern day comedy, you become aware that the laughs in this Uber-filled outing will be few and far between.Nothing feels natural in Stuber, from the way in which the bare-bones story takes place with Bautista's near blind Manning out to track down Iko Uwais's (in another terrible Hollywood outing) big blonde tipped baddie Oka while saddled up with Nanjiani's mild-mannered Uber driver Stu, through to the landing of jokes which 90 percent of the time don't even raise a slight chuckle, let alone a hearty belly laugh.You feel for Bautista and Nanjiani, as both have shown great comedic antics in the likes of the Guardians of the Galaxyfilms and The Big Sick respectively but both fail to fire here in a way that's hard to pin down, we're left unsure whether it's the material that was unsalvageable or if the two just don't really work together, which for a film like this is a sure fire way to ensure failure to launch.What's even more disappointing is that in a day and age where big screen cinematic comedy is fighting for its survival, a film conjured up in the spirit of the highs of 80's comedies feels like something many would enjoy watching and that many would pay good money to see but if this is the type of effort that's going to be produced and marketed as an outing worth visiting the multiplex for, the genre is in dire straits indeed.Final Say -Stuber wants to be a new-age 80's like comedy but comes across as nothing more than a pale imitation of the films it so desperately wants to be. With two off color leads at its centre and a large payload of unfunny jokes, Stuber is a ride you're best off avoiding.1 When Harry Met Sally viewing out of 5",Stuber
19,pmtelefon,It misses the mark.,5,8 December 2019,"I was happy when I saw the trailer to ""Stuber"". I would love to see the return of '80s style action comedies. However, this is not the movie that will jump start that genre. ""Stuber"" is a near miss. Dave Bautista has what it takes to make an action comedy work. I'm not writing him off. I am, however, writing off Kumail Nanjiani. Sure he got a couple of laughs out of me but, for the most part, I found him rather smug and annoying. Otherwise, despite the weak story, ""Stuber"" held my interest. It has more than a few laughs and a couple of nice moments. I especially enjoyed the wrap-up at the end.",Stuber

David Bautista plays his role pretty straight, and when the moment comes for it he throws in some laughs. But Kumail Nanjiani does bring more funny to his performance, he just handle every funny line with no problem, and he and Bautista have a funny odd couple like chemistry. Action are well done, and the bad guys are pretty menacing. Is it a great film, well no, but it never tries to be great, just an entertaining film.",Stuber

This is in the buddy/cop vein of action/comedy movies with Dave and Kumail as the cop and buddy, respectively. Dave has been in a constant pursuit of drug dealer/terrorist Iko for years, every since he killed Dave's partner. Mira plays his superior officer that takes him off the case and tells him to take some time off to get his mojo recharged. In his down time, Dave has some eye surgery so he has a problem seeing for several days-while it heals-so of course, that is when he gets a tip on the whereabouts of Iko. He can't drive-he has no partner, either-so he gets Kumail, an Uber driver, to chauffeur him around to different crime scenes and that's when the fun begins. I guess it depends on how much you like the chemistry between Dave & Kumail as to whether you will like this movie, but I thought that they worked together pretty good.
It's rated ""R"" for violence, language and sexual content-including nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 33 minutes.

In Real Life, a ride-sharing driver went PSYCHO, and gunned down six or twenty strangers before running out of gas. Being America's foremost Capitalist Film Studio, the people at Fox immediately asked themselves, ""How can we best monetize THIS?"" Their resulting flick--STUBER--does a bang-up job of turning America's frown upside down. Whereas the ACTUAL killer was a loser loner, STUBER handcuffs TWO such misfires together, with great comedic effect. While a paltry dozen or two killings may seem sad in Real Life, as the Death Toll mounts to STUBER proportions each demise gets funnier and funnier, particularly when creatively divided between nifty skull-splitting head shots, unexpected vehicle run-overs, colorful explosions, and so forth.

30,juneebuggy,Perfect quarantine movie,7,22 May 2020,"I got a lot of laughs from this. It isn't anything we haven't seen before in the buddy cop genre and its not fantastic as an action movie but It is the perfect movie to watch right now in these pandemic days. Easy turn your brain off entertainment. I had to rewind a couple times because I was laughing so hard.Story follows LAPD detective Dave Bautista after a clash with a wanted criminal that resulted in the death of his partner. 'Vic' vows to take down the bad guy which gets complicated after his Lasik eye surgery and the fact that now he's mostly blind and can't drive. Kumail Nanjiani is hilarious, he plays the hapless Uber driver, stuck on the case with a rage fueled Bautista, willing to do almost anything for a good rating. Usually ""hooks"" like the Lasik vison annoy me but this made me laugh. A great time waster.",Stuber
31,masonfisk,"NOT WORTH AN UBER, TAKE A CAB INSTEAD...!",1,1 August 2019,"Dave Bautista & Kumail Nanjiani star in this buddy action movie concerning a cop, who's just had Lasik surgery, needing to commandeer an Uber driver & his vehicle as he tracks down the killer who mowed down his partner in the film's opening. Feeling like a 90 minute gore infused, expletive laded commercial for Uber, this wrong-fisted comedy feels too violent to be taken lightly & too loud to be taken humorously. Feeling akin to the majority of the current comedies on display in today's multiplexes, this film feels the need to have either overly quirky leads delivering supposedly biting one lines & observations or having other characters speak in funny accents or lisps while espousing especially rank proclamations usually of the juvenile variety. Co-starring Natalie Morales as Bautista's daughter, action star Iko Uwais as the villain & fellow Guardian of the Galaxy member Karen Gillan as Bautista's partner.",Stuber

The Trailers Ruining Much Of the MovieSummaryThe truth about Stuber is that it is a simplistic comedy that the trailers have sold well. A fast pace helps keeps the laughs in as the ""story"" begins to work its way toward the final destination. There are components they are trying to balance into the laughs, and the morals placed in for character development are nice to see to help expand the character. Yet, the golden aspect of this film is of course the comedy to which many will most likely enjoy in some form or manner. Stuber is one of those movies that throws as many jokes at you as possible and hope that at least one or two of them sticks. The slapstick in particular has some great punch to it, primarily because of the commentary and sound effects that accompany it. So simplistic and yet so funny, Stuber makes it's mark due to the two comedians that drive the movie to the final destination. Bautista's yelling and direct line delivery are much like Drax without the Marvel banter and drawn out jokes that accompany the clumsiness they bestowed his character. Kumail Najiani on the other hand is all about dry sarcasm and delivery of the lines to capitalize on the comedic timing and adding that spice to the words. The chemistry between the two is great, though I hope it's not abused, and it will be a selling point for many.Yet the movie is much like my fellow critics said in that there are some dropped plot elements. For those that don't care about anything but a good laugh, this section will turn you off, but for those for looking at movies as a whole read it on. Although a good attempt, the story has a lot of dead points that barely roll over the finish line to really give the movie sustenance. A fantastic pace for comedy, the movie's short run time and fast movements are not good for developing the other parts of the movie, which is a shame given the potential they were building. Amidst the action scenes and lots of slapstick, a shaky camera awaits to try to bring you in the moment, but only serves to make dizzying sequences that are not too fun to see. In addition the story is super predictable, with lots of foreshadowing in the jokes and simple conversations early on in the movie. The balance in comedy is definitely skewed from one side or the other going too far down one angle, and quickly tipping the other way to not funny enough. Stuber suffers from constantly teetering from one point to the other and never learning that too much of something is not often a good thing. Why was this the case? Truth be told, it's because the trailers have revealed many of the scenes that fill the movie, with a good chunk of the funny parts already been beat into your eyes and memory from the countless trailers and commercials. If you have been fortunate enough to avoid these showings you'll be okay, but otherwise, stick to the mantra of there are some parts that are still waiting to be found.The VERDICT:
Stuber is fun, stuber is simple, and stuber is entertaining to those who want nothing more but to laugh. The acting combo of Bautista and Najiani are golden, filled to the brim with sarcasm and blunt delivery that should be entertaining. Filled to the brim with jokes, the movie's main limitation is the difficulty with balance, struggling to fit things into the comedy in such a short time span. Still, plenty of comedic gold awaits those looking for the simplistic adventure of slapstick and not caring about the movie/story overall.My scores are:Comedy/Action/Crime: 7.0
Movie Overall: 6.0",Stuber
34,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of Stuber,6,6 August 2019,"""Please be a 5-star ride"". Stuber (my latest review) doesn't get 5 stars but I guess 3 and a half will do. There's some tips included but it's not what you think (ha-ha).So OK, I'm not saying every Uber Driver should see Stuber (that's a cliche). But if you are one of those glorified taxi operators for hire, then this flick might amuse you slightly. We're talking ridesharing, clean cars, front seat conversations, smartphone apps, and everywhere LA destinations. Heck, next year I see studios making a film about Lyft starring a dude named Cliff. Or something about DoorDash. Or freaking Instacart!Directed by Canadian Michael Dowse, containing scenes that catapult troupers from one set piece to the next, and heralding itself as that rare, R-rated comedy from Disney, Stuber is hit-or-miss on the hysterical with some poorly choreographed action sequences. Call it a stupid-funny version of 2004's Collateral. Call it ""lethal deafen"". Call it ""Starsky and crutch"". Yup, you can call it ""blips"" (which rhymes with TVs CHiPs).The gist of Stuber involves a frazzled Uber Driver named Stu Prasad (hence the movie's catchy title). Stu picks up a near-blind cop in one of his rides. Said cop (Victor Manning played by Dave Bautista) is on the trail of a cold-blooded killer who murdered his rookie partner. Chaos ensues when Stu and ""Vic"" battle bad guys all night long with ""Vic's"" Uber bill topping off at just under six large (ouch).All in all, Stuber is a messy action farce that could've used a more attentive script supervisor and a stunt coordinator who didn't fall asleep at the cursory wheel (no pun intended Steven Ritzi). I did however, find the actors likable (Bautista is more emotive than The Rock) and there are some extremely funny and crass moments. In the cinematic world, Stuber is perceivable without being the equivalent of a more posh UberXL. Natch.",Stuber
35,Kamurai25,Sign me up for the Stuber Experience,7,11 May 2020,"Great watch, will watch again, and can recommend.While Kumail Nanjiani is a noted comedian, Dave Bautista is pretty funny guy himself. Granted its, easier for him to play a big burly action guy, he understand the mechanics of a funny scene and leans into it well.While the entire adventure is pretty funny, you'll notice a wonderful sliding scale in the amount of control each character has and the choices the make as the movie continues.They managed to blend a serious plot with a lot of adventurous comedy in a wonderful way with a successfully goofy premise.",Stuber
36,justin-fencsak,The best movie that makes fun of uber,10,23 July 2019,This modestly budgeted movie stars that Indian guy from the big bang theory as an Uber driver who is also a cop!!! Chock full of laughs and action this movie should be seen to be believed.,Stuber
37,Kingslaay,It had its moments but wished for more,6,21 June 2021,"Unlikely team ups are not new but if done right it could have been great. Batista and Stu make a decent and funny combo. The humour sometimes works and sometimes it doesn't. Batista's bad eyesight and not being good with technology worked. The plot could have been stronger, we all knew it was going to be another Mole known to Batista. Things also seemed too convenient with 20 guys shooting at two people moving slowly who escape unscathed. Despite this its silly mindless fun and it had some fun moments. This kind of movie is definitely worth being streamed for free instead of paying for it at theatres.",Stuber
38,vengeance20,Decent Comedy Action Flick,7,16 July 2019,"Wasn't expecting much from seeing 1 trailer of this film but went to see it as it's usually the type of film I'd go & watch anyway. It looked good & to be fair it was pretty much what I was expecting.The film is about an Uber Taxi driver who is forced to be a wheel man for a cop who is chasing down a criminal who killed his partner 6 months prior.The film I thought was pretty good & better than most of its type & genre. Though there were a few scenes & parts which either didn't fit, didn't work, went off the rails or simply just felt completely out of place. The film was pretty good & had an alright/consistent mix of comedy & action in its 1 hour & 27 minute run time.The actors were pretty good with the roles they were given, story-line was straight forward & not confusing & the film itself was quite engaging when you joined the duo on their off the rails journey.Overall I'd say it pretty good, not amazing as I did feel the film felt a bit all over the place, but it wasn't really bad so that was something. Go watch it, it IS good. 7/10",Stuber
39,fntstcplnt,Stuber (2019),5,10 April 2020,"Directed by Michael Dowse. Starring Kumail Nanjiani, Dave Bautista, Natalie Morales, Betty Gilpin, Mira Sorvino, Jimmy Tatro, Iko Uwais, Karen Gillan, Rene Moran, Steve Howey. (R)Detective Bautista is determined to take down baddie Uwais, but after laser eye surgery leaves him temporarily blind on the day he gets the chance, he recruits mild-mannered Uber driver Nanjiani into transporting him around the city, eventually involving him in the dangerous hijinks. Mildly agreeable but formulaic and forgettable buddy action/comedy operates the way most formulaic and forgettable buddy action/comedies do: limited interest, disposable action scenes, a few laughs scattered among the duds. The stars are in decent form, squeezing out smiles by virtue of their specific (if trope-reliant) personalities; trouble is, their appeal comes from individual quirks in a vacuum, not as a byproduct of their clash of personalities--their rapport is largely uninspired. It's a surprise to see Sorvino again in a major studio release, making it clear almost immediately what's going to become of her character; Uwais is tragically underused, absent for about an hour between the opening and climactic scenes.47/100",Stuber
40,arungeorge13,Expected better from a fresh combination such as Bautista-Nanjiani! [+40%],4,2 October 2019,"Short Review: Bautista and Nanjiani share great chemistry as a semi-blind cop and an Uber driver respectively, but it should have been utilized in a better-written screenplay (and thereby, a better movie!). The jokes in Stuber range from laugh-out-loud (few) to chuckle-worthy (more than few) to plain terrible (many). It's no surprise though that Nanjiani manages to nail most of his funny lines.Iko Uwais gets the role of a one-note baddie with negligible dialogue but he does what's expected of him in the stunts department. In fact, all characters (barring Nanjiani's) are pretty monotonous. Stuber isn't the comedic benchmark that Hollywood needs to look up to. Do I think the movie is watchable? Yes, but there's zero takeaway! Also, don't watch the trailer as it gives most of the jokes away.",Stuber
41,Abdulxoxo,Relatively amusing,6,15 January 2021,"This film knows exactly what it is; a sill action comedy flick. In terms of the comedy much of the best material is the physical slapstick stuff. The sight of Bautista walking/running/driving into things by mistake is fairly amusing. Also, Nanjiani has a few moments where his dead pan delivery is actually worth a small smile. In terms of the action there are some decent scenes with gun play and explosions. There is also a fight at the beginning between Vic and Tedjo which has the potential to be entertaining. The best scene is possibly a fight in a sporting goods store, which takes advantage of the products available in the store to make the fight kinda funny. The problem fthough is the editing. The way it keeps cutting frantically is annoying and fails to make the best use of Uwais' martial arts skills. I also don't think the supporting cast are used very well. For various reasons Betty Gilpin, Natalie Morales and Karen Gillan are all underused. I'd have like to have seen all 3 of those actresses with more to do.",Stuber
42,martimusross,Funny In Parts But Instantly Forgettable,6,17 July 2019,"StuberThis was very funny up to about half way through then it lost its way a bit.

Blend those together and you have some fun times.Now I have to be truthful. It was fun for a while, but went downhill pretty quickly. It got boring and bad after a bit.

45,muamba_eats_toast,Don't understand the hate,10,16 July 2019,Never went more than a couple of minutes without most of the screen laughing out loud including myself. Constant fun with the leads bouncing off each other. See it and give it the chance it deserves.,Stuber
46,rockman182,Stuber (2019),7,14 July 2019,"At first I thought that the film had such a dumb name. Then I was like okay, the guy's name is Stu and he drives an uber. Makes sense, still dumb. This is the first time I see Batsita getting a lead role. These WWE wrestlers making the transition to films has been a successful thing so far when you consider The Rock and John Cena. I think Kumail Nanjiani is a mixed bag in films but I really liked the chemistry between Kumail and Batista and thought this film was a fun ride.The film is about a hardened cop who recently got lasik eye surgery and cannot see anything throughout the day. It just so happens that on this day, a criminal he has been tracking for a while is scheduled to be at a drop and the cop needs to track him. he contacts an uber driver and the two go on a comedic but very dangerous journey together and get to learn deep secrets about the case and also get on each other's nerves along the way.Firstly, I've read a lot of critics slating this film. I disagree with almost everything I've read in reviews. This was a very funny and entertaining time. Nainjiani and Batista are not only funny but they play off each other so well. The film knows how to take in its audience and keep you consistent laughter flowing. Sure, the plot treads grounds we have seen before. This isn't a would be Oscar nominated film though, lighten up. Its a very funny buddy cop film with a duo that could be fun to watch in future things.I would say the writing for Betty Gilpin's character was bad. She is portrayed as a woman who keeps dating bad men and then has a plot of just wanting to have sex before her character just fades away. Shout out to Kevin from Shameless in this and having some great screen presence. What more can I say, without a critical lens, its a roaring good time at the cinema. Exactly, what you would expect from this type of film. These two leads will be in many more things.7.5/10",Stuber
47,RforFilm,Stuber is a 3 star rated ride: a serviceable ride that has only some good jokes,6,17 July 2019,"Unless you live in a big city, when was the last time you took a taxi? It's probably been a couple of years for me. For most, this is because the rideshare business' that are Uber and Lyft have overtaken in terms of use. It's a fantastic service that caters to people who want instant service from their smartphones. It's the kind of business that could have only debuted in this time period, but also thrive in this environment. It's also the kind of thing that has allowed more people work, as long as their willing to turn their car into a enterprise.I've spoken with several Uber drivers who've talked about the good times and bad times; the people going to work and the airport, but also the drunks and crazy people that try to eat their car seats. It's a compromise that cab drivers had been dealing with for decades, but is now more front and center with the downsides of being a driver. With misery means comedic potential. Given how new rideshare business are still, there's an empty gap that could be filled by someone who can tell a funny story. Let's see if Stuber can do this.An Uber driver Stu (played by Kumail Nanjiani) seems to have things figured out for himself; a work schedule that allows him to do this and his sporting goods job, along with the future prospect into opening a gym with his friend Becca (played by Betty Gilpin). Somewhere in LA, grizzled LAPD cop Vic Manning (played by Dave Bautista) is searching for his former partner's killer. He manages to get a lead...on the same day he had just gotten laser eye sugary. So half blind and a short time on the road that gets his car in a ditch, he calls for an Uber.Stu arrives with Vic demanding to go to Chinatown. After finding another officer dead, Vic asks for Stu to drive him around all day until the killer is found. Stu tries to decline, but Vic refuses to take no for an answer. As they drive around, Vic starts to understand how his gruff nature has pushed away a lot of people including his daughter while Stu see's that he's spinning his wheels, just waiting for something great to happen to him. The two fight and then agree to work with each other with Stu hoping he'll at least get a five star rating.Does Stuber do for Uber like what Caddyshack did for golf? It's a mixed bag. Stuber certainly has a funny story to work with. I think that the story of an Uber driver forced to drive for someone can be funny (this is basically a comedic version of Collateral). The problem? I only found it funny in parts. It's a movie that knows it needs two strong actors to keep the tone in place. And this is part of the problem: I thought that one actor did better then the other.This happens to be Dave Bautista. His performance as the no-nonsense cop reminds me of a Stallone or Schwarzenegger performance that would have been given years ago. He got a lot of laughs, especially given how half of his performance is the joke that he can't see. Think of him as a tougher Mr. Magoo. My problem steamed from Kumail Nanjiani. I could tell he was trying his hardest, but the script doesn't give him much other then a weakling personality. This should have been the highlight of the characters contrast, but I only laughed at him occasionally. I don't know if it was a poor script or a lack of direction, but he needed more work.I'll give this six Uber stickers out of ten. It's a good thing the movie is short at ninety minutes. The movie barley has enough steam to get all the way there. I think this movie were be serviceable to most people, especially those looking for a non offensive comedy on a rainy day. This is the equivalent of an Uber ride with a driver whose interesting, but not always structured well. Take what you will and see if you have the same opinion.",Stuber
48,bankofmarquis,Lack of chemistry between the leads,6,18 July 2019,"""Chemistry"" is a trick thing in a film and one that ""either you got it or you don't"" - it's an elusive element that can sink or raise a film. Case in point 2 films I have seen this week.I rewatched the 1998 Crime/Romance flick OUT OF SIGHT - starring George Clooney and Jennifer Lopez. I remembered this Steven Soderbergh directed film as ""terrific"" and was excited to show it to my bride. What I realized when watching it is that this is a middle-of-the-road film that is elevated by the tremendous (sexual) chemistry between Lopez and Clooney. It oozes off the screen and is palatable to the viewer.On the other end of the scale is the recent Action/Comedy STUBER with comedian Kuamil Nanjiani (THE BIG SICK) and former pro wrestler Dave Bautista (Drax in the GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY films). This is a middle-of-the-road film that is hurt (tremendously) by the LACK of chemistry between the two leads.Nanjiani stars as Stu, a sad-sack Uber driver who does not stand up for himself while Bautista is a ""nothing gets in my way"" take charge cop who (because of recent eye surgery) cannot drive and hires an Uber driver, Stu (who gets called STUBER, hence the name of the film), to chase down clues to a criminal he's been on the hunt for - shenanigans ensue.Individually, some of the scenes/scenarios of this film are fine/funny and Nanjiani is terrific as Stu and adds some clever comedic elements to a script that is ""good enough"" by Tripper Clancy.And then there's Bautista.He seems lost in this film, underplaying the things that make him good, his over-exuberance and over physicality (if that is a term) of someone of his size. Is this Bautista's fault or did Director Michael Dowse (GOON) purposely tone him down? It doesn't really matter for it doesn't really work.And this is the beginning of the problem with the chemistry between the two leads - Nanjiani manic energy is not matched by Bautista - he seems to be an ""energy sucker"" and takes quite a bit of life out of this film. But...Director Dowse is also a problem, for he brings this lack of energy to quite a few of the big action scenes, underplaying, not overplaying what should have been over played.There are some good things in this - besides the script and Nanjiani, Natalie Morales and Betty Gilpin are good and we do have a ""Mira Sorvino sighting"", which is welcome...but that's about it. Oh...except for an extended cameo by Karen Gillan (Nebula in the GUARDIANS films) she brings some energy. I would have loved to see her paired with Nanjiani in this.If you're looking for a good ""buddy cop"" film with good chemistry between the leads, might I suggest THE OTHER GUYS (Will Ferrell/Mark Wahlberg), RUNNING SCARED (Billy Crystal/Gregory Hines) or the greatest example of strong chemistry - 48 HOURS (Nick Nolte/Eddie Murphy). Stuber would be the example of just the opposite.6 stars out of 10 (for Nanjiani, Gillan and Sorvino - and a script and circumstances that could have worked had the chemistry between the leads been better)Letter Grade: B- and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",Stuber
49,markthomassintek,Uber meets Dead Pool,7,25 July 2019,"REVIEW - STUBERIt seems these days that wrestlers are following the path led by the rock and Dave Bautista is well down that same path especially after starting in Guardians Of the Galaxy.Question, when watching Dead Pool do you remember the banter between the taxi driver and Dead Pool? Imagine taking that further and making a buddy cop movie based on that, this film is the child of such an imagination and......Honestly I wasn't expecting much from this film as the write up (synopsis) didn't inspire but I watched it anyway and.....Genuine laugh out loud moments throughout the film and the clash of the modern hugging sensitive man opposed to the tough guy actually added to the whole film and yes I will admit, even though you can turn your brain off with this film I did actually enjoy it.Uber meets Dead Pool meets all of the buddy cop movies ever made and it actually works, its just a fun watch.Rating 7 out of 10",Stuber
50,kjproulx,A Missed Opportunity For These Actors,4,12 July 2019,"Comedy is one of the hardest genres to accomplish successfully. It has always been that way and it will always be that way. Most jokes, especially today, feel like retreads of older gags or too familiar to others. For this reason alone, it seems like less and less memorable mainstream comedies hit the big screens every year, which is really disappointing. Stuber is the next film in the long line of recent disappointing comedies and while it does have its moments, it's not worth spending your time or money at the movies on.Following Vic Manning (Dave Bautista), a police officer who has been having trouble with his eyesight, he finds himself being picked up by Stu (Kumail Nanjiani), an Uber driver with no self-confidence, and together they end up working a violent case that Vic has been involved in for a while. Obviously, with a premise like this, chaos begins to ensue and the movie becomes more about the characters than the overall plot, and while that does work sometimes, Stuber is far too cliche of a comedy to really feel for them or get any big laughs in general.Going into this movie, I was already a huge fan of Kumail Nanjiani and Dave Bautista. Both for different reasons, but I was curious to see what they could bring to the table as an unlikely duo. They're easily the sole aspect that made this movie remotely enjoyable. There are a few instances that had me chuckling, but from set-ups that will clearly pay-off in the final act to over-the-top fight scenes to keep the audience engaged, a lot of this movie felt forced.On top of the forced nature of these elements, the overall direction of the action sequences was terrible in my opinion. With the use of the visceral shaky-cam technique, the action honestly felt like it belonged in a different movie altogether. Directed by Michael Dowse, I'm a fan of his movies Take Me Home Tonight, Goon, and The F Word, but those movies aren't exactly known for having good action scenes. I would say that this particular piece of directing felt like a mixture of action and comedy that didn't quite blend very well overall.In the end, Stuber begins as a fine concept (which is also great advertising for the Uber app) but ultimately plummets as it tries to be funny during moments that would have otherwise been taken seriously during a dramatic film. The two leading men are a blast to watch, even if they aren't given much to work with, and I believe they would've made an even better team with better material. Stuber had potential in theory, but the execution is everything and this one missed the mark for me, more often than not.",Stuber
51,Neptune165,Iko's first comedy!!,4,6 October 2019,"Kumail nanjiani has to be the most boring actor ever. Daughter is older than daddy bad actress. Some terrific action sequences, and some very hilarious moments. The only real problems were that Batista is kind of weak as the main character. The film was not good. Batista cannot carry a film, the plot was pointless, and majority of the laughs were in the trailer. Major disappointment. The jokes didn't land - not a single one. Kumail Nanjiani was annoying whenever he opened his mouth. The degenerate attempt at comedy failed miserably in this one. Camera shaking when fights occur was annoying. Stuber started off so badly. For the first 30 minutes of the movie, this movie was bad all jokes fell flat I was literally falling asleep. I mean how can Batista shoot a guy in the head just from the guy making a cat meow? He couldn't shoot the target practice paper head that he should know where it is by now without his glasses. And idk why people thought Kumail Nanjiani was funny I didn't laugh at any of his ""funny"" lines. Movie was bad.",Stuber

If I had caught this at the cinema, my review might have been lower. The story and villain is a little flat and all the heavy lifting is done by the lead team up.

53,bopdog,Good cast in a weak and sloppy story,5,13 July 2019,"Any honest review would be, likely, misleading. There ARE funny gags here and there and decent moments - but overall the narrative is clunky and coarse. Not much fits together. It's as if this was only the second draft of a project that would ultimately need five or eight drafts to be good.The secondary characters were haphazard, and many were not at all fitted into the Big Story. Certainly no sense of an ensemble. I will avoid all potential spoilers, so let me just say that several outstanding female actors played characters who just sort of showed up, related to nothing, then moved on. That was perplexing. One Oscar winner's character in this was so obscure I honestly can't place her now. Hahaha!Enough said without names - but that disjointed, unexplained aspect was rife throughout the movie. I'd say this movie would more accurately be a 4, but I scored upwards because they tried hard. So a ""5"" score is actually generous.I actively ignored the quality of the movie, and the texture of the narrative, as one does when watching a ""proof of concept draft"" or a very early and rough draft. If it was bad in that passage, I just let it be bad, and breeze on by me. I didn't try to analyze it or look too closely. Doing that, half watching and half ignoring it, I was able to stay in the theater to the end. Overall, I kind of enjoyed myself, although will not be bothering with the DVD.P.S.

Action-Comedy is one of the toughest blends to pull off. Each piece needs to fall into their designated places; otherwise things could easily go sideways!Stuber in that regard worked out pretty well.It had its fair share of comedy, some genuinely funny punchlines & whimsical situations that did make me chuckle.
The focal point should be the terrific chemistry shared by the two lead actors.
Although not upto their finest, Kumail Nanjiani & Dave Bautista; both of them being vastly good in here.
What about the others? You may ask...
Well they haven't got much screentime to begin with. Hence, a comparatively less significant outcome.The storyline is generic and banal to be honest. But these are supposed to be like that!
I'm trying real hard not to be super analytical here. It served its purpose as an entertainer.
And I'm quite satisfied with that!
Though I would have definitely loved a better script & more profoundly rooted characters.",Stuber
56,TheTruthofItIs,A new comedy duo?,7,12 October 2019,"So first we have ""The Rock"" and diminutive Kevin Hart teaming on a few comedy films, now it looks like they're pitching us ""The Animal"" and ""Silicon Valley's"" Kumail for another comedic duo. ""Stuber"" is a fun little jaunt, not to be taken seriously of course, but it's a fun little ride with its cute little moments mostly deriving from Bautista's Hulk-like approach to situations against Kumail's electric-car prissy-ness.

61,trinaboice,Not as terrible as everyone says,8,14 July 2019,"It was only a matter of time that we were going to get a movie about an Uber driver, right? This isn't quite a 5-star ride, but it has moments that will make you laugh out loud. Dave Bautista and Kumail Nanjiani make an unlikely, but entertaining duo. If you're looking for an excuse to eat buttery popcorn in an air-conditioned theater, go for it. Otherwise, this one can wait until live streaming or Redbox. I wonder how much Uber paid to be connected with this movie.TIPS FOR PARENTS:Crude jokes
Lots of profanity, including F-bombs
LOTS of bloody fighting
Bloody, gory deaths, dead bodies
People in peril
DestructionTHEMES:Family, fatherhood
""Real men listen to their feelings."" - Stuber (Kumail Nanjiani)
""Sometimes people need help and it's not a sign of weakness to ask for it."" - Stuber
THINGS I LIKED:I'm happy to see Dave Bautista get a movie with him as the starring role. I really like him and hope he has a successful movie career like Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson. These wrestlers are performers at heart, right? There's a funny line in the movie about what Dave Bautista's ethnicity is from. He's actually an American from Washington D.C.
Kumail Nanjiani has established himself as a reliable comedian who can throw out some dramatic pauses, like in The Big Sick He does a great job in this movie.
Fans of Guardians of the Galaxy (Theatrical) will get a kick out of seeing Karen Gillan and Dave Bautista together in the beginning without all of that MCU makeup on.
There's a lot of action. Be prepared for John Wick style, rated-R action with blood and guts. A lot of it features the talented Iko Uwais who was actually National Champion of Silat martial arts in 2005.
I've always loved the song Come Sail Away by Styxx, so it was fun to hear it in the movie as a running gag.
I hadn't seen Mira Sorvino in a while and I like Natalie Morales, so I was good to see both of them in the film.
Lots of humor with quotable one-liners.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:Betty Gilpin's character is a complete trashy skank that makes girls look overly emotional and dumb. Her character provides some of the urgency and motivation for Stuber, so I get it.
Full of every cop cliche: death of a partner, unlikely partners, mole in the force, frustrated family member, flawed hero, etc.
Some of the scenes in the trailer aren't even in the movie. I love the line: ""It's a baby gun. It allows you to shoot while crying."" Sadly, that one wasn't in the film.
The plot wanders around.
Jimmy Tatro plays a real duche-bag who had some of the most vulgar lines in the movie. Despite that, he added a funny side character.

The comedy was very hit and miss for me. It never had me laughing out loud, often only cracking a smirk.One of my main problems is I'm not entirely sure about Dave Bautista as a co lead in a comedy. Maybe the creators were inspired by John Cena in Blockers and thought that lightening could strike twice. Unfortunately not in this case. It's a shame because Bautista was good at executing the comedy in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, so I'm not sure what went wrong here. The script wasn't overly tight which doesn't help. Perhaps the chemistry wasn't quite there with Kumail. I don't know. Something just felt off.Overall I don't think the plot was a bad concept, and had lots of comedy potential. Kumail was good, delivering a millennial focused comedy script which was actually quite clever in parts, but never really took off. Honestly I'm not entirely sure I remember laughing at any of Bautista's lines. Ultimately I think Stuber was quite muddled, and failed to capitalise on its full comedic potential.Despite all of the above, I have still given this a 6/10, which I consider a respectable score in my book. Yes, it wasn't continually hilarious and failed to hit the mark with its comedy on many counts, but it was still very entertaining. The plot had a few twists and turns, Kumail's Stu was a funny character, and the concept was unique enough to keep me intrigued.Worth a watch for sure but I wouldn't put it towards the top of your list.",Stuber

Obviously, with a premise like this, chaos begins, i was surprised that i didn't know
(Mira Sorvino) Angie McHenry was in this movie i haven't seen that actress for awhile i loved her in replacement killers, Mimic i thought threw out of film it had great action, great pacing, a lot of laughs it brings everything on table i thought Bautista acted well in a comedy film and series films as well, this had tons and tons of action in it as well the action was pretty fun. the problem is the trailer of movie has spoiled everything because they put all the jokes in movie they show entire movie as well these days everything spoils trailers they show too much of it as well that's why this movie for everyone is not that
excited because they show too much in trailer too much of action scenes, too much jokes threw out entire movie people if you never seen the trailer or never heard of movie i highly recommended watch film because trailers these days take everything away. The writing was great and worked perfectly with the way Stu and Vic interacted with each other. Additionally, the plot was great. Again, it was original and modern. It really felt different from any other comedy I've seen and also it's very refreshing It may not be the most realistic movie, but it's a hilarious ride. Great characters, perfect casting, and good laughs means I'll likely go see it again and buy it on blu ray down the road i liked movie it's so good believe me people it's not terrible as it seems from reviews screw the reviews what do they know whatever go and see it for yourself have a great time refresh your mind as well from another movies as well. sadly if you didn't watch the trailer as i did Some of the scenes in the trailer aren't even in the movie. I love the line: ""It's a baby gun. It allows you to shoot while crying."" Sadly, that one wasn't in the film. but who knows deleted scenes but hopefully we get to see that scene on DVD and Blu ray hopefully for me in some movies i hate false advisement like that. and film doesn't over act as well like Dave Bautista or Kumail Nanjiani or anybody of movie they don't over act in this movie. People have no joy sometimes in these type of comedy movies sadly enough i rate this 10 out 10 look their problems like false advisement and shaky camera really pissed me off edge but it doesn't make me to hate the film at all and running time is like 93 minutes very fast paced, full on action, a lot of laughs in movie.",Stuber

72,Magow-Intermean,Stuber Review,9,10 July 2019,"There are buddy comedies that work, there are buddy comedies that don't, and Stuber is one that very much falls into the second category. Some of the most critical elements of a good buddy comedy are connection and chemistry because if you don't connect with the characters, you don't really care about them. Bottom line, if the characters don't have chemistry, whatever else you pack in there isn't going to work effectively, and the chemistry isn't there on-screen. Both Dave Bautista and Kumail Nanjiani work with what they've got, but that's not a lot and what they've got lacks spark.
Nanjiani plays Stuart (Stu for short), a lovelorn and generally mild-mannered Uber driver who picks up Vic, played by Bautista, a cop on the hunt for the bad guy who killed his partner. Vic can't drive himself around LA as he's had Lasik eye surgery earlier that day so can't see correctly. As a result, Stu is thrust into a pursuit that takes him all over the city, not only putting him in the line of fire but it also means he can't get to the recently single friend, and new Spin Cycle business partner, he is secretly in love with so they can have sex. On top of that, Stu has to make sure he does an excellent job so that his Uber rating doesn't drop otherwise he'll lose his job. It's like if Speed swapped out the bomb and staying above 50 miles per hour for customer service feedback and a booty call with none of the tension. There are two things that Stuber needed to get beyond tropes and afford it some good grace when it comes to papering over the cracks: good comedy and good action. There are plenty of moments within the movie where both are present but rarely do they meet their true potential. For an R-rated comedy, Stuber throws away the opportunity to go hard and embrace the madness and chaos.
It is almost like the film doesn't have the confidence to push things that extra bit further. Stuber could really do with being much bolder, crazier, and far edgier. Sadly, Stuber can't hold a candle to the likes of action comedies and mismatched buddy comedies such as 48 Hrs., 21 Jump Street, The Heat, and the list goes on and on. Whether it was a conscious decision to dial it down, or the material simply wasn't there to allow them to dial it up, it's hard to tell, but the end result lacks balls. Despite Stuber's fundamental shortcomings, some moments do land well and get a reaction, whether that's a solid laugh, a wince or an audible 'oof.' However, these successes only serve to highlight further the parts that don't work or feel undercooked or merely lazy. Something I will give Stuber is that it's probably the only movie that will provide audiences with a Simon Birch reference this year. While it is Bautista and Nanjiani who take center stage in a movie that generally underwhelms, the blame shouldn't be laid entirely at their feet. In a film like this, the cast is only as good as the material they are given, but the script isn't strong enough and, apart from one or two moments, the action set pieces aren't bold or exciting enough. Now, if it's a case of the lead cast improvising dialogue, that's a risk that hasn't paid off for the most part. When it works, it works, but that's not often enough.
As far as the supporting cast goes, Mira Sorvino, Iko Uwais, Jimmy Tatro, Natalie Morales, Betty Gilpin, and Karen Gillan, are all wasted being either underserved by the narrative or just underdeveloped as characters. Morales as Bautista's daughter, Tatro as Stuber's boss, and Gilpin as the recently dumped and horny friend could all have been utilized far better.
Director Michael Dowse does a competent job but not a lot more. There are few stylistic flourishes or stand out sequences, but nothing that goes above and beyond what you might expect. Had there been more to Stuber, I would have been open to a sequel as the buddy comedy genre is somewhat underserved these days, but there's not enough potential realized here to warrant that.
Stuber is an awkward, uneven action-comedy that never realizes its full potential. It squanders a good premise and an odd couple pairing with potential that could have delivered something special. Stuber reaches its destination, but the journey is far from memorable and mostly underwhelming.",Stuber
73,angelsunchained,A Few Laughs,5,12 July 2019,"Far from the greatest film ever made, but good for a few laughs. Nothing to take too seriously, just a decent movie to occupy a rainy day.",Stuber
74,mister_bateman,Vulgar trash,3,22 November 2019,"I will admit the movie has its funny moments but the dull and stupid ones far outweigh them. Also, when you laugh you sort of feel guilty as you are reminded so harshly and clearly of humanity's downward spiral back to the stone age.The humor consists mostly of the usual modern toilet/genital theme and formulaic 'awkwardness' derived from the interplay betweeen the masculine main character and his really effeminate, nu-male counterpart whose voice and mannerisms are quite hard to bear if you have a somewhat healthy testosterone level.
California is depicted like the total cosmopolitan hellhole it is, which really helped immersion. The only significant people of European descent in the movie, of course, are a blonde girl dating an African guy (and getting cheated on by him), and the bad guys.
Can we just bring on the stone age right now, so we can get this ""epoch"" over with already?",Stuber

I've NEVER in my life hated a cameraman more in my life!! The action, the sole reason I wanted to watch this, is simply RUINED by the sloppy job they did at recording this.. even when people are simply moving / walking around. It blurs and jumps around, and never focuses properly on the movements. Jackie Chan said it : ""When the camera moves, it's because the actors don't know how to fight"". Which is hilarious, since they got Iko Uwais to act in it.So.. WHY!? If this is an artistic choice, it stinks.I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. In fact, I wish I hadn't seen it..

director: Michael Douse
starring: Dave Bautista,Kunal Nanjiani,Karen Gillan,Iko Iwais,Mira Sorvino,Natalie Morales etc
overall rating 54/100Stuber was a mostly fun and entertaining film that couldn't help but fall into the forgettable side of comedy films as it just fizzled out towards the 2nd half of the film lets talk about why this is.Firstly the film actually had very entertaining action sequences and good amounts of gore. The film did manage to keep me fairly consistently entertained with its hard hitting and edge of the seat action with inventive ways of causing entertainment and pain. The gore also added to the impact of the scenes as well and it was the perfect amount to make you love the action and not want to look away.Next i thought the villain was fantastic. Iko Iwais has really been on a role recently with these types of characters within films. Due to his martial arts training any action sequences involving him always have jaw dropping kicks and moves that you dont see anywhere else and Stuber was no different.However as a slight negative i would like to see Dave Bautista go more out of his comfort zone with acting and try and take on different roles. I just think he has gotton to used to playing the loud over the top hero and he needs to maybe try different roles to test his acting abilities. Also his character was incredibly dislikable during the film as well. His character was rude to everyone and became so obsessed with completing his task that he pushed everyone away and did not get close to everyone. I just did not connect to his character until the very end of the film were for me that was to late. And another thing it was a bit odd to have a blind cop as the main character. It just did not make a lot of sense and was an overplayed joke that got boring after a while as he just kept on running into everything and not getting anywhere.Next i thought the acting and the humour was solid. The film despite not being consistent with its humour still managed to land many jokes. This was mostly due to Kunal nanjianis comedic talent. He has a natural comedic charm were even if something he says is not that funny he somehow manages to pull it off. The acting from Dave bautista natalie morales
and Mira sorvino was also solid and watchable with each of there characters shining throughout different parts of the film.
However i felt this film was unfortunately very generic which held it back for me. It still followed the generic cop comedy drama that we have seen multiple times in things like central intelligence and Ride along. With the traditional muscular character who destroys the villains and the comedic sidekick who is the funny and nerdy one who always gets in the way. The film did nothing to branch away from this genre stereotype so this loses a few marks for me.Next my final two positives. Firstly i loved the backstory of the lead characters reasoning for targeting the villian for so long. Karen Gillan did a good job with the little screen time she had and her dieing really made you understand how the main character was feeling and made you dislike the villian even more so this was executed well its a shame there couldn't be more detailed backstories like these throughout the whole film. And finally the plot twists were entertaining. To have Dave Bautistas characters boss who he trusted with keeping him on the mission to find the villain only for her to be the main antagonist was a smart move from the people behind this film and made for a entertaining yet short lived final act.Finally however i have to end on my final two negatives. First of all following on from my previous paragraph about there needing to be more character arc and development i thought there was a lack of this between Dave Bautistas character and his daughter. There was never a real explanation into why there relationship was so distant just briefly talked about. It would of been nice to perhaps have flashbacks or just some form of recognition into the reasoning for there difficult relationship. And finally as the film went into its second half the humour for me started to fall flat. They were starting to recycle and overuse blind jokes and it just ended up being two guys being silly and falling over everything which is a shame as if the humour stayed consistent my score would of been a fair amount higher.Overall Stuber is a passable cop comedy with some good but not consistent elements to it and unfortunately adds nothing new to the genre.",Stuber
78,thebricks,Pretty good watch but you've definitely seen this before.,8,14 July 2019,"Definitely worth a watch. Critics were pretty wrong about the film. Bautista and Kumail definitely make the pairing work very well. Many of the jokes were great too, some more subtle than others, especially with Bautista eating at the Chinese restaurant at the end. Was the plot original? In some ways yes, others, definitely not. There was definitely a lot of inspiration from Rush Hour going on here, shamelessly. I definitely could have written a better plot twist that would have worked.Only one major plot hole; the boss of the Sporting Goods store needs Stu to drive him around in LA? Why does he not own a car?",Stuber
79,ayoreinf,"Don't suspend your disbelief, just don't bring it in.",7,15 July 2019,"If the story was making sense, I would've rated this little movie 9 stars easily. But even as is, without making any sense, plot wise, all through the movie, this was loads of fun. A good buddies comedy with all the expected cliche, with jokes and surprises that surprise none, but with real good acting that breathes life into cartoon characters. And I do think that Dave Bautista is very underrated as an actor, he showed some real comic talent as a Guardian of the Galaxy, and he shows it here again, and then some. While Kumail Nanjiani who played the same role he played in The Big Sick, does it with tons of charm, and I never minded actors who play themselves, over and over again. I think, real versatility is a rare gift, but what's really important is being convincing when one plays a role, and not if this role is different from the previous one. And both of the leading actors excel in this department, which is the main redeeming quality of this movie.As for the other aspects of movie making, it's all very professional. The pace is as relentless as it should be, the special effects are as one expects them to be. Bottom line it's a well done action comedy that will give you exactly what you want from an action comedy, as long as you don't expect too much, like a plot that makes sense.",Stuber
80,movieman6-413-929510,The action scenes are entertaining than the comedy scenes in this action comedy.,4,13 July 2019,"Tuber is a new action comedy directed by Michael Dowse, the director of It's All Gone Pete Tong and The F Word.In the film, police officer Vic Manning (Dave Bautista) had his eyes lasered, so he had to take it easy for a few days and actually was not allowed to work. If he receives information that drug criminal Oka Tedjo (Iko Uwais), who has been chasing him for a long time, has planned another drug action, Vic wants to try and stop him and arrest him.
Vic therefore decides to arrange an Uber. Uber driver Stu (Kumail Nanjiani) is an honest but sober man who tries to do everything to get a five-star rating from his passengers. With Vic as his passenger, he suddenly experiences an exciting danger where he must serve as a driver and as a couple of extra good eyes. To give Vic a good service and hopefully to be worthy of a five-star rating, Stu must learn to undergo more dangerous activities, which he preferred to avoid for this ride in his quiet life.This is an exaggerated but entertaining action comedy if you don't expect too much. The far-fetched extreme action scenes provide the best entertainment. The comedy surrounding the action can cause some chuckling, but is further disappointing compared to the action in this film.
The most entertaining comedy elements are also repeated too often, so that after the umpteenth time they are no longer so funny. The agent in the film, for example, sees poorly and often thinks he sees something while it is actually something else, or he runs into something again for the umpteenth time.
The comedy and the rest of the story also become somewhat predictable at a point in the film. As a viewer you can see what will happen and where they will go with the story.The acting is done nicely by the two main characters. Dave Bautista and Kumail Nanjiani are opposed to each other physically and personally in the film, but during the film they learn that they are necessary to each other and that they can learn from each other. Dave Bautista takes care of the entertaining exaggerated action in the film and Kuamil Nanjiani tries to provide some comic moments during the Uber ride.",Stuber

82,srdjan_veljkovic,A decent action comedy with a great Ryan Gosling joke,6,6 November 2019,"Action is OK, nothing special but also not unrealistic as is usual these days.Comedy is a little one-sided, it all falls down to Stu(ber) being weird, small and weak but Bautista being big, strong and emotionally challenged. But, it has a few good jokes and several decent ones, while the rest, even though not very funny, are OK, it doesn't feel like it's trying to hard. It's merely doing too much, but not by much.Directing and story are mostly OK for a comedy, it makes sense, even though it's pushed way to far, but you mostly have to do that in a comedy. The leads do a decent job. Other actors, not so much. Mira Sorvino shows us that she still can't act and the rest are mostly going through the motions - Karen Gilan cameo is also uninspired, but it is very short and at the very start, so it doesn't matter much.The Ryan Gosling joke is great, though. It easily makes the whole movie worth watching. It's at about the ""center"" of the movie, which does make you kind of disappointed that there isn't any more like it after.There was a potential for more, but, as-is, it's OK, worth a watch.",Stuber
83,SafReviews,I knew it was going to be average,6,16 December 2019,"Yes this is one of those average action-comedy movies where the plot is not that great and you want it to end, but luckily it wasn't that long. There were a few funny moments in the movie, especially from Kumail who I thought was good in the movie. Personally, I didn't like Dave Bautista's character in the movie and felt he was stupid because (spoiler alert) he couldn't see properly and was trying to solve a case, that too by himself at first. There's too many average action-comedy movies these days which seem like they are too repetitive or the plot is just not interesting enough.",Stuber
84,leesimon-26357,Not what I wanted to see and not something I'd see again,3,28 February 2021,"I was hoping for a fight movie. I personally found that there was very little violence. There were basically only 2 fist fights that bookend this movie, with a few gun fights in the middle.
The story is incredibly secondary, in that it is lazily written and filled with very stupid plot holes. I would have been ok with that, if there was more fighting. But I accept that I had a biased expectation that a Bautista movie would be filled with crazy acrobatic punching and kicking scenes. The action wasn't bad and it seems like all of the production values went towards those scenes. Too many other things are totally phoned in. For example, tracking down a character to a particular location and just explaining ""they tracked your car here."" No other explanation given; no gps tracker in the car, no mention of a license plate, no explanation why civilians can just ""track"" cars. Every plot development is just that lazily written. No explanation for how things progress, just progress.
The humor was not my personal taste. It seemed like lowest common denominator type of humor. The score is one point for every time I smiled during the movie. Full of clichés, very dumb story, very predictable, no tension, no excitement, and hugely disappointed in Najiani's role.
I definitely won't see this again. Maybe good as a kids movie?",Stuber

90,quaseprovisorio,not awful but nothing special,5,28 May 2020,"Ok, the good things: i thought the action sequences better than most reviews i read. I think at least they're entertaining and work in the film. some moments of shock where stu can't believe what's happening work. The pace is not awful either, the moviw wants to be a fun action comedy picture and sometimes suceeds.problems: the secondary cast doesn't have much to do. besides our main characters the rest are just pawns in order to make the script moving. They're not dense by any means nor they have a personality - i do think some actors like mira sorvino or karen gillian were definitely undervalued here - they deserved more screentime. actually all the women in this movie deserved more time.I also don't think the chemistry between the lead actors was that good - i felt a lot of times they were just screaming on top of each other instead of making a conversation. I didn't feel they completed each other so well and that's probably the main problem here since we spend 98% of the screen time with them. most of the dialogue doesn't help either because it's just too formulaic. they both try to save it but on their own way, not by working together. this is just my perception obviously.now i can't say this is awful because it isn't: it entertains and has some good moments. but in general it could be way better and i believe it was a missed opportunity to make a col action comedy buddy movie. too bad.",Stuber

95,MinistryofDoom,A Less than Thrilling Thrill Ride,6,6 October 2019,"Pretty much if you've watched any previous buddy cop movie, you know the plot of this one: Cop's partner is killed. Cop gets a tip that leads him towards killer of partner. Cop teams up with a wacky partner. They track down killer and get into all sorts of trouble along the way. This feels like a routine buddy cop movie like we've seen many times before. Every couple of years another one comes along but the twist here is one of the buddies is a civilian uber driver.Stuber had it's genuinely funny moments. Unfortunately, they were far and few between the incessant annoying fits of complaints and shouting by Uber driver, Stu, who was all but kidnapped and roped into tagging along with Dave Bautista's Detective Vic. Kumail Nanjiani does his best to be annoying, wimpy, and an overall irritant to the macho badassery that Bautista exudes. On the scale of buddy cop characters, Nanjiani is somewhere between Danny Glover's Murtaugh (Lethal Weapon) and Will Ferrell's Allen Gamble (The Other Guys), while also out-ranking Hooch the dog (Turner & Hooch), and Tracy Morgan in Cop Out. Unfortunately, he can't compare to Martin Lawrence in Bad Boys, or Theodore Rex the anthropomorphic dinosaur detective in Whoopi Goldberg's 1995 film of the same name. Bautista, for his part, does everything that you want him to do. He's basically Drax the Destroyer...but as a cop. He grunts, he growls, he fires off one-liners and awkward jabs at his partner, but mostly he beats the crap out of stuff...and people....but mostly stuff. Sporting goods stuff.This isn't a bad movie at all. Sure the jokes are bland, the dialogue is eye-rolling bad, and half way through the film Stu becomes so incredibly annoying that he makes you want to literally punch yourself in the face. However, it is a thrill ride for roughly an hour and a half. Well, a less than thrilling thrill ride, but a thrill ride, nonetheless. It's a borderline average buddy cop movie at best, certainly nothing award worthy, but atleast you'll be mildly entertained. So if you have one of those nights where you want to be mildly entertained, without the risk of being too entertained, this movie is for you.",Stuber

I did like the story going on, but every 5 minutes the audience got reminded, that stu (Nanjiani) is an Uber driver. They missed a chance to make a pretty good movie for doing a commercial with cool characters. They should better make the commercial more decent.

98,bastille-852-731547,"Uber Comedy Has a Good Concept, but a Terrible Execution",2,27 June 2019,"I saw this at an advance screening, and went in hoping for the best. Given the popularity of ride-sharing services such as Uber and Lyft, I thought the idea for a buddy comedy about Uber could be both entertaining and timely, and the film has two strong leads (Kumail Nanjiani and Dave Bautista.) Unfortunately, this was a dreadful attempt at action comedy that has some (surprisingly) visceral action scenes, yet fails miserably at virtually every other aspect.The film centers around a highly aggressive LAPD officer (Bautista) looking for a brutal heroin dealer. However, he cannot drive to the locations that he needs to go to due to his Lasik surgery affecting his vision. As a result, he gets in an Uber with a mild-mannered, composed driver (Nanjiani) trying to keep his star rating up, who has to keep going around with him to stop the dealer. The film's plot generally consists of going from point A to point B and point C, which is fine, but the story's narrative never manages to take any structural risks. As a comedy, ""Stuber"" falls pretty flat. While there are a few mildly amusing lines of dialogue, the humor is an awkward mishmash of cheap jokes about Uber, raunchy R-rated jokes, weak puns, and erratic pop culture references. None of the jokes or ""points"" of the narrative really add up to much significant. The more over-the-top moments in the film tend to rely on shock value just for the sake of it, unlike the better R-rated comedies that balance wit, irony, and strong writing with over-the-top content.One of the film's biggest problems is its characterization. The film's two lead characters are far too ""on the nose"" to the point that it becomes difficult to even remotely suspend one's disbelief. This makes the characters more annoying than funny or amusing. The film's supporting characters are also embarrassingly written as their characterization is both paper-thin and of little prominence to the greater story arc as a whole. The actions of these poorly depicted characters end up serving as glaring clichés. While the film's (surprisingly intense) action is generally well-choreographed, that is the only thing recommendable about this otherwise disastrous action-comedy. Even though Stu wants to earn a five-star rating in this movie, the film itself is only deserving of 1 star. 2/10",Stuber
99,tailsofthewind,Yes! This is what I've been wanting to see more of in TV and movies!,10,2 November 2021,"This movie worked perfectly in many interesting scenes but started off well with casting. I appreciate the fact that the two main characters are neither white, which is Hollywood's go-to race, nor even Black, which although trailing Caucasians in cinema, they have a powerhouse force in movie-making that still rivals other races and/or cultures. This needs to be done more often.The other wonderful casting surprise is the idea of using newer actors. Bautista is brilliant, funny and memorable, along with the cameo actor from his Guardians movies...well done! But the actor who plays the title roll of STUBER, although he is an experienced actor, I only recognize him from one of BOB'S BURGERS best episodes! I wish him a long, happy life in front of the camera!Many current go to actors need to be retired bc I'm tired of seeing them show up again and again, even when there's so many fresh faces out there.

101,eelen-seth,An uninspired slog from start to finish,2,9 July 2019,"Dolph Lundgren and Sarah Connor-jokes aside, Stuber is nothing more than a rehash of Schwarzenegger action comedies we've seen in the '90s. Formula filmmaking you can predict before it even happens, with violence that tries to shock but mostly just interrupts whatever is really going on on screen.The film already starts in the worst way possible, shakycam. Because everyone loves this so much, they'll use this in almost every action scene to make sure you get a headache while watching this and forget about the awful jokes. L.A.P.D. partners Vic (Dave Bautista) and Sarah (Karen Gillan), who also seem to be great friends, are discussing if Vic's grown daughter (Natalie Morales) is having anal sex, while chasing Oka Teijo (Iko Uwais), a drug dealer. After an unfortunate conclusion to this chase, everything suddenly becomes more personal for Vic.Kumail Nanjiani plays Stu. Who drives an Uber after work. That's where the title comes from *sigh*. Anyway, he works a day job in some sort of Walmart where his childish boss loves to treat him like a punching bag. Stu is also starting a small business with his best friend Becca (Betty Gilpin), who he has had a crush on since college, but doesn't have the balls to tell her and so he joins her dream to start a spin-cycle business, called Spinster, to underline his feminine side to audiences even more. When picking up Vic, who's just had laser surgery and crashed his car while in pursuit of Teijo, the duo goes on a drive around Los Angeles, visiting male strip clubs - because a large penis is still the gag of the century - and stereotypical gang hideouts filled with Latino gangsters in a suburban part of the city. And the most unbelievable part of it all, Stu is going along with all of this because he's so desperate for a perfect rating from his clearly demented passenger.Stu cries over not being able to get his longtime crush Becca's attention. Lots of people in my half full screening, found his overacted ASMR-voice and screaming the funniest thing ever, while I just got more and more annoyed at it. Stu is also opposed to violence. On the other hand, we get Vic, the hypermasculine, clumsy cop who bumps into everything that's on his path because of his fading eyesight. This attempt for laughs gets old very fast. But as things go, coupling these two very different men, is apparently the best thing they could think of while writing the script.Watching a cast, who has been doing fine for the last couple of years - both critically and commercially, acting this poorly is a serious slap in the face. The way they deliver scriptwriter Trippy Clancy's lines, is both unfunny and probably read a lot better on paper than translating it to the big screen. I hope they get back to what they were doing with their careers, and stop paying attention to car crashes like this.As buddy-movies go, Stu and Vic get to know each other better and start to get along in their own quirky ways, with Vic embracing his sensitive side and Stu realising that it's okay to be ultra-violent when showing off your masculinity.Michael Dowse's Uber commercial Stuber is an uninspired slog from the very first scene. The entire film feels out of date by at least a decade. Who knew physical comedy was still a thing in 2019? If you're still holding on to Jim Carrey's career from the '90s (don't get me wrong, I grew up with his films and loved them - but that sort of comedy died with his career - until he reinvented himself), then you'll love everything Stuber delivers for 90 minutes. For me, this was like dying and being stuck in purgatory. Ironically, I'd give Stu one star on Uber, just like I'm doing with this film.",Stuber

105,cadillac20,A Completely Forgettable Action/Comedy With One Dimensional Performances From Actors Who Deserve Better,4,22 July 2019,"Stuber is that unsurprising action-comedy you've come to expect. It's a fairly harmless movie featuring actors we know, but aren't overly familiar with, but are servicable enough to play the leads in what amounts to a fairly middling film. This is the kind of movie we might have expected to see in theaters earlier in the 2000's, but now comes across as something you'd expect more on Netflix. With a script that elicits chuckles more than laughs and some wanting performances from it's leads, this is the kind of comedy that one might see if they're bored on a weekend afternoon and need to kill some time.Stu, as cranked up to 10 by Kumail Nanjiani, is the kind of guy we've come to know over years in these kind of comedies. Aimless in life, pining for the love of his life who he is waiting for as opposed to going after, and a push over to the younger, dimwitted, abusive manager at a job he hates for a sporting good store, this is exactly the kind of character we expect to see as a lead for this kind of movie. Fulfilling the dominant co-lead archetype is Bautista's alpha cop, Vic, who has his own issues in his obsession for bad guy Tedjo, played by a very game and entertaining Iko Kuwais, which has very nearly cost him his relationship with his daughter. Creatively forced to get a ride through Uber, Vic essentially kidnaps Stu and forces him on a buddy-cop journey through LA. The premise works better than it really should have, though within the first 30 minutes, it becomes apparent just how dimwitted the match up is. Stu being so spineless that he basically allows the overly aggressive and angry Vic kidnap him comes across as little more than an excuse to keep these two together. Sadly, neither Bautista, nor Kumail ever really feel like guys you want to follow. Now, I like these two, Kumail is great in Silicon Valley and Bautista proved himself capable of being a star in Guardians, but here they are their worst stereotypes. Stu is incessantly spineless, constantly whining without ever actually doing anything (like, oh, I don't know, calling the LAPD to complain that one of their own has kidnapped someone), and Vic is an alpha who constantly angry and makes decisions as a cop that seem archaic by about a decade.The movie has some mildly amusing scenes and fairs better in the action department than I expected, but it's so laden with cliches, I am hard pressed to care. The best comedies today surprise or feel genuine. We can relate to the characters we're seeing on screen and accept even ridiculous, grand adventures they may go on. You can turn to Apatow or David Gordon Green or Adam McKay. These guys have all delivered similar comedies with similar characters, but they make their leads feel like more than just typical movie cliches cranked up. By the time our leads predictably grow and change for the better, we just don't care. We've seen it before and it's not entertaining. But again, this is a harmless movie. It doesn't really offend or do anything risky enough to turn off viewers. Some may be turned off by it's more modern sensibilities and attempts at deconstructing alpha masculinity. But these things are so insignificant in a movie that doesn't really matter anyway, I can't imagine anyone but the most triggered of people to look that deeply at it.In a summer that has, at times, felt lazy, and at others been very entertaining and engaging, this movie feels like the former. I imagine it was fun for it's leads, who don't get to lead a major film too often, and hopefully it will get them more lead roles in major films in the future, but here they're just way too engaged in this material and too one dimensional to make the film memorable. This will be a rental for most, and a forgettable one at that.",Stuber

113,C-Younkin,Nanjiani sells it well enough,6,20 July 2019,"5 Stars. No, not really.Stuber follows a cop played by Dave Bautista whose big moment in his pursuit of a big time drug dealer coincides with a recent eye surgery so he commandeers uber driver Kumail Nanjiani.And Nanjiani is a genuinely funny comedic actor. He's great in Silicon Valley, The Big Sick, without him Men in Black International wouldn't even be able to claim its a comedy.his nerdy-beta male charisma is often enough to get some laughs here, his reactions are without question funnier than most of what he's given to do.The movie is going for an old fashioned 48 Hours kind of thing with Bautista playing the weathered cop and Nanjiani the motor mouth who gets under his skin.Bautista plays Nick Nolte very well- he captures the dogged determination, the groggy delivery, the poor personal connections well.He's the kind of guy who has a chip on his shoulder from losing multiple partners.Nanjiani is the kind of guy who not only won't shut up but also he's consistently friend zoned by a best friend.A lot of this is well worn and the actual plot is a real drag but it actually finds more random laughs than I expected- a scene where Nanjiani gets life coaching from a male stripper for one and a talk/fight between he and Bautista that's one of the funnier things i've seen this year.Funniest is how Bautista said he would never do a Fast and Furious movie yet everything here from the car chases, shootouts, fights is sort of the same thing yet most of these things always look much smarter in FF movies.But thanks to the two stars and a fast pace Stuber is more amusing than it has any right to be.",Stuber

123,helenbassett,Stuber Film Review - Michael Dowse Directs Kumail Nanjiani Driving An Uber Electric Prius And Doing Anything For A 5 Star Rating From Dave Bautista,8,29 July 2019,"Kumail Nanjiani prowls the mean streets of Los Angeles in an leased electric Prius looking for five star ratings on his Uber account, offering refreshments and music to your taste, and driving to save enough money to help his would be girlfriend open a spin studio. Getting drunker by the minute, Betty Gilpin has Stu on a leash, continually abusing his good nature and trying to hook up with celebs right under his nose. Michael Dowse directs the Stuber fun but it's a thankless task for Stu who is so gentle, or Stuber, as his boss, played by Jimmy Tatro, calls him. But he's very loyal and always uses Stu's Uber.One day Stu gets a call from Dave Bautista's LAPD detective Vic, still searching to put away the drug criminal who killed his partner. A short role for Karen Gillan. But Vic has had a tip off that Iko Uwais's Tedjo is moving a drug shipment. He's good at martial arts! Problem is Vic's just had laser eye surgery and cannot see, so he needs a driver. To be fair he has a go at driving himself which is a laugh. But finally he gives in and calls the Uber number his artist daughter, Natalie Morales, left on his phone.So our odd couple reluctantly team up as buddies because Stu needs his promised 5 stars, and Vic wants to catch his man. Who knew Uber driving could be such hellish fun. Along the way we check into a male strip joint with Stu pouring out his romantic problems to a stripper. Those guys are lovely. And it's straight on to Compton where our mild mannered Uber driver inadvertently shoots a villain, but don't worry Vic knows a vet who can patch him up. And he can look after the dog that the criminals stuffed full of drug evidence. Vic was more angry about the dog. See he has a soft spot under that gruff exterior. And the ensuing shootout is one of the many set pieces of the movie.With the heavy product placement to be honest I wasn't expecting much from the slight mid summer comedy, but Stubert was very good. A love story going nowhere for Stu, a career going nowhere and a part time job where he literally goes anywhere you tell him. And Vic does. Even Stu's boss turns out to be not quite the dick he acts. And I hadn't expected Mina Sorvino to be quite the hard ass as Vic's LAPD boss, but Stu is quiet and deadly, and his true love comes in the almost predictable matching Christmas sweaters, à la Bridget Jones.Michael Dowse directs a lot of movie bang for your buck over the 93 minutes; laugh out loud comedy, crime, action, love and having the courage to express our inner feelings. With Kumail Nanjiani and Dave Bautista giving it their all. And Christmas in July is always funny. Although you have to feel sorry for the real Uber drivers if Stu's driving montage is anywhere near realistic.",Stuber
124,PerryAtTheMovies,"A fun, not to be taken serious, movie....",6,24 January 2021,"Initial Thoughts:
Today was my second, or third, time watching ""Stuber"" over the last year. I've maintained enough time between viewings to forget the details moment by moment and each time I've concluded that this film is worth no more and no less than a 6/10 rating.It's a fun film that goes over the top, but by no means is meant to be taken seriously. I have laughed out loud while watching this movie on multiple occasions, and even only nose huffed a few times, but every time I enjoy the jokes. Dave Bautista is as fun to watch in this film as he is in ""My Spy"". I enjoy how he just smashes through everything and almost never takes a single injury. (Again, not a film to be taken seriously). Kumail Nanjiani is just as fun to watch as he has this constant panic and fear that all the way through the film as he tries to find his inner man to say ""enough is enough"", albeit, all in vain. Overall, they counterbalance each other nicely.I know I said this film shouldn't be taken seriously, but the cons to this film are the amount of bullets being shot without either hitting anyone, or just being unloaded across the room with no reloads. Although this is my one con, it does make the move flow and more exciting for what it is meant to be.Overall:
A good time waster of a film, that in my opinion, is a fun to watch. Now, I wouldn't call this a family movie, but if you're a family that old enough to watch ""R"" rated films, than I suppose it can be classified a ""family"" movie.""Should I watch this movie?"" My answer is 'yes, if you're looking for something that's funny and not meant to be serious'.Enjoy the show!",Stuber

It's not a bad movie and there are some funny jokes in it though. Kumail Nanjiani Is really the funniest one? He steals the show. He makes a lot of quips under his breath that are hilarious, and you will miss them if you are not paying attention. I thought he was hilarious in Portlandia. Batista has proven himself to be a pretty good comedic actor too. He was funny in Guardians of the Galaxy.

Bautista works hard, but the producers allowed Nanjiani to be free to improvise and speak like a machine gun and that makes him absolutely unpalatable. If I were the policeman played by Bautista, I would have quickly beat Nanjiani and sent him home or to the hospital.

They have proven that they are great sidekicks and supporting actors-however, here, they fail to command the screen. The comedic moments fall flat and, more often than not, you can guess where they are going with a joke. It isn't very fresh humor. You can tell the director often had the actors riff during comedic moments-however it comes across as comedians riffing and as such it doesn't seem as funny. This movie is like a Batman movie with two Robins and no Batman.The storyline is a recycled ""buddy cop action comedy"" story-the characters are generic-and they tend to get a little too preachy with the ""it is 2019 it's okay for Men to cry"" message.It passed the time, but I wouldn't recommend it or watch it again.",Stuber

152,thetyvonlesure,Average Comedy with a Predictable Plot,5,13 July 2019,"Stuber is a buddy cop comedy movie of old, repurposed for the modern Zeitgeist. It is an action-comedy hybrid that takes itself serious at times, but contradicts its serious intentions by the end of the film. The film establishes ramifications that are dissolved by the film's close. The comedy isn't all that funny. There are minor portions worth chuckling at. The film plays itself more serious than not, yet the comedy seemed to feel more important to the filmmakers. The action was average and poorly shot. The camera wobbles too much during these action sequences, presenting a chaotic feel with an annoying presentation. This film is not subtle at all, with any of its' message. The film overdoes it's commentary on toxic masculinity, making Dave Bautista's character look incredibly dumb, while simultaneously having him do all of the work. Kumail Nanjiani's character was written to be incredibly annoying and overbearing, yet he's framed as the golden son of the film. The movie is a fun and straight to the point, despite it's flaws. Bautista and Kumail have great chemistry and do a good job of playing off each other. Bautista is coming into his own as an actor. Overall, Stuber is a buddy cop comedy that'll likely be forgotten over time, with the finished product lacking comedic prowess.",Stuber

It feels like they wrote the script just around Kumail Nanjiani, and added the most cliched plot, to give you the minimum expectations of a buddy cop film.Let's start with the bad,cause I'd want to end on a positive note. Nothing in this story works - from the first scene, you can tell that the director is not too familiar with camera work; shaky cams,overly drawn out scenes, and stupid characters are rampant during the runtime. Dave Bautista's character is by far the dumbest movie character I have seen in a while; so arrogant,yet small minded,I'm amazed he plays a cop. A cop like this in the real world would be dead in 3 minutes. I mean, Uber has more character in this movie than Bautista. Product placement is literally once every 3 minutes.Everything else is incredibly cliched - the villains monologue, cars explode, impossible trick shots, fight and make up moments. This film also had no idea what tone it wanted to establish- it starts out being very real,and then turns into an obvious buddy-cop scenario,and then tries to be real again; pick a lane and stick to it! The plot is mundane and boring- characters have no reasons to do what they do.What really go me through this is Kumail Nanjiani. If you like his humor and nature, you'll enjoy the time he's on screen. Every moment we transitioned to another character,I was thinking, let's go back to Kumail. He's got funny dialogue, witty humor and expected, but acceptable character growth.I wouldn't recommend this 90 minute Uber commercial for the big screen,but if you find it on a streaming service, it's good for background comedy.",Stuber

Meek, mild-mannered Stu (Kumail Nanjiani), one of the two main characters of this movie, drives his leased electric car for Uber at nights and on his days off from his job at a sporting goods store. The title comes from a joke spoken by Stu's jerk of a boss (Jimmy Tatro). One day Stu picks up a rider (Dave Bautista), the other main character, who is far more than he bargained for. Bautista plays Vic, a macho cop whose partner (Karen Gillan) was killed about six months previously. The prime suspect, a drug-dealing martial artist named Oka Tedjo (Iko Uwais), has disappeared, but Vic finally receives a tip concerning his whereabouts. Unfortunately, this occurred right after Vic has Lasik surgery and can barely see, let alone drive. Consequently, he has to take an Uber and Vic has the misfortune to be the driver who takes the call. They have a series of adventures, including a visit to a male strip club, and both of them have relationship problems: Stu is in love with Becca (Betty Gilpin) who only thinks of him as a friend, and Vic has pursued his career at the expense of his relationship with his daughter Nicole (Natalie Morales). Reviewers have not been kind to this movie, but both Anita and I laughed frequently.

You'll find better jokes on the back of cereal boxes or wrapped around a piece of chewing gum.The story is weak, the comedy is dead on arrival, and the only things keeping it from being completely worthless are that it's at least competently shot and edited -- though rather unimaginatively -- and Bautista, as mentioned, sure is trying his best!

However as you continue watching, the jokes become repetitive and with an inappropriate timing. Could not feel that there's chemistry (or at least it was weak) between the main actors Kumail Nanjiani and Dave Bautista as one of the was really a coward who mans ups in the very end of the movie (very typical) and the other is a tough cop who only focuses on catching his target and becomes careless to his daughter.
Overall I recommend watching the movie but do not expect too much from it, it's good to pass time.",Stuber

I think he is a decent comedian. But somewhere in this 'opposites-pair-up-to-save-the-day-buddy-comedy/action' pic, their positives don't feed into each other and instead of 1+1 =2 we get 1+1 = 1.5.... maybe? For me, it takes way too long for them to bond and form the grateful friend relationship that is obviously coming. Instead, we're left with a lot of screen time of them being just plain annoying. And not in a funny way, more in the pretentious way that makes you not want to root for them.There are still a few laughs, and the best parts of this movie are when they let go and stop trying to make a serious crooked cop movie and just let the absurdity of the plot play out.",Stuber

Saw Stuber with a group of friends in the theater and we were laughing uncontrollably for most of the film. It was one of, if not the funniest movie of 2019.Bautista and Nanjiani formed an unorthodox buddy cop duo that played surprisingly well on screen. Bautista carried a lot of his Drax personsa into his character and Nanjiani is one of those rare actors who is just naturally funny with perfect comedic delivery.Don't expect to be blown away by the story or the depth of the characters.

To my great surprise Stuber was wonderful! It's funny, heartwarming, it has adventure, love, redemption and it has a wonderful message about the meaning of being a man...or human. It was also hilarious, and just what I needed! I plan on seeing it again actually, because I liked it that much!

203,arskhemnanilack,Stuber - 6/10,6,22 July 2019,"I walked into this movie with pretty low expectations, thinking it would be an unfunny cop movie with bad CGI and a story that is completely irrelevant and goes nowhere. Thankfully, only one of those things are true. Firstly with the humor, it seemed to have landed for the most part and was hilarious. The jokes weren't too far fetched and only a few scenes were sacrificed for a joke. About the CGI, I did not notice a single use of CGI, with all the effects seeming to be practical and it looks great for the most part. Dave Bautista and Kumail Nanjiani did an incredible job with their roles in this movie, and they were easily the best part of the movie, keeping me through the disappointing story with their jokes and acting. Though like I said, one of those things were true and it was the story not quite going anywhere and feeling rather irrelevant because if lacks much substance or importance. The one part of the story that I do like are how the two main characters share a huge contrast and they're almost exact opposite of each other. Although it just felt like they really were not going anywhere with the story and just visiting a bunch of random places to get information that takes them to the next place continuously until they find the one place with what they're looking for. The villain in this plot also is completely weak, and barely feels like he has any relevance or much of a threat to the main characters. Some things that happen in the story towards the end feels dumb and rushed into the story just to give some of the side characters purpose. Although the plot was disappointingly weak, I still had a great time with this movie and would definitely check it out for a fun time in the theater. Iko Uwais is also in this movie a lot more than I expected, but plays easily the worst character in the movie and feels a lot like a drag to the story.",Stuber
204,nogu-06346,One joke movie.,1,3 April 2020,"At an hour and a half the movie is too short. They mostly do this to make the movie seem quick-witted. But, it falls short of explaining peoples back stories and you asked the question am I missing something. And when any parts of the story comes up you don't care because you didn't have enough time to spend with the characters. Oh yeah, there's a twist in this movie that only gets brought up once. This is one of the main reasons why I think this movie isn't worth much.The action isn't realistic. People can break out car windows with their legs. People can just get up after having a boat oar hit over them multiple times.And the ending is the biggest joke of the movie. Throwing dumb story plots at the wall and seeing what sticks.After watching this movie I can see what's happening the 20th Century Fox is right in front of them. Because, the studio cannot survive on making movies about people learning to cut loose. At the end of the day just turns into a background noise movie. And these are the lessons that similar studios like Paramount and Sony need to learn. Or they might find a similar fate.",Stuber

This was as far off base as Let's Be Cops. There is literally no chemistry between Vic and Stuber. They establish zero commonground, they have literally nothing in common, they only become friends out of convenience and survival but no other reasons as they never have any laughs together or anything. Worst of all they both are way too unlikable to care about. They are just 2 one-dimensional odd couple cliche partners.Overall, this movie is pointless, has lame villains, has lame, one-dimensional and decidedly unlikable heroes with zero chemistry of any kind, the humor is way too violent, corny, childish, and mean-spirited, the only good performance was by Dave Bautista and everyone else was terrible, they dust off just about every cop movie cliche that is humanly possible and not in a clever way either....Also the action scenes are both bland and fake looking.",Stuber

212,maxwelloreocookie,Not as bad as most say.,8,17 July 2019,"I thought this was a very entertaining and funny movie, and that's all it has to be for a movie like this. I really don't get the hate. It seems most people I talk to in real life like or love this movie, but most reviews and comments I see on the internet hate this movie. Weird.The cop plot is cliche but that doesn't matter, cuz just like Rush Hour, the movie is about the comedy, action, adventure, and chemistry between the 2 leads. This isn't as good or classic as Rush Hour, but still a great time and worth a theatre ticket to see with friends.I don't get why so many critic reviews and IMDB reviews are so bad for this movie. Am I missing something? The majority of my theatre was constantly laughing and left extremely pleased and happy. It's just a nice little fun feel good movie and it does it very well. Stuber is way better than these other new buddy unfunny forced comedies like Ride Along(ugh!), Central Intelligence, etc. I didn't like this movies at all. Stuber is way better. It's not an Oscar movie. Judge it for what it is and what it's trying to be.For me, the best buddy cop movie is the original Rush Hour, that's a 10/10 for the buddy cop genre. Stuber is not that far behind. Maybe I'm just immature, but I found myself smiling and laughing at this movie way more than expected.I also enjoyed Stu's sideplot more than Vic's main plot, which is a cop cliche plot, but is good enough for this type of movie. Basically, Stu's sideplot takes a unique take on the nice guy gets the girl plot, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. The chemistry between Vic and Stu was actually quite good. They are 2 polar opposites who bounce off eachother as expected, opposites usually make the funniest pairing, that's usually how this buddy cop movies work, and for me, it delivered here. Also the emotional scenes between them didn't feel forced and actually quite touching.My only minor problem is Iko Uwais plays the main villian in the movie, and he was badass in The Raid movies, but he isn't given much to do here.",Stuber

234,beavis_el_bunghole,A feminist buddy cop film starring almost 2 men,3,25 April 2020,"So much stupidity. Some good lines and reasonable chemistry, but the constant improvisational babbling and shouting and whining (it truly never ends and too much of it is clearly not scripted or contextually appropriate or even funny) of preposterous insecurity by Stu just gets on your nerves and never ends. And, most of the time, it isnt clever or witty, either; it is just there to fulfill the cliche and rambles on like a bad night at an improv comedy night.The premise runs very thin after the first or second uber stop with a blind guy who is supposed to be a good cop stumbling around like a moron oger for 95% of the film.The shootouts and fight scenes are scripted poorly as well, with one thinking it is funny to stage a gunfight in crummy vet office in broad daylight with sunlight streaming through the windows, but then throwing dog food at the numerous lights in order to somehow make it dark in the room. It makes no logical sense at all.But, what was the final nail in the proverbial coffin is the final battle ending; Stu is supposed to become a man and stop being a frail whimpering cowering idiot, but in the end, the film hammers you over the head to suggest that being Stu--who doesnt really change much in the end--is what will get you a good woman and that you shouldn't ever kill people even if they murder everyone, including people you know, and try desperately to kill you and your family and sell heroin to teenagers and infiltrate the police force. The good cop is just a tough guy alone with his dog who was bitter cause his dad was jerk. The balance between all the characters just isnt there because the arcs in their writing are not inspiring or true to life.Also, Mira isnt in it nearly enough.So, though, they are both likeable, there are much better buddy cop films.",Stuber

260,maceyrr,Funnier than I expected,7,28 June 2019,"Watching the trailer, it seems like an interesting movie about the an uber driver being kidnapped by a cop on his hunt for the killer of his former partner. I had some reservations but figured that I should still go and see the screener. I have to say that it was better than I expected. However, after saying that, and even though the movie is about an hour and half long, much shorter than the extremely, unnecessarily drawn out movies nowadays, I still found this movie could have been better had it been even shorter.Both Kumail Nanjiani (Stu the Uber driver) and Dave Bautista (Vic) were pretty good. I find that although both characters are very different, they did seem to work well in this film because the jokes that focused on their personalities and culture did work, although the obvious one about mistaking Bautista as a whole list of different races including Chinese was a bit of a stretch. But most of the jokes did work well because they focused on the cultural differences and usual stereotypes but it wasn't in bad taste which typically, most jokes that touch on them can be.The plot of the story really centered on Vic's obsessive manhunt for the killer of his former partner. The movie basically showed his leads to his man with a lot of fighting, shooting, blood splattering everywhere, heads getting busted, that sort of stuff. Stu ends up being an unwilling helper for Vic as he drives them around in search for Teijo, the cop killer. The action scenes are pretty good, although a lot of them are very hard to watch not because of the violence but the camera seems to unnecessarily shake way too much that I got sick watching. I'm guessing the whole point of these blurry scenes is to give the audience of how Vic sees the world without his glasses and how he is practically blind but I think if most of the action scenes are like this, you are turning away a lot of the viewers who don't want to watch because it's making them sick.What I enjoyed were the scenes where they show Stu dealing with the shock of witnessing all these murders happening in front of him, watching people's brains getting blown off and trying to deal with it. That was something that seemed to be genuine in terms of how a regular civilian would react to such intense, stressful moments.After all this, I am trying to figure out what this movie is trying to be, an action movie or a comedy? I think they are trying to make this into an action comedy, but more of an action than comedy. In this case, it does work but it still feels awkward. Are we supposed to laugh when someone's brains get blown off when it really shouldn't be a laughing matter? It seems strange. Yes, there are many funny moments but like I said, it seems awkward to raise comedy during such violent scenes. It almost makes it seem okay.What I found was a time waster was the scene when Vic and Stu had their big brawl. What was that all about? Yes, I see the reason but does this scene really need to be there? Yes, it's their ""bonding"" moment but still...Considering that I wasn't expecting much, I did end up enjoying it more than expected. Don't expect this movie to be too complicated with much of any twist. Just enjoy the ride.",Stuber
261,momscannoli,This might the worst movie I've ever watched.,1,27 March 2020,"The lack of originality in this movie is litterally breathtaking.

267,sevendoc23,Predictable in many of the right ways,6,13 January 2020,"Stuber will certainly not gonna go down as a comedy classic however it still managed to be a fun buddy film. The film itself is shot like your typical summer comedy with a few scenes that look straight out of a YouTube video but the chemistry between Bautista and Nanjiani manage to pull a few laughs and ultimately allows the movie to avoid being another ""C.H.I.P.S ."" It's predictable; borrowing heavily from many other similar comedies but the film itself isn't trying to be subtle and never takes itself too seriously allowing the plot and the actors to really have fun with their roles and you can see it in the performance. Speaking of the plot, it's your basic violent buddy cop movie but with the good cop being replaced by an insecure and witty Uber driver (played by Nanjiani). There are some over the top scenes and quite a bit of violence along with most of the jokes consisting of lowbrow humor but it makes for an enjoyable movie.",Stuber

I hardly know where to begin in describing its badness. It's in a category of its own, really. Brutal, absurd, unfunny, and tasteless, its lack of any redeeming qualities is matched only by the cravenness of the people who made it. Imagine every cop movie cliche: death of a partner, neglected and resentful daughter, a case that's being ""kicked up to the Feds,"" a big score that's ""going down"" right when the cop is supposed to be at his kid's big art show, a crooked cop, and on and on. Then add massive gunfights with plenty of heads spurting blood, a death in the first five minutes of a character meant only to give the cop another reason to be on the case. Give the cop LASIK surgery so he has to stumble around and use Uber. Add ""jokes"" that are as limp as cooked spaghetti and as dated as The Terminator and Sade (both in actual use here) plus the ongoing humiliation of Kumail Nadjani's Uber-driving character as well as of the actor, and you get a movie that almost literally made me sick. The only thing worse was hearing so many people in the audience laughing at the violence and not at the jokes. Some movies you just don't like; some, like this one, are objectively bad. Bad in their conception, bad in their execution, bad in their spirit. Even though we saw it for free I feel like 20th Century Fox owes me at least $15.00 and an apology. Revolting.",Stuber

Nanjiani is an established comedian and Bautista is showing once again that he has range as an actor. The chemistry of the two turns out to be quite entertaining and at times chuckle-worthy.You will notice some inconsistent facial hair on Bautista though; as he has very little beard in one scene but he has a full beard a few minutes later, and then back to the stubble it is in the next minute ... For some reason they decided to not re-shoot those scenes to avoid the continuity problem. Something we should look at the movie's director for.The body of the plot can accurately be summarized in a single line you saw in the IMDB page: ""Cop recruits Uber driver for a night of adventure.""

I have not been in a theater full of people who laughed out loud...really loud for most of a movie in a very long time.
Dave and Kumail have great chemistry and their bickering provides some of the funnier moments. The action scenes are also hilarious due to the earlier mentioned plot device I will not reveal.
I think where this movie falls down is in main thread of the plot...cop wanting revenge. It gets too serious at times. I found myself asking ""when's the next comedy bit?"" And that is not good...It should flow from bit to bit without the serious detours.
This can wait to be seen at home but do see it.",Stuber

426,omer-11299,good movie,10,23 July 2019,Very good and entertaining film from start to finish,Stuber
427,handfordnathan,Fun Buddy Comedy Flick,8,21 July 2019,The action was as good as the comedy and reminded me alot of the Rush Hour movies. Dave Batista proves he has some acting chops and plays off of his co-stat very well.,Stuber
428,jarooojarooo,Not worth it,2,16 July 2019,"I was really excited to see this movie. I love Nanjiani and Bautista, I was gonna have fun. An then the movie happened.
From the first scene it's just bad. The action is meh, the comedy is ugh. Starts with cliches and poor excuses for jokes then gradually becomes just boring with awkward incel/friendzone jokes on the side.
I'm really disappointed. I'd rather spend these two hours at the dentist's office.
I gave it 2 stars, because it had dogs in it. That's the only nice thing about this movie.",Stuber

430,craigwlove,Fun and Funny,9,30 June 2019,"I was lucky enough to score a ticket to see a preview screening of the movie before its official opening. Both lead stars really fit the role and worked well together. Some of the pop culture references (the ones you ""get"") were really funny (I especially laughed at the Terminator related reference). Overall, it was a very entertaining and fun/funny movie from beginning to end. Recommended for a date night.",Stuber
431,dnarlycl-95596,Hilarious,10,27 June 2019,I laughed the whole time! Great movie! Definitely a five star rating!!!,Stuber
432,takussa,Only if you like and know them.,10,17 July 2019,Funny and entertaining. Looking for a sequel. They are still on that level of their comedic style. Not selling out light joke like will ferrells semi pro or daddys home or the jail movie with kevin hart.,Stuber
433,vanyalorient,"10% LMAO 90% ""huh?""",5,28 July 2019,"Watched it with my crush and the only thing that made me laugh was his laughters. I know right, he has that bad sense of humor. But thanks cuz finally I have a bf.",Stuber
434,gvarhely-31196,See it quick as it won't be around for long,1,15 July 2019,Worst film I have seen all year. Kumail is a great writer and comedian but can not hold a film by himself. David Bautista....you need some one in that role that you can care about and root for and that is not him. Isn't this the same movie from a few years ago with Jimmy Fallon and Queen Latifa where she was a taxi driver??? Wasn't funny then and is not funny now.,Stuber
435,isabel-96326,Better than I expected,9,11 November 2019,"I don't really get why people are being so hard on it. Sure, it's kind of a cliche type film. But, I really thought there were some good heartfelt scenes and I thought the comedy was pretty good. I laughed a lot throughout this movie. The two leads worked really well together, and I thought the comedic contrast between their characters and their personalities made this movie much better. The reviews are pretty harsh, it was a really good movie. Would watch again.",Stuber
