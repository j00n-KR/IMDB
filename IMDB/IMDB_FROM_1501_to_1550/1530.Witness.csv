0,MartinHafer,Well worth seeing--unless you can't see it because of your religious values!,8,13 July 2012,"I am certainly no expert on the Amish (a name give which covers Old Order Mennonites, Conservative Mennonites, Hutterites, and Old German Baptist Brethren ) and I am sure this film would have bothered many of them had they been able to watch it--though the Amish, especially, would shun such modern contrivances as movies. The film was violent and showed a woman whose convictions suddenly vanished because of raging hormones--surely this might offend a few. I doubt if minor details would have offended (such as all the sexy Quaker guys had no beards!). But, despite these difficulties, Peter Weir did manage to direct a very compelling film.The plot is very believable. I have spent tons of time in Philadelphia, so seeing the Amish walking about (especially at Reading Market downtown) is believable (these are generally the more liberal-minded Amish). And, a scene where a guy is brutally stabbed in a bathroom is very believable for Philly (I've personally witnessed 6 or 7 only this year alone). I am not sure, however, how much the Philadelphia Police Department appreciated the film, as it said that they were run by a group of evil racketeers.An Amish woman (Kelly McGillis) takes her son on a train trip to Baltimore to see her sister. However, at the train station, the boy just happens to be in the bathroom where a cold-blooded murder of an undercover cop occurs. The boy is smart, however, and hides---and manages to be the only witness to the slaying. When the police investigate, the Captain (Harrison Ford) takes the case personally (is this realistic?) and uses the kid to try to track down one of the killers who he can identify. However, when it turns out that the killer is a police lieutenant (Danny Glover), there is a problem--as the problem turns out to be a lot bigger and the Chief is clearly part of a much deeper conspiracy. So what is Ford to do now that he realizes that he and the boy are both about to be killed to protect this criminal empire? Yep, he and the kid and the hot mom head back to Lancaster County--to the so-called 'Amish Country' to hide out among the good, honest folk.The film gets kudos for very good acting, a nicely relaxed film style and a great story with a very exciting ending. Even with the gratuitous scenes of McGillis' breasts (again, had the Amish been able to see the film, they would NOT have been amused), it is a case of excellent story-telling. Compelling throughout and it works best for me because of how they ended the thing--without a cop-out perfect ending like you'd expect from many Hollywood productions.",Witness
1,bkoganbing,The Terrible English World,9,27 June 2008,"When Harrison Ford is not playing Han Solo, Indiana Jones, or Jack Ryan he's done some other really outstanding films and Witness certainly ranks among the best. It's a wonderful drama about two worlds meeting over a homicide.The film is seen through the eyes of its title character, young Lukas Haas who plays the Witness to a homicide. And it isn't some ordinary street crime either. While traveling to Baltimore from Amish country with his mother, Kelly McGillis, the little boy goes to the men's room in the 30th Street station in Philadelphia. There he witnesses two men kill an undercover Philly cop. But there's a whole lot more to it than that, the story involves police corruption at the highest levels in the Philadelphia, PD. When Ford tries to shield McGillis and Haas, they are found out and Ford is nearly killed. He decides they are safer indeed back in their neighborhood where outsiders would really stand out.It's quite a change for Ford as he adapts into the Amish world. And of course there's a growing attraction between Ford and McGillis.Witness succeeds on every level it operates on, as a police drama, as a romance, as a thriller. The movie was shot in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania in the actual Amish country and in Philadelphia.Witness was nominated for several Oscars including Best Picture, Best Actor for Harrison Ford, and Best Director for Peter Weir. It did win for Film Editing and for Original Screenplay. Original it is because I don't think the Pennsylvania Amish were ever the subject of a motion picture before.You will also like Danny Glover and Josef Sommer as a pair of corrupt Philadelphia ranking police officials and Viggo Mortenson has a role as an Amish suitor for Kelly McGillis. McGillis herself loses the glamor for her part. Hard to believ the sexy flight instructor in Top Gun is the same woman.Though Ford got the nomination in the acting category, the film really belongs to Lukas Haas. With minimal dialog and a set of expressions on his young face that conveys all, it's one of the best juvenile performances ever filmed.Witness should not be missed, rent, tape it, buy the VHS or DVD, but definitely see this film.",Witness
2,Leofwine_draca,Poignant and unexpectedly moving,9,17 April 2011,"One of the most underrated films of the 1980s, WITNESS is a heartfelt exploration of America's Amish community. The Amish are a Christian group who shun modern-day technology in favour of a simple life. Into their midst is thrown Harrison Ford, a tough city cop who must learn to cope with their insular society.The thriller aspects, while wonderfully handled, come second to the film's exploration of Amish culture. Peter Weir is at his best here, directing some sublime scenes (who can forget the barn raising sequence?) and eliciting strong performances from his entire cast. Ford is fine, but it's Kelly McGillis and particularly Lukas Haas who shine as the god-fearing folk who find themselves propelled into a world of violence and the unknown.Pretty much everything you could want from a good film.",Witness
3,SnoopyStyle,great crime drama and clash of cultures,8,21 March 2015,"Rachel Lapp (Kelly McGillis) recently lost her husband. She and her son Samuel (Lukas Haas) are traveling from Pennsylvania by train to visit her sister in Baltimore. While waiting for a transfer, Samuel witnesses a murder at the Philadelphia train station bathroom. The victim is a policeman. Det. John Book (Harrison Ford) hounds Samuel for an ID. At the police station, he recognizes James McFee (Danny Glover)'s picture as one of the two killers but he's a police lieutenant. Book tells Chief Paul Schaeffer (Josef Sommer) but he's in on the corruption. McFee shots Book. He drives them back to their home to hide. He passes out as he's leaving the Lapp home.Director Peter Weir infuses this with tension. The main actors are all terrific. The clash of cultures is compelling and handled well. It's well written. The crime drama is tightly wound like a great coil readying to spring.",Witness
4,Prismark10,Witness,9,28 March 2020,"It is surprising to think just how big a thriller Witness was when it was released back in 1985. It was nominated for the Best Picture Oscar and Harrison Ford got a Best Actor nomination.It starts out as and ends as a violent thriller. An Amish boy Samuel (Lukas Haas) sees a man being brutally killed in the men's room of a train station. The killer turns out to be a detective.Detective John Book (Harrison Ford) investigating the crime realises that he has stumbled on a conspiracy of corrupt cops.An injured Book takes Samuel and his widowed mother Rachel Lapp (Kelly McGillis) back to their Amish community in Pennsylvania.While hiding out, Book tries to blend in with the Amish. He also finds romance with Rachel but she is torn between her strict upbringing.Book arouses suspicion within the Amish community, her father Eli and her suitor Daniel.Soon the corrupt cops arrive to the remote community looking for Book and the boy.Director Peter Weir who was in the forefront of the Australian new wave cinema is not overawed in his American debut.With stirring music by Maurice Jarre, the Australian transplanted in Hollywood brings an effective viewpoint of Book being a fish out of water in the Lancaster County Amish community.Weir realises that the Amish ways would be strange to the audience so Book is the audience surrogate. The bonding between Book and the Amish takes place in the barn building scene.Even the romance between Rachel and Book is tender. The serenading with the Sam Cooke song Wonderful World was much parodied at the time.There is a lot of comedy especially between Book and Eli such as when Book tries to milk a cow. There is jealousy as Rachel's suitor Daniel, an alpha male himself is wary of Book's presence. He too is bound by his pacifist ways when a gang of hoodlums harass them and Daniel has to turn the other cheek in a key scene.The production struck lucky with the casting as well. Viggo Mortensen has a small role in his film debut. Alexander Godunov is good as Daniel, Jan Rubes is even better as Eli. Danny Glover is a surprise one of the corrupt cops.",Witness
5,claudio_carvalho,One of the Best Thrillers and Romances of the Eighties,9,7 December 2003,"Minor SpoilersRachel Lapps (Kelly McGillis) and her son Samuel (Lukas Haas, with seven years old) live in an Amish community in Philadelphia. Rachel has just lost her husband and is traveling by train to visit her sister, in Baltimore. While waiting the train, Samuel  witness a violent murder in the restroom. John Book (Harrison Ford) is the detective in charge of the investigation and brings the boy with him to the police station for identification of the criminal. John finds out that he is the  highly honored detective James McFee (Danny Glover), from the Narcotics division.  John looks for his chief and friend Paul Schaeffer (Joseph Sommer) asking for support, but he is also member of McFee`s gang. John is chased by McFee and wounded. He escapes with Rachel and Samuel to their small town  and there among the Amish, he heals, getting stronger again. Rachel and John falls in love for each other, and due to an incident, the dirty policemen find where John is hidden. This film has a great end. `Witness' is certainly one of the best thrillers / romances of the Eighties. The plot is very well developed, the actors and actresses have outstanding performances, lightning, shadows and soundtrack are wonderful and the direction is perfect. Kelly McGillis is very beautiful, even wearing the Amish costumes and without make-up. The now-a-days famous Viggo Mortensen has a minor participation, in the beginning of his career, acting as an Amish from Rachel's community. There are fantastic scenes in this movie, such as: when Rachel and her relatives receives the compliments of Daniel Hochleitner (Alexander Godunov); when Samuel witness the crime, with his frightened eyes; when Samuel identifies the picture of the murderer; when Rachel and John kiss each other; and the last silent scene, when John leaves the Rachel's house and crosses with Daniel. The soundtrack from Maurice Jarre suits perfectly to this magnificent film. My vote is none.",Witness
6,classicsoncall,"""You be careful out among them English.""",8,21 June 2018,"Take Harrison Ford out of the Star Wars and Indiana Jones franchises and he still delivers the goods. In ""Witness"", his character Captain John Book, becomes aware of a conspiracy within the ranks of his own police force, and has to fend off his department chief to save a widowed Amish woman and her young son. The film explores the clash of cultures between the Amish and an outside world that often doesn't respect their religious beliefs or the simple way they live. To the picture's credit, the story line doesn't cop out with a feel good ending in which Ford's character and the Amish woman Rachel (Kelly McGillis), wind up as a couple running off together. Neither one, against all temptation, compromises their personal beliefs and morals to take advantage of the other. Though there was that one scene in which they exchanged a passionate moment that ended with a quick cut away leaving their relationship somewhat unresolved. Fair to say that you're not likely to see another film with as ironic an ending for one of the bad guys as you have here - death by corn.",Witness
7,gavin6942,An Interesting Look At The Amish,7,23 April 2013,"A young Amish boy is sole witness to a murder; policeman John Book (Harrison Ford) goes into hiding in Amish country to protect him until the trial.First of all, I have to point out that this was the first big screen role for Viggo Mortensen. Well done, sir. Although they did not know it then, you went on to be a big man in Hollywood. Great to see you here.More importantly, how to judge this film? From an entertainment point of view, it is pretty darn good. I loved Harrison Ford, and I think this is one of Peter Weir's more ""fun"" films. I am sure more people enjoyed this than ""Picnic at Hanging Rock"" (which is probably the better film, but not a fun movie by any means).And yet, is this a fair portrayal of the Amish? Is it accurate? Is it exploitation? Were they consulted on how they would be shown here? I suppose in some sense it does not matter because the strict Amish would never see the movie, but it does not do them any favors if they are presented as being something they are not...",Witness
8,lee_eisenberg,"""Weird Al"" Yankovic must have watched this movie while writing ""Amish Paradise"".",10,23 July 2005,"On the train headed for Philadelphia, Amish widow Rachel Lapp (Kelly McGillis) tells her son Samuel (Lukas Haas): ""You're going to see a lot of interesting things there."" She doesn't know just how right she is! In the men's bathroom at the train station, Samuel does see something interesting: a murder. Det. Capt. John Book (Harrison Ford) tries to protect Rachel and Samuel, but through a series of incidents, the murderer - corrupt Det. James McFee (Danny Glover) - shoots Book, and Book has to hide out with the Amish. Over the next few days, he gets to experience every aspect of Amish life: milking cows, raising a barn, etc. At the end, he has to protect the entire Amish community from the corrupt cops who were behind the murder.I have liked every one of Peter Weir's movies, and ""Witness"" is part of that crowd. Weir does a masterful job dignifying a culture which we often regard as quaint or even weird. The Amish may have a different lifestyle, but they are non-violent if nothing else. In the movie, we even get to see a contrast between Book's violent world, and the peaceful Amish life; in one scene, Book decides that he has to punish some tourists who are abusing the Amish.On other thing is that I get the feeling that ""Weird Al"" Yankovic probably watched this movie to get ideas for his song ""Amish Paradise"" (a parody of Coolio's ""Gangsta Paradise""). The Amish probably didn't like that song, but you know Weird Al: he lets everyone have it equally.",Witness
9,jboothmillard,Witness,8,20 September 2005,"From Golden Globe nominated director Peter Weir (Dead Poets Society, The Truman Show), comes a really interesting story about crime, love and religion. Basically Rachel Lapp (Top Gun's BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Kelly McGillis) and her son Samuel (Mars Attacks! star Lucas Haas) are Amish, a religion who avoid modern convenience, such as cars and electricity. They were heading back to the home town from Philadelphia, but in the train station washroom, Samuel witnesses the brutal murder of a police officer, he only saw one face of two men. Detecive John Book (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Harrison Ford) is assigned to get a description from Samuel, and using many methods, e.g. photographs, rough handling, until eventually, Samuel sees the man on a newspaper sheet in the trophy cabinet, narcotics officer McFee (Danny Glover). To help protect them, he asks his partner to hide the case files, and he goes to join the Lapps in their community, also because he got wounded (gunshot) in his stomach. While there he gets to know the family, including husband and father Eli Lapp (Jan Rubes), helps the community with things, e.g. building a barn, but more prominently, he and Rachel almost fall in love, and a couple of scenes see there feelings grow, e.g. dancing to the car radio, John seeing her naked, and towards the end when they snog. Eventually though, the real villain, Deputy Commissioner Schaeffer (Josef Sommer), with McFee and a group of killers find the town and attempt to kill the witness and his family. Also starring Alexander Godunov as Daniel Hochleitner, Brent Jennings as Carter and The Lord of the Rings' young Viggo Mortensen as Moses Hochleitner. It won the Oscars for Best Film Editing and Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen, and it was nominated for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Cinematography, Best Music for Maurice Jarre and Best Picture, it won the BAFTA for Best Score, and it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Cinematography, Best Editing, Best Original Screenplay and Best Film, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Drama, Best Original Score and Best Screenplay.

10,ccthemovieman-1,One Of The Best Crime Moves Ever,10,24 June 2006,"You want to know how to make a successful movie? Just look here. You have tremendous suspense, a top-flight popular actor as the hero, a touching romance story, plenty of action, a different kind of setting than normal, people you care about, nice photography, very moral and very immoral people, a little humor.....I mean, this is how it's done.I also appreciated seeing Amish people (of which I am not) portrayed in a better light than secular Hollywood usually puts them. I also liked the wholesome female lead Kelly McGillis (although she was the only Amish character out of character, a bit loose than what you would ever find) and who didn't think young Lukas Haas was the cutest kid they ever saw on film?Harrison Ford gives a typical solid performance as John Book, a Philadelphia detective who winds up protecting the young boy (""Samuel Lapp""), his mom (McGillis as ""Rachel Lapp"") and others against crooked cops (Hollywood's favorite kind). Along the way, he is near-fatally shot and winds up being cared for and living in the Amish community in which the Lapps reside. During that time, we also have the blossoming romance between the two leads and then a dramatic shootout at the end when the cops find out where ""Book"" is staying.There are many memorable scenes in this movie, from the boy hiding in the bathroom stall as a murder takes place; Ford slugging some goon who was making fun of the Amish; Ford and McGillis dancing in the hayloft to an old rock 'n roll tune; the Amish lifestyles and the raising of the barn; and the suspenseful ending. This is a great stuff: one of the best crime stories of the ""modern age"" and one of the few ""R-rated"" films that reached this high a popularity.",Witness
11,Tweekums,A Philadelphia cop must live among the Amish to protect a young witness,10,14 January 2017,"While Rachel and her young son Sam, who are Amish, are travelling from their home in rural Pennsylvania to Baltimore they have to change trains in Philadelphia. Sam has to go to the toilet and while there witnesses a murder. It later emerges that the dead man was a policeman and while in the police station looking through photographs to identify the killer Sam spots him not in a mugshot but a photograph of a policeman. Detective John Book realises this is a dangerous situation so takes the matter to his boss. Soon after he is ambushed and wounded by one of the killers; he knows that he, Sam and his mother are in real danger so he takes them out of the city and back to their home in Lancaster County.Shortly after dropping them off he collapses due to his wound; he is treated by the Amish and as he recovers he must help in the local community and dress like one of them. While his former colleagues are trying to find where he has gone he continues to live among the Amish and grows close to Rachel; a closeness that could threaten her position in society that sees her as getting too close to an outsider and his inappropriate ways. Eventually he will have to face the corrupt cops to save both himself and those he has recently grown close to.On the face of it this could have been really corny but instead we get a really good story. It is hard to pin it down to a genre; at first it appears to be a crime drama but really that is just an excuse to force city cop John Book to live among the Amish; a society totally alien to what he is used to. Then there is the romance between Book and Rachel; in some ways this reminded me of 'Brief Encounter'; while neither character is married here there would still be problems if they got involved because of the rules of her society something Book grows to understand and respect. The cast does a really good job; especially Harrison Ford and Kelly McGillis as Book and Rachel. There is a small amount of violence and swearing as well as some brief nudity but for the most part things are things are fairly gentle. It may be over thirty years old but it has hardly dated as the majority of the film is set amongst the Amish and I don't imagine their society has changed as much as the rest of America has. Overall I'd certainly recommend this excellent film.",Witness
12,moonspinner55,"The ""Big City"" as dirty and corrupt...the Amish as waxworks saints",6,20 November 2010,"Amish youngster, away from the family farm in Lancaster County for the first time while visiting Philadelphia, witnesses a men's room killing, the victim a police officer; a good-hearted cop smells corruption and goes into hiding to help protect the child, falling in love with the boy's mother in the process. When ""Witness"" originally played in theaters, so much promise was built up by the intriguing scenario--and so much good will was brought forth by the combination of Harrison Ford in the lead and the fish-out-of-water story elements--that nobody seemed to mind much when the movie derailed near the end. Corny and clichéd throughout, it is still a picture that gets to some people, with shameless director Peter Weir mounting the proceedings for emotional--not logical--impact. ** from ****",Witness
13,Quinoa1984,"elegiac, romantic crime-thriller about a detective in Amish country",9,28 April 2008,"The Amish are 'simple folk', as they say, with a moral conscience that is nearly impeccable. While they are super religious (notice that they will never eat without first praying), their work ethic is next to extraordinary and they've fashioned their lives around a lack of technology, a distance from the rest of the modern world. Peter Weir's film Witness does what should be expected in a genre piece using this subject matter: place a regular guy (Harrison Ford) in the midst of this Amish world as a culture clash occurs. It sort of does, but what's trickier, and what Weir and Ford pull off, is to make it personal, of the disconnect between men and women and temptations. It's an R-rated movie, but not at all for sex, but at the same time there's a super hot scene where Ford dances with Kelly McGillis's Rachel in a barn to an old 60s tune. The tension is perfect.But the genre? Yes, it's the sort that we've probably seen in other films, with a corrupt cop story pitted into a unique location. The difference is that Weir wants to put a more visual take on things, to not force the conventions down the audience's throat while also making things enjoyable. The scoop: a young Amish boy (Lukas Haas) is with him mother on their way to Baltimore to visit family, and he is in the bathroom of the train station. He witnesses behind a closed door a murder take place between cops. He narrowly escapes, and is the only witness to the crime. He spots the man, and it becomes clear that the case is a lot dirtier than Ford's John Book would've imagined. With this premise, and that Book is shot and must stay put in Amish country for a bit, Weir explores the nature of the characters in this situation as opposed to the by-the-numbers plotting of the story, which are (thankfully) darker than one might usually expect.And a good deal of Witness's success is Ford in the role. He strips himself of most of his devices as a usual star (i.e. from the sarcastic tone of Han Solo or swagger of Indiana Jones), but still has a great 'star' presence; the producer initially cast him as he reminded him of Gary Cooper. He's charming and suave, but usually understated and strong in the performance, finding the right notes with McGillis for a romantic drama of this sort. It's worth checking out Witness for certain if you're a fan, or if you're interested in seeing this strange but sort of beautiful other world. Oddly enough, the musical score sounds a lot at times like that of Blade Runner (the Vangelis-type synthesizer), and it threw me off for a moment hearing those tones put to the film's picaresque scenes. And yet there's something to be said about this kind of being like something from another world, or at least another time.Witness is thrilling stuff for the mainstream crowds, and at the same time Weir's direction is something not to miss, where he provides ample control for the story, but gives it certain twists and with a loom that tells of something more purely cinematic than a standard cineplex offering.",Witness
14,sunwarrior13,Witness Ford As The Dramatic Actor Instead Of Ford As The Action/Adventure Icon,10,7 September 2012,"Witness is a film directed by Peter Weir.It stars Harrison Ford and Kelly McGillis. The screenplay by William Kelley, Pamela Wallace, and Earl W. Wallace focuses on a detective protecting a young Amish boy who becomes the target of a ruthless killer after he witnesses a murder in Philadelphia.It was nominated for eight Academy Awards and won two, for Best Original Screenplay and Best Film Editing. Rachel Lapp (McGillis), a young Amish widow, and her 8-year-old son Samuel are traveling by train to visit Rachel's sister. At the 30th Street Station in Philadelphia, Samuel inadvertently sees two men brutally murder a third. Samuel witnessed the murder, a slashing, in the restroom and escaped the killers' detection by hiding in a stall. Captain John Book (Ford) is the policeman assigned to the case.He and his partner, Sergeant Eldon Carter, question Samuel. He is unable to identify the perpetrator from mug shot photographs or a police lineup, but notices a newspaper clipping at the police station with a picture of highly regarded narcotics officer James McFee and recognizes him as one of the killers. Book remembers that McFee was previously responsible for a drug raid where evidence had mysteriously disappeared from the police department.When Book discovers that the crime was part of a conspiracy involving several officials in his department, he flees Philadelphia where Samuel lives. Slowly assimilating himself into the Amish community, Book eventually finds himself falling in love with Rachel in the midst of his investigation. Eventually, the corrupt police track Book down, and he is forced to confront them, while also trying to protect Rachel and Samuel. Harrison Ford renders one of his best dramatic performances, for which he won his sole Oscar nomination, in Weir's beautifully shot feature, which is effective as a cop thriller as well as a chronicle of the rural Amish subculture.Playing John Book allowed viewers the opportunity to see him as the actor instead of the action/adventure icon. It is one of the few times he has been given the opportunity to play in a straight drama.Aside from that,the movie has got some action, some romance, a few drips of comedy, and a lot of fascinating insight into a culture we know very little about.This is highly recommended to any viewer who loves to watch a good movie.",Witness

16,hitchcockthelegend,As 80s thrillers go it's pretty smart to say the least.,9,4 March 2008,"The formula of this thriller (Drama) is not (was) new or even flag bearing as regards action set pieces and hide behind your hands suspense, yet it is still one of a kind for the genre and the decade it came from.The plot is a sizzler as it involves the central theme of outsiders who are considered outside of the mainstream norm. To have a thriller involving the Amish community not only brings into focus how different folks' beliefs can be, but to also hit home at just how ignorant many are to the ways of minorities and what they stand for. So many great things about the movie stand out.Harrison Ford is perfect, yes it's a perfect performance, his John Book is gruff and rugged yet as the story moves on he nails the endearment and knowing traits that the character calls for. Kelly McGillis is an actress who I feel drags down nearly all the films she leads in, yet here I forgive her because she is marvellous as Rachael, an Amish woman fighting her inner feelings as much as she is the bad outside world that wants to hurt her son.Peter Weir IMHO is one of the most under praised modern day directors around (yes even now), and here his deft hands put the story together adroitly, whilst John Searle's cinematography is gorgeous and out of the top draw. It's an almost perfect movie as regards acting and the process of making a film, I do however fly in the face of popular opinion as regards the score, it doesn't work for me (I'm sad to say), Maurice Jarre's drawn out synth seems to me out of place for the setting we are watching, I personally would have liked a more subtle string arrangement - but that is me...For those looking for a first time viewing in the Drama/Thriller genre then they can do no worse than seek this one out. It delivers on a plot front, and the ending doesn't pander to studio yearnings either. 9/10The S/E DVD has a wonderful making of feature that is crammed full of quality input, and for Ford worshippers such as I, it contains none aloof input from the legend himself, that alone was worth the 5 Euros it cost me for this cracking film.",Witness
17,Scarecrow-88,Witness,10,19 August 2006,"John Book(Harrison Ford in perhaps his best film as an actor)discovers through the eye-witness of a young Amish boy, Samuel(Lukas Haas), that cops have murdered one of their own because said slain had uncovered a drug ring taking place with confiscated materials used to create speed. Unfortunate for John, he goes to a man he believes he can trust, Chief Paul Schaeffer(Josef Sommer), but doesn't know he's actually the mastermind behind the whole operation. Book is fired upon by Lt. McFee(Danny Glover), the cop who slit the throat of the cop. Book, bleeding profusely, flees with Rachel(Kelly McGillis, who is excellent)and her son Samuel to their Amish residence in order to keep them from possible harm. Book has been bleeding so badly, the Amish doctor will have to heal him and this opens the door for the film's ""fish-out-of-water"" theme never utilized better than in this film about a man who discovers the wonderful people in a village often criticized and slanted because of their differences in living in regards to society. It's always present, though, that Schaeffer would not rest until he finds Book and the child..their operation would ruin him. An important piece to Book's whereabouts lies in his partner Carter(Brent Jennings)who knows where he is. Schaeffer obviously understands their relationship is tight and needs to squeeze the information of Book's location from him. The film's main centerpiece is the growing bond between Book, an outsider, and Rachel. We can clearly see that this will never come to complete fruition because their worlds are so far apart, but we understand this love that permeates when they are near each other. It's a beautiful thing to watch slowly develop because upon Book's arrival, the village were quite worried of what troubles he might bring to their peaceful co-existence. The violence Book comes from is stagnant in one particular scene where John breaks the nose of a trouble-maker wishing to cause emotional distress the Amish people just desiring to go home. Eli(Jan Rubes, who is wonderful)tries in many ways to tame John, but he can not stand by, as the Amish people have, and see them mistreated because of who they are. His reaction is seen as immoral, but there seems to be an understanding that takes place here. We see that John absolutely cares for these people and when someone wishes to poke fun at their modest and quiet ways, it brings out the worst in him. I think the film's true beauty is how director Weir casts a respectful eye to the Amish way of life rather than the jokingly scornful way they are often portrayed. As most films of Weir are, this is magnificently photographed with a haunting lyrical score. The film also shows the clashing of two different ways of life as Rachel shows throughout her growing attraction to John. A suitor possibly for her is Daniel Hochleitner(Alexander Godunov), but the film thankfully stays away from him clashing with John over Rachel. John knows where Daniel stands and vice versa. We actually seem to see a camaraderie form between the two during a sequence where all the men band together and build a barn for a newly married couple. Book's being able to use his abilities at carpentry brings him a workman-like tolerance from the village despite being not one of them. Slowly but surely, John has been appreciated and loved by all as they accept him with the understanding that he will eventually go, but be remembered fondly. The final twenty or so minutes is the eventual encounter of Schaeffer and his two cop cronies trying to find John so they can silence him for good. John has found out that his partner was killed and threatened Schaeffer's life. In the confrontation, Schaeffer and John will meet and this shows a stand-off against the violence that has existed for too long. John wishes for the killing to stop after his successful survival against McFee and Fergie(Angus MacInnes). I think this is another great example that the 1980's was the decade of Harrison Ford. Hit after hit starred Ford and ""Witness"" is simply another fine example of marvelous work. Weir frames some magnificent shots of the green fields(I call them ""The fields of life"")and the camera lovingly captures the landscape of a peaceful group of people who just want to live without the outside corruption. Perhaps a little of what they live rubbed off on John..I believe it did.",Witness
18,Doylenf,One of Harrison Ford's finest performances...,7,25 June 2001,"Harrison Ford finally got an Oscar nomination for 'Witness' ('85) only to lose it to William Hurt (for 'Kiss of the Spider Woman'). Likewise, the film was nominated but came along in the same year that 'Out of Africa' swept most of the awards.The film itself begins to build suspense from the start, with the Amish boy (Lukas Haas) witnessing a murder in a men's restroom at a railroad station. Later, when Ford (as a tough policeman) questions the boy, he discovers there is corruption among his colleagues and becomes a cop in hiding while protecting the boy. The plot develops rather slowly after the initial murder as we focus more on Ford's relationship with the boy's mother (Kelly McGinnis). The interplay between Ford's character and the Amish woman is nicely developed, as is Ford's relationship with the boy. Before the conclusion, there is a scary scene in a silo that is milked for maximum suspense.Beautifully photographed to take advantage of its country settings, the screenplay and editing both received Oscars. Absorbing and thoroughly deserving of its Best Picture and Best Director (Peter Weir) nomination. Definitely Harrison Ford's best role until 1993's 'The Fugitive' in which he had an even stronger character to portray as a doctor seeking to prove his innocence.",Witness
19,preppy-3,The film that showed us that Harrison Ford could act!,7,7 September 2012,"A young Amish boy (played by a VERY young Lukas Haas) witnesses a murder while in Pennsylvania with his widowed mom Rachel (Kelly McGillis). Policeman John Book (Harrison Ford) is assigned to the case and discovers that two policemen ARE the murderers. He's hurt in a gun fight and ends up hiding out (and recovering) in an Amish community. Feelings grow between him and Rachel but they could never marry and the murderers are hunting him.This was a BIG bit back in 1984 and proved that Ford can act. Before this he was only known for the Star Wars movies and he was terrible in them (not his fault--the scripts were lousy). Here he gives a very good performance as Book. You can see the confusion in his face when he falls for Rachel but realizes he can never have her. McGillis is also excellent as the widowed Rachel. Exverybody else is pretty good and look for Brodway legend Patti LuPone in a small role. Haas is pretty terrible but he WAS very young. Also there's beautiful cinematography, great direction by Peter Weir and a haunting music score. Storywise this is nothing new--a man trying to adjust to a different way of life and finding love. It's been done before MANY times but this was well-done and is compelling. One BIG problem--The Amish are peaceful people and don't believe in fighting or violence and we're encouraged to cheer Book on when he punches out a kid making fun of the Amish!",Witness
20,CinemaSerf,A film within a film within a film...,7,16 March 2021,"When a young Amish boy ""Samuel"" (Lukas Haas) and his mum ""Rachel"" (Kelly McGillis) take a trip from their rural, largely agrarian, community into the big city he gets a little more than he bargained for - he witnesses the brutal murder of an undercover cop. The police decide the best way to protect him is to send him home to his family, accompanied by ""John Book"" (Harrison Ford), whist they await the trial. The perpetrators are on the hunt for him though, and it soon becomes clear that there is someone from within the investigation working with the baddies to track down and eliminate the witness. As an introduction to the lifestyle of this community, Peter Weir offers us quite an insightful assessment of a pacifist, technology free, society trying to live cheek by jowl with the relentless march pf progress and the teasing intolerance of their occasionally provocative neighbours. That they are wholly underprepared for what is coming when the location of the young lad is discovered, is an understatement - and this adds a great deal to the edginess of this thriller, as does the cunning game of cat and mouse amongst the grain silos at the end. There's romance too - as ""Book"" gradually falls for ""Rachel"" much to the chagrin of ""Daniel"" (Alexander Gudunov) which keeps the narrative progressing, albeit slowly, on that front, too. The script doesn't give Ford too much latitude when it comes to charisma - indeed, his characterisation is really rather dull and coupled with the serious paucity of verbiage from McGillis does hold the pace back for quite long chunks of the film. The years have not been especially kind to this - it has become more of a curio than any sort of gripping crime drama, but is still worth watching - and the 9 year old Hass is really rather impressive.",Witness
21,writers_reign,Plain and Stylish,8,6 January 2011,"I know only too well from bitter experience that films seen in youth and subsequently revisited have a low strike-rate in the holding up department. Last year Witness celebrated its quarter century so when I watched it again I was prepared for a disappointment that failed to materialize and I found it - with the usual reservations - as enjoyable as the first time round. The idea of bent cops is not exactly new nor, alas, the idea of corruption stretching all the way to the top - see LA Confidential for one - so ideally if you're taking that route you need a gimmick and Witness has a doozy, the social clash between the 'plain people' aka the Amish of Lancaster County, Pa, and the big city violence represented by Philadelphia. I've actually visited Lancaster County though not so much to gawp at the Amish as to visit the stamping ground of a favourite writer and whilst I did actually glimpse the Amish going about their business I know little more about them than that they speak 'Pennsylvania Dutch', wear plain clothing and eschew technology to the extent that there are no telephones, automobiles, dishwashers, televisions etc in their community. So I was a little surprised that Rachel (Kelly McGillis, would both elect and be allowed to travel by train to Baltimore to visit her sister. I was equally surprised that this very recent widow - the film opens with the funeral of her husband - should be more than prepared to form a new relationship with fellow Amish male, Daniel, and enjoy a sexual one with 'outsider' John Book (Harrison Ford). But these are relatively minor cavils - as is the last-reel shootout which pits and unarmed Book against three armed men from the Philadelphia plain-clothes division and including the corrupt chief of police. Book is able to take one of them out of the game but his cat-and-mouse game with just one of three was unbalanced, allotting a good five minutes of screen-time to this one encounter when in reality the other two men would be only metres away. Despite these flaws Witness remains a fine and extremely watchable film",Witness

But does that automatically mean that it's one of the best movies of all time? I don't think so.In my opinion the movie suffers from some serious pacing problems. I don't always like the point of view the story is told from and the order it's told in.But the movie also has good some good things in it. Actually lot's of them! For one I really have to say that this is possibly Harrison Ford's best role till date and Lukas Haas was a great child actor at the time. Way better then most of the kids these days. Also the little soundtrack from Maurice Jarre is very good. I also like the portrayal of the Amish people, actually watching this movie is a great lesson about the Amish. One more thing I liked were the characters.The story however is not always interesting and seems to take forever even though the movie has a good finale without falling into any cliché moments.Better as an Amish documentary then as a movie.6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Witness
23,view_and_review,Culture Clash,7,6 September 2018,Two worlds collide when an Amish boy witnesses a police officer being murdered while with his mother on the way to Baltimore. Being that the boy was a material witness detective John Book (Harrison Ford) needed him. Soon thereafter John would need the entire Amish community.This was a unique story with a familiar underlying story. The main story--the Amish witness--was fresh; the underlying story was not. Many movies have this storyline: it's the meeting of two cultures--usually a regular white American man has to spend time with a person or people of a different background. He learns something and the most beautiful girl falls for him even defying cultural restrictions. Witness had this underlying theme while the main theme played out.I don't know if this was an accurate depiction of the Amish but we got a glimpse that most probably never have seen. Ultimately the viewer can choose whether their lifestyle is virtuous or not but it was clear what characteristics the writer and director wanted to draw attention to. This was a good crime drama with an Amish backdrop.,Witness
24,evanston_dad,When Worlds Collide,7,8 April 2008,"This solid thriller stars Harrison Ford, given his first chance to truly act, as a detective who must infiltrate an Amish community in order to protect a little boy who accidentally witnessed a murder. Director Peter Weir and his screenwriter use the story as an opportunity to examine the culture clash between the modern world and the peaceful, insular world of the Amish. Ford's detective brings with him the violence and aggression of the outside world, but he also brings an understanding to the Amish, and especially to the mother of the little boy (played by Kelly McGillis), that at heart he's not much different than they are, even if their cultures are.It's a good if unremarkable film, hampered somewhat by an obligatory and unnecessary love story that merely serves to slow things down.Grade: A-",Witness

Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was a pretty good crime-drama which had an enjoyable plot, interesting scenery, good acting and a nice musical score. I especially liked the chemistry between both Harrison Ford and Kelly McGillis along with the performance of Alexander Godunov (as ""Daniel Hochleitner"").

26,HotToastyRag,Great thriller,8,24 October 2021,"For such a fascinating subject matter, very few movies have been made about Amish life. You can either rent Friendly Persuasion and suffer through Gary Cooper's ""thee"" and ""thou"" lines, or you can watch the suspenseful Witness. Tough decision.Witness has a really interesting premise, so even if 1985 was before your time, you'll probably still be drawn to the subject matter. A little Amish boy and his mother (Lukas Haas and Kelly McGillis, respectively) are taking a train in the city, an unusual occurrence for them. Even more unusual is a murder, which the little boy witnesses in the public restroom. Policeman Harrison Ford interviews Lukas for information, but when Lukas identifies the killer as another policeman (Danny Glover), Harry realizes everyone's in danger. He travels back with Lukas and Kelly to their Amish community to protect them, and he learns about their way of life.Even though the bulk of the movie takes place in the slow safety of the Amish countryside, it's a really tense movie. In the back of everyone's minds, the evil city and corrupt bad guys are just around the corner. While you might think you're just renting a charming romance for movie night, you're actually sitting down for an exciting thriller!

Here it's Harrison Ford, and in the 90s it was with Jim Carrey in The Truman Show.I love Witness and the performances of all. Danny Glover was a corrupt cop here, before he became a clean cop in Lethal Weapon a few years later.

That is a YouTube moment big time!",Witness
29,JamesHitchcock,One of the best films of the eighties and one of the best police thrillers of all time,9,7 October 2008,"If a poll were to be taken on who is the greatest living film director, a strong contender for my vote would be Peter Weir. (Other contenders would be Woody Allen and Martin Scorsese). He is able to produce both brilliantly original films quite different to anything else and also brilliant work within the confines of an established genre, an ability he shares with Scorsese and the late Stanley Kubrick. (As for Allen, he has turned the Woody Allen Film into a genre in its own right). Weir's ""Picnic at Hanging Rock and ""The Truman Show"" are both, in their different ways, strange and haunting films, different to anything before or since, and two of my favourite films of all time. On the other hand, ""Dead Poets' Society"", another of my favourite films, falls within the conventions of the ""inspirational teacher"" film, but is in my view the greatest example of that genre ever made. (Only ""The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie"" comes anywhere near it).""Witness"", his first film made outside Australia, is another example of Weir simultaneously working within an established genre and transcending it. On one level it is a traditional police thriller. While travelling with his mother a young boy named Samuel Lapp witnesses a murder in the washrooms at Philadelphia railway station. It turns out that the murdered man was an undercover police officer, and a homicide detective, John Book, is assigned to the case. Book's investigations lead him to the discovery that the murder was carried out by a narcotics officer named McFee, one of a group of corrupt officers in league with a gang of drug smugglers. Book is forced to go underground for safety, taking Samuel and his mother Rachel with him.On another level the film is a love story, as a romance develops between Book and Rachel, a beautiful young widow. Neither the crime story nor the romance element, however, would by themselves make this film anything out of the ordinary. What makes the film different is the third level, a study of cultural differences. Samuel and Rachel are members of the Amish religious sect, and it is among the Amish that they and Book take refuge while hiding from the villains.It would be easy to see the Amish, as portrayed in this film, as being quaint, even comically reactionary. They speak an archaic German dialect inaccurately known as ""Pennsylvania Dutch"" (although some of the lines in the film are in standard modern German). They follow a strict set of rules known as the ""Ordnung"" which govern every aspect of their daily lives. They may not own a television or a telephone and may not use electricity in the home. They drive horse-drawn buggies as it is forbidden to own or drive a motor vehicle. They have a strict dress code and are even forbidden to use buttons, regarded as a sign of ""Hochmut"", or pride. Those who violate these rules can be punished by shunning. The Amish habitually refer to all non-Amish Americans, regardless of ethnic background, as ""the English"". (News of the Declaration of Independence clearly has not yet filtered through to them).Yet, eccentric though they may seem to outsiders, Weir shows us that the Amish way of life has many virtues. They have a deep faith in God and believe in the importance of submission to His will. They have a strong sense of community. They are pacifists who are opposed to any violence or the taking of a human life; this article of their creed brings them into conflict with Book, who is required to carry a gun as part of his job and who is ready to use it, or his first, in self-defence or the defence of others. Because of the gulf between their value-systems, the love of Book and Rachel is potentially tragic; they can only be together if she is prepared to leave her world, or if he is prepared to enter it.Surprisingly, this was the film that brought Harrison Ford his only Oscar nomination to date. I say ""surprisingly"", as he has given many other fine performances in films such as ""Blade Runner"", ""The Fugitive"" and ""K-19"". ""Witness"", however, remains one of his best films; his Book is tough and uncompromising but decent, and capable of tenderness in the love scenes. Kelly McGillis, in her first major role, is luminously beautiful as Rachel; she was to give another great performance three years later in ""The Accused"", and I have always been surprised that her subsequent career has not been quite as successful. None of her films since 1988 have aroused as much interest as ""Witness"" or ""The Accused"", and she has not remained a household name in the same way as some of her contemporaries such as Kim Basinger, Michelle Pfeiffer or Jodie Foster.Despite the film's deeper levels of meaning, Weir does not neglect the thriller elements; there are some great Hitchcockian set pieces such as the scene where Samuel is hiding in the lavatories from the killer, or the final scene where Book confronts the villains who have invaded the Amish community in their search for him. In the scenes seen from Samuel's viewpoint, Weir uses low-angle shots to emphasise the boy's youth and vulnerability. The film, however, also has echoes of other genres, particularly the Western. The final scene has been compared to the climax of ""High Noon"" in which Gary Cooper also takes out his enemies one by one. (A similar climax was used in another Western, Clint Eastwood's ""Pale Rider"", also made in 1985). The spectacular barn-raising sequence, accompanied by Maurice Jarre's memorable score, also recalls the Western. With its intelligent script, fine acting and fine direction, ""Witness"" can be regarded as one of the best films of the eighties and one of the best police thrillers of all time. 9/10",Witness
30,MovieAddict2016,"Taut, tense and believable",9,29 April 2005,"""Witness"" has always been one of my favorite films and one that has struck close to home. My family comes from Pennsylvania's ""Amish country"" and I spent a great deal of time growing up around the Amish, even visiting their homes once in a while. When ""Witness"" came out, people finally started to take more of an interest -- or at least become aware of -- the Amish. Without this film, I very much doubt Randy Quaid would have played an Amish man in ""Kingpin."" And so on and so forth.""Witness"" is a very faithful adaptation of the Amish way of life, remaining respectful of the culture without resorting to the typical ""Hollywoodinization"" of the material. Yes, Kelly McGillis' character does transform a bit, but that's essential to the story. All the other characters remain the same, and do not change, which I felt was a very important aspect; how believable would this have been if, at the end, they all drove away in a car or something and ditched their roots. It'd be pretty embarrassing, I think.""Witness"" is one of the best films of its genre and an excellent character study. It is intelligently made, almost never (if ever) insulting, and features one of Harrison Ford's best performances.The conclusion does draw out a bit and perhaps a few minutes here and there could be cut without really harming the flow, but in my opinion the movie is only better due to its length -- it doesn't cater to the teen audiences who can't appreciate longer and quieter, subtler thrillers.In a decade when chills and spills were almost always involving teens having premarital sex and being sliced and diced by nameless, masked killers, ""Witness"" had a new angle to draw upon -- and it's about a hundred times more thrilling, and believable, than any of the other films released during the era.",Witness
31,sddavis63,The Police Drama Is Nothing Special But This Is A Fascinating Look At Amish Culture And Community,7,26 February 2010,"This was certainly a different role for Harrison Ford. In 1985, he was known mostly for his work in action/adventure movies (in particular, of course, the Star Wars and Indiana Jones movies.) Aside from that he had done mostly guest work in TV series. ""Witness"" - although it has some action scenes - is about as far removed from an action/adventure movie as you can get, and Ford pulled it off well. The movie is book-ended by a story about police corruption, as a young Amish boy (well played by Lukas Haas) witnesses the murder of an undercover police officer, and then identifies the killer as another cop. Ford's Det. John Book (an appropriately ""simple"" name) decides to root out the corruption, but then has to hide out in the boy's Amish community to protect both the boy and himself from the cops he's going after. A story about crooked cops is nothing really special, but the appeal of the movie is really this look at the inner workings of an Amish community.This is rather slow-paced, and while that's usually a criticism, in this case it fits the Amish setting perfectly. Book - taken in by the boy's family - has trouble adjusting, but develops an affection for the community - and, of course, for the boy's mother Rachel (Kelly McGillis), although their relationship is kept platonic. Throughout the movie you get a real sense of the tightness of the close-knit Amish community through such depictions as the barn-raising for a newly married couple and the entire community rushing to Eli's farm when the bell rings. The movie makes good use of what I would call low-key humour. It's never laugh out loud funny, but there are simple scenes, like old Eli waking Book up with the words ""4:30 - time for milking!"" that you can't help but smile at. What I see as the inherent contradiction of Amish life is also shown here. They're a simple community, deliberately keeping everything simple to avoid any sense of pride, and yet by keeping themselves so simple they turn themselves into the centre of attention - a tourist trap for Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. Strange, but not being Amish I'll comment no further on that.The action returns to the movie in the last 20 minutes or so, as the crooked cops find Book and their final confrontation takes place on Eli's farm. Book finally has to leave their world to return to his own, but the fondness his host family has developed for him is shown at the end, when old Eli says to him as he drives away, ""you be careful out there among them English."" This isn't ""exciting"" for the most part, but it's a very pleasant and enjoyable movie to watch.",Witness
32,ElMaruecan82,"Why ""Witness"" rhymes with Greatness ...",10,10 February 2012,"I have always loved the conclusion of Roger Ebert's review: ""It is a movie about adults, whose lives have dignity and whose choices matter to them. And it is also one hell of a thriller."" Indeed, Peter Weir's ""Witness"" appeals on a primal basis as a thriller, and a great one while the romance and the immersion into the Amish community are only one of these layers that convey the comfortable feeling that we're watching something different.Cinema is sometimes like cooking, with the same ingredients, you can either make a delightfully exquisite plate or a vulgar sandwich and what makes ""Witness"" great is that it brings to the screen something new by using familiar elements. The hero is John Book, a man who has neither the physical super strength, nor the cynical detachment of the typical leading cop, yet he manages to appeal because he exudes a sense of dignity, of competence, and attachment to his line of duty, without falling in any stereotypical trap. This has something to do with Harrison Ford's performance, a subtle and powerful incarnation of a character who, more than anything, is profoundly human and doesn't try to be an archetype. With such a solid character, ""Witness"" already gains our heart.But a character doesn't make a film, the plot also is a masterstroke of simplicity and genius. It opens with Rachel, a young Amish widow played by Kelly McGillis, and her young 8-year old son, Samuel, the young Lukas Haas. Coming back from a family visit, little Samuel witnesses a horrific murder in the toilets of Philadelphia's train station. A gentle-looking man carrying a notebook, is killed by two others, one of them is the fierce looking Danny Glover as officer McFee. What follows is intense and suspenseful on a Hitchcockian level, as it uses a clever trick to make Samuel miraculously escape from the menace of Glover's character. Twenty years ago, I was shocked by the slashing, but it was the convincing sign about McFee's mercilessness, no doubt a little kid wouldn't discourage them for a bonus murder.The toilet scene alone illustrates the symbiosis between the engaging atmosphere of the film and its intelligent writing, winning Oscars over masterpieces of originality such as ""The Purple Rose of Cairo"" or ""Back to the Future"". After the murder, Book questions the kid and tries to get the maximum of information. The film could have contented its audience with Samuel saying that the man was black like Book's partner, and a big guy, not a 'schtumpig', then Book would have deducted that McFee was the one; I don't think it would even have been perceived as lazy writing. But the film offers us one of the most memorable silent tracking shots when Samuel is slowly pacing through the police office and then pauses when he recognizes McFee's face in a newspaper. Then, there's something in Ford's look where he sees what he sees, and think what he thinks, the moment when Samuel points his finger is pure genius.Book quickly understands that poor Samuel is a more important witness, that McFee killed a cop who was getting some seriously damaging elements for his career, after sharing this information with his superior Chief Paul Schaeffer (Josef Somer), Book is coincidentally confronted with McFee, and nearly escape from an attack. With enough to time to take the boy and his mother to the Amish Camp, Book finally faints from the loss of blood due to a bullet wound, and must be cured by the Amish. The film then plunge us into the austere and respectable Amish community, with enough patience to develop the relationship between Rachel and John, and Book's progressive integration, undermined in a few instances, all extremely memorable, when John and Rachel dance together, their unforgettable frenetic kiss under the rain, when she shows her body naked to her and of course, one of the most satisfying punches in the face when a young tourist prick gets his comeuppance.If a great movie features at least three great scenes, with the punch it makes three with the killing and the recognition of the killer, yet they're not even the highlights of the films. It's also interesting to note that this scene isn't gratuitous and will be the pivotal moment that brings the attention of Schaeffer and the two other corrupt cops. By acting according to his principle, Book makes the confrontation finally possible, a necessary mistake because somehow, he couldn't hide forever, that's against his nature, his sense of dignity. Not a hero, not a cop, he's also man, and it's interesting how the film uses Ford's notorious carpenter's talent for the rising barn scene, as it really enriches his character by portraying him as a man with other talents than using guns.It's indeed without a weapon that John manages to escape and finally defeat the three cops coming to him, in an unforgettable climactic scene where, another surprise, the bad villain receives an instant and quick death while the most horrifying and painful was reserved for a sidekick in one of these scenes that are impossible to erase from memory, the silo death where the villain receives tons of corn on his head. It was so beautifully shot that I really felt like he was suffocating and coughing snots and blood. No room for clichés till the end where finally Schaefer is forced to leave his gun, after facing a whole community of Amish standing for Book, the film is beyond the eternal hero vs. villain shootout, this is the kind of maturity and confidence that deserves respect.So many memorable scenes to list them all, a dazzling cinematography and gripping atmosphere ""Witness"" is a heart-pounding experience on many levels, that I never forgot since I was 10? If only because it taught me something about the Amish community, and I can't conclude without quoting Ebert again, yes, ""it's one hell of a thriller"".",Witness

But for whatever reason, I never got into it. The pacing is slow, the acting is slightly above average (but nothing award level), and I can't help but think it's a film of its time. The opening thirty minutes present a promising story about a young Amish boy who finds himself in the midst of a murder mystery, but then the film becomes a lackluster romantic film, only to be finished off in the last 20 minutes as a bloody shootout. It never really knows what it wants to be and seems to be flying by the seat of its pants.

Also, you really cannot classify this as thriller for the entire film because the middle portion is a haunting study on a group of peaceful people living away from technology. Harrison Ford gets out of his action movies to have one of the best roles of his career playing John Book.Peter Weir's film is about a hard-nosed detective named John Book who investigates a murder that a small Amish boy witnessed. Thanks to some betrayal, John is forced to live with the Amish and away from being a cop, he forbiddenly falls in love with Rachel, a beautiful Amish woman.As mentioned before, Harrison gives one of his better roles and is full of heartfelt emotion. Kelly McGillis, in her second ever movie, rises to great heights with her shy performance. I also find it ironic how Danny Glover plays a villain who murders cops right before his famed Lethal Weapon series.Overall, Witness is a beautifully shot film that has some intense scenes especially in the beginning and the end. We get to meet a group of people that stay away from society. The music by Maurice Jarre is wonderful and fits well with the themes of the movie.

The film is at its best in the scenes set in the Amish country, where the cinematography has the beauty of paintings. Particularly memorable is Ford and McGillis dancing to ""Wonderful World.""

38,slightlymad22,Possibly Harrison Ford's Best Performance,8,5 December 2014,"I love him as Indiana Jones, likewise Han Solo in the Star Wars movies, but ""Witness"" may just feature Harrison Ford's best performance. I actually think he should have took home the Best Actor Oscar home that year as opposed to William Hurt for Kiss of the Spider Woman (Though I understand why he got it) Plot In A Paragraph: A young Amish boy is a witness to a murder in a train station, Philadelphia detective John Booker (Ford) is assigned to the case. When he realises the murderer is a fellow detective he is forced to flee to the Amish community to protect the witness.In a role turned down by Sylvester Stallone (Not one of his better decisions) Harrison Ford is superb. Tough yet vulnerable, Brave yet scared. And he hurts, at a time when all our heroes are superheroes or indestructible one man armies, Ford gives us a good guy who is scared and feels pain. Kelly McGillis (whilst I've never fund her attractive) is appealing here as the grieving widow and mother. Of the supporting cast Jan Rube as Eli stands out as the best, Lukas Haas is very good as the title character, Alexander Godunov is very good and convincing as Daniel (A potential love interest for McGillis) look out for a young Viggo Mortensen as his brother Moses. It's interesting seeing Danny Glover as a corrupt cop.One of my only gripes is the music, very dated and of its time.",Witness
39,zkonedog,Decent Flick That Comes Across A Bit Formulaic,6,7 March 2017,"Of the many movies I have reviewed on Amazon thus far, ""Witness"" is a strange one in that while it does contain some great scenes, it is (at its core) quite formulaic and very much a product of its times (i.e. doesn't hold up quite as well over time).For a basic plot summary, ""Witness"" is a story about a young Amish boy named Samuel (Lukas Haas), who witnesses a police officer murder another man in cold blood. Along with mother Rachel (Kelly McGillis), Samuel is put under the protective custody of Detective John Book (Harrison Ford), where they ultimately end up back in the Amish settlement.There are, indeed, quite a few great moments in this movie. The concept in and of itself is fascinated (a closer look at the Amish), and in this respect the acting of Harrison Ford is truly the stalwart quality of the entire film. Some of the best scenes, including the now-iconic ""ice cream cone scene"", involve Ford's character trying to fit in or adjust to the foreign (at least to his way of thinking) Amish society.The reason this film is no classic, though, is because it is very paint-by-numbers in many respects. It was as if the studio sat down and said ""Harrison Ford is big right now and McGillis has the sex appeal factor...we need to make a movie to capitalize on these two things"". While there is nothing wrong with that of thinking, per se, it is not the kind of creative thinking from which masterpieces are usually created. A ridiculously out-of-place McGillis nude scene is an example to prove my point.Overall, ""Witness"" is a decent flick that is too ""stock"" to ever sniff greatness. Enjoy Ford and the uniqueness of the Amish, but don't go looking for all that much more.",Witness
40,leplatypus,Witness this compassionate movie with the most compassionate actor and an amazing future stars (rental),10,23 October 2014,"I have a moving story with this movie. I first watched it by glimpses when I traveled America coast to coast this summer 2014 with 6 friends in a big tourism bus! I think our guide put it the day we did Cleveland – Niagara Falls. As I'm hard-of-hearing and there weren't subtitles on the screens, I just couldn't hear clearly what was said and so the projection was useless. Next, after 23 days of travel, it was broadcast the day I came back but I had to postpone it again as I had to get up early the next day to go to work again! Now, as I begin my Harrison's run, I just can't pick another movie!Now, i can say that it's still an excellent testimony about my travel as it tells really the America I have discovered: a farming country in the east with endless green meadows, a land of liberty and spirituality! This Amish country just couldn't exist in France as my fellows are intolerant against believers and our administration just can't let citizens do what they just want to do! In a way, this movie prefigures « the last samurai » as it's about a modern man getting into another culture and giving as well a sense to his life. Harrisson was the best pick ever as he has this amazing quality to be as remote and distant as warmly and caring. In addition, his partners will have a tremendous career after : « top gun », « lethal weapon », « mars attacks », « lord of the rings » This movie just confirms that Weir is a top-notch director with fundamental opinions : compassion, technology and faith.It offers also one of the best scene I have seen about faith when the Amish Grandpa explains guns to the kid : the total prohibition of guns and killing is indeed the best, clear statement to consider life as sacred and thus the only criteria to judge a « good » guy from a « bad » one. Nowadays, we find logic to kill the bad guys but I disagree : As bad guys want already to annihilate good guys, with this reverse propaganda, at the end, everyone will kill the other for a reason, so everyone is one and the same ! So as Grandpa says, one man can't indulge the right to judge that other has to die (it's God stuff) thus nobody can kill and indeed weapons are devil's tools !",Witness

Harrison Ford plays a policeman who protects a little Amish child that witnessed police brutality. The policemen go after the kid. Harrison Ford is there to protect the kid. They both flee to Amish country. Will they corrupt policemen find the kid? That is the suspense of this story. Really great suspense and I have seen decades of police thrillers. Witness is out there with the very best.Seriously.However back in the eighties the studios werent interested in this script about a rural Amish community sheltering a little boy who was witness to a police killing. Rural stories dont sell, was the fear of the studio executives. How wrong could they haven been! Witness became the second biggest box office hit of 1985. This movie was directed by Peter Weir known from ""The Truman Show"" with Jim Carey, ""Dead Poets Society"" with Robin Williams and ""Fearless"" with Jeff Bridges. It is one of the few movies that are highly praised by critics and the movie masses simultaneously. Witness is Included among the American Film Institute's 1998 list of the 400 movies nominated for the Top 100 Greatest American Movies and was one of the biggest box office hits of the entire eighties.Initially the Amish community was asked to take part in the movie, but they refused for several reasons: one being the fact that they dont want their picture taken, the other being the violence that was portrayed in the movie.
In preparation for her role, Kelly McGillis lived with an actual Amish widow and her seven children for a while before filming began to get the speech cadence down and to observe the daily life of an Amish widowed mother. Harrison Ford worked alongside real policemen to learn the police jargon and attitudes. Harrison Ford was nominated for Best Actor, his one and only Oscar nomination in his entire carreer! When a movie is praised by critics and welcomed by the popular masses it is difficult to choose where I want to begin in reviewing the brilliance of this movie. I want to highlight 2 brilliant parts of this movie that really mesmirized me with their beauty. One being the lighting of this film. I rarely have seen such excellent qualities of lighting and photography in other movies. Some still shots almost resemble the beauty of paintings. Kelly McGillis playing an Amish widow, was lighted and photographed in such a splendid way that it looked as if the director had created a painting like aura of light around her. Breathtaking beauty.The other part I want to highlight is the synthesizer music by Maurice Jarre. Almost resembling church organ sounds, Jarre's soundtrack is overwhelmingly powerful. Altough very modern sounding it fits perfectly into the old fashioned Amish style of living. Some viewers hated it though, but I am very picky about music in movies and I really was impressed by it. I have seen it over 10 times now and some movies just stay as powerful as they were when they were first released. 30 years old, Witness has become a timeless classic. I love it!",Witness

45,ackstasis,"""We want nothing to do with your laws""",7,29 June 2008,"I daresay that I would have enjoyed 'Witness (1985)' even more had it remained a conventional mystery thriller. This, perhaps, reflects rather negatively on my film-buff credentials, but the film's opening act mounted the tension so brilliantly that it was a pity to see that suspense slowly dissipate into the background. Such an appeal, however, seems quite groundless where director Peter Weir is concerned; given my previous experience with his work, both in Australian cinema (the classic war picture, 'Gallipoli (1981)') and following his move to Hollywood (the uplifting 'Dead Poet's Society (1989)'), Weir has always favoured emotion and human interaction over the raw thrill of adrenalin-charged action. Even as it stands, 'Witness' deserves to be celebrated for its strong performances, sensitive screenplay and thoughtful exploration of the contrast between the pacifism of the Amish people and the violence and corruption of 1980s mainstream America. The film was Weir's first in Hollywood, after achieving great success with the Australian productions 'Gallipoli' and 'The Year of Living Dangerously (1982).'Following the death of her husband, a grieving Amish woman, Rachel Lapp (Kelly McGillis), takes her young son Samuel (Lukas Haas) into the city. It is Samuel's first major venture into the lifestyle shunned by his people, and he is initially awed and excited by all the fresh sights and sounds presented to him. But it doesn't take long for the reality of modern society, corrupted and poisoned by the stench of greed and violence, to rear it's ugly head  in the bathroom of a railway station, Samuel witnesses the brutal murder of a city detective, and only he can identify the men responsible. A weary cop, Det. Capt. John Book (Harrison Ford), employs the young boy's help in solving the case, and, when Samuel positively identifies a respected narcotics detective from his own department, Book begins to understand that they've stumbled into something far deeper than anybody could ever have anticipated. Now with a price on his head, Book falls into hiding with the reluctant Amish community, and both parties come to learn a thing or two about the conflicting values of their respective worlds.Harrison Ford has rarely given a better performance. He's not an actor whom one would typically associate with having a lot of emotional range, but John Book is an intriguingly-subtle character. Note, most particularly, the scene in which Book and Rachel dance in the barn to Sam Cooke's ""Wonderful World""  throughout the entire sequence, Book is continually pausing, contemplating the physical contact that is seemingly obligatory in cinematic moments such as these, and consistently deciding against it. Kelly McGillis is remarkably beautiful as the emotionally-conflicted widow, all the more because her character actively attempts to repress any lingering streaks of eroticism (and also thanks to her Amish attire, which fortunately denied her one of those horrifically-dated 1980s hairstyles  see 'Top Gun (1987)'). A crucial benefit of the film's sobering middle act, supplemented by the soft, graceful cinematography of John Seale, is that the audience gradually loses his desensitisation towards violence on film, and so the story's brutal climax is a completely jarring shock to the nerves.",Witness

53,PredragReviews,Ford At His Best,9,5 May 2016,"Although I suppose ""Blade Runner"" is the movie that showed Harrison Ford could do something outside of ""Star Wars"", I personally think ""Witness"" was one of the most important movies of his career, because it's a complete departure from a science fiction storyline, and therefore paved the way for all the Tom Clancy stuff and other movies that featured him as a romantic hero. Featuring a rich, startling performance from Ford and a powerful turn by Kelly McGillis (who had only appeared on ""One Life to Live"", a TV movie and the marvelous film ""Rueben, Rueben"" at that point in her career) ""Witness"" still manages to amaze with the suspense that Weir generates in the film.The contrast between the gritty urban police precinct and the bucolic Amish farm country is one of the best things about the film. Book dressed in a blue shirt and black trousers several inches too short for him, looking like the proverbial fish out of the water, is a sight to behold. All of a sudden he's back in the nineteenth century -- no electricity, no cars, no TV or computers. He might as well be on another planet. And the Amish are as different from him as space aliens; gentle, quiet pacifists, hardworking and industrious, intent on keeping the outside world as far from them as possible. They are neighborly and cooperative; the barn-raising scene is inspiring to watch. We feel sympathy for these quiet, decent people as the outside world keeps encroaching, and see them trying to navigate a horse and buggy on the Interstate. Book has to try to fit into this world, and he gives it his best shot. He joins in the barn-raising, does odd chores around the farm. But the Amish, while they respect his abilities, hold him at arm's length. For one thing, he's falling in love with the young widow Lapp, whose feeling for him is mutual. For another, his assimilation is only skin-deep; on a trip into town, when a group of local louts start pestering the Amish, Book chips in with a right to the lout's nose that leaves his face a bloody mess. It's going to prove his undoing; back in his precinct, the narcotics agent and the captain have gotten wind of his hideout, and now they come to shut him up once and for all, and silence Samuel as well. 'Witness' is not an action/adventure blockbuster like the movies that made Ford a household name, but it doesn't need pyrotechnics to stand out. It's a well-crafted, well-acted, eminently satisfying movie.Overall rating: 9 out of 10.",Witness

In my opinion his last excellent movie was ""The Fugitive"", but he has done some very fine things before that as well as this ""Witness"" proves.While traveling with his mother Rachel, a young Amish boy called Samual Lap, witnesses a murder in a washroom at the train station in Philadelphia and detective John Book is assigned to the case. Shortly after the first investigation, the boy recognizes narcotics officer McFee as the murderer. Book soon discovers that McFee was involved in the theft of an ingredient used in the making of drugs and he gives all the information he has to his boss. Shortly after, McFee comes after him and wounds him in a shootout. Book decides to flee and sees no better option but to stay within the peaceful Amish community to which the Lap family belongs. While Book and Rachel start to get feelings for each other, he helps the community as much as he can, although sometimes in his own 'modern' way, which the Amish do not approve of. But hiding for them doesn't mean that the crooked cops have forgotten about him and one day they find him...I've already said it before and I'll say it again: Even though Harrison Ford now seems to have lost that feeling, in the past he really knew how to pick some very good scripts. The entire story is original and in a way also very daring. Who comes up with the idea to bring violence into the world of the Amish, who are seen as some kind of attraction, as some kind of freak show even? It's an incredible contradiction, just as the forbidden love between Book and Rachel is, but somehow they managed to make a very good movie out of it. It has some action, but not too much; the relationship isn't corny at all; the outcome of the movie isn't too obvious;... I must say I really appreciate that. This could easily have gone wrong in so many parts, but it didn't. This was a very strong movie.Also very good were the performances of the different actors. Except for Harrison Ford, Danny Glover, Viggo Mortensen and perhaps Kelly McGillis, I can't say that I know any of them, which isn't a very big surprise if you know that some of them are really Amish and no professional actors.

56,tomsview,When the stars align,10,7 March 2015,"If there is one Australian director who has the cred to sit at the grown-ups' table with the likes of Spielberg, Coppola and Scorsese, it's Peter Weir.He has many movies under his belt now, and they include a few that are pretty close to masterpieces: ""Picnic at Hanging Rock"", ""Gallipoli"", ""Dead Poet's Society"", ""Master and Commander"", and maybe this one.Although we have seen the basic ingredients before, ""Witness"" approaches the cop movie genre from a whole new angle, setting a tough urban detective amongst the insular and peaceful Amish of Pennsylvania. Some of the most intriguing scenes contrast the Amish lifestyle with that of the modern world such as the deep-focus shots of the horse-drawn Amish buggies with semi-trailers thundering by in the background.This was Weir's first Hollywood film, and as Australians have often found with our own cinema, the outsider view can be the most penetrating. Weir also brings humanity and humour to all his films - lightness of touch is one of his trademarks.The heart of the film is the growing relationship between Harrison Ford's John Book and Kelly McGillis' Rachel Lapp; he the tough city cop, she the young widow from a sheltered, devout rural community. The ending is bittersweet; they come from worlds that just don't intersect.Many other elements came together to make this film unique. The inspired original screenplay draws us into almost another world while the cinematography captures the sweep of the rural setting as well as moments of great intimacy.And then there is the music. It's often said that a background score should not be noticed, but Maurice Jarre created a work that is right to the fore. Jarre created some great scores - ""Lawrence of Arabia"", ""Doctor Zhivago"" and ""The Professionals"", although later he tended to become predictable. However, like Jerry Goldsmith, just when you thought you had heard everything the guy had to offer, he'd take your breath away with something totally fresh and original. ""Witness"" was his first electronic score; he could have gone orchestral, but that organ sound is perfect for the story. In the building the barn sequence, the music builds and builds and then soars as John Book and the Amish raise the wooden framework into position - a triumph of film scoring.Recent documentaries would indicate that the Amish haven't changed that much since ""Witness"" was made 30 years ago; the film has hardly dated; it's just a great piece of filmmaking.",Witness
57,DeeNine-2,The thriller as a passionate love story,9,13 September 1999,"As a connoisseur of the thriller genre I can tell you this is one of the best ever made. Harrison Ford is better than I have ever seen him; the scenes with eight-year-old Lukas Haas are magical, and Kelly McGillis projects the primeval power of a woman like few you'll ever see. Peter Weir's direction is practically flawless. The evil cops are as evil as evil can be, and the Amish are treated kindly, with respect and admiration. Quite simply though, the reason this is a great thriller is that it is a powerful love story.The passionate love that is felt and built upon, but not consummated, envelops the audience in anticipation. What makes this happen is some real-not contrived-obstacle to the expression of that love, such as the lovers being from different and warring families, as in ""Romeo and Juliet,"" or from different cultures, as here in ""Witness."" She is Amish, and he is a big city cop who ""whacks"" people. For their love to work, a gulf as wide as the Pacific Ocean has to be bridged. I think the carefully constructed script by William Kelley gives us an ending we can live with. Watch it and see if you agree.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon!)",Witness
58,punishmentpark,Typical '80s in many ways - which can be a good thing.,8,11 February 2014,"It's been a while since I last saw this one, and it's still quite a nice one. The rather crude assembly of two plots, one (romantic) drama and one thriller, may not work for everyone, but I'm okay with this odd, yet clear structure. The obvious soundtrack of the eighties, Maurice Jarre taking it away on the synths, may also not work (anymore) for everyone in this day and age, but, again, I liked it. The acting, also sort of eighty-ish but I'm not sure how to describe it, works just fine within what 'Witness' really is, as I see it: a tale of a culture clash that is formed by showing both sides, and with plenty of room for interaction. When Eli and Samuel talk about revenge, for instance, that must be as close to the core of what Peter Weir had in mind. Striking debut by Lukas Haas.8 out of 10.",Witness
59,seymourblack-1,"Murder, Corruption & Doomed Love",9,15 December 2012,"""Witness"" is a subtle, thoughtful and intelligently directed film which is both a crime thriller and an extraordinary love story. A police investigation into a brutal murder provides this drama with its momentum and drive and a tragic romantic tale adds the intensity, warmth and poignancy that elevates this movie to a higher level than that normally achieved by more routine thrillers. The story about two people from different backgrounds who fall in love, but know that their love can't transcend their circumstances, has a timeless and universal appeal which explains why this movie has retained its popularity so consistently since it was first released in 1985.When a recently widowed young Amish woman and her son are in a train station in Philadelphia, the 8-year-old boy witnesses the murder of an undercover cop. Detective Captain John Book (Harrison Ford) is put in charge of the investigation and questions Samuel Lapp (Lukas Haas), but even after showing him mug shots and arranging line-ups of suspects, the boy isn't able to finger the culprit. A little while later, however, Samuel is looking around the police office when he notices the killer's picture on a newspaper clipping that's pinned up inside a glass cabinet. When he brings this to Book's attention, it's quite a shock because the man in the photograph is the highly decorated Detective Lieutenant McFee (Danny Glover) of the Narcotics Division.Detective Book tells his superior officer Detective Chief Schaeffer (Josef Sommer) about this development and Schaeffer asks him to keep the information confidential. Shortly after, when he's shot at and injured by McFee, it becomes obvious to Book that McFee and Schaeffer are both corrupt and Samuel and his mother Rachel (Kelly McGillis) are in mortal danger. In order to protect them, Book drives them back to their Amish community but after his arrival there, he collapses and has to remain with the Amish where Rachel gradually nurses him back to health.During Book's period of recuperation, he and Rachel fall in love but he soon realises that neither of them could survive indefinitely in the other's world. Book adapts well to living with the Amish and earns their respect as he readily helps with milking cows and building a barn, but his presence in their community places them in danger, as becomes all too clear when the story reaches its action-packed conclusion.Non-verbal communication is used frequently in this movie and provides the action with an extremely natural feel. A couple of the stand-out sequences are those in which Samuel looks at Book in a way that immediately signifies that he's seen something important (when he sees McFee's photograph) and another is when Book and Rachel dance together in a barn to Sam Cooke's ""What A Wonderful World"". The power to convey their thoughts and feelings so clearly in this way is very touching at times and also testifies strongly to the quality of the acting.The differences between the worlds that Book and Rachel inhabit couldn't be greater as the Amish reside in rural surroundings and live a quiet, non-violent existence in which it's normal for everyone to help everyone else. These people embrace old fashioned values and don't use modern conveniences such as cars and refrigerators etc. By contrast, Book's existence as a city cop is far less serene and regularly brings him into contact with violence, corruption and various other forms of errant human behaviour.""Witness"", with its interesting characters, its absorbing story of murder, corruption and doomed love and its marvellous acting performances, is tremendously enjoyable to watch and leaves a lasting impression.",Witness
60,RNMorton,What a Great Movie,9,17 February 2007,"If you ever wonder where Harrison Ford got his chops as a leading man, all you have to do is dial in this movie. He's effectively understated in role of detective caught up in lethal police shenanigans, eventually forced to hide out with the Pennsylvania Amish. McGillis is equally effective as the mom of the young witness Ford wants to protect, exquisitely played by Haas. Hard to believe Danny Glover is a bad guy but he does a nice job as the heavy. We live near the Amish in Lancaster County and they seem to do a good job with the culture, I don't know enough to say more. Refreshing to have a movie where the love angle doesn't end up quite where you might expect it to. The dirty police angle is handled just a little too simplistically and unbelievably, for which this gets docked a point. I never saw Out of Africa but just the same it's hard to believe it should have beaten this for the Oscar. The barn raising segment in itself is magic. Nice to see a pre-LOTR Mortensen out there. Enjoyably slow moving with a great musical score.",Witness
61,rupie,topnotch,9,13 September 2002,"This is one of those movies whose virtues and subtleties become more and more apparent with subsequent viewings. The crime story is nothing more than a pretense - a ""MacGuffin"", in Hitchcock's phrase - on which to hang this sensitive and insightful story of the conflict between modernity and the culture of the Amish, which is portrayed here with admiring respect and not a hint of condescension. Harrison Ford's portrayal of John Book is perhaps his finest work on screen so far. In particular, Book's struggle to suppress his rising attraction for Rachel, and his tormented realization that a relationship between them is not possible, is achingly portrayed. Ford's effort is well-matched by Kelly McGillis, whose beauty here is almost breathtaking. The erotic interplay between them, because it is unconsummated, radiates an almost painful tension, and the easily lampooned ""running through the field"" scene - because it has been led up to so convincingly - is almost heartbreaking. The character of Eli Lapp, wonderfully played by Jan Rubes, is richly multifaceted. His suspicion of the ""English"" outsider and his anger at Rachel's attraction to him, is surmounted by an underlying humanity. His parting words to Book, ""You be careful out there among them English,"" are moving testimony to his acceptance of him. His stern yet loving dialogue to his grandson about renouncing hatred and violence is a treasured moment. Both direction and cinematography are splendid. The simplicity of Amish interiors is shot in a way that makes its austerity almost beautiful, and the barnraising scene is an exercise in cinematic lyricism.It would be easy to fault the movie for the facile scene in which the punks taunting of Book's newfound friends and protectors drives him over the edge (Eli: ""It's not our way, Book"" / Book: ""No, but it's MY way.""), but his gift to the young thug of a bloody nose is mighty satisfying to behold.My one criticism is with the music; certainly not with the venerable Maurice Jarre's score itself, but with its paltry synthesized realization. They should have found the money to spring for a full orchestra.In short, a highly satisfying, richly themed, and multifaceted film which is well worth watching.",Witness

It is a film about adults, whose lives have dignity and whose choices matter to them. The story focuses on a detective (Harrison Ford) protecting a young Amish boy who becomes the target of a ruthless killer after he witnesses a brutal murder in Philadelphia's 30th Street train station.Witness is as much about the meeting of cultures as about cops and robbers, this is one of those lucky movies which works out well on all counts and shows that there are still craftsmen lurking in Hollywood.

63,gab-14712,Harrison Ford Shines Brightly!,9,27 May 2020,"Peter Weir's Witness is a movie that literally took my breath away. The film was marketed as a tense thriller set within the Amish community. The ads failed to show the film for what it really is: an intelligent love story confined in a thriller. The first half is a tense thriller, but it slowly leads into a believable romance story before turning on the thriller button again. Both parts of the film are excellent! Harrison Ford, who earned an Academy Award nomination, is at his very best here. Trust me, this film is not your typical police thriller.Earl Wallace's and William Kelley's sensitive, endearing script was circling around Hollywood for a few years before being picked up. The script went out of its way to show the Amish culture as real as it can be within the thriller setting. After the film's release, the Amish were very concerned about tourists invading their land. They were also somewhat critical of the script. That said, I loved how the film incorporated the values and traditions of the Amish. This is also Peter Weir's first American film. His direction earned him his first Academy Award nomination. He directed the material with fragile care. He favored substance over style, which is really welcoming in thrillers like these. He and cinematographer John Seale did meticulous research in order to figure out the right look for the movie. They definitely found it! The barn-raising scene is a beautiful scene. It shows us so much about the Amish and they used camera/lighting perfectly.Samuel (Lukas Haas), an eight-year-old and his mother, Rachel (Kelly McGillis) are an Amish family on their way to Philadelphia to visit Rachel's sister. Samuel witnesses a murder in the bathroom stalls. The murdered man was an undercover cop, so homicide detective John Ball (Harrison Ford) is sent to investigate. He quickly discovers that the murder was from Ball's own department. Ball is the latest target from the murderers. He escapes from them and goes with Rachel to her Amish family. Although Amish law forbidden them to fall in love, they begin to fall in love as John is learning the customs of the Amish. Sooner than later, the cops figure out where John is hiding. He and his new Amish family may not be safe.People generally agree that this role is Harrison Ford's best...and I wholeheartedly agree. Of course, he is awesome in Star Wars or Indiana Jones, but this performance takes his action prowess and adds vulnerability and sensitivity to it. His chemistry with Kelly McGillis is natural, not forced. To date, this film remains his only Academy Award nomination. Speaking of McGillis, she was a nice find! She did her research and came across in my eyes as a traditional Amish person, even down to that accent. This film marks the first film role for Viggo Mortensen as one of the Amish. Weir said he had a face that resembled an Amish person. Also, in early roles are Danny Glover as one of the crooked cops and Lukas Haas as Samuel.I grew up relatively near Amish territory, so it is really to see a film that celebrates their nonviolent, agriculture-based culture. This is one of the few films about the Amish, so I am grateful for a film like this. Did you know that Maurice Jarre is an excellent composer? His haunting, memorable score fits the Amish community very well. In fact, I will not hesitate to say that his film score is one of my favorites of the 1980's.I love Witness. It is a beautiful, haunting film. It is a thriller but is also a meditative love story about a forbidden romance. Weir directed each section masterfully and successfully interwoven these parts to create one powerful movie. Harrison Ford is at his best! Kelly McGillis made an excellent romantic pairing for him. You believed the romance between the two characters and there are no kisses for the sake of kisses. Each kiss is meaningful and well-placed. As a thriller, this film absolutely rocks. I do not think I had fingernails until long after the film ended.My Grade: A",Witness
64,Maziun,When two worlds collide,8,31 December 2013,"Witness"" works on 3 levels – as a thriller , drama and romance. The thriller elements of the movie appear at the beginning and the ending of the movie, while the middle of the film is basically a drama with a love story in it. It's an interesting combination and while it might not work for those who like pure thrillers or dramas it certainly worked for me. One has to remember that ""Witness"" is first a electrifying and poignant love story , then the thriller. A romantic thriller.It's a movie worth watching just for the fact that is first and one of the few films to focus on Amish culture. As a kid I would laugh at their philosophy of life . The more and more I'm getting older the more I'm thinking they are right. The Amish way of life has many virtues - they have a deep faith in God , pacifism , sense of community.""Witness"" is a story about cultural clash between two completely different worlds. Both cultures are forced to come together. Each one had to search out the moralities, prejudices and actions of the other. The film is thankfully devoid of easy moralizing.It's an interesting thing that Sylvester Stallone (""Rocky"") and Jack Nicholson (""One flew over the cuckoo nest"") were considered for the role of John Book . While I do believe that they would handle the role very well , I'm happy that Harrison Ford (""Raiders of the lost ark"") got the part in the end. Harrison Ford gives his finest performance in ""Witness"" , the only one which got him an Oscar nomination. Hord walks away from his hero persona (Indiana Jones , Han Solo). His John Book isn't stereotypical cynical and strong cop. His tough enough to be convincing as a city cop , but it's more about his sense of duty and dignity. It's interesting how the film uses Ford's real-life carpenter's talent. Kelly McGillis (""Top gun"") also gives a great and underrated performance , the best in her career. Her Rachel is very sensible and lonely woman , who finds soul mate in Book. Both Ford and McGillis have a wonderful chemistry together . The say much more by the things they don't say (for example the bating scene , the dance scene). The romantic plot reaches it's climax with one of the best on-screen kisses in the history of film. This brief-scene is powerful , sincere and moving. The love story here is beautiful and tragic. Danny Glover(""Lethal weapon"") does a nice job as the bad guy. Who could forget Lukas Haas (""Inception"") as the Amish kid. His cheerful , colorful face is something that can't go unseen. Watch out for Viggo Mortensen (""The Lord of the rings "" trilogy) in his debut as an Amish. Peter Weir gives a brilliant direction . This is a simple story wit heart . Every dramatic moment is powerful and every small scene is important. Weir isn't a action/thriller director , yet he gives us great Hitchcockian set pieces such as the scene in the toilet and the final confrontation in style of ""High noon"" (silo death). The screenplay quite rightfully won the Oscar. The film's script by Earl W. Wallace, William Kelley and Pamela Wallace has become a frequent model for budding screenwriters, often used to display clear structure in a screenplay. It is a film about adults, whose lives have dignity and whose choices matter to them just like it's a story about cops.The soundtrack by Maurice Jarre is good , but I think it would have sounded much better with real orchestra instead of synthesizer. John Searle's cinematography is gorgeous – the scene of raising the barn is cinematic lyricism.Highly recommended. I give it 8/10.",Witness

66,FloatingOpera7,A Genuinely Dramatic And Suspenseful Thriller,10,5 February 2005,"Director Peter Weir's ""Witness"" released in 1985 would become one of a trend of crime/police/detective thrillers that would enjoy success well into the 90's. Harrison Ford is tailor-made for the role of John Book, a tough but sensitive NYC cop. He has played the hero before in such thrillers as Clear and Present Danger etc. An Amish boy, played by Lukas Haas, goes to an station bathroom and accidentally witnesses a murder. The murderer turns out to be none other than a treacherous cop played by Danny Glover, who is out of his usual portrayals of good guys in the movies. Kelly McGillis portrays the boy's widowed Amish mother Rachel. While the film is undoubtedly a thriller dealing with crime, it works on another level, the juxtaposition of two different worlds- the ""real world"" of New York City and of crime and the more peaceful world of the Amish, who shun anything modern- electricity, telephones, televisions. The Mennonites seem to be a bit more moderate and more modern and even in this film it's mentioned. Having tracked down the killer, John Book and the Amish boy must escape and live in hiding in the Amish community.It's said the director and writers spent time in an actual Amish community. I find that a bit hard to believe since they are indeed very suspicious of strangers, but some are quite warm and friendly and don't mind visitors as long as they keep a real distance and don't' mingle or blend. It is actually a bit of fiction to have John Book living among the Amish even apparently falling in love with Rachel. It just didn't work for me. The Amish remain isolated from the world to this day, even though we are now in the 21st century..2005. But this movie is well-written, quite suspenseful and interesting to watch.

Detective John Book (Ford) realizes the danger the Lapps are in, and tries to keep them safe from the killers by hiding them back in Amish country. Ford is great at being controlling but gentle, and the action-packed thrills in Lancaster County makes for some unique intensity. Flaws include forced romance between the detective and distressed mother, while supporting characters are so underdeveloped that it feels like director Weir may have cut out an entire subplot, and Naas' character gradually becomes less and less important as the story progresses.

69,movieguy1021,Witness: 6/10,6,14 December 2003,"While in the midst of shooting the Indiana Jones series, Harrison Ford decided to make Witness, a slow thriller that basically just highlights how good the Amish are and how barbaric most others are. Back in 1985, in its initial release, it could be thought of as escapism entertainment and nothing more, and perhaps it's just the excessive cynicism of the new millennium, but it really seems like Peter Weir is trying to tell us something here. If this movie was released for the first time nowadays, it would just be discarded as propaganda, as it basically is. Once you look past that, though, you'll find Witness is basically another cop thriller, but with a twist to it that actually works.Ford is Detective John Book, your average detective, and he's called into a case where an Amish boy (Lukas Haas) witnesses a murder at a train station. To save his, and the boy's, life, Book moves into the Amish country. He must adapt, obviously, and the movie shifts gears from a good detective story to a slow moving adaptation story. In fact, many times short scenes were inserted into the film that basically reminded us that there WAS a case going on here, it isn't all just the farm.One of the first scenes, the one in which the murder actually takes place, is very tense, all because of the music. Also, towards the end, there is another exciting scene, not because we don't know what will happen, but because of the music. The music is the key to the movie. It sets the tone and makes the overlong middle more tolerable, and it very haunting throughout, adding a thin layer of suspense to much of the movie.However, the main problem lies in the script. William Kelley and Earl W. Wallace's script has so many one-dimensional characters and throw-away subplots, especially the main one about Book's romance with Rachel (Kelly McGillis), which is about as thin as Lara Flynn Boyle after going on the Subway diet. Many secondary characters are barely talked about and yet come into play later. One thing I didn't understand is how come everyone seemed to use such strong accents yet they've been living in America for a long time.Also, although I may not be the end-all, be-all of Amish knowledge, it seems like for people so strict in their rules, they broke them easily. They didn't seem to object to riding in trains or cars, or even using technology. What they did have at their houses did seem rather advanced for these, for lack of a better word, primitive people. The middle of the movie seemed to drag on a bit; better editing could have been done.Overall, if you are thinking about seeing Witness, see it for the music, which IS the movie.My rating: 6/10Rated R for some language, violence, and brief nudity.",Witness
70,Min111,He's a witness,7,20 March 2021,"I made a decision to see the movie (Witness) because I somehow knew I'll like it. I was correct. I liked the movie so much that I decided to see the movie again and again. But it's not better compared to the first time around since 'Witness' is a 'thriller' movie. When watching the movie for the first time, you don't know what's going to happen, and you're feeling excited. When watching the movie for the second time, you now know what's going to happen, and don't feel excited as much. I still liked the movie with repeated viewings. Those watching the movie for the first time would ask why they haven't seen it sooner though. I heard of the movie (Witness) for a long time, but I just didn't want to see it for reasons I don't know. I deeply regret it. What's worse is that Harrison Ford is in the movie (Witness), and he's a very good and popular actor among many people. We all know the movies he participated in. Do they even need mentioning? I think not. Anyway, Harrison Ford was the right person to be in the movie. He was the reason why 'Witness' was good to watch. 'Witness' needs to be more appreciated. Harrison Ford is John Book who's the main character in the movie. John Book is a detective. He's been assigned a case. His job is to protect a child named Samuel Lapp who has witnessed a murder. I really like Samuel. He looks so adorable and innocent. Samuel has a mother named Rachel Lapp who looks very beautiful too. I'm impressed with the casting, and the producers were spot on in that regard. I was upset though with the passing away of Samuel Lapp's father at the beginning where you see the funeral happening. The father name is Jacob Lapp. There was no need for that though. 'Witness' would've been more better had we gotten to see Samuel's father entirely. I'm sure the movie would've received an even higher rating. Anyway, Samuel goes into the men's room, and he witnesses a brutal murder by a couple of bad men. They were, in fact, corrupt police officers. Luckily, Samuel manages to evade detection. I thought Samuel was very brave and smart - you need to see the movie what I mean. I guess Samuel was at the 'right' or 'wrong' place at the 'right' or 'wrong' time - you choose! I really felt for Samuel though that he had to see such a thing. I don't understand why Rachel will let her son just walk into the men's room like that because he was eight. Rachel should've walked with him to the men's room. I'm not saying she should've gone in the men's room. She should've just waited outside the men's room instead of remaining seated if you see the movie. Anyway, Samuel saw one of the faces of the men that killed an undercover police officer it seems. John Book questions Samuel regarding what he witnessed. That was a pivotal moment. John Book also has a partner named Elton Carter who assists him on the case. John Book orders his partner to do something because he now knows Rachel and Samuel are in danger. John Book drives Rachel and Samuel back to their community. I found the Amish community rather very interesting. John Book relationship with the Amish community deepens if you see the movie. 'Witness' is a 'thriller' movie, but there also 'romance' which is the other popular movie genre. Yes, John Book and Rachel Lapp are drawn to each other. Harrison Ford is great with women it appears if you see his movies. 'Witness' is a very old movie now. It's an eighties movie. I usually think eighties movies aren't worth watching because they're old or something. Yes, the nineties have their share of many great movies, but the eighties also have its share of many great movies. 'Witness' is one of them. I'm glad I seen 'Witness'. I wish to have seen the movie sooner. The movie rightfully has a good overall rating here. I'm surprised Harrison Ford has been continuing doing movies even till today. 'Witness' is one his many terrific movies out there. No, 'Witness' is not an overrated movie.",Witness

72,Eumenides_0,"A Thriller, a Love Story",9,8 April 2009,"Witness is one of the most sensitive and well-written crime movies I've ever seen. The crime itself is mundane: an Amish boy witnesses the gruesome murder of an undercover cop; Detective John Book investigates and finds out corruption inside the police; he runs for his life and hides amidst the Amish.What is fascinating is the several contrasts between city life and country life, between the peacefulness of the Amish and the violence of Book's world, between his loud personality and the shyness of the Amish. Its about community. It's also how violence can affect peoples' lives; and more importantly it's a beautiful love story.Peter Weir is a filmmaker who seldom disappoints: I've enjoyed his work in The Year of Living Dangerously, Dead Poets Society, The Truman Show, and Master & Commander. But for me Witness is his masterpiece. It's built on simplicity, sharp writing, tight editing, beautiful cinematography, inspiring music, and powerful performances by the cast. Harrison Ford shows what a great actor he can be. Kelly McGillis gave the performance of her life as an Amish widow starting a conflict with her community as she falls in love with an outsider. Danny Glover, Josef Sommer, Lukas Haas and Jan Rubes complement the cast wonderfully.Technically speaking, this movie is excellent. Maurice Jarre, who passed away recently, composed one of his finest scores ever, which suits the images many times. There's especially a sequence in which the whole community raises a barn and I'd say half the charm of it comes from the score playing. The screenplay is concise and clear, and Thom Noble's editing doesn't let the story stray once. The cinematography captures the beauty and tranquility of the fields and the grandiosity of the city buildings which leave the Amish awed.Anyone who enjoys cinema for a good story with rounded characters interpreted by great actors can't miss Witness.",Witness

74,MichaelMargetis,"""Listen, lady, you take my picture and I'm going to rip off your brassiere and strangle you with it. "" - John Book",7,13 July 2005,"I saw 'Witness' for the first time last light on AMC (American Movie Channel). I was expecting something really great since it was nominated for 'Best Picture' and won an Oscar for 'Best Original Screenplay'. Well, I have to say a was a little disappointed with it. 'Witness' starring Harrison Ford as a heroic police detective on a mission to save a little boy was a very good movie, but nothing close to being worthy of the Oscar status. It would be like 'Lethal Weapon' (which came out by the way, the same year, and is more deserving of praise) winning an Oscar, it's a good film and fun to watch, but it just isn't in the same league with other films. But then again, 1985 wasn't the best year for films, point in fact it was one of the worst. But just because I don't think 'Witness' should have won an Oscar doesn't mean I think it's a bad movie in the slightest. It's an interesting and mostly entertaining film about a little Amish boy, Samuel (Lukas Haas) who witnesses the of a cop at the hands of a dirty cop named McFee (Danny Glover - Lethal Weapon). The boy and his caring single Amish mother, Rachel (Kelly McGillis - Top Gun) are taken into hiding by the brave, clean and honest police detective John Book (Harrison Ford). They hide out at an Amish plantation, a perfect spot where the dirty cops can't locate them. There Book plays Amish, and milks cows, does carpentry and raises barns. The film makes a transition into the suspenseful crime/drama to a kind of comedy with a romantic love interest between Book and Rachel.You see I enjoyed the beginning of 'Witness' more then what preceded it. It started out a cool dark suspense mystery and turned into Harrison Ford shirtless at the ranch milking cattle or beating up yanks who pick on the poor ole Amish -- ughhh. It was very funny, but I didn't care for the shift of seriousness to stupid silly slapstick in the slightest bit. The ending was a little hokey, but had a great shoot-out scene before hand. The acting in 'Witness' is perhaps the best quality. Harrison Ford gives what is perhaps his finest performance (well, maybe with the exception of 1993's 'The Fugitive') as the determined, loyal and dedicated officer of the law that is John Book. Kelly McGillis is solid as to be expected as Rachel, and young Lukas Haas was nothing short of impressive in the way he handled his role. It was interesting to see Danny Glover, whose usually stuck playing the hapless good guy, playing a ruthless and mean dirty cop. Josef Summer, Alexander Goudonuv, Jan Rubes and Patti Lupone also have parts in the film, and watch out for a small role played by a very young Viggo Mortensen. Peter Weir provides great directing as to be expected and the screenplay is pretty decent (a far cry from Oscar worthy if I may say so) for the genre of this kind of flick. All in all, 'Witness' is a good motion picture despite it's flaws and shortcomings. I recommend you taking the time to watch it if you spot it on television. Grade: B",Witness
75,JakeBrinkman,Fun popcorn entertainment,5,15 November 2019,"A movie doesn't sound very interesting when it has a plot that's as plain as the Amish and only one character (maybe two) that has any depth of personality. Despite that, Witness somehow managed to stay entertaining throughout, probably thanks to its highly unusual premise and Ford's charismatic performance as John Book. It's never exciting, dramatic, or thought-provoking, but it's entertaining nonetheless.",Witness
76,romanorum1,"""You be careful out among the English.""",8,18 June 2013,"After her husband's premature death, a young Amish woman, Rachel Lapp (Kelley McGillis), takes her son Samuel (Lukas Haas) on a train trip to Baltimore. While in the men's washroom at the Philadelphia station, young Samuel witnesses a brutal murder. By his own wits he saves himself from the scary murderer McFee (Danny Glover). Detective John Book (Harrison Ford), summoned to the murder scene, perceives that the dead man is an undercover cop. He questions Rachel and Samuel. From a photograph, Samuel fingers McFee, among others a corrupt cop. McFee had stolen large quantities of a chemical substance used in the manufacture of methamphetamine. The bad guys try to set up Book for a hit, but fail (although he is wounded by McFee). Now searched by the bad guys, Book goes into hiding in Pennsylvania German (Amish) country (Lancaster County, PA) to blend in with the religious sect.The middle part of the movie, and by far the greater segment overall, is the focus on the Amish community. This section is almost a documentary. We learn that the Amish shun the new ways, and live much as they did in the eighteenth century. Unlike the nearby Mennonites, the Amish reject automobiles, electricity, and telephones. Gas lamps are used. The Amish ride in traditional horse and buggy units while heavy traffic passes them by (when they can). They wear plain clothes and use hooks and eyes, rather than buttons or zippers, which they consider proud and vain. There is a nice barn-raising scene, where the Amish people together erect a barn within one day for a newly married couple. We see how the tourists think about the Amish, and Book's reaction to human pests. There is the obvious clash between the modern (Book-urban) and the olden (Rachel-rural) ways. Nevertheless, as Book outwardly becomes part of the Amish community, Rachel and he begin to draw closer. The sponge bath scene is probably the most notable one in the movie. If John and Rachel decide to come together, one of them will have to give up his/her ways, for there is no middle ground. What will happen? Meanwhile three bad cops, including corrupt Chief Schaeffer (played by Josef Sommer) and McFee, track down their quarry and arrive in Amish country to do in Book. So the final scenario is the shootout between the good and the bad. What will the peaceful Amish people do? Perhaps not what you may expect! The acting is very good all-around. Harrison Ford may have given us his best performance here as a decent cop (who does not overact), although others may opt with justification for ""The Fugitive"" or the ""Indiana Jones"" series. Kelley McGillis makes a fine and dedicated Amish lady. Jan Rubes plays moral kingpin Eli Lapp, while Danny Glover is indeed chilling as a bad cop. The subtleties / expressions of the actors work so well. For instance, Lukas Haas's bewildered face when he spots McFee's photo in the police station speaks volumes. Of course, the looks of Mc Gillis and Ford during the famous sponge bath scene do not require a word of dialog. See this movie more than once.",Witness

What feels a familiar crime thriller is a treat for the tremendous treatment it receives.Avoiding the gimmicky clichés and using minimal dialogues, the film mesmerizes through its style and execution. And the best part is more pleasure you find in the repeated viewings. Apart becoming better than the cliched crime thrillers, it can be watched as a story of human relations or a superb depiction of an Amish community, which has been seldom seen in Hollywood, or simply for the brilliant performances and a tremendous cinematic experience.

78,roghache,Memorable scenes and themes in a romantic thriller,9,10 March 2006,"This is a fabulous romantic thriller, with Harrison Ford at his most magnetic as the hardened big city detective, John Book, and Kelly McGillis portraying his Amish love interest, Rachel Lapp. This movie has broad appeal with both plenty of suspense and action but also a tender romance.The plot revolves around a lovely young Amish widow, Rachel, and her young son, Samuel, who are traveling from Pennsylvania's Lancaster County to Baltimore, where they will visit her sister who may help heal her grief in the recent loss of her husband. At the Philadelphia train station washroom en route, Samuel is the sole eyewitness to the murder of an undercover narcotics officer, and John Book is the detective assigned to the case. Naturally the young boy must be protected from the killer, so Detective Book accompanies Samuel and his mother to Amish country which they hope will serve as a retreat. However, the villains are hot on their heels. Needless to say, John and the young widow soon develop a mutual, though necessarily restrained, attraction.This film is ripe with conflict, and not simply the hero of the piece trying to evade pursuit by the killers. John faces inner struggle in his forbidden attraction to this Amish woman. Rachel in turn is also conflicted, torn between the exacting standards of her moral Amish background versus her worldly desires and passions...a dilemma that comes to be dramatically represented by her simple white Amish cap.In terms of scenes, there is drama, comedy, and romance. It's certainly a dramatic moment when young Samuel identifies the killer from a book of photos and Detective Book comes to realize the significance of this killer's identity. Amusing pictures include Rachel's father, Eli, giving John instructions on the finer points of milking a cow, not to mention John's unforgettable response to some tourists who are mocking the Amish. As for romance, John struggles with temptation when, in a very erotic moment, he inadvertently sees Rachel taking a sponge bath. There is also a beautiful, touching sequence where the pair are dancing in a barn, wonderful chemistry and sexual attraction, but restraint.As to themes, this film paints a portrait of Amish life with its horse and buggy travel, lack of telephones and electric lights, as John is introduced by Rachel and Eli to a lifestyle and values completely alien to him. Likewise, Eli must deal with the threat of the outer world intruding upon his household, with the sudden arrival of the city detective. It contrasts the peaceful Amish ways to the worldliness and especially the violence of the society outside. The sense of community among the Amish is portrayed through a barn raising sequence, also their very dramatic method of communication (I won't give it away) when a member of the the community requires help from the neighbors. Finally, we have in this story of two people from very different worlds that fall in love. Rachel already has a would be Amish suitor named Daniel, who has set his cap for the young widow. For her and John to build a life together, one or the other of them would be forced to completely give up his / her world and live totally in the other's.The young boy, Samuel, in his black coat and hat, is quietly and charmingly played by Lukas Haas. The actor is probably best remembered even today for this childhood role. A high recommendation to this incredible suspenseful and touchingly romantic movie, with its engaging plot, Amish backdrop, conflicted cultures, wonderful music and cinematography.",Witness
79,steiner-sam,"The best of the ""Amish"" movies",9,28 June 2021,"This is a crime drama set in 1984 Philadelphia and Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. In many ways, this movie became the standard by which all subsequent ""Amish"" movies have been judged.Recently widowed Rachel Lapp (Kelly McGillis) takes her son, Samuel (Lukas Haas), to visit her sister on a trip to Baltimore. They are to change trains in Philadelphia, but the train is delayed. Samuel witnesses the murder of an undercover police officer in the restroom. Detective John Book (Harrison Ford) leads the investigation along with his partner Elton Carter (Brent Jennings).Samuel identifies Detective James McFee (Danny Glover) as the killer. Book tells his boss, Paul Schaeffer (Josef Sommer), about his suspicions. When soon attacked and seriously wounded by McFee, Book realizes that Samuel and Rachel are also in danger, and he takes them to their home, which is shared with Rachel's father-in-law, Eli Lapp (Jan Rubes).Rachel nurses Book back to health as they begin to recognize their feelings for one another. Book begins to dress Amish and participates in activities like a barn raising, though his continued presence generates criticism within the Amish community. Rachel's prospective Amish suitor, Daniel Hochleitner (Alexander Godunov), is also dismayed by Book's continued presence. After Book learns his partner has been killed and gets himself involved in a confrontation with some ""English"" in town, Schaeffer comes looking for him along with McFee and Detective Ferguson (Angus MacInnes).There is a final violent confrontation. Through the experience, both John Book and Rachel Lapp realize they need to return to their own worlds.This was the first ""serious"" Amish movie that has been imitated multiple times since by Lifetime Movies, Hallmark Movies, and a few others. In my mind, this remains the best of the lot for the quality of the cinematography, the storyline, and the general respect for the Amish culture.Yes, there are problems. Eli Lapp has a strange silo attached to his barn with no corn on the bottom. The use of ""shunning"" in the storyline misrepresents the process that would be followed in any shunning. Hochleitner's pursuit of Rachel so soon after her husband died (he basically first approaches her the day of the funeral) is odd, as is Rachel's lack of grief within weeks. The general ""look"" of the Amish and the Lancaster countryside seems of good quality, though the Amish women always show too much hair. The treatment of the Amish reaction to Book's handgun is OK, but Amish farmers would often have rifles or shotguns to deal with pests on the farm, and some Amish would hunt. Firearms are not forbidden, although violence against people is.I think the cast performed the characters very well -- including Harrison Ford, Kelly McGillis, Jan Rubes, and especially Lukas Haas.",Witness
80,Med-Jasta,Realistic action movie,10,26 May 2020,"I don't even know if action is the right word. I guess a drama is more accurate. I like that a lot is going on in this movie that doesn't really mean anything. Book isn't a guy who can't live without technology and learns something about himself by living with the Amish. They set up that Book needs a kid and a wife but he doesn't get with the girl at the end. Things like that. Makes it feel very real.The romance happens but neither is going to leave their life which I liked. And they don't talk about it, it's all on their face. Because Ford is an amazing actor. I didn't real realize that until this movie. Of course he was good in everything I'd seen him in but it felt like he was acting. Which is a sign of a good actor. I grew up with him in my favorite movies never thinking he was good or not or looking at his acting closely. But he is one of the best. This movie is a good showcase.I really like that you get the gunfight at the end. Which again isn't done ""Amish style,"" but that the way it ends is confronting the bad guy with his own method. He's not going to kill all those people. He doesn't want to and he wouldn't be able to. It's very realistic and unexpected. Book appealed to his own humanity and won.I wish the music wasn't so 80s. It's fine music but didn't really fit the movie.I like that the Amish were handled with good taste. The movie doesn't make fun of them or defend them either. They stick to their rules but have a sense of humor. Like during the milking scene, the father in law gets and laughs at the teet joke.Of course I look at all of their things and see the contractions and wonder how they live like this.",Witness
81,mmallon4,Don't Give This One Amish,9,12 April 2021,"Any public fascination with the Amish and their stark contrast with the modern, civilized world sadly translates more than often to the group being the butt of jokes in movies, sitcoms and oddly enough, many TV commercials (look it up). Regardless of how accurately Witness represents the Amish, it's as serious and as comprehensibly researched as Hollywood has ever taken the subject matter (customs, language, dialect and all) - a human portrayal without any condescension. Witness is the story of an Amish community being forced to cooperate with the outside world after a young Amish boy is a material witness to a homicide. The expertly paced story neatly falls into the classic heroes' journey, as police detective John Book (Harrison Ford) has to leave the world he knows to take refuge in the unfamiliar but eventually has to set things right in his world.Witness was Harrison Ford's opportunity to showcase his acting chops playing a contemporary, real-world character as John Book, the upstanding figure of morality in a world of police corruption. Ford projects much warmth with his interactions with the little Amish child Daniel (Lukas Haas), posing as a Freudian father figure, while Ford's trademark dry wit never fails to amuse (""learning a lot about manure, very interesting""). Early in the film there is a scene in which Daniel mistakes a Rabbi for an Amish man, this is the reverse of a gag from another Harrison Ford movie, The Frisco Kid, in which Gene Wilder plays a Rabbi who mistakes an Amish man as being a fellow Rabbi. Kelly McGillis on other hand has that country girl look and conveys a sense of purity to the character of Rachael. The forbidden love she shares with Book builds up the sexual tension between the two, most memorably during the sequence as the pair dance by Book's car to the song Wonderful World by Greg Chapman (I've never seen anyone drink lemonade more manly than Harrison Ford) - This repressed longing is far sexier than any sex scene could ever be.The mid-1980's was a period when real-world dramas featured futuristic, synth music scores. Maurice Jarre's score for Witness wouldn't feel out of place in Blade Runner but the odd combo of futuristic-sounding music over the rural landscapes of Pennsylvania is effective (likewise, that barn construction sequence may lack the dancing from Seven Brides For Seven Brothers but is no less splendid). It's just ironic that this music is juxtaposed to a world in which modern technology is shunned.One of the most interesting scenes in Witness is that in which an Amish elder speaks to Samuel about Book's gun, tying in with the film's broader theme of pacifism vs. Conflict. In what could be seen as an anti-gun argument from the Amish perspective, the elder states ""this gun of the hand is for the taking of human life"" and that it is only for God to take life. Samuel however, who has witnessed a man being murdered, refutes this and states ""I would only kill a bad man"". The film presents two sides of an issue without taking a side or being propagandistic, letting the viewer draw their own conclusion.",Witness

Well written, maybe a few dull dialogs and a couple of dull and forced situations (an important and dull plot turn) there is no complains about it good quality. It's also very entertaining. We have a sight of the Amish world, which however isn't so truthful to reality in the film, still being interesting. Harrison Ford brings arguably one of his best performances in his career, as the irresponsible detective which decides to once in his life being a responsible person, with compromises. The cinematography is also very good. The film was shot on location in Philadelphia and the city and towns of Intercourse, Lancaster, Strasburg and Parkesburg. I just find a problem. I didn't felt so involved with the characters. Their development is not the one which priority is to set the characters, but the story. So i didn't cared that much about the characters.

The setting was outstanding, the suspense was real, the characters were relatable, and everyone did very well in their respective roles. A young Amish boy is a witness in a murder case and only Book (Ford) can protect him and the boy's mother. It's not too violent if you don't count the blood but I wouldn't recommend showing it to very young children. Try showing it to some teenage audiences and maybe they'll understand more about the Amish, though some things may be exaggerated a bit. But that's typical of most movies. Though I really liked Ford's portrayal of Han Solo and Indiana Jones, this was one of his more realistic roles as a police detective determined to fight to save an innocent child while keeping the child's own people from harm.

84,I_Am_The_Taylrus,An Impressive Film(SPOILERS),9,17 February 2007,"SPOILERS I was very impressed by this film. Actually, I had never even heard of Witness until a couple hours ago. It sounded familiar, but I just could not put my finger on it. Anyway, this is an incredible film. It had terrific acting, and an amazing musical score. I mean, there was happy and cheery music, and there was also a suspenseful and tense piece of music. This film also had one of the best climaxes I have seen in a while.Here is the plot of this film. A young Amish boy sees a grisly murder by two people in a bathroom stall. A detective named John Book tries to help the young boy find the the killer that the boy had seen. Then they discover that it was an officer named McFee. John tells the police chief. It turns out that the chief was in cahoots with McFee. John realizes that they are in cahoots and him, the boy, and his mother flee to an Amish farm. John tries to live like an Amish person. Then John finds out that his friend had been murdered. The chief, McFee, and the other person involved in the murder named Fergie track them down and try to kill them. John kills Fergie and McFee, and the chief gives up. In the end John leaves the farm.Overall, this is a very impressive film. It had great acting, great suspense, a great score, and very good cinematography. Harrison Ford, who plays John, is always good in his movies and I think that he definitely should have won Best Actor at the Academy Awards. I also think that this film should have won Best Score. This is a fantastic and unique film that should not be missed. I was very surprised with this film, and I think that it should be in the Top 250 here on IMDb. It definitely deserves to be up there. This is an amazing and suspenseful film that also has fantastic performances by everyone in this film.

""Witness"", the film itself, is like its title: Stunning, clear, and heartfelt.

So is the love scene that Book and Rachel have and the musical score by Maurice Jaffe captures that scene very well. Another scene that I liked very much was the construction of barn for an Amish couple that just got married.The showdown that Book has against Schaffer and the two cops is well-done and the timing is near perfection. How the showdown ends with a few other Amish families come to see what has happen and some of the looks (on their faces) shows Schaffer that he should surrender peacefully.Ford gives a great and solid performance as Book, but Haas manages to steal most of the scenes that he's in very well.

86,higherall7,Murder down on the Farm...,8,7 June 2021,"Harrison Ford took time between fighting Aliens and running around in search of ancient artifacts to serve up this smart, thought provoking detective thriller. Here he is as John Book doing witness protection incognito in Amish country. A young child's life unexpectedly hangs in the balance in a strange and violent culture clash. Book meanwhile finds he has to go it alone and off the record to handle this case. Before long, he finds himself spiriting away Rachel Lapp and her young son Samuel in the dead of the night to keep them safe from corrupt cops on his own force.Kelly McGillis has never been more wholesomely beautiful and is entirely believable as the recently widowed Rachel Lapp. She calls to mind with her performance the newly minted bride Amy Fowler as played by Grace Kelly in HIGH NOON (1952). It is reported she actually did spend time with an Amish widow and her seven children, learning their accents and how to milk cows. Harrison Ford as well spent time with the Philadelphia Police Department, learning the ins and outs of being a detective in their homicide department. Due to their physical parity, and the complimentary nature of their temperaments, the romantic chemistry between them is apparent from the outset.Danny Glover here makes a marvelously villainous heavy as Lt. James McFee, out for Book's scalp and to silence Lucas Haas as little Samuel Lapp who inadvertently saw too much. Helping him bring up the rear in diabolical menace is Josef Sommer as Chief Paul Schaeffer and Brent Jennings as Det. Sgt. Elton Carter. The showdowns between Book and these culprits are brought off with deft touches of realism and authenticity, while John Book's convalescence and stay with the Amish compels us to contemplate the virtues and efficacious nature of violence versus non-violence. The pacifist nature of the Amish community is highlighted without any particular grandstanding from Alexander Godunov as Daniel Hochleitner or Jan Rubes as Eli Lapp, or many of the Mennonites who stood in as extras for the Amish men who declined to take a part in the film. While the corruption of Big City cops as bordering on the feral is on full display.The barn raising for a recently married Amish couple is a brilliant set piece by director Peter Weir. It made me feel as though I were inside a moving painting by one of the 17th Century Dutch Masters, as I believe was Weir's intent. This proves to be a valid payoff from Weir and his cinematographer John Seale visiting the Philadelphia Museum of Art, and you can see the influence of the paintings of Johannes Vermeer in other scenes of the film. The way Book is welcomed into the Amish community to ply his carpentry skills for the barn raising, even though he and Daniel Hochleitner are somewhat rivals for Rachel affections, is also a pleasant affirmation of the Amish way of life. Later on, Book will make his own affirmation of the Big City lifestyle which brings the narrative to its climax.The film did well at the box office, albeit the Amish communities where it was shown did not receive it favorably. The consensus was that the portrayal of the Amish people was not accurate, and it was boycotted by the The National Committee For Amish Religious Freedom as fears were cited that it would lead to these communities being overrun by tourists, among other considerations. But the film itself was nominated for Academy Awards in eight separate categories, including Best Actor for Harrison Ford, Best Director for Peter Weir and Best Musical Score for Maurice Jarre. It did indeed win for Best Original Screenplay and Best Film Editing. It may cause you deliberate as to whether or not shared cultural values are more important than the heat of passion, and the simple act of witnessing evil more important than the gun of the hand.",Witness
87,Hallelujah289,"Came for dirty cop thriller, got idyllic Amish romance",6,18 March 2019,"I'm feeling a little uncharitable here because of the rather glowing reviews ""Witness"" seems to have, but for me there was something pretty lukewarm about this film. What drew me to watch Witness was the unusual combination of detective and Amish, but I had an expectation for more detective and less Amish, and it turned out to be the other way around.What I mean is I expected a thriller and I got more of an idyllic portrait with an unlikely romance and a side of action. I sometimes watch five hour long videos of train rides through Norway so I'm no stranger to slow television but it felt odd to have such a meandering look into Amish life in the middle of a manhunt. ""Witness"" is strangely peaceful for a thriller. I got to see Harrison Ford make a wooden toy, repair a car, milk a cow, build a barn, install a bird house, pet kittens, etc etc. I mean that's interesting in itself, but. . . Where's the flying bullets and a look into the life and crimes of dirty cops and the throat punching and the actual hunting and police work. It does happen but it feels like only after long poetic interims.I feel like the romance between Harrison Ford's detective John Book and the Amish woman Rachel (whose son he is supposed to protect as a key witness to a murder committed by a dirty cop) is only inserted into the story as filler to hold interest. Nothing against the actress and the communication style of potent silences and meaningful glances (and later, boobs) but I thought the relationship was rather wooden and lacking motivation or chemistry. Rachel did not really seem to have that look of romantic feeling or palpitation much although of course the camera work implies it with its attention on Harrison Ford sweaty lemonade drenched neck etc. Ford on the other hand does have a warm expression sometimes and he of course can be a winning lover (Star Wars!) but I did not quite sense the reason for his reciprocation because Rachel did seem pretty dull and half taken.Why am I talking at length about a love story in an Amish detective dirty cop corruption film anyway? ""Witness"" is puzzling because it's like three films in one but it doesn't all quite go together. Ford is likeable enough to carry off a large part of the film but I think without his charm I don't imagine the film to be half as successful.If you want a romance served on glances I recommend ""Girl with a Pearl Earring"" which has a similar emphasis on the beautiful and the old style. Mostly though the relationships are more electric.If you want to see Harrison Ford get to turn up his rogueish charm then there's definitely other films like his Indiana Jones.Then for cop dramas there's ""The Departed,"" and there's probably even an Amish mystery I haven't discovered that's more flavorful.For all it's genres there's really better out there and ""Witness"" isn't really a great success at any of them though it does manage to be decent. If you are interested in this film it is likeable and easy to watch, as well as being a good effort at something uncommon. But don't hold your breath. . . Unless of course you are a cop trapped in a corn silo, then it might be a very good idea.",Witness
88,antagonist117,"""Witness"" makes a feint at originality but quickly lapses into lazy predictability",3,10 November 2014,"It's not often that movies are made about the Amish, so it's especially disappointing that ""Witness"" is such lightweight fluff. It starts off promising enough, with an interesting character and a strong hook: a young Amish boy on his first trip to the city is the only witness to a grisly murder that happens just feet in front of him. Oddly, though, he and his young, widowed mother seem unaccountably calm about the event, and their only concern is that the police investigation causes them to miss their train. This isn't because they're secretly involved or anything like that; it's because they're stunningly underwritten. Unfortunately, the plot fares no better than the characters. After the boy identifies a police officer as the murderer, a predictable twist requires the lead investigator, Harrison Ford, to go into hiding with the witness and the mother. When Ford's stereotypical hardass cop, who has the distracting name of Book (a reference to the Good Book? to booking criminals?), finds himself confined to an equally stereotypical Amish community that doesn't cotton to his citified ways, it becomes eye-rollingly obvious where the movie is heading. Book and the young widow grow unaccountably close—maybe she likes short-tempered city slickers, and maybe he likes women whose life experiences have no overlap with his own—as they take part in all three of the recognizably Amish events outlined in Weird Al Yankovic's parody about the sect. The ostensibly crucial witness is off-screen for these activities, which include barn-raising, being bullied by townies, and milking cows. Book, of course, comes to respect these people in spite of their different way of life, and they come to respect him despite the fact that he's given to violence, corrupts the young widow, brings mortal danger to their community, and uses the child as a meat shield. An obligatory near-kiss, an obligatory lecture from a paternal figure, and an obligatory actual kiss later, it's finally time for the shootout sequence in which, no kidding, the Harrison Ford character emerges triumphant. He receives assists from a cow patty, a grain silo, and the fact that his foes apparently arrive without a plan. The movie's Amish setting is never more than the skin on a bare-bones, by-the-numbers Ford thriller. Amish ideas about morality are introduced but never come into play. The simplicity of ""Witness""'s plot and characters would make it a good training film for a child of the witnesses's age, but the kid is barely around and the language and occasional deaths of the adults are perhaps too harsh for that set. Ford is asked to do nothing out of the ordinary for him, and his Best Actor win, his very nomination even, is one of the mysteries of Oscar history.",Witness
89,HelloTexas11,Ford goes Amish,7,18 February 2008,"'Witness' was Harrison Ford's first starring mainstream hit drama, after the Star Wars trilogy, two Indiana Jones flicks, and of course 'Blade Runner.' It showed he could carry a conventional story, in this case a cop thriller in an unusual setting, outside the sci-fi/action genres and launched a movie career that by some accounts is the most successful ever. Samuel Lapp (Lucas Haas), a young Amish boy, is on a rare trip to the big city (Philadelphia) with his mother Rachel (Kelly McGillis). There he is the sole witness to a brutal murder and both he and Rachel are detained by police officer John Book (Ford) for questioning. This leads Book to uncover massive corruption in the police department and he himself is almost killed for discovering it, which leads the three of them back to the Amish community where Book hides out while recovering from his gunshot wound and trying to figure out what to do next. Beyond the inspired novelty of having a crime thriller largely set among the Pennsylvania Amish, 'Witness' is memorable for several noteworthy performances. Lucas Haas, like Heather O'Rourke in 'Poltergeist', is one of those child actors who is almost too endearing for words, not only angel-faced but a natural and believable performer. As Rachel, Kelly McGillis has one of her best roles and gives it a multi-layered interpretation. One can sense just below the surface a resentment in her at her lot in life as an Amish woman. Rachel dutifully goes through the motions required by her position but it is obvious she is forever wondering what it would be like to live in the outside world. Or, in Book's case, to bring him in to live in hers. And Harrison Ford gives another of those performances where you wonder where the actor ends and the character begins. Book and Rachel build up a subtle rapport, where thoughts and feelings are simply understood rather than openly expressed. They even manage a low-key teasing kind of back-and-forth, not easy when they are under the constant scrutiny of the town elders and in fact, just about all of the other Amish. 'Witness' provides a glimpse into Amish society that seems genuine and well-detailed. They are portrayed as industrious, self-sacrificing, extreme pacifists who live apart from the outside world, the world of the 'English,' as they call everyone else, regardless of background. Along with these admirable qualities, it is also suggested that they can be small-minded, gossipy, and somewhat smug and defensive about their beliefs and way of life. When one considers the cloistered, confined life they lead, this shouldn't be surprising; one might compare the Amish village to any small American town where everyone knows everyone else and people are forever talking behind each other's back. An interesting subplot in all this is how the Amish's pacifism comes into play when faced with violence. It is obviously a deeply-held belief that some will find admirable and others unfathomable. At one point, Samuel's grandfather attempts to explain to him why they feel the way they do, using Book's gun as a reference, since it epitomizes the evil of taking another's life. The grandfather asks Samuel if he would kill anyone, and the boy responds, ""I would only kill the bad man."" Then the old man asks how Samuel can know who is bad and who isn't. The boy responds, ""I can see what they do. I have seen it."" So the question that hangs in the air is, does Samuel become corrupted from what he's seen, or has he simply been exposed to the real world and become better able to deal with it, even at his young age? It is a question that 'Witness' doesn't attempt to resolve, and in this case, the ambiguity adds depth to a very thoughtful and satisfying movie.",Witness
90,monkeysgalore,A Beautiful Movie,10,3 December 2019,"As a cop thriller, ""Witness"" works. But it's so much more than that. It gives us some of the best characters on screen, one of the best love stories on screen, and overall an excellent thriller that really makes you think more than most movies in the genre. I got so much more out of it than I expected, and it's my favorite thriller, as well as one of my favorite films.The plot follows a tough Philadelphia cop (John Book), who investigates a murder in a train station bathroom. He finds that there was a witness, a young Amish boy whose mother (Kelly McGillis), was waiting outside. The boy helps out Book, identifying the killer as a cop. Book returns to Amish country with the mother and child in an effort to protect them.The plot is very intricate and thought-out, and it was a nice change of pace from the ""cops chasing drug lords/serial killers"" plots that populate so many movies like this. It's very interesting, and well done.Peter Weir is directing here, and he masterfully helms this project from behind the camera. John Balham was originally considered to do the film, but he dismissed it, and I'm glad he did, as Weir directs with style and flair, managing to paint two different worlds with the city and country settings. He directs the action sequences well, and they appeared realistic and entertaining. He is an expert in his field, and could be considered as one of the most skillful directors for the time.The writers are Pamela Wallace, Earl W. Wallace, and William Kelley, and props to all of them for putting out such a wonderful film. The story is unique and original, and its pacing is great. It moves and flows well, and never lulls or gets boring. The writers crafted and engaging, moving, intense, thrilling, and thought-provoking story, which is well worth your time.The characters are developed almost to a fault, and the scenes in Amish country are so intense and natural. The characters of John Book and Rachel are both very good, relatable characters, and we quickly learn to care about both. They are also very tragic, as they both are people who are initially at home in their respective worlds, but who both want more, and they naturally fall in love. What's tragic is how neither can ultimately escape their respective ways of life in order to be with the other. We especially see this when Book's inability to conform to the Amish ways several times, especially the street fight where he takes on some bullies. We should feel elated and happy that the bullies got what they deserved, but the scene ends with a hollow, unfulfilled feeling, and it only further separates Book from the Amish culture. This is a movie that cares about its characters. This is actually one of the rare instances where I was so engrossed in the characters and love story that I was completely distracted from the main plot, and I actually forgot about the villains, so when they returned for the finale it actually threw me for a second.This is NOT another action-filled, shoot-'em-up action thriller. Action does not punctuate the plot, and aside from the parking garage shootout, street fight, and final shootout, there's really not much else. But those scenes, and the opening murder in the bathroom, have such a raw and visceral feel. They feel authentic, and no one does superhuman things. Bullets and explosions don't fill the screen, and it feels realistic. This is especially true during the final shototout, in which about four people participate, and only 2-3 die. It's a long and tense sequence, and there's no hail of gunfire or flashy moments. It's a cat-and-mouse game, and if people are clumsy and slip up, they die.The movie actually seems very reluctant to display violence, and it actually changed my opinion of its violence by the end. In the beginning we see the violence and think ""Oh here we go, another violent thriller."" Then we're taken out of the city where the violence is, and we're placed in Amish country where we learn to care for the characters and identify with their way of life. Then, once the violence comes, we anticipate it with anxiousness and dread, realizing how it will shatter everything we've seen built up until that point. When we see the villains, we don't just see them as villains, but we realize the violence and hopelessness that they represent. The same thing happens during the street fight as I mentioned, when Book takes on some bullies. We see how little the violence ultimately solved and how it distances people from each other. That really is one of the film's core messages, how unnecessary and terrible violence is, and how it only wrecks lives and situations.Everyone turned in excellent performances. Harrison Ford has center stage, and is captivating as John Book. He always throws himself into this roles, and this is no exception, with Ford demanding our attention through his convincing range and displays of emotion. Kelly Mcgillis shines in what is probably her best role (forget ""Top Gun""), as a loving and caring mother, bound by her family's traditions and ethics. I was also pleased to see Danny Glover, another actor I really like. I first saw him, as many people probably did, in the ""Lethal Weapon"" movies, but his rare villainous performance here was really nice. He is likable as an actor, but he really makes you root against him.Overall, this movie is very well deserving of my 10 star review, and I can't heap enough praise on it. It's an example of masterful filmmaking, and it's intense and thrilling, but also deep and moving, an it should be viewed by anyone calling themselves a movie fan. I actually only wrote this review because I was compelled to because the movie was that good.",Witness
91,Ziya90,This is the story of a cop who is used by a family and his completely unrealistic love affair with a woman,5,28 December 2009,"One of the best thrillers of all times. One of the most exciting thrillers so far. And finally, one of the best movies of all time. Really? Only beautiful cinematography and reposeful atmosphere. Witness is neither a thriller and also nor a romance, but the love affair is totally unrealistic, it is another problem. The murder scene was poor, lack of suspense and uninspiring, even if it is the key scene of the film, or is it? Unbelievably, Peter Weir does not put emphasis on this scene. Imagine, if Hitchcock had shot it. I don't mean Rear Window, talk in general. Harrison Ford goes to the rural area. A cop does not do that, a cop does not serve a family which he tries to protect from the people who pursuit child the witness. Let's say it is a part of his job and he is a good guy. However, they say you stay in our house, you eat, drink and sleep in our house for nothing, so work! This recalls me Shane, but John Book is not a drifter. Towards morning, the father comes, pokes him and says go and milk the cows! By the way, the woman makes fun of him, when he wears the Amish costume. Oh the Amish family. I read that an audience bothered, because thinks that during the film making process, the filmmakers disturbed Amish people. People rave about this family. It seems that they adore them. Why? Why? Why? Sorry, but I just don't get it. It is like if any of them had shot Ford, people would have said it is OK. I did not like those characters at all, not because of their live style or ideas, I am respectful, but because of their attitudes. And the love story (in fact not a love story, it was just one scene!) is extremely unrealistic. The change of this character is extremely unrealistic, she was a woman who wants to get rid of him, made of him, disliked him. An Amish woman does not do that also. What happens to their conservatism? One in a million, yeah one in a million. Therefore, what is the point? Probably, it is to make housewives and women who like soap operas happy. It is an example of typical, cliché, audience-driven approach. The last part is exciting and fun, but that's all. Lastly, my expectations had been completely different. I had supposed that in a rural area, a child witnesses to a murder in the field. Then, Ford comes to there to protect him and his mother, but the murderers harass the family in order to kill the child. Yes, the story in my mind had been something like that. As said there are only two good things in this movie besides Harrison Ford. Cinematography and atmosphere.",Witness

I remember thinking this was a pretty good movie. And of course, my memory was of a movie that was a thriller, and I probably would have rated it 7 based on that.
Well, re-watching it recently, I can't believe how wrong I was in remembering it! Okay, there is a crime that gets committed. And you find out there are dirty cops, and Ford's character must protect the boy. But then the movie completely goes off the rails as soon as they reach the Amish farm, and turns into a sappy love story between the Amish mother of the boy and Ford. Sure, it occasionally reverts back to the cop story and you are reminded of the fact that this Ford's and the boy's life are in danger, but then it goes back again to the delicate dance of love and you forget you are watching a crime movie!
And then when you have the final confrontation, you're expecting Ford to take on an army of dirty cops with his one little revolver, and maybe with some Amish folks to help him out. Nope, it's just three guys, who bumble around and are easily overcome. And then the ending of forbidden love.

94,kyle-cruse,"Great elements, but not a perfect film",8,10 September 2008,"""Witness"" is generally considered a monumental film because of its great depiction of forbidden love and because of Harrison Ford's great performance. For me, this film is good, but far from perfect. It starts off with a great concept, in which Harrison Ford is helping protect an Amish mother and son from assassins after the son witnessed a murder in the restroom at a train station. Once Ford goes to stay with the family in the country, however, the film tends to get a little slow, as it relies too much on the tired-out plot concept of forbidden love and why Ford cannot be with the Amish woman, with whom he has fallen in love. The scenes tend to drag a bit here, and I found myself wanting more excitement and more focus on the assassins and murder case. Ford's performance may have been nominated for an Oscar, but I do not personally believe that was deserved. His performance comes off a bit awkward here, and not entirely appealing. However, the film managed to pick up a little toward the end with more excitement and chase scenes. Not a bad film, but not really a great one either. Had good potential, but not a personal favorite. Of course, I still found it worthwhile and enjoyable in parts, but not necessarily good to see over and over again.*** out of ****",Witness

96,arthurclay,Ford's Oscar worthy performance,10,13 March 2005,"And his most outstanding dramatic performance of his career it puts all his other great great performances to shame. He certainly would have gotten the little gold guy if Amadeus had not also been released that same year. Ford is Detective John Book, a no nonsense, cynical Philadelphia cop who is assigned to work a homicide case involving a narcotics officer being taken down in a train station bathroom with the sole witness being a little Amish boy named Samuel Lapp (Lukas Haas cast perfectly) who saw the policeman killed by two other men. Book believes and rightly so that the killing was committed by drug dealers and he sets out to catch them. The catch is he doesn't figure on the drug dealing killers being cops themselves. When Samuel ID's a fellow boy in blue, Ford tells his good friend and mentor Chief Paul Schaeffer (Joseph Sommer in a top notch showing)who tells him he will take care of everything. Sommer mesmerizes you with his subtle malicious badness while Glover shocks you with his. Book is ambushed and shot by none other than Lieutenant McFee of Narcotics (Danny Glover in his best acting performance ever he is flawless)who is only the tip of the corrupt iceberg departmentally speaking. ""Watch your back Schaeffer is in this too!"" Ford tells his partner and flees with the boy and his attractive mother back to the Pennsylvania farm where they came from and slowly recovers while trying to clear his name and protect them from harm. But the trio of bad cops have other ideas in mind and are dedicated to killing Book and Samuel no matter what it takes or who they have to kill to do it. Book, now a stranger in a far stranger land, must become an Amishman and live like one indefinitely which turns out to be more difficult than originally planned as he falls for Samuel's mother Rachel (Kelly McGillis in her biggest role) and realizes his life can never be the same if he lives long enough to live it. Ford's acting starts off great and keeps getting better with each passing frame. His character is perhaps the most dynamic well fleshed out character in cinema history. Also features the late Alexander Godunov who is terrific and Viggo Mortensen in a small, early screen role. Watched it a thousand times and best drama of 1985.",Witness
97,dkncd,By the Book,8,11 October 2007,"""Witness"" is the story of policeman John Book, who becomes involved in a murder case where an Amish boy is the sole witness. The film features striking scenes and a score that I found enjoyable even though it frequently had synthesizers in it.Harrison Ford is well-suited to the role of John Book, a tough policeman foreign to Amish ways. Kelly McGillis is likewise memorable as Rachel Lapp, the mother of Samuel Lapp, who is well-played by a young Lukas Haas. Danny Glover gives a fine performance as James McFee even though he has few scenes and Josef Sommer was excellent as Paul Schaeffer.There are three elements to the story of ""Witness"". The first is the crime story developed after the murder takes place. The crime story itself is nothing particularly novel, but it is well-developed with tension and propelled by an interesting early twist. After the conflict is developed, the film shelves the crime story in order to develop its two other elements. Specifically, the crime story is put on hold when John Book must hide in the Amish community to avoid the murderers.A love story is developed between Ford and McGillis which is effective and convincing and leads to great moments like the dance scene. The last element of the story is the integration of John Book, a city dweller, into Amish life while he hides. While this leads to some interesting moments like the confrontation in town and also some amusing ones, it also drags the story down at points, especially the ""barn-raising"" scene. Toward the end the crime story is phased back in with an inevitable showdown. This portion of the film was well-done and the film's ending was satisfactory.Ultimately, though, the crime story and thriller elements could have been better developed to make the film more interesting. Viewers looking for an out-and-out crime thriller will doubtless find ""Witness"" boring. This movie isn't a mystery film and has a long stretch with no thrills. However, the film has other elements that help keep the film mostly interesting despite the lack of developments in the crime story.",Witness
98,jake-law123,Harrison Ford is the man!,7,13 April 2014,"I love Harrison Ford, every film he stars in he's a bad ass. This film, I was told was a little different from the adventures of Han Solo/Indiana Jones films. This drama is what gave Harrison Ford his first and only Oscar nomination, which amazes me because he's such a great and iconic actor. Either way it's well earned in this multi award winning drama.After an Amish boy witnesses a murder, special agent John Book, (Harrison Ford) helps him identify the murderer. When they figure it out, his cover is blown and he's forced to go into hiding with the Amish people and their community in order to prove the murderer guilty.I thought the performances by all were very nice. Harrison Ford plays his normal badassness, which i'm fine with. The kid isn't the best, but he isn't bad. His mother, played by Kelly McGillis, is also quite convincing, making you feel sympathy, but also seeing her as very strong willed. A lot of the film after John goes into hiding focuses on him adapting to life as an Amish person, as he learns their ways and finds a whole new respect for them, and adapting a family of his own. The film quickly heats up and cools down when it needs to, giving us our appropriate reveals at the appropriate times, never bs'ing around. The film adds a lot of controversy to John and the mother falling in love, yet realizing their ways are too different, which adds a lot of emotional scenes in the film.The film's score was very nice, it's very well complimented with the lighting and cinematography, which captures very detailed scenes of Amish lifestyle, tourist bus stops, and just about every place it visits, while the music builds tension and on ""certain parts"", makes you just wanna smile.This film, while not a masterpiece, is very solid. Well directed, excellently paced, well acted, and well filmed. I wouldn't called it one of Harrison Ford's best roles, but it's the only one that he got nominated for, (which I still can't believe) but either way it's a very memorable film that is definitely recommended.",Witness
99,movieman-200,Unassuming 80s crime/melodrama with an uncharacteristic human heart,7,30 August 2005,"Peter Weir's Witness (1985) is a disturbing thriller set against the backdrop of an Amish community. When Samuel Lap (Lukas Haas) goes into a Philadelphia railway bathroom to relieve himself, he becomes an accidental witness to a brutal murder. The plot thickens when it is revealed that the murder victim was actually an undercover cop. Samuel's mother Rachel (Kelly McGillis) is understandably shaken and apprehensive about having her son testify as to what he saw. But dedicated cop John Book (Harrison Ford) is not about to give up. He installs Samuel and his mother at his sister, Elaine's (Patti LuPone) home  a move that puts everyone in danger. Book eventually learns that dirty cop, James McFee (Danny Glover) is one of the men Samuel saw committing the crime. An attempt on Book's life leaves him wounded. But by then, Book has taken his witness back to the farm  literally  and is in hiding with Rachel and Samuel until protection can be arranged for the trial. Weir's prowess as a director is suspect during the opening sequences. He seems to be just going through the motions  rarely exploring interesting camera angles or staging techniques. But once the plot moves back to the Amish community there is a definite taut and unsettling atmosphere that settles in and carries the film to its inevitable conclusion.Thank those lucky stars that frame the Paramount trademark mountain that someone at the studio is finally starting to pay attention to the way their DVD's are mastered. After a rather lackluster initial transfer with NO extras, we get a special edition worthy of the moniker. Extensively cleaned up with narrowly a blemish to be seen throughout, this DVD delivers a generally smooth, consistent and accurate film to video presentation that simply sparkles. Colors are dated but nicely balanced. Contrast levels are bang on. Blacks are deep and solid. Whites are clean. The audio has also been cleaned up.

Witness is appealing to both men and women, the reason being that there is a gritty look at inner city police corruption, a sensuous love story, and a rare look at the misunderstood culture of the Amish.I guess this movie could be shown in a high school American culture class. It has plenty of useful information about the Amish that not too many people would know about.The story follows a young Amish boy who has witnessed a murder, and a tough Philadelphia cop(played by Harrison Ford) who is supposed to protect him. There isn't a whole lot of action in this movie, but there are some gritty and suspenseful scenes that add to the excitement of the movie. The clash of culture is interesting and realistic. The love story is also pretty good, as it never becomes a soap opera.The direction by Peter Weir is masterful in Witness. The synthesized music doesn't really fit into the movie, it sounds more like something that would be in a science fiction movie, but the music does have a few high points.If you're looking for a movie with no story and just action, then this isn't the movie for you.

103,blazesnakes9,One of the best thrillers of the 80's.,10,18 February 2016,"Peter Weir's film about culture clash and an a mediation of violence in some of the most dangerous cities in America has culminated into a exciting, original, and even, powerful movie that I think is one of the most entertaining thrillers of the 1980's. That movie is, of course, Witness.Harrison Ford plays a Philadelphia police detective who's assigned to investigate an murder witnessed by a 8 year old Amish boy. In the beginning of the movie, the little kid and his Amish mother, (Kelly McGillis), is on their way to visit the mother's sister in Philadelphia. Once the little boy witnessed and identified the person who's responsible for the murder of a policeman inside the train station's bathroom, Ford realizes that the boy and his mother are in danger of those who do know about the murder. After a short shootout inside a parking garage, Ford is forced to live among the Amish community in order to protect the boy and his mother. Soon enough, he starts to become one of them as he, at one point during the movie, raised a barn and even is greeted more kindly to the locals. But, it isn't long before the bad guys show up to interfere with Ford's relationship with the Amish locals.The movie tells two stories. One is the murder story involving the little kid, which I mentioned above, and the other is a story of forbidden love. Ford and McGillis begins to show affections for the two of them and realized that their love for one another is banned due the Amish standards in the community. The most interesting scene that I like a lot is when, after Ford's character watches Gillis' character bathes alone and is surprised to see him, watching her, the two run into each other arms, confessing their love. Now, some people might think that this scene is corny. But, to tell you the truth, it is not. Their romance is very effective in this very well-told story.Witness is one of the best thrillers, I think, of the 1980's. This is the kind of movie that Alfred Hitchcock would to make if he was still alive. Harrison Ford really does bring all his has into this movie. I was very impressed by how Ford was able to channel his action hero stardom into a more human character. His performance as John Book earned Ford his first and only Oscar nomination. He really deserved the nomination and it would've been something if he did win. Kelly McGillis is also riveting as the little boy's mother. Many people might think of her as a very sensitive person, when in doubt, her character really wants to break out of her culture and into the open world where she wouldn't have to follow in the local standards.I also want to give credit to some of the other actors involved in this movie, including Danny Glover, who plays one of the cops that is involved in the murder and Lukas Haas as the little kid. Haas is, like Ford and McGillis, really does a very good job of portraying Samuel as a kid who's not like any other child actor that I ever saw. I believed him as Samuel from the moment we see him at the Philadelphia train station in the beginning of the movie. We can't really take our eyes off this character and either the other two mentioned above, but that what makes Witness all the more enjoyable. This is a great thriller. See it if you haven't seen it already. ★★★★ 4 stars.",Witness

106,vovazhd,Beautifully crafted film that excels where it matters,8,17 March 2008,"Although Witness is labeled as a crime drama, it spends more time showing us the Amish culture than doing any dirty work. The intriguing contrast between mainstream American society and the elusive Amish culture is the main thing that differentiates Witness from other films. The story involves a police captain named John Book. He obtains a child witness for the homicide of a police officer, but then discovers that other officers were involved in the crime. After being attacked and suffering a bullet wound, he flees into the countryside and submerges into the Amish community.Harrison Ford does a great job as John Book. He has a charismatic and likable personality that suits him perfectly for the role. The Amish characters all look very natural and authentic. I felt that the grandfather made an especially powerful character. The rival officers (acted by Josef Sommer and Danny Glover) take a back seat for most of the film, but are solid characters as well.The cinematography of the film is excellent. An example of good filming easily comes to mind: the segment where the Amish people construct a building. This part made me understand their ambitions. The steady camera pans of the countryside (with a good musical score) are also effective. It really felt like the images pulled me into their world.Witness succeeds where it matters: in creating another world that we rarely imagine throughout our own lives, and allowing us to experience this world as if we were part of it.

Unusually for Hollywood, this feels like a ""small"" film, and it hasn't really dated, to the great credit of everyone involved. It's a neat, tightly-told story of the flight into hiding of Samuel, a young Amish boy (Lukas Haas) who makes an expedition into the big city with his mother Rachel (Kelly McGillis), and there witnesses a brutal murder. In their flight to the safety of their Amish farming community, they pick up baggage – a Philadelphia cop, John Book (a super-charismatic 80's Harrison Ford) – along the way. A damaged Book seeks to protect them by becoming part of their community, and in turn his are the eyes through which we learn about the Amish. But inevitably the ripples his presence make in this serene community spread continually wider, until finally the trouble – and the city - comes to them.The screen chemistry between McGillis and Ford is electric, and you don't feel as if they've been clanged together (as in most modern romances): they were simply walking towards each other from the first. In addition to being a fine romance and a bit of a thriller, it's a window on a closed world, respectfully scripted and shot. It's the least boisterous, and most contemplative piece of Hollywood that I've seen in many years: how often is an alternative vision of America presented, in such a way as to suggest that it may even offer a superior quality of life to that of ""modern"" America? Very rare ingredients indeed. Mind you, I'd expect no less from the director of the surprisingly thoughtful ""Master and Commander"".

109,knucklebreather,Greater than the sum of the parts,8,17 July 2010,"""Witness"" mixes Amish exploitation with a corrupt cop thriller, two core elements that wouldn't seem likely to yield a good and original movie. Making a movie about Amish people is haphazard and, as with ""Witness"" it is often a compilation of clichés (barn raisings, riding in buggies, etc.) that doesn't have much depth, it shows us what we already know about Amish culture but doesn't have any particular insight into it. The corrupt cop plot is a tired one and ""Witness"" has nothing particularly new to add, the story is just about corrupt cops being corrupt. No real depth there either.Despite this, ""Witness"" manages to be pretty good. The pacing is very slow but appropriate, spending the first third of the movie introducing us to Rachel and her son Samuel, two Amish heading to Baltimore when Samuel witnesses a brutal murder that he learns was committed by a Philadelphia cop with connections. Harrison Ford is John Book, the ""good cop"" police captain who inadvertently tips his hand to the bad cops, survives an assassination attempt and has to hide out in Amish country of all places.This movie can be looked at a lot of ways but the consensus seems to be that the basic cop story plot is simply an excuse to put a gritty Harrison Ford character in the bucolic and appealing Amish setting for an hour or so. There he must negotiate an alien culture and deal with the mutual feelings developing between him and Rachel. It is obvious that Ford's excellent natural acting skills carry the movie, easily smoothing over the potential absurdities of the plot. Everyone remembers the barn raising scene, but the moment where Book and Rachel dance in the dimly lit barn to the wonderfully slow cover of ""(What a) Wonderful World"" is a stunning and excellent scene, perfectly capturing the emotion between the two characters in a way just about everyone in the audience should be able to fondly relate to.The directer does a good job of showing you the way of life of the Amish (or at least, his version of it) without hammering you over the head with it, and Harrison's low-intensity acting is the perfect match for that. Sure these aren't real Amish people by any stretch of the imagination, but it's a Hollywood movie, what were you really expecting?The result of this is that a bunch of potential cinematic duds just happen to work right. The generic cop story is just interesting enough to hook you in to the charmingly exploitative adventures of Indiana Jones in Amish Country. This movie is not particularly deep, the Amish on screen probably don't accurately depict real-life Amish, but it is still a very enjoyable and fun movie to watch.",Witness

I had been aware of it in terms of the title and Harrison Ford, but had never actually read up on the plot. I am very glad that I watched it. This film is so much more than the crime/legal drama that I had imagined it to be.The directing, cinematography, screenplay and acting are all wonderfully executed. The contrast between the overt, aggressive world of police and murder investigations in the city with the subdued, understated world of the Amish, is exceptionally well portrayed.Harrison Ford does a fine job in his role. The single most beautiful performance, though, is Kelly McGillis. As other reviews have noted, she does not have an excess of spoken dialog, but her physical acting, in particular her eyes and face, is incredibly evocative and moving. If anyone should have gotten a nomination, it should have been her. Watching her play this role was a revelation to me. One also has to credit the great performance of the then-very-young Lukas Haas. His impressive turn may be as much a true key to this film's success as any other single element. The rest of the characters are well-cast themselves.I greatly admired the ending to this film. I think that it speaks to Peter Weir's directatorial sensibilities. In the hands of a lesser director, it could have been far more clichéd, but far less powerful.

111,Hotwok2013,"""Witness"" is another Harrison Ford winner.",10,11 December 2013,"In this move away from the Indiana Jones/Star Wars movies, Harrison Ford comes up trumps yet again. Playing Philadelphia detective John Book he is forced to go into hiding amongst the Amish community to protect a young Amish boy Samuel played by Lucas Haas. After travelling with his mother Rachel (Kelly McGillis) he is the only witness to a murder which takes place in a train station toilet. After scrolling through the mugshots of criminals at the police station, the boy identifies the murderer as one of John Book's fellow detectives. Police corruption rears it's ugly head as Book's immediate superior Inspector Schaeffer (Josef Sommer) is also in on a lucrative drugs scam, which was the motive for the murder. After an attempt is made by the murder detective (Danny Glover) to murder Book he gets a gunshot wound & goes into hiding with the Amish. Whilst recovering from his wound he falls in love Rachel. Without trying to give the whole film away there follows a couple of really loveably entertaining sequences before the final confrontation with his crooked boss & his criminal associates. Whilst trying to repair his car there is a most charming interlude with Rachel when John Book falls for her whilst over the car radio is played Sam Cooke's ""Don't Know Much About History"". After this a barn is built by the Amish men of Lancaster County in a communal effort of a single day. Before he became a detective John Book was a carpenter & is invited to join in the construction work. It is done to a delightful piece of music by french composer Maurice Jarre.

Amish culture, and to alesser extent, seeing a street-hardened cop, played by HarrisonFord, placed in that pacified and devout Amish world.  However,the whole battle of  ""good cop vs. bad cop"" is a little typical and notparticularly well executed here.  There are some good chuckleshere and there centered around Harrison's character, John Book,and his attempt to ""fit in"" with the Amish lifestyle, and some tenseaction sequences, as well.  The acting is solid, though nothing tooinspiring.  Ford actually plays a character that doesn't have a HALOrammed up his BUTT, as he has with much of the rest of hiscareer choices (I will never give him full-credit as an actor due tohis outright refusal to play a villain!).  (Unfortunately, I also thinkthis might have been where he turned down that somewhatdistasteful path as the ""man-at-odds/action hero"" that he hascome to personify). **SPOILER**The most redeeming feature of Witness is the non-Hollywoodending.  Despite the romantic build-up, and probable audiencewishes, it DOESN'T end with John and Rachel together.

113,alicespiral,A first-a one off,10,27 February 2007,"I don't think there's been a movie before which was set in an Amish community so this was well researched. There's always an air of mystery about things Amish-people who shun the centuries after the 18th-its probably the closest thing to an Ideal World and this movie shows how the Amish are more or less forced into knowing of the Evil in it because of the boy who witnessed a murder. The Amish live their lives away from 90% of the World but do nevertheless do business in it such as buying supplies from the nearest town or even using a telephone if they need to do.There are also other branches of he Amish like the Mennonites who accept technology to an extent. Their power comes from Generators and music is used mostly accapella singing of hymns-instruments are never played in public only in the Community and are usually harmoniums and accordeons.Thus the background music would have been more appropriate if it had been of this kind. One of the lines you notice in the movie-after Ford has clocked the thug-is somebody remarks-""this will spoil the tourist industry"" This is something the Amish don't directly benefit from but tourists are welcome to visit one of the communities to observe their way of life and they can buy from the gift shops-which is a source of income and its there because people want this sort of stuff. In fact there's now websites you can buy from-again not run by the Amish but there's probably an agreement to license products like models of horses and buggys or even CDs of genuine Amish hymn singing. Very recently the theme of this movie has taken on a kind of reality when there was a fatal shootout at an Amish school and obviously the police had to become involved",Witness
114,jillbeckinheim7,Powerful thriller starring Ford,8,31 October 2021,"""Witness"", his first film made outside Australia, is another example of Weir simultaneously working within an established genre and transcending it. On one level it is a traditional police thriller. While travelling with his mother a young boy named Samuel Lapp witnesses a murder in the washrooms at Philadelphia railway station. It turns out that the murdered man was an undercover police officer, and a homicide detective, John Book, is assigned to the case. Book's investigations lead him to the discovery that the murder was carried out by a narcotics officer named McFee, one of a group of corrupt officers in league with a gang of drug smugglers. Book is forced to go underground for safety, taking Samuel and his mother Rachel with him.On another level the film is a love story, as a romance develops between Book and Rachel, a beautiful young widow. Neither the crime story nor the romance element, however, would by themselves make this film anything out of the ordinary. What makes the film different is the third level, a study of cultural differences. Samuel and Rachel are members of the Amish religious sect, and it is among the Amish that they and Book take refuge while hiding from the villains.It would be easy to see the Amish, as portrayed in this film, as being quaint, even comically reactionary. They speak an archaic German dialect inaccurately known as ""Pennsylvania Dutch"" (although some of the lines in the film are in standard modern German). They follow a strict set of rules known as the ""Ordnung"" which govern every aspect of their daily lives. They may not own a television or a telephone and may not use electricity in the home. They drive horse-drawn buggies as it is forbidden to own or drive a motor vehicle. They have a strict dress code and are even forbidden to use buttons, regarded as a sign of ""Hochmut"", or pride. Those who violate these rules can be punished by shunning. The Amish habitually refer to all non-Amish Americans, regardless of ethnic background, as ""the English"". (News of the Declaration of Independence clearly has not yet filtered through to them).",Witness

It's my favorite scene in the film because just about everyone's had that experience--dancing with someone you're crazy about but still unfamiliar with.  They laugh, spin, get close, spin again, and even though they don't kiss, you aren't disappointed.  It's such a natural and perfectly believable scene; it's the second biggest reason I love this film.The first is, of course, Harrison Ford. Ford, People Magazine's Sexiest Man Alive in 1998 is well deserving of the title, not just for his weathered, tough-but-tender looks, but because of his enormous audience appeal earned through his *almost* flawless acting. I'm not sure on this, but I believe I heard Ford has starred in 7 of the top 20 films of all time. However, Ford has not won an Academy Award (yet) although he was nominated for his role in ""Witness."" His expressions speak volumes (as does Samual's, played beautifully by Lukas Haas). The end of the film seems a little too Hollywood-ish after such a novel first half, although the scene in which deadly corn pummels an assailant from above is great.  The outcome of the film seemed a little unlikely to me, and I was dissatisfied with its conclusion.

That's an understatement though considering the extreme tough guy persona he portrayed in other roles like Indiana Jones and Han Solo. Those performances were basically all action, but here, there's more of a personal depth to his portrayal of police detective, John Book.A young Amish boy witnesses a brutal murder committed in a public washroom and can't ever forget the face of the African American man who was a part of it. When that recognition leads to someone on the police force, the situation escalates into dangerous terrain where alleged dedicated members of law enforcement are held under suspicion as well.John Book is caught clearly in the middle and circumstances causes him to end up hiding in an Amish community and feel conflicting emotions with the boy's mother, Rachel. There's a clash of the Amish ways verses the modern way here and how John tries to adapt to their lifestyle, but his police training and violent defense tactics don't fit in well with their peaceful and none confrontational ways. John struggles with that and tries to reign himself in, all the while knowing what a dangerous situation the boy and all concerned were in.There's clearly a struggle there, but upon viewing it tonight, my main peeve was spotting none other than Viggo Mortensen among the Amish crowd. It bothered me how he just stood idly by while Harrison Ford valiantly fought off the bad guys pretty well on his own. A good example was when some punks started harassing a wagon load of the Amish passing through town and Viggo does nothing while Harrison has to do all the fist work.I know this movie came about before Viggo's heroic exploits as Aragorn in Peter Jackson's 'The Lord of the Rings', but knowing his potential, it's too bad the casting directors of the time didn't know that. They could've given him more of a meaty performance such as helping Harrison in the fighting and in the climatic finale. It just didn't feel right seeing him doing absolutely nothing.I'm viewing this from a different time frame though from when the film was first released so my perspective can be forgiven. This is an extremely well done movie and riveting all the way. What added fuel to the potency was the innocent and honest traditions of an Amish community tangled up into the corruption and brutality of modern day society.

And when Radhel gives him some clothes that were her late husband's and explains that zippers and buttons are 'too proud'.And as mentioned, if you once see the barn raising scene, it will stay with you forever.

I loved him in BLADE RUNNER, INDIANA JONES, THE FUGITIVE and may have even put in the greatest performance in a STAR WARS movie in THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK, but to me this is his greatest. He also does it in the old Steve McQueen-way with not very much dialogue. Its those expressions he uses when with Rachel or with little Samuel that really showed me what a great actor Harrison Ford is. Kelly McGillis also puts in a fabulous portrayal as Rachel Lapp. She as well doesn't say a whole lot, but she did a wonderful job showing the strength and absolute guts that Rachel Lapp had. Finally Lukas Haas, who like McGillis was fairly new to the film scene and their first big film does a terrific job as the young, innocent Samuel Lapp who has witnessed the worst side of what humans can bring. It's in that scene where he witnesses that murder that has melted into my mind.

Witness is as much about the meeting of cultures as about cops and robbers, this is one of those lucky movies which works out well on all counts and shows that there are still craftsmen lurking in Hollywood. The film is powerful, assured, full of beautiful imagery and devoid of easy moralising, which is good. Ford is Chicago Detective John Book, assigned to investigate a murder that was committed by crooked cop Danny Glover. The only witness is the son of an Amish widow, played by Kelly McGillis. When Book gets too close to the truth, the crooked cops try to kill him, forcing Book to take it on the lamb and hide out in the Amish country.

124,Cue-ball,An unusual culture clash,9,3 March 2003,"There is a standard cliché in many action movies, in which a protagonist, having stoically endured the abuse of a bully or bullies, finally reaches his boiling point, lashes out, and gives the antagonist his comeuppance, usually to the delight of the audience. In one of the many special moments in Witness, such a confrontation between a hero and a villain ultimately does not deliver the expected emotional pay-off; surprisingly, the hero's violence calls his character into question, and the villain gains our sympathy. I mention this scene because it best reveals the true character of the movie Witness, which is not so much a police drama, but a film about one man's introspection.Witness is set, for the most part, in Amish Country in Pennsylvania. The opening scenes show simple farm houses, jigsaw-puzzle scenes of farmhouses and livestock, and plain, horse-drawn buggies -- buggies, however, equipped with red reflectors, the first sign that this movie is not set in the eighteenth century. Indeed, one buggy is able to clog a highway full of eighteen wheelers and station wagons full of tourists. The movie commences in the home of the Lapps -- Rachel, her son Samuel and his grandfather Eli. A family tragedy cause Rachel and Samuel to set out for Maryland, changing trains in Philadelphia. While they are in the station, Samuel accidentally witnesses a terrible crime, and he becomes the focal point of the Philly police, including John Book. The family is taken to a bar in a bad part of town while Book checks out a lead, and Samuel has to leaf through dozens of mug shots. The tension increases dramatically when he identifies the suspect, and Book realizes that the boy's life is in danger. It becomes necessary to hide the boy and his mother; luckily, this is rather easily accomplished in their community, where phones are rare and last names are shared by hundreds of the neighbors. Book is also forced to remain with Sarah and Samuel, and become invisible among the Amish. His time among them causes him to re-examine the rules he has lived by.There is a crime subplot in Witness, but it is mostly a device to set up the real story in the movie -- what happens when a large city policeman, skilled in fighting and firearms, is compelled to live among people who have forsworn killing and violence to please God according to their faith. Living among the Amish, Book is transformed for the better, as he remembers his simpler skills and values. Harrison Ford's performance is nuanced note-perfect; an ordinary, uninteresting policeman changes into an extraordinary, gentle neighbor. Yet his big-city edge is never erased, and ultimately he must confront whether to stay in the new world he has discovered or return to the world he knows.Witness is beautifully photographed (one gets an idea where we get the phrase ""amber waves of grain"") and Maurice Jarre's soundtrack reflects the simplicity of the characters and the setting.

It is void of the overbearing nature that is associated with white representative cinema. The community lunch scene really brings out the quiet and poor American country and is poignant in its description. The movie evokes some if not complete sympathy without putting too much stress on the film-maker as a selection bias. A confidently made film, Harrison Ford and Kelly Mcgillis do well in their roles that are challengingly set in an intermediary form of the past and the present. It has stood the test of time. Josef Sommer is good and fits well into the film.
Communicative cinema differs from universal cinema in the sense that it is politically directed at a specific group, and thus will have the social distance related to political discourse. Quite naturally, it will lose the social impact cinema is meant to have on its audience making it very difficult to judge as cinema.
Alternatives are available to directors (who are well aware of them) before they choose their plans for the film, thus defining the job of what a director really is, someone who is able to select the right form from the set of alternatives, and how reminding somebody of them post-production is really puzzling to me.
Its direct nature gives it the freedom to sustain itself without any acclaim, it also restricts it permanently from any opportunities of development, and gradually reclines it to a secondary role of more socio-religious than aesthetic criticism. The effectiveness of this criticism is sadly limited to communication.
If lacking from self-belief or lacking in the ability to interpret and recreate, people indulging in this form of cinema must work their way into more independent cinema by working constantly with industry professionals. Simple skill and development issues must not hamper creativity. They can always be honed later over a career span.",Witness

For the ending, the natural thriller pace comes back, it's intense too because we know Book is a good guy who's protective of his hosts. They could have overdone this with a DePalma style OTT shoot out, but this was just right for the movie.The only flaw is a pretty incredible decision by Book just to go into hiding at the Amish farm, putting them all at risk. In reality he'd be shopping his bent police chief to the FBI, the press and anyone else who'd listen and seeking witness protection for the boy. A major flaw, but the creators wanted to finish the movie at the Amish community as well, which is understandable.Overall a real breath of fresh air for the thriller genre, a well rounded movie with something for everyone, an original setting and a fantastic lead link up with Ford at his best and an almost unknown McGillis proving sex appeal doesn't need glamour at all! One of my favourites, a little gem of a thriller.",Witness
132,Budd-5,An unstereotypical view of a very misunderstood culture.,7,9 July 2000,"The Omish are a strange culture who have been tormented for having such a backward way of living. The movies are as much to blame for this torment as anyone. Kingpin anyone? I'm not complaining about the Farrelly Brother's farce, it was undoubtedly funny but I needed a less stereotypical view to better understand this misunderstood culture.Peter Weir's ""Witness"" is such a movie. He accomplishes a lot in this picture. He has a fine romance, some accomplished action and expert acting. However, the movie succeeds most in its depiction of the Omish people. Their very religious ways were greatly contrasted with the ordinary way of living. Weir doesn't preach however that their way is better, he gives an objective view. Weir highlights their sensitive culture but his praise of it in the beautiful barnraising sequence is contrasted by the obvious taunts of their unbelievable stubborness to enter the twentieth century.I admire Weir's unpredictability as a filmmaker. It seemed obvious to me that one of the Omish would become jealous of Harrison Ford's character but it never happened. I was surprised that the bad guy didn't struggle more at the end. I was surprised throughout.The movie was in no way conventional but in some ways this let it down. It has dramatic elements but as a whole not a lot happens. The characters are strong and the acting is great but the plot itself is shallow. Sure the police corruption is a nice touch, but perhaps more of the movie could have been used to highlight the obvious culture clash.",Witness

And the soundtrack was cheesy. Great acting, cinematography, I'll give it that. I think the film took on too much. I just found it nearly impossible to believe his calmness in the face of one of the worst realities a cop can face: the corruption of his friends and mentors. And maybe I'm just jaded by better films on this topic which were made later: L.A. Confidential, 13 Blocks, even Copland.

Harrison Ford is simply a very good actor...it is always a pleasure to watch him work so effortlessly (or so it seems) in playing a character.

I have it on DVD and also saved to my DVR. It's my favorite because the barn raising sequence reminds me a little of my own very young (3-4 years old) life when my dad helped build a church in Wilmington, CA shortly after the war, and I helped my dad (sorta). It's the music (Raising the Barn) that makes it so memorable. For about 20 years that I know of, any time Witness was shown on TV, tourism to Landcaster and Strausburg Pennsylvania would surge. My wife and I visited a couple times in the 1990's, and even had dinner with an Amish family one evening. It's interesting to see the Amish kids getting about on scooters and roller skates because they shun modern conveniences like electricity, telephones, and mechanical farming equipment (they use horses). Many of the towns in the area have really quirky names - Bird-In-Hand, Intercourse, Climax, Paradise, Blue Ball, etc. (if I remember rightly). It's a powerful movie, and makes one yearn for a simple life (until the reality of no electricity, no TV, no car, and no zippers kicks in).",Witness

The movie follows the seemingly pointless hiding in an Amish community of a detective (Harrison Ford) who is investigating a murder witnessed by a young boy from the community. During his stay Ford falls for the mother of the child (Kelly McGillis) which serves no more purpose then to give us a god awful dance scene and inevitable forbidden love scenario, the one good thing to come out of this arrangement is the obligatory 80's tit shot.

I think whether this scene express the real situation and view to Amish. I felt that silent performances is wonderful at last. Although there are no words between John Book and Rachel, their silent performance tells us their love and sadness.

I'd wonder how the general attitude in the US might have been at the rather shocking corruption in the Police. I need to view it again and note when John actually realised that the Boss cop was seriously bent as well as the perpetrators who the lad had seen. Book certainly hadn't discerned this, at the time of reporting to him at first about the bathroom murder.Harrison Ford is masterful in his actor craft in this film. It helps too that he has a naturally 'tortured' facial expression! The decision to seem to be ""a fly on the wall"" with many of the Amish scenes, and the decision not to sub-title the quite long passages of dialogue in the German dialect gave an extra layer of authenticity to the movie. Today's gender equality mores were somewhat challenged as the big day - putting up the barn - took on a choreography bordering on ritual; men bonded in the great task; women glided about re-filling glasses of juice and serving good food in deeply joyful respect of their men's work. A very engaging, at times scarily tense in thriller style, with a great balance of male-female tenderness with nuances deeply respectful of the Amish' values. A terrific movie.",Witness

I would choose this above ""The graduate"", ""The godfather"", ""One flew over the cuckoo's nest"" and all the other great films of the last 50 years. It tells a simple tale of innocence and corruption superbly well. There is visual cinema of the highest order in the building of the barn. There is this total contrast between the rustic peace of the community, and the chaotic brutality of the outside world. There is a career-defining performance from one of our great actors, Harrison Ford. All the supporting actors play their parts with understated dignity, I would single out Kelly McGillis who has never looked so beautiful, and Lukas Haas who shows the fragility but also the robustness of childhood. As has been pointed out, much of the acting occurs without dialogue.Perhaps the movie is now beginning to show its age.

148,MichaelORourke,"Hollywood Wins, the Amish Lose",5,27 July 2014,"I saw ""Witness"" in 1985 in a small town in Oregon. At the time I was enamored of director Peter Weir's work, ""The Last Wave,"" ""Gallipoli,"" ""The Year of Living Dangerously."" Of late, I'm being drawn more and more into independent filmmaking, and I thought ""Witness"" might be a good one to screen again, because as I remember it, it had minimal locations, most of them in a rural Amish community. The setup is bloody brilliant – a 10-year-old Amish boy witnesses a grizzly murder in a train station bathroom. But the plot begins to unravel immediately when Detective John Book (Harrison Ford) wheels and deals with witness rights and protection – forcing Amish mother Rachel (Kelly McGillis) and her son Samuel (Lucas Haas) to ride to a bar to identify a potential suspect. He leaves them alone in the police car in a ghetto while he goes inside to roughhouse his pick of the week for a fall guy! Book's investigation continues in like manner for the first act of the film, demolishing any suspension of disbelief. That, and inexplicably bad acting on the part of the bad cop cast, invite comparison to a TV cop show at its worst, talented actors notwithstanding.There was however, an exceptional reveal in Act I: Samuel's identification of the murderer is brilliantly staged. Unfortunately, the bad cop setup telegraphs a violent finale, completely wrecking the film's premise – how do you protect the innocent and vulnerable in a community that embraces nonviolence? This is an extremely exciting, groundbreaking idea. To place an Amish kid as the key witness of a grizzly murder – these are ingredients for a powerful, game changing film. How are the members of the Amish community going to handle the introduction of guns, a law enforcement system dependent on violence, men who are conditioned to find a violent solution – how will the Amish ""disarm"" this invasion without violating its sacred mission? 99% of the general population are dependent upon and conditioned to violence as a solution to violent crime. This story has seeds of extraordinary promise to explore another paradigm. Alas, the Hollywood machine really made a mess of this one. Book is healed of a gunshot wound by means of Amish medicinal practice; he gives up his gun and ammo to his Amish hostess; he pitches in to help with a communal barn-raising in a scene that is a small miracle, showing the capacity of a community to accomplish substantial things in just one day. Book recognizes the possibility of mutual physical bonding with Rachel, his own sexual needs, as well as hers. He turns away from the temptation to violate the Amish code. At this point it is a heroic action. However, this plot point unravels when they do consummate at a later time.Having shown Book as a man of roughshod integrity, one would hope he has enough chutzpah to honor his hosts. He has the opportunity to prepare himself in a soul-searching manner for the inevitable show down. How do you serve and protect in the Amish way?When the police department goons show up determined to exterminate the witness and his family, the film descends into the same old same old (sic) showdown at the OK Corral. Hollywood loves this stuff, and, based on box office receipts, so do audiences. To be fair, Book does choose one ingenious tactic when he improvises the use of corn in a silo as a defensive weapon. There is a very real temptation to argue (and Hollywood did and won) that the lone town marshal pitted against 3 heavily armed outlaws-made-more-outlawish-by-being-lawmen requires a shoot 'em up conclusion. That works for Tombstone in 1881, but is it necessary in this Amish community of 1985? Does not their faith have more power than the gun?The issue of guns and violence was volatile in '85, and has grown increasingly contentious and dangerous in 2014. This film missed the opportunity to explore authentically the interaction of two distinct American cultures in the Heartland. It is heartbreaking to consider the horrific consequences suffered by the dominant culture's near complete lack of will to examine or act on gun control. That Mr. Weir agreed to direct this mishmash without challenging our 2nd Amendment preconceptions is, in my opinion, tragic. Of course it will take a great deal more than a single film to bring change of this caliber in our American life. Had Mr. Weir and Mr. Harrison brought their considerable talents to bear on the subject, the conversation and the legislation today might be a good deal more reasonable and civilized.",Witness

A cup was murdered in a station and an Armish boy Samuel saw the murder. John Book, a justice cop investigate the case. But soon it revealed who had done it. John reported who is the murderer to his boss, but the boss was an asshole, he ordered the murder and tried to elase John Book and Armish witness. John was shooted, but he escaped into a village of Armish. He did not go to a hospital, because doctors must notify gunshot and the dirty cops will find him and Sammuel. Instead of it, Rachel took care of him. After his recovery, he lived there for a while because if he had gone back, he would soon been arrested. 
John noticed Armish life beautiful but full of difficelties in this era. People don't understand them is very rude to Armish. They humliated Amish or treated them as animals in circus. John was filled with strong moral, he could not endure all of it. But actually he was them a few days ago. He stands in Armish side now.
""Be careful amongst English"" Mr. Rup told Rachel when she left the village, and he told John when he went home too. It means Mr. Rup now recognized him as one of them, Armish.
It is very funny and surprizing that corn became a weapon while John Book ran from dirty cops.
Soon after that he shooted to kill one. Gun is the power. He left his to Rachel, it means he agrees to obey Armish custom. If he had kept that, he would never have been found. He was found because of violence.

He is a man who at first glance has no matching ideals. The film is fantastic on that level, especially thanks to Peter Weir's direction, who brilliantly shows Ford gradually becoming accepted by the Amish men.There is very little dialogue among the characters, and Rachel (McGillis) talks even less, not because she doesn't have anything to say, but because Amish rules of life don't seem to allow her to. They are presented as a quiet people, so McGillis has the difficult task of making Rachel speak without dialogue, and she does it well, which carries over to Ford (he got an Oscar nomination, she didn't).It's only at the climax of the film, when the action takes over that the film begins to weaken. The filmmakers seem to have some kind of answer to how the killer's storyline should be resolved, but it's not very good.Despite the flaw, the film is excellent based on the performances of the cast, the editor who had to put all the dialogue-less scenes together (and later, won the Oscar for it), and Weir's masterful handling of the story.",Witness

Book must hide among the Amish population while recovering from an attempt to kill him by these cops. Danny Glover is very convincing as the murderous villain.  While the formula of the tough city copy falling in love with the Amish boy's mother (Kelly McGillis) is predictable, the performances are so convincing it pulls the audience closer to the characters and sets the standard for such films.  There is an exceptional (and rather chaste) sponge bath scene (her back is turned to the audience) though lacking any dialogue, where the two characters stare at one another and communicate such passion, longing and sexual tension, with only their eyes and a few mannerisms to convey their feelings.

First I like Harrison Ford he`s doing a great job and see Kelly McGillis who hasn`t looked better in any other movie ! This movie shows it all. Action, romance, love and even more. It is fun watching it ! It also shows the conflict between the amish and civilisation ! The whole movie is fun watching it. And although it has something like a happy end there is still something remaining that could bring tears in your eyes.",Witness
166,Wee_Bay,Boring!,1,9 May 2015,"IMDb has this film tagged as Crime, Drama, Romance and in that order. They need the change it to Romance, Drama, Crime. After the first part of the movie where we see a murder scene and a young Amish by is the key witness, we are lead to believe that it will be the main storyline and the movie will go down this path. It doesn't. That story takes a back seat and the pace gets slower and the movie gets extremely boring. Amish people are quite one dimensional, if you know what their lifestyle is about, then I'm pretty sure you can guess how exciting the movie is considering that most of it takes place in their community. This movie was described as a Thriller...the only time I was thrilled was when it ended.Oh, and at the end, Harrison Ford just ends up telling the guy off like it was a toddler misbehaving.",Witness
167,tfalconi,I'm sorry this won two Oscars?,3,30 November 2008,"This movie was not that good at all. Here is the first clue and that it is not gonna be a strong movie, Harrison Ford's name not only appears first but it is also bigger than the title. The music was nominated for an Oscar, What the heck was that? That music was probably the most annoying thing in the movie. The acting was sub par at best, except the Amish boy he did a decent job for being so young. Then you have the story which was weak and a little over the place, and it won for adapted! The music was horrid, I know I already said something but it was really bad. The premises was real good and it should be remade. Well that's all I really have on that.Your Average Movie Guy,-Trever",Witness

169,CodyC,"Decent, but a tad overrated",6,3 February 2000,"I was surprised that this film got as much recognition from the Oscars as it did.  Peter Weir's directing is certainly praiseworthy and the cinematography is outstanding, but overall, the film falls a little flat. The romance between Ford and McGillis was forced and the end was predictable.Ford puts up a decent performance, but unfortunately I find that this one is much like many of the other movies that Ford has been in since.Overall, 6.5 out of 10.",Witness
170,frogsaroyan,A Visionary Film with Details Not To Be Taken For Granted,9,18 December 2014,"It is easy to see why Witness took home the Oscar for Best Screenplay. In the first 15 minutes, fewer than 20 lines are spoken, and they are all inconsequential. Even the first full line of the line of the film spoken by a recurring character is just a joke about a horse's prowess. Nothing is said, and yet everything is so clear. Too clear. We see everything and feel everything, just like the boy. It takes a very good screenplay to say so much with next to nothing. The scenes where Samuel takes the train and wanders through the station could be its own short film... ""Amish Boy Takes The Train."" I don't think that these moments, and the beautiful shots of Pennsylvania country, should be taken for granted. This film was made with care. I believe it's a visionary film, and I was transfixed. It is a film about a boy, as the title suggests, not about Harrison Ford. Samuel is part angel, witnessing the deeds of humanity, and he is human, witnessing how we share our sins. We learn from this boy, as do the other characters.The most important detail is this... the little boy witnessed a murder. This isn't something that will go away for him or be given compensation. Some reviewers have said they don't like how certain scenes and characters appear smarmy. Well, to a little boy with innocence, any person who doesn't have the highest personal integrity and truthful intentions appears smarmy. The murder itself is messy and mean, because that's what most murder is. It isn't some slick and stylish operation carried out by highly intelligent hit men. About the music. It sounds like the score by Maurice Jarre was influenced largely by Aaron Copland. Jarre was regularly hired for visionary films; ones with a ""person who sees the value in what other people don't"" theme like Gorillas In The Mist and Dead Poets Society, or ones with religious themes like Almost An Angel and Witness, or supernatural themes like Ghost and Jacob's Ladder (and Prancer!). The synthesizer is dated, yes, and therefore it's slightly unnerving, but if taken at face value and in context you can hear the ""otherworldly"" effect that Jarre is going for. It is music for strings, but airing in sampled sounds... so what you hear are the ghosts of the strings, the echo, the strings reincarnated. It's eerier. Besides that, the music is complex, sophisticated, and it's front and centre. It isn't in the background, nor should it be. I believe that for the average moviegoer who doesn't regularly enjoy listening to a variety of orchestral music, the score might seem like ""too much"" and therefore distracting. It's too bad that some people can't admit that complex orchestral music isn't too their taste, and instead they judge the music as ""bad"". It most certainly isn't bad. Perhaps in places it really is ""too much"", but there are places where the movie overall is too much, music aside. Easily forgiven.",Witness
171,annemarieko,Therefore come out from among them and be thou separate,8,6 October 2006,"I watch this movie every time it comes on television just to see and hear the wonderful Jan Rubes tell his grandson the consequences of using guns and violence. When his grandson says that he would kill the bad man, his grandfather asks if he can see into the heart of this bad man, and as for the gun, ""what you take into your hand, you take into your heart"". The beautiful green Lancaster County countryside and the dark seedy streets of Philadelphia are as different as lives of the two main characters. Despite the forced romance, the acting is very strong especially Jan and Lucas, and this is the only film I've ever seen that shows the strong character of the Amish, people who actually live by the values they claim to hold. They're poking fun at us instead of being the butt of the joke.",Witness
172,asadmontana,Great Film But Wasn't As Good As I Expected,7,26 October 2006,The film is definitely good. Packed with action but not enough suspense. All the gaps are too easily filled in the viewer's mind. Not even 2 hours longs. Too short. But there are some good acting performances from Ford and others. Starts off brilliant but the end comes way too quick and sudden. Danny Glover has a small role. There should have been more action and suspense. And what the hell was up with the guy who got suffocated by the corn?? A bit mediocre? And the fact that the police chief handed over his shotgun to Ford was just plain stupid. No climax. Boring. i wouldn't say the film was overrated but definitely not as good as some make it to be.,Witness
173,hmarq,Really Great Movie,10,31 July 2001,"Although this movie is not Harrison Ford's best known, which is probably The Fugitive, this is still my favorite movie.  This movie has action, romance, and is a very enjoyable movie (so are The Fugitive and Air Force One).This movie also contains a scene that I think everyone who has seen the movie will never forget--""What A Wonderful This Would Be.""  This moment combines one of my favorite songs with one of my favorite actors, and the result is amazing.  If you don't watch the movie for any other reason, watch it for this scene.The plot for this movie is creative and I thoroughly enjoyed watching all of the actors and actresses who did a marvelous job in it.  1985--what I great year--both Witness and MacGyver made their premieres.",Witness

Harrison Ford is my favorite actor and this is truly his greatest performance! should have one the Best Actor Oscar!And Kelly Mcgillis is perfect as Rachel,Ford's love interest.Lukas Haas also perfect as the sweet innocent Amish boy Samuel who saw the murder.

175,sslop,Regarding the accents...,9,8 April 2005,"I would like to clear up a couple of comments made by movieguy1021, who wrote:""One thing I didn't understand is how come everyone seemed to use such strong accents yet they've been living in America for a long time.""Most Amish communities mainly speak Pennsylvania Dutch, which is a dialect of German, hence the accents in the film. Amish children learn English in school.And:""Also, although I may not be the end-all, be-all of Amish knowledge, it seems like for people so strict in their rules, they broke them easily. They didn't seem to object to riding in trains or cars, or even using technology.""The Amish accept some forms of modernisation as long as it is not deemed disruptive to their social structure. Some forms of primitive technology are accepted in their community, such as devices that assist with milking cows. Likewise they accept rides in cars, but members of the community cannot own them.",Witness
176,t_l_callahan,Still holds up after 20 years,8,7 June 2007,"I saw this movie for the first time as a child, maybe 7 or 8. And even though I have seen it many times, it is still one of my favorite films. While the story line is incredible, the acting is superb. Harrison Ford is very subtle in a role that could have been overdone and contrived. He is completely believable as the slightly arrogant, but kind hearted detective John Book. Kelly McGillis is perfect as a dutiful Amish woman suddenly longing to step outside of her community's restrictions. She brings a quiet dignity to a people most of us know nothing about.The barn raising scene is my absolute favorite part of this film. It shows us the true identity of the Amish people; a community wholly dependent upon each other, and each other's willingness to help out one of their own.",Witness
177,mrgolf145,Plot has too many holes,8,31 October 2007,There are a couple of things in this movie that just defy belief. If the crooked cops wanted to kill an undercover cop before he got them why would they do it in a public restroom during the day in the middle of one of the busiest train stations in the U.S. instead of waylaying him at night in a deserted spot? Why wouldn't Book contact either Internal Affairs or the FBI or even someone in the media while he was hiding out in Amish Country instead of just waiting for Glover and company to come get him? After Book was healed and knowing what danger might come to his family if Book stayed there why wouldn't old Eli Lapp show Book the door? The scenery and acting make this a very good movie but the plot has too many holes.,Witness
178,stubscub,has best kiss on film,10,14 December 2005,"In addition to being gripping and cinematically flawless (goof's aside), Witness contains one of the best on-screen kisses in the history of film. The scene marks the peak moment in Witness's romantic plot-line when the two protagonists discover who they truly are to one another, and what the future holds for them. As an audience, we behold two people from radically different societies, who have shared both personal and cultural antipathy, fall in love both with each other, and with each other's worlds. The result is a passionate and organic expression of love and sexual desire that is at once titillating and moving. Admitting neither the customary fondlings nor the rote shedding of clothing, this brief love-scene stands alone in movie history for its power, sincerity, and beauty.",Witness
179,kierongross-1,fantastic film,10,7 July 2006,"A young Amish boy (Samuel) witnesses the murder of a police officer and is promptly thrust into a dangerous game of cat & mouse.The thing i love about witness is that the film completely tricked me into believing it was one thing only to turn out to be so much more. On the surface you would be forgiven to believe this was just another cop movie where corruption is rife and greed has overshadowed why indeed people become police officers.This is the basic premise and it works very well with Harrison ford faultless as the upstanding john book, but this is just a distraction from the very personal and unforgettable journey that john, Rachel and of course Samuel take.When john returns Samuel and his mother to there community he wants to leave as soon as possible but forced to stay due to the fact that he has a rather nasty bullet wound that needs urgent medical attention he has no choice but to recover in the care of Rachel.It is here where the story really began to unfold for me, having been bought up with a steady diet of TV and the hustle and bustle of police life at first john seems like a fish out of water at the way this Pennsylvanian Amish community live, given time though john seems to embrace this way of life and suddenly seems to become free in a way he has never experienced and never expected, growing closer and closer to Samuel's mother Rachel (kelly McGill's),this tense thriller suddenly becomes a much more personal film with love and loss its central themes.",Witness

184,robert-obrien-1,School house murders reminded me of this little gem of a film,10,3 October 2006,"Yesterday's crazed gunman's rampage in Lanacaster County PA against those poor little Amish school girls reminded me of this movie and its premise of bad guys looking for the little Amish boy. The movie gives an all-too-short glimpse into the innocence of these often misunderstood folk, and the terror they must feel when threatened from the outside.True, they choose to be defenceless by their faith, but that does not lessen any fear they must certainly have.Sadly, today's headlines in the aftermath of the bloodbath in Nickel Mines remind us that not everything can EASILY be dismissed as ""just a movie"".",Witness
185,tgjackson93,Ford at his best,8,5 September 2014,"Witness is often cited as Harrison Ford's greatest cinematic performance and it is not difficult to see why in this detective/drama/thriller story about an unfortunate witness to a deeply layered crime. The witness is a relatively mute, 4-5 year old boy with an unfortunate haircut (not too dissimilar from Danny Torrance in The Shining – ""red rum, reed rumm, reeeddd rummm"") who belongs to an Amish community.We are presented this Amish country in the opening scenes, immediately introducing one of the film's more important themes of the contrasts between the Amish lifestyle and a *normal* lifestyle and what problems this can induce.After the boy thrillingly witnesses a murder in a public bathroom and just as thrillingly escapes the murderers' grasp, man of the hour (or meagre 112 minutes) Harrison Ford as a monotonous (bar the famous and rather cringe-worthy It's a Wonderful World scene ), dry, robust hero prone to falling in love (sound familiar Chewy or Shorty?) takes on the case.Once the boy identifies a policeman as the murderer, Ford discovers the Head of Service is involved too. A break in the thrilling suspense and action sees Ford seek refuge and convincingly adjust to life in the boy and his mother's Amish community (set in a place called Intercourse, something which never failed to amuse me when I stayed last year).Making time for Ford in ""plain"" Amish clothing and singing It's a Wonderful World is not something you will regret. This culturally- enlightening thriller captures Harrison Ford at his emotive best as this far-from-home cop, but is Han Solo/Indiana Jones enough to satisfy his returning fans.",Witness
186,paper-5,Regarding the bloody nose scene,10,17 September 2005,"John Book loses it and breaks and bloodies the nose of one of the townsfolk taunting his new Amish friends. Viewing this scene out of context, it does seem as though the trigger is just the uncalled for derision getting to him because of his growing appreciation for this community. While the taunting does nothing to soothe his state of mind obviously, it is the sudden and shocking news (received over the phone prior to making the trip in the carriage) that his partner in the police department has been killed that sets things brewing in this scene and lends fury to his punches. Otherwise, I don't believe this character would have acted out this violently. He might have just stepped out of the carriage and delivered some scathing sarcasm. In other words, the bloody nose scene was not a facile insertion to satisfy the audience's desire for some comeuppance. Rather, it flowed naturally from the previous action.",Witness
187,LATINMAGDA,Peace and beauty of the Amish,10,10 July 2005,"A commentator says that Rachel's beauty is unique and suggests that Amish women are not beautiful..On the contrary, most are beautiful. Their dress is quaint to most people, but no matter what they wear they have beauties all over the place as in any other place in the world. Their simplicity and plain style and manner makes them more attractive. Their plain way of living somehow makes their beauty more radiant and luminescent. The commentator surely has not been in Amish country. I have been there and always feel a sense of freshness and elevation of the spirit. When living in Pennsylvania I worked in the Hershey Children's Hospital where their children were hospitalized. The sense of family and community just oozed from their beings. It was also interesting to hear them speak in their German dialect. It was more interesting to see how they look so at ease with us the members of their outer world.",Witness
188,tomquilty,Great film to revisit many times!,9,23 June 2020,Having just watched this film for the first time in many years. What struck me was that it has aged so well and the story is as strong and relatable as it was the first time I watched it. Cinema has evolved so much since this was first released and not just the Marvel/DC stranglehold on mainstream movies but the competition from such amazing TV. We still have great story driven movies but the style and subtlety of this beautiful film by Peter Weir is a rare thing now. I read that Peter Weir still feels like the bathroom murder scene is very violent. In the context of what we see today on film and on Twitter it feels tame. The only shock is it's Danny Glover! Harrison Ford and Kelly McGillis have a genuine chemistry and do well to not over play the early interactions. A great movie and I'll watch it again many times for sure. Massive recommendation. 9/10.,Witness
189,god_moe,trivia and tidbits,9,2 November 2005,"I'm the grandson of Jan Rubes, so I've obviously got some bias towards this movie. Rather than share my opinions of this movie I thought I'd tell you all some trivia that you can't find on IMDb.In the scene where Book opens the corn feed hatch the stuntman down below drops the gun in a different position than planned by stunt coordinators and Peter Weir. When watching the movie you will notice that Book is searching for the gun for about 2-4 seconds. It was actually about 20-30 times that long (1-2 minutes) because the gun was not right beside the stunt man as originally planned.If anyone has been in an acting class and told the importance of timing watch the scene where Book and Eli discuss milking a cow.Eli Lapp: You never had your hands on a teat before.
