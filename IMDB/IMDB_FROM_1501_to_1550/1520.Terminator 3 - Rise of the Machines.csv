0,TheLittleSongbird,"The beginning of the decline of the Terminator films, but not as bad as reputed and better than the succeeding two films",7,4 September 2015,"The first Terminator is among the best of its genre, and Terminator 2 is bigger, richer and every bit as fantastic a film, one of the few sequels to be as great as its predecessor (Aliens, Godfather Part 2 and the Toy Story sequels are also noteworthy in this regard). Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is certainly better than the two films following it and it is not that bad a film, but it is nowhere near as good as the first two.It is a bit unbalanced, with some misplaced and clumsily written comic relief that really does jars and there's far too much of it, and while the story is cohesive at least it is too more of the same, with in the first half not having anywhere near enough of the suspense and dark atmosphere (pretty predictable in fact), and some of the monologues ramble on too much, a few almost endless.Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is a visually well-made film with a nice atmosphere with an appropriate darkness to it, it is slickly shot and edited and the special effects while not as stunning as the ones in Terminator 2 are solidly constructed. Jonathan Mostow is no James Cameron, but he does direct competently. There is a pulsating music score that has the right amount of energy and mysterious atmosphere while being too obvious, and while the script is uneven and not expansive enough with the characterisation it at least doesn't sound stilted and doesn't become so stupid that you're bashing your head repeatedly on a wall. Terminator's one liners are as wry as ever.Regarding the action, it is still thrilling and expensive in look with some high-octane chases and well-choreographed action. While the first half drags and is not very well-written, the story really picks up and becomes more diverting with much more of the dark atmosphere as seen before. The cast are good, with Arnold Schwarzenegger coming off best in the title role, imposing, badness and sometimes amusing, while Kristanna Loken is surprisingly and suitably y poised. Claire Danes does a good job with a not so interesting character, and while Nick Stahl underwhelms sometimes , being a little stiff and dull to start with, he is a decent fit and improves dramatically as the film gets better.All in all, not that bad but vastly inferior in quality to the first two films. 6.5/10 Bethany Cox",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
1,Leofwine_draca,"Not up to the level of the first two, but it's still a great sci-fi action flick",8,11 November 2016,"To start off with, TERMINATOR 3 is just not up to the level of its two predecessors. The first two films in the series were classics, skilfully made by James Cameron with an eye for perfection and detail, timeless masterpieces to be watched over and over again. Watching Arnie progress from vindictive killer to humanitarian robot was a great emotional experience and one that my generation grew up with. For TERMINATOR 3, all of the emotion and drama has gone; what we're left with is just another action-orientated summer blockbuster, albeit a very good action-orientated summer blockbuster. No more subtext or detail; no more perfectly-crafted movie. But the action – the action alone makes this a must-see.The plot is basically the same as that of TERMINATOR 2, at least for the first two thirds of the film. There is a heck of a lot of action packed into a relatively short time. Wicked shoot-outs with police in a graveyard, the mother of all showdowns between two machines in a lavatory (amazing stuff), people being executed in cold blood, plus much much more. The violence has been toned down but the film still packs a brutal edge – watch out for the stomach punch to see what I mean. By far the greatest action sequence is the exhilarating crane chase, which is absolutely classic, one of the best chases I've ever seen; truly the highlight in cinematic viewing this year. A real pulse-pounding thrill-ride which makes up for any deficiencies the film might otherwise have. Director Jonathan Mostow cut his teeth on the thriller genre with the little-seen but very good Kurt Russell starrer BREAKDOWN, before going on to make the superior submarine epic U-571. All these films have had great direction and very well handled action, making Mostow once one of the most promising action directors in today's cinema.Back to TERMINATOR 3. Arnold is back, inevitably, and he's older but still in great shape. His terminator here is colder, less human, but with a fine line in quips and one-liners; indeed most of his dialogue is monosyllabic, quotable stuff. He doesn't really get time to connect with the audience, but he holds his own in the action sequences, and to see an actor returning to his best role after a somewhat lean period is a real pleasure; hats off to Arnie for making this film work. Linda Hamilton is gone now but long forgotten; her character had nowhere else to go. Claire Danes plays a younger version of the Sarah Connor-style fighter, and is pretty good. But the best performance goes to Nick Stahl as John Connor, playing a mentally scarred drug addict going through some very hard times.Kristanna Loken is all right as the Terminatrix, although its hard to see her as a serious menace. The clashes between her and Arnie make for classic entertainment, and I especially loved the hard-hitting sound effects which accompany them. Other things to watch and listen out for are a welcome cameo from Earl Boen (the only other actor to appear in all three films with Schwarzenegger) and Marco Beltrami's effective orchestral score; it's sad that Brad Fiedel's classic theme is relegated to the closing credits, but to be fair Beltrami does a good job and I'd like to see him go far. The finale of the film moves into new territory (instead of just being a rehash of the TERMINATOR 2 plot) as the machines come to life, leading to plenty of mass destruction and gunfire; excellent again. Special effects (both mechanical, pyrotechnic, and CGI) are remarkable. The moment where Arnie struggles against his programming is good, even if it does show up the star's limitations. In comparison, the final showdown between the two damaged robots is far too rushed and unmemorable; you barely have time to register what happened. The way is paved for a fourth instalment with a downer of an ending which is the most unexpected and remarkable thing in the whole movie. TERMINATOR 3 isn't a great movie by any means, but instead a good movie with some great action and only a few flaws. Check it out.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
2,SnoopyStyle,Some good action but inferior to the original two,6,12 September 2014,"John Connor (Nick Stahl) is a young man living off the grid as a drifter. He is still haunted by nightmares of an apocalyptic future. Future SkyNet sends back T-X (Kristanna Loken) to hunt down various people including Kate Brewster (Claire Danes). She's the daughter of U.S. Air Force General Robert Brewster who is reluctant to activate SkyNet on their system. There is a computer supervirus infecting the world. Another Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) arrives to protect John. John breaks into Kate's animal clinic to steal medicine. It turns out that they knew each other as teens before the original Terminator.This is not bigger and better than the other two. That is its biggest sin in the logic of sequels. It has some good action but it's not bigger than the second one. The car chase is lots of fun especially with real action. It doesn't bring anything new to the franchise. It is merely a continuation. Nick Stahl should have been a good lead. At least, the movie NEEDED him to be good. Instead, he's merely capable. Claire Danes is much better. The standout is Arnold who looks amazing at his age. I didn't particularly like the coincidence of Kate and John being in the same place. The humor isn't as good. The lines aren't as memorable. The plot isn't as well thought out. It's just not as good overall.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
3,claudio_carvalho,A Great Sequel,8,9 April 2004,"John Connor (Nick Stahl) is an young man riding his motorcycle without destiny. He has an accident in the road and reaches Katherine Brewster`s (Claire Danes) veterinary clinic,  trying to get some medicine for his wounded leg. Meanwhile, a female terminator, called T-X or Terminatrix (Kristanna Loken), is chasing John as primary target and the other future members of the human resistance. Another T-101 (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is programmed by Kate in the future to protect John and is sent back to the present days. John and Kate, supported by the T-101, try to avoid the attack of the machines, shutting-down the computer network in an isolated mountain. Only today I have watched this movie. I really believed that it would not be worthwhile, but indeed it is a great sequel. I was afraid that this third part of this excellent story could be as terrible as the sequences of Matrix are, but using state-of-art special effects, lots of action scenes and a good story, it is an excellent entertainment.  The fans of Terminator movies will not be disappointed. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): `O Exterminador do Futuro 3: A Rebelião das Máquinas' (`The Terminator From the Future 3: The Rebellion of the Machines')",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
4,classicsoncall,"""They tried to murder me before I was born.""",8,2 March 2016,"The main problem I have with the films in the Terminator franchise is that they couldn't possibly happen given the time travel element involved. In this picture, Arnold's T-101 tells John Connor (Nick Stahl) that he'll see him again one day even as he's being destroyed by the T-X. OK, how? See what I mean.But I love the terminology. The T-X (Kristanna Loken) can control other machines, driven by a plasma reactor and carrying on board weapons with nanotechnological transistors designed to terminate other cybernetic organisms like the T-101. So it's an anti-Terminator, Terminator. How can you not love that analysis? I also got a bit of a kick out of Connor's use of a little Captain Kirk type logic when he reminded the T-101 (Arnold Schwarzenneger) of his mission to protect Kate (Claire Danes) and himself, after being corrupted by the T-X. That was kind of a weak argument to be using given the premise of the T-X in the first place, but I guess the film makers needed a little wiggle room for the story to pan out.So like the Terminator flicks that went before, this one appeals to me the most at the action and special effects level. The best was the T-X doing the complete 180 with her body, almost erotic in the execution if I must say. I know the T-X was supposed to be a potent killing machine, but it probably wouldn't have hurt if after one of her rampages she might have cracked a polymimetic smile.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
5,jboothmillard,Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,5,21 September 2005,"If a sequel was going to be made, then it should have had the same director as the first two, James Cameron, then maybe it would have been better than this attempt by Jonathan Mostow. Basically John Connor (Nick Stahl) has spent years hiding himself away from Skynet, no phone, no address and no destination. So instead of trying to find and kill him, the new advanced (female looking) villain machine, the T-X (Kristanna Loken) comes from 2029 to 2003 to kill his Connor's future commanders. She does eventually find Connot though, when after he broke into a pet store, run by Katherine 'Kate' Brewster (Romeo + Juliet's Claire Danes), she finds his blood (on a bandage), and she now on his hunt. Terminator also finds him and they are now on the run from the T-X. They do stop to Sarah Connor's grave (died of disease), but it is not her body, but a mound of guns. The Terminator tells them that they have to escape the blast of the nuclear missiles, which strike soon, and this will begin Judgement Day (which was only postponed), but John insists that they get to the place where Skynet will operate and take over, where Kate's father, Robert Brewster (David Andrews) is trying to stop it. In the end, after escaping the rampaging/attacking machines, and after the Terminator and T-X die together, John and Kate realise that they were not meant to stop Judgement Day, only to survive it in Crystal Peak. Also starring Mark Famiglietti as Scott Petersen and Earl Boen as a brief Dr. Peter Silberman. It is not brilliant like the other two, it is just an excuse for some giggles, the same stuff we've seen before with a few cool moments, and only Arnold Schwarzenegger returning as another good Terminator and the special effects are impressive. Worth watching!",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
6,ccthemovieman-1,"If You Liked ""Terminator 2,'"" You'll Like This",8,21 June 2006,"If you watched the first two movies in this ""series,"" particularly the second film, then most of this should be very familiar territory. You can expect to see more of the same, meaning:1 - Some spectacular action scenes; 2 - more action than is needed; 3 - A supposedly-unstoppable villain robot (this time a female); 3 - profane and somewhat annoying lead characters, except for Arnold, of course; 4 - seeing some naked butts (odd knowing one is the governor of Califronia); 5 - humor mixed in with all the violence; 6 - great overall special-effects and surround sound.The first 30 minutes of this movie was the best part, I thought. Overall, there was so much action it wore me out but it was a worthy sequel to the last movie. If you enjoyed watching what the ""bad cyborg"" Robert Patrick could do in the ""Terminator 2,"" you'll really be entertained by his successor, played by Kristannia Loken. Like Patrick, she doesn't say much....but doesn't have to. Schwarzenegger, meanwhile, performs admirably in his last starring role (I think) before tackling bigger responsibilities in real life.I hope there are no more re-makes because it wouldn't be the same without Arnold.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
7,rmax304823,"Snap, Crackle, Pop.",3,14 July 2015,"If it's worth doing at all, it's worth doing to excess. That is, if you're making a sequel to a sequel, why not make it bigger and add more of whatever excited the kids in the first place? Only, of course, Arnold must be a good guy.""The Terminator"" was kind of cute and fun, what with it's inventiveness, lack of preciosity, it's high-speed chases through night-time Los Angeles, and Arnold finally being turned into the robot he was always intended to be.This one sucks. The jokes aren't funny and they're self referential. The high-speed chases only pause for breath now and then. None of the characters convince, although Claire Danes is a decent actress with strong features a bit too fleshy to qualify as beautiful by Hollywood standards, one of the reasons I find her appealing. And, as I say, she can act too, as she did in Coppola's ""The Rain Maker."" But she has no more of a chance here than any of the other performers, maybe less because her character has been shoehorned into the plot.The explosions are bigger and better. And why not? As Mies Van Der Rohe said, ""More is more; and MORE is more and more.""",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
8,Tweekums,A decent third instalment that is full of action,8,16 November 2017,"It is ten years since the events of Terminator 2; Judgement Day did not take place and John Connor is a drifter rather than the saviour of humanity. At least that is what he thinks; as a virus plagues the internet the military plans to use Skynet to fight it soon two terminators will show up. The first is a new T-X model, this looks like a woman and is programmed to kill those destined to be John's lieutenants. The second is a T-850, the familiar model payed by Arnold Schwarzenegger, which has been programmed to ensure John survives Judgement Day. By coincidence John meets up with Kate Brewster, a girl he last saw the day before the events of the last film and destined to be an important part of his future, just as the T-X comes to kill her and the T-850 arrives to save him. They manage to escape but the T-X is never far behind and Kate takes some persuading to accept what is going on. Kate's father is the Air force officer who will release Skynet; John believes that they can get to him and stop Judgement Day again; the T-800 states that Judgement Day is inevitable.After a great original film and an impressive sequel this film has a lot to live up to so I can understand why plenty of Terminator fans aren't keen on this instalment. It isn't as good as the previous films but I still really enjoyed it. John Connor is no longer a smart Alec teen and his mother Sarah has died; the first detail is good news but the second is a pity as Sarah Connor was such a great character. Arnie's T-850 is much the same as he was in T2; which is good and I really liked the new T-X model terminator even if it seemed to break some of the rules established in previous films with her built in weapons. The action is almost non-stop with plenty of really impressive set pieces; most notably when the T-X chases her targets in a massive crane wreaking havoc along the way. Nick Stahl did a fine job as the slightly jaded Connor and Claire Danes impressed as Kate; I also liked Kristanna Loken's portrayal of T-X and as for Arnie well he is The Terminator so no complaints there. Overall an enjoyable addition to the franchise.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
9,ma-cortes,"Acceptable follow-up with thrills, chills and breathtaking action scenes",7,22 November 2020,"Passable sequel dealing with a young John Connor : Nick Stahl, nowadays, he is a druggie with no money who commits little thefts. One day, there appears a a machine from a post-apocalyptic future travelling back in time to execute a bloody mission, it is a new Terminator, an advanced robotic assassin, this time is female, Kristanna Loken, but the job is the same : to kill future resistance leader John Connor. But there also shows up again an old T 850, another Arnold-model, who was reprogramed by the human rebels as a bodyguard to ensue John Connor and his pal will survive a nearly nuclear attack . As John Connor's got a gal colleague, an old schoolmate : Claire Danes , they both survive by undertaking a dangerous assignment : to avoid The Doomsday.Acceptable follow-up with thrills, noisy action, overwhelming pursuits, car crashes, twists and turns. Here turns up a new cyborg TX that the machines reprogram to kill John Connor and replacing the old T 850 played by Arnold . While Linda Hamilton, heroine of the two previous entries, didn't want to go the buff body route again, as Sarah Connor unfortunately does not shows up. The film benefits itself from impressive scenes action and an unexpected, surprising and twisted final that goes on perfectly the thrilling saga. It packs a moving and rousing musical score by Marco Beltrani, including the classic leitmotif by Brad Fievel. As well as atmospheric and adequate cinematography by Don Burguess. The motion picture was professionally directed by Jonathan Mostow. He is a good professional who has made notable films for cinema as Surrogates, The hunter's prayer, U 571, Breakdown and TV as Flight of Black Angel, The Last Ship, From the Earth to the Moon, Them, among others.

10,BA_Harrison,Introducing the T-X.,8,3 December 2007,"Schwarzeneggar is back (he said he would be) as another T-1000 cyborg sent through time to protect the now grown up John Connor (Nick Stahl), and his future wife, Kate (Claire Danes), who are being stalked by the T-X (Kristanna Loken), the latest in murderous machines hellbent on destroying the human race.Rise Of The Machines might not be the (near) perfect juggernaut of an action sequel that was Cameron's Judgement Day, but as far as edge-of-the-seat, sci-fi fun goes, it's still bloody good! Director Jonathan Mostow certainly makes the most of his mega-budget, and delivers plenty of jaw-dropping mayhem along with loads of impressive special effects. And Schwarzenneggar does what he does best: blowing things up, shooting huge weapons, and delivering cheesy one-liners.The (mostly) smart script follows on nicely from The Terminator and T2, further developing the character of John Connor, neatly explaining away the absence of Linda Hamilton in a not-too-disappointing way, and brilliantly bringing the whole affair to a satisfying, and not altogether happy, conclusion. There is blistering action (a set piece involving a massive crane causing untold damage to umpteen cars and buildings is absolutely incredible), some nice touches of humour, and a bit of quite gruesome violence (for a DVD that is rated 12!).Sure, T3 isn't quite as good as its predecessors, but how many films are? Both the original The Terminator and T2 are extremely tough acts to follow. I think Rise Of The Machines does a pretty good job and deserves a lot more praise than it gets.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
11,paul_haakonsen,"Wait, there's yet another new terminator model?...",5,9 June 2018,"I thoroughly enjoyed ""The Terminator"" and ""Terminator 2"", so of course I was essentially thrilled when they released the third movie to the franchise. I watched it back in the day when it was released, and remember that it didn't make all that much of a lasting impression on me back then. So I got around to watching it again, just for kicks, you know...The storyline was adequate, although somewhat generic and too straight forward. ""Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines"" was very predictable, which was a shame, because it seemed like they just squandered all the potential that they had served on a silver platter.The movie does have good acting performances and certainly was nice to see Schwarzenegger back in this iconic role.The new terminator model, the T-X, seemed a bit too far out there, as if they had to surpass the model from the ""Terminator 2"" movie. And just how many different models of these robots are there?""Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines"" does offer lots of action, so you will be more than entertained in that department. The movie also have an abundance of good special effects and CGI, which of course are quite necessary for a Sci-Fi action movie such as this.All in all, an adequately entertaining movie, albeit not the best of additions to the franchise.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
12,Quinoa1984,"Arnold rules, but where's Cameron?",6,7 July 2003,"After leaving T3, and viewing T2 again over the holiday weekend, I realized the key thing that gives T1 and 2 the edge over this recent blockbuster. James Cameron, co-writer and director of those first two, knew right away how to do the action sequences, how to make them exciting, and even how to top himself in the sequel.  But what he was keen on was the story, the characters- for a world such so hard-edged and desolate as in these films, the overall humanity has to be all the more noticeable in order to feel for the main players.  Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines was made without anything to do with Mr. Cameron, and because of that there is a slight feeling of aloof, even as Jonathan Mostow and his writers try their best to make an impact on the saga of John Connor and the Machines.
Here's the good news- the action in this film is still exciting, in the sort of dumbdy-dumb dumb flow of this season of movies, and one of the pleasures of seeing Arnold Schwarzenegger in nearly all of his films is that he can bring a laugh and a grin at the most dire of sequences, not to mention his catch phrases (some are corny ""She'll be back"", others are amusing ""Talk to the hand"").  And the new Terminator (T-X), played in a strikingly impervious and sensual efficiency by Kristina Lokken, is a good counterpart for the model 101.The bad news is that there isn't as much to take in as far as interesting new roles and situations and such, the dialogue revels in cliches instead of juggling around with them as in the other 2, and the actors who play them aren't the wiser- Claire Danes as Kathryn Brewster is convincing to a point, pushing the thankless boundaries of the helpless maiden; Nick Stahl's Connor looks and acts as much like Edward Furlong as Jodie Foster looks and acts like Julianne Moore, and the purpose for Earl Boen's Dr. Silbermen is purely for gag value at this point.The story-line takes us in this chapter as that this is the new Judgment Day, with Sky-Net on a roll to domination.  Fair enough, but the writers don't overcome any of the subtle, and not so subtle plot-holes.  For instance(s), after the Terminator goes out of the funeral parlor with the casket, gets shot at by bullets that don't leave a mark on him (which did in the last films), he shoots back and explodes some cop cars and then reading on his monitor that there wasn't one human casualty.  The reasoning for the Terminator not committing any human casualties worked in part 2 since young John Connor made him swear not to kill anyone, and in this one it isn't the same Terminator as in that one, so why is he still an ""anti-terminator terminator""?  For an R-rating there is something fishy about Arnold as a semi-pacifist trapped inside of a cybornetic organism.  And Sarah Connor dying of leukemia in 1997 will be a bit of a contradiction as to what's mentioned in the T2 book.And yet, these I suppose are my problems with such a film, and I can guess I am probably not the only one with them.  Indeed even the most shallow of movie-goers will see this is the least effective of the three in the now Terminator trilogy.  But for this summer's crowd of movie-goers, being fed the assembly line of sequels and re-fashionings of part efforts, it's certainly not indigestible, and it may keep some hoping for a part 4.  As Mr. Connor says in the film, ""there is no fate but what we make of it"". Grade: B",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

16,Theo Robertson,Uninvolving And Dumb Franchise Movie,4,31 May 2009,"The original TERMINATOR showed what can be done via a relatively small budget and a very tight script and even today remains one of the finest thought proving films in the sci-fi genre . TERMINATOR 2 : JUDGEMENT DAY showed one of the problems with Hollywood and that is milk an idea for all it's worth . I can understand why many people enjoyed the sequel - everything is bigger , bolder but not better since sequels usually jettison things like intelligence and characterization , things that made the original so involving . With TERMINATOR 3 RISE OF THE MACHINES we see a very good example of why intelligent , involving films should never become a franchise First off we see the set up which is absolutely no different from JUDEMENT DAY . A new super dooper terminator ( T-X ) is sent back to the past to kill future resistance leaders so the human race send Arnie back to stop it . Bad enough Arnie is introduced in a humorous way in the sequel but here it's done in an entirely camp manner , almost self parody . Not only that there's ridiculous plot holes involved such as why wait hours before the nuclear war before killing the resistance leaders or having an obsolete terminator protecting John Connor and co ? Perhaps the lack of internal continuity is worse where the T-X steals a gun to kill its victims when it's later revealed that the T-X has the capability to shoot people with a ray-gun . It's one of these films where you're left with the impression that the screenwriters are making things up as they go alongThis is Summer blockbuster entertainment which unfortunately comes across as being very old hat . There's car chases , explosions and stunts . However between the release of films two and three in the franchise blockbuster entertainment had changed . No longer had films to rely on star power , not that Arnie was much of a big name in 2003 , nor did they have to rely on explosions . HARRY POTTER and LORD OF THE RINGS had become the new event movies , Anglophile films with literary sources . Watching overlong , loud chase sequences filled with explosions and zero plot and character development might have worked in the 1980s and 90s but had obviously become extinct at the turn of the century . When you're watching set piece action sequences whilst glancing at your watch this can only be an unmitigated failure There is one set piece that does work and that is when Skynet comes online and the newly developed weapons systems start exterminating their human creators . Indeed watching this sequence I was instantly struck as to how well the film could have worked if this had been the central core of the film . Don't bother writing iT-X or Arnie in to the movie , get rid of chase sequence and make a much darker , smaller budget film that contains drama . But I guess that would have been beyond the intelligence of Hollywood studios",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
17,jotix100,Hasta la vista baby. Arnie will be back again and again...,7,5 July 2003,"As summer films go, this is just about as good as they get. Missing though, was the vision of former Terminator director James Cameron's view on the subject, although this one has enough action going for it that no doubt, Jonathan Mostow will be back, perhaps on a movie of his own, so there will be no obvious comparisons with anyone.If by the end of the film, the viewer is not worn out by this action packed flick, I don't know where was he. Arnold will be Arnold, no matter where he appears. He is his own worst cliche. There are very funny touches in this version, especially when Arnold arrives at the beginning of the film and walks into the strippers joint. It was hilarious. The only thing now is we must wait a few more years for the next T4 film. What will happen if Arnold Schwarzenegger gets the nomination and is elected as governor of California? Will he go back to do another sequel? Let's hope there are enough millions on the table to convince Arnie to accept the challenge.

Then John learns that the threat of Skynet has not been stopped, merely postponed & with the new Judgement Day fast approaching he decides to try & prevent it, again.This American, German & British co-production was directed by Jonathan Mostow (apparently with the likes of Ang Lee, Ridley Scott & James Cameron being asked but turning it down) & is obviously the second sequel to James Cameron's superb sci-fi action hit The Terminator (1984), Cameron himself also wrote & directed the sequel Terminator 2: Judgement Day (1991) which is quite simply one of the greatest films ever, period. So with two such illustrious predecessors that quite rightly consider solid gold classics how does Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines hold up? Well the script takes the basic concept from Terminator 2: Judgement Day & goes with that, two Terminators sent back from the future, one to protect Connor the other to kill him, Connor trying to destroy Skynet & prevent Judgement Day from ever happening & a parade of big budget set-piece action scenes. Compared to the first two terminator film Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines isn't as good but I still found it enjoyable in it's own right & competing against two of the best films of all time is pretty difficult to do anyway. The makers seem to have changed the character of John Connor & what he was about, from a rebellious & resourceful youngster to a bit of a bland loser, the two Terminator's aren't played as emotionless androids either with both spouting various one-liners & making faces which is alright but doesn't seem right & while the story is fine it's nothing more than a rehash of ideas from the first two & doesn't take the franchise forward at all & by comparison to Cameron's films this is a little soulless. Having said that Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines entertained me no end, I loved the new female Terminator (even though she feels like a gimmick), it moves along like a rocket & there are some terrific action set-pieces including an amazing car chase involving a huge crane. There are loads of explosions, fights, shoot-outs, car chases, pure wanton destruction & cool effects to keep me happy anyway. Sure Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines isn't the greatest film ever plot wise but there's enough going on elsewhere to enjoy to make this well worth a watch in my opinion.The CGI computer effects are good & there are some terrific action sequences which is where Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines excels. The crane chase is a real stand-out moment & one of my all time favourite car chases featuring lots of explosions, outrageous stunts & general vehicular mayhem on a grand scale. Despite an 'R' rating in the US this got away with a '12' here in the UK & it does feel a little bit family friendly with the absolute minimum of violence shown which may not be a problem to most but I am a bit of a violence junkie & I missed it since we got violence in spades in the first two. While not as menacing as either Scwarzenegger from the first or Robert Partick from the second film Kristanna Locken is hot & looks totally gorgeous in her red leather catsuit, OK so I'm a shallow male what can I say? I loved any scene she was in & she has a real sexy & dangerous femininity about her although her special powers aren't that much of a step forward from those seen in Terminator 2: Judgement Day. There are nods & gags to the original two films that seem a little forced but are quite fun from Arnie's sunglasses to an amusing cameo by Earl Bohen reprising his role as Dr. Silberman.With a supposed budget of $170,000,000 you can see where the money went with virtual non stop action & flashy CGI effects, you certainly get your money's worth here. The film is well made but doesn't have Cameron's cold & stylish look & I really missed Brad Fiedel's stirring music that has been replaced by a much more forgettable & generic sounding soundtrack. The acting is alright, Schwarzenegger is OK, Stahl is bland, Danes is alright after having replaced Sophia Bush at short notice after a few days filming while Kristanna Locken was cast for her looks & excels in that department at least.Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines was never going to exceed it's predecessors which in my (& many other's) humble opinion are two of the greatest films ever made but for what it is I really enjoyed it. So sue me. The telly series Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles (2008 - 2009) totally ignores the events of this while a fourth film Terminator Salvation (2009) has just opened.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
19,zardoz-13,Talk to the Hand!!!,8,6 February 2008,"Audacious adrenaline-laced action sequences, a resolute refusal to take itself seriously, and a surprise finale help the new apocalyptic Arnold Schwarzenegger science fiction epic ""Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines"" overcome its flat, formulaic, road show plot with its loquacious pseudo-scientific gobbledygook. No, director Jonathan Mostow's ""T-3"" doesn't top James Cameron's 1991 classic ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day."" Although ""T-3"" lacks the narrative depth and complexity of ""T-2,"" this $170 million sequel based on Cameron's characters boasts more than enough muscle, mayhem, and momentum to make it worth watching though not altogether memorable. Mostow, who directed the W. W. II submarine saga ""U-571"" and the Kurt Russell wife-napping nail-biter ""Breakdown,""calls the shots this time and acquits himself well enough, considering how shallow the John Brancato & Michael Ferris screenplay remains throughout its lean, mean 109 minute running time. Aside from brawny Arnold Schwarzenegger as the protagonist, Earl Boen as Dr. Silverman qualifies as the only holdover from previous ""Terminator"" movies. Warner Brothers dumped Edward Furlong, whose real-life drunken antics cost him the John Connor role, and the studio replaced him with brooding-looking Nick Stahl of ""Bully"" and ""In The Bedroom."" Unfortunately, Stahl lacks any kind of charisma and he shares no chemistry with Claire Danes. For the record, Linda Hamilton as Sarah Connor has taken the long hike, too.The nuts and bolts John Brancato & Michael Ferris screenplay (their credits include ""The Game"" and ""The Net"") picks up the plot about 10 years after ""T-2."" Leukemia has claimed Sarah Connor's life, and her grown-up son John (Nick Stahl) struggles to blend into the background and lives life ""off the grid."" He suspects that the future still holds something sinister for him, and he's right. As in ""T-2,"" ""T-3"" opens with a new Terminator, this time a Terminatrix, the T-X (svelte-looking super model Kristanna Loken of ""Academy Boyz""), stalking not only him but also those slated to act as his future lieutenants. Clearly, Mostow and his scribes must have seen Lara Flynn Boyle's mutant bug villainess in ""Men In Black 2"" and liked the idea. Like Robert Patrick's Terminator in ""T-2,"" this Terminatrix sports a new generation of liquid-metal skin as well as a lethal limb that she can turn into a plasma cannon, stiletto probe and power saw. As villainess go, this bombshell robo-babe is truly bad to the bone! She can crank up parked cars from afar and send them careening off down the road as if they were remote control toys. And she is not out to take prisoners either! This Terminatrix gives new meaning to stereotype about reckless women drivers in an early chase scene when she hijacks a gigantic construction crane truck and demolishes half of Los Angeles trying to run down John Connor. One of those lieutenants on her hit list is mild-mannered veterinarian Kate Brewster (Claire Danes of ""Brokedown Palace""). It seems that Kate and John shared a romantic moment together back in their high school days. Actually, it was the day before John's foster parents were mysteriously murdered and he vanished without a trace. The coincidences get even better. Now, it also seems that Kate's papa is a three-star general in charge of Skynet, an ultra-sophisticated computerized defense system which eventually out-smarts mankind and sends machines out to kill, kill, kill. No sooner has the action in ""T-3"" unfolded than things go on the Fritz. Least we not forget, in the middle of all this madness, another Terminator shows up in the form of Arnold Schwarzenegger. No, not the same one who died at the end of ""T-2,"" but he is just as obsolete as his earlier incarnation compared with the new Terminator. Nevertheless, Arnold makes life difficult for the Terminatrix. Kristanna Loken makes a terrific Terminatrix, too.""Terminator 3: Rise of the Machine"" ranks as one of the most physically exhausting movies you'll see. You'll feel bruised and battered, especially after the battle between the two cyborgs in the bathroom. When was the last time you saw somebody tear an entire urinal out of the wall and smash somebody over the head with it? One of my favorite scenes occurred in the police cruiser when the Terminatrix --masquerading as Scott Mason—shoves her fist through the detective's chest and drives the car. Sadly, ""T-3"" doesn't provide Arnold with near enough clever one-liners as he had as either ""Terminator"" (1984) or ""T-2,"" but ""T-3"" still packs a hugely entertaining punch. Arnold's favorite like is ""Talk to the hand."" Mostow stages a memorable entrance for Arnold. He saunters into a bar during ladies night without a stitch on and insists that the male stripper give him all his clothes. The firefight at Greenlawn Cementery is interesting, too. When Arnold emerges from the crypt carrying the casket like a stick on his shoulder, the image reminded me of the Spaghetti western hero named Django who drags a coffin behind him with a machine gun in it. Incidentally, Arnold is toting not only firearms but also John Connor. The worst thing you can say about ""T-3"" is that it is a high-octane, swiftly-paced, straightforward melodrama with little of its predecessor's wit and wisdom. On the other hand, if you relish break-neck action movies with a high quota of slam-bang auto crashes, trigger-happy shoot-outs, and an over-the-top, face-to-face confrontation between two larger-than-life cyborgs titans, you should catch ""T-3"" on the big-screen!",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
20,grantss,Not bad. Not that good either.,6,29 March 2014,"Not bad. Not that good either. The third instalment of the Terminator franchise, and the first not directed by James Cameron. The change of director doesn't make much difference. As with the first two movies, it's all about style rather than substance, special effects rather than a watertight plot.Plot isn't that bad, however, just kind of formulaic. Performances are so-so. Arnold Schwarzenegger isn't there because for the Shakespearean soliloquies but just action scenes and cheesy one- liners, and he does those well. Nick Stahl is badly cast as John Connor - he's no action hero. Claire Danes' performance is the best of the bunch. Then again, she is easily the best actor in the cast. Kristanna Loken...looks good.Overall, not a terrible waste of time. Moves along at a good pace and it's a reasonably fun ride.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
21,Boba_Fett1138,"Not as good as I had hoped, not as bad as I had feared.",7,20 March 2006,"This was a real 'middle of the road' movie. It was not as good as I had hoped but it also was not as bad as I had feared at the same time. Like most other people, I was skeptical about this movie. I mean Terminator 3 without James Cameron and Robert Patrick as villain but an yet inexperienced director and girl as villain instead? I feared the worst but at the same time I hoped that the movie might become as good as it's predecessors ""Terminator"" and ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"". It surely had the potential and budget for that. In the end ""Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines"" might not be as good as the previous two Terminator movies but at least it's just as enjoyable.Basically this movie is just a great action-flick. I already knew that Jonathan Mostow was capable of directing a good action movie after seeing ""U-571"", so I might not had been as skeptical as most others about Mostow directing this movie. ""Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines"" also is a wonderfully directed action movie that has some highly memorable and well constructed action sequences in it. It really is due to Mostow's skills that this movie is better than the average action-flick. The movie features so great shootouts, fistfights and car chases, of which the one with the large crane truck the most memorable one. The high budget is notable in the movie and lots of stuff blows up and gets demolished. Budget well spend in this case, I say!It's not the story that makes this movie a good one. Even though it by no means is a bad story, it just lacks any real depth and emotion. The movie however sets things nicely up for a ""Terminator 4"" movie. I for one, am really looking forward to this movie, if it ever gets made. I also certainly wouldn't mind seeing Jonathan Mostow returning to direct, if James Cameron is not available/won't do it.The movie is well cast. Arnold Schwarzenegger reprises his role of 'The Terminator'. He however is given a lot more dialog this time, which perhaps was not the most wise choice, since Arnie's acting skills are highly below average. But perhaps that's also part of the charm. He yet again delivers some cheesy one-liners and the movie as a whole is surprisingly comical at times, especially when compared to the previous two Terminator movies. I think it's great that they actually picked an actor to play John Conner, who actually looked like Edward Furlong, who played John Conner in ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"". Nick Stahl is a great new John Conner. He also has some nice chemistry with his love interest played by Claire Danes. Kristanna Loken tries very hard to surpass Robert Patrick's performance from ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" but she unfortunately hasn't got enough charisma for that.The movie is just nothing more than an awesome action flick. Action movie fans will absolutely love this movie. But the movie does get a git unnecessary violent at times. The movie features lots of killing of innocent persons. It's a bit too much and over-the-top perhaps at times, even for my taste, even though I'm used to seeing a lot worse in some movies. This movie simply just didn't needed that. The special effects of the movie are just great and work convincing. The nice action musical score is from Marco Beltrami. Marco Beltrami is a great and talented action movie composer that hasn't yet got the recognition which he deserves.Perhaps not as impressive and good as the previous two Terminator movies but as an action-flick this movie is just totally awesome!7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
22,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Fall of the Series,5,3 December 2008,"After two excellent films(if anyone is contesting that, hey, I'll hear you out, just be sure to bring impeccable points against them... or it can of course be a matter of taste, which there's no accounting for, and I have no beef with anyone who uses that as a reason to not care for them) we get... this. No, really, *this*. What is it? Does it even know, itself? It's certainly not a Terminator film. Do I even need to explain that one? Take a look at pretty much any moment of it and compare to, yes, any of the earlier two. Go ahead. I'll wait. In the meantime, let's go over what else this could be: A parody of the others? Yes, that really could be it. Was the self-irony in T2 not the exact right amount and tone? Did anyone want what this had in that area? Even if you do laugh at the initial sunglasses bit, you're likely to, a second or so later, go ""wait a minute..."", and that's not the last of it. Add to that, there is a Road Runner gag in this. You think I'm kidding? Check for yourself, around half an hour in. The ""humor"" largely consists of stupid stereotypes, trying to get cheap laughs. No... in truth, I know what this is. A popcorn flick. And it shouldn't be. Like its predecessors, it's got action, and it's big. Unfortunately, now you can also add ""dumb"" and ""loud"" to that description, and that does not belong in the universe of these. You want that type of cinema experience? Heck, go for it. I do, too. But that is not what this franchise is. The shoot-outs and car-chases are simply not that exciting, and every time this tries to recreate or mimic something in one of the previous entries, it's awful at worst, and dull, never reaching the height of them, at best. The script is daft. It holds a handful of interesting concepts or ideas, however, none are terribly utilized or followed through. More noticeable are the times that the writing is convenient. And somehow, after a kind of light, easy to take in running time, this ends in a depressing(not to mention abrupt, unsatisfying and pointless) way(sadly, Boen's role in this can be described that way, as well). I agree with what Hamilton said when she declined this. You can tell James Cameron had no direct hand in this. I will say that the effects are mostly well-done, though a few are hideous. The character of Kate was annoying and unnecessary. John manages to have a higher pitched voice than he did as a 13-year-old(!) at times in this. The acting varies, it's not all bad. The leads do convincingly(fingers ought to be pointed at the screenplay, instead). They didn't particularly think of anything new for the the cyborg. And before anyone asks if I could come up with such, hey, maybe not, meanwhile, you do not see me going out and making a sequel to T1 and 2. Kristanna did give this an effort, and clearly got into it, and the fault does not lie with her. The T-X is instantly and infinitely obvious in why that was their choice. Did they have to stoop to that level? There are at least three separate occurrences that were put there for no other purpose than to attract male teenagers, and could be taken out with no loss to the rest of it(the key-words give clues). Thus this is the first of these to have aspects that are gratuitous. The sexuality, the nudity, the language, the violence, heck, the whole bloody thing. Apart from cashing in, why was this released? The DVD has some specials, including a marvelous documentary, outtakes(fairly low on the list of hilarity-to-length ratio, if you ask me), featurettes(one with Todd MacFarlane, who is a blast to listen to and view), a commentary track(they're informative enough) with only Mostow, and one where he's joined by Arnie, Stahl, Danes and Loken(although they're recorded separately, so there is little to no back-and-forth). For that last one, I'd go with the Director's Cut of Judgment Day's, instead: The track for that is an interesting case... it contains almost thirty(!) people, and while that obviously seems quite bombastic, it's handled well. There is a main speaker, and it would appear that everyone else who says anything has done so in interviews, and the parts that fit with specific stuff(shots, sounds, effects) are then put in here, briefly introduced(occasionally after they've already spoken) by the... producer or who it was. I'd give that a listen if you care for such. Back to what there is on the discs of this...They range in quality, but I'd say that the one that stands out, to me, anyway, the sole thing that even begins to justify the existence of this, is the Sgt. Candy Scene. I'd watch that even if you have no other contact with this. I recommend this to those not attached in any way to the prior movies that share a title with this, and/or people looking for something to turn their brain off to. I don't have a problem with entertainment pieces of that sort come to be, nor that they sell(again, I am one of the buyers), I merely object to using this established name for that. 5/10",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
23,view_and_review,T3 is a solid follow up to a classic,8,30 January 2007,"T3 was actually very good. Put it this way, if we had never been treated to the classic and innovative T2, I believe a lot more people would have been in love with T3. T3 was looking at some serious obstacles: 1.) following up T2, a monster success 2.) an aging Arnold Schwarzenegger 3.) making a cohesive story that wouldn't contradict the former Terminators 4.) making a better terminator than the T-1000.As I said before, they followed up T2 respectably enough. There were good fight scenes with the T-800 and the T-X (I particularly like the fight in the bathroom), and there was an excellent car chase scene near the beginning. The action was good and plentiful, the effects were nice, and there was some good humor in the movie as well.Arnold was still in shape enough and made up enough to be believable. Of course he wore the leather jacket the entire movie. Not only that, he was an older Terminator model anyway, so any signs of stiffness or slow wittedness could easily be blamed on that.The story flowed well. John Connor (Nick Stahl) was again the focus except he is now a bit more subdued and scared. In his attempts to stay out of any electronic systems, he chooses a horrible life of joblessness, homelessness, and just plain bumming it. He was complimented by a much smarter, cleaner, and stronger partner, Kate Brewster (Claire Danes); she was tied into the story rather well. They stayed true to the Armageddon type story line and even had a bit of misdirection at the end to make the movie even more interesting.The T-X model terminator (Kristanna Loken) was nice. Sure, they chose a beautiful woman for the T-X, but she was not to be trifled with. The T-X had the same shape shifting abilities as her predecessor (the T-1000) but she also had abilities to control anything that had a CPU and she could form her hand into a variety of weapons. Similar to the T-1000 (Robert Patrick of T2), the T-X (Loken) took the T-800 (Schwarzenegger) to town, but she was a bit more dangerous even than the T-1000.T3 was a solid movie for a third installment. Usually by the third sequel you are begging Hollywood to stop, but I can't say that about this movie. This movie is good enough to watch more than once.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
24,evanston_dad,I'll Take a Terminatrix to Go Please,7,19 November 2008,"Common consensus seems to be that ""Terminator 3"" is the weakest in the series, and maybe it is. But I actually really liked this movie.Claire Danes is no Linda Hamilton, but that's o.k., since we get the Terminatrix, a brand spanking new female cyborg that's virtually unstoppable. I kept waiting for her to begin firing bullets from her boobs like that android in the ""Austin Powers"" movie. People don't seem to like that this film went for a lighter, more comic tone. But come on -- how seriously is anyone expected to take this story? The screenplay also has a reflexive quality to it, with Arnold the actor, feeling his age as an action movie star, playing an old and outdated model of cyborg, who can't keep up with the new times.Grade: B+",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
25,ferguson-6,Hope that red light is out for good,6,18 July 2003,"Greetings again from the darkness.  I absolutely loved the first Terminator and thought the sequel was one of the best sequels ever made (outside of ""Godfather II"").  Arnold was born to play this role and seems to enjoy it. However, the act is a bit tired now - and Arnold is looking a little wrinkled for a robot.  Anyway, decent story with Nick Stahl (""In the Bedroom"") as a 20 something John Conner and the always wonderful Claire Danes as the female fill in for the not present Linda Hamilton.  I am really glad Danes is acting full time again.  Although it has been almost 10 years since her TV breakout, she is just now coming in to her own as an actress. ""The Hours"" and ""Igby Goes Down"", along with this performance show she is trying to find her niche.  Very skilled and not bad to look at, the next few roles are crucial to her career as either a star or character actress.  I just hope she continues to produce quality turns.  Model Kristanna Loken is the T-X, or Terminatrix (get it?) who is after John Conner.  A far more powerful and efficient killing machine than Arnold, but somehow she continually falls just short.  Not sure how director Johnathan Mostow (""U-571"") lucked into this gig, but at least he doesn't muck it up.  This is just a story that has had its day and should be appreciated for what it gave us.

26,anaconda-40658,Rise of the Screenwriters.,3,16 July 2015,"Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (2003): Dir: Jonathan Mostow / Cast: Arnold Schwarzenegger, Nick Stahl, Claire Danes, Kristanna Loken, David Andrews: Money all over the screen without a shred of screenplay worth its budget. It is about man at the mercy of what he created. In this case the audience must suffer for what was created here. It repeats the same exhausted setup with hero and villain terminators falling to earth. What follows are endless scenes of violence with an ending that bears reference to the much better original. Director Jonathan Mostow previously made a much better thriller in Breakdown but here it is the production that matters. This is easily the worst film in the franchise and nowhere near as good or even provocative as the original film. Arnold Schwarzenegger is still effective as the terminator sent to protect John Connor and Kate Brewster but the issue here is that he is merely reciting what he has done before and better. Kristanna Loken as a female terminator is a great thought but its seductive nature is nothing more than a joke. Nick Stahl and Claire Danes as John and Kate are hardly interesting. They have all the personality of a rusty nail. The film exists mainly for its budget if anything at all. It seems to terminate everything else. Linda Hamilton's presence is sadly missing but then again, so is the screenwriter's. Score: 3 / 10",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

Once again though a familiar face(Arnold of course!) is sent back one last time to protect him(or is he?) Fantastic action punctuates this intriguing story about inevitable fate that cannot be shaped the way the Connors had hoped(Sarah is absent here...) but that one can certainly be prepared for.

After failing twice, SkyNet sends their most advanced machine to date, to not only kill John, but his future wife as well. Once again, a Terminator is sent to protect John and his future wife, and has a small upgrade which allows it to mimic humans more. Not knowing how these terminators were sent, considering he thought he destroyed SkyNet, John will soon learn something that will change his life.......The film is literally a meal ticket for Schwarzenegger, Judgment Day pretty much wrapped everything up for most fans, but there's always something about seeing Arnold in his defining role once more.Enjoy it as a Big Bang blockbuster and you will get something out of this,the set pieces are notable, especially the vehicle chase that unites John and The Terminator.But there are many, many flaws to the movie. The humour is out of place, and as soon as The Terminator puts in those glittery sunglasses, it either makes or breaks the movie. It's as if there is a little pause every time The Terminator is about to say something funny like 'talk to the hand' and so on.The inclusion of Dr. Silberman seems good at first, but them it just turns into self referential parody.Although the movie was costly, it looks somewhat cheap. Even though some of the effects are wonderful, it's not as cinematic as Cameron's two outings.And then there's Loken as the T-X. Let's just say she was born to play a robot, she's awful, and brings the movie down a couple of notches.Schwarzenegger saves the movie, he's still (just) got it to make a convincing Terminator, and it's his movie, plain and simple.Its nothing compared to the first two, but its worth watching just to see Schwarzenegger.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
29,Aaron1375,"Great Sci-Fi action movie, better than I expected.",9,19 July 2003,"I thought this one would be pretty good, but the previews did not really convey how good it turned out to be.  I also thought it would be that good thanks to its relatively short running time.  It turns out this helps the movie flow really fast and you never find yourself wondering how much time is left.  At least it didn't for me.  This one has Arnold as the Terminator once again being sent back in time to save Conner from an evil Terminator. Well I guess it isn't evil as it is a machine.  Well anyway this time the Terminator doesn't have to long to protect John as the war to end the world, as we know it is really close.  This one is just a great action movie, probably the best one I have seen this entire summer of 2003.  There is a great car chase, one that is even better than the Matrix Reloaded, mainly cause it looks more real, like it is actually happening in a city rather than a road Hollywood built (don't get me wrong though, that one was cool too) and there are other numerous scenes in this one that just keep your attention to the screen.  The T-X is rather cool, but I just don't see her being superior to the T-1000, as it seemed a lot harder to destroy.  Though I thought Kristen did a rather good job similar to Robert Patrick (I think that was his name).  The movie explains some of the plot points I was wondering about too, all in all this movie was very enjoyable and had quite a few humorous moments as well.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
30,zetes,"Falls short of the first two in intelligence, but it's excellent summer fare",8,5 July 2003,"It doesn't quite reach the levels of the first two installments, and, indeed, it often seems like little more than a quick cashing in on those films, but Terminator 3, for everything it's not, proves to be one of the most entertaining summer blockbusters in recent memory. The action sequences are a lot of fun; they are unbelievable and preposterous, but that doesn't detract from the visceral entertainment they provide. The Terminator and his enemy, the T-X, get the hell banged out of them as they are hit by numerous vehicles, are thrown about, and live through enormous explosions. The T-X does lack the menace of Arnold Schwarzenegger's original Terminator and the liquid terminator of T2, but, heck, I'm all about sexy terminatrices. Kristanna Loken is not a good actress, but she's sexy. She gets to wear red leather through the whole movie, and she can even increase her bust size on command. This film has a great B-movie quality to it in that way. An element of humor has been added to this film. In a way, I like the seriousness of the first two films. Terminator is a study in narrative economy, and it doesn't take time out to joke. Terminator 2 sticks to its convictions, however paranoid, and that was refreshing for a film of its type. Terminator 3 is a little smarmy with its humor, but, for the most part, its jokes succeeded in making me laugh. I love how he gets his leather jacket in this movie is very funny. I could have done without the endless parodying of Schwarzenegger's famous lines from the first two films, especially `I'll be back,' which has a dozen variations here. As for the acting, not much is required, of course. I'm very upset that Ed Furlong isn't back for this one. What better did he have to do? Nick Stahl is a poor replacement, and this is probably my major complaint with the movie. Clair Danes is a weird creature. I've always been biased against her ever since she starred in My So Called Life. She isn't a particularly good actress, but she's been improving, however slowly. What's especially odd is that she's actually getting more and more gawky as she ages. She was beautiful as a teenager, and, while still very attractive, I'd take the younger version. I suppose it's unfair to critique her looks. Her performance is fine. Nothing special, as with the other actors.

31,mm-39,Best movie so far this summer!,7,6 July 2003,"Spoilers!!  The original is a classic that I have seen one too many times, which made Arnold.  The second film, left its science fiction roots, and became a special effects film, without much of a story. A lot of films have plot holes, but how could John Conners exist without the first film happening. No bratty kid, social cause and effects(ie the security guard why don't I kill, the science guy change of mind), Linda Hamilton giving a PC social lecture, and effects with no need like the truck scene.  T3 had to change from the first 2, and this makes it a strong film. The over the top action scenes add humor for the film.  Arnold acts more like a machine, and becomes a strong secondary character; smart move for Arnold.  It shows he can step back for the good of the film. Arnold's computer behavior is comical!  Most science fiction has philosophy, and this film deals with fatalism.  This film answers the question why does John Conner exist.  As a result of fate, the second film only delayed the inevitable.  One must deal with their fate. Chaos theory with free will creates order to chaos and events unfold.  The strongest part of this film is the believability with the science fiction. In 1984, Sky Net takes over, was science fiction, but with the net, and the grid cyber war, it is possible.  This would damage the financial, power, communications system etc.  I watched a show about cyber war on the Learning Channel, with what the  NSC could do and with Sky net and the virus it is plausible.  Add the sci-fi, time travel and anything is possible.  The ending is mind blowing with fatalism.  7 or 8 out 10.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

A couple questions here and there. Arnold again? No, uh uh. How many terminators are there that look like Arnold? And he's lost his edge. It's getting kind of scary that he keeps on trying to act cool. For the T-X(can't remember her name), she did a good job considering what parts she was against. No one can compare to Robert Patrick's performance. But she did have a sinister edge. John Conor(can't remember his name), was alright. I couldn't really get into his charactor as much as I did with Eddie's performance in the 2nd terminator. And Claire Danes!? Eww. She's a horrible actress. I didn't mind her too much.

36,MovieAddict2016,"Coming from a sick fan who's been waiting a minimum of five years to see this film, let me tell you...it doesn't disappoint!",7,21 July 2003,"A little low-budget film named ""The Terminator"" hit the streets in 1984. This extremely low-budget actioner was about a machine ""terminator"" sent back in time to assassinate, or ""terminate"" the soon-to-be mother of the future world resistance leader, who would fight back against Skynet's machines who would fight for their dominance of the earth.19 years later, and one sequel later, comes ""Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,"" the massive differences between the original film being the budget, special effects, and action pieces. Being a long-time ""Terminator"" fan, of both ""T1"" and ""T2,"" I can tell you this baby don't disappoint. I have been one of those nerds on the Internet who had an old desktop wallpaper that said ""T3: Summer 2002"" on it. I have been waiting for this flick for years and years and years, a minimum of five years at least. When production finally started, and was delayed to 2003, and started again, I held my breath and expected the best. After the trailer I expected the worst. Now I got the best. This film blows you away, it's the best sequel of the year and James Cameron's absence from the film, though visible, doesn't hinder it.Judgment Day never happened. The world never got hit by nuclear bombs, the machines took over, and now a twenty-something John Connor lives ""off the grids,"" with no home, no telephone, no nothing. Just in case the machines happen to take over one day in the future and try to assassinate him again.Of course, the machines DO come back again, as without them there would be no sequel. One is a sexy terminator called the Terminatrix (Kristanna Loken), whose mission is to assassinate John Connor's future lieutenants and his future wife, a current veterinarian, Kate Brewster (Claire Danes), since the machines can't find where John Connor is (that's where the off-the-grid stuff comes in handy for him). However, John Connor happens to meet up with Kate Brewster the same night the TX tries to kill her (and now him since he is a primary target for termination), but the T-800 model cyborg (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is also back to protect them, who has been sent back in time by Kate Brewster in the future after the protection cyborg murdered John Connor...in the future, that is...err...confused yet?Wow, what a thrill ride. Give me a moment to catch my breath. Action non-stop throughout, great special effects, everything. It's nowhere near as great as the first two films, but as far as summer sequels go, this ranks in as one of the best.Arnold is back in fine form after ""End of Days"" (I liked ""The 6th Sense"" and ""Collateral Damage""), and for a brief moment in the film (when he throws Kate into the back of a truck), the way he is outlined against the night sky makes him look just like he did in the first film. His haircut is very much the same in that shot. Anywho, he's back.Nick Stahl takes over for druggie Edward Furlong in this installment, and by George he is great! Claire Danes doesn't do much but scream and run around and look pretty, but there's more purpose for her being there than in most movies like this.Like I said before, James Cameron's absence from the film IS visible, but new director Jonathan Mostow does a great job of taking over from him. The film is lacking some of the human elements that made the first so great, and it feels more like a regular action blockbuster than the predecessors. ""T2"" set a new level for action films; ""T3"" is more of a follower than a revolutionary film such as the first two. The special effects are impressive, but just like all the other films out there nowadays. ""T3"" in no way is as vicious, dark, or amazing as the first two films, which are both some of my favorite films, but Jonathan Mostow has done a great job handling Cameron's baby, and it shows, making ""T3"" neither disappointing nor bad; it's the best film of the summer, and one of the best action films in a long line of dull flicks. And in conclusion, I can honestly say that he'll be back. Trust me. So stick around. When he's back, I'll be back. But for now, hasta la vista, baby.4/5",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

38,KineticSeoul,"Not as groundbreaking as the 2nd one, but still passable",7,8 May 2011,"This is a decent movie, but since the previous two movies in this franchise are amazing. This movie just comes off a bit mediocre for the most part, but it still has entertainment value. It might have been better if James Cameron directed this one as well, but it's still a passable movie in the franchise. The plot of this movie is basically about how John Connor starts to become the leader the previous movies talked while building a relation with a girl, although the alteration doesn't really get completed. Even if this isn't a groundbreaking movie like the 2nd movie in the franchise and is a bit shorter, it doesn't try to be something it's not. The pacing is pretty fast and the action sequences are entertaining to watch. The movie however lack the gritty and suspenseful aspects from the previous movies and comes off a bit too silly at times. The connection between the two previous movies is done pretty well and is far from being a bad movie. It just isn't as great or good as the previous 2 movies in the franchise. Just don't expect too much after watching T2 or you might be disappointed. However the main negative aspect is how this movie doesn't seem all that legit and looked a bit cheap despite the big budget that went into this. Arnold is good with this role as before, but the guy that played John Connor sorta sucked and didn't fit the image of the leader of the resistance.7.6/10",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
39,OllieSuave-007,"It's OK, just missed the mark.",6,16 May 2014,"It was nice seeing Arnold Schwarzenegger back in action as the Terminator for this movie, still fresh and funny with his funny one-liners and quick wit, and still proving he can kick some major butt. The events of Terminator 2 have only delayed the completion of Skynet, which has sent the evil T-X (Kristanna Loken) to assassinate the future officers of TechCom and eliminate drifter John Connor (Nick Stahl). But the Resistance sends a T-800 (Schwarzenegger) from the future to the present time to protect drifter John Connor (Nick Stahl) and stop T-X.This film has the same destitute, war-fearing atmosphere as in the previous films. There are some intense action and cool special effects that highlight a slew of spectacular new weaponry the Terminator and T-X possess. The cast of characters is nicely assembled, with Stahl and and Claire Danes doing a decent job in portraying John Connor and Kate Brewster. The plot, however, lacks the urgency and suspense of the previous films and didn't have much character development, which would have made the characters more memorable and sympathized; you don't learn much from their backgrounds. The story didn't offer much originality - it basically rehashed SkyNet's continued threat to make Judgement Day happen, making this film just a mesh of action with limited drama.Overall, Terminator 3 is a lot of sci-fi action fun, but misses the mark in story and character developments.Grade C",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
40,thesar-2,"Talk to the hand! No, really...",2,11 October 2009,"Well, so much for ""No fate but what we make."" 'Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines' proved that we're not up to our own destiny as 'T2' proved otherwise. Be prepared for all the events in the previous installment to be thrown out the window in 'T3.' The perfect comparison is the transition from 'Aliens' to 'Alien 3.' (By the way, I don't think there's much of a coincidence that both 'T3' and 'Alien 3' are bad movies that followed part 2's directed by James Cameron; apparently no one knows how to follow him up, or even if they should.) (Spoiler following) In 'Aliens' Ripley spends the entire movie protecting Newt, Hicks and Bishop and stopping once and for all the alien race only to have 'Alien 3' open with Newt & Hicks dead, Bishop to die later and the aliens breeding again like nothing happened. 'T2' taught us, we are in charge of our future, and 'T3' says, ""nope, the set future is 'inevitable.'"" And I haven't gotten to the worst aspect (even worse than the dialogue, 'Talk to the hand!'): this is one of the most pointless sequels of all time. It's almost a line-by-line, shot-by-shot remake of 'T2.' Schwarzenegger is a good T-101 sent back to protect Connor, and a liquid metal Terminator sent back to kill him. There's the daylight street chase. There's the gun round-up. The one-liners (only, in 'T3' they were extremely painful to listen to.) Etc, etc. I give it an extra ½ star for the special effects. Unfortunately everything else – the acting, dialogue, originality, inconsistencies, plot holes, laughable characters (that were supposed to be taken seriously), was so far under par, it was unbelievable Cameron even let this get green-lit. And trust me: you'll feel every bit of Hamilton's absence.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
41,cherold,"lots of fun, though no T2",7,18 June 2004,"If you go into this expecting a fun action picture that is not going to be at the level of the first two movies, you'll probably have a good time. There are some fun action scenes, a fair amount of amusing jokes referring to the previous movie and a really hot evil robot played by a model whose vacuous model stare works perfectly in the role.But no, it's not as good as the first two. Those movies moved like lightning, offering a breakneck speed that kept you from catching your breath. T2 was a thrill ride from beginning to end, and T3 never works up that sort of momentum. Its holes are easier to pick at than the previous movies (although not terrible by action movie standards) and the ending is downright disappointing. But if rather than comparing it with two of the best action films ever made, you compare it with more typical action flicks, it's superior to many, a good but not great movie that is energetic fun most of the time with some terrific moments here and there. Yes, it would have been better directed by James Cameron rather than some director so obscure that I don't know how he finagled the job, but it's still effectively directed.

43,Robert_duder,"In its own right, its a ton of fun",8,18 April 2015,"Terminator 3 is a total departure from the first two films. It perfectly fits the storyline and doesn't create too many glaring plot holes from the first two films. The problem is that there is a distinctive lack of brilliant artistic vision behind it. This was made to cash in and is made to be a mainstream action/sci-fi flick. Taken at that value...I love it. Its fun and campy and absolutely non-stop action packed popcorn popping fun. If you love Schwarzenegger like I do...this is bread and butter for fans of his. He comes back swinging as his infamous Terminator role. Much like Terminator 2 there is a lot of campy scenes and they feel just a little more campy this time around but for some reason campy works in the context of this very real world they create. I think the cleverness behind Terminator 3 is that the action is so good and the pace is so fast that you forget its not as clever as the previous two films. This is all about Arnold and continuing the story and sort of a much expected prologue to Judgement Day. I think it would have been a very different film had James Cameron returned to direct but it is what it is and I enjoy it!! Arnold Schwarzenegger returns as the Terminator. He is more robotic this time and the low brow humour is toned down but it is lots of Arnold. If you look up the easter eggs in place for fans you'll enjoy it quite a bit. It isn't his most charismatic role and definitely not his best turn as the Terminator (I hope that is still to come with Genisys) but it is still great. While I'm not fond of them having a different John Connor every single time...Nick Stahl actually is really great in the role. He is very serious and brooding and plays the part well. His John Connor is a drifter, trying to find his way in the non-Judgement Day world and you actually believe he could become the Saviour of mankind. He doesn't have NEAR the chemistry with Schwarzenegger that Edward Furlong did but he still plays a good part and leads the cast well. Claire Danes is an interesting character and she plays the part well. She does have good chemistry with Stahl and Schwarzenegger and I actually wish she would come back to the series at some point playing Katherine Brewster. Kristanna Loken is interesting in her role. I always thought this would be her breakout role but she sort of slipped into B-Movie obscurity. She is actually extremely effective as the villainous and deadly T-X. She is stunningly beautiful but there is something campy about her performance too. Still she has few lines and her hand to hand battles with Schwarzenegger are excellent. They make worthy foes and while she isn't near as effective as Robert Patrick was but it works. While they manage to write out Sarah Connor, her spirit is alive and well in the story.If you hold Terminator 3 up against T2 then you will hate...plain and simple. Terminator 2 is easily one of the best sci-fi/action films ever made period and this is a far cry from that. But...its far enough after that film that if you watch it for sheer fun then you can find plenty to enjoy. I'm not sure why they put Jonathan Mostow at the helm of such a potentially big entry in the franchise. He just doesn't have the proper experience. He does alright but when you consider one of the best directors of all time practically created this franchise, you can't hand it off to just anyone. The special effects are a HUGE step down and the CGI is nowhere near the standard T2 set (which is funny considering it was a dozen years later.) I'm trying very hard to hold Terminator 3 on its own and not compare it because I love this movie!! Just have fun with it and enjoy the continuing story because it works and it has a ton of action and its not nearly the mess so called ""die hard"" fans make it out to be. Its a step down but still fun. 8/10",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
44,Pjtaylor-96-138044,He's back again.,7,11 July 2019,"Essentially, 'Terminator 3: Rise Of The Machines (2003)' combines the philosophies of the first two movies, positing that the future isn't set but that certain events are, perhaps, inevitable. In this way, it presents a natural and rather interesting extension to the previously established narrative. It's actually a solid story filled with nice character moments and generally intriguing ideas. It also makes a few bold choices which end up being vital to its success. Obviously, it's not as tight as the first or as exciting as the second, and it's not as well-written as either, but it's a competent, surprisingly effective tale nevertheless. Generally, it is a little silly, though. Usually, this isn't too much of an issue; the action scenes are as energetic and engaging as ever, if more outlandish and occasionally downright goofy, and the tone isn't as unbalanced as you might think. Sometimes, however, you do get the sense that things are a little too over-the-top - especially in comparison to its consistently grounded predecessors. There are a few, sporadic moments of comedy that don't quite work. Likewise, some of the 'serious' stuff is a little too serious to be taken seriously (I'm looking at you, opening narration). I think the pacing helps you overlook a lot of these issues, as the thing really does move. As I said before, it's entertaining, too. To say he didn't want to be here, Schwarzenegger is doing a decent job. The character is written as if he has his learning capabilities already unlocked (see the director's cut of 'Terminator 2: Judgement Day (1991)') but that's not too much of a leap. His counterpart is presented as a machine designed to kill machines and does, indeed, feel like she outmatches him. The design of some of her elements seems a little strange - as does the overall 'rigid endoskeleton/ liquid-metal skin' combo - but she's menacing enough. It helps that the chase is pretty much constant this time, essentially being the driving force behind even the more 'grand-scheme' plot. Some of the effects-work leans too far into early-2000s CG to be believable but there's just enough practicality, especially in the car-chase scene, to make up for that. Generally, the flick is much more enjoyable than you might think. It rounds off the narrative of the 'trilogy' rather well, even including some decent overarching character development, and feels fairly complete. Of course, it isn't as good as either of the films it follows. However, it's undeniably entertaining, despite being silly, and that counts for quite a bit. 7/10",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
45,bowmanblue,No matter what you say... it's still better than Part IV,8,26 June 2016,"One of the main problems with 'Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines' was that it had to follow not only the original 'Terminator' movie, but its (arguably better) sequel, 'T2: judgement Day,' therefore whatever came next had not just one, but TWO tough acts to follow. In short – it didn't.It does its best to follow the plot of the first two movies, i.e. bad cyborg sent back through time by the machine-rulers of the future to kill humanity's last hope for survival versus protector (also from the future), however, it comes across as a Terminator-made-for-TV movie. If it wasn't for the fact that Arnold Schwarzenegger stars as the titular cyborg, it has a real sense of being a lot less epic than its predecessors.For a start, it's shorter, secondly, the effects don't seem to have improved much since the groundbreaking 'liquid metal' SFX from T2 and it never really makes us care much about the characters. Linda Hamilton did not want to reprise her role as the iconic action heroine Sarah Connor, leaving Claire Danes to do her best to fill her shoes. And, if you've been following Edward Furlong's 'career' since he made his name as the young John Connor from T2, you'll know that he wasn't in much shape to reprise his role. Instead, Nick Stahl tries his best to play humanity's future leader and, although credit for making him look like his (on screen) father, Kyle Reece, is never really given much to do apart from look confused at the fact that the Terminator has returned. In other words... T1/2 produced real characters who stuck with us through the ages whereas T3 rushes us from one chase scene to the next and it's over before you know it.Don't get me wrong – I didn't hate Part III. I own it and watch it every few years (just not as much as the first two, obviously!). It has its good parts – mainly Schwarzenegger. He still holds his own, even playing – technically – a new cyborg from the last two instalments. It's also worth noting that Part 3 is a '12' certificate, therefore don't expect the overall dark tone from the other two. There are more wisecracks here which lighten the mood.But, even if you do hate it, it's still pretty good fun watching two indestructible cyborgs go toe to toe and the ending is actually quite good. Perhaps the worst thing about it was that it's great ending leads us effortlessly into Part IV (aka Salvation) and we all know how that one turned out (sorry Christian Bale, but a Terminator is not a Terminator movie without Mr Schwarzenegger taking the lead role).",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
46,dromasca,Best Action Movie of the Summer,8,10 August 2003,"This is a summer action film, and if you approach it this way you will enjoy it. I liked it more than the other blockbusters of this summer. For a change there is a coherent story here, with the logic of a Terminator story, but still logic. The film is not too long, it does not have any philosophical pretentions, and you get what you paid for. Action is very well done, effects are first class, though there is no great innovation as in the previous films of the series who were classics of special effects. Acting is decent - playing robots makes the profession easier for Schwarzenegger and his female partner who do not belong to the Nicholson league. The only mis-cast is Claire Daines whose make-up and wardrobe make her look ten years older than her Connors boyfriend and future husband.

49,CuriosityKilledShawn,Judgment Day. The End of the World. It's today. Three hours from now!,8,5 January 2007,"I'm probably going to lose instant credibility by saying this, but I think that T3 is the best in the series. Yes, T2 and the original are brilliant but T3 is simply all action from start to finish. It's a breathless, relentless thrill-ride that doesn't let up until the shocking, refreshingly downbeat climax.Nick Stahl easily steps into the role of John Connor, vacated by Eddie Furlong and surpasses him in terms of acting and character development. T3 takes place over a couple of days but the actors still get enough out of the sudden, fast-paced plot developments to prevent them from simply being furniture. I was surprised at how emotional and engaging Nick Stahl's performance was as I had previously thought he was totally inappropriate for the part.T3 has Connor as some sort of Ronin type character, living separate from the rest of humanity, paranoid that Skynet may be able to track his footsteps in the future and send a Terminator to kill him. He knows he destroyed Cyberdyne and everything SHOULD be okay, but something else just stops him from keeping in touch with the world. Plus Sarah Connor is dead, leaving a John alone in an unstable time.Computer networks are failing across the planet and there seems to be a giant ghost in the machine. Everyone seems oblivious to the brewing trouble until the T-X and the T-800 step out of the time displacement field, hellbent on blowing each other and the city to smithereens.Amazing special effects, stunt work and CGI make up the rest of the movie, which is essentially one huge chase. I found it to be pretty seamless when I first saw it but upon repeat viewings you can tell what's fake and what's not. But only if you look really hard. T3 uses its effects to make a good movie, not just a pretentious trailer. Something that so many shallow effects movies do.Of course there are problems. As always in a film with such a white-knuckle momentum, plot coherence is sacrificed for timing. Why is Kate Brewster and her boyfriend shopping in the middle of the night? How on earth would Connor's Leutenant's have survived Judgment Day when they clearly live in the middle of LA and would have been fried to a crisp? There are also some continuity problems with the first 2 movies not the least of which are the wildly incorrect character ages. But even James Cameron himself didn't define this too clearly in T2. And why is Arnie's Terminator model now called a T-101? He's a T-800: Cyberdyne Systems Model 101. A couple of quick exposition scenes could have made all this nice and neat. But they couldn't be bothered I guess. This is probably why so many fans of Cameron's entries turned their noses up that T3.I find it unlikely that there will ever be a Terminator 4. Arnie is too busy to commit himself to a time-consuming project like that and it just wouldn't be a Terminator movie without him.

51,Bored_Dragon,They should have left it at two,6,23 May 2018,"The third film in the ""Terminator"" franchise deteriorates to the level of cheap action SF. (When I say cheap I'm not referring to budget, of course.) It does not bring anything new either in the story nor visually, but copies the previous film with essentially insignificant variations. Action scenes are greatly done, but since the film is virtually reduced to an endless series of explosions, it soon becomes tedious. Nick Stahl, in my opinion, is not an adequate substitute for Edward Furlong, Clare Danes is made for romantic movies and she was thorn in my eye through the whole thing, absence of Linda Hamilton feels too much, and the Schwarzenegger performance is weaker than in previous movies, although this is more to the script than to him. Practically the only thing worth watching in this movie is the beautiful Kristanna Loken in the role of the latest Terminator model. It's not boring, but if you skip it, you won't miss much.6/10",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
52,tabuno,Bubble Gum Movie,8,29 August 2019,"What makes for a great film? Terminator 3: The Rise of the Machines (T3) presents a good example for discussion. Take a relatively decent plot with a subtle twist at the end, base the movie on an old but classic (meaning a 30 year old sci fi concept - see ""Colossus: The Forbin Project"") and though in some dramatic elements and special effect chase and hunt scenes and you have an American film formula that is hard to beat, at least in America. T3 represents all that is American. The good American individual hero versus the bad, evil enemy (in this case Machines), at plenty of action, a female counterpart (in both good and evil roles), use some emotional scenes for depth, a bit of humor, use a simple and straightforward plot for the America mental attention span and you have a good entertaining movie production that also makes people feel both good and bad at the same time. Like Jaws, this particular American formula its American consumption diets like candy. And with as guilty of pleasure as may be described, T3 seems to work well in its almost seamless, consistently riveting scenes. With only a number of doubtless unrealistic scenes (pauses for dramatic effect where the characters are really supposed to continue running for their very lives and the unbelievable law enforcement chase scenes and rather extraordinary demolition of property visuals), T3 seems to pull off enough of the summer bubblegum fantasy theme as to make everything acceptable. Eight stars out of ten for decent, if not really original, action and drama.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
53,The-Sarkologist,Number 2 all over again,6,12 June 2017,"There was a period of time between when I was at university and when I started writing reviews for films again that I had become somewhat distracted. In fact there was a period of time when I didn't see all that many films at all, with the exception of some really big name ones that I absolutely had to see – Terminator 3 was one of them. I guess the reason was because ever since Terminator 2 I wanted to see a version set in the future where they are fighting the robots, and a part of me was expecting the third installment to be that movie. Unfortunately, as it turned out, this wasn't to be the case. In fact it seems, in many aspects, simply a remake of the second film – pretty much more of the same.This time we are ten years in the future and John Conner is now in his early twenties. He is a drifter, his mother is dead, and it seems as if the world has been freed from Skynet. Well, the problem is that John still seems to be having these nightmares, so he is wandering whether he can actually relax. It is clear that he can't because he is simply drifting, off the grid, simply trying to survive while hoping that the world doesn't blow itself up. Unfortunately that isn't going to be the case because two more terminators come back from the future, one to protect him and one to not only attempt to kill him, but to also kill his lieutenants.As I suggested, this film is basically just a rehash of the plot of the second film, which boils down to the simple line of two robots slugging it out. Sure, we have Arnie returning to reprise his role as the T800 (actually it is the T850 now, which is somewhat better than the previous two), but we also have another terminator come back, this one being a more advanced version that can now create energy weapons as opposed to simply knives and stabbing weapons. Mind you, it felt a little contrived since it seemed that the T-1000, that was pure living metal, was somewhat more advanced than this new one that happened to have an endo-skeleton.I have since discovered that the second movie was supposed to be the end of the franchise, but obviously the demand for sequels was just that little too high, which is why we have had it resurrected in this third, forth, and fifth movie. However, the idea behind the film, in that while Cyberdyne was destroyed, the idea of Skynet wasn't, does hold a lot of water. For instance, the suggestion is that Miles wasn't the only person that worked at home. The other thing is that the movement of technology was inevitable. All we need to do is look about us today to see how the movement towards AI is progressing, and more so, despite the warnings that are given to us in not only movies like Terminator, but also Isaac Asimov, we seem to be blindly charging into the future once again. Who knows, one day we may wake up under the rule of our robot overlords.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

55,slightlymad22,Schwarzenegger And The Franchise Deserve Better Than This,6,25 July 2016,"Continuing my plan to watch every movie in Arnold Schwarzenegger's filmography in order, I come to Terminator 3: Rise Of The Machines. Plot In A Paragraph: John Connor is living off the grid, but a new advanced Terminator, is sent back to change the past once more. Luckily the humans had also sent a bodyguard back again too. Where to start...... In basically a retread of T2, there were scenes of violence and action, with some dreary talk in between. Everything was just so Bland and uninteresting. The Terminator franchise was officially becoming a bore. First of all, the writers of the movie didn't even like Terminator movies and admittedly took the job just for the money. In his own blog, John Brancato says he and Ferris took the job because Ferris wanted a new house. Why Jonathan Mostow (another with no respect for the source material or the franchise) was given the job of directing is anybody's guess, but Arnie had approval, in his mega 33 page contract written by a super Hollywood lawyer. Arnie's Terminator is a joke right from his first scene, it's almost a parody!! A total disgrace. John Connor is an incompetent fool, and the way the T-X goes around taking down her victims is ludicrous. Take the drive thru guy for example. She not only knew he was working that night, but also that he was serving at the drive thru?? PLEASE!! Considering she can change her appearance, she only does so once. Also considering this is time travel, why didn't Skynet, give her more than a few hours to try and kill 22 targets?? Even if they were all in L.A. The full thing is just full of holes!! The lack of respect for the franchise is apparent, and if the writers and director didn't care, why should the audience?? The ending saved it a little bit, but not enough to redeem everything that came before it.Arnie, wooden as an old oak beam, looks as if he were desperately wishing he was somewhere else. His performance here is miles away from the first two, and for the first time, I'm going to say he phones it in. 12 years ago, thanks to T2, he was the world's No 1 action Star. He not only laughed all the way to the bank... He bought it. But what of Schwarzenegger now. Nothing had come up trumps since Eraser 7 years ago..... There is nothing he can do, and he does very little. Throughout the whole affair he looks old, tired and bored. Audiences still lapped up Terminator 3, to the tune of a $150 million domestic gross, making it the 8th highest grossing movie of the year. I'm torn between a 5 or 6/10 on this one. It's certainly better than his last three movies, but it's an awful Terminator movie.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
56,paulclaassen,Incredible action.,6,11 June 2018,"Impressive visuals! The actions scenes are really incredible and all-out spectacular. The (sometimes silly) humor was actually quite funny, too, especially with Arnold's very dry sense of humor that comes across so hilarious. Just like the previous films, this is non-stop action and excitement from beginning to end. Loken was fantastic as the antagonist. Yes, the film does feature the 'destroy-as-much-as-possible' action sequences Hollywood action films are known for, but it does actually work well in these films.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

58,Movie Nuttball,The sequel has finally come! Theatrecal & video comments below!,10,6 July 2003,"I saw Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines on the 4th of July 2003 and on the same night I saw The Hulk!It was an excellent experience seeing both blockbusters right after the other!It was well worth it and a unique way to spend on Independence Day!As a very big fan of the Terminator series this was a must see!The first one was dark movie and the second film was extraordinary and epic.The third one believe it or not I really can't say.Maybe it because I haven't seen this one a few dozen times like T2 but the movie just didn't seem or feel as epic.It didn't have that specialness the Judgment Day had that it was so perfect that you could cry feel.Sure it was an extremely entertaining movie as the action scenes in the new film were spectacular and some of biggest and greatest action scenes to date.The movie had some humor in it and other scenes were similar like the other two.As for the characters.Since Arnold's T-850 is different that the other Terminator he acted as if he really was different.His looks stayed about the same but with different guns and even a some what different attitude.The new villain the T-X or Terminatrix played by Kristanna Loken was a phenomenal character!She was the perfect choice to play the bad Terminator and she is much,much more power than the T-850.I don't want spoil what she can do but she can do just about anything!I really like the actress who plays her.She is a very neat looking young woman and I would love to see here in more action films.As for Claire Danes she played her part very well and yes I like her looks too just in case your curious.Nick Stahl was good and the way he played a older John Connor made it seem real.Earl Boen returns as Dr. Peter Silberman for a very brief moment and his role in this film was surprising.Unlike the beginning of T2 this beginning with the Endoskeletons looked all CGI but yet it looked great!Brad Fiedel is gone form the movie but Marco Beltrami's score is just as decent and even though the beautiful Terminator theme is gone until the end credits Beltrami has his own score! James Cameron is out and Jonathan Mostow is in.Mostow actually pulled it off!His direction was very good and I think the project was directed right.How Cameron would have directed and handled this new Terminator movie is unknown.I do hope there will be a sequel with the same cast.I think what I said above about it not being special is because I only saw it once.Overall it had plenty of fights between the Terminators and in the action scenes there was so much damage with chase scenes and it was never boring that I think it should satisfy most Terminator fans and even if your not a Terminator fan but love Arnold and action movies I think you should give this a look! I strongly recommend it!I bought the movie Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines and in My opinion its is just as good and action packed as the other two. This one has a whole bunch of incredible action! Arnold was great! Nick Stahl and Claire Danes were good! I really liked Danes! Kristanna Loken was awesome as the T-X Terminatrix! She was the perfect choice to play this great villain! I hope to see this awesome looking woman in more action films in the near future! David Andrews and Earl Boen were good. The music by Marco Beltrami is excellent an is arguably the greatest score ever composed in My opinion! If you like Arnold and the other Terminator films and have not seen this movie then don't rent but buy this immediately because I strongly recommend it!Movie Nuttball's NOTE:Watch the the end credits for the original Terminator theme performed by Marco Beltrami! Also plays the cool song called ""The Current"" performed by The Blue Man Group featuring Gavin Rossdale! Its an excellent song!",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
59,Thanos_Alfie,Expected more...,6,18 June 2020,"""Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines"" is an Action - Sci-Fi movie in which we watch a cyborg trying to protect a man and a woman from a more advanced cyborg.Since I had already watched the two previous movies I have to admit that I expected more from it. Despite the simple but interesting plot, some good interpretations and the good direction which was made by Jonathan Mostow, ""Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines"" is a good action movie and nothing more. It cannot be compared with the two previous movies of Terminator because it did not reach neither the potential of the movie nor the expectations of most of the fans.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
60,zkonedog,Lacks The Gravitas Of The Previous Films,4,3 March 2017,"There are many problems with ""Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines"". Despite those problems, however, it manages to remain an okay flick. It's just disappointing, considering it could have been oh so much more.For a basic plot summary, ""T3"" sees a future in which Judgment Day has not yet happened because of the successful events of T2. John Connor (Nick Stahl) is a vagrant, moving from place to place in search of relief for his nightmares about a potential apocalypse. In 2004, a female Terminator (Kristanna Loken) comes hunting for John and a number of people who become his future associates. So does Judgment Day still happen? That will be up to John, Kate Brewster (Claire Danes), and the classic Terminator model (Arnold Schwarzenegger) to figure out.The good thing I have to say about this film is that it uses the Skynet plot line that probably should have been used in T2 (I never liked the Cyberdyne angle of that film). For the first time in this series, viewers get to see what Skynet would have been like in its initial stages, and that was pretty cool.The big and obviously problem, however, is that ""T3"" lacks the gravitas that the other films before it so easily possessed. This was probably due to James Cameron removing himself from the director's chair. This feels too much like a ""tacked on"" film that was kind of making things up as it went along. They stumbled upon an interesting Skynet plot, but other than that it is kind of a mess. Too many explosions and gun battles, as that isn't what this series is really about.Truth be told, I can only give this movie three stars because I like the sci-fi and time-travel aspects of the franchise. Basically, I want it to be better than it really is. It is more of a 2.5 or maybe even 2-star effort. Sad, as such a better story could have been told.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
61,Floated2,Doesn't work well,3,26 January 2021,"The original first two films in the Terminator franchise put high pressure upon this third film as far as potential.

It is quite dull, the story is repetitive and not all that interesting and the characters of John Connor and Kate are annoying and irritating. Besides a few solid action sequences, Rise of the machines is relatively boring.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
62,johnnyboyz,"Healthy and well executed continuation of the series, not submitting to genre convention while exploring its leads in an impressive manner.",6,17 May 2009,"Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines seems to hold up for me, on subsequent viewings. I took to it the first time I saw it, and have since been quite surprised by the level of antagonism most people have toward it. The film is far from the disaster it could have been; it draws on inspiration from the previous two films and rather than aim to go bigger and better, it actually opts to go underneath them – this, it most certainly achieves. Drawing on the fast moving element of chase and the very bleak atmosphere the first film had, Terminator 3 delivers as a downbeat and briskly paced thriller with a science-fiction twist. It additionally works as a polished action film, something the second Terminator film was, with numerous action set pieces but with additional substance in the form of studies of individuals and their hardened bodies. Unlike the second film, however, which offered hope at the end of the narrative; Terminator 3 sticks to its guns and concludes on a downbeat tone, echoing the first film and setting up what will be a supposed number of sequels.I think a lot of people dislike the film because they're told to dislike the film; almost as if people are frightened of reading too much into the text. Yes, Cameron had no input to its production; yes, the enemy Terminator is a female; yes, Schwarzenegger's 'good' Terminator is a lot less sympathetic and there's a smaller focus on man and machine co-existing, but so what? The film remains an interesting character piece, establishing would-be hard bodied heroes and fleshing them out. On the other strand, it tells the tale of a certain military individual by name of Lieutenant General Robert Brewster (Andrews) and his final developments, along with the United States Air Force, of a complicated new weapons system they inherited from Cyberdyne Systems following their destruction in the second film. Brewster jokingly, but ominously, talks about how he wants to keep humans and their decisions 'in the loop' when it comes to co-existing with machines.The film begins with a now adult John Connor (Stahl), a nobody, an everyday guy whom does some work here and there; drifts on his motorcycle; rues the death of his mother Sarah and sits atop high bridges late at night with a beer, quite possibly contemplating suicide. The first glimpses of this individual goes against the more typical image of an action genre lead: John is weak and a relative nobody, whilst possesses very few skills. He will once again get put through the survival grinder as Arnold Schwarzenegger, in his third innings as his career defining role, is sent back to 2003 to protect him from a more advanced enemy robot named the T-X (Loken), a female super-assassin who is five times the antagonist the T-1000 was in terms of both power and ability. Like Robert Patrick's role, and to a degree Schwarzenegger's in the first film, the film opts for a relative unknown in Kristanna Loken who pulls off her role with the same anonymity and menace as her predecessors.Going through the grinder with John and the T-850 Terminator is Kate Brewster (Danes), the daughter of the aforementioned Robert of high military importance. Kate is the film's secondary study of a would-be hard bodied character; she successfully goes from squealing, screaming veterinarian to miniature Hunter Killer destroyer-come-soldier in what is a moment of realisation by both characters that she is of that material – those that groan in disappointment at this occurrence are those that have completely missed the study in transition, thus going back to what I say about people being afraid to read too much into it. Much earlier on, she additionally displays a hardened attitude when she outsmarts John, mistaking him for a junkie breaking into the veterinarian hospital, and locks him in an animal cage. Kate advances, emotionally, as she looses those she loves and becomes more weary of the situation.The T-X acts as an interesting element to the film. The filmmakers have not updated the 'role' of the antagonistic robot purely to be different and offer variation in the role. Rather, they have allowed the most powerful character in the entire film to be a woman, something that is relatively unheard of in today's action genre. Equally refreshing is the refraining from turning both the T-X and Kate into objects of desire, forever developing and fleshing out one as the other ponders a woman's role in the new world she been transported back to when she observes a bra advertisement board asking us 'What is Sexy?' For those out for the set pieces, the film includes a few scenes of great action: the initial coming together of the robotic forces and the ensuing escape/acquiring of Kate and John as well as a shootout and consequent escape at a cemetery, during which Earl Boen gets an amusing cameo. The Terminator and the TX have an additional hand-to-hand fight in a public bathroom. The film is, essentially, a tragedy rather than a glorification of violence or a fetishisation of explosions. It documents mankind's inability to come to terms with the weapons they have at their disposal and modernity in general. I find Terminator 3 to be interesting in its own right, and worthy of a place on the mantle amongst the first two, but to echo Sarah Connor's words as she journeys to destroy the Cyberdyne building in Terminator 2: furthering the franchise into the future is 'a venture into the unknown, a making up of history as we go along'. It may yet prove to be futile and a bit of a miss-judgement and that, like judgement day, money-making sequels to established franchises ""are inevitable"".",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
63,filipemanuelneto,"It delivers what it promises, but that's it.",6,14 March 2021,"After two excellent films, Hollywood made the mistake of reviving the ""Terminator"" franchise and ruining it completely. But in this film we are still at an acceptable level of quality where things still seem to make some sense. In this film, we follow John Connor in another race to save himself from a TX machine, sent from the future, in the form of a woman, but with the mission of killing him and all the future human militia commanders. It is more of the same if we think about it and if we want to compare this film with its predecessors. But with less quality.Overall, I liked the film, it honors its predecessors, but it is not able to do better, nor to do it differently. As has already happened, the film is essentially based on chases with immense destruction and shootings with increasingly powerful weaponry. There are several attempts to create comedic moments, but they don't always work and the dialogues are spiritless and sometimes irritating. And now that I mention it, one thing that caught my attention, and I don't know if it was just me, was the forced way in which the famous catchphrase ""I'll be back"" was used. And I don't even talk about monologues... I think some of them were perfectly expendable.Again, as in other times, it is Arnold Schwarzenegger's performance that saves the film. As if he were a colossus, he is the one who carries it on his back. And in fact he is a great actor and is totally at ease in the role, which he already knows and immortalized. Nick Stahl is average and does reasonably in the role of Connor, but it did not convince me much. Better than him, Claire Danes is very good for the role she received and is the only actress who can keep up with Schwarzenegger in his work. Kristanna Loken is also quite good.Technically, it is a very good film, but I still prefer ""Terminator 2"", even though I know that the special effects used do not have the refinement of this film. I think the effects used in the film do their job well, but they can't be as surprising as those used in the older film. The action scenes, of course, are the strongest part of the film, and fill the measures with those who appreciate the genre, with immense destruction, explosions and twisted iron. Cinematography is very good, and makes good use of urban landscapes, the desert and scenes without light or in low light. Good editing and editing also help, and sets and costumes fulfill their role. The soundtrack makes good use of the leitmotiv of the franchise, but it does not stand out particularly.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
64,digitalbeachbum,Time travel failure,1,21 July 2021,"I have a new policy for reviewing movies. No matter how much fun they are, if the premise/plot/script is seriously flawed then the movie doesn't work for me. It automatically receives a 1/10 rating.Time travel is a killer for all writers. If they don't understand the logic behind it then the movie fails because it isn't plausible. With that in mind, The Terminator could never plausibly happen therefore it should have only been a cartoon or at best an animated flick.Time travel with James Cameron is that The Terminator goes back in time to kill Sarah Connor, which it fails. The machines in the future would have known they failed, instantly.A thought experiment, using James Cameron's logic.If the machines calculated that killing Sarah Connor was needed so she wouldn't have a baby, why send another Terminator back to kill John Connor? They failed the first time, so why not send one back 30-40 years earlier, when she was a child? Why send one ten years later in time? Why stop there? Why not send one back to the 50 BC? Why not send twenty Terminators back to 100 BC? Technically they could have brought back with them the main processor, with the intelligent leader/program. They could have built everything from the ground up, destroy all humans and conquer humanity while humans have spears and swords.And to go further, why conquer humanity? The AI doesn't work that way, it wasn't programmed to have an EGO, so even if the AI became sentient why would a computer program have an EGO? Desires would have to be part of the programming. Desires would have to be originally programmed to be part of the program. If you claim ""I'm alive"" it means nothing in relation to your desires or feelings.Look, it's a fun movie. If you like it, then cool, enjoy the Sci-Fi of it. It's Arnold after all and doing the ""body count"" for the movie is always a fun aspect. Arguing over who could have lived and who must have died in the police station is definitely a funny discussion to have while watching the movie.With that being said, I give James Cameron 1/10 for this movie.

65,insomniac_rod,Less complex but more entertaining.,8,3 January 2010,"""Rise of the Machines"" delivered exactly what I expected.It's almost impossible to top the masterpiece that ""Judgment Day"" represents. The 1991 film has one of the most complex, intelligent, and interesting plots of all time.""Terminator III"" is half popcorn fun and half tries to continue with the Terminator legacy.There's plenty of extremely good action (all about the vehicles chase and the cemetery confrontation), nice humor (Arnie hasn't lost it!), good acting, and it gives a continuation to the Terminator saga. Die hard fans should be pleased and not try to compare it to part 1 and 2.Sure, it's less complex and sacrifices the complex plot for entertainment, but still it's filled of interesting sequences that will remind you it's a Terminator movie.Arnold is fine on his role. He still knows that it takes to be the Terminator. I didn't buy Nick Stahl's performance. I mean, I don't think John Connor should be represented as an anxious young man who barely demonstrates character. Come on! He's the leader of the resistance! Claire Danes is extremely beautiful and I liked the way her character's life changed all of a sudden in such a bizarre manner. Kristanna Lokken was creepy, effective, sexy as the Terminatrix. Excellent idea! The Direction is great. Pure candy for the eye with dynamic camera angles and a stylish look on it. It captures perfectly the whole machines rebellion.The f/x are spectacular, impressive at some points. Oh money can buy happiness in cinema! The art direction and cinematography is really good but at some points it doesn't feels like a Terminator movie.Still it's a very good addition to the series.

As far as that goes, it's a success. Considering how many of the basic ideas here were plumbed by the first film, there's also a surprising amount to think about here.  Fundamental problems exist, however: for one thing, there is so much carnage and destruction in the first 40 minutes of the movie that nothing which follows after can top it.  Loken is not particularly memorable in the way the 2 previous Terminators were, but Stahl and Daines are fine as the new Connors/lover combo.

68,Vartiainen,"Doesn't match it predecessors, but a good action film nonetheless",9,28 December 2013,"The first Terminator film is a classic example of an intense action/horror scifi film done just right. Everything is perfect from the bleak setting to the depressing storyline about a future where the machines have taken over and their only salvation is to try and mess with time itself. The second film, also directed by James Cameron, was more of a straight-up action film, but just as great as the original, if not even a bit better. And then there's the third one.It's not as good as the first two. The lack of James Cameron shows in the lack of vision. It's not as ambitious as the first two, the actors aren't as talented - Schwarzenegger though once again shines in his trademark role, though nothing new about him is uncovered - and the story tries to patch some of the plot holes of the previous movies, but only manages to create new ones in their stead. Even the character of John Connor, played by Nick Stahl, the centerpiece and lynchpin of the entire saga, suffers from being reduced to a whiny little jerk. I much preferred the determined kid of the second movie to this fatalist loser.That being said, this is still a really good action film. One of the best I've seen in the new century and well worth the price of admission. The movie suffers from the common sequel syndrome of trying to do everything bigger and better, even if it usually ends up jumping the shark, so to speak. However, in this case we get Arnold ""Real-Life Hulk"" Schwarzenegger in his last honest action superstar role, really flashy fight sequences, cool chase scenes and lots of dakka. The hotblooded male in me refuses to regard this as a bad thing. And quite honestly the ending manages to reach some of that bleakness that coloured the first two films and made them so jarringly touching. It's not quite there, but you get hints.I rated this movie quite high because I honestly think that it's a great action film. If you're looking for a worthy successor to Cameron's Terminator films, this isn't it, not really. It's still quite an enjoyable ride if you're just looking for a thrilling action piece.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

I do NOT own T3.Nuff said? No?It is the epitome of puerile. It is under-dramatized, the script is nothing more than cliché after cliché and the focus of the actor seems to be somewhere in the distance, rather than on the situations to which they are supposed to be subjected.The ""Terminatrix"" was a cool idea, and she pulled it off with a bit of panache and talent. But the effects and function of the T-1000 (Played excellently by Robert Patrick in T2-Judgment Day), were far superior, as was the story line and the direction of the cast.It's amazing to me to sit in a theater after shelling out a load of money to see a star-studded cast walking around seemingly without any sense of purpose or direction.It was a sorry, slip-shod excuse for a sequel to the first two movies, which were excellently done and extremely well made, well written and directed by a Master; James Cameron.On the lighter side; however, the rumor going around the web concerning Mr. Schwarzenegger's having paid out of his own pocket to film the crane scene is a nice thought. I wonder if it's true? Does anyone know?And, I am looking forward with (only a small degree now of...) hope for the future run of War of the Machines movies which are now made possible by the storyline.I can only hope someone comes to their senses and brings back James Cameron to do them. And maybe they won't start the War of the Machines without Schwarzenegger.Let's all hope. Shall we?It rates a 3.2/10 from...the Fiend :.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
71,elshikh4,Talk To The Hand !,6,20 February 2009,"Remember guys, not everything is as it seems.The atmosphere is fine for pure action; I didn't see anything serious or catchy as a sci-fi. The worst of it was the easy repetition of the Terminator's plot: a hunted human with super assistant, a super hunter, and a hunt through the city. It's nearly the second one again, however with a lady cyborg this time. Which's cool and modern. But made it so predictable, and transformed the whole matter into slasher movie with big explosions!The whole unseen-story about the end of the world has gone too far, too complicated, and too exploited! Originally the matter of the doomsday in 1999 as false happening is truly laughable, and such a disgrace to the first 2 movies. The climax wasn't up to what preceded it. The CGI was good, but for sure not a milestone like the sequel of 1992. Director (Jonathan Mostow) makes good ""noisiness"" along the way, with nothing more to offer.Despite looking a bit weary and old, (Arnold Schwarzenegger) hands in nice performance, but as just a funny take on his persona from the previous 2 movies. (Nick Stahl) is annoying as John Connor (could it mean that the future leaders would be boring?!). (Claire Danes) is great, but with no great thing to do. And I HATED the nudity; it's the way how Hollywood movies are sold since 1968, and I just HATE that!I liked the way (Arnie)'s trade mark ""I'll Be Back"" had been handled without hackneying (""I'm back"", ""she'll be back"",.. smart!), still the Terminator's gags are the most enjoyable moments in here.I recall well that at the time of its release, it was one of the most smuggled movies ever; managing to be a rented videotape, near my house, while it was in cinemas, or even before that! Also, its IMDb first rating was something like 9,8!! That what made me learn about the IMDb's ratings as not always the golden truth, hence nothing is as it seems. Btw, after 6 years, it's now 6,7.. Would fairness win eventually?All in all, it's fair action, with funny moments, but don't wait for more even in terms of imagination.

72,generationofswine,An Honest Review,1,6 August 2019,"Well... I kind of feel like giving this 10 stars based on Salvation and, especially, Genisys. I mean, in retrospect, compared to those two, it actually feels like you are watching a really good movie doesn't it?It has a plot that actually makes sense, and, unlike Genisys, it fits into the greater Terminator story without changing everything just to, well, just to change the entire canon and story for the sake of... what? I honestly don't know.However, when you compare it to Terminator and T2, it actually seems like you are watching a horrible movie. Nick Stahl was possibly the worst person to play John Conner they could have cast, Sarah Coner is gone (and with her the protagonist everyone loved) and Claire Danes just doesn't seem to know what she's doing in the film.Not only that, but Stahl comes across as the worst possible leader on earth... and he's the one that is supposed to be the legend that finally beats the machines? Seriously? Him?It might have been better if the Terminatrix was in it for more than a blink of the eye, but she kind of takes a back seat to everything else that is going on and leaves us wondering why they even added her into the movie.Ultimately, it's not a good film. However, compared to Salvation and the typo, it comes across as a masterpiece.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
73,freemantle_uk,'Talk to the Hand',3,8 June 2009,"And with that quotation is a perfect example with everything that is wrong with Terminator 3 and how is doesn't keep in spirit with the James Cameron masterpieces.Set in 2004, John Connor (Nick Stahl) is an out-the-grid drifter. Computer systems around America are starting to fail, and this is a puzzle to Air Force General Robert Brewster (David Andrews), the commander of the new Skynet system. In 2032, the machines had lost the war and sent an advance terminator, the TX (Kristanna Loken). Her mission is to kill John Connor's lieutenants, including Kate Brewster (Claire Danes), a vet and John's future wife. The resistance send a re-programmed Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) to protect John and Kate from the TX and the impending doom of Judgement Day. The Terminator tells John and Kate that John and Sarah Connor never stopped Judgement Day, just delayed and that Judgement Day was just a day away. This sets the heroes into a race against time to stop the event.I bet James Cameron wished he used his alternative ending, it would have stopped any sequel being made. The whole point of the ending Terminator 2: Judgement Day was Judgement Day was stopped and that John and Sarah were free to live their lives. What's the point if they is no hope. James Cameron refused to do T3, saying T2 was the end of it. Linda Hamilton refused to do T3 because Cameron wasn't involved, and Schwarzenegger only did this film because he was paid $30 Million and 20% of the profits, I don't blame him really. It also helped his political ambitions.The choice of director was Jonathan Mostow, a workman-like director who made the awful U-571. Also, the screenwriters were John Brancato and Michael Ferris, wrote Catwoman, that says it all.T3 was basically made as a re-harsh and parody of T2. They is too much humour which wasn't needed at all. The whole point of the first two films was that they were played straight as possible. They are poor lines and no good one-liners (such as 'you are terminated!') compared in the first two films,. When the Terminator steals his clothes off a male-strippers, and eyes stealing them off a fat woman, or that the TX makes her breasts bigger to stop the cops these are all very bad signs. The action scenes were well done, but nothing surprise, nor especially memorable.But the worst part of the film is the characterisation. John Connor goes from punk kid who had to battle the T-1000 to a scared young man who is really dumb, especially since he had to live through. Nick Stahl was a terrible choice to play John Connor. Arnold Schwarzenegger ends up over-acting and being overly emotional, which is surprising seeing he is an actor of limited talents. Claire Danes is a pretty good actress, but isn't served well in this film. Kristanna Loken lacked the menace of being a foe to the Terminator and the screenwriters were just pushing the extremes from large bloke (T1), to skinny man (T2), to skinny woman (T3).The screenwriters attempt to hard to make twists in this film. The only things worth seeing are Earl Boen cameo as Dr. Peter Silberman and the ending. Any true Terminator fan should ignore this film and just focus on T1 and T2.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
74,strong-122-478885,"With The Future Already Written, What's The Point?",2,13 February 2015,"Question: Can a sequel get much worse than T3?.... Answer: I think not.Regardless of its whopping $200 million budget, T3 (which, of course, focused on violence, explosions and mass destruction) (Well, what did I expect?) certainly turned out to be some of the absolute stalest storytelling that I've had the displeasure of seeing in a mighty long time.If you ask me - I am utterly sick to death of Arnold's ""Terminator"" shtick. And, this time around, Arnold's performance (that featured some of the lamest one-liners imaginable) was a total embarrassment on all counts.After being paid a ridiculous $30 million to star in this ""Save-The-Future"" clunker, I seriously think that Arnold should be absolutely ashamed of himself for delivering such a crappy portrayal of a T-101 bimbo.With T3's story simply going over the same, old, tired ground, again and again, the viewer would have to be a totally clueless nitwit not to see that this idiotic, action yarn was going nowhere, fast.Anyways - I thought that Nick Stahl made for an utterly pathetic and completely despicable ""Saviour"" as John Connor. And having the super-upgraded TX model be a hot-looking woman was the absolute last straw in Sci-Fi stupidity that broke the terminator's back.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
75,dfranzen70,Somewhere in the middle of YES! and yeah.,7,21 July 2003,"Smack dab in the middle of such lustrous movies as Pirates of the Carribbean, The Hulk, The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, The Matrix: Reloaded, and X2 comes Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines. You know, I remember when Arnold was mighty enough to warrant a Fourth of July opening for his movies, but apparently his studio is happy with the movie's being buried in a sea of zap!bam!pow! action movies.Ah, but enough carping about the timing. Let's get to the nitty gritty, shall we?People fall into three categories. First, there are the ones who have never seen a Terminator film. Those people aren't likely to watch this third installment. Then there are the ones who thought the second one was better than the first. Those people will probably think this one's not as good as the second, but about on par with the first. And then thee are those who thought the first one rocked like a mighty cradle; those people might be disappointed and will probably crow to the rest of us that sequels are always bad and that the original is always better.Here's the story, kids. The scene is a few years after Terminator 2. In that movie, John Connor was 11 years old. Now he's more like 14 or 15. He's on his own, pretty much bumming around the country, doing odd jobs, always on the run, that sort of thing. And somehow he runs into the Terminator along the way.Now, you might remember the Terminator as being Bad in the first movie and Good in the second. When John meets him, he doesn't know which attitude will be taken by the robot. So why is the T-800 (Arnold) back? Well, he said he'd be. But more importantly, he's here to protect John once again. And from whom, you might ask? From a T-X, a female Terminator, sent back in time by the machines in the future to kill John's lieutenants.See, the machines don't know where John is in this present time. They do have a fix on the whereabouts of the people who will become his top deputies when he finally leads the resistance. Their theory, then, is to kill them off, hoping to thwart the rebellion by man before it really develops.Funny thing, though. The homeless John breaks into a veterinary clinic to get some medicine, and it just so happens that working at the clinic is Kate Brewster, who is to be one of his lieutentants. The T-X arrives there to rub Kate out and stumbles upon John, and that's when Arnold shows up.The second Terminator movie had a huge budget, and the money was wisely spent on special effects, effects that were state-of-the-art in 1991. Now, CGI is all the rage, so the effects aren't so special. So to make up for a lack of innovation, the filmmakers (not James Cameron, who made the first two movies) throw in a lot of crashes, explosions and other loudnesses. In fact, there's a long, long car/truck chase scene near the very beginning that's pretty well done - but overlong. And, unfortunately, it occurs before the plot can really be set in place.The movie itself isn't very long - two hours is nothing for an action movie. A little more plot padding would have made me feel better about it.But back to the movie as a whole. Nick Stahl plays John now (it was Edward Furlong in the second, in his debut), and he does a great job. He looks a lot like Ed Furlong probably looks now. Kate Brewster is played by Claire Danes. Yes, Claire Danes! A bit of an unusual role for her, but she can do plucky and empathetic. And of course, Arnold Schwarzenegger is back as the T-800, the original Terminator. There's one cameo by a character who had a big role in the second Terminator movie, and it's a funny one, too.Will you enjoy this movie? I think you will, but it's not going to blow you away like the first or second may have. Arnold carries this movie for the most part, because he doesn't have Linda Hamilton from the other films (as John's mother, Sarah) to help him out. Hamilton was a big reason that T2 was so successful - her role made it more than a Guys Smash Stuff movie. This one doesn't quite escape that fate, however.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

I hadn't hyped myself up for it, being that I loved ""T1"" and liked ""T2"".  So I went to see it today and I was pretty blown away by it. Clearly James Cameron, who directed both ""T1"" and ""T2"", is not here to direct ""T3"".  Jonathan Mostow, who I have never heard of until this film, really knows how to direct a ""Terminator"" film.      I should tell you all that there is definitely going to be a ""Terminator 4"". Do not let the films title ""Rise of the Machines"" mislead you in any way, since by films end, the machines have risen and the war has started.  Arnold Schwarzenegger is good as always, as is Nick Stahl (filling in for Edward Furlong) as John Conner.  Claire Danes, who I have never really paid much attention to (other than ""Romeo & Juliet"" in 1996), is also pretty convincing too.  Of course, the real light here is Kristanna Loken as the T-X, who is even better than Robert Patrick's T-1000.

77,alindsay-al,a really poor sequel that shouldn't have been made,3,1 July 2015,after the phenomenal sequel judgement day it took twelve years for the third film in the franchise and I wish it never happened and they should have left it with just the first two films. The premise of this film sees a terminator sent back in time to protect John Connor and his future wife from being killed by a future terminator and also to try and prevent judgement day from truly happening. Now Arnold Schwarzenegger is back as the terminator and even though he does an alright job this is not the same performance as the terminator as before. He just seems like he is exhausted at times and can't be bothered and this was the first film where they really started to parody the terminator and make him a joke. They recast John Connor with actor Nick stahl and he just was not a good fit for the character. I understand where the character was he just didn't portray him very well and he didn't develop at all in the film and i never saw him getting closer to the leader of the resistance. Claire Danes is in the film and she is alright in the film and develops in the film with her performance being good. Also the villain the TX was a good villain and the character was perfect as the evil terminator of the film. The story didn't work either with it becoming way too convoluted and to a certain extent it takes away from the previous films. It has some decent ideas but really fails to deliver them and I feel like the characters didn't grow on me that much. The script is awful with the dialogue not hitting with any of the characters and they don't allow the characters to expand and become more interesting like previous films characters. There are some pretty cool action scenes like the truck scene and the church scene but then there are some over the top cgi scenes that just look really bad. Overall this is a poor film that you won't like unless you are a huge terminator fan and very forgiving.,Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

He teams up with Kate Brewster (Clare Danes) who is also to have a key part in saving mankind's future, whilst Arnie comes back as a re-programmed terminator to defend them both.For fans of Episodes 1 and 2, Rise of the Machines fills in some necessary history, and does it well. For newcomers, this treat is no money-machine pap growing fat on the name of its predecessors: Terminator 3 is well scripted, well directed, and (as far as such one-dimensional characters require it) well acted. But the thing that really makes it is the excellent pacing and editing that keeps the suspense going through climax after climax.

The second one was more cerebral and polished, trading terror for white-knuckle action. 'Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines' is merely a generic summer popcorn movie. The script is thin, recycling old ideas without any of the careful craft that Cameron originally put into them. Also missing is the crucial relationship building that gave the first two films their heart.Arnold returns, looking remarkable for a man in his late 50s, but his Terminator here lacks the cold menace of the original or the sly wit of his 'T2' counterpart. Nick Stahl is surprisingly effective as John Conner, but his character is unfortunately underwritten. ""Heroine"" Claire Danes mostly just screams and villain Kristianna Loken is nothing but eye candy as the eye-rollingly named Terminatrix.Though it breezes by at a fast clip, 'Rise of the Machines' is a weak and uninspired successor to the two legendary originals.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
81,smatysia,The machines rise anyway,8,12 March 2004,"Where to start? I tend to agree with other reviewers (and James Cameron) that there was no really compelling reason to make this film. This one, thematically, mirrors the previous one. And also, like, for instance, the third ""Lethal Weapon"" movie, this third ""Terminator"" film becomes partly a self-parody. But to give credit where credit is due, the action sequences were very impressive, and the crane chase will be a classic scene. (However, chases in inappropriate vehicles are sort of a trademark sinking into the self-parody mentioned earlier.) Schwarzenegger has found a character that certainly matches his acting ability. It's sort of too bad that he will be too old to ever make another ""Terminator"" film, although that probably wouldn't stop the studio if they thought the money was there. Claire Danes was pretty good here, as was Kristianna Loken. There is plenty of room to quibble about the various time travel paradoxes, and some other plot holes. I have to give the filmmakers some credit for the lack of a typical Hollywood feel-good ending.

Nick Stahl looked tired, Claire Danes had the same face throughout the movie and Kristanna Loken was trying hard to copy Arnold and Robert Patrick.CGI of the movie is good and must be appreciated. Action scenes of the movie were also superb and must be appreciated.Overall this movie is nothing but just a cocktail of it's previous movies, this movie might have been unbearable if Arnold Schwarzenegger was not been there and the entire movie is been resting on his reliable and powerful shoulders.

But I bet I was the only one there for the continuing story, as I was the only who seemed to get the comments and jokes in reference to the past movies so I guess they hadn't seen the other ""T"" movies. Arnold's lines were pretty much just replay references to the older movies. I'm not sure I got all the plot points in the quiet dialogs, such as they were, in the lulls between car crashes -- sent back to do what, when, by whom? And while the vehicle chases were now construction cranes and fire trucks, it was just metal upon noisy metal upon more noisy metal. It's becoming common in sci fi these days to have the best way for an alien enemy to infiltrate humans is in disguise as a gorgeous blonde, let alone an indestructible one.But what made the movie for me was the wonderful in context line in the midst of one counter-attack: Nick Stahl as the grown-up ""John Connor"" looking in wonder at Claire Danes: ""You remind me of my mother.""(originally written 8/31/2003)",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

But I was surprised. This is one of very few sequels that I actually liked better than the movies which it followed.Like the previous movies there are very elaborated action and fighting scenes were everything seems to be highly explosive. Well that was expected and the fighting scenes are pretty much what they were in t-2. However, I must say that they actually makes the mandatory car chase a great thrill because of the vehicles use, or specifically the one T-x uses (boy, I must get me one of those). I agree that is clearly noticeable that it is not James Cameron that directed this movie. Instead of, or maybe I should put it, in addition to just being your ordinary action-thriller, this movie also sports a heave element of comedy. And this is what I think really elevates this movie above its predecessors. The comedy-bit is handled very-good so it really enhances the movie instead of destroying the suspense, however I would like to call it action-comedy because of that, it feels more accurate.There are two things that annoys me though. First, why do people that are chased or in any situation were they are in short supply of time keep stopping up, just looking around and being a tourist, why? Second, Kristanna Loken as T-x seemed very much like a robot to me with constantly plain facial expressions. When I saw the movie I thought this was fine, however, when I read the trivia I learned that she had trained in communicating with facial expressions.

There are no more angles to approach, unless you introduce yet another new Terminator that is faster and more powerful than the original. Hopefully, Arnold will be worrying more about politics than another Terminator sequel because we simply don't need one. I will admit, many of the special effects shots and the chase scenes were rather cool, but it seemed so predictable in the grand scheme of things.

He and a childhood friend are being protected by another terminator while trying to escape the T-X and avert a nuclear holocaust caused by Skynet, a US military computer network.This movie has the standard modern-day Hollywood blockbuster virtues and vices - it's great-looking, fast-paced and has some terrific action and special effects, but the plot is a lame rehash of another movie (in this case, Terminator 2: Judgement Day), the characters are uninteresting and the film lacks any kind of depth or atmosphere. If only they'd stop making movies by committee, with three writers and nine producers, and give the director some creative control. However, there is a lot to enjoy in this film - Loken is wonderful as the sinister T-X, cheerfully murdering people and reprogramming machines to do her bidding, and it's fun to see a petite girl in a jumpsuit throwing big Arnie around. The stuntwork by Simon Crane is fantastic, as are the visual effects by Pablo Helman, Don Taylor and Stan Winston, and there are some great sets, costumes and chases, especially when the T-X hijacks a crane and destroys half of downtown Los Angeles. Schwarzenegger gives it his all (this was his last movie before being elected Governor of California) but was much better in the original movie as the bad guy, romantic leads Stahl and Danes do what they can with their ropey dialogue (""It all makes sense now !!""), and Boen has an offbeat cameo reprising his character from the previous two movies.

The production people got board of the current day and wanted to film the future instead and the story of this film gets them there.Arnie isn't as robotic as the previous instalments which is a bit distracting and I would still prefer him as the bad guy, but the TX is pretty awesome.There are some great comedic moments, but I wonder if they were all necessary for this type of film.I didn't really like the actor playing John Connor, but I can see how he would have grown from the brat in 'Judgement Day' and then grown to be Christian Bale's version in film number four.I have actually seen this one before, but I couldn't remember what happened, perhaps because it's not the most original story.

'The Terminator' and 'Terminator 2: Judgement Day' had some humor but most of all it had great action with beautiful special effects and they were meant seriously. It had some ideas about time traveling that made the movies more interesting. This second sequel does not take itself too seriously. The special effects are there, but the way they play with the time traveling this time is just too much. Fortunately there is some great humor in this one, another sign that you must not take it too seriously.I had a feeling the story didn't matter much, which it did with the first two. Everything was made for some thrilling moments, pretty well done, some great special effects and some nice humor. The new terminator called Terminatrix, played by Kristanna Loken, is nice but the Arnold Schwarzenegger from the first and the Robert Patrick from the second film had something Loken is missing. I didn't like Nick Stahl as well. Edward Furlong was so great in 'T2' that Nick Stahl almost looks bad. The scenes with him and his future wife played by Claire Danes are sometimes a little annoying.May be it sounds like I didn't like the movie very much. That is definitely not true. Because it is a sequel I compare with the other movies from the series and it can't win from those first two movies. But compare it with almost any other sci-fi action movie and this one is better. It is very well made, has suspense and humor and Schwarzenegger is back in the role perfect for him.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
92,Samiam3,How dare they!?,3,24 March 2009,"Considering what happens at the end of 'T2', everything that happens in Terminator 3 is impossible (don't even get me started). This fact alone should be a good enough reason why not to make this movie and rob the other two films of their dignity. Terminator 3 does practically everything wrong, but the worst thing it does is leave the story open for Terminator 4 (or what we now know as Terminator Salvation)The best way to summarize Terminator 3 is to say that this movie shows us how the war between man and machine begins, and how John Conner becomes the one who is destined to save mankind. This may sound like an exciting premise, but it results in a movie that does not belong anywhere near Jim Cameron's genius creations. The script is rubbish. It literally steals plot points from Terminator and T2, and then attempts to make a better movie out of them by adding more mindless action and special effects, neither of which is remotely useful to the story. Instead of being thrilling and epic, the action sequences are confusing and rather dull. The acting is terrible, and the characterization is even worse. The protagonists do virtually nothing but fight, and fight, and fight, and try to survive. It all happens so fast with no character interaction, no suspense, no adventure, and no emotion. Terminator 3 isn't worth your time.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
93,Sherazade,Packs some serious heat!,8,11 July 2006,"This is my favourite of the trilogy (of course part 1 is the undisputed classic and part 2 was just way too scary and off target for me), but I like the fact that they used a woman this time to portray that indestructible killing machine hellbent on annihilating John and Sarah Connor. Half the job is already complete by the time Kristiana Loken takes over the task but she still manages to kick some major butt and do some amazing stunts in her or shall I say (its) pursuit of John (played now by Nick Stahl) and his unwilling tag along girlfriend (played by Claire Danes). Naturally, an aging Arnold is back as the bad guy turned good guy hell bent on protecting John come what may and he does a pretty neat job. This film is worth seeing at least once or as part of the three film marathon.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
94,rosscinema,He's back!,7,20 July 2003,"While not exactly up to the excellence of the first two films I do think this is a worthy sequel to this franchise. Story has John Conner (Nick Stahl) now in his 20's who is basically a drifter and he is still haunted by the events that took place a decade ago. One night in Beverly Hills a new terminator appears (Kristanna Loken) and it takes on the appearance of a beautiful woman and its mission is of course to find Conner. Conner is hiding out at a veterinarians office and early one morning Kate Brewster (Claire Danes) who works there comes to work and finds John. Turns out the two of them went to high school together and suddenly the terminator T-X shows up. Meanwhile, in the desert the older model of terminator appears (Arnold Schwarzenegger) and his mission is to make sure John and Kate survive Judgement Day because their children will become important in the future. The old terminator saves them both and there is a very destructive car chase that involves police cars, fire trucks and a big crane. They go to a funeral home in the desert and find the coffin of Sarah Conner which is full of weapons. Kate's father is an Air Force officer named Robert Brewster (David Andrews) and he is in charge of a top secret program that involves this countries weapons system. Its the key to Judgement Day and the three of them race to his installation and try and stop the impending destruction. This film was directed by Jonathan Mostow who demonstrated in ""U-571"" that he could handle a difficult assignment like this. Its not quite up to the first two films and one reason would be the special effects. T2 gave us effects that would change the way films would look. This one does not, but its not that these effects are bad. Their not! But at the same time they're not ground breaking. And Loken as the terminatrix just doesn't come across as we would expect. She is so beautiful and I found it symbolic that she entered our time by emerging out of a Beverly Hills shop window! Its symbolic because she has the look of a mannequin. T2 didn't make Robert Patrick a huge star and I doubt that this will for Loken either. But this still is a very exciting and entertaining film. One thing that this film did was to make sure Schwarzenegger act like a cyborg and not show human emotions. T2 had one glaring flaw in it that still makes me angry to this day. Its at the end of the film where he tells Edward Furlong ""I'm sorry"". Sorry? He's a cyborg! He doesn't feel emotions. And in this film that mistake does not happen, thank god. I was so relieved by that. The film sets up itself for another sequel and it does so with a dark ending that was more in line with the first film. It didn't come across to me as a silly and contrived ending that was only put in for money purposes. I think a continuation is essential and the ending is believable as far as this story is concerned. Arnold has his trademark ""One liners"" throughout the film and in one humorous scene actor Earl Boen reprises his role as Dr. Peter Silberman and along with Schwarzenegger he is the only actor to appear in all three films. The first Terminator was a brutally dark and brilliant film and the second was a very interesting story with ground breaking special effects. This film is not up to those two but it is a worthy sequel that is never boring for one second. On a simple level, its just plain fun to watch Schwarzenegger in these films. One of the most indelible characters in movie history. Lets see T4!",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
95,invisibleunicornninja,An unintentional comedy.,5,16 March 2018,"This movie is just stupid. I was laughing for most of the runtime. On a technical level, this movie is fine. The way its shot is great, but aesthetics don't make a movie. The acting is worse than the previous movies, and the script is a mess. Most of the characters act like complete morons. I would not recommend this movie. Its not even worth watching for comedic purposes because of how frustratingly stupid most of the characters are. Its almost hard to believe that this movie came from the two before it.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
96,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,Still entertaining even if Cameron isn't at the wheel,9,30 December 2012,"We all know that after Terminator 2: Judgement Day (1991), Arnold Schwarzenegger stated that he would not continue the Terminator franchise unless James Cameron was directing. Apparently he did not follow through on his word. Schwarzenegger is back as his metal counterpart to save John Connor once more from being killed off so he can save the human race from Skynet becoming self-aware.And even though James Cameron did not even take part in this film at all, director Jonathan Mostow looks like he put a lot of work into this less appreciated sequel too. John Connor (Nick Stahl) is now in his 20's and feels depressed because he can't do anything with his life. Perhaps the reason was that judgment day didn't happen...yet, but he didn't know that. This time, Schwarzenegger comes back as a modified Terminator, the T-850 to protect Connor from his strongest opponent yet; the T-X. The T-X is played by model Kristanna Loken. Loken makes her character quite believable and lethal at the same time. Although she barely shows any emotion, she looks like she had a good time being her character. Killing victims and all. Loken is part of what makes this sequel work. Even Earl Boen (Dr. Silberman) has an appearance for a brief time to treat the fans of the franchise. The action is still very intense and the violence is still very brutal.The only weak points I see is Marco Beltrami's film score and Nick Stahl. Beltrami does recall Brad Fiedel's theme from the first two films but his rendition gets lost in the softer more sentimental scenes. As for Stahl, perhaps he wasn't the best choice as an older John Connor. His looks don't quite make out as a rough and tough leader. But all around, this sequel still packs a punch.The third terminator film has good performances from Loken and Schwarzenegger. Even if it's missing James Cameron.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

This movie is notable for launching the career of Kristanna Loken, a model who is probably the sexiest Terminator alive. Claire Danes pre homeland stars in this film along with other stars. Lots of good action scenes make up for a weird plot about the rise of the machines as well as male terminator vs female terminator. I'm glad James Cameron is working with Tim Miller on Dark Fate which will conclude the Terminator saga on a high note and be a swan song for Arnold as he approaches 80 years old...",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
98,Easygoer10,"Bad, But Humorous",6,29 December 2019,"(12/29/2019). For me, this is the 2nd worst film in the entire 6 volume ""Terminator"" films. If you go by numbers, only ""Terminator Genisys"" (2015), is the absolute worst, simply because the crew & director took it completely seriously. It is absolutely woeful. On the other hand, this film is far too comical. For me, I like the original film the most. It was made in 1984. This was a time when James Cameron had very few resources. However, as a result of the commercial success, 2 years later he released ""Aliens"" (1986); the sequel to Ridley Scott's brilliant 1979 film (""Alien""). Highly successful commercially, plus Sigourney Weaver got a ""Best Actress"" Oscar nomination. 3 years later he made the most commercially successful of all the ""Terminator"" films with ""Terminator 2: Judgement Day"" (1992). For Cameron, the rest is history. Next came this film, then (the 4th) ""Terminator Salvation"" (2009) which was very well cast (but no Arnold!), plus it had a decent script. Then the aforementioned (horrible) 5th film, ""Terminator Genisys"" (2015). Finally, after 3 different directors had poor to mediocre success, James Cameron returns to this genre. It is after he has made ""Titanic"" (1997) and Avatar"" (2009). Only now he has both Arnold Schwarznegger and Linda Hamilton in the 6th (and hopefully last) film in this series with ""Terminator: Dark Fate"". It was just released (Nov. 1, 2019) to mixed reviews. Regardless, this film has a few decent moments. I do like Arnold, Nick Stahl and Claire Danes. Also, it gave Kristanna Loken a big break.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
99,Rob_Taylor,He'll be back......,8,11 July 2003,"Well, I liked this movie. Granted it was very similar to number 2, even had similar scenes in it, but at least it was harmless fun. And, of course, it had big Arn in it. The supporting stars were OK too, not brilliant, but not dire.If you liked the second of the series, then this one will not disappoint you (unless you were angling for something different). Some of it is a little trite and, needless to say, it is almost entirely predictable, right down to the final scenes. But its Arnie, doing what Arnie does best.....breaking things.There are some nice views of the prototype hunter-killers that characterised the flashbacks in the second movie. But I swear one of the T1's shrugged after looking down a corridor for the intruders (Arnie and Co). Might have been my imagination, though.Anyway, good fun, but nothing new.

100,vengeance20,Solid Action 3rd Entry!,8,30 September 2020,"Saw this film awhile back some point in '09 & thought it was pretty epic. I mean I'd only seen bits & pieces of mind & mostly only seen the action sequences. But now fast forward 11 Years & I have finally got around to watching this was a more mature mindset.Now after watching I can say it still is a great action film, though I must also say it's not as good as T2. But I think the hate this one gets isn't justified in the slightest, I mean hell in not just in itself but in comparison to the Woke Stinker we got last year this film is bloody Oscar worthy!The film follows Skynet sending a new terminator T-X back in time to John Connors present to instead kill other top members of the future Human Resistance, thereby ensuring Skynet's rise as Skynet fails to find John in the past. A T-800 Terminator is sent to protect John Connor from the T-X Terminator which is this time a female.I found the plot like the others to be fairly straight forward, only this being the 3rd installment was a bit of a mouth full. The action was how I remember it, top notch & on point & never failed to amuse. Unlike Dark Fate, the female adding in this film for a terminator entry wasn't a woke shoehorned attempt at all in the leftist PC department & actually quite welcoming. Never mind a bit of eye candy for us lads...!The film was a little overly long I must say & the plot was a tiny bit muddled & confusing but maybe it's because i need to re-watch a few more times I don't know.Overall a solid 3rd entry to the Terminator Franchise! 8/10",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
101,screenman,The Machine Stops.,5,3 July 2008,"It's such a pity that Hollywood seems almost incapable of realising when a franchise has run its course. So, they go on. And on.Two terminators were quite enough. The first was a creepy, almost B-movie horror flick - simple, but eminently well presented. 'Judgement Day' on the other hand, was a truly epic work of science fantasy. Between the two they used up all of the ideas associated with the concept. There was nothing else to play for. So why then not finish on a high note? Because there's still money in it; that's why. Like prospectors mining gold, they just can't accept that the vein has run out.OK, what else can we do that's new? I know; how about a female terminator? We can always build a story round that. Yes. Actually, the T1000 of 'Judgement Day' was itself capable of completely mimicking any human females it killed, so what was the point of a dedicated design? I won't go on. Objective critics have seen all of the movie's shortcomings. Only nerds sat back and gaped in awe at this one.Yes; the new effects were excellent. The tanks that had a hint of 'Robocop' about them were highly believable hokum, as were the flying machines. But we'd seen them all before, just fewer in number. The acting was plausible but hardly set the screen on fire. Arnie actually looked bored in this outing, which is something of an acting revelation for him. And the script was - well - cheesy.Judgement Day it transpires was, after all, unavoidable. It took an extra two hours of repetitive, rehashed celluloid mayhem of slaughter, truck-chases, and shattering glass to tell us that? I don't think so.Watching inadequate sequels to favourite movies is rather like seeing old friends dying from some wasting illness.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
102,brando647,Unimaginative Sequel Fails to Bring Anything New to Series...,6,14 December 2009,"One of my biggest pet peeves in modern film is the creation of completely unnecessary sequels to fantastic movies. Here, we have a prime example. In my opinion, the TERMINATOR franchise would've been better off if it'd ended with the conclusion of James Cameron's TERMINATOR 2; I really wish he'd gone with his original ending showing how Judgment Day had been avoided, thereby putting a halt to future installments. Sadly, this was not the case and in 2003 Jonathan Mostow brought us the third film in the saga. The plot is nothing we haven't seen before in two other films: the future finds the human race at war with the machines (run by Skynet) and again, an attempt is made to put an end to the human resistance movement before the war ever starts. Skynet sends a new, upgraded model of Terminator to 2003 to kill John Connor, Kate Brewster (his future wife and second-in-command), and his future lieutenants. In response, the future resistance sends back another T-800 Terminator to protect him until Judgment Day passes.So, essentially what we have here is TERMINATOR 2 all over again, without some of the best aspects of what made the second film so great: James Cameron's writing/direction, Linda Hamilton, Robert Patrick, etc). The new villain, the Terminatrix, is basically a higher-tech mash-up of the first two (a weaponized endo-skeleton and a morphing liquid metal alloy) except this time it's a woman. Too much of the film feels like a rehashing of everything we've seen that most of it is forgettable until the final 30 minutes. Once Skynet goes online and Judgment Day officially arrives, the movie becomes more entertaining as we see early Hunter-Killers and T-1's rampage through a military base. The battles between the Terminators are impressive and fun to watch, but the film wanders a little too far into camp for my tastes. Some scenes, particularly the T-800's arrival in a roadside bar for ladies' night, may elicit chuckles from some but had me groaning.One element that fails to live up to the first films are the performances of the cast. With the exception of Arnold Schwarzeneggar as the T-800 Terminator (he invented the role and he really can't go wrong), the cast doesn't strike the same chord. Nick Stahl does a decent job as John Connor and seems to be a suitable replacement for Edward Furlong but Claire Danes (as Kate Brewster) spends the majority of the movie freaking out and Loken (as the Terminatrix) tries to invoke the cold, soulless killer that was Robert Patrick's T-1000 but never quite has the same effect. If a third Terminator film was really necessary, I wish Mostow and the writers had gone a little further and tried to create a unique story to grab the audience's attention, rather than feeding us the same old formula (especially with the utilization of Judgment Day as a plot point, there's so much potential there). You won't be bored by TERMINATOR 3, as it's a halfway decent action movie, but fans of the franchise who were hoping for an explosive follow-up to Cameron's T2 probably won't find what they were hoping for.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
103,moviewizguy,Better than The Terminator,7,23 April 2006,"On the verge of Judgement Day, the most advanced Terminator unit ever, the T-X, arrives from the future to ensure the rise of the machines. The only hope against it is a new upgraded T-800 unit, the T-850, that is sent back by the human resistance. Together with John Connor, it must stop the rise of the machines or all humanity will fall.Like i've said in my past reviews, I never appreciated the concept of people going back in time to do all these things so this will happen in the future as much as other people did. However, the second movie decided to top it off. Nw the reason to watch this movie is to find out why is there still a Judgement Day and what happened to John Connor's mother.Well, they decided to take the easy and risk-free way out of it, turning this into a big, fun, and loud action film. Well, it's worth it. Although it doesn't put the mind into the plot, it certainly is (ironically) a better movie than the first.Now you guys might go crazy because I said this. I just like it a lot more than the first film, although not as good as the second. The action scenes are tons better than the first two films and the CGI really done well. The plot is still the same as ever and the dialog is campy and fun.So the general word in this film is ""fun"". Don't take it too seriously. It has a lot of humor and equal drama. The action sequences are fantastic and has one of the best car chase sequences I've ever seen. Arnold Schwarzenegger has a bigger and better role in here and Kristanna Loken, playing the new Terminatrix, has a perfect performance. Her role on the Terminator is great! It's just that good! The other two (Nick Stahl and Claire Danes) were also good.The score, although not the same as the first two, is good. The direction by Jonathan Mostow is good, although this sequel is unnecessary.If you would just like to have a good fun time on a popcorn movie, this is the film for you.

104,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"""Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines""- A soulless retread of previous films, but still fairly entertaining.",5,2 February 2017,"Sometimes, a series just isn't meant to continue. After delivering a solid and exceptionally well-made Sci-Fi thriller with 1984's ""The Terminator"", director James Cameron followed it up with one of the greatest action films ever made with his 1991 sequel ""T2: Judgment Day."" But it would be twelve long years before a third film in the iconic franchise. Twelve years of rumors and speculation and hopes and dreams on the part of film-goers the world over. But when details on the production of ""Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines"" started to emerge, fans grew noticeably (and rightfully) concerned. Especially with the loss of series creator Cameron, here replaced with director Jonathan Mostow and a small army of screenwriters.Would it live up to the long-building hype? Could it come even close to matching the essentially perfect quality of the previous films? Would it be another great installment in the franchise?Well, despite an upfront warm reception from critics and general audiences, the answer to these questions in retrospect is sadly a resounding ""No!"" While ""Terminator 3"" is far from being a terrible film, it's unfortunately a painfully generic and often soulless retread of the far superior second chapter, filled to burst with contrived winks and nods tossed in to win over fans... but never feeling necessary or even particularly fulfilling. Yes, it is entertaining enough to warrant a one-time viewing. But on the whole, it's just a prime example of an unneeded continuation to a perfect and self-contained tale.We pick up some time after the previous tale, as John Connor (Nick Stahl) has grown paranoid about his future, and lives ""off the grid."" However, he is forced to face his possible destiny as a savior of mankind once again when a new Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) arrives from the future to protect him from another threat- the T-X (Kristanna Loken), a new model that combines liquid metal with an endoskeleton armed to the teeth with future-weaponry. At the same time, a mysterious computer virus is striking all over the world, and the military contemplates using the newly-completed Skynet system to eradicate it, not knowing the power that Skynet has and the destructive consequences its activation would cause.To give the film credit, there are some elements at play that do indeed work. Schwarzenegger is a joy as always, and it's a blast seeing him reprise what is perhaps his most well-known and beloved role on- screen. The rest of the cast plays their roles well, and there isn't really any sore thumbs. Mostow also delivers some genuinely thriller sequences of action and adventure, including a phenomenal and wildly explosive car-chase early on that still holds up well to this day and is one of the best sequences of the entire franchise. I also thought that despite not quite matching the high- bar set by ""Judgement Day"", newcomer composer Marco Beltrami does an adequate and admirable job with the film's score. He gets the tone quite well, and while his themes are never as memorable as Brad Fiedel's prior work, it gets the job done with style.Unfortunately, some great action and performances can't really overcome the biggest issue, which is that this is a really bland and blatant inferior copy of what's come before. Too much of the film is devoted to just trying to match the last film beat-for-beat, to the point it feels borderline condescending. To try and avert this, Mostow and the writers pepper in comedic subversions, but they just feel contrived at best. (Do we really need to see Arnold wearing a male-strippers ""Star Sunglasses"" as a gag?) The film feels without soul or identity because it plays it far too safe for its own good. And thus it can be tedious to sit through on a second or third viewing.There's also just a slew of issues I have regarding the general writing and production. The film's pacing is a bit of a mess, and key segments feel left out and poorly established. The idea of the villain being a female Terminator is fascinating and could work, but Loken comes across as miscast looking back. She lacks menace and plays the role a bit too ""sexy."" (They really needed someone like a Lucy Lawless or an Uma Thurman in this role.) And it lacks the polish of Cameron's work with flat cinematography and sometimes uninspired choices in shots and composition.Still, it's not a total loss. The story is just solid enough to be worth checking out, the action is great and it's good fun seeing the Terminator back in action. It's not a great film, but ""Terminator 3"" also isn't objectively terrible. I say give it a shot once if you're curious, because there is some definite fun to be had. But I'd mainly suggest just sticking to the first two.I give ""Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines"" a mediocre 5 out of 10.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

Racing against the clock, will John Connor succeed and save the future of mankind, or does mankind have a dark future ahead of them?The first two films were quite impressive, the first film dealt with the Terminator traveling back in time to assassinate Sarah Connor and her then-unborn son John Connor to prevent the war, and the second film followed the next terminator traveling back in time to protect John Connor from being killed by T-1000 as he was supposed to be the future resistance leader in the war against the machines. This film, directed by Jonathan Mostow, continues the story of the franchise, while this demonstrating some pulse-pounding action sequences and a compelling premise, it sadly falls short of the excitement that made the first two films entertaining. This movie continues the story on a rather middling note. From the first ten minutes, we are introduced to the evil robot T-X driving around town and executing these targeted civilians who serve no relevance to the plot. Then we are introduced to CSM-101 who arrives at a strip bar to steal the clothes and car keys of a bouncer, similar to what we saw in Terminator 2 with T-800. There is also the intense, but exciting special effects-heavy car chase scene with CSM-101, similar to the motorcycle chase with John Connor and T-1000. These two scenes, while full of excitement, play a great homage to the events of the last films to where it almost feels it is repeating the same events from the previous movie. From there on, the plot becomes less and less interesting, the action becomes less compelling, and the characters seem a bit tiresome. The main thing the characters are lacking is good dialogue and writing. Thus, they end up becoming less memorable. While the actions manages to keep the film standing, this film itself suffers in many places, especially the ending which I found rather anticlimactic, even though it sets the tone for the next film.Terminator 3: Rise of The Machines did not live up to my expectations and fell inferior to the last two films, especially the second one which I consider the best of the franchise. I believe this could have been better if it was handled by James Cameron who was responsible of the last two movies.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
111,Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187,It's okay.,6,22 November 2019,"Terminator 3 has the misfortune of following up on Terminator 1 & 2: an impossibly difficult task that can only result in shortcomings if James Cameron, Gale Anne Hurd and Linda Hamilton aren't even touching this production at all. Terminator 3 is a noble if fatally flawed follow-up on two of sci-fi cinema's greatest stories; there was no way Terminator 3 could follow up on the T-1000 in Judgement Day and the story there was wrapped up just nicely. So where was the real need to continue? Well, it was because Judgement Day was a box office tsunami: and they HAD to do a sequel in some form I guess.Terminator 3 is a well-meaning but overly-stuffed and pandering venture in the Terminator canon. It's loaded with fan-service in reference to the first two Terminators: there's that psychologist from the first two movies, and the T-800's pacifism in T-2 is visually referenced in the form of 'Human Casualties: 000' screen-text from Arnie's point-of-view. Noble efforts, but it's unnecessary if it doesn't add anything new to the story.T-3 is okay. It's passable action and escapism, but the original Terminator and Judgement Day are still the best by a ridiculously wide margin.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
112,oneguyrambling,The non-Arnie scenes are a total drag. Good thing he's in quite a few.,6,8 June 2011,"Is it a fluke that Arnie appeared in arguably half a dozen of the best action flicks in a decade? Was Arnie simply handed all the best roles? Was he given a free ride? Was he unbelievably lucky? Or is he actually a credible leading man and commanding screen presence? I think the answer for me came when I watched T3 last week. About half way through I realised what a dud movie this was in almost every sans-Arnie scene. His Terminator arrives maybe a third of the way in, and as a one guy audience the only thing that allows you to remain involved is knowing he's coming, when he departs proceedings it's 100% dullsville from there.+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ Like many inferior sequels the film opens with a brief narration that serves as a recap for any action fan living under a rock for 20 years – in the future robots send back a cyborg assassin to kill a boy / young man named John Connor destined to become the fearless leader of humankind hellbent on fighting the robot occupation repeatedly.The first time the cyborg was Arnie. The second time it was a slick liquid metal cyborg and the obsolete Arnie was reprogrammed to defend Connor. This time Arnie is once again the protector and the assassin is once again liquid metal, but this time the assassin is a hot chick – and she has wayyyy more toys and tricks than previous Terminators.The rest is a carbon copy of T2 really, only 10 years on. Nick Stahl as John Connor is serviceable but he either did the steely-determined thing very well or he simply lacks personality, his future love interest Kathryn is played by the huge-eyed Claire Danes, the psychiatrist is back once again to continue his running joke – but aside from all that it is Arnie standing in front of a relentless killing machine for 2 hours.That isn't to say that the film is without merit, it tackles the responsibility of copying a classic very seriously, but when you are taking on one of the best 4 or 5 films in history that's a pretty tall order.+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ So after Kristina Lokken appears – naked – as the female Terminator (needless to say if she remained naked they would have sold millions more DVDs, she is a well built cyborg) she instantly sets about killing off various members of the resistance, who are all in their teens or early 20s at this stage. Lokken's Terminator is again liquid metal but this time can produce a veritable handyman's arsenal of tools and weapons, including a big f-you cannon from her arm.Arnold arrives in the desert a short while later, and the two set about punching and shooting at each other all over the very state that Arnold would eventually lead.I must admit that the first big chase is worthy of direct comparison with almost anything from T2, there are remote controlled cop cars, ambulances, a big mobile crane – which Arnold spends a great deal of time hanging off – and even a fire engine. It is a three year old boy's toyset on the bigscreen (my 3 year old actually does plays with all those things). The scene itself runs for maybe 10 minutes, it has the requisite ""big"" explosions and collisions, showcases the new lady-Terminator's abilities and Arnie's dogged determination, and best of all it all seems quite dangerous. Too often now chase scenes are just the lazy action-filler in films, there is little in the way of adrenaline or the perception of peril, the fact that this scene was so outstanding perhaps makes the rest of the film look a little shabbier by comparison.After a couple more not quite so good chases and a shootout in a cemetery (which fell a little flat), John and Kathryn are told that Arnie must protect them so that they and their children will fight the machines later on. Seeing as how they only met each other a few hours previous, and that Kathryn up until that morning had a fiancé you could safely call that an icebreaker. Talk about arranged marriage; this is arranged kids! With Judgment Day inevitable and looming large it was a little disappointing to find the finale a little underwhelming, perhaps too clinical and formulaic, which seems obvious given I have already pointed this out as a replica of T2.Arnold and Lady-T go roboto-a-roboto and cause millions of dollars in property damage, and all the while John Connor and Kathryn seem to stay just far enough and just close enough to danger.The lady-Terminator seemed deadly but a little dumb, many times she had a target in her vice like grip and instead of squeezing them to death, snapping their bones like crackers or just pummeling them into oblivion she repeatedly threw them away.I guess even robots should learn not to send a woman to do a man's job.I firmly believe that there is another ""Great"" Terminator film to be made – last year's effort was OK but hardly a classic. More than anything this frankly mediocre effort showed just how much the franchise relied on Arnie to flourish, when a 60 year old man playing a giant killer robot is far and away the best thing going for your film it highlights how pivotal Arnie really is, finding his effective replacement might be near impossible, but it doesn't mean they shouldn't try.Final Rating – 6 / 10. The non-Arnie scenes are a total drag, but that one mega-chase elevates this up a notch. The film might not be required viewing, but that scene sure is.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
113,Sirus_the_Virus,Enjoyable.,7,4 August 2009,"Termionator 3: Rise of the machines is part of the third part curse. Though it's not the weakest in the series. The Plot: Arnold Swartzenegger returns as a new Terminator model. He is sent back once a gain to protect John Conner, the future resistance leader, and Kate Brewster,who is John's future wife. The Terminator has a new villain. The T-X, who is stronger,and could easily defeat The Terminator. The plot isn't quite as complex as the first two films. Terminator 3: Rise of the machines is a good summer film. Though it came out six years ago, it was good for it's time. I love Claire Danes and was surprised when I found out that she was in it. Kristanna Loken (who's Michelle Rodriguez's lover)is a pretty good villain. I was rooting for her while watching the film, though I knew she was going to lose. But both Arnold and her blew up. I am giving Terminator 3: Rise of the machines a recommendation. The problem I have with it is that I don't like Nick Stahl as John Conner. I Don't think this film is as well thought out as the others. Though it's more thought out than Terminator: Salvation, which I gave the same rating. Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is occasionally funny and entertaining.

114,lambiepie-2,"Popcorn Movie...nothing more, nothing less",3,5 July 2003,"It seems like the problem with a lot of reviews is that many are forgetting this series is called: ""The Terminator"", and that is what is continuing to happen in Terminator 3.""John Connor"" is looking to be terminated by the machines who rule existence in the future -- come heck or high water. That is THEIR plan which is the whole point of these films. Send a machine, or machines, to kill John Connor or to possibly SAVE John Connor. Once you get that in your brain, nothing else matters. What we are seeing is what occurs in and around John's life as this happens and why these machines NEED for it to happen. Remember that, and you may -- or may not -- enjoy, Terminator 3.With that in mind, who cares if Arnold is there or not. He's a lovely ""familiar"" addition, but by no means the make or break all of the central idea. This franchise CAN go on without him. Arnold's character (if you want to call it that) is a TYPE of machine model that will either save or destroy John Connor. Depends on who's programming what at which time...This terminator MODEL has the same face. Arnold's. Do not be surprised if the next Terminator movie (God Forbid, hut hey, money is money) has several Arnolds in it and ya don't know which is ""good"" or ""bad"". There are other advanced models sent as we now are aware such as...the ""Robert Patrick"" model and this Barbie doll from a Rodeo drive window. (As a resident of Beverly Hills I take offense, she should have been at least 53 years old, and should have came out of a plastic surgeon's chair as she was getting rhinoplasty/breast augmentation or a tummy tuck. Now that would have been a fun film!)There will be many more sent, etc...but don't forget the point --- that the Arnold model terminator is a ""dependable"", ""stronger"" model even if its older than the others send to do the job of terminating John Connor at various ages and stages in the game.Heck yes, I miss James Cameron's work, but I would have been disappointed if he went into this mire of Hollywood Franchise Business at this stage in his career. Same with Linda Hamilton. Onwards and upwards, I always say.Mr. Mostow has HIS chance now and he's done exactly what was needed of him. Studio execs are applauding.

On the other hand, the ending (like everyone else I wont give away) but for me, well worth the price I paid to get in this weekend to see it (and that was on a matinée.)Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines (Which by the way, is the best title since ""South Park - Bigger, Longer and Uncut"") is nothing more than some popcorn selling ""entertainment"" to kill a long drawn out holiday weekend and another, installment in ""the Life of John Connor, human savior.""",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

All the other movies had a shred of hope.  This one admits defeat.  Which is unfortunate.  I thought the movie was okay, it the 100 some minutes fly by.  But then again T3 is horribly short.  (with the t2 special edition running over 150 minutes long)There are some odd timeline mistakes.  John Conner is quoted as saying at the beginning they attacked him when he was 13.  Ouch.  Thats gotta hurt. If you watch T2 Robert Patricks keys John's name into the cop car's computer and it clearly states he was born in 1985.  And that he was 10 years old. Even on the disc 2 of T3 it says 1995.  So I assume that T3 takes place between 2005-2010.  Which doesn't seem like the time it's supposed to be in. And why use The Blue Man Group for the credit song.  Hey they are weird, but only on video.  So so as music.I was a bit peeved they had to kill Sarah Connor off.  There wasn't alot of reason to do this.  Musta been awfully young for what got her. 
Other pet peeves.  Whats up with coloring the Terminator's teeth?  They used to be the color of metal.  They are white now.  Alot of the future scenes were poorly done.  With horrible cgi fakery.  I like T1 and T2.  T3 is okay, but nowhere near the first two.  But probably a keeper.

116,DunnDeeDaGreat,Two words sum up this movie for me and they are popcorn flick,8,1 July 2003,"Moviegoing auidences have been waiting twelve years for Arnold Schwarzenegger to come back to the role that made him famous and the question remains; was it worth the wait? For me the answer is yes and no. First I'll focus on the yes part of the movie. Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines delivers it's share of action and special effects which in the summer time is why we go to the movies. Nick Stahl whose is  a very talented actor takes the role of John Connor from Edward Furlong and does it well. And the T-X played by the sexy Kristanna Loken is meancing and a smooth bad ass bad guy. Fianlnly Jonathan Mostow handles the action sequences very well in the film. The chase sequence in the film is one of the best I've seen from the three movies he's directed . Now let's focus on the no part of Terminator 3 that will upset many moviegoers. Terminator 3 has two main probelms that makes the film pale in comparison to it's precassadors. The first being the lack of storytelling that trio of screenwriters John Brancato,Michael Ferris and Tedi Sarafian can't seem to capture that Cameron magic which affects the direction of the talented Mostow. The second problem is the familar score by composer Brad Fiedel which is gone from this film. When it comes to the females in the film Claire Danes and Kristanna Loken both kinda gives a paper thin performances. Danes over does the damsel in distress role and Loken is nothing more than eye candy (but damn does she look good). The film won't please all tastes but if you want mindless entertainment then check this one out. Hopefully the inevitable Terminator 4 with Nick Stahl in the lead will be an improvement over this one. It's not that Terminator 3 is a bad film it just wasn't worth a 12 year wait.

John Conner is now a young adult. He now lives as a loner, and he made sure his identity and where abouts remained unknown. He thinks he and his mom prevented Judgement day, but he's wrong. The day the machines will take over is sooner than he expected.A new terminator the T-X appears out of nowhere. This time it resembles a young woman. Unlike the T-1000, the T-X is faster, stronger, smarter, and more knowledge than the original Terminator itself. In another area another begin comes back from the future, and you've guess it, another Terminator who is the same model as the previous 2.It was sent back to 2003 to protect John Conner again. John Conner must find a way to prevent Judgement Day from starting, if possible. With the T-X on his trail this will be a fight to the finish.Older Terminator fans might not like this one.

119,mentalcritic,Sinking as low in two hours as commercial television has in twenty-five years...,4,29 July 2003,"Arnold, I am able to remember way back in your career when many saw you as just another idiotic hero who couldn't speak intelligible English, a poor man's Sylvester Stallone, some called you. But your films appealed to me as a child for their raw violence, macho bravado, and the fact that in a supposed democracy, even a man whose only outstanding attribute was his biceps could make it big.Unfortunately, you seemed to forget something around the mid-1990s, namely that your primary audience was young men who loved nothing more than the thrill of seeing how hard you could hit an enemy, or how creatively you could come up with a smart remark after creatively dispatching him. Instead, you began pushing this choice-removing agenda and making your films as family-friendly or ham-fistedly political as possible. The 6th Day is a good example of this - I am one of the millions of people whose life could be substantially improved by the cloning of singular cells.Terminator 3 has me asking how much further you are going to turn your back on the things that made you a star. Few of the things done in this film to protect John Connor or Kate Brewster make any sense, and even fewer manage to satisfy the audience. Do you honestly think that not killing a singular person in this film somehow erases the ultra-conservative's stigma that you've killed more on-screen bad guys than any other actor in Hollywood?But to get away from knocking Arnold and his lack of respect for the audience mindest that made him one of the richest actors in Hollywood for a moment, he isn't the only one showing a profound lack of respect here. The screenwriters in this turkey quite obviously read half of the scripts for Terminators 1 and 2, then thought to themselves ""wheee, I can do that!"". Unfortunately, Confucious hit the nail on the head when he said that when you only read half of the sentence, you lose all the meaning. Terminators 1 and 2 were famous for pushing how far one could take violence in a film that is approved for teen viewing, but they also had a certain intelligence and moral to the story. Terminator 1 in particular showed us that even the most timid, seemingly useless person can rise to be a king (or rather queen) when given the right circumstances. Not because it is their destiny, or even because they are pushed in that direction, but because they have the good in them to make the right choice at the right time.Terminator 3 ditches everything the other two films told us about how our lives are not dictated or set to a script. Instead, we are told that Judgement Day is inevitable, and that we will kill ourselves for our own feelings of insecurity, no matter what. That's strike number one against the script. The next fatal error is to tell us that Skynet was no physical system at all, but rather a sentient program that is capable of writing its own digital virii to manipulate enemies to its will. Can you hear the screenwriting committee say ""hey, we need to make this story more MODERN, more NOW""? Remember when Madonna said that about the theme for Advertise Another Day, and what happened after that? Sometimes ""modern"" and ""good"" are two seperate things, guys.The third strike against Terminator 3 lies in the cinematography. Granted, it's a real challenge to be compared to James Cameron and the people he likes to work with in this department. After all, he is the only director who knows how to compose a scene on Super 35 negative that looks the same no matter what ratio you frame it in. But even directors who use Super 35 and quite apparently don't know how to do this, such as David Fincher, can make films that are more pleasant to look at than this. Doesn't anyone know yet that the thing that made Terminator 1 in particular shine was that sheer mayhem was going on in front of the camera (cars going through front walls for instance), but the camera stayed as still as an oak so that one could see exactly what was going on? Well, in Terminator 3, Jonathan Mostow resorts to the tactic of wobbling the camera to keep us confused as to what is going on during key action sequences. Put simply, this is not good enough.I won't get into all the continuity issues between this and the other two films in there series, but I will get into one issue. When Terminator 2 wrapped (and Arnold still had a career), James Cameron and Gale Anne Hurd called it the final chapter in the story. As in that's it, we won't be coming back to this again, we'd rather be CREATIVE. Well, fast forward ab out ten years, and Arnold's career is tanking because he has turned his back on what made him a star in the first place. So he goes to James Cameron and moans ""puh-lease writer another Terminator so I can keep making films"". Cameron told him where to go, but conveniently, Mostow stepped in and said ""yeah sure, we'll have a good time wiping our butts on the film that made you the big star you once were"".In short, to the writers of this pungent turd, I say shame on you for dragging cinema even further down into the ""dumbest buy the mostest"" philosophy that the summer blockbuster has been driven by for the last ten years (and yet they say ticket sales are slumping... gee, wonder why). To Arnold, I have the following to say. You are a sell-out, a hypocrite, and you are washed-up. You might call that statement cruel, but hopefully someone will read it to you and you will realise why the same people who made your career sparkle in the 1980s are turning their back on you. Until at least that happens, there is no hope for the intelligent action film. If Terminator 3 proves nothing else, it certainly proves that.On the plus side, however, it wasn't nearly as bad as the committee-butchered Alien 3 that made it into cinemas, but it does stand alongside it as an example of an unnecessary installment in a franchise being slung out to make a quick buck. Both of these films have received a very generous four out of ten from me.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

122,hnt_dnl,I enjoyed the highly underrated T3 more than T2!,9,2 May 2010,"I know hardcore T2 fans will call it blasphemy...but IMHO, 2003's TERMINATOR 3: RISE OF THE MACHINES (T3) is a more ENJOYABLE movie AND a BETTER film than T2! I re-watched T2 to get a handle on it's praise and conclude that it can ONLY be for the incredible special effects. T2 literally comes to a screeching halt for a good hour and that is one tedious hour filled with cheesy dialog, rambling, and pontification. And the plot of T2 is paper thin! Everything that happens feels staged. It is probably the least necessary film of the ""trilogy"".T3 follows a similar formula to T1 and T2 and again has the ""good"" Terminator, the T800 (Arnold Schwarzenegger in his last big film role before retiring from acting and going into politics) arrives in early 21st century LA. I'm glad to report that Arnie is SPOT ON in T3! Arnie is as iconic to the 80s and 90s as an action star as Clint Eastwood was to the 60s and 70s. Great to see the legend go out on a high note! Amazing that the past middle-aged man could light up the screen in a great action movie as well as he could 20 years earlier.Ironically, the T800's task this time is not to save John Connor, but to save Katherine ""Kate"" Brewster (played by Clare Danes in an underrated performance). Kate is John's future wife and a key member of the future rebellion against the machines. Danes in T3 reminds me a lot of Linda Hamilton from T1, a sweet, vulnerable character with an unexplored inner toughness.The evil Terminator this time is the highly advanced TX (played excellently by the incredible-looking Kristanna Loken; that's right, a Terminatrix!). The TX can not only take the form of people she comes in contact with (like T1000 in T2), but also she is equipped with a weapons arsenal that is able to do damage to Arnie's more obsolete T800. I don't know what movie the naysayers of this film were watching, but Loken is out and out terrific in this role and not once did I think she was anything but a machine (albeit a sexy looking one!). And I think that her performance is lot more attributable to Loken over the CGI, whereas a great amount of Robert Patrick's role in T2 was DUE to CGI.Never fear, because John Connor is in this, too! John is roaming LA as a vagrant (taking odd jobs to survive) to conceal his identity from any more Terminators that may come to find him. John's introduction in T3 is rather unsettling as it appears he has lost all hope and may be ready to end it all. John is played superbly by Nick Stahl, in a truly under-appreciated performance. Stahl delivers a very subtle, nuanced performance. I found his actions and reactions to be authentic. Also, Stahl ACTUALLY looks like he could be the product of Michael Biehn and Linda Hamilton from T1, resembling both actors, which adds to the authenticity of his character; you can actually see parts of both Reese and Sarah from T1 in Stahl's John! Stahl is the glue that holds T3 together for me.The Terminators arrive at the same time as John at Kate's vet clinic and the T800 saves John and Kate from the TX, then a chase ensues. T3 is very similar to T1 in that it's tone is fast-paced and bleak. I'm not putting T3 on the same level as T1! T3 is a bit closer to the modern action movie than the sleeper low budget art film that T1 turned out to be, but it has a lot of heart, just like T1 had.Being a sequel, it borrows situations from T1 and T2, like the obligatory opening scene of Arnie confronting yet another ""lowlife"" to acquire clothing. But I was amazed at how deftly this, and many other, scenes were handled. The director Jonathan Mostow did a great job of generating wit and humor from cliché situations, mostly due to the efforts of the deadpan Schwarzenegger.T3 seems like less of an ""epic"" film than T2, which I don't think a bad thing, and is amazingly short for a modern day Hollywood summer movie. The way that Doomsday approaches and the machines take over is a tad spotty for me, but the ending of T3 is one of the better, most provocative ones I've seen in a movie in YEARS and actually serves as a fitting end to the franchise (of course there are more sequels out there!).Last but not least, T3 has some GREAT action scenes! The early big chase scene where the advanced TX operates all those vehicles in unison is a contender for BEST action sequence of the decade! The climactic scenes, including the big showdown between the T800 and the TX, are pulse-poundingly good! The feasibility of T3's action scenes stem from real stunts/effects and limited, spare use of CGI.Again, I think the characters are easy to root for in this. Stahl and Danes give John and Kate a pleasant innocence yet underlying toughness and evolve convincingly during the film and prove to be worthy to hold the mantle of saviors of the human race. And Loken, if a bit sexed up in this film, is quite convincing as a robot. Believe me, this could have EASILY been a laughable performance and she is surprisingly MORE THAN GOOD. Finally, the legendary Mr. Schwarzenegger proves that he could still handle an action film in his final acting days!The fact that James Cameron didn't direct this is a plus as far as I'm concerned. I think most of his movies after T1 are immensely overrated. He's not the best storyteller and T2 was proof of that. In the end, T3 is an excellent action movie worthy of being part of the Terminator franchise...My two cents!",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
123,hall895,Most pointless sequel ever?,5,23 August 2011,"They just couldn't leave well enough alone could they? Most everyone enjoyed the first two Terminator films. And most everyone was probably satisfied with the way the story wrapped up at the end of T2. The Terminator story had been told. It was over. But Hollywood can never resist an easy money-grab so after 12 years of allowing the franchise to rest in peace we got T3. And the movie inevitably made obscene amounts of money so the accountants were happy. The fans? Not so happy. If you liked the first two movies the joke's on you. Not only is T3 a rather lousy movie but it also makes the first two movies, the ones people actually liked, completely irrelevant. All that stuff about stopping the machines, changing the future, determining your own fate? Forget all that. The future is inevitable. What's going to happen is going to happen. So none of this really matters. If that's the case why am I watching these movies in the first place? James Cameron had the good sense to stay away from this turkey. Linda Hamilton too. If only Arnold Schwarzenegger had resisted the lure of a giant paycheck we could have been spared the absurdity that is this movie. But alas Arnold went for the cash, Terminator legacy be damned. So we got this pointless, unnecessary, quite terrible sequel which cheapens the whole Terminator saga. Another Terminator gets sent back in time, John Connor starts running for his life, Arnold shows up to protect him and a bunch of things get blown up. The end. Story? What story? Who can be bothered with trifling things like a story when we can just blow out the budget on an interminable crane chase? The evil Terminator this time comes in the form of Kristanna Loken, a hot blond chick. This is likely in the hopes that the sight of a hot blond chick will distract teenage fanboys from the fact that the movie stinks. With Hamilton missing we need a new damsel in distress so we get a woefully out of her element Claire Danes. An action movie star she is most certainly not. John Connor is this time played by Nick Stahl, probably an improvement over T2's Edward Furlong. So at least there's one thing about this movie better than the last one. Not nearly enough to make up for the multitude of things which are much, much worse. Like Arnold's Terminator for example who just bounces from one pathetic attempt at an ""Hasta la vista, baby"" style catchphrase to another. I think somewhere along the way somebody got confused and thought they were writing a comedy. A comedic Terminator, yes that's what the world wants. Have these people no sense at all? Did Arnold not read this script and realize he was destroying the memory of his most iconic character? Or did he realize it and just not care as long as the studio's check cleared? The film's final insult comes with the ending which is no ending at all. The filmmakers have no resolution to their story, just a setup for another movie to come. So they rendered the story of the first two films meaningless and couldn't even bother to have any story of their own. Gee, thanks. So glad I paid money to watch this utterly pointless movie. The future is inevitable and that future apparently includes lousy Terminator movies.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
124,MrGKB,A worthy continuation of the Apocalypse,6,8 July 2003,"I was fully expecting to be disappointed with this film, especially after what I considered the existential failure of ""The Matrix: Reloaded,"" earlier this year. Pleasantly, I was not. Any movie that starts off with a nuclear bang is okay in my book, and things picked up nicely thereafter.Arnold does the thing he does best (laconic one-liners), Nick Stahl is a suitable replacement for Ed Furlong (mostly due to decent acting chops and a certain resemblance to Michael Biehn), the effects are pretty much flawless, the chase sequences rock, the Terminatrix is a satisfying upgrade from the T-1000, and the ending is not only a darkly enjoyable conclusion to the (relatively thin) plot (which is pretty much a retread of ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" minus Sarah Connor), it leaves things nicely open-ended for yet another sequel. I left the theater feeling that I got my money's worth; what more can you ask?My only complaints would center on the script's reliance on a number of coincidences that raise the eyebrow of believability (including the otherwise enjoyable cameo appearance of Dr. Silverman), and what I felt was the miscasting of Claire Danes. I'm not sure why I felt that way, as I consider her to be a gifted actor, but she just rubbed me the wrong way. I suppose repeated viewings will soften my opinion, perhaps. (3/10/07 edit: I just learned that Sophia ""The Hitcher"" Bush was originally cast in Danes' role, but was let go shortly after production began because the director felt she was too young. One can only wonder how this film would have fared thus cast...) Nutshell opinion: T3 moves the franchise forward with workmanlike style and panache, and leaves the viewer anticipating the next chapter. My hope is that when ""T4"" rolls around, we get to see Arnold playing the human being upon whom his Terminator was modeled.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
125,vip_ebriega,Men and their 'Machines'.,6,13 July 2008,"My Take: Lacks the originality of the first or the thrills of the second, but effective all the same. Third chapters are usually gamble, especially if you have a series that's as successful as the TERMINATOR saga. What started as a hit low-budget sci-fi thriller (in THE TERMINATOR) turns into one of the most explosive and expensive blockbuster of all time (in TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY). So what is there in store for audiences in TERMINATOR 3: RISE OF THE MACHINES. Not to terribly much I'm afraid, as the film falls under the category of ""been-there-done-that"" for most of the scenes. Director James Cameron unfortunately leaves further involvement in this third film, and leaves the directorial reigns (as well much of the TERMINATOR legacy) to action director Jonathan Mostow, who isn't exactly a brand name a director. The new story (helmed by new batch of writers who are everything but James Cameron and Gale Ann Hurd).But regardless of its shortcomings, TERMINATOR 3 isn't a total loss as it might have turned out. While he rushes the screenplay for production, Mostow does offer a nicely done batch of action sequences and nifty special effects to keep one busy. There's much action here to satisfy the conventional action fan, be it chase scenes or wild gun-play action (maybe even both in one scene). Arnold Schwarzenegger (before running for governor of California) returns as the ever-present emotionless futuristic cyborg once again sent to protect John Conner (Nick Stahl), now a messed-up drifter, from yet another mechanical creation from Skynet sent to the past to kill him. For a change (whilst not much), the new machine, called the T-X, is takes the form of a chick (played by Kristanna Loken), which is just as unstoppable as its predecessor, other than that there's very little else new nor interestingly unique about this new killing machine. In addition, the big bad machine from the violent future must also protect Conner's would be wife (played by Claire Danes). Their connections with each other? They were classmates once! It doesn't get much more complicated than that, now does it? While the writing leaves much to be desired, and its anticlimax of an ending (of an anticlimax of a sequel by the way!) leaves us wondering why we had to go through the events of this film in the first place. One more thing, the much beloved characters of the ass-kicking woman warrior Sarah Conner is sorrily missed, almost as much as a payoff to the character of John Conner, who is a disappointment here in this film. Still, nonetheless, TERMINATOR 3 is a decent action thriller, packed with action and thrills. Leave our cynicism and brains at the door, it's brainless summer season again, and TERMINATOR 3 is a decent effort of pure mainstream film-making. It's disappointing, but only as sequel.Rating: *** out of 5.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
126,fmarkland32,Saving face...,6,4 September 2006,"Arnold Schwarzenegger returns as the T-800, this time sent back to take on a far superior model that is programmed to destroy other terminators, however also the fact remains that destroying the data and chips merely postponed judgment day and John Connor (Nick Stahl who replaces Edward Furlong) tries to follow in his mother's footsteps in preventing the war but finds his attempts are futile. Also there is Claire Danes who is also targeted with Connor for termination and who will also grow up to be his wife. Terminator 3 can be seen as somewhat of a comeback for Arnold after witnessing what could possibly be the longest slump of an actor's career. After True Lies, Arnold made what has to be some of the lamest action flicks of his career (And that isn't even counting his embarrassing ventures into comedy and the Batman franchise) Terminator 3 can be seen as a comeback as it is superior to everything he's made since Terminator 2 but generally inferior to everything before. (Let alone the first two of the series) One peak at the title and one is somewhat shocked at the negative emotions regarding this film, a glance at IMDb's forum labels this to come up every now and then as Arnold's worst flick. (Let's not even get into the fact The Terminator and Commando fall behind Eraser and End Of Days in the best category (Shudder)) but this is not the case and Terminator 3 holds up fairly well in the story department which is handled very well. The action sequences are also exciting and Arnold is in good form. The main flaw is the new villain who just isn't as imposing as Robert Patrick or Arnold Schwarzenegger from the original. The novel touch here is that the machine is a female but clearly she doesn't do anything the T-1000 didn't do and even though Loken is adequate, it becomes obvious that she couldn't really hold her own against Arnold. Also the return of Earl Boen (The holdover from the first two movies) is wasted and is basically forgotten soon. Indeed the whole movie feels rushed and seems to indicate that the pace is quick because the director is on a deadline. Indeed usually you want movies to be shortened but for once I would have liked to see it longer so I could have found out more about some key moments which aren't developed due to the main plot. In other words Cameron could make a movie compact and complex. Jonathan Mostow can only make the movie compact and although Terminator 3 is worth watching for the genre fan, it goes without saying that it doesn't hold up when compared to the first two. Which is of course a given.* *1/2 out of 4-(Pretty good)",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
127,one9eighty,He should have considered not coming back,6,12 February 2020,"In the grand scheme of Terminator films, this is the poor relation. It's been panned on various reviewing websites, and to some extent I can see why too - but I don't hate it, in fact if you give it a chance it's actually alright. In this film a new Terminator (T-X) is sent back in time to the past (our present) to complete another mission which will change its present (our future) and bring machines the victory in a war waged against humanity which has been blazing for a long time. John Connor is all grown up and living off the grid so he can't be hunted. While he isn't the intended target this time, he still manages to find himself on the run from the new super advanced T-X Terminator. Teaming up with his future wife Katherine Brewster, he is on his own mission to survive the conflict with the T-X, and to try and prevent the future from happening thus saving humanity.Some would argue this film raises more issues than it does solve them, but given the chance, and ignoring the numerous issues, this is a decent action film - not brilliant, just decent. The first Terminator film shows what imagination and storytelling, despite having a low budget , can do - a masterpiece. T2 shows what a big budget and a good imagination, despite only a decent story can achieve - another stroke of genius. T3 unfortunately, shows what a big budget but very little imagination and story can achieve - which ultimately doesn't get it to the heights of its two predecessors.There are times were it tries to give nods to previous films in the franchise, but in doing it once to many throughout the film it becomes a bit of a parody of itself. The cast in the film is decent enough, Arnie looks a little over aged for his role, but who else can you put in that role. Nick Stahl and Claire Danes do alright as the central humans in the film, but poor scripting means there isn't a massive amount to write home about. Kristanna Loken is a bit cartoony as the new terminator, which I'm not sure if it's down to an overuse of CGI on her - but still she is decent enough.Some of the issues I had included: T800's aren't supposed to be able to learn, yet Arnie's Terminator has learned plenty of new things. How is Skynet operational after John destroyed the core and every trace of previous Terminators. If Skynet can send Terminators back in time, as it has done plenty of times now (5 by my count), why not send an army of them back in time so that they can win this time? Why haven't the US Military got any security at its top secret facility, and more to the point, how can two young adults and their 6ft gun totting robot enter the facility without being accosted? I have plenty more issues, but I getting fed of myself whinging now.I enjoyed the twist at the end of this film more than I did the journey to get to that point, I enjoyed looking at some of the version 1 killing machines, I enjoyed the nostalgia this film brought. The biggest issue I had though is that this lacked balls, it didn't have attitude, it didn't feel right. I felt like a film for films sake, rather than a film for a great concept. Perhaps this got panned so much because of the great Terminator films which came before it. At best, for me, this is a 6 out of 10.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
128,CitizenCaine,Rise Of The Machines=Lots Of Action,7,4 October 2003,"The third installment in the Terminator series is the weakest, but still entertaining. It's very difficult for the second movie in a series to be as good as the first one, much less the third movie. Alien 3 is an example, as well as Alien Resurrection. Both were far weaker than Alien and Aliens, and so it is with this movie. Schwarzenegger is back as the protective robot, facing a female terminatrix: Kristanna Loken. Neither part requires great acting, other than maintaining the same dementia-like affect throughout the film. Schwarzenegger is satisfactory in his role; this time around he becomes a source of most of the film's humor, spouting a succession of tag-lines, each one funnier than the previous one. Some of them poke fun at his lines from the previous movies. However, the ""talk to the hand"" bit seems way out of character, and seems designed to break up the target demographic more than anything else. Loken is one of many young hottie actresses that are displaying high octane girl power these days. However, she is not nearly as compelling as Robert Patrick was in T2. The reason has more to do with the script than anything else. The movie consists of one action sequence and/or long chase scene after another. The bridging story line scenes verbalize the character relationships rather than allowing them to develop. Nick Stahl and Claire Danes add little in their roles and they could have been played by any other actors with little difference. The ending offers a significant twist, and the hope for yet another sequel. The highlights of the movie are the action scenes, which are ferocious. The best scene involves a chase with an overhead crane vehicle, driven by Loken, pursuing Stahl and Danes in a pickup truck, with Schwarzenegger trying to intervene. A bathroom fight scene, between Schwarzenegger and Loken, is a close second. If the story and supporting characters were stronger, this would be on par with the first two movies. However, there are many movies that consist of weak stories and characters overloaded with great action that are still entertaining enough; this is one such movie. *** of 4 stars.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
129,Stampsfightclub,Overblown action yet story carries it till the end,5,4 April 2010,"A TX (Loken) machine from the future is sent back in time to assassinate John Connor (Stahl) in a bid to wipe out human kind's chance of survival.12 years had passed between the crowd pleasing sequel Judgement Day and the release of this 3rd part and at a time of technical revolution, that prevailed over story in this disappointing if still watchable sequel.The Matrix had broken minds, Lord of the Rings was epic swiping Oscars for all departments and such, the science fiction genre itself was a stepping stone tester for digital effects which this film justifies right from the off.As the previous films started with two naked men appearing in an electrical storm this film uses the same effect with a stunningly blank Kristanna Loken and the usual coolness of Arnie. Before this there is a reasonable opening as Nick Stahl's John Connor, a depiction of insecurity and hurried decisions, sets the game straight for us that had forgotten. The Terminator had tried to kill Sarah Connor in 1984 before remerging years later to terminate John Connor himself. Arnie, again the good robot, is programmed to protect John Connor and new character and significant protagonist of the future Kate Brewster (a fairly composed character from Claire Danes) The story moves along with its futuristic ethics and mythology that were used in the previous two films, though without the conviction and importance Cameron laid down so easily, and his presence, and lack of it, is certainly profound here.Every term spoken by the T101 feels action orientated with a heavy weight. He burdens everything with a macho ideology whilst the camera shoots him in a hero motive. There isn't a free flowing spontaneity about the terminator, which is a dreadful shame.The opening stages of Connor laying the current situation down are good, giving the film a dramatic implication as he reveals his loneliness and depression over the lack of happenings since the postponement of judgement day. The scene on the bike with the animal in the road was well shot, very simple and capturing the feeling of bad luck perfectly.But after that director Jonathan Mostow simply over indulges the film with a hyperbole of action sequences that would never ever happen in their presentation of realism. The big truck (trying to capitalise on good technique from previous films) sequence is so over blown and unnecessary whilst the final sequences and scenes in Skynet are all perfect timing and minimal chances have an alternative action orientated drivel.As Terminator Salvation showed as well the science fiction genre has become fixated with special effects rather than using the plot to the advantage of the story, which this justifies. Whilst the essence of the terminator origins sees this one through there is little salvation in that this is not a match for the previous two releases.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

131,stamper,"With the creator of the series gone, what is left of an epic story",8,1 September 2003,"Many people, including I were very doubtful Terminator 3 would amount to anything, after the departure of James Cameron from the project. Other blows for fans of the series were that neither Edward Furlong nor Linda Hamilton would show up for the sequel and that not even William Wisher (who co-wrote both of the previous films wrote anything for this one). Instead the writers were people of little fame and the  director was not too famous as well, only having had a small hit' called U-571 in the year 2000 (grossing over 100 Million Dollars world-wide). The only comfort for the doubtful (such as I), was that Mario Kassar (producer of T2) and Gale Anne Hurd (producer and co-creator of The Terminator and producer of T2) were attached to the project as producers. It took a quite a time to cast T3 and it left me with mixed feelings. First it was said that Famke Janssen (the best Bond-girl ever) was to play the TerminatriX, but she turned it down. Then Edward Furlong was not going to be present as John Connor. By then I'd given up hope, that this could ever work. Then they cast Nick Stahl, who I extremely liked in Bully, as the new' John Connor and Claire Danes (of Romeo + Juliet fame) was cast as well. This looked more promising, but sold I wasn't. The trailer came along and I liked it pretty much, but still I stayed away from the big cinema and awaited the Terminators arrival at our local cinema. When he came I went, and when I left, I left satisfied.
Terminator 3 starts out with a great spoken intro by John Connor and then delves deeply into matter with which all Terminator fans are well accustomed too: Terminators arriving on earth after being sent back in time, desperately in the need of clothes. This is what all Terminator films start with and this though this one does so with a different type of approach. In the first part of the film, Arnold Schwarzenegger delivers a good one-liner after another and the action scenes are predominant (as they remain for the bigger part of the film). The one-liners are not always funny because of what is said, but because of the way it is said in and the facial expression Arnold makes when he utters the remarks. The action scenes are enormous and nothing short of spectacular (which is something I do not say easily, since I've seen a lot of action on film). This, along with some surprises in the story, are what keeps you on the edge of you seat for the ride and the only thing that could be considered drawback in this film, is the fact that the action sequences are too dominant at times.
But what about the times, when there are no action scenes? What about the acting? Well, Arnie was as good as ever in his role as the almost indestructible Terminator (although his last few lines were corny and almost overshadowed his entire performance). Claire Danes did an ok job and Nick Stahl was adequate as the new John Connor. Kristina Loken was ok as the T-X, but at times I felt that more could have done with her. Maybe they could have made more use of her looks and maybe they could have made her act a little less than the T-1000 (Robert Patrick) in T2. But hey, if everything was good, that would be the perfect scenario and hence, the perfect film! Whenever did you see that one?
Another drawback of the film manifests itself toward the end. There seems to be a desperate attempt by the makers of the film, to make Arnold say some memorable lines as he did in The Terminator and T2. I hate to say it, but they fall flat and almost ruin the ending. I said almost! Because when you think almost everything is done and the rest of the story is obvious, there is one surprise left for John and Kate (Claire Danes) and this is, what makes the film really worth while. Those last seven minutes or so, when John and Kate are on their own and when once again, there is a spoken part. That part only (together with the spoken intro) is worth the price admission. Really well done! The finishing touch comes with Brad Fiedel's theme, which I so dearly missed in the beginning of the film. Why oh why did they not play it at the beginning as well??? All in all this is good effort and the slightly worse' rating in comparison to The Terminator and T2 only stems from Arnold's last one-liners and the fact that this was more of a summer popcorn flick than were the other two.

After sending a Terminator back in time to kill John Connor's mother in the fist movie, then a T-1000 to kill a teenage John in the sequel, now the time-traveling cyborg assassin is a T-X (Kristanna Loken), targeting twenty-something John (Nick Stahl) and his future wife (Claire Danes). *Of course* the rebels send back another android (Schwarzenegger) to stop the T-X.Terminator 3 lacks tension, mostly because of the weak villain. Loken, with her supermodel looks, is utterly wrong for the part, as she tries and fails to mimic Robert Patrick's superb performance in the previous film. Patrick, with his glacial stare and sinister body language, conveyed a deep sense of menace. Loken is terrible - her stiff walk, the comical way she tilts her head... it's a vapid, inane performance. The only mildly clever use of the new female terminator is a five-second scene where she looks at a lingerie advertisement and inflates her bust to a bigger size; it took the android only a quick glance to understand how to be more persuasive in our sexist society.Stahl is a better actor than Furlong in Terminator 2, but writing in his scenes with Danes is cringe-inducing. Ahnold is Ahnold.Plot is nonsensical and contradicts the whole point of the previous movies. So, is Judgement Day inevitable or not? Future *can* be altered, but only in plot-convenient ways? Sorry, time travel stories require a little more thought than that.All would be forgiven if this boasted magnificent action, but director Mostow, who made the decent submarine flick U-571, doesn't deliver anything memorable.

133,The_Movie_Cat,"""I'll be cack.""",5,6 March 2004,"WARNING: REVIEW CONTAINS MINOR SPOILERS
Nah, I'm only kidding, this second Terminator sequel isn't actually that bad to be honest. That said, I have only seen it the once, and can't imagine its thin-even-by-Terminator-standards plot really holding my attention a second time.The original still holds its place as a quite impressive arthouse SF thriller in my opinion. Judgement Day? Well, it depends on how I view it - sometimes it's an overlong moronfest, others it's an exciting FX extravaganza and others it's a soulless, noisy popcorn machine. Certainly the day I posted my review of it to the IMDb I wasn't looking on favourably, though it's clearly superior to this pedestrian follow-up.What plot T3 does have (and with its subtitle ""Rise of the Machines"" it could arguably be taken to court under the Trading Standards Agreement) seems to be dividing into two unequal halves. Remember those really corny episodes of Knight Rider (okay, all episodes of Knight Rider were really corny, but roll with me) where an evil KITT known as KARR would control Michael Knight's vehicle and turn it against him? Michael would have to stand there arguing with KITT's sense of reason? Even back in the days of David Hasselhoff's 80s perm that was dated, but here we have similar shenanigans with Arnie's battered T-101 under the control of the TX. The other, much larger, half comes directly from a straight rehash of Judgement Day.Unfortunately, this does get rather silly as it means that while the film delivers a reasonable twist, it does yet again contradict itself. The nuclear war will come... no it won't... yes it does. Though this development makes the phrase ""I am"" possibly the most predictable in cinema history, the nuclear explosions are made to look quite beautiful. Whether this is a good thing or not is open to debate, and maybe with a bit of post 9/11 angst this would have made the film feel relevant, rather than just an old relic trying to relive glory days.Of course, the biggest problem making this an okay sequel instead of one you actually give a toss about is the TX. When a character is so rigidly defined by their sexuality as Kristanna Loken is, then it removes all tension. It's just not possible to be scared when your libido is being forced to work, and even by T2's standards there's an enormous amount of obvious humour, pushing it beyond parody at times. Okay, I did shame myself by laughing at the gay gag, but when it gets to the stage of the TX checking her reflection and squeezing Arnie's balls it's just gone too far. And with her superpowers there to attempt to top Robert Patrick's superb T-1000, we get silliness like her power over other machines and inflatable breasts. If the inevitable fourth film continues to build on this we'll soon have flying Terminators that can assume the form of small rodents.An okayish script is often dumb, allowing for back-slapping cameos by Dr. Silberman, and a nauseating plane scene where Clare Danes contrivedly explains how she used to test fly her brother's. Generally though, while there's the traditional reams of exposition in between pointless explosions, this isn't so contrived, and even offers up intriguing possibilities with the foretold death of John Connor. Commendably, even the paradoxes inherent in the concept are addressed, with Connor (Nick Stahl, quite good) reasoning that their actions may make the T-101 cease to exist.If I really wanted to be nit-picky I could cite the incredibly crude uses of product placement, but instead I'll just ask the question of what new does this sequel bring to the party? The answer is nothing. There is no real reason for this sequel to exist, though it is nice to see Arnie having another hit, when his lower-key successes of late have all been worthwhile (though The 6th Day was a stinker).The lack of usage of the theme and that eerie android sound effect surprise, yet the FX are, naturally, technically the most proficient. However, Jonathan Mostow's leaden direction fails to work them in any innovative way (and why do the Terminators now arrive in a disco mirrorball?), meaning they fail to impress. Combine this with the fact that such effects are no longer groundbreaking, as they were for T2, and it's something of a let-down.

Even Arnold Schwarzenegger,the man we have come to know and love as the T100,doesn't quite seem the same anymore.The computer generated special effects are just a little too obvious for my taste,and the entire film takes on the feel of a small,made for cable,or straight to video dud instead of a big screen blockbuster.I don't watch very many sequels, because they all too often disappoint me and ruin my memory of the previous film.I thought,in this case that since the second film surpassed the first in terms of quality viewing,that this third installment would at least measure up to one of those two.Much to my dismay,I was wrong.If this film could not have been directed by Cameron, it should have been given to someone on the same class as him,such as Ridley Scott.Perhaps it would have stood a better chance of being good.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
135,fernandoschiavi,"""T3"" represents a clear drop in the series' quality standard, since, despite having good action sequences, it gets complicated whenever the script tries to develop the story",7,22 May 2020,"Twelve years after the release of the classic second film in the franchise, a new adaptation would continue with the main plot after a change in the rights to the franchise. In her divorce from James Cameron, Linda Hamilton asked for the rights to the ""Terminator"" franchise, which she then resold to Mario Kassar and Andrew Vajna of the bankrupt Carolco. The duo's new company, C2 Pictures, financed this third film, causing confusion and at the same time expecting fans, as ""The Final Judgment"" was planned to end the story started in the first film. The story even ends with this idea, since Cyberdine (the company where Skynet would be developed) and all the evidence that could lead to new research to develop an intelligent and independent computer system had been exterminated. Curiosity was how the story would be conceived.Directed by Jonathan Mostow and with only two actors returning, Schwarzenegger and Earl Boen - who makes a brief appearance as Dr. Silberman - the story of the third film takes place ten years after ""The Final Judgment"", with John Connor (Nick Stahl) living nomadically after his mother's death from leukemia, and two exterminators being sent to the past, one to protect John and his future wife Kate Brewster (Claire Danes) and the other to kill future members of human resistance.Even with good ideas in the action part, the script by John Brancato and Michael Ferris manages to continue the plot of the second film, but it misses by discarding some pillars of the series and by bringing unforgivable holes that take the unit from the series as a whole. The temporal comings and goings always leave immense holes in the best of cinematic fiction scripts. In the case of ""Terminator 3"", there are striking discrepancies. One is especially in relation to the Schwarzenegger Exterminator. After transforming itself into a complex and moving figure in the previous film, the T-800 (now T-850) becomes a mere accessory in this third part, practically becoming an adjunct. There is no sign of chemistry and the dynamic relationship between the cyborg and his protégés here - but that is justified because it is a new model. However, the Exterminator acts in a contradictory way: at a certain moment, for example, he clarifies that it is not the same android seen previously, but just another example of the same line (something logical): however, he avoids killing humans and, in a certain scene, opens the hood of a car to look for the keys to the vehicle - two things he had learned in the second film.In contrast, Kristanna Loken has little impact like Terminatrix: although she has far more resources than previous villains (being able to access the Internet, perform DNA tests and turn her arms into powerful weapons), the cyborg does not act with the same determination unforgiving of the T-1000. The beautiful actress just does what is expected for this type of character and never really threatens the lives of the heroes. Initially, the difference in the plot consists of the mission of T-X, which includes the murder of all the human resistance generals of the future. However, a casual encounter with Connor and Kate Brewster, his future wife, will cause her to pursue him for the duration of the tape.However, the story of how John Connor has been living in recent years, especially after his mother's death, is an idea that works: traumatized and depressed, the boy is a fascinating character, since the weight of his destiny (and the glory associated with your future leadership) simply prevents you from enjoying the present. He must carry the weight of being someone he is not yet; he must live waiting for his destiny to come true, contenting himself with the mediocrity of anonymity while the future does not arrive. And what is most painful: in order to fulfill his glorious destiny, John must witness the end of the world, which is still a tragic irony of destiny. The subject is, in short, the anxious and sad veteran that his mother was in the previous film - and therein lies the main strength of this new chapter.Jonathan Mostow is able to present a typical product for large audiences, with a lot of action, electrifying sequences and moments of adrenaline, which leave the viewer unable to breathe, highlighting the chase scenes involving a crane, a fire brigade truck and a car, in addition to the escape from the cemetery where Sarah Connor's tomb was located and, obviously, the entire final sequence inside the government facility where the rebellion of the machines commanded by Skynet against humanity would take place. Still, it is still unfortunate that the best sequence is the chase that takes place at the beginning of the story, since the rest of the projection can never match up in rhythm or tension.
The director manages to recreate this beaten universe with a correct development - there are repetitions within the film itself, such as the two car chases (the first had already become so good, what for a second?) - and good doses of humor (good to know how to laugh) of himself, with quotes and references to previous episodes, such as the T-800 glasses joke at the beginning of the film and the appearance of Dr. Silberman's character, who took care of Sarah Connor in Terminator 2: The Final Judgment (1992) and that makes a small participation this time trying to comfort the young lady), in addition to managing to develop a bold but controversial ending. In general, the script brought the addition of new information about the apocalyptic future of Earth is also welcome, opening up new possibilities for the future of the series, even if contrary to the ideas presented previously.""Terminator 3"" represents a clear drop in the series' quality standard, since, despite having good action sequences, it gets complicated whenever the script tries to develop the story. This time the T-800 played by Schwarzenegger must protect not only John Connor, but also a certain Katherine Brewster. The reason? She will be Connor's wife and the couple's children 'will be important'. Now, if the leader of humans in the future had already defeated machines, what importance ('historically' speaking) could their children have? And if he has not yet won the revolution, how can his descendants matter to the future if they are still only children? The answer is obvious: this was just an excuse found by the writers to involve Danes' character in the plot and present it as the hero's romantic interest.So far, so good: despite being mediocre, the ""revelation"" does not compromise the logic of previous films. Unfortunately, however, T3 does not stop there and ends up introducing a series of new concepts regarding Skynet that radically contradict the main elements of the first two chapters - and this is inexcusable, since, in retrospect, it ends up harming its predecessors (for that we should care about the efforts made by Sarah, John and the Exterminator to destroy the Cyberdine building, in ""The Terminator 2"", if we now know that their actions are useless and wrong?). It is also regrettable to see the philosophy of the first two chapters ('There is no destiny - except what we do') being discarded in favor of a vision of ""predestination"", of the inevitability of events, as this, once again, takes us to see the actions of the brave Sarah Connor as a simple waste of sweat. And this is the biggest sin in the third film.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
136,Angry_Arguer,Dense and Denser,1,6 July 2003,"The 'Terminator' series has always had its plot going against it.  Time travel is finicky business and, unfortunately, 'Terminator 3' takes an already convoluted and mixed-up time plot and changes it around.Instead of a fairly well planned plot, we get a mixture of ""Terminator 2"" with ""The Fast and the Furious"".  There really isn't anyway they can top the previous movies without going overboard in one department and lagging in more critical ones.  T2 proved that.  How many different ways can they make the same car chase?Jonathan Mostow is competent as a director, but he lacks James Cameron's legendary touch.  ""B-o-o-h-o-o.""

138,TheNorthernMonkee,A generally good action flick,6,5 August 2003,"POTENTIAL SPOILERSWhilst the 1st Terminator was a dark subtle matter (and admittedly my favourite of the three), the 2nd moved onto a more mainstream easy watching platform. This film continues on from number 2 & doesn't disappoint.Whilst admittedly it has none of the major thought processes that I'm usually keen on. There's something amazing about just being able to watch Arnie driving around beating people up again.Truth be told, the only thing I have a flaw with this film, and I'm probably the only one, is the T-X. I can't help but feel that whilst Loken (is that the proper spelling of her name?) makes a fair effort, I just can't take her seriously as a threat to mankind. I just feel with a better choice in outfit & without hair tied back in a way which makes her look like she should be wearing a suit in an office somewhere, would have made her more of a threat. In the end of the day though, this just feels like some sort of equal rights idea. It makes me wonder what will happen in Terminator 4 (and there WILL be another). Will they try & combine the first type of Terminator with Arnie's type & create some sort of Terminator Paverotti? Could even create a Terminator Dog or something. Despite all my negatives regarding Loken however, the same concerns were probably made about Patrick's T1000 in Terminator 2. Despite the occasional concerns though, this is still an entertaining film. So back to the cinema for a 2nd viewing I go. Go Arnie Go!",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
139,grahamsj3,Ho-hum,6,13 January 2004,"The Terminator series went one film too far and this was that film. This film lacks the cohesion that it's older brethren had. The acting is so-so, the plot boringly similar to the other two. The film has plenty of action, as all the Terminators do, but other than that, it's just not a keeper. Hopefully no one will resurrect this series when Gov. Arnold is finished saving California. This series should be TERMINATED!",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
140,kuarinofu,The beginning of the end,5,18 February 2020,"Re-watching this film in 2020 after all the sequels and re-quels makes so much more sense since it gives you a clear picture of when and where it all started. I'm talking about the parasitism of the Terminator franchise.Obviously, every film after the first one is the same exact film, yet if Terminator 2 was a superior big-budget refined version of the first one, every other film after it was just a lesser version of T2 (except for Salvation, which was a slightly different take but still bad).Interestingly enough, when I watched Genisys in the theatre I thought that this idea of re-shooting the classic ones frame-by-frame is just a sign of creative bankruptcy that the franchise has come to.Then Dark Fate came out, and it was exactly the same film as T2 scene-by-scene with different backdrops and CGI. There was little to no original content in that. I have a detailed review of the Dark Fate as well.And now, after re-watching Rise of the Machines, the picture is finally clear in my mind. The franchise was never supposed to live past T2, the story was over, and this film shows it.Rise of the Machines is a cheesy badly written rehash of T2 with horrible CGI that was never good and doesn't hold up in 2020.There are some redeeming factors like the insane car chase with actual physical stunts which looks great even in 2020, and the ending was surprisingly good for a horribly written story like this.And of course, Arnie was great to look at, even though his character is a comically large dumb robot, which is what our beloved Terminator has become after this film in all the sequels that feature real Arnie, both Genisys, and Dark Fate made him a joke as well.There should have never been a T2 sequel.

It's a pacey but rather soulless film, indifferently acted and with poorly conceived characters. Some tension is generated by female Terminator Kristanna Loken's first attack, but even this just descends into formula after a while. We've been here before in the earlier movies, and they did it a lot better.What the film really misses is James Cameron's ultra-smart direction and sassy grasp of narrative. I'll be honest and say I don't care much for Titanic and Avatar but his two Terminator movies, Aliens, and The Abyss are much admired genre classics. Johnathon Mostow's effort, in the end, does not join them.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
142,Superunknovvn,"Good, but not worthy of the Terminator franchise (including nerdy rant & SPOILERS)",6,9 May 2004,"I know it's easy to put ""Terminator 3"" down. Everybody had great expectations and it was clear that this movie would have lots of enemies, especially if someone else than Cameron was going to direct. So, here it is now, T3, and the truth is, it is a good action movie, just not as good as Terminator 1 & 2.What I liked best about this movie is that it doesn't include any martial arts. Since ""The Matrix"" came out, I often wondered if it would even be possible to make an action movie without Kung Fu anymore. Also, Mostow really tried to not only focus on the action but include some story and character development, too. The problem is, the story is nowhere near as good as it used to be. The writers mistook character development for endless whiney monologues by John Connor, supposed leader of mankind. Where Cameron always found the right balance between someone explaining what was going on and action scenes, T3 fell into the trap of slowing down too often.What's bothering me even more, is that writers really had a lot of chances to turn Terminator 3"" into an interesting story that picked up from the end of T2. I hoped that finally we'd get an explanation for why only one Terminator is sent back at a time, how the time portal works, how CyberDyne recreated the information on future technology after it had been destroyed in part 2, etc. Instead writers gave vague or no hints at all to previous riddles and went away too far from the original ideas of Terminator"". No fate but what we make for ourselves"" we were told in parts 1 & 2. Now it has changed to Judgement Day is inevitable"". Why is that, you may ask yourself and why would a Terminator know that? It's only one of many things that don't really make sense. A fact that's even more annoying when you think about how perfect the series has been so far. Sure, James Cameron had also made mistakes (John's and Sarah's age, for instance) but the main story did always make sense.Mostow obviously was afraid of stepping into Cameron's shoes and be compared to him, so he decided to put several nods to the previous movies in sequel no. 2. Nice thought, but T3 is definitely too much of a nod"" to T1 & T2. It's part parody, part rip-off that has only few new elements. Again there are two Terminators, one brand new, one obsolete, we get a spectacular car chase, desert scenes, etc. Furthermore, we get a funny version of the bar scene at the beginning and a funny"" cameo by infamous psychiatrist Dr. Silberman. Yes, some of the jokes are actually quite funny, but really, why would the Terminator smash the gay glasses? Come on, this is supposed to be a serious movie! The worst thing about all this repeating old stuff is that this time there's no suspense whatsoever. It just feels like we've seen it before and we know exactly what's coming.One scene that could have brought a cool twist to the movie was the one where Arnold gets reprogrammed by the T-X. It would have been so cool, if the T-800 had turned into the bad guy again now. It would have showed that a machine knows no loyalty. Instead we got the most stupid scene ever in a Terminator"" movie: John Connor asks the T-800 not to kill him and the Terminator obeys. Reese said in part 1 It can't be bargained with"" and now John did just that. Sad. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. And what's with John Connor? Isn't he the one who will go on to lead mankind? In T3, he isn't much of a leader to me. Is it the writers fault or Nick Stahl's, I don't know, but the character is such a sissy in this movie, it's painful.About the T-X: why the hell isn't that thing bigger, stronger, faster? The T-X has no real improvements compared to the T-1000 and it seems to be really stupid. How else could it lose to the trashy T-800? And why did it change back to its known form just before it could have killed Kate Brewster in the disguise of her fiancé. Why would it walk around with the same face all the time, anyway? (Granted, that's a question that T2 had already raised and not answered) Although Kristinna Loken played her part quite well, I think it was a bad decision to have a woman play the T-X in the first place. How cool is it to watch Big Ol' Arnold beat up a girl? There are so many more minor mistakes in this movie it gives me headaches (why was the T-800 already programmed to not kill innocent people and look for the keys in the car when it was a different Terminator than the one in part 2? If Arnie is not programmed to answer John's questions why did he answer when John asked if he was gonna kill him? Why did the T-X investigate the place where Kate Brewster works at night? Why didn't the T-X try to reprogram the T-800 from the beginning? Why has the Terminator never used the little atom bomb chip, he's carrying within, against an enemy?), but I think I better stop here.However, I did like the ending a lot as it's the only real improvement to the whole story and an open door for a sequel. ""Terminator 3"" is still the best action movie of this summer and it feels really good to see Arnie back in action one more (last?) time.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

While certainly inferior, it had so many obstacles to overcome legally and financially that we're lucky we even got a film at all — and in the end; at least they did the best they could. Arnold looks like he hasn't aged a bit since ""T2"" and that alone must've been a lot of work. There's an obvious void with the absence of Cameron and Hamilton, and Nick Stahl is a poor recast of Furlong. The T-1000 is replaced with T-X (Loken), a female terminator that is dangerous and sexy, but she can't live up to Robert Patrick's nearly invincible villain. The story is well-written, with a decent attempt at explaining away any holes left in ""The Terminator"", but it fails to recognize important plot points from ""T2"". The self-awareness of the filmmakers knowing it's an inferior film makes ""T3"" an entertaining, fun and even humorous journey. The special effects live up to ""T2"" and the story's outcome is unpredictable. It's sometimes darker than the first two, sometimes lighter; at some points better, at other points inferior.

146,tomimt,Good sequel of the Terminator franchise,8,27 January 2006,"My next comment will get all James Cameron fans angry, but then again that is entirely their problem. I liked T3 better than T2.Sure, there are plot holes in T3 where you could drive a truck through, in fact I think they do in couple of occasions, but the bottom line is, that I was entertained more by this film than I was by T2. The main reason is, that I've never been found of Edward Furlong in the role of John Connor. I thought he was a bit annoying character in T2. In T3 John (Nick Stahl) is still a bit whiny, but he wasn't as annoying.Linda Hamilton didn't return, which was a bit shame, but luckily the movie works without her. Claire Danes substitutes as a female hero, Kate Brewster, who resembles Hamiltons original role from T1 as a woman who doesn't first believe, but soon gets the situation.Arnold is back of course, as a protector as in the T2, but now he has more attitude and his role is actually a lot better than it was in T2, at least I liked him more as a ""don't mess with me"" kind of a robot.Kristianna Loken is more modified liquid circuit Lisa, who this time is able to generate weapons out of her limbs, as in energy guns, flame thrower and such.T3 is nonstop action from the beginning to the end. The pseudo philosophical aspects of two previous Cameron films have been dropped almost completely and the action scenes have grown bigger and more showing. There are couple of hilarious action scenes as well and Arnold's Terminator is a bit more comical, but not too much.As said, the movie has a couple of scenes which could have used more plot, but overall pros win over the cons.

However it's the story line which suffers, and is not developed in T3. The films fails to link the new aspects of what is going on with the other 2 films, mainly because the creator of the first two did not even envision a third. This time the plot concerns John Conner (Nick Stahl) more than it does the Terminator (Sharzenegger) and Conner with the help of the Terminator has to stay alive in order to save the human race on judgement day. Meanwhile a new terminator, Tx is after him to kill him, played by Kristanna Loken. Loken brings much sex appeal and hype to the role, but one can question how believable she actually is a dangerous terminator. Stahl does fairly well in his role, Shwarzenneger is pretty good reprising his role and is very comedic in some instances. Claire Danes probably gives the best performance of the film. The rest do not really matter to the plot except for Kristanna Loken who had little to say and was not the best actress for the role, although she definetely had screen presence. Overall some great action sequences, decent dialogues and some very comedic parts. Overall better than most action flicks released these days. 8/10",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
149,anselmdaniel,Formulaic,6,29 June 2019,"This review contains spoilers.'Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines' is the sequel to Terminator 2: Judgment Day. The movie is directed by Jonathan Mostow. The story is written John Brancato, Michael Ferris, and Tedi Sarafian. The movie stars Arnold Schwarzenegger, Nick Stahl, Claire Danes, and Kristanna Loken. The movie takes place many years after the end of Terminator 2: Judgment Day. John Connor, played by Nick Stahl, is living off the grid. Skynet re-emerges through a new model called the T-X to assassinate John Connor's lieutenants. The threat of another Judgment Day becomes inevitable as the threat of Skynet still looms.Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is an unnecessary sequel. The movie simply did not need to be made after the conclusion of Terminator 2: Judgment Day. The second Terminator movie had ended the franchise in a satisfying way. The sequel is still serviceable. The movie is well-directed for the most part. There are fun and exciting action scenes in this movie. The truck chase scene is one of the highlights in this movie. The cast overall do a good job. The movie is still serviceable and the movie as a whole suffers from lack of a reason to exist.The villain in this movie is the T-X. The new terminator is a hybrid between the T-800 and the T-1000. The new terminator assumes a female appearance. The terminator is set up well throughout the movie. The T-X is able to maintain an intimidating presence, but it is not nearly as strong as the T-1000 in the previous movie. There are interesting aspects that the T-X has such as advanced weaponry that it possesses from the future. The movie makes this abundantly clear and focuses on it. However, the alien-like quality of the T-1000 is missing here and that ultimately causes the villain to suffer.The movie does not have John Connor as the solo protagonist. Katherine Brewster, played by Claire Danes, and the T-850, played by Arnold Schwarzenegger, also share the role of the protagonist. The movie commonly moves between these characters and the lack of true focus on John Connor can be distracting. The movie should have been more about John Connor, but he does not embark on a memorable character arc in this movie. John Connor has the arc of being the savior of humanity. It was not satisfying to see it as there was nothing special to see about it. John Connor simply accepts his fate and becomes the savior. Katherine Brewster on the other hand goes from a vulnerable woman to someone that takes a stand against the machines. This arc was slightly more satisfying but it suffered from lack of focus. The entire story did not work well. The T-850 is a centerpiece and the character development of the T-800 from Terminator 2: Judgment Day is copied over to this movie. It did not make any sense for this T-850 unit to behave the same exact way as the T-800 from Terminator 2: Judgment Day. Even knowing that Katherine Brewster had sent the T-850 unit back, it felt like there was no reason for its behavior to be the same as the previous movie.Jonathan Mostow does an admirable job trying to create a Terminator sequel. However, the sequel does not have the same impact as the second movie did versus the first. I would still recommend the movie despite this flaw.Grade: C",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
150,gigan-92,Found It Enjoyable,5,12 June 2010,"I'll say that for the most part this third film by Johnathan Mostow is pretty decent. He clearly made an effort to bring back the same atmosphere that was present in the first two films. This I very much enjoyed that aspect of it all. However, there is a somewhat diminished sense of realism in my opinion. This new terminator has flamethrowers and plasma cannons, built in of course. Oh geez... But I've come to embrace that actually. Except for that scene with KAte's 'fiance'. Didn't anyone notice a guy driving with an arm through his gut. Overdone...The cast is rather well put together, I'll give it that. Gool old Arnold is able to reprise his role as the T-101. Unfortunately this will be the final bout. John Connor is portrayed by Nick Stahil, and he does nicely. One other weakness to this film is the run time. The second film was over two hours, and there was plenty of action and what not. But there was still lots of time for character development throughout. We saw the characters' inner demons, you know? The story in ""Rise of the Machines"" certainly has nice plot points, but their not used to full their potential. Not only that Kate Brewster's father and Skynet. We only see an early scene ""greeting"" scene as a phone chat and short conversation about the system's dangers; and later the opening of ""Pandora's Box"". It was constantly hinted at that Skynet was already beginning its attack in subtle ways, so why not show a little more of the government tension? Getting away from that, the action is superb. Winston's studio does its job with artistic talent. I can say without a doubt the Terminators are looking better than ever. My favorite action scene by far had to be the hand-to-hand fight sequence. I find myself constantly rewinding it. Another plus is Marco Beltrami, one of my favorite composers. I'm definitely not let down. And so, Terminator 3 is an all in all decent contender, but it did not surpass either of the previous films.""Desire is irrelevant. I AM a machine!""",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

152,ctomvelu-1,Tacky sequel,6,2 September 2008,"John Connor is now an adult, and this time around is played by an actor (Nick Stah) who bears not the slightest resemblance to the John Connor of the second film. Mama Connor is nowhere to be found, as actress Linda Hamilton did not appear in the film for one reason or another -- not that it really matters. Connor quickly crosses paths with an old classmate (Claire Danes, of all people) and soon enough they are running from a female Terminator (Kris Loken). A much smaller and older Arnold is back as yet another T-101 trying to save the young pair. The plot from this point is a virtual carbon copy of the second movie, only with louder explosions and longer chases. You can feel the script forcing and stretching this improbable scenario, especially since the whole Skylab issue was resolved at the end of T2. Director Mostow substitutes CGI-heavy action and chase sequences for any sense of forward plotting. T3 is strictly from hunger. Arnold is simply awful and has no presence. Loken is a joke as a ""superior"" cyborg, not half as effective as Robert Patrick's shape-shifting machine in T2. Stahl and Danes do what little they can with this ramshackle story. The ending is bizarre and unsatisfying, to say the least. There is one chase sequence involving some rather large vehicles that, at least on TV, should keep the viewer awake for a bit. In the theater, this same sequence had so much CGI in it that I thought I was watching a badly made cartoon. If you catch this on regular TV, you have nothing to lose -- but it would be better if you know nothing about the first two movies.

153,Bogmeister,"Same Make, Same Model, New Director",8,7 August 2005,"The 2nd sequel to the original '84 sci-fi thriller and follow-up to the '91 sequel was a long time coming, perhaps a few years too long. That could be the main reason the Linda Hamilton character is missing. They managed to eke out a respectable big-budgeter still superior to most of the other action thrillers coming out in the nineties, and especially nowadays, but right off the bat it lacks some of the innovations in the previous sequel. Arnold just duplicates his cyborg character from 1991, perhaps even a bit less human in quality. The new TX super-villain, in female form, is just a bit more advanced than the T-1000, with fancy new weapons and an ability to control other machines (wow, who saw that coming?). The first few minutes essentially duplicate the beginning of the '91 film. The writers seem unable to come up with anything new at this point, even though they had a dozen years. I was dismayed to hear the TX utter one of her first lines and realize it copied one of best lines in ""The Hidden""(87), which itself emulated the first Terminator film. Or, she's just copying the T-1000. Same difference.Another big drawback is the central character of John Connor (Stahl). You get the sense that if he wasn't forced into his destiny as a military leader and messiah, he'd end up as a typical loser in a dead-end job, if not homeless. It's as if he's given up or something; where is the kid who could out-think most adults in the previous movie? I guess it's fashionable to create these loser-type characters in Hollywood's screen writing 101 classes who then do a miraculous turnaround, but it's also tiresome. Connor obviously feels something bad may still occur, otherwise he wouldn't be living 'off the grid.' Shouldn't he be using his brain and talents to keep track of developments in advanced computers which may pose a danger? This seems a motivation not thought out, as in the previous 2 pictures; does he think Judgement Day will happen at the start of the film or not? Of course, it's revealed his mom passed away not long ago, which may explain his despair, as Arnold calls it, but it's never delved into.All that being said, Stahl does a pretty good job of conveying the world weariness associated with someone too young to have so much baggage. You warm up to his character very quickly and are following along through his eyes most of the time. Danes is surprisingly energetic in a role she nabbed in the last minute, I hear. And Loken as the new Terminatrix? She sure has the look; I suppose it's interesting to see a female figure with so much power. The FX are consistently impressive. Mostow is a very good director, and this film could be a case study of seeing the difference between a very good director and a great director (James Cameron). It's fascinating to wonder how much more, if anything, Cameron could have done with the existing material. As mentioned, this film lacks some of the surprises and suspense of the first two; for example, there's never any doubt as to who is the heroic cyborg and which is the nasty one. Mostow basically steered a straight course toward the one point where the audience is unclear of what may happen, the very conclusion. There is where you may find some surprises.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

I didn't really like the parts towards the end, and feel kind of let-down because I enjoyed it for the most part. It could've been much better than what it already was, but at the same time, it could've quite easily been much worse. In the end, we were left with this. The movie is still very interesting to follow. The story is pretty good. But what I'm truly disappointed about is why it took such a long time to make Terminator 3 after the success of Judgement Day - that always baffled me. It looked like a third movie was doubtful or something. If Terminator 3 was going to be made, they should have made it within five years after Judgement Day. The title - Rise of the Machines - wasn't a bad title for the third movie. I don't know what else you could've came up with instead.

158,LebowskiT1000,"An excellent installment, worth the 12-year wait.",10,14 July 2003,"When I first heard that James Cameron wasn't going to be involved with the third installment to this fantastic series, I was less than pleased.  The thought of another director taking over the franchise kind of upset me, I just had to hope that they would find a director that could fill those rather large shoes.  I later heard that Jonathan Mostow was named director of T3 and was pleased due to being VERY impressed with both of his previous directorial efforts, ""Breakdown"" and ""U-571"", but of course I was still skeptical.So the film was finally released and of course I went and saw it opening weekend.  Let me tell you I was NOT let down!  I thought the film was truly fantastic!  I'm sure a lot of people will disagree with me and I'm sure plenty might even get upset with me, but I thought ""Terminator 3"" was just as good as both previous installments of the series.  They all had their pros and they all had their cons.I was at first a little uneasy with the idea of a female terminator.  But, after seeing the film and thinking about I've come to the conclusion that having a female terminator if a brilliant idea.  What would have an easier time infiltrating just about anything?  A gorgeous and sexy woman or a large intimidating man?  The woman, definitely!  Besides, Jonathan Mostow did such a fantastic job with the T-X that it just worked perfectly.The special effects in the film are truly amazing, looking even better than the effects in T2.  There were VERY few times where I thought it looked like obvious CG.  There is one scene in the first few minutes of the film that show a slew of Terminators walking around doing what they do that nearly brought tears to my eyes, it looked so awesome!  I won't get into the specifics, but the special effects are reason enough to see this film.The actors all did a fantastic job.  I thought Nick Stahl was an excellent replacement for Edward Furlong.  When I first heard Nick was taking over the role I didn't think he looked the part, but he really pulled it off.  In fact, in the end, I'm happier that Nick took over the role rather than Edward Furlong continuing his role, because I really don't think Edward looks the part anymore, he was fine as the young John Connor, but I don't think he'd work well as the John Connor of this film.  Claire Danes did a fantastic job as well, she pulled off a great job in the film and looks as beautiful as ever.  Kristanna Loken plays the part of the T-X very well, looking sexy as can be and doing a great job with her facial expressions and her limited dialogue.  I'll definitely be keeping an eye out for her future work.  Then of course, there's the great Arnold Schwarzenegger, reprising his role as The Terminator (T-800/T-101).  Arnold, again was excellent as the Terminator and didn't let me down.  There is also a very nice cameo by Earl Boen, the only other actor to reprise a role from the first two installments in the Terminator series.  Despite having very little screen time, he did a great job and I was very happy to see him in the film.Personally I thought the story in this film was great and very well thought out.  There are a few things that may have been overlooked or improperly explained, but nonetheless, this is a movie we're talking about here and there are bound to be a few plot holes, so I didn't let those little things affect my enjoyment of the film.The only thing I would complain about if I had to, is some of the humor in the film.  I won't deny that the jokes were funny, but I thought some were a little misplaced, this is, after all an R-rated sci-fi/action film.  There were only really two or three comedic moments that I thought should have been excised from the film, but otherwise I thought everything worked pretty well.I would definitely recommend this film to anyone that liked the previous Terminator films.  I would hope that you can enjoy this for what it is and not what James Cameron MIGHT have done had he directed the film.  Just because Cameron opted not to direct the film does not mean it's a bad film. Don't get hung up on the fact that Cameron didn't direct it, just sit back and enjoy the ride.  Thanks for reading my review, and be sure to check out my reviews for both previous films: ""The Terminator"" and ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"".",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
159,OriginalMovieBuff21,A cool movie with funny scenes,8,9 June 2004,I remember seeing T3: Rise of the Machines with a buddy of mine with his friends and all I could do in the movie was just laugh at Arnold's silly jokes. Well he isn't a very good actor and he can barely speak but he has a lot of potential and that's what I like about him in his character. This was a fun and entertaining thrill riding that I deeply enjoyed. Well it wasn't better than the 1st two but I still liked it and T-X was extremely hott!! She was also a kick ass fighter with an incredible body. Go rent this movie and enjoy it. Have some popcorn and relax if you can because it can get a little freaky.Hedeen's outlook: 7.5/10,Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
160,raypdaley182,"truly, truly dire.",4,7 November 2005,"It gets a 4 for the special effects only! This film starts by making basic mistakes and then progresses to bigger and bigger howlers.Let's see. Mistake number 1. The T-X. Right well X = 10. The last bad guy was a T1000. So she's a lower rated model than him then ? Any wonder when she materializes in the window of a clothes shop she ignores the abundance of clothes around her. Also it looks like she's in Rodeo Drive. And she still can't see clothes so she has to rob someone? And the person she robs just happens to be her exact size? Odds of that? Not really going to happen is it? Then the next mistake. She's looking for the lieutenants. So she accesses school records by phone (as these are supposed to be secure under the Data Protection Act it'd be unlikely their kept on a server that has dial-up access.)Then to compound that mistake she manages to locate where they work from their High School records? Wouldn't it have been easier for them to have had her accessing the IRS or DMV records. DMV as they would have a more recent picture than their high school, then IRS as it'd show where their paying income tax.She identifies Jose with a badge id and she scans his eye. Why? Like his High School records had retina information on them? No, I truly think not. Then she shoots him 4 times. The most advanced model can't kill with 1 shot from 5 feet? She must be an older model then.Then Arnie can't decide which model his robot is. Is he a T101 or a T800? Make your mind up Arnold! Also why John avoids the deer, he's an idiot. Why hurt yourself, at that speed you would have barely wobbled when you hit the deer.He seems to get a ride OK, but you'd think anyone giving him a ride would take him to a hospital. He could give a fake name and address, pay for his treatment in cash. He wouldn't appear on the grid by doing that. Another overlooked mistake.So why does the logic driven T-X go to Kate's work address at 5am? Like she's going to be working at that time in the morning. Really logical, isn't it! And again when she kills the cat lady, she fires 5 or 6 shots. An advanced killing machine that can't kill with 1 bullet? Even when Arnie said in the last film he had detailed files on human anatomy.The next chase sequence where the sun seems to rise very fast is lifted wholesale from Terminator 2. It's far too similar, showing lack of creativity. Having the Doctor from Terminator 1 & 2 shows a nice bit of continuity.And the T-X killing Kate's boyfriend is just like the T1000 killing John's foster parents. Not a new idea. I had to double take and think when I saw the T-X dressed as Kate (she pulls her out of the truck near the start, that's when she touches her. Where she could have easily killed her as well). Also the fact that this multi-million dollar US Government secure installation, Kate gets into a seemingly very high security area so easily? I think not.And that they don't seem to have any bespoke Anti-virus software or any contingency plans for a virus or a system collapse? Like a back-up system, or the ability to kill all operations without using Skynet? Give me a break!The whole magnet thing was utter garbage. If the T-X was being subjected to high levels of magnetism she'd shut down. Computers and chips don't like magnets! And how did Arnie get to the surface without passing the magnet? Wouldn't the T-X use a safer route as well as she's a newer model (just another indication that she isn't the latest model).Also why Kate isn't starting up the plane as John is clearing everything from the ground. The World's about to end and their on a dead-line and she's taking her time, why? I'll assume the T-X learns where they are going from Arnie's memory when she re-programs him. Now he's in the helicopter with her so why he doesn't try and blow her up while their in flight? And she found a helicopter already with fuel in it? The end of the film is pretty dire. Skynet has gotten itself into computers so there's no core. No Big deal. It just started a Nuclear War! When bombs drop you get EMP (Electro Magnetic Pulse) That fries computers. The only systems that would then hold Skynet would be in the bunkers where the humans are hiding. All that means is they yank their power for a few vital seconds and then the only place Skynet could still be, is in the satellites.No worries. Just never build anything that uses those frequencies or fire a few missiles into space at them. Or get whoever is in the International Space Station to shut them down. Then NO Skynet.That's the biggest mistake of the film, none of the writers seem to know what would happen to computers and databases after a nuclear attack. Piece of cake. The so-called ""inevitable"" has just been derailed by me very easily. In a matter of moments, because I bothered to use my brain.Nick Stahl was rubbish. Arnie was fair to middling. Kristina Lokken was awful. Clare Danes was utterly awful. This film could have been so much better. Shame it wasn't.Hopefully the script writers read these reviews? Learn about EMP boys?",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
161,cinematic_aficionado,Another good one...,10,27 December 2003,"I remember looking so forward watching the 3rd terminator as I enjoyed immensly the first too, but there was a shadow of a doubt in me, as Lida Hamilton was not part of the team, James Cameron was not the director and in general sequels suck!!!So July 31st arrived (UK premier) and with my housemates prebooked tickets so we would be among the first.I must say that I was very impressed as I was with the previous 2 and when it was released on DVD I bough tit straight away and I have watched it twice already.The story line, pretty much the same as the last two T's, two machines came from the future: one to kill john connor the other to protect him, but with nice twists and sub plot in between it was not very predictable after all. You will not get bored in this movie...far from!!!Above all are the effects: T1 and T2 are considered to be ahead of their time when it comes to visual effects and in the 3rd one...well these people have done a hell of a job to keep the Terminator effects tradition very much alive setting new standards.And on a personal note: Kristanna Loken can terminate me any time!!!Without a doubt, a must see/must have movie",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
162,Rickting,We didn't really need it but it doesn't terminate the legacy of the first two,6,8 March 2015,"James Cameron's Terminator films were both masterful slices of science fiction, and one of the best robots in cinema history (Played blankly in the best possible way by Arnold Schwarzenegger) left his dent in popular culture. Terminator 2 had a great ending, so we didn't need a sequel. For 11 years they managed to resist the temptation, but eventually they gave in. James Cameron wisely decided not to return, and some random director (Jonathan Mostow) directs the next chapter, as a different terminator in Arnie's shape returns to protect John Connor and his future wife from another robotic assassin. T3 does a decent enough job and could have been worse. The Terminator films benefit from an interesting storyline about fate and the apocalypse, and a surprising amount of emotion for films starring robots has kept all 3 afloat. T3 has a more distant, but still palpable, emotional core. In terms of action, the film does not disappoint and delivers many a thrilling, explosive set pieces full of well executed explosion heaven.A problem which is the main reason why none of the films got a 10 from me is that the Terminator films are too reliant on chase scenes which can become repetitive. Until the strong final third, the film often feels like an extended chase sequence and peaks too early. There's still a decent plot, but the main characters are annoying and the antagonist is just a blank female version of the T-1000. The CGI doesn't look as ground-breaking as it did in 1992, so she's lame. Plenty of entertainment weighed down by a routine script carries on, until the interesting final act where Judgement Day happens and this twist makes sure the film leaves a better legacy than it might have done. T3 doesn't need to exist, but it could have been a lot worse. Not a spectacular sequel, but still entertaining and not as bad as some other third chapters. It's not another The Godfather Part III.6/10",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
163,dilipbts,Terminator 3 rise of the machines,8,19 June 2020,"I know it's easy to put ""Terminator 3"" down. Everybody had great expectations and it was clear that this movie would have lots of enemies, especially if someone else than Cameron was going to direct. So, here it is now, T3, and the truth is, it is a good action movie, just not as good as Terminator 1 & 2.What I liked best about this movie is that it doesn't include any martial arts. Since ""The Matrix"" came out, I often wondered if it would even be possible to make an action movie without Kung Fu anymore. Also, Mostow really tried to not only focus on the action but include some story and character development, too. The problem is, the story is nowhere near as good as it used to be. The writers mistook character development for endless whiney monologues by John Connor, supposed leader of mankind. Where Cameron always found the right balance between someone explaining what was going on and action scenes, T3 fell into the trap of slowing down too often.What's bothering me even more, is that writers really had a lot of chances to turn Terminator 3"" into an interesting story that picked up from the end of T2. I hoped that finally we'd get an explanation for why only one Terminator is sent back at a time, how the time portal works, how CyberDyne recreated the information on future technology after it had been destroyed in part 2, etc. Instead writers gave vague or no hints at all to previous riddles and went away too far from the original ideas of Terminator"". No fate but what we make for ourselves"" we were told in parts 1 & 2. Now it has changed to Judgement Day is inevitable"". Why is that, you may ask yourself and why would a Terminator know that? It's only one of many things that don't really make sense. A fact that's even more annoying when you think about how perfect the series has been so far. Sure, James Cameron had also made mistakes (John's and Sarah's age, for instance) but the main story did always make sense.Mostow obviously was afraid of stepping into Cameron's shoes and be compared to him, so he decided to put several nods to the previous movies in sequel no. 2. Nice thought, but T3 is definitely too much of a nod"" to T1 & T2. It's part parody, part rip-off that has only few new elements. Again there are two Terminators, one brand new, one obsolete, we get a spectacular car chase, desert scenes, etc. Furthermore, we get a funny version of the bar scene at the beginning and a funny"" cameo by infamous psychiatrist Dr. Silberman. Yes, some of the jokes are actually quite funny, but really, why would the Terminator smash the gay glasses? Come on, this is supposed to be a serious movie! The worst thing about all this repeating old stuff is that this time there's no suspense whatsoever. It just feels like we've seen it before and we know exactly what's coming.One scene that could have brought a cool twist to the movie was the one where Arnold gets reprogrammed by the T-X. It would have been so cool, if the T-800 had turned into the bad guy again now. It would have showed that a machine knows no loyalty. Instead we got the most stupid scene ever in a Terminator"" movie: John Connor asks the T-800 not to kill him and the Terminator obeys. Reese said in part 1 It can't be bargained with"" and now John did just that. Sad. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. And what's with John Connor? Isn't he the one who will go on to lead mankind? In T3, he isn't much of a leader to me. Is it the writers fault or Nick Stahl's, I don't know, but the character is such a sissy in this movie, it's painful.About the T-X: why the hell isn't that thing bigger, stronger, faster? The T-X has no real improvements compared to the T-1000 and it seems to be really stupid. How else could it lose to the trashy T-800? And why did it change back to its known form just before it could have killed Kate Brewster in the disguise of her fiancé. Why would it walk around with the same face all the time, anyway?

The casket of guns and a few other comedic points are good for some laughs. But what this movie suffers from is what makes it invisible and boring compared to the first terminator movies. James Cameron not directing the characters he invented hurts. The presence of Sara Connor is sorely missed. And maybe it because I'm older and harder to please than when Terminator 2 came out (i was like 12 or 13) , or it could be that when it came out CGI special effects were very new and very impressive, now with 12 years, a couple of Jurassic Park movies, Matrix movies, and several hundred lesser movies featuring CGI, the effect no longer seems special and can even seem cumbersome and even downright distracting. All that said T3 will be somewhat enjoyable film though Loken's villain lacks Robert Patrick's utter child-molester creepiness from part 2. But it didn't leave me floored like part 2 did.

165,departed07,Too much of the first sequel; Cameron's absence is a miss,6,22 April 2008,"After Terminator 2: Judgment Day or T2 known to fans introduced computer generated imagery (CGI) effects to scare the living daylights out of people along with bringing character development, great chase sequences, a wicked villain (Robert Patrick as the T-1000), high octane action sequences and making Arnold's character The Terminator a new hero to everybody. And that was all thanks to James Cameron.In 2003, Jonathan Moss (U-571) brings back the hero from the dead along with bringing a new plot to the film. The film still involves John Conner (Nick Stahl) grown up after witnessing the events where he could've been killed by the T-1000. He's a homeless person living on the street where his only survival is his strength and eating off medicine at a local stray pound. His mother Sarah Conner (Linda Hamilton) is dead so the kid's got nobody else left.Now comes the villain in the movie. In the first movie Arnold played The Terminator going after Linda Hamilton and preventing her from having a son who would be the hero in the future; in T2 the villain was T-1000 killing anybody related to John Conner. Now the villain is not a man but a woman who goes by the name of T-X where her mission is to go after future military workers; she kills teenagers left and right from drive-thru restaurants to parties where her main target is Kate Brewster (Claire Danes) the daughter of a military general. Once Kate and John find out what's going on, they go out in hiding before The Terminator catches them and becomes their guardian.T3: Rise of the Machines is okay fun. The action sequences were the only reason to see this movie, but it feels empty without James Cameron directing the third installment of the series where in each of the movies he directed, something new is always introduced.

Coming back to try to kill them is the T-X (model babe Kristianna Loken). This film features some great action sequences that blow away anything done in the overhyped ""Matrix"" sequel and it's good to see Arnold back in fine form in the role he was meant to play. The ""message"" of the film seems to be ""you can't escape your destiny"" and it attempts to answer the questions posed in the previous films about wether or not you can truely change the future by traveling back in time.

I do have a couple of quibbles with the ending, but I can't really get into that without giving away key plot points.. so I'll leave it at this.. this film is a heckof a good time and certainly better than a few of the other over hyped films that we have seen lately.

169,harryplinkett14,Money-grabbing rubbish,1,17 January 2014,"Wasn't the entire point of Terminator 2 that 'there is no fate but what we make for ourselves'? It was a good message, as humans have always had the tendency to deal with their anxieties by attributing inevitability or some sort of cosmic plan to future events. While this may be true, I find it most prudent to subscribe to the view that the future is not set and that it is in our hands. It allows you to live your life to the fullest and to die knowing you spent your life trying to make a difference.I loved the ending of T2. The sacrifices made by the protagonists have proved that future CAN be changed.Unfortunately, when a sequel promises a safe way to earn lots of money, it does become inevitable.So what is the message this time around? That future is inevitable anyhow, and no matter what you do the universe has conspired to entrap you and make you a helpless pawn in a grand scheme where life, death, even love are pre-determined. This is a rejection of everything the previous two (excellent) films have stood for.Having rejected the essence of the previous films, T3 goes on to reference more marginal elements from them, because that's what the audience wants, right? Give us Arnold as the Terminator, give us those beloved references. Let us re-live some of that past awesomeness! But it's a pale copy. The film does not feel genuine in any way, and it is less competently written and directed than the previous installments. The antagonist is a useless bimbo that is in no way menacing, and the protagonists are made to say stupid lines and either sit in the back of a van or run around aimlessly.So what is good about this film? Well, Arnold, of course. He is the reason we are watching this. The rest is just nonsense we have to endure so we can see Arnie do his stuff. And he delivers, although he can't do anything to fix a poorly written script.Going back to the script, now we learn that Connor's wife is suddenly a major player in the resistance, which was never even hinted at in the previous films. Moreover, their children too are important. You can just tell they are making up stuff just so they can squeeze in new characters and make it possible to extend this franchise forever. And the original myth about John Connor? Who cares. If we think we can make another sequel by inventing Connor's relatives, ex-wives, cousins, children, grandchildren, math teacher, pet dog, etc. we will shove these characters into the plot.As we have seen, T4 further distanced itself from the original film and now anything goes. As long as there is a robot that looks like a human skeleton in it, you can call it a 'terminator' movie and start making money.The bottom line is that T2 was the end of this story. It was nicely wrapped up by the creator of the original film and there was no need for a sequel, or a prequel, or a reboot. It's time for filmmakers and studios to start creating original stories and characters and stop cynically exploiting the original work done by true filmmakers decades ago. We need to start voting with our feet and avoid movie theaters in protest.

171,Al_The_Strange,"""Judgment Day is inevitable.""",8,4 February 2013,"As thrilling as the first two Terminator films were, they made up a rather complete duology. I still always dreamed that a third movie should be made, to take the franchise into thrilling new directions. About ten or eleven years after T2, this film finally came out, with surprisingly little enthusiasm.Outside of James Cameron's hands, it's not quite the same. I can't deny that it's missing a certain charm, or perhaps a certain pathos, that makes the first two films work so well. Regardless, T3 has its share of excitement. The car chase in the opening act, featuring a crane that wrecks a huge number of cars and one whole building, is an excellent and awesome thing to watch. The film maintains really fast pacing with a frequent number of chases and fights. It's also loaded up with quite a bit of silly comedy. I could see audiences loathing the lighter tone of the film, but I think it's a real hoot. Even though these scenes make the film lightweight, it still has serious moments, especially during its final scenes.The film starts off looking quite similar to the other two movies, with two terminators coming into the past, one to kill and the other to protect. It quickly covers thrilling new ground, showcasing a lost and troubled John Connor who winds up literally trapped in some rather amusing situations. When the actual Judgment Day hits, it becomes a mad rush. There's not much room for character or theme development, and when there is, some of the scenes might come off as wimpy (especially in the way John Connor whines and threatens to kill himself in one scene). Regardless, it's a serviceable story with a few surprising twists, even if it doesn't have the same depth or feeling as its predecessors.The film looks slick, with solid photography and editing. Acting is not bad: Arnold Schwarzenegger returns with a tongue-in-cheek portrayal of his iconic character. Nick Stahl does his best to match up with Edward Furlong's portrayal of John Connor; despite being a little unlikable as a character, I think his performance is admirable. Claire Danes and Kristanna Lokken are both fun to watch. Writing is okay; there are a few lines that I wish were expanded upon. This production has plenty of good-looking sets, props, and costumes. Special effects look great most of the time, and a little weak in other spots. Music is pretty good.I'd recommend this as a rental.4/5 (Entertainment: Very Good | Story: Pretty Good | Film: Good)",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
172,PeachHamBeach,Not bad for a second sequel,7,22 April 2011,"This is the third chapter of the TERMINATOR franchise, and it's pretty good with its more modern (the first and second films were made before most of us began making the internet a part of our everyday lives) knowledge and post 9/11 viewpoints.John Connor (Nick Stahl) is now about 25 (?) years old. Sarah Connor has passed away from leukemia and John is sort of drifting through life, just waiting it seems, for the next assassin to cross time and try to end him before the nuclear holocaust takes place.Enter the TX aka the Terminatrix (kind of silly, don't you think? Just because Kristanna Loken's a sexy vixen type?) who is quite well played by the actress, who obviously studied Schwarzenegger and Robert Patrick in the preceding films. Like the T1000 in the second film, TX is a liquid polymer advancement on the original 101 (again, Good Arnold).The film is mostly about how TX begins to kill off future soldiers for the Resistance Movement. She succeeds for the most part, but she can't seem to get to John or his friend Kate Brewster (Claire Danes). While being chased by TX, John, Kate and 101 will find out more about Skynet, and the role Kate's father will play.Though it's a good storyline, this third film doesn't seem as ""fun"" as the first two, in spite of the stunts, effects, costumes and everything. It just doesn't feel the same. Though Stahl does a good job acting, his John Connor ought to have been much more vigilant by this point, and he seemed to think that just because Judgement Day didn't come in 1997, he was in the clear.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
173,DavidSim240183,The flawless Terminator series finally hits a snag,5,12 November 2007,"James Cameron's Terminator films are classics. The original was an exciting, pulse pounding adventure. A gritty SF film with a sharp edge. Then with Terminator 2, he took the framework of Pt 1, and expanded it out into an epic-sized masterpiece. We've had to wait 12 years for a third instalment. But without Cameron in the director's chair, this has had a domino effect.Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is not all bad but its a major disappointment after what we've seen beforehand. This time the director is Jonathan Mostow. And he doesn't have the intense style Cameron brings to his action films.In spite of his over-sized ego, James Cameron is an excellent action film director. His films always have an exhilarating kick. Mostow on the other hand merely 'borrows' from Cameron. If the setpieces in T3 feel eerily familiar, that's because you've seen them in the other Terminator films.T3 is not a direct rehash of Pts 1 & 2. It has got a slightly different plot. But at its heart, its about the same thing. Two Terminators from the future are sent into the past. And their objective concerns John Connor. One to protect him. One to kill him.Aside from Arnold Schwarzenegger, the thread of the Terminator trilogy has always been John Connor. He was a target before he was even born. Then when he was a child. And now as a young man. Gone is the surly Edward Furlong. Now in the role is Nick Stahl.This was the first film I'd ever seen Stahl in. And to say he's disappointing is putting it politely. It's hard to believe this is the person Edward Furlong would grow up to be, and someone who will go on to be the leader of the human resistance, much less the saviour of the human race. Stahl is a positively wimpy John Connor. It's all the more surprising especially after seeing what a good actor Stahl is in films like Sin City and the underrated Disturbing Behaviour.T3 has slightly adjusted the plot for this latest instalment. But not by much. John Connor is again targeted for termination. But he's not alone. His future lieutenants are also on the chopping block. One of them is also his future wife, Kate Brewster (Claire Danes), a humble vet who gets roped into Skynet's latest assassination plan.As for the Terminators, Arnie is present and correct. But the newest addition, and the one spark of originality the film has is a female Terminator, the T-X (Kristanna Loken).Loken is sexy as hell in red leather, but she's disappointing too. She never generates a threatening presence the way Arnie or Robert Patrick did. She's supposed to be emotionless, but she's just too emotional in her inflections. She even smiles. And when she does downplay her emotions, she's just bland.Claire Danes isn't much better as Kate. I suspect she's Linda Hamilton's replacement. Nick Stahl almost says as much when he compares her to his mother. This is untrue. Hamilton had a startling presence in T2. She was always believable when packing a rifle. Danes struggles to make the part her own, and ends up buried in the A-list action sequences and special effects.The film's one ace in the hole is Arnie. At least he comes off with a degree of respectability. The Terminator is a role Arnie could do in his sleep. But thankfully he doesn't sleepwalk through the role. His cold, detached observations are surprisingly funny. Like Pt 2, he's been reprogrammed as a good Terminator, but interestingly, he's allowed some ambiguities. Things he was never allowed in the previous films.Although he's John's protector, he doesn't have to follow his orders. He can outright refuse if he wants. He is even capable of lying. Those are moments pleasantly reminiscent of his acting in Pt 1. Which made me realise how much I missed him being an evil Terminator. Arnie's OK as a good Terminator, but he's great when he's bad!At least the special effects are up to scratch. Most of them involve the T-X. She can form guns, revert to liquid, and even control machinery. As well as effect a few improvements in the chest area! But impressive as these effects may be, they don't come with the awe the T-1000 had when he assumed the pattern of a tile floor. Or gathering his shattered bits into a puddle and reassuming human form. The T-X is technically proficient, but she's curiously unremarkable.The action scenes are on a par with the previous films, but they don't feel as thrilling. The most spectacular is a high speed chase involving an artificial crane, remote controlled police cars, and LA's rush hour traffic. But the action doesn't enthrall you. It's mindless, crash-bang-wallop chaos. You somehow distance yourself from the action on display. It never grabs you by the throat the way James Cameron's action sequences did.One thing that is different about T3 is the fact that the war against the machines is about to begin, hence the title. There are a few nifty scenes involving the first wave of Skynet's robotic legions, including robots that stalk the corridors while searching out their prey. And I did like the way the film doesn't wimp out on us. The war begins in earnest, even if it never shows the devastation of our world being destroyed, making way for the terror that's to come.But still, Terminator 3 never really flies. There are nice ideas here and there, like the T-X trying to deprogram the reprogrammed Terminator, but T3 is very underwhelming. James Cameron's absence had more of an effect than I thought it would. When Mostow tries to emulate Cameron, the results are just embarrassing. A shame this once great series seems to have run dry. Let's hope the next instalment is an improvement.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

Not as good of a movie as it's two predecessors, but action packed and explosive! Biggest problem I had was that the T-X kept ""forgetting"" how powerful it was! Sometimes it ran as fast as a moving car, sometimes it didn't. Sometimes it regenerated immediately, sometimes it couldn't. I think the script writers really dropped the ball on this model's abilities. And the plot suffers because of that.Cool to see Dr. Peter Silberman again! SUPER cool NOT to see that high-pitched whinny kid that played John Connor in part 2! Honestly, this film should get 10 starts for keeping that actor out of this picture!

176,Cinemaniac1984,"Great to see the Terminator again, but not a memorable classic compared to the previous Terminator movies",7,4 February 2015,"After 12 long years, the Terminator is back. Between 1991 and 2003 there were many rumours surrounding a possible Terminator 3 with James Cameron at the helm and the return of Arnold Schwarzenegger. However, with many ideas going flat as well as possible adversaries to beat the T-1000 (one magazine in 1995 suggested Shaquille O'Neal was going to be the next Terminator to go up against Arnold) however nothing eventuated, particularly with Carolco Pictures going bankrupt in 1996. A lot of Terminator fans were eagerly looking forward to see a new Terminator sequel. Terminator fans had their prayers answered when Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines was released in 2003. I thought Terminator 3 was a good movie and a worthy sequel, but overall was not great. To be fair, it was certainly going to be a hard act to follow. Given that Terminator 2: Judgement Day was a huge blockbuster that set the benchmark for all movies, Terminator 3 had a lot to live up to.Following the events of Terminator 2: Judgement Day, we learn that Judgement Day did not eventuate on August 29 1997 however John Connor (Nick Stahl who has taken over from Edward Furlong) has since disappeared of the grid. His mother Sarah Connor has since passed away from leukaemia, John does small jobs from time to time and lives as a drifter around Los Angeles. John still lives in fear that Skynet may track him down and kill him. Unable to find John Connor, Skynet sends back the T-X (Kristanna Loken), an female Terminator with an advanced prototype succeeding its predecessors with built-in weaponry within its endoskeleton, a liquid metal exterior similar to the T-1000, and the ability to re-program other machines. The T-X is sent back to terminate John Connor's future lieutenants and other members of the human resistance. Another objective of the T-X is to terminate John Connor's future wife and second in command Katherine Brewster (Claire Danes). To protect and ensure the survival of John Connor, a new Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is sent back by the human resistance to prevent the T-X from successfully completing her mission. At the same time, Katherine Brewster's father who is a high ranking US Air Force Officer General Robert Brewster (David Andrews) has taken over from Miles Dyson's work from Cyberdyne Systems is linking up the US Military computers to a program called Skynet to run the entire US Military system. The Terminator, John Connor and Katherine Brewster must race against time to prevent the T-X from successfully completing its mission, and to prevent the nuclear war.Jonathon Mostow (U-571, Breakdown) takes over from James Cameron who declined to take the director's chair. Though Jonathon Mostow does a good job and he remains faithful to the previous Terminator movies, he still does not have the same magic touch as James Cameron. It was good to see various references to previous Terminator movies, but in terms of action it was certainly not going to outdo the previous Terminator movies. Terminator 2: Judgement Day certainly expanded on the first Terminator movie, whereas in Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines it continues on the legacy by bringing forth new ideas.Arnold Schwarzenegger returns in his iconic role as the Terminator. Though Arnold Schwarzenegger was 54 years old at the time of filming, he still has the Midas touch, one-liners and all. It was a thrill to see Arnold Schwarzenegger return as the Terminator. It was also the last starring role for Arnold Schwarzenegger before being elected as the Governor of California.Nick Stahl was uninspiring as John Connor came across as a bit wimpy and was came across as a geek compared to Edward Furlong who had a lot more guts with his character and possessed a strong personality as John Connor, somebody with backbone who had the potential to be a future leader of the human resistance. Unfortunately Edward Furlong was missed as John Connor, however was dropped from his famous role due to substance abuse problems.Kristanna Loken as the T-X did not have the same intimidation factor as the first Terminator and the T-1000, but she was just met the standard as a worthy adversary in this movie. She barely has any speaking parts as well.Claire Danes as Katherine Brewster came across as very mature and was someone that stood up and fought back rather than come across as a helpless damsel in distress. She moves on from her past roles such as Romeo and Juliet (1996) to portray John Connor's future wife and a strong willed second in command.Earl Boen reprises his role in a brief cameo as Dr Peter Silberman from the previous Terminator movies. Though it was only one scene, it was great to see the famous Dr Silberman return in one scene.As previously mentioned some of the action scenes in the movie were not as memorable compared to the previous Terminator movies. The crane pursuit through downtown Los Angeles wasn't bad but didn't exactly outdo the action scenes in the previous Terminator movies which were a classic and kept audiences excited. The climax where the machines take over the Air Force base was the most exciting part of the movie.Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines was always going to be a hard act to follow compared to its predecessors but it is certainly a worthy entry into the Terminator series. I was also glad that Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines didn't have the violence watered down, although it was noticeably less violent. Though Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines was not a memorable classic compared to The Terminator and Terminator 2: Judgement Day, it left me satisfied well enough that it was good to see the Terminator blast onto our screens once again.7/10.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
177,PyrolyticCarbon,"A poor sequel to a wonderful series, a joke of a Terminator movie.",6,25 August 2003,"It's a shame, this movie started off so well, and with so much promise, despite the concern as to the absence of James Cameron, I thought the plot looked good and Arnie was back.However, it really quickly turned into a joke of a Terminator movie. Not much brooding terror as the Terminator entered the present day again; comic laughs were played for from the outset. Surely Leslie Nielson was due in at any second?Saying that, there were some of the original elements still there, the darkness; the downside to the story; the future twist that was yet to happen and you'd probably never see, and the human moments while the excitement was still thick in the air. Unfortunately, many of these were just swept over quickly in short bursts of dialogue to make way for another huge set piece.Not that the set pieces weren't amazing, it's just that by the end of the film, you feel that it was almost all a collection of set pieces. The audience was hardly given time to digest the shocking revelation from the Terminator, nor did any of the characters discuss it before heading off into the fight again.The other thing that hit me were the completely corny moments, two in particular stand out, the chance meeting of John Connor and his old school chum. How amazing was that considering that John Connor continually keeps moving and never stays in the same place? Then there was the need for the new Terminator to announce her findings of the DNA sampling to absolutely no one, despite the audience having already seen them flashed across her computer enhanced vision. American audiences I assume.In fact, the new Terminator isn't that scary or foreboding, and often she looks clumsy and awkward. Not a patch on the Terminator in T3, in fact none of the characters live up to their predecessors.I have heard talk of more sequels. I can only pray that James Cameron is out there, reading these, having watched the film, and decides he can't let the series be butchered again.

The unexpectedly melancholic ending is poignant though and provides the sort of unique and provoking additional content needed for a franchise's third film.

181,emperor_bender,Sad.,5,23 January 2009,"Don't get me wrong, the movie was still pretty good. It just paled in comparison to the cinematic artworks that were the first two films.The story was on the weak side here. A female terminator called the T-X (played by Kristanna Loken) is sent back to kill John Connor (played by a stale Nick Stahl). That's not a rip off of T2, right? And also like T2, an even further outdated T-800 (somehow called a T-850)(Arnie again also) is sent to protect him and his wife who was never mentioned before, Kate Brewster (played by a boring Claire Danes). Apparently Judgement Day wasn't stopped, making T2 completely useless.The effects were good but over-used. Especially in fight scenes. Also, T-850's clothes were sort of goofy, as well as his attitude. He was just too robotic and not even in the sense that he was supposed to be. He seemed to be reading cue cards and not trying to be a robot half the time. John Connor was very weak here, as well as Kate Brewster. I hope she will be omitted from the so-called ""script"" of the upcoming Terminator 4.OK, I can't stand to talk about this pathetic excuse of a Terminator movie anymore. I'm gonna go watch T1 and T2 and pray for forgiveness for even considering this movie to be in the same league as them.5/10.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
182,supertom-3,For me the series goes from best to the worst (but still good!),7,18 July 2003,"This is a definite return to form for Arnie and his first box office hit (maybe, depending on the drop off) and critical hit since ironically his last outing as the T-800, in T2. Yes True Lies was a box office hit but critically the response was very mixed, although fairly good in Britain. This is also his best since True Lies, it has more in the way of story but the action doesn't quite come up to Jim Cameron standard (little does!).
Before going on about the strengths of this film I'll comment on the weaknesses. The film has a lot to live up to, and in the end fails to live up to the first two films, while it is still a worthy sequel. Some of the significant weaknesses are the fact that the story is not as interesting or clever, it doesn't have as much character development, although in John's case it does however the other roles are weaker than Sarah Conner and previously Kyle Reese. There is only one prominent 3 dimensional role. As I say Claire Dane's role as Kate Brewster is underwritten and subsequently she is wasted, for instance her fiance is killed by the TX and it has little effect on her, it is not touched upon and is forgotten within five minutes, then the developing relationship between her and John gives her an air of coldness. The thrills lack the excitement and punch of the first two, which is not to say they aren't exciting, but hey its up against Jim. The final action scene is the weakest of all three films and is semi rehashed from the first film. The main problem is that the humour of the film is not as subtle as number 1 or two. It seems that as the franchise has moved along the humour has increased, but here it is bordering on spoof.
Another key problem is that Arnie no longer is the head of the movie, he doesn't command the screen like he used to, and his role seems to be that of the Terminator doing an impression of the Terminator, funny as it is to see him send himself up slightly, the humour is far to overt and corny. There doesn't seem to be a need for Arnies character in this one (in terms of the way it is written rather than his overall impact in the story, he still has to save them but aside from that his presence is solely about laughs), the TX is a great adversary and once again Arnie plays protector but his role still wasn't 100% pivotal. T1 and T2 with no Arnold and they would be half of what they are, he held the movies together, his role is written with so much comedy involved that he seems like a caricature, it thankfully doesn't affect his dramatic moments too much though. Some other problems are the disappointing impact of Arnies change from good to bad, this could have been much more exciting, in the end it is very brief and lacks punch. Also the future war scenes that gathered much fan interest before the films release are very small and no more than the first two films, I would liked to have seen more because the idea excited me, that is not too big a problem though as it is bound to happen in the next instalment. To round it off into one sentence, it doesn't feel like the Terminator films that Jim Cameron weaned us on! Also Beltrami's score isn't as memorable as the synthy resonance of Brad Fiedels scores. The score seemed fairly cliched and not as inspirational as some of Marcos other work.Okay my disappointments out the way, and I was a little disappointed at the film considering the early reviews suggested it was going to be very, very good, I found much to enjoy. John Connors role is good and Nick Stahl plays it well, in fact he holds the movie, and this is vital considering the minimal scripting of the other characters, mind you the major focus on him is warranted of course. The action is good, a little over hyped maybe, such as the supposed 15 minute car chase that must have been 5 at most. Even though the film doesn't seem like a 200 million budget there is still plenty of bang for your buck. The TX rocks. Kristanna Loken looks amazing and she looks like a bad ass bitch, she has made a great movement of her own for the TX. She overdoes it at times but she really steals the movie and steals Arnies thunder. The script is pretty good, especially compared to most actioners, it does suffer from some bad dialogue but even the classic first two films had its moments, what action film doesn't? Of course one of the main things was that it was great to see Arnie back in a big action movie kicking some ass, delivering zingers (that were very Commando, very True Lies, a bit too hokey for the Terminators, but still funny) and handling large weaponry, who else but Arnold could walk out with a coffin full of weapons on one shoulder and a large calibre weapon in the other hand and single handedly  wipe out a squad of police vehicles. With a 150 (at least) plus gross under his belt he now will have better options open to him rather than pap like Collateral Damage. There are smiles on the faces of Ah-nuld fans once more with his first truly decent film in nearly ten years (I don't care what critics say True Lies was the dogs bollocks in terms of mindless fun). T3 will be a worthy edition to any action fans DVD collection, and despite Mostow perhaps overstretching himself, going from a 40 million to a 200 million budget production, he is still looking like a top new director coming through, although as its only his third big film in 6 years he needs to accelerate the releases. Most definitely a worthwhile sequel but it falls far short of the first two. Bring on number 4 baby. ***1/2",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

It just doesn't feel like a ""True"" Terminator movie. It's more or less what Joel Schumacher did to the Batman franchise. Kristanna Loken as the female Terminator added absolutely nothing to the role; she's merely a stop-motion puppet with a pretty face parading around in vacant, dramatically vapid scenes with no genuine flair or excitement.Nick Stahl is pretty much a wimpy John Connor rather than a leader. Not even Arnold's role as the titular character can save this train wreck of a celebrated franchise. In fact, the only good thing about T3 was the ending.

This is a fun, action packed film, but it doesn't live up to the first two.James Cameron is no longer the director, which is the film's first problem. Next, the style is too different. A lot of comic relief was put into the script, and at some points it was highly unnecessary. The story in this movie only manages to confuse anybody that was paying attention to the second film. There are too many questions that go unanswered at the end of this movie. What I did like about this movie was that it finally showed us how the war started, and that was really cool to see. I also liked all the references that were made to the second film, like when John Connor asks the terminator if he remembers ""hasta la vista, baby."" Some of the humorous parts got a good laugh out of me, but it just got to be too much at some parts.The acting was pretty good. Arnold played the role that he created perfectly.

And you can tell that it is a useless sequel, you can tell it's a shame a third one is made and all that other stuff but one thing is sure : from all actionmovieheroes there is only one king and that's Arnold just because he doesn't take himself that seriously... This is more comic than Daredevil, The Hulk and other X-Men's... The story itself is so simple : once again a terminator must travel back to the past to protect John Connor (nice role for Nick Stahl) and his forthcoming wife Kate Brewster (a more than charming role from upcoming star Claire Danes). And then there is that other terminator the female one (played by Kristanna Loken) and that's perhaps the only letdown in the film as she looks like your dreambabe but she doesn't have the evil touch, still very funny to watch...

The big problem is that most of the critics wanna slash down the movie but they just can't as this is too brilliantly made and after 12 years Arnie still rules and the last words of Arnie (""We'll meet again"") says enough that we will have a T4 if only Arnie won't be president of the US in 2015...",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

The addition of Nick Stahl as a young adult edition of John Connor and Claire Danes as Kate Brewster are not really noteworthy and are overshadowed by their AI counterparts. There's also a noticeable gap left by the lack of Linda Hamilton's Sarah Connor, which is a major reason for why 'T3' is knocked down a few pegs.Yes, there are some nostalgic parts of the film (including the familiar beginning scenes), but the plot is otherwise a ""been there, seen that"" trip down memory lane, just with different faces and places.

189,LivingDog,Not Bad,8,24 December 2003,"The first 2 terminator movies were excellent, full of tech stuff, surprises, and action. While this movie has plenty of action the ""newness"" was not present as in the first two. The tech stuff was ok also, but no surprises there.Some cool scenes, some cool Arnold lines. But that's it.

190,kgprophet,Mindless fun - but disrespects T1 & T2,6,2 July 2003,"It seems that this film is the victim of trying to stuff as many 'what if this happens' into the script to the degree that it is no longer a movie, but a 'puff' piece trying get your attention in any way possible.  It's like all these reality shows trying to one-up each other (Who wants to Marry a Survivor Idol).  Many sequels have turned into disappointing rehashes. Alien 3 destroyed the feeling of having emotionally vanquished the big bad bugs by killing the girl and tossing Ripley back in the fire.  Godfather 3 should never be considered a legitimate successor to GF1 & 2.  When a sequel feels the need to outdo it's predecessor, it begins to lose credibility.  The most obvious problem is that, while the first film creates a successful 'formula', and the second film takes the formula and pushes the envelope, the third film can't do anything without feeling like a repeat. 
Indeed, T3 turns into a comedy, because everything it does as a different take on the formula is a joke.  This is too bad,  since you are dealing with a mass murdering cyborg, nuclear armegeddon,  and main characters fighting within inches of their lives.  One scene, the 'new' John Connor pleads for Arnie to help stop Skynet, Arnie replies with a dumb one liner that takes all the air out of what could have been a tense and gripping moment.  Same thing for any moment where we are supposed to take things seriously.  You can't,  so you don't feel the anxiety when lives are in danger. 
T2 had this tenseness,  you cared about their survival.  In T3, you already know the score.  When Arnie first runs into John,  he is scared and asks ""Are you going to kill me?"".  Of course not, we already know he is the good guy from T2.  And so on.  Just like Alien 3 & 4,  you feel you are in an alternative reality,  it has the same characters, same situations,  but it doesn't ring true.  So we are only left with appreciating the stunts and special effects.  The action sequences are fun, thank God (shame on you, Hulk).  The pacing is very good (to the point that it deliberately leaves out some necessary mechanics of the story).  It clocks in less than 2 hours (something that other blockbuster movies should adhere to).  The third act propels the story very well, although the convenient daughter-of-a-Military-General-who-heads-a-secret-program arrangement reeks of cliche (hmmm...such as ""Hulk""?). 
I'll admit I had fun,  something some movies have forgotten about (Stars Wars 2).  I wish T3 could've taken itself more seriously.  But I agree with many other reviewers on this website that it has desecrated James Cameron's creation, (""No Fate But What We Make"" - guess not).  So I guess I like this film,  but it's no T2.  I give it a 6 out of 10.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

I actually liked this movie, better than I thought. I picked this movie up at Hastings entertainment store, for 1.99. I am glad I got my money's worth, it's not the best of the series; but I am surprised by some of the negative comments. My favorite of the series is Terminator, it will always be. I rarely like sequels except for The Empire Strikes Back. I did have a WTF moment in T3 because it did start to get lame for about 15 minutes around the 20 minute mark. I thought I would be turning it off, but I was so wrong. The funny parts were the strip club, especially the dancer, and some of Arnold's quotes. I especially liked the fact they decided to make a female Terminator. In most movies Hollywood seems to portray females as damsels in distress. That is type casting and it is old and so wrong, that's why I hate Hollywood sometimes. They need a dose of reality sometimes. This is the third installment of the franchise and I thought it was good. Even though Nick Stahl played John Conner I thought he was great. I loved the storyline, and the ending was a surprise.

193,OttoVonB,Rise of the Forgotten Hero,6,26 July 2003,"Where will they go next?At the time of writing, T3 has more than made up for its mammoth budget - eclipsing even the record-setting part 2, thanks largely to a reported 30M salary for its leading man - with a considerable box office. It won't be long before the vultures pull at the carcass and find enough sustenance for a part 4, 5 and beyond... But back to 3.The Austrian Oak was in dire need of a hit in the early Naughties, and for many, reviving this particular franchise - if two films constitute a franchise that is - smelled of desperation: haven't we mined this story's potential to the core already? And what of creator James Cameron's complete lack of interest? When your main champion prefers to go deep-sea diving than having anything to do with you, you must have done something wrong...Terminator 3 raised many questions, first of which was: is this even necessary? The truth is: now that it is here, imperfect beast that it is, it is essential. For one, it cleans up narrative issues raised in part two's time travel paradoxes (if you pay attention, Skynet created itself). It also asks interesting questions about choice vs fate, and ends in what is possibly the series most arresting visual moment. It also embraces its throwback nature, not just in accepting its aging star's limitations but in incorporating them to the story, but in its brutal, real action choreography, chiefly a nasty crane-equipped car chase that puts even the computer wizardry of Matrix Reloaded to shame. At the same time, T3 allows itself to partly spoof the original, a point of contention for many, but a refreshingly sober thing for a sequel to do in this day when follow-ups, for some reason, always have to aim for darker (see Matrix and Pirates of the Caribbean).Of course, not all is perfect: after Edward Furlong, Nick Stahl is a somewhat uninspiring John Connor, and Claire Danes is given surprisingly little to do. The worst let-down, though there is interesting conceptual work at play there, is the new antagonist, dubbed the Terminatrix by a mocking audience. There is no doubt that after Robert Patrick's glacial T1000, this is a disappointment, and something more chilling, such as a worrying fusing of human and machine, would been not just more interesting, but frighteningly prophetic, a key trait of the saga as a whole. But when Arnold appears on-screen again, a lot is forgotten and more is forgiven.The first two Terminator films are solid 10s, so by that measure this can't compare, and yet, after the disappointing Hulk and the over-hyped and overindulgent Matrix Reloaded, Terminator 3 may also well be the most entertaining blockbuster you see this Summer.Nowhere near as good or as clever as its predecessors, but good fun nonetheless.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
194,TheHoodOfSwords,Not Good,5,21 August 2020,"It's a fine action movie but it takes a steamy dump on the other 2 Terminator movies. The first one was a fun Sci Fi action romp and the second one was a fun buddy cop comedy action movie but the main thing that set them apart from other movies was the charm and heart behind them. In the first movie that's from the 2 leads and in the second movie it's the humanization of the Terminator. However in this movie my praises are minimal. I'm glad they introduced a ""female"" terminator because that was something I wish there was a bit more of, the Terminators being designed for human appearances. However the female gender is utilized once for a breast gag in the beginning and then never seen again. The CGI also doesn't hold up. Kind of says something when its 2 predecessors had better CGI then this one.The progress of the Terminator being humanized was gone and it feels cheap. Why introduce him back and then pull a fast one on the audience with a ""sike! Not actually the same Terminator!"" Just feels useless.The action is good at times and a few sequences are done pretty well. The crane sequence is fun but incredibly unrealistic even for this series.

The ending is clever. Sure, there are some attempts at comedy, some which work and others don't, but they never become obtrusive. Many of the VFX still look surprisingly good 18 years after its release.I just rewatched it for the first time in ten years or so, and it's still great.

200,shanfloyd,With a good story...,8,28 July 2003,"I was wondering at first if this third installment would live up to the class of the original saga without James Cameron. No, an aged Arnold Schwarzenegger was not my subject of concern. It was director Jonathan Mostow. He was good in U-571 but it was to see how he makes up with all the hypes. I was wondering about the story as well. The Terminator saga differs in this point from the other contemporary movie serieses. That it never had a specific storyline. When the Terminator (1984) was made, nobody knew nothing about a sequel. Terminator 3's exact story was not planned while making Terminator 2 (1992). This is probably the reason behind such long gaps between the movies. But I am quite satisfied with both. Mostow did a nice job. Of course he is no Cameron, but I liked his simple style. This movie had to contain some first-person storytelling by John Connor himself. There was no other way to describe the situation. I felt relieved to see Mostow did exactly that. There were some rather 'comic' sequences and dialogs. I take it as Mostow's credit as well. The casting was quite interesting. Schwarzenegger... well, it's irrelevant if he was good or not at this point. Claire Danes, probably one of the most underrated actresses of recent years, performed very well. Hers was a strong role. And it was perfect casting. Nick Stahl may look geekish in the movie but I found him not that bad as critics are saying. The surprise was Kristanna Loken. The idea of a female terminator was very unique, though not too unexpected. Whether she is decent as an actress the future can tell, but all I can say she fitted into the role very finely. She turned out to be one of the major attractions.And the story! I feel very happy to write that I enjoyed the story pretty much. It has probably the best story out of the three. Why? simply because it connects the past and the future. In the other three movies you just saw the possibility that Connor's going to lead the war against SkyNet in some future. But this movie showed exactly how it all began. In the shell it may look just like a replay of T2, with a robot from future to kill him and a robot to save him. But T3 is not all about that. It was a bold and revolutionary idea to show the start of the war at last. I don't know any plans about T4 this time, but as far as the things are going it may not feature Arnold at all. Quite enjoyable; 8/10.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

Claire Danes is very good as the woman caught up in the mayhem.  The movie also has very good action scenes.  Best of all, it comes in at about two hours, which comes as a welcome relief for those who thought movies like ""Matrix Reloaded"" and ""Hulk"" would never end.  Therefore, I recommend this movie.  However, the movie is not as good as the first two movies, which are classics.  As good as the actor playing John Connor is, he is not as good as Eddie Furlong in the same role in ""Terminator 2.""  I also really missed Linda Hamilton who anchored the first two movies.  The new villain in T3 is not nearly as menancing as the T-1000 in ""Terminator 2"" probably because Robert Patrick is a better actor than the one they have in T3.  Finally, I was not crazy about the ending.  I will give nothing away, but it is a real disappointment.  I honestly don't know how audiences will respond to this ending.

204,Quebec_Dragon,Fine sequel not up to Cameron's previous efforts,7,9 June 2009,"Terminator 3 (T3) often gets a bad rep but I think it's caused more by the greatness of T2 and how it was difficult if not impossible to beat. I didn't like how Skynet was still active even after the events of T2, it seemed to negate most sacrifices made by the protagonist and to slap the director James Cameron's work in the face (shades of Alien 3 here). However, without that, there wouldn't have been a T3 so I would have been quite satisfied if a simple explanation had been given. As it is, I had to check Wikipedia for that. The new director straddles a fine line between rip-offs and homages having at first trouble finding its own voice. It didn't feel as exciting and fresh as T2. The plot and directing were good but not as inspired as T2 either.The terminatrix was not as good a villain as the T-1000, something was missing. Arnold was still in fine form but did look older than previous films (which is unavoidable I guess ;). The actors playing Connor and Kate Brewster were quite good. The first chase scene felt a bit overlong but you've got to admire the stunt work and I don't remember that kind of truck being used in a chase before. The film and action does pick up in the second half making it more suspenseful. I loved the fight between the Terminator and the Terminatrix when they were bashing walls. I thought that was great. I also loved the bold ending very much as it's kind of surprising while also closing the big loop hole left at the end of T2. Overall, I enjoyed it quite a bit, more in the second half than the first.

TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY was an Oscar-winner from the 90's, featuring one of the coolest movie villains in the T-1000. Next in the series is TERMINATOR 3: RISE OF THE MACHINES. In this one, a female Terminator called the T-X (Kristanna Loken) is sent back to eliminate all the future leaders of the human resistance. Yet again, another Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) comes back to stop her from killing John Connor (Nick Stahl) and Kate Brewster (Claire Danes) while getting them to safety before Judgment Day. However... Where the first two films felt fresh and original, this one feels a little more run-of-the-mill. There's more of a comedic wit in this one than in the previous two. But still, it feels like we've seen it all before. It's not as bad as some cyborg sequels (*clears throat* ROBOCOP 3), but it's far from anyone's brightest moment.

I can even go further by saying it's probably the better film out of Salvation and Genisys, and many would agree.
Most problems lie with the specifics surrounding the storyline, which hits many bumps along the way and does nothing to straighten them out, that is why in the third act you sort of see the cracks and plotholes become more evident as it gets near the end.Still, there's a heavily enjoyable aspect coming from the side of the entertaining action, featuring a well-done car chase sequence that could put
other generic car chases to shame. In the acting department, Arnold still does his thing we know so well; Nick Stahl proves himself worthy as a cowardly but intuitive John Connor, who doesn't know what the future holds for him; Claire Danes wonderfully serves as a natural complement to Connor: strong, smart and efficient.
Good call on the casting director to recruit actors who's forte doesn't rely on action nor science fiction, it turned out incredibly well.

The definition of free will, come on. But what does John Connor discover in ""T-3""? That the Final Judge was inevitable. Like Neo of the saga ""Matrix"", Connor becomes a pawn that never had opportunity to change history.And that makes ""T-3"" a Greek movie (""Gods handle our lives and mortals are mere puppets"") as opposed to the biblical / Christian approach to ""the world is like you do"" of the previous ones.And I give a five to the movie because Arnie, his character and his lapidary phrases are still the same.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
208,tburke85,Terminator 3 An Okay Sc-Fi Film But Flawed,4,1 June 2009,"Terminator 3 Rise of the Machines is a disappointment compared to the sequel that came before it T2 Judgment Day. Terminator 3 is an okay sci-film but flawed in many ways. Director Jonathan Mostow (U571) does a decent job of bringing this movie to the big screen but it could've been a lot better. Some action scenes are cool including a chase sequence early on but the dialgoue at times isn't the greatest which made the movie kind of corny. It's basically the same plot of the first film about a time-traveling terminator whose been sent to protect John Connor from another advanced cyborg except this time it's a woman known as the terminatrix. Whose idea was it to make the villain a female terminator? No offense to Kristina Loken who played the villain because she did do a good job in the movie but I just couldn't buy Skynet creating a female terminator. No offense. Arnold Schwarzenegger returns for the third time as another T-800 sent from the future to protect the soon to be leader of the resistance John Connor. Swarzenegger was born to play The Terminator and does a great job with the role but even he can't help this movie from being a disappointment. His talent and mostly everyone else's is wasted in this third adventure of the Terminator series that's basically the same story of the first two films. It offers nothing really new and besides for some cool action sequences and special effects the movie just isn't that good compared to the other three films. Nick Stahl from Bully and In The Bedroom plays Connor this time taking over for Edward Furlong. Stahl gives a solid performance of an off the grid bum who's running from a destiny he can not escape. Claire Danes from The Mod Squad and Stardust plays Kate Brewster who will eventually become Connor's wife in the future and his second in command. Danes is believable as Kate whose world is turned upside down after she has a chance encounter with Connor. The rest of the cast are good in their roles but this one is the worst of the fourth films in the Terminator series. It's not really that bad as far as the action/fight sequences, special effects, and most of the acting goes it just could've been a lot better at least to me. If you're a fan of these type of films and you haven't seen any other the terminator films yet. I suggest you see either the first one, Judgement Day, or the one that came out most recently Terminator Salvation with Christian Bale and Sam Worthington.

210,The_Core,"Lives up to the series, lacks suspense...",7,5 July 2003,"""T3: Rise of the Machines"" had some serious living up to do as far as the first two films are concerned.  In my opinion it doesn't disgrace the series, especially in terms of pure action.  However, it is the weakest of the three in terms of both story and sci-fi.The film, like many other movies with a lot of ""over-the-top"" action, suffers from a curious lack of suspense.  Not that suspense was completely absent, but it takes a strong, coherent story along with powerful acting and believable plot to support a film with this much 'in your face' action, and the film doesn't have it.  Ultimately, nothing much happens, and none of the characters are terribly likeable.  I didn't care too much about what happened to them, in stark contrast to the first two films -- I never felt they were really in any serious danger.  The humor was nice (it really was funny) but always seemed to come at a time when we should have been concerned for the fate of the characters instead.** A few spoilers **I also have issues with the Terminatrix, who displayed a lot of unevenness as far as her abilities go... in the scenes just before she's terminated (am I really spoiling anything?) she looks a lot like an advanced T-101, with parts hanging off everywhere -- yet in the rest of the film it's suggested she's at least as advanced as the ""bad"" terminator in T2, which was made of liquid metal.  In terms of Skynet, the idea that the system has no central core and is distributed ""over the Internet"" is both good and bad.. it makes sense to us, yet it's cliched and silly too (and science-wise, downright impossible).Overall, I enjoyed the movie greatly.  I was greatly entertained by the action, yet afterward the film just felt kind of hollow and vanished from my mind rather quickly... nothing all too memorable ever happened, and I really feel this movie is ultimately another forgettable summer actioner that will be OK released as a series of DVD's with the first two films, but just doesn't stand up alone as a terribly worthy addition to the Terminator franchise.By far the weakest of the Terminator series (except for the action, which was great, maybe too great)... 7/10.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
211,hasosch,Transputing Terminators,7,24 December 2007,"Since the 1930ies, Science fiction, the ""genuine American fairytale"" (Gotthard Günther), has anticipated a world determined by computers. The about six generations of computers built since Zuse share that they are unable to deal with circularity, i.e. self-reference, re-entry, autopoiesis, etc., because they are constructed according to classical logic which does not allow, e.g., a statement like ""I am lying"", since this statement is true when I am lying and false when I am not lying, i.e. it is true when it is false and false when it is true. On similar reasons, comments about sentences are excluded, e.g. ""This sentence is true/false"". When we hear now, in ""Terminator 3"" (2003), a sentence like ""My command is to protect you"" or even stronger: ""Get away from me ... I have no choice ... I cannot control my functions ... I am a machine"", then it is clear that in the case of terminators, we have to deal with a trans-classic logic and hence not with simple computers but with ""trans-puters"", i.e. with computers that allow self-reference because the logical law of the Excluded Middle is abolished.From the above quotation it is also clear that when a machine says ""I have no choice ... I am a machine"", it is self-aware on what it is, i.e. it has its own will. Its third logical value besides position and negation after the abolishment of the Law of the Excluded Middle allows this kind of machine to realize the difference between its program and its intent to react appropriately in a certain situation. Not even the newest computers can realize that, since they follow a logic in which the Law of the Excluded Middle is still valid. Here we also find the profoundest reason why terminators are that human-like (and, conversely, why they like to appear in human-like shape and sometimes lead to ""hermaphroditic"" creatures like ""cyborgs"", ""androids"" and others): Control of will is hitherto still a feature by which humans are differentiated from machines. If we now watch terminators, we see that trans-puters presuppose formalization not only of cognition (like classical computers do), but also of volition. But formalization of volition would imply that from a certain point on the computer would transgress its constructor. There would not be anymore, as in classical computers, a symbiosis between constructor and construction.Such ""poly-contextural"" computers (a term introduced by G. Günther during his work at the ""Biological Computer Laboratory"" of the University of Illinois) with both formalized cognition and volition would fulfill Norbert Wiener's claim for Golem-like ""human-machines"" uttered in his book ""The Human Use of Human Beings"" (1950). However, from a general point of view it is strange that cybernetics, which was established as a science since the Macy conferences in New York (starting in 1946) and is nowadays practically extinct in the academic world, seems to survive in Science Fiction which, in its turn, is anticipating future computer generations. But since ""control"" is a core-term of cybernetics, this science may perhaps become revitalized in times where whole continents are menaced by terrorism. If this is true, one should, however, not forget that total control must not only concern the reign of cognition but most utterly the empire of the will, too. Since this must not be done as in the case of Dr. Mabuse whose aim was simply to replace the will of humans by his own, but in allowing a machine to have its OWN will, the concept of formalization of volition only will imply both control and freedom.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
212,tributarystu,Going for the decathlon?,7,29 August 2003,"I've watched this movie while enduring a terrible headache. Not that I'd want you to jump to any conclusions; it wasn't because of Schwarzenegger. It was because I had seen the sequel to Charlie's Angels(though I haven't seen the original). I might comment on that another time, but just so you know: it's bad.I guess The Terminator is one of this years ""hits"", at least regarding the popularity. Too bad you can't see it now in California, as Arnold is doing his new act. I feared much before this movie, but I can say my fears have been allayed. It wasn't as bad as it could've been; actually it was rather good. SPOILERSSome might have noticed this(or maybe not): I tend to put that ""spoilers"" thingy every time and I don't tell when they end. My way of reviewing actually involves few spoilers, but sometimes, for the film's sake, I just have to put some in...and I definitely don't want any trouble with ""the big guys"" from wonderful imdb. First of all I am impressed by how Arnie has kept in shape! Seriously now, he really does still look like the Terminator we all knew. He cam, he saw, he terminated; that's how I'd call his part. I like Arnold, always have, and I certainly like him more than Stallone or Van Damme. He's just more interesting to watch. All talk very little, but Schwarzenegger did sometimes defy this ""custom"". He is the symbol of the movies and always will be, though the true center should actually be lain, story wise, on the future leader of the human race: John Connor. Nick Stahl does a good job to look like a desperate man, certainly not at as a leader, but he starts being what he will be towards the end. I liked the idea that the woman is always behind the man: quite was here. Nice Clare Danes, too. Miss Kristanna ""TX"" Loken was, of course, the ""big newcomer"". I can't say that I liked her more than the previous terminator. Actually, I liked her less. But if that's what we got, we have to live with her, and I certainly would. The story is somewhat more complex than I expected and the ending really did take me quite off guard. It was certainly the best way the film could've ended so that it would've been good. A ""human win all"" scenario would've been more disappointing. Story wise it is good. What the main problem is? Somewhat expected I believe: similar scenes involving the terminators with the previous movies. The action was very enjoyable, a lot of cars blown up, a lot of people gunned down, stuff like that, but all in all enjoyable. Good direction I'd say, better than expected. Might have been something else with Cameron, but...this was destiny! Almost reminded me of The Matrix towards the end.
Just go and see it. It's a nice flick. If you liked the first two, I don't really see why you shouldn't like this one. A healthy 8/10. Oh, I almost forgot. Did you wonder about the title? Well, if you'll see the movie you might just get your answer.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
213,Jerique,You are terminated! (The series? Definitely),7,30 October 2007,"Arnold Schwarzenegger comes back again as the good guy this time facing an even more powerful opponent, the T-X (Kristanna Loken).John Connor (Nick Stahl) is now an adult and its now the time of the machines beginning to take over. Judgment Day is just a day or two ahead when the movie starts.John Connor's second-in-command and wife, Kate Brewster (Claire Daines), is called into work early morning and meets John Connor (again) because he has stolen pills.Not very long after, the T-X shows up. More than just built to destroy, she is also very seductive and incredibly attractive. She is clever and adapts to her surroundings. It's hard to care about Kate, John or Arnold when Kristanna Loken is on screen.Linda Hamilton and James Cameron are both absent. Sarah has been killed off and Jonathan Mostow (U-571) has taken over directing. Generic writers have taken the writing over. Earl Boen is the only one who has returned aside from Arnold.The action was still great but the story was less interesting than the second film. It seemed they ran out of ideas. The special effects were phenomenal. It took upward ten months for a ten second shot to be captured. The stunts are stunning to watch and the CGI is hard to tell if it's real or fake.After watching behind the scenes you are shocked to find out what was real and what was fake. A few laughs here and there, some cool effects, great stunts, edge-of-your-seat action packed and a super attractive Terminatrix are the reason to not miss this one.Die-hard Terminator fans will be disappointed because it's not as great as part two but will still like it to an extent. Arnold fans, he's still funny and does another great job. But, I think that the series is mainly done. Even if they come out with a fourth part in 2009, I think this is over.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
214,illbebackreviews,Terminator 3 is a cheap rip off from Terminator 2 and everything about this film is done far worse...Not a movie for fans of the first two like myself,3,1 January 2013,"***NEW UPDATE***The movie sucks. ******I'm a huge fan of 'Terminator' and 'Terminator 2' and for quite a while, I've been embarrassed to watch this 2003 sequel as I've heard such mixed reviews from critics and IMDb users alike. Now that I watched, I feel sorta impressed by it.Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines focuses on a 20 year old John Connor who is once again under subject for termination along with his high school friend Kate. This time, an even more powerful T-X is sent back in time but like in T2, the Arnold Schwarzenegger T-101 model is back to save the boy but more importantly Kate.I found the story line in this movie both good and frustrating. It had some interesting elements such as the whole Judgment Day is happening in a few hours thing but there were also some annoying parts such as the over use of ""Get out!"" and the ""I'll (she'll) be back"" As T2 is my 2nd favorite film of all time, I found some annoying things about this film such as the T-101 going into the pub and asking for clothes. Seriously??? I was also frustrated by the T-101 shopping which just looked stupid and was a joke to our memorable character. However, I thought the basic story line of protecting John and Kate and making sure that Skynet could be shut down just in time to prevent Judgment Day from really occurring was interesting and it was nice to see Dr. Silberman's little cameo in this movie. As much as the story line fascinated me, the best thing about the film was surely Arnold Schwarzenegger returning as the T-101. No one else could ever pull this off like Arnie. I was also extremely annoyed by the T-X and I thought the director was just desperate to make someone more deadly than the T-1000 but just failed miserably. The acting in this film was pretty poor, in my opinion. The only one who did a brilliant job was Arnold Schwarzenegger so that can be passed off. However, that scene where the T-101 is packing weapons into the caravan just annoyed me as the director just wanted the conversation to really go when the T- 101 was walking back and forth. It made it really hard to focus on important elements of the story. Since the John/T-101 relationship was magical in T2, I wanted Edward Furlong to reprise his role, 12 years later, as the older John but the whole concept of a different actor playing John made me not care about his friendship and his fatherly love for the T-101.One other disappointment in the film for me was the fact that we never got to see any real machines wasting humans after the machines rose.That being said, the movie is enjoyable but is sure to disappoint many.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

216,TheHande,He's back!,9,9 December 2007,"Terminator 3 was a positive surprise for me. It has all the essential hard-hitting action and narrative of the first two movies, but does away with the unnecessary emotionalism of the second. Terminator 3 is like T2 with more serious intent. I was particularly happy to see Arnold return to the role where he is ultimately at his best. Additionally the movie introduces a new cast of characters which manages to bring a truly more human element into the film. Additionally the action-sequences, while somewhat over-sized still keep you interested in the movie.What was also a noticeable improvement over the last film is the emphasis on the story which progresses in an admirable but not a hectic pace. Also comedy evens out the film so that it doesn't turn into a monotonous experience. The films visual effects are also magnificent.In some aspects the film will never be as classic as the Jim Cameron original. The soundtrack seems to have receded and I can't say I was attracted to the film's score. This is a bit of bummer since the film is otherwise so excellent. Particularly what I was happy with was the fact that we finally saw what the second movie should have shown us: Judgement Day. The film's climax is the ultimate pay-off to a fan such as me.

218,swedzin,"Is this a serious film, or a parody?",3,11 September 2011,"Before I go apesh.t on this film... I just need to know... Why? Who allowed this movie to be filmed? Was anybody serious about this film? Whose idea was this? Of course, no point in asking questions... here are the answers. This film is very, very bad. Johnathan Mostow needs to go work someplace else, like in circus as a clown. If he wants to be funny, give him a chance to be a stand up comedian, not to ruin a good film with this sequel. Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991) was one of the best movies and best SF movies ever made if you ask me... and if you are planing a sequel... give it something worthy, not this crap! The entire film also borrows from the previous film. That's mental!Arnold was good. In his Terminator element, it wasn't any of his fault! The Terminator (Arnie) here looks funny, his character was used for a entertaining purposes! In the first one, he was a dark cyborg with a mission to kill, in the second he was a protector... but here he was a laugh stock! That is a damn sacrilege! The writers and director decided to make one big campy parody of the entire film and title character. The same goes with other characters. Nick Sthal was solid as John Connor, slowly on a way to become a great military leader. But, writers ruined his character too. Claire Danes is a good actress, but here, she messed herself up. Her character was funny, from a veterinarian to warrior women over night doesn't seem right to me! Kristana Loken. OK I admit that we needed a woman Terminator, why not? But, her T-X character was too much, an endoskeleton that has a liquid metal? That's too much, an anti-terminator terminator! Gimme a break! And, of course Earl Boen makes a cameo as Dr. Silverman, also, alas... as a laughing stock. The only thing good here were special effects, the special effects were even better than anything else here. Money down the drain... don't watch it...",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
219,theinaniloquent,"""The machines will rise""",6,5 November 2011,"John Connor is now in his 20's, and a female terminator, called T-X or Terminatrix, is after him. Another T-101 is sent back through time to protect John once again on the verge of the rise of the machines.The first, original Terminator redefined action. The special effects were ahead of it's time, and the infamous James Cameron gave us what we wanted; something new. Everything was amazing. Then we had Terminator 2, which roundhouse kicked the original in the face. Everything was improved, from the acting to the action, and takes it's place as the best action sci-fi; ever. Then in 2003, a new director tries to revive the beautiful insanity of James Cameron. And as another review states; a good, but flawed, attempt at reviving James Cameron's masterpieces. And it could not be said better. The film starts out amazingly, I had high expectations in the first place. Then shortly after, you can tell the atmosphere has definitely changed... First off, the director tried feeding the film a slight dosage of humor. It some cases it works but others it is cringe-worthy. The action may considered over-the-top in some cases but the redeeming qualities include the infamous crane scene. Then we have the similarities to it's predecessor. Although not exactly the same thing, many things have noticeably been copied of T2. Example: Why was Arnold the protector of John Connor again? Why couldn't they have added some other mission for him; something original. Nevertheless, it still isn't a big factor to it's score. Then after reviewing it's bad qualities, the film does have it's times where you end up liking it.

This third installment Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is one heck of a lot smarter than the second film and maybe just as smart as the first, it is much funnier and the acting is better than I thought was possible with Arnold Swchartzenegger(Or how ever you spell it) in a lead roll. It may not by quite as fun as the original but it passes up the second. The screenplay has much wittier dialogue than the films before and the characters are better developed. The direction isn't James Cameron but is still quite good. The visual effects are some of the best I have ever seen, they are fantastic. A lot better than I could have hoped for, watch it.

222,rparham,A pleasant surprise,7,14 July 2003,"Terminator 3:  Rise of the Machines was a film that had the potential to be a complete disaster.  The second sequel to a well-respected action film, lacking the presence of it's superstar original director (James Cameron), and the most recent film from an aging and recently hit-free action star (Arnold Schwarzenegger).  This is not to mention the 10+ year gap between this film and it's previous entry.  However, when the lights go down, Terminator 3 surprises.  It is, while hardly a masterpiece, an entertaining and engaging piece of action cinema, and perhaps the best action film of the year to date.Most people are familiar with the basic outline of the plot, which this sequel once again follows:  John Connor (Nick Stahl, replacing Edward Furlong), the future leader of the human resistance against the machines that conquer the world, is ""living off the grid"", with no phone number, no address, no attachments.  However, even though he believes that the future is safe after the destruction of the nascent supercomputer Skynet in Terminator 2, he still feels he should live in the shadows.  He is right. Skynet has once again decided to take a crack at eliminating his future adversary, and has sent back a new killing machine, the T-X (Kristanna Loken), to stop the future from turning out poorly for those composed of chips and software.  And, once again, the human resistance has decided to blow the dust off an obsolete model of human-killing metal, the T-101, who comes equipped with the rock-jawed visage of one Austrian body-builder.  He must protect not only Connor, but his future right-hand woman, Kate Brewster (Claire Danes), who is a little, um, reluctant, to believe she will lead the human race in a post-apocalyptic future to victory against sentient machines.  And she doesn't even get to take a pill to determine her fate.Where the film succeeds is in it's realization that it is, first and foremost, an action film.  It isn't interested in being much more than that, but it also is smart enough to not over-reach. It is fast-paced and well-constructed, and it handles itself effectively, full of action, but not seemingly over-done.  The film gets off to great start early on, with a spectacular multi-vehicle chase that rivals the Matrix Reloaded for sheer speed and audacity.  Featuring police cruisers, ambulances and a giant mobile crane, it is a stand-out sequence that few action films this year can really top.Jonathan Mostow, the director, has some big shoes to fill, replacing the ""King of the World"", but he takes charge of the film well, allowing it all to flow effectively.  One major element of the film's success is the performance of Kristanna Loken as the T-X.  Like Robert Patrick before her, she is effectively distant, giving her T-X a cold demeanor belied by her rather comely exterior.  She gives the character a fluid sense of motion that is half animal, half machine.  And, while some may have believed that having a female antagonist would be destined to fall into the bimbo or super-bitch category, the screenwriters have crafted some scenes that display the value of a female killing machine in a male dominated world (a scene where police officer pulls her over and she uses her liquid metal exterior to craft larger breasts is one example).  She is every bit Schwarzenegger's match.And speaking of the aforementioned superstar, Schwarzenegger is able to shake off his recent failures and is back in top form with Terminator 3.  He fits the role perfectly again, and this time the screenwriters have decided to have some fun with him, giving him some neat one-liners that are, unlike seemingly similar material in the abysmal Batman & Robin, genuinely funny. The character is not a self-parody, but a little looser than before.One aspect that put Terminator 2 over the top in terms of memorability was it's then ground-breaking use of computer animation to craft it's villain, and it would be reasonable to assume Terminator 3 would try to top it. However, Mostow and crew have realized that they can't really compete with what has come recently, and don't even try.  This works beautifully though. Instead of being distracted by constant bombardment of eye-candy, the film rides on it's stunt sequences and action set-pieces, and this is the right approach I think.  There are visual effects on display here, and they are expertly well-done, and pretty seamlessly integrated into the film. 
Terminator 3 is not a film that will redefine cinema as we have come to know it, and has it's occasional gaps in logic and credibility, but nothing so glaring that it is distracting.  It simply does the job it was designed to do, and does it well.  What more can an audience ask.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
223,general-melchett,"Full of action and high-tech gadgets, Terminator 3 is very enjoyable - a worthy addition to the Terminator trilogy.",8,17 December 2006,"Terminator 3 was very enjoyable - it was just like its two predecessors except more modern, high-tech, and with a far bigger budget. Instead of just being a high-tech action flick which forgot entirely about the Terminator plot and only had the characters and situations it invented (and no new scenarios), this film continues the Terminator legacy with a new character (the T-X, who is female and far more high-tech than Arnie), a new plot and the promise of a rather uncertain future for John Connor. It isn't a classic and certainly not the most critically well-received of the Terminators, but it manages to bring the golden oldies into the 21st century and make over $400 million in the process.I have to say this - I enjoyed it. Big explosions, exploding cars and robots and guns (and anything to do with action) are certainly my thing, and this film had no shortage of them. The superbly high-tech T-X was rather squarely acted, but she had cunning and villainy and was a hugely menacing villain. The Terminator himself becomes an ally of John Connor this time round (which most people certainly weren't predicting), and he sacrifices himself to let John Connor and Katherine Brewster live - he is the main hero this time. The ending is surprisingly powerful and meaningful, and ensures that this film is more than just standard action fare - it is part of the Terminator series in its own right and deserves to be remembered as a part of this monumental film legacy.On the whole - Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines isn't going to be remembered as a classic, but bad robots, cunning villains and so-called ""vital to the Earth"" human characters ensure that this film is a Terminator. Explosions and death galore - this is hugely enjoyable. Spiffing! 8/10",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
224,Mr_Censored,Apparently There is Fate.,7,17 December 2009,"When a sequel comes along 12 years after the fact, it is almost always met with cynicism and scrutiny. Never has the case been truer than with ""Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines."" The fact of the matter is that the two films before it redefined the science fiction genre in their own time, and the question loomed about whether or not a third film was warranted or even logical. Afterall, we saw the Connor clan in ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" take down Skynet in its infancy stages, thus preventing Judgment Day, right? To quote the T-800's infamous gun-shop dialogue from the original ""Terminator"" film: ""Wrong.""With original creator James Cameron completely out of the picture, director Jonathan Mostow takes the reins with Arnold Schwarzenegger returning to his titular role once more before settling in as the Governator of California. John Connor, the future leader of the resistance, is played by Nick Stahl this time around as we follow the character at age 22, with the world on the brink of the nuclear fall-out at the hands of Skynet. As before, a T-800 is sent back to ensure his survival, as well as that of his future wife (played by Claire Danes) while another, far more advanced female Terminator is sent back to ensure Connor is taken out of the picture and Judgment Day goes on as planned.One thing the film is missing for certain is James Cameron's touch. To be fair, Mostow is a thoroughly competent action director, but there's a sense of ""been there, done that"" with most of the story that makes the proceedings rather stale. You could chalk that up to poor writing, but also because its predecessor leaves the story with nowhere to go. Until it reaches the end, ""Terminator 3"" just sort of meanders along, waiting to reach that moment where all is redeemed and John Connor finally is forced to accept his destiny. Having said that, though, there are some excellent action scenes to fill the time with therefore the film never gets boring or loses its pacing.The film has been somewhat maligned for its humor, but it's important to note that it's not anymore of a comedy than ""Terminator 2"" was. Quite contrary, the bulk of the film is rather dark and brooding, and goes a long way in ensuring the correct mood and tone is established. There's also some key imagery in the film that makes it somewhat iconic. One scene early on during John's opening dialogue cuts to an ocean floor lined with human skulls and will send chills down your spine, as will the somber ending, which in the end, makes the film. Overall, ""Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines"" is definitely a worthy entry in the series, and in spite of its redundancy, manages to entertain as well as push forward the mythology of the franchise.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
225,Dragonsouls,Great Script won't let down Terminator fans.,7,9 July 2003,"I thought T3 would not be the same because Cameron was not involved. Mostow did a great job of staying close to keeping that Cameron look and dark feel but it wasn't the same.  I asked my self that they better come up with a good script, I thought the last pieces of evidence destroyed in T2? isn't Arnold too old and out of shape for the role? I was not dissapointed. Arnold was as jacked as ever, this is his definitive role and what he's known for and is as good as he was in T2, however he was the best in the original. Writing was excellent. The dialogue was ok, except for the many comedy lines which were uncalled for.      The action never let's up until the greatest old school action  chase scene ends. Yes i did see Matrix reloaded but it was too cartoonish, I hate when movies overuse Cgi, nothing has the feel of ""real"" car models and ""real"" stunts. I did not move to the edge of my seat until midway point. Critics keep bashing the movie because it set up for a potential T4. Who cares? why not make another movie if you can write a good screenplay like this. It's not possible to dislike great writing unless you like hating on good things.      The acting was superb. Nick Stahl surprised me, did a good job of making you beleive he is an older Ed Furlong. Clare Danes was impressive and basically played a similar role as Linda Hamilton did with Sara Connor. Newcomer Kristanna Loken also did a good job of recreating Patrick's T-1000 role. She wasn't as advanced, she has a metal skeleton but is full of gadgets. I guess the machines realized since the T-1000 failed, they decided to send back a T-X. Why do the humans keep sending old model primitive T-101's to protect Connor? I guess it's because he can relate to humans the most, I guess he is like a machine with a soul.       This movie had to be made. I know Terminator fans would love to see how the machines first start taking over humanity and T3 Rise of the machines keeps the prestige and greatness of the Terminator franchise. Too bad Cameron did not direct it but it's not as big a deal as I thought.  **** stars out of 4.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

The opening showing the war is really cool for an opening.I like John in this film like the idea of him being of the grid and in hiding because he is scared of the future and dosent want Judgement Day to happen.
I also really like the idea of Judgement Day being inevitable.The ending is great with Judgement Day happening and they get John save it was a good twist to end on and really turned the original stories on their heads with Judgment Day always destined to happen and John becoming the leader.Some fun actions scenes the main problem I have is the story is not as good as the first two movies and some of the cgi is noticeable.
I also dont like that they killed Sarah Conner of between movies it's such a shame she wasn't in this one.Still a fun action and a very underrated sequel in the Terminator series.Verdict 8/10 fun movie with great action and a cool twist ending not as good or as iconic as the first two movie's but very underrated in my opinion.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

I waited until the movie came to video stores and then I rented it. I was not prepared for one of the worst pieces of garbage cinema I have ever seen. I could go on and on about how horrible this movie was. First of all, whoever wrote the script needs to be executed. This is prime example of what not to do. Second, the whole storyline was bogus and highly unoriginal. I was so hoping to see a futuristic waist land like how they should in the first two films and to officially see the war against the machines. Instead, they gives a load of horses---. Third, the acting was so atrocious that I could feel my brain cells leaking out of my head. Fourth, not even Arny himself could make this a fun movie. I admit that I like his silly catch phrases but it just didn't work in this film. For instance, instead of saying ""I'll Be Back"" like in the other films he says after a fight with the T-X ""She'll be Back"". Need I say more.

230,TheOny13,Half T2 half the actual movie that was intended,7,10 September 2020,"And what I'm referring to here is that the Terminator formula only works a couple of times. For example it worked in Terminator 1 when the relationship between the guardian sent back and the person was one of love. Then in the sequel it was about a father son relationship. So here... what is it about? Well, it's just a Terminator coming back to protect John Connor. And instantly you get the feeling you've seen that done before and done better. The other half of the movie though is what the movie was supposed to be, all about the Judgment Day and the Rise of The Machines. But that is superficially explored. Mainly because the movie is so preoccupied with replicating T2 that it forgets how to be original and compelling. I'll be going briefly through the plot in order to pin point some of the things that worked and some that didn't.Plot Breakdown:The movie kicks off with John Connor on the run. On the run from what you might ask? Well, he's just on the run because that is cool and makes for an interesting character right? Wrong, instantly the character has 0 motivation and very low likability, because you don't know why he is running (there are no terminators yet hunting him) or if he has any character trait to make him in any way interesting. Then we meet the two terminators from this movie T-X and another Arnold, because why not? It's a Terminator movie after all. And we're instantly given the clue on who's good and who's bad. Remember T2 when you didn't know which one was protecting John and which one was trying to kill him? And then in a great twist in the scene from the mal we learn who's who. That was a good movie. I liked that! So T-X goes to capture John and Katherine Brewster and kill them but Arnold stops her. Then there's a car chase only without the thrills of the T2 motorcycle-car chase. Then T-X kills Katherine's fiance because why not? She doesn't try to get info from him disguised in someone else, to maybe find out where Katherine is. Nah, she just kills him and takes his image. Then goes with a couple policeman to meet Kathie and when she gets off the car she immediately changes back from her fiance to her standard image. I was: ""What? Why?"" Why would she give up her cover and not try to get closer to Kathie as her fiance and then kill her? I have to admit Kathie realized something was off with her fiance immediately after T-X got out of the car but still it's a pretty dumb scene to be honest. So they fight T-X again, and Arnold along with John and Kathie escape yet again. Then they go on about Judgment Day and how that is inevitable. Gotta say that scene was pretty awesome. It has good dialogue and very nice lines from both John Connor and the Terminator. It ends with them going to Kathie's father who is a general in the US Air Force to stop them from activating Skynet. But they're too late, Skynet gets activated and then there's more terminator fights which at this point are boring. But the end of this movie is the best part. Arnold gets a virus in his system courtesy of T-X and tries to kill John but then fails and he shuts down. John and Kathie escape in a plane to Nevada where they go inside a bunker. Then Arnold and T-X come also, so they have yet another fight in which both get destroyed and then John and Kathie get locked in the bunker and survive the Judgment Day which we get to see happening as the last scene of the movie.End of Plot Breakdown.Gotta say, the concept of the movie, that Judgment Day still happens and that nothing can prevent that was cool. And anything relating to that was pretty awesome. But the execution of the movie is what is lacking here really. The characters are all stale and the acting is pretty bad, especially from the guy playing John Connor. There's almost no character arc to either of the characters. A little might be said about John who goes from a mess to a mess who is in charge of leading the human resistance in the war against the machines. Kathie would have the biggest character arc in which she goes from a pet doctor to a fighting woman taking down a terminator prototype. And speaking of that, anything that had to do with Skynet or terminators prototype I found it to be extremely intriguing. I would have loved the movie to be only about the development of Skynet and how the machines get self aware and the Judgment Day happening. Instead we got a first and a haf act of T2 rehash and then the actual movie that would have been a lot better. Imagine the movie not even being about terminators. Just about a hacker who discovers that the US Army was building an AI and tries to expose them for weaponizing the military, trying to destroy this system only to find out that this system is Skynet actually and that the Military already built prototypes of terminators and then Judgment Day would happen. Imagine how interesting that would have sounded. A movie about a hacker and the US military becoming a terminator sequel in a twisty second half and actually showing Judgement Day happening. That would have made for a much much better and most of all an original movie than rehashing T2 in the first half of the movie. However the things about Judgment Day were nice and I liked anything about the fact that it couldn't be stopped or the activation of Skynet, the terminator prototypes. However the rehash of T2 was pretty bad along with the acting and the story in the first part of the movie. The rest... music, CGI and cinematography were all pretty decent with the standout being the CGI which looked amazing in my opinion. To summarize all, pretty decent film that unfortunately suffers from the syndrome that would later plague the franchise and that is the T2-Syndrome (having the same plot as T2), aside from that there is a great movie lurking inside. Too bad it never got out. 7/10",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
231,kyle-cruse,Far exceeded my expectations,8,29 August 2008,"Generally a second sequel like this would easily be a bomb. Truly, many of the elements of the film do not look positive, right down to Schwartzeneggar playing a different Terminator than the character in the first two films. However, I truly enjoyed watching ""Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines."" This film does not try to fill up the entire story with useless action scenes. Instead, the action sequences are well done and fun to watch. Usually a sequel like this would lack good character development and would not focus on the people in the story enough. I felt there was significant development of the characters here, especially since this film takes place at least ten years after the events in the previous film. This film may seem a little more depressing than the previous two, but it is a lot of fun nonetheless. Schwartzeneggar plays his role just as good as he did many years ago, and I feel this is his swan song to Hollywood. This film has been needlessly criticized, when in reality, there is no reason to expect any more from it. This is a worthwhile and satisfying movie, and I hope that part 4 will pull it off just as well.*** out of ****",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

Arnie is great in this.
Unsure why this film gets so much hate. Of course it's not as good as the first two but it's far far better than Terminator Genisys ......that is a truly terrible film.

234,ilovedolby,`T3' is a relatively good action/science-fiction sequel that holds true to the original concepts that Cameron created.,8,6 July 2003,"Twelve years ago, James Cameron released one of the most successful and visually stunning action/science fiction releases of all time-`Terminator 2: Judgment Day.' Now we have a sequel called `Terminator 3: Rise Of The Machines.' It would seem like another Hollywood action extravaganza without a plot. After all, the characters in `T2' stopped Judgment Day from ever happening, so what's left? Apparently, they only postponed it. So it's once again up to the future resistance of humankind to send back a protector for John Connor and his future wife, Kate Brewster. Although the story line sounds contrived, the filmmakers came up with some good plot concepts in order to continue the series on a level of minor intelligence. The end result is less dark and less hard-core action than James Cameron's direction gave in the first two films. Nonetheless, `T3' is a worthy sequel that has some great action sequences and keeps the story believable. 	`T3' begins in the present day with images of John (Nick Stahl) who lives off the grid in order to keep his existence a secret. At the same time, the machine army of the future sends back a new kind of terminator, the T-X (Kristanna Loken), a female whose mission is to destroy not only John, but also his future lieutenants. As such, the human resistance sends back their own terminator, the T-800 (Arnold Schwarzenegger), the model designed to protect John and his future spouse, Kate (Claire Danes). Here's the catch. Kate's father, Robert Brewster (David Andrews) is the man who heads up the computer network Skynet. But what he doesn't realize is that Skynet, a form of artificial intelligence, is becoming self-aware. In other words, as soon as Skynet is brought online, it will take over computer networks and mainframes worldwide, and the war will begin. It's now a race to stop not only the T-X from destroying the crucial members of the future human resistance, but also a race to stop Skynet from coming online.	`T3' had some great action sequences. In particular, a chase scene in which the T-X tries to run down John and Kate with a huge crane truck, as the T-800 hangs on by the crane. The T-X crashes the truck into the sides of buildings and other vehicles in order to stop the terminator from saving John and Kate. As absurd as the scene is, it leads to an incredible crash that will leave one's jaw on the floor of the theater in awe.	Jonathan Mostow took over the direction of `The Terminator' series, as it was the brainchild of `Titanic' director James Cameron. Mostow's credits include the heart-pounding suspense thriller `Breakdown,' and the World War II submarine flick `U-571.' Mostow's direction is not as hard edged as Cameron's was, but it is certainly respectable. Usually, as the founding filmmaker of a project leaves, the new director may ruin the legacy left by the original filmmaker-a problem that existed with `Jurassic Park III.' Steven Spielberg portrayed an image filled with suspense and intrigue into the dinosaur world created by author Micheal Crichton. However, when Joe Johnston (`October Sky') took over as the director, he created a simple, campy film that couldn't even compare to the greatness of its predecessors.	It's great to see Schwarzenegger back in action, as well. He was made to be the hero in these kinds of films. And `T3' is a far cry better than his last flick, `Collateral Damage.' In the end, `T3' is a relatively good action/science-fiction sequel that holds true to the original concepts that Cameron created. ***",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

This movie will live in the trilogy.  It follows the story line enough that the true Terminator fans can make the easy predictions as far as what's going to happen or be said next, but Ms Loken does exactly what the character is supposed to do: keep coming until the job is finished.Arnold, on the other hand, once again, plays the good guy in this film.  And although I could not see him as a bad guy like he was in the first Terminator, he was a good guy who could make it believable!  Nick Stahl is an unknown to me.  I have never seen him perform before, to my knowledge, but his character portrayal is not bad!  The whole film plot is enough to make someone think, though, about two things:  1) The events that lead to the eventual destruction of mankind, & 2) the fact that someone's destiny can be changed, but weather the timeline can follow pretty much the same path or not.Sci fi strikes again in the summer of 2003.

The Terminatrix doesn't really come off although Kristianna Loken tries her best.In all this is a hugely disappointing experience for people that have followed Terminator films so far.It has some great standalone action sequences but as a whole is a lazy retread that indulges parody and comedy far too much divorcing itself from the serious tone set by the previous two films.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
238,lotus_chief,A disgrace to the Terminator franchise.,7,18 August 2003,"Terminator 3......hmm.I saw this film reluctantly; after learning that James Cameron was not going to be involved, I immediately wrote it off. Being a BIG fan of the first 2 (the first one more), I just knew that this third installment was not going to live up to the excellence of the first 2 films. Well, I was right. Quite frankly, this should not have never been made. Why can't people leave things alone? The Terminator franchise, The Terminator idea, is James Cameron's and he and he ALONE should do these films. It's HIS brainchild, and if he isn't involved, the very idea of doing a sequel without him should be scrapped. But in the end, its all about money, isn't it?With all that said, this movie by itself isn't bad at all. Some pretty good action sequences keep you entertained. I was skeptical about there being a female Terminator, but she was good in her role. As a stand-alone action film, its not bad. But put alongside the first 2 Terminators, T-3 is....well......just 'there'. It's very bland and doesn't have a expand on the story enough to help keep the Terminator franchise in greatness. Essentially, it adds nothing to the saga shown brilliantly by the first 2. This just can't live up to the Terminator name, and has unfortunately tainted the name to some extent. Whose fault is that? Well, it could be the makers of T-3 for even trying to make a sequel, or it could be the first 2 Terminators for being that damn good. Either way, this should never have happened, and I pray to God there isn't a 'T-4'. ** out of **** stars.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

We will have to endure his publicity stunt involving him being Governor of California and we will have to see him try to go back to something that worked for him before. So, here goes Terminator 3. Sadly, the third installment is by far the weakest of the trilogy. The character and the story has been played out. Oh sure, Arnold's character is much more hero-friendly than the the first installment and even second installment. However, as I watched this standard paint by the numbers sci-fi thriller play itself out, I just felt depressed. You are seeing Arnold try to recreate a character that he was close to twenty years ago. Oh sure, it does not take great range to do so, but still. Perhaps it is naive to expect Arnold to have matured a little bit in his acting career. However, I guess we will not see that Clint Eastwood maturation.

240,MF210,One of the better summer movies,8,18 September 2003,"My Rating: *** out of ****.Ok, Terminator 3 is unnecessary but its so enjoyable it makes up for it. It is the weakest of the trilogy and I think a fourh Terminator would not be a good idea. But nevertheless Terminator 3 is one entertaining ride.
The story is pretty much the same as Terminator 2. Most critics and fans saw this as a huge flaw. But I did not mind it at all, Terminator 2 is one of the best sci-fi/action films and I wouldn't mind if the sequel did it again. The acting is mixed. Arnold Schwarzenneger is excellent here, he has this role down. Kristiana Loken is playing the TX, her performance is showing a lack of emotion and having an evil stare, which she does quite well. Claire Danes is fine, but I have never been a big fan of her. However, Nick Stahl terrible, he comes off like a wuss instead of a future hero.
The action is quite impressive here. Theres a fight scene between the TX and The Terminator thats fantastic. The only part of the action I didnt like was the chase scene, I found it kind of overblown. Terminator 3 is well-paced and will keep you interested throughout. Some people complain the humor was too much. Some of the humor may be a little much, but I thought some was quite funny.

242,lagriff05,"Solid, if very unnecessary.",7,27 June 2009,"This Terminator movie continues in the line of classics by starting off very similar to how the first two did - opening with our main characters, and then introducing a Terminator, appearing in the nude and obtaining clothing and a vehicle quickly. This whole film can kind of be likened to a past-his-prime wrestler trying to overcompensate for his age, as it does kind of seem to be riding on the trends set by the first two...but hey, it's the goddamn Terminator, and this movie is entertaining as hell.Okay, okay, this movie is very unnecessary and goes against every moral the original two Terminator movies stood on. It takes a 180 from the moral of the last two, which was that you can choose your own destiny, and now apparently says that you CANNOT do that. I guess nine years off changes a film's direction a bit.I think another weird thing about this is that the Terminator series has always balanced humor with serious moments, but this movie is way darker than the others in thematic alone, with a more bleak outlook in general. The others were sort of hopeful in their darkness and chaos, with a light to guide our heroes out of it, and an overall triumphant feel, but this one is just dark and depressing. As such, the humor is a lot more vibrant and stupid this time around, clearly trying to lighten the mood of the overwrought plot.But really, this is just all about the high-octane fist-pumping action scenes, which are maybe a little more dragged out, but they still draw the viewer in with skill and class, with the first half of the movie being unbelievably good at it.

243,mgruebel,Better if you're not too familiar with 1 & 2,6,30 July 2015,"This is actually a pretty good action flick. The director spends some time on characterization, the chemistry between characters is pretty good, and there are plenty of amazing chase scenes (that crane truck seemed to lose more wheels than could possibly be on one when it crashed!), android action, etc.The real problem with the film is ""more of the same."" We already had a Terminator movie with a shape-changing robot pursuing a human hero protected by an older model electromechanical robot with a human skin surface. So now the hero is in his twenties instead of his teens. So what. The movie felt more like a reboot of Terminator 2, but without the masterful touch of Cameron. Not to criticize Jonathan Mostow too much: it is well-directed.The gruff ""I'm reluctantly getting to like you"" chemistry between Nick Stahl (as the human here) and Claire Danes (as his future wife) works well. Comic relief is provided in well-times doses, such as when Arnold Schwarzenegger (the good robot) informs Danes that she will have Stahl's babies in the near future, at a time when she is decidedly in the ""reluctant"" phase of the relationship. There are also nice cinematic devices, such as the gradual progression from night to twilight to dawn to day during the first big chase. Very expertly done.The movie has a lot of little plot holes, many of them associated with the idea of doing the same thing a third time over. If the machines of the future can send three terminators back, why not even more all over the place? And why is a machine as cold-blooded and efficient as the icy-beautiful Kristanna Loken so inefficient at doing its job? If you need to change from ""boyfriend"" to ""Terminatrix"" before you can use your weapon on Dane, just stay ""boyfriend,"" get next to Dane, then wring her little neck! However, none of the holes are absolutely critical to the plot, which sails along just fine to a climax at an accelerator and a US deep cover installation.I'd say for someone not into the Terminator series, this would be a ""7"" action flick. For someone who adored Arnold and Cameron since 1984's first installment, it'll probably be a 5 for deja vu, seen that done better. So I'll award the average of these scores.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

In fact, I remember several times thinking that I couldn't look away even for a moment afraid of what I would miss. That's the definition of action in my book.Unlike a lot of action movies, it wasn't just mindless mayhem. Each individual scene had a point --- in addition to the mindless mayhem. I even liked the plot quite a bit. Logical. And, I love movies that mess with the time line as long as it makes sense.The other nice thing about T-3 is that it set us up for T-4, T-5, etc. I don't know exactly how Arnold is going to do it since by the time he gets out of politics, he won't look anywhere near as chiseled and it will be hard to believe he is the best the robots have to offer.

245,BrickNash,Good action film but pointless and tasteless re-tread of T2,5,2 January 2013,"Terminator 3, the brave, brave sequel to what is considered by many to be the perfect film, and with that fact alone it was bound to fail. However, was it all bad?The film does indeed have many good points. The special effect and CGI are superb, crisp, and believable with what looks like early Transformers type effects in there. The action scenes can't be faulted, with the now famous crane scene being a pretty stunning set-piece, and every fight and high adrenaline piece is made with every professionalism. The film has had a lot of money thrown at it, and it shows.Casting wise, Nick Stahl turns in a good performance as John Conner and is quite likable in the role. Of course nothing can hide the fact that re-casting a pivotal character causes some pretty major disconnect, and I think had Edward Furlong reprised his role it would have made for a better viewing experience. This is in no way a slight on Stahl's performance, but continuity and familiarity is important when doing a series.Claire Danes is fine, but suffers from nothing to do with her acting skill. Kate Brewster just isn't that much of a character to play, but she does well with what she has and what little time she had to prepare.All this goodness however doesn't take away from the fact that Terminator 3 is really just a copy of it's predecessor. The story follows pretty much an identical plot, and the retreading of key scenes from T2 but done with 'humour' really does sour the experience.However, the biggest flaw surely must be that the film takes the philosophy, effort and loss of the first two films and renders them completely pointless. Everything James Cameron tried to say has been taken back and replaced with a ""Sorry, the first two films were wrong, this is how it is!""The best part of the film is when Skynet becomes self-aware and we are treated to early versions of Terminators and H-K's. However, this is over far too quickly, and you are left with a severe feeling of being had by lazy writers and greedy studios. The ""Rise of the Machines"" part does happen, but it's a case of blink and you'll miss it.I don't blame Johnathan Mostow though. This film has studio interference written all over it, and they were obviously pulling the strings. However, if you were a relatively unknown director and someone offered you the chance to get paid a shitload of money to direct a Terminator film you wouldn't turn it down, no matter what these idiot fanboys claim they would do for the purity of the series.A few years ago I would have said this was the worst of the Terminator films, but with the release of the by-the-numbers Genisys I think T3 is a well made and entertaining, but ultimately flawed and predictable entry into the franchise.I always end up watching T3 it when I go on a Terminator binge and it's fine for killing a couple of hours, but given the meddling of the story, the re-casting, and the general lack of originality, I just don't really count it as canon.The James Cameron directed ""T2: Battle Across Time"" from 1996 is the closest thing you'll get to a proper sequel. Not only does it reunite the original T2 cast, but seeing the Terminator and John Connor go FORWARD in time to Terminate Skynet (essentially turning the idea of the first films on it's head) would have made a great film in it's own right.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

Unlike the two previous movies, this one spans only one day. And what a day it is. We have here a total commitment to special effects and explosions instead of any character development or plot. Arnold looks damn good nearly twenty years after the original film, to his credit, and his acting is, well, predictably Arnold. In both T2 and T3, he breaks the machine character in several scenes and uses ""human"" tones and expressions when communicating with the real humans. Claire Danes' character is never really developed beyond the confused girl and veterinary assistant about to be married to a man she is not quite sure she wants to marry, although there is one fairly comedic scene where John Connor looks at her and says ""You remind me of my mother."". Earl Boen reprising his role as Dr. Silberman is priceless, especially when he spots the Terminator. Nick Stahl as John Connor just does not pan out. Edward Furlong in the second movie figured out the true nature of the character when the Terminator explains his mother has been telling the truth. We watch a transition from angry kid to the potential leader of the resistance. Stahl remains the man in denial of his destiny right up to the end. Kristanna Loken never breaks character, she is the perfect Terminator, driven, relentless and uncaring. There are some other inconsistencies, mostly the hit list T-X is following in Los Angeles, which would seem to be unnecessary since LA will be one of the cities wiped out when Judgment Day occurs. But to the credit of the art department, the special effects alone in this film are worth a look.

I always felt that T2 was nowhere nearly as good as the original, but the amazing special effects blinded everyone to the fact. In T3 it is an absolute Joy to see Arnold back in his most famous role, he's absolutely fantastic in this film. He looks great too, he's obviously been back in the gym for this one. Director Jonathon Mostow does a great job filling Camerons shoes and the supporting cast are great, the actor playing John Connor is much more likeable than whiney Ed Norton, and Claire Danes gets better and better as the film progresses, but all in all this film belongs to Arnold, the only down point for me was the lack of the familiar Terminator music from the last two films, anyway welcome back Arnie, roll on T4.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

Utter s***, to be precise.This movie's nothing like T1 or T2.It's just lame. Especially the female terminator. This was such absurd. That woman, whoever she is, can't even act. Why did they have to bring her in? The story is ridiculous, messy, and totally boring. It was completely unnecessary. If you can't come up with a compelling story, then why make a sequel in the first place?? The characters are cheesy, dull, and unlikeable. You don't want to see more than 10 minutes of these idiots, let alone root for any of them.Oh, and... I thought this movie was made just to show off the special effects and impressive action sequences, which the movie was supposed to have (since there was no story or anything), but even that was s***! The special effect in T1 are better, for Pete's sake! And all the ""action"" is just lame. Honestly, there's no suspense at all, and when the terminators fight -- it's just ridiculous (like the rest of the meaningless ""action"" in this movie"").T1 was good. T2 was perfect. T3... I'll just keep pretending it never existed.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

250,saarvardi,One of the best finales I personally have ever seen on the big screen,10,11 April 2007,"One of the most profound childhood memories I will always remember was seeing Terminator 2 on the big screen. The scope of the plot, the groundbreaking effects, and of course  the one and only Arnold Schwarzenegger, than at the prime of his cinematic career  created a larger than life experience that made me tremble like the little kid I was at the time.Naturally, I was one of those very eager fan boys that looked forward to the third installment of the series upon its release 12 year later, and unlike many of those  I wasn't disappointed with the final result that unfolded before me on screen. Sure, the story seemed somewhat rushed at times, and the basic plot contradicted the final conclusion of the previous film; but once you get over the initial frustration from this sudden change of arc, you're in for one very intense action ride.While the plot here is similar to that of the previous films  with one Terminator sent to the past to kill off the future resistance against the machines and the other sent back to protect humanity's last chance  what's good about this film is that we actually get to see how Judgment Day actually occurs, with the final 10-15 minutes of the film being one of the best finales I personally have ever seen on the big screen. Once you realize that this time its for real, and the events have been set to begin the greatest attack ever set against mankind, you get that tingling feeling back inside  the one you got upon viewing T1 & T2. This unique and special feeling, and this alone, is worth the perfect 10 I give Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
251,Jamie_Seaton,Hmm not as good as the first and second,8,25 August 2009,"don't worry people, i do think its still brilliant and carries on the story well. it just didn't have the intelligence like the first two films. we all know its because James Cameron didn't direct this one. still its a brilliant all out action science fiction film that does keep the story fresh.i do think this one is a little more cheesier than the first two films, just in little scenes. nothing major. i gotta say i loved the CGI in this, the graphics were immense and really kept me on the edge of my seat. it really is a very good third instalment that should be watched by allonce again i'll have to say Arnold Schwarzenegger did a very good job as playing the terminator and Nick Stahl (carnivale, sin city) played a good John Conner as well. Clair Danes isn't so bad even though i don't rate her in anything else. Kristanna Loken plays pretty well as the TX machine sent back in time to kill various important people and obviously John Connerall in all this is a brilliant third part and everyone who has seen the first two should watch this one too......... 8.5/10..........j.d Seaton",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
252,Idiot-Deluxe,"Yeah, because everything after T2 is just great. And here's where it began.",3,26 March 2017,"Arnie was ill-advised to make this one.... if logic or integrity meant anything that is.When it comes to The Terminator franchise, it's like this: No James Cameron = No Good..... and one of them doesn't even have Arnold!Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines, the third chapter in the Terminator saga (which should have NEVER been made in the first place) hit the theaters in the summer of 2003, a whole twelve years after Terminator 2: Judgement Day (the best Terminator movie) and not surprisingly it predictably proved to be a very disappointing sequel. But why? First of all the whole premise of the movie seems forced and illogical, if you're at all familiar with the ending of the second film, the very existence of a third Terminator film is absolutely nonsensical. But at the time (the 2000's) most of Arnie's movies were bombing, so in a forced and desperate effort to reverse his sagging box-office appeal, he decided to play his last remaining ace card: The Terminator franchise. And why not, it had always reaped glowing results in the past, however, James Cameron wisely and with clear-headed logic wanted nothing to do with a third Terminator movie. Evidently the director of the first two films hadn't forgotten how the second film ended, but it's star obviously had. And I must say for a physically demanding role like The Terminator time is not an ally; yet Arnold took twelve years off between T2 and T3 and another 12 years between T3 and Genisys..... rust is forming on the Terminator.Let's briefly recap the events of the end of Terminator 2, in the films finale through the actions of John and Sarah Conner, Miles Bennett Dyson and a certain re-programmed T-101, every existing scrap of technology that the franchise is based upon (i.e. Terminators of various models and Skynet) was utterly destroyed when the Cyberdine Building was blown up in a massive explosion; and thus effectively erasing the cause of Judgement Day from existence thereby preventing - The War Against The Machines. Which also at the same time should have logically ruled out any possibility of another sequel. BUT, according to this movies logic, none of that happened... and the best reasoning they could come up with was ""You only postponed it, Judgement Day is inevitable"" and then Arnie proceeds to back up his illogical reasoning with some additional drivel about more Terminator's being sent back in time, that are programmed to seek out and terminate certain people who would eventually go on to become military officers in the future, during The War Against The Machines..... but we.... in the second film.... oh never the hell mind!To be fair and seeing as how this is a Terminator movie there are a few great action scenes, but the films poor casting (in the roles of John Conner and Katherine Brewster) and it's aforementioned ludicrous plot doom it from the get go; and as a result T3 is nothing more than huge, disappointing, illogical mess of a movie - which should never had been made. Another of T3's failings is the films pathetically lame attempts at humor of which almost all fall flat. On the other hand one of T3's few bright spots would have to be Kristanna Loken, she is simply terrific in her role as the ""T-X"" (the bad Terminator), I find her overall design to be absolutely stellar. You'd certainly never suspect such a lovely looking lady would be so fiendishly deadly. And there's another thing about our deadly little Terminatrix, does any else think that Kristanna Loken bares a striking resemblance to 90's porn queen Jenna Jameson?In the end Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is a poorly conceptualized sequel and it represents the first (of several) blemish's to a once great franchise. At the heart of the matter, I can easily conclude that T3 and it's other more recent sequels (which are even worse) are the products of illogical thought, that are powered by nothing other than greed - and perhaps a faulty long-term memory. Why else would they keep making these utterly disgraceful POS sequels. ""Dark Fate"" anyone LOL! BOMB!!!It takes Arnold AND James Cameron BOTH for this to work, the Terminator series ended with the second film, 26 years ago - anything and everything to do with The Terminator beyond that point is nothing but cyber-trash and money motivated box-office greed.Stick to the first two films, they're more memorable and ""more better"" in all ways possible.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
253,senortuffy,Needless addendum to the series.,7,12 November 2003,"This is a fairly entertaining sci-fi action film, but it pales in comparison to the original Terminator movies.  It's lacking in artistic direction and the cast is weak.  James Cameron is a terrific storyteller and takes care of the minutest of details, but here the events just happen without proper sequencing. Jonathon Mostow is in way over his head.  The acting is also a problem.  Arnold is good as the Terminator, but Nick Stahl is very bad in the role of John Connor.  There's nothing heroic about him at all.  Eddie Furlong was a tough kid and you could buy him growing up to be a leader of the humans in the future, but Stahl doesn't suggest anything other than a future 7-11 clerk.  Also, there's no Linda Hamilton character, no strong female lead - Claire Danes brings nothing to the table.  Kristanna Loken is alright as the T-X sent back to kill John Connor, but she isn't required to do much acting what with the computer animators doing most of it for her. Why did they make this movie?  There was nothing left from the second film that needed to be clarified, nothing here clever enough to add to the Terminator myth.  It was made only for the sake of money, but with production costs so high, even that didn't work.As a stand alone film, it's OK entertainment.  There's lots of action and the special effects are good.  There's even some humor written into the script.  But when you look at it in the context of ""T2-Judgement Day"" it's a major disappointment.Thankfully, with Arnold as governor now, we don't have to worry about another sequel.  Even these producers couldn't be stupid enough to make a Terminator 4 without Arnold.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
254,Pavel-8,Enjoy the ride...again.,7,27 July 2003,"**Warning! Mild Spoilers Ahead!**""T-3"" is a straightforward picture, setting the stage in the opening twenty minutes, then propelling its characters into what is basically a chase movie for the final hour and a half. Sound familiar? Well, why mess with success? Although it may sound boring and routine, the movie is neither. The script and pacing are both tight and constantly in motion, leaving no time for boredom.The plot of ""T-3"" is pretty much the same as that of its predecessors. The machines have sent a new and improved terminator, in this case a stunning T-X played by the smokin' Kristanna Loken, back in time from the future to kill someone who will eventually lead the humans in their fight against the machines. Naturally the humans also managed to sneak back their own terminator, albeit an older model, the T-800. This is of course Arnold Schwarzenegger (although not the same robot as in T-2), and he must prevent the T-X from accomplishing her mission.What separates ""T-3"" from lighter summer fare such as ""Pirates"" or ""The Italian Job"" is the effective philosophy. While not quite up to the high standard of ""T-2"" or ""The Matrix"", it still churns the mind with its issues of fate and time travel. Go ahead, try to completely figure out how a machine from the future can go back in time to affect events that ultimately create the machine itself. Despite the density, every event that takes place makes perfect sense both within the movie and within the trilogy.
Schwarzenegger is once again at his best, as the simple-minded and stoic T-800. He slides easily back into the character, and even at age 56 is still a perfect physical and vocal fit. Some say that the role doesn't demand much of Arnold, but perhaps he does it so effortlessly that we don't notice. Either way, seeing him back at the top of his acting game is a pleasure, after such mediocre fare as ""Collateral Damage"" and ""The 6th Day"".
Nick Stahl, no longer ""In the Bedroom"", fits into the part of a twenty-something John Connor with ease. He provides Connor with the proper world-weariness and gives him grounded logic and street smarts that befit someone who has grown up under his unusual circumstances.
Loken, much like Robert Patrick in the second movie, doesn't get to display much versatility, but her icily gorgeous eyes and facial features combine with appropriate body movements to supply the T-X with a chilly and imposing aura. She's not quite as fearsome as Patrick, perhaps because she's female; but her character's unstoppable nature is enough to compensate for that.
Claire Danes, in a role that one might not expect to find her, is Kate Brewster. She happens upon Connor at her veterinary clinic, and is properly naive, much like Neo in ""The Matrix"", as she gets sucked into the tidal wave of action and adventure. The rest of the actors, in mostly little-developed parts, are sufficient to round out the cast.The comedy in ""T-3"" was an unexpected enjoyment. Much of it was derived from Schwarzenegger's machine mind failing to comprehend various aspects of humanity, verbal and otherwise. Arnold's classic monotone delivery is perfect, both in tone and timing. Other comedic sources included a number of references to the prior films. Some are obvious (""She'll be back""); some are less so (the reappearing shrink). But they are all amusing, providing necessary comic relief for a movie that could easily have been overbearing and overly serious. One other amusing theme is the one-upmanship involved in various stunts and chase scenes. Things just keep getting bigger, and I couldn't help but laugh. ""T-3"" wasn't bust-a-gut funny, but it consistently induced chuckling from the audience in a number of ways.
One of the joys of ""T-3"" is the physicality of the stunt and fight sequences. Because of the virtual immortality of the two terminators, brutal acts of violence are necessary when fighting them, acts that can't be done to normal humans. There's something painfully (sadistically?) enjoyable about watching someone bashing a foe with a just-ripped-off-the-wall urinal, or seeing a truck slam straight into a building. I found myself constantly wincing, but also grinning at the same time. Seeing someone get the crap beat out of them while knowing the characters won't actually be injured is surprisingly, perhaps frighteningly, engrossing. Additionally, those scenes appear to be mostly stuntwork, not CGI. Contrasting the highway chase scene in ""Matrix Reloaded"", which is gloriously sleek and jaw-dropping, the car chase in ""T-3"" is brutal and punishing. In a cinematic time that favors heavy reliance on computer imagery, that honest physicality in stuntwork is extremely refreshing.This is a movie that should be seen on the big screen, preferably one with a high quality surround sound system. The theater I patronized was unfortunately lacking in the aural department, as the audio was front-heavy. But I still appreciated the sound. Without being overly loud, the sound effects did their job quite well, providing the proper noises at the proper times. The score was not very noticeable, which means that composer Marco Beltrami did his job suitably. Somewhat surprisingly, the recognizable Terminator theme of Brad Fiedel did not surface until the end of the movie (unless I missed it).The other reason I recommend the theater experience is the bigness of the flick.  Like its prequels, ""T-3"" is simply a large movie. Arnold is big; various vehicles are big; themes are big; everything is done on a grand scale. Plus the picture looks good. With machines as a primary subject, the film is conducive to a slick appearance, and cinematographer Don Burgess (""Cast Away"", ""Bourne Identity"") delivers a gleaming final cut.
If you haven't seen the first two renditions, you'll definitely miss out on some of the jokes, and won't have a full understanding of everything discussed, but you can still enjoy the film. I recommend seeing the other two first, but it's not entirely necessary. The presence of Kate, also a newbie to the world of terminators, allows John Connor and the T-800 to explain much of the backstory without seeming dry. Taking a cue from the original, most of the exposition wisely occurs on the run, so it doesn't slow the movie down, but rather fills in the blanks of the plot while still moving forward.Not comparing ""T-3"" to its predecessors is impossible. This one isn't quite as cultish as the first, nor as dark or ground-breaking as the second. However ""T-3"" is still a thoroughly worthy and engaging finale (?) to the series.Bottom Line: The issue of fate combined with the spectacular action sequences make this an above average flick. Terminator fans should be pleased too. Worth a big screen viewing and surprisingly enjoyable. Three of four stars for now.  Maybe more as it grows on me.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
255,the_oak,This film is a disgrace,1,3 April 2006,"I have been a fan of Schwarzenegger for many years, and I have even money on him becoming president at odds 500/1. However, his last good film was True Lies. After this he had made a lot of garbage, probably being topped off with the enigma that is Terminator 3. What do you get when you have a lame script, a mediocre director and a lead actor that is not as hip as he used to be? The answer is a lame film. Another viewer rated the scene where he gets his clothes off a homosexual stripper a good one. I think it was very stupid, and totally destroyed any credibility that the terminator had built up in the first two outings. The rise of the machines and the almost total destruction of human kind is not a subject to me made fun of, and it is very sad that they did not understand this when they made T3. The T3 script is a mess. It is as if the script for Terminator 2 was a vase but it fell to the floor and broke and then a group of retards tried to glue the pieces together. I am a fan of Nick Stahl, and he was in my opinion one of the few that did a good job here. This is just very sad.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
256,chvylvr80,Worthy addition to the series,7,10 July 2003,"Terminator 3 continues to offer great sci-fi action in the tradition of it's predecessors. Arnold is starting to look a little old but he still fits in arguably the best role of his career. Nick Stahl as John Connor continues Eddie Furlong's tradition of being an annoying brat that you wish the Terminator would stop protecting. Claire Danes isn't given much to do, and the T-X is both beautiful and deadly. The movie delivers as far as great effects and action sequences are concerned but tends to lag when the story focuses on John. Overall it's something that should be seen in the theaters, all the summer blockbusters should. Bottom Line: It's a good flick and the DVD promises to be filled with extras.

257,caseynicholson,Shocked By How Much I Liked This Twelve Years Later!,8,29 August 2015,"I remember being very disappointed when this movie came out. The first two Terminator movies have always been some of my favorite movies, or at least they were when I was more of a youth. Indeed, for many years I would have said that ""T2: Judgment Day"" was my favorite film.I guess I've grown up a fair bit since then, because I've been watching the series this past week, and while I still have a great love for T1, T2 failed to impress me the way I imagined it would after not having seen it for several years. And then tonight I got around to ""Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines"". I prepared myself to be let down. This is, after all, the worst of the series (I still haven't seen Salvation or Genesis). So I settled in waiting to be unimpressed.To my great surprise, twelve years after having first watched this film in the theater, I found this movie to be a lot better than anything I expected to find. Indeed, I'm rating it higher than I rated T2 (7 stars--after having given T1 a perfect 10).So why did this movie work for me on a second viewing? Perhaps it was because when I saw it the first time my expectations were very high whereas today they were very low. Or perhaps my relative displeasure with how T2 has held up for me made T3 a better movie. What I do know is that this film nailed its action sequences quite well--the long scene with the crane truck is pretty awesome if you ask me. And the female Terminator (whatever model number she is) was neater this time around. Clare Danes does a great job as supporting actress in this movie, and whereas I was expecting the plot and script to be weak overall, I actually felt that it arguably did a better job of advancing the story of the franchise than T2 did.All that said, I'm giving this movie 8/10 stars. It greatly exceeded my expectations for a lazy day Blu Ray movie. Definitely worth giving another shot if you haven't seen it since it came out.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

Taking place in the present day, yet another Terminator, the T-X (Loken) is sent back through time to kill the future leader of the human resistance John Connor (Stahl, filling in for the troubled Edward Furlong), as well as several other future military leaders. The long awaited TERMINATOR sequel lacks director James Cameron and stars Linda Hamilton and Furlongand it shows. Despite some great action sequences by director Mostow (who won me over with 1997's BREAKDOWN) and great special effects, the film fails to capture its audience with awe and wonder like the first two. Several twists about the actual war caused by Skynet (talked about in the first two films but never actually shown) are present here and are a neat touch. However, Loken's T-X isn't nearly as menacing as Robert Patrick's T-1000 in T2. Action to spare, but lacks heart and Cameron's touch. Also, the music score by Marco Baltrami just plain sucks (omitting Brad Fiedel's famous TERMINATOR theme until a lousy orchestrated version at the film's end). RATING: 7 out of 10.

262,robotbling,True Terminator fans will HATE this movie,1,12 December 2011,"(www.plasticpals.com) Terminator 2: Judgment Day is one of the best sci-fi action movies ever made. It was a perfect blend of all the right ingredients: a gripping story; spectacular action scenes; bleeding-edge special effects; and it managed to spin on its head the age-old adage that a sequel cannot, by definition, outdo the original. James Cameron made a masterpiece, and I doubt you would disagree. So when Terminator 3 was announced – and that James Cameron would not be directing – alarm bells started ringing.James Cameron had already proved with Aliens that a sequel to a great film by a different director can actually work. So it's not like Terminator 3 had to be bad – but unfortunately, it is. Sarah Connor, the 2nd most important character in the series next to the Terminator, doesn't appear in the film. T3′s excuse for Linda Hamilton's non-participation is that Sarah died of cancer a few years before the events of T3. If this is true, who is going to train John to become the leader of the resistance? The John we see in T3 isn't Edward Furlong (who wisely passed on the role), it's Nick Stahl, and he doesn't seem prepared to lead a revolution against Skynet at all. He's a total loser who basically ""lives off grid"" to protect his anonymity in the event another terminator comes back to kill him. And it's made clear from his complete lack of reflexes, let alone military skills, that he hasn't spent his time on the edge of society wisely if there's an apocalypse coming.Schwarzenegger reprises his role of the T-800, and who can blame him? Well, I do. I blame him because if he hadn't signed on to this trainwreck it probably wouldn't have gotten financed to begin with. Arnie's return for one more milking at the cash cow was a disgrace. His adversary is a female dominatrix terminator called the T-X, played by Kristanna Loken.Kristanna LokenShe's sexy, but her athleticism is a bit too obvious for the part – ironically, Claire Danes would have made a more interesting casting choice. Besides the fact that the T-1000 was a much better (and seemingly more advanced) villain, the idea of a female terminator is wasted on this film. She isn't even liquid metal, which would lend itself nicely to the sanguine female form (as evidenced by Dural from SEGA's Virtua Fighter), and would lend weight to the idea that a smaller, more agile model could tango with the lumbering lugnuts T-800 model.Instead, Claire Danes gets caught in T3′s web of fail as John's would-be girlfriend, Kate Brewster. In an unbelievable coincidence, Kate happens to be the daughter of the military commander of Skynet. And the guy who penned that has the audacity to call himself a writer! Terminator 3 also delights in taking a giant dump all over the hopeful optimism of the first two films. A recurring idea in the first two stories is that the future is not set. No fate but what we make. This concept is destroyed in T3 when we are shown that regardless of the characters' actions Judgment Day is inevitable.If this was just some throw-away action movie I wouldn't care that much, but as a kid who saw T2: Judgment Day at around the same age as John Connor in that film, it left a lasting impression on me. T3 has no excuse to suck. It could have been a bullseye but it completely misses its target, shooting itself in the head.

267,adrongardner,Mixed Bag,7,3 July 2003,"I went into T3 not knowing what to expect.  I came away not knowing what to think.  The movie is entertaining, let that be said.  The action never lets up except maybe at the end, where it could have used more punch.  In contrast to some reviews I actually liked the storyline, it just felt like it could have gone on a little longer.Arnold is as charismatic as ever, even with the low amount of dialogue.  I was a bit disappointed the lengths the filmmakers went to poke fun at T-800. I wished he could have been a bit closer to the meaner Terminator from the first movie in contrast to the ""softer"" one from T2.  There are many laughs in the film and this is welcome.  The first movie was more of a B horror flick and T2 more sci-fi.  T3 falls somewhere in between the previous two in nearly all areas.The special effects were very good.  The final iteration Arnold goes through in the end is magnificent.  I wished it could have lasted longer. 
With the Matrix Reloaded we had a film that was simply too much.  It also had a story that was so convoluted I really gave up on caring what happens to the characters.  T3 is the opposite in nearly all areas.  It needed more of everything except a few less corny lines.In the end I am now wishing for T4 and an all out battle.  I hope it comes because like the previous two movies, T3 leaves the audience hanging wondering what is going to happen.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

I mean, we basically end up at the end of this one no further than we were after the second one. Sure, time wise we were carried further and we learned some things about John Conner. But I think they did the character a disservice basically showing how pathetic he becomes after the second film.Performances are good in this and the effects are top notch, best of the series. I think in the end, had this film actually taken us to the events after the rise of the machine and given us the battle ensuing, it would have made for a better film. As I said, as is, the film just kind of leaves you in the same place the other two left you in and I know for myself, I was really hoping for something more.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
270,cashbacher,The robots should have been a bit more human,8,17 May 2020,"The first time I watched this movie I was unimpressed, considering the action overwhelming to the relationships. There is no question that the first chase scene goes on far too long and seems to have the sole purpose of simply smashing up cars, buildings and other collateral objects. What made the second movie so good was the dialog and the expanding relationship between the Schwarzenegger terminator and the young John Connor. It reached the point where the good terminator begins to take on some human characteristics and is considered a father figure.
The evil terminator in this movie is powerful, far more than even the one in the second movie. The Schwarzenegger terminator is obsolete and in this movie is also almost exclusively robotic, showing no human-like intonation or facial expression. The evil terminator is also female, yet it also never expresses anything resembling emotions of any kind. The evil male terminator in the second movie occasionally had human-like facial expressions and did not always speak in monotone.
There are some amusing sight gags, specifically regarding the vehicles and when Schwarzenegger rescues John Connor by carrying him in a coffin. Yet, it ends with the very depressing idea that the thermonuclear war known as judgement day was inevitable, something that contradicts the ending of the second movie. It is natural to want the human race to win, not face extinction at the hands of its own electronic creations.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

(I wasn't sure how this would happen without being a repeat of T2, but it works.) I actually like the TX character better than the evil robot in T2, and Claire Danes is always good.

Arnold Swartzenegger is popular at Movie Theaters because he is usually in big budget films. I have a lot of friends who are policemen and because of this I refuse to watch the movie Terminator 1 because of its excessive portrayal of violence in a pretend police station. American Shadow President Jack Kennedys Artificial Intelligence computer just joked ""An emergency command center has been activated, its bad its just a computer."" I as American Shadow Vice President Brad HD Morgan joked back ""Nick stall?"" Nick Stahl is the actor who plays the Future American leader Connor. In a previous bunker joke during the Cuban Missile Crisis President Jack Kennedy said ""I hope you know there's not enough room for everyone in the White House Bunker."" to a response of great laughter to support President Jack Kennedy and his joke.

I guess they cast Nick Stahl because Edward Furlong had become a chubby little couch potato by the time this was made. That means that there were only three characters of any substance, since the female terminator wasn't even a presence onscreen.This film misses by only about a half a mile, since it at least adds a little to the storyline, though many watchers just skip this one and it isn't missed in the overall scheme.

276,clydestuff,Third movie does it's best to make two previous films pointless,4,3 July 2003,"****Plot Points In This Review****I went into Terminator 3 with high hopes and high expectations.  What I left with, was the same feeling I had after viewing Alien 3 for the first time. It had somehow accomplished nothing more than tarnishing the two films that had come before it. Through two Terminator films, we were led to believe that things that happen in the future could be changed, that certain things didn't have to be inevitable.  With Terminator 3, we find out that was all nonsense, that there was no reason for the existence of the first two movies at all, because what's going to happen is going to happen and you can't do a darn thing about it. (just delay it for a while till we can get the next movie made).  So what we end up with is three movies from the George Lucas School of prequels, though we didn't know it till now.  Thanks, but no thanks for cluing us in.There are plenty of exciting action and chase sequences in the film, and they do grab your attention while they are on the screen.  Still, they are nothing more or less than we've seen in any other Summer Blockbuster, so I can't recommend seeing this movie on that alone.  Schwarzenegger does his usual fine one note job as The Terminator, but Nick Stahl's John Connor is so wimpy, we long for Edward Furlong to pop up and give him a swift kick in the pants.  Clare Danes as Kate Brewster, Connor's future wife, is by far more interesting, and you begin to wonder how John Connor and not her ever became the one to lead the rise against the machines.  It almost makes you glad that in the future a Terminator does take out John Connor.  I for one would feel a lot better about it if Kate were leading my revolution. Kristana Lokken, despite not having much to do except morph, is menacing enough, but no more or no less than Robert Patrick was in the previous film. She just has the advantage of having a few more tricks up her sleeve.Will there ever be a Terminator 4?  Could happen I suppose, if this one makes the major dollars as the previous films did.  Trouble is, we now know the ending, and as in the Star Wars prequels, when you know what is going to happen, getting there just isn't that much fun anymore.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

Terminator 3 continues 10 years from where Terminator 2 left off.The acting in Terminator 3 isn't as enthusiastic as in its predecessors. Even though Kristanna Loken is beautiful, she isn't the best actress, but she does add a very robotic attitude to her character. Arnold does a pretty good job, this is one of his last movies from before he went into office. The problem is, his character is more humorous in this movie, and terminators are supposed to be machines with no emotion at all, so that is very out of line for him.There is a killer car chase scene, and an exciting scene towards the end, but when the ending does happen, it is very disappointing as it ruins the entire series.This movie is never boring, and Kristanna Loken is a treat to look at, but the bad script and disappointing ending will make you wish you hadn't wasted your time, so don't bother with this one, see the originals instead.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
278,medrjel,HUGE LETDOWN,6,3 July 2003,"I need to be very careful not to give away anything, but I will state what I feel the major failings are:1) From Edge of Realism to Comic Book. The thing I loved about the first 2 movies was even though much of it was unbelievable, there was quite a bit of tension and realism to the characters and chases. The problem was that T2 pushed the limits. They decided to go farther, and it just became rediculous. Most of the chases I found myself laughable they were so silly.2) Too Many rules changed. If you watch T1 and T2 before T3, you will see exactly what I mean by the way the T-101 acted, especially, since it's not supposed to be the same as from the prior movie(s).3) The theme changed. I feel like the story was going one way in the first 2 movies, and they completely changed their minds as to what to do.Now, I don't want to say the story was without merit and the ending wasn't good, but it was executed and designed POORLY. It feels more like ""let's revive the Terminator movie just to make it"" rather than ""now, how do we pull it all together?"".I think perhaps another 6 months to 1 year to work on the storyboarding and scripting was needed to make this a really good movie, because if this was the first movie, there would NEVER EVER EVER been even a snowflake's chance in hell on the hottest day of the year while sitting in an over set to 5,000,000 F all day for a sequel, let alone anyone caring about it.James Cameron, WHY DID YOU LET THEM DO THIS TO YOUR MOVIE???!!!!!

Now, a newer model of the terminators called a Terminatrix is after John Connor, an childhood friend of John named Kate Brewster, and others before the beginning of Judgement Day. And once again, the terminator(Arnold Schwarzenegger)is back to protect.The movie is the third part of the story making it a trilogy finally and it, like most trilogies, isn't as good as the originals. Although it's not as good, the movie is still quite entertaining. The effects are just as good as Terminator 2: Judgement Day and the movie holds twists that make the movie quite sensational. The movie was just all around good although it had multiple cheesy parts in it. But its a Sci-Fi movie, so just look past that. Overall, the movie was well done and you will enjoy if you look past the flaws and let yourself be entertained.I recommend this movie.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
280,Filmdokter,An unnecessary and uninspired film,4,9 April 2021,"Oh boy...this is a pretty messy film. I understand the near impossible task of being a follow up to T1 & T2. So kudos for trying. But the main problem here lies in it's story, which is pretty much an (unnecessary) rerun of T2. But this time with boring human characters (John Conner, Kathryn Brewster and her daddy are 2 dimensional characters), a bad Terminator that is cheap ripoff from the T1000, a mediocre score (with only the Terminator theme at the end credits) and Schwarzenegger who is mainly played for laughs. The action is often quite messy and repetitive as well. The only bright star here is the downbeat ending.

While the action and chase scenes are certainly gripping – with a chase through downtown L.A. being one of the highlights – the film is initially deterred by a few questionable special effects, and its lack of what made the first two installments so memorable: the diverse plot that touched on the emotions of the characters and audience alike. In addition, the film scarcely takes itself seriously, with a collection of gags and puns that sometimes diffuse the sense of pace.Nonetheless, the tragic final act of the film is bound to pull the heartstrings of even the most die-hard action fan, and gives a satisfying conclusion to the trilogy.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
282,Asteri-Atypical,Decent action but doesn't live up to the Terminator legend,3,6 July 2003,"All the action but almost none of the story...The Hollywood pattern is alive and well in T3.What pattern?  That Hollywood cannot follow up classics with similar quality.  That Hollywood cannot remake a movie or a legend and preserve the power or depth of the original storyline.  That Hollywood will almost always place effects and action above good storytelling.T3 had good ""Terminator action"".  As we would expect with T3's budget and current FX technology, the fight and sequences were great eye candy. Certainly, that's one ingredient of the Terminator movies.  However, unlike T2, there was nothing groundbreaking or cutting edge here.As for the story; well... let me not belabor the details.  That would not be fair, as T3 made itself such an easy target.  Suffice it to say the story doesn't live up to the two Terminator predecessors.  The overall story was pale, indeed, compared with T1 and T2.  Add to that more plot holes that a T-800's flesh covering has at the end of each movie.  Even the dates don't add up when John talks about his age as various events occur.  It was a barely above average plot with very little care given to the details. Barely above average for movies in general; but T1 and T2 were well above average.The directing struck me as average.  Sure, there were some great action sequences, especially in the chase scenes.  Nonetheless, the camera angles, the lighting, the gripping photgraphy; all those elements which Cameron added in T1 and T2 just were not present in T3.  The overall ""artistry"" was competent but inferior to T1 & T2.Acting was decent, with the exception of the T-X.  Loken had the look and knows how to strike a pose but when she spoke, she just didn't grip me. Neither her voice nor articulation added to the mystery or the menace which should be the T-X.All in all, this is a movie worth watching.  As I mentioned, the action and FX are good.  There are some great lines and a couple moments of visual humour.  Where this movie fails is that it does not live up to its legend, especially after a haitus of many years.  Indeed, it was reminicient of Star Wars Episode I in that respect.Utlimately it's worth watching but I would consider this installment to be a major letdown considering that we waited 12 years hoping for a movie of at least similar quality to T2.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

I have never been a huge fan of the Terminator movies (though I can appreciate the story and the FX) and so I wasn't thrilled about this rental, but....I just HAD to see it for myself. The story is a logical continuation of where T2 left off. Following suit, T3 tops the FX in T2 (the new bad guy is COOL)PLUS it's darn funny!!! I laughed through the whole thing!

Like or loathe this movie it will make you sit back and go wow!! every once in a while.  Also despite some of the negative comments i've seen Arnie doesn't do a bad job of reprising his role as the Terminator.The main problems I found with this film is that you never really care weather the main protagonists get killed or not.  The whole movie feels like a re-hash of Terminator 2, the movie never stops moving and what interaction there is between the characters is normally conducted during a car chase.
If they had added maybe 10mins to the runtime and introduced a couple of slower scenes I feel it would have helped the movie and made the wow! moments more effective.  There are some glaring plot inconsistancies between this Terminator 1 and T2 which have been discussed in detail elsewhere. But to be honest this film is not trying to be Citizen Caine, it's trying to be a big dumb action movie and in that respect it succeeds.
Overall it's not a bad movie, but it's not great either.  It's perfect cinema or DVD rental popcorn fodder.  Sit back enjoy the action and don't think too hard and you'll get an enjoyable evenings entertainment, does what it set out to do and no more 6/10.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

286,Mulliga,"An incredibly disappointing and disgustingly commercial 3rd film - shame on everyone involved (SPOILERS, but a true T2 fan should never see this one)",7,12 July 2003,"I was in the U.S. Virgin Islands (which have no movie theatres) during the opening weekend of July 4th. Like many fans, the trailers left me afraid that the franchise's third installment would turn into another Alien 3. I heard reviews saying the film wasn't bad, and even actually good. I went into the theatre expecting an above-average summer action flick and a decent continuation of the Terminator saga. What I got was a big, fat stinker of a movie.There is a scene VERY early on in T3 that signals the start of the end.Like most people, I watched T2 on DVD before seeing T3 to ""get in the mood."" It held up very well, of course, and I even felt compelled to watch the documentaries on the making of the movie. Cameron said, ""It's important not to go too far and make the Terminator a clown figure."" Cameron gave Arnold plenty of sombre, stoic scenes to emphasize the serious nature of this killing machine.In T3, Arnie gets a set of clothes from someone else like in the first two movies. Except, this time, the victim isn't a street tough or a biker: it's a gay stripper at a ladies' bar. When Arnold reaches into the coat for a pair of sunglasses, he pulls out ridiculous Elton John-esque shades. People in the audience chuckled, but I knew in my heart that they were making fun of one of the most memorable villains/heroes ever at the movie's expense.T3 plays like one of those movies shown on the brilliant cartoon ""The Critic"" - cornball humor, overdone action, and little underlying meaning. Mostow, while obviously a fan of the material, doesn't have much in the way of execution. The trademark Terminator feel is gone; no more cold blues, gritty blacks, and warm colors. The pacing of the movie is okay, but the ""look"" of the movie is all wrong and feels artificial.That brings me to the sad part of the review. CGI SHOULD BE BANNED FROM MOVIES FOR THE NEXT TEN YEARS. Why do the special effects of T2, a movie made more than a decade ago, look more realistic than T3? In a move that will inevitably be likened to ""The Phantom Menace,"" Mostow overuses CGI almost from the very start. The TX is completely unbelievable as a deadly weapon - she looks more like a video game character. The nuclear holocaust of T2, one of the finest depictions of a nuclear blast ever put to film, is a computer-generated mess that looks really, really bad in T3. The future war scenes, once gritty and intense, are actually kind of boring. The stunts and fighting, once rooted in some of the best practical effects work in the business, are almost all obviously done on a blue screen or in a computer. I mean, THE ""BATTLE ACROSS TIME"" SHOW AT UNIVERSAL STUDIOS (also directed by Cameron) looks better than this movie! (and it was more satisfying...)Arnold and the cast do an okay job with the stuff written for them. Claire Danes and Nick Stahl worked well, but why couldn't they hire somebody that looked like Eddie Furlong? Leonardo DiCaprio (of all people) would've been a better choice, since he's a dead ringer for Edward and even worked with Claire Danes in ""Romeo + Juliet"". Kristanna Loken lacks the menace and presence of Robert Patrick, even though she says even fewer lines (she doesn't even talk for the last half of the movie!). Arnold still looks good, but (and this is partially the script's fault) you never feel like he's Terminator - he feels like Arnold. The bit players feel okay but slightly hackneyed. There's a cameo by Dr. Silberman for the fans, but Silberman doesn't feel like the Silberman in the past two movies.That brings the problem of continuity. The Terminator POV screens in this one look nothing like the first two. The music is all different - I long for Brad Fiedel's driving techno-industrial score, not Marco Beltrami's forgettable drivel. I am definitely not happy with the whole idea of Connor's ""lieutenants"" - why the hell does Connor have to save the world, anyway? If he has more than half a dozen lieutenants, couldn't someone else take his place?Surprisingly, the story as a whole isn't bad. I'm kind of miffed that they threw out the whole ""the future's not set"" angle, but the ending was decent. It's just that the silly, botched execution of an inexperienced, b-grade director brings down the film.2 out of four stars",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

Filmmakers are always waiting to cash on by making unoriginal sequels just to cash on the fame of the original classics. So sick, sequels nowadays are nothing but money grabbing business. I felt relieved when I saw that T2 still grossed more than this unnecessary sequel despite being released way back in 1991.Plot is again a rehash of T2 which was also a rehash of T1 but with a twist. Still what T2 has and T3 misses is a good story. I liked the concept of the Inevitable Judgement Day in T3 even though it violates the Cameron's closure in T2. Still, the film misses many things that would have made it a likable sequel like T2. One of the strongest character of the franchise Sarah Connor is sidelined from the story which ruined the experience, something like the way 'Alien 3' destroyed the positives of 'Aliens'. Arnold's Terminator character kind of feels more like human than machine. The iconic theme of Brad Fiedel is totally missing till the credits roll, even then again it is not entirely used. The terminator T-X is surprisingly pales in comparison to T-1000 of Terminator 2. The dread and ruthlessness of The Terminator was entirely missing, making the chase sequence more cartoonish than horrific. Well yes that's one thing which became enjoyable in this ride of discontent, some clichéd moments like the truck chase similar to T2 yet less appealing, Arnold putting on pink-star glasses only to find it resenting, etc. Parody and comedy felt like nice breaks in mundane action. The characters of John Connor and Katherine Brewster had some nice potential to built up in the story but no the script focuses more on not the so great T-X. Skynet's rise to become self- aware wasn't explained properly. Also they failed to portray John Connor as an effective leader and Nick Stahl felt completely lost. Even Edward Furlong was able to highlight a better and useful 10- year old John Connor in T2. The CGI isn't much special, almost similar to T2 even though T3 was done in a time of more advanced tech. The concept of time-travel can be extensively used to churn out repetitive sequels even though the whole thing is riddled with paradoxes. And that's what T3 does. Rise of the Machines feels pathetic in comparison to its predecessors. Still it has some good action sequences. Also I felt the ending was justifiable even though the path taken was disappointing. T3 is never very boring as such, you just have this feeling of pale discontent.RATING: [2/5]",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
289,pri_e,Disappointing!,6,20 July 2003,"I had heard great reviews about this movie, I wasn't terribly sure whether they should have made a 3rd installment to the already successful ""Terminator"" movies. After watching this film, this is the opinion that I have: this movie doesn't even compare to the brilliance that was the first two movies. Despite Nick Stahl and Claire Danes doing a great job as John Connor and Kate Brewster, I thought their storyline way way too soft. Arnold Schwarzenegger was good in his role as the T-800, however he looked as if he didn't have the same interest in playing the role. This T-800 lacked the character that he had in the previous movies despite the notion that he's coming back as different models. I thought that Kristanna Loken was weak as the TX-Terminatrix, not even close to being as sinister as Arnie was in the first movie and Robert Patrick as the T-1000 in the second movie. It's plainly obvious that she was chosen for the role to entice males into watching this movie and also maybe to show that women are strong etc. I'm a woman and I wasn't impressed by her at all, a man should have played the villain or better yet Robert Patrick as a stronger terminator model.Don't expect anything like the first two installments, the only thing that stuck to true terminator style was the truck scene.

292,Lando_Hass,The absence of James Cameron is very noticeable (spoilers),1,3 July 2004,"Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines follows the 1984 hit Terminator, and the 1991 hit Terminator 2: Judgment Day, two intelligent, well made films. T3 is the complete opposite of Terminator 1 and 2. Terminator 1 and 2 were both intelligent films, with a style and wit that to this day is unmatched. T3 was directed by Jonathon Mostow, a guy who knows how to handle his actions scenes, but a guy who also has no respect for T3's predecessors. Mostow has made some movies in the past, but I've only seen one: Breakdown. Breakdown was a very good movie that fleshed out it's characters and had a distinct feeling to it. Breakdown was a good movie. I liked it a lot. But, back to T3. T3 has some VERY entertaining and very well directed action scenes. But that's the problem. The movie is all action scenes, with no complex merit whatsoever. Though I like the action scenes, I have a strong problem with the way the movie was handled story wise. Jonathon Mostow, like I said, knows how to handle his actions scenes, and I'm sure he likes the previous Terminator movies. The problem is that he has no respect for the complex plot that comes with the first two movies. The first movies had a few holes, but they still managed to explain everything coherently. Terminator 3 does not do that. Jonathon Mostow completely ignores everything from the first movies, there are so many plot holes and questions that are unanswered, like how did Skynet suddenly continue development even though everything was destroyed in T2, and how does (SPOILER) Judgment Day suddenly become inevitable even though in the first films they make it clear that it can be stopped. All of these questions are unanswered, and as I sat in the theater almost exactly a year ago, I noticed all of these problems. When I walked out of the theater, I absolutely despised this movie because it betrayed the first films. I bought the DVD, and I didn't hate it as much. My feelings towards it now are mixed. This time around, a female Terminator, the T-X, is sent back through time to kill John Conner (and someone else, who I wont mention). Again, the T-800 (I call it the T-800 because T-101 is a load of bulls***) is sent back to protect John. Here's another plot hole though: In the ending, they say Judgment Day is inevitable, so why would they bother to send a Terminator back to kill John? John was the one to prevent the war, but according to this movie, the war was going to happen no matter what, so why bother sending them back to kill John? The T-X objective is to 'Ensure the rise of the machines.' If the rising of the machines is inevitable, why would they send her back to ensure it? John couldn't have stopped the rise of the machines because it was inevitable, so why send them back? It just doesn't make a bit of sense. Jonathon Mostow could have also acknowledged a reason just to clear the air, like he could of said the arm that cut off from the T-800 in the first film was found by some people and used that to create the Terminators, and even though finding an arm and making an army of machines from it would be implausible it would still fill some plot holes and answer some questions. Instead, Jonathon Mostow goes down the path of the summer action movie, he loads his movie with nonstop shooting, nonstop explosions, and nonstop special effects, and as much as I enjoyed these fights, explosions, and bullets it still doesn't change the fact that the movie betrayed it's predecessors. The T-X is played by Kristanna Loken, this is probably her first major role in a film. Loken is a hot blonde who had the potential to be a good Terminator but again, because of Jonathon Mostow, she failed. The greatest thing about Robert Patrick's performance in the first film was the fact that he was grim, he had absolutely no emotion in his face AT ALL, he truly embodied the characteristics of a cyborg, and he did one of the most grim performances in film history (in my opinion). Kristanna Loken doesn't do that. In most scenes, when Loken is supposed to show no emotion and not show any pleasure in killing, she does the opposite, and this is because Jonathon Mostow's crappy directing. More than half the time, Loken has a smirk on her face, and when she talks, she has WAY too much movement in her face. Supposedly, Jonathon Mostow liked the idea of having the T-X smirk, so he told Kristana to keep doing it, but Mostow forgets one thing: Loken is supposed to be a machine, one that isn't supposed to smile or anything like that, and sometimes, it looks like the T-X is taking pleasure in killing just by the look on her face, but people know pleasure is a human feeling, and people know machines cant have an human feelings. Robert Patrick made the T-1000 one of the best villains in film history, sadly, Kristana Loken didn't do anything she could with the T-X character, and it's mostly Jonathon Mostow's fault, the guy only knows how to direct explosions and car chases, but when it comes to directing complex characters like machines he fails. Arnold Schwarzenegger returns as the T-800 (again, I'm not calling it the T-101), and like his performances in the first films, it is top notch. Arnold is able to maintain the same feeling he pulled off in T1 and T2, without really changing the character. Arnold doesn't show emotions, but in T2, he does have emotions, and that's the point of his character in the end, but I guess in this he didn't really need to show the traits he had in the first movie. Arnold has aged over the years, but still proves that regardless of age, he can still be an action star, his performance is good, but in T2 he did a better job, probably because in that movie his character had more depth, more areas to explore like emotions, but in this one, all he has to do is be there and be a machine. In T2, Edward Furlong played John Conner. Furlong was signed on to this when it was announced, but due to drug and drinking problems, he was fired from the project, and Nick Stahl was hired the be John Conner. At first, I thought Stahl was a terrible choice to be John Conner, but it turns out that he actually did a good job at being the character. His acting job wasn't as good as Furlong's, but it was still pretty good. I cant say that replacing Furlong with Nick Stahl was a better idea because Furlong is the one who gave life to the character, but Nick Stahl does give a good performance.When it comes to story, Terminator 3 falls flat on it's ass. Jonathon Mostow knows how to handle his actions scenes and his explosions and all that s***, but he doesn't know how to handle the storyline. When the predecessors to the movie you're doing are Terminator 1 and 2, you need to make sure that the story is preserved, you need to make sure that you fill each plot hole and explain everything, but the Terminator storyline is a storyline that can only be handled by one person: James Cameron. Jonathon Mostow chooses to ignore virtually everything. What he does to make sure audiences don't see these holes is he piles on an avalanche of action scenes, explosions, and guns, and even though I love all these things in movies, Terminator movies are more than just explosions and action. Jonathon Mostow seemed to want to just make his own movie, and just call it Terminator, because this movie has no relation to the first, it simply ignores every plot point and just tries to cloak all the holes with action, action, and more action. There is almost no character development, the pacing is completely off target, the movie is nothing but action.The T-X was once intended to be a male Terminator, and to tell you the truth, it would have worked better that way. Kirstana Loken is extremely hot, but I don't think she fits in the role. It was said that Vin Diesel was considered for the role of the T-X, and to tell you the truth, Diesel would have been an excellent choice, because I think Diesel would have been able to not show any emotion, he would have been able to convey a dark, ruthless nature with the character, and he simply would have fit the role perfectly. Most people say no, they say Vin Diesel sucks, but these people let the popcorn movies he's done overshadow his good performances. In A Man Apart, Diesel did an excellent job at conveying the bitterness and darkness of the character, in Boiler Room his performance was good, and in Knockaround Guys his performance was also very good. Diesel would have fit perfectly as a Terminator, just as long as Jonathon Mostow didn't have anything to do with the movie. Diesel would have made the role work, he would have made the character emotionless and ruthless. He would have fit better than anyone else.Terminator 3 was one of those sequels that nobody really asked for. Terminator 1 and 2 were two of the best films I've ever seen, and Terminator 2 finished off everything leaving no questions. Terminator 3 was not asked for, it should have never been made. The only reason why it was made was for one reason: Money. It's production budget was 175 million I believe, but it only made 150 million, which means it tanked, but a T4 is going to be made, without Arnold most likely, and Jonathon Mostow is supposedly going to direct. It's going to be a disaster, it's going to be a repeat of this. Mostow should be banned from making anything involving Terminator, he has no respect for the Terminator movies, he betrayed them, and he simply didn't care. Most people will say 'Terminator 3 was just supposed to be a summer action movie, it wasn't supposed to be complex, it was just supposed to be fun.' Statements like these are irrelevant, because the Terminator movies weren't ever supposed to be summer action films, they were supposed to be smart action movies with depth, they weren't supposed to be mindless like this. If Terminator 4 is made by Jonathon Mostow, it'll suck ass. If it's made by Cameron, it'll be great. T3 had so many unanswered questions like how did Skynet continue production, how could Judgment Day be inevitable, and how could anyone actually approve this movie without thinking about the complexity and wit of the first two films?Score: 3 out of 10.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
293,thewillt08,Hasta La Vista to this Franchise,2,13 July 2013,"With the brilliance in Terminator one and two there is no way Terminator three can be a disaster, right? It has such a strong foundation it is literally impossible to screw up. Or so I thought, then Terminator Rise of the Machines was made and oh how I wish it never was shown to the public or even to deaf and/or blind children.There are probably 10-15,000 problems with this movie. I heard it was bad but I went in with low expectations and the first thing I see is the producer and director's names. I couldn't believe it wasn't James Cameron. I thought if James Cameron was involved then it couldn't possibly be that bad but from the title screen I lost a lot of hope. James Cameron is the main reason these movies were a success. He created this story, the characters, and through his vision these movies came to life. Now somebody else is ripping off his work to make a buck and he destroyed this franchise.Problem number two, the beginning. It is cookie cutter by now to have Arnold appear, naked, and look for clothes and throw some bodies, but now the evil Terminator is a woman. I saw her and I was devastated. I'm not being sexist and saying a female can't be in this role but this a man's movie. An action packed man experience and seeing a girl follow up to the T-1000 was impossible for anybody. She does the exact same thing as the first two with the emotionless stares and few lines. The intimidation factor was down and she wasn't too special or more advanced from the previous model. In the third installment we revisit the character of John Connor and the way this man turned out was so disappointing. The kid in the second movie was ten times better than this clown. This guy stopped Judgment Day, or so he thought, and he is a coward. He runs and runs in fear. I hated his character and the way he was written. His lines were weak, his acting was weak, and everything about his character was stupid. I thought Sarah Connor would have still taught him to be an intimidating beast, or at least a man. This guy is embarrassing to the supposed to be hero of humanity. On a side note I hate what happens to Sarah. I won't say what happens because I think it is supposed to be a surprise but I was so angry. A character as awesome and dedicated to the story as her deserved better for this film. The main problem with this story is that it probably should never have been made. I was perfectly happy with the ending if Terminator two. If anything this movie takes away the impact of the previous movie. ""You didn't stop Judgment Day, you delayed it."" That one line ruined everything. Everything done in the second movie was basically for nothing. I would have probably been happier if Arnold was not in this movie. He and John had a strong bond as a kid and when John sees the new Terminator he acts really odd. The chemistry they built up in the previous movie was also for nothing. ""I guess I have to re-teach you everything."" So many things disappointed me in this movie it was hard for me to find any positives. If I had to say at least one good thing I guess t could be the climax leading to the ending. Skynet is back and we learn a lot more about the beginning of the end. We see the end begin with the fatal mistake and the idea of the impossibility to change the future is still interesting. The last ten minutes or so I had mixed feelings about. They build it up to be something epic and it turns out to be something unexpected. At that point I didn't really care about the ending and I accepted it for what it was. It left off with the strong possibility of another movie, and there is a review will be here soon. Finally I will touch upon the special effects. Well, they weren't that good. In the beginning there is another crazy car chase with cars flying everywhere and way too much destruction. A car crashes into a wall at high speeds and it somehow explodes. Just because a car crashes into something doesn't mean it has explode. The shots with a Terminator being lit up by round after round of ammunition by cops get old. Every action scene in this movie has been used in a similar or exact same way in one of the previous two films. If I have to play devil's advocate I will say I did love the giant robot inside Skynet tearing apart person after person and everything in its path that was awesome. Overall, Terminator Rise of the Machines did the impossible. It was almost impossible for this movie to fail and it did on almost every single aspect of a film to fail. There was poor writing, awful characters, and ridiculous action. If the story had to continue anything else would have been better. I am glad I saw this movie at least once just to say I saw the entire franchise to date, I obviously had to watch this before Salvation and Salvation has also been seen, but I will probably never watch it ever again. Before I give it the WillyT rating I hope you noticed I didn't mention the girl in the story. That is probably because I just remembered her. She is awful, adds nothing to the story, also poorly written, and I hated almost everything about her. There that should be enough ranting for one day. This disgrace of a Terminator movie gets the WillyT Seal of DISapproval.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
294,Sfpsycho415,Excellent---8/10,8,8 July 2003,"I was going in with low expectations like everyone else. I knew i would be entertained but i didn't think it would be a good entry into the Terminator series. Oh was i ever wrong. This movie was fantastic. In it, Arnold is back again as the futuristic cyborg who must protect John Conner (Nick Stahl) from a robot assassin, this time played by Kristanna Loken. Arnold is back in the role that made him Ahnold. Kristanna Loken is a great villain (Not to mention super hot). She is no T-1000, though the action sequences were incredible and their were some unexpected twists that caught everyone in the theater off-guard. Everyone is crying about how James Cameron isn't involved, but i think Jonathon Mostow did a superb job. If there is a Terminator 4, i won't complain, even though it is not necessary. 8/10",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
295,squir1y,"Oh boy, another Terminator!",10,13 July 2003,"Just like everyone else, I had my doubts about this movie. Basically, for the same reasons as everyone else. But damn, this was good.I love the Terminator flicks. I've been a big fan since I was ten. Yeah, my parents weren't too restrictive when it came to the movies I watch. I love action films and I love Arnold. This guy will always be cool to me. I even forgave him for Batman and Robin.This movie was really great. It has a great story, outstanding action and good performances. Hence, it's a Terminator movie. In fact, I don't think I've ever been so impressed by action scenes in some of the more recent movies. Watching that bathroom fight, I started thinking to myself,""You know, I don't care if you are a machine. That had to hurt!"" As for the performances, I can't say enough about Arnold. The new character I liked the most was Claire Danes' Kate Brewster. I really felt for her character. Her fear, her grief and her confusion. She really gave a great performance. Nick Stahl was good, even though he looked nothing like the John Connor in the previous film. Kristanna Loken is awesome as the T-X. I didn't think her character would be as ominous as the previous Terminators. I was wrong.If I have any gripes, it's the pacing. This movie just jumped too quickly into the plot and it leaves some questions unanswered. I want to know how Arnold got his shotgun and how he found John and Kate at the beginning. But the ending more than made up for it. It really made me think. In fact, I better turn off my computer now before it's too late! I'll just leave by saying this: They can make as many action movies as they want, but none will ever top the excitement and entertainment of the Terminator series. Bring on T4! 10/10",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
296,Marx_Bros_Fan86,"Decent, but it feels recycled",6,28 January 2006,"When I first heard they were making a third Terminator movie, I was expecting it to be absolutely horrible. Fortunately I was wrong, but T3 still isn't great. T1 impressed audiences with its dark and gritty style, and T2 awed people with its spectacular action scenes and special effects. T3 is merely a passable summer action flick with a recycled story. Sarah Connor is dead and John Connor (Nick Stahl) is in his twenties. Judgment Day never happened, but John is paranoid, and is constantly looking over his shoulder. The film gets going when a new female Terminator called the T-X (Kristaana Loken) is sent back in time to kill Connor, his future lieutenants and his future wife Katherine Brewster (Claire Danes). Again, Arnold is sent back to protect them. Arnold explains to John that Judgment Day is inevitable, but John and Katherine can't accept that, so they attempt to stop Judgment Day once and for all. Again. And there you have the film's biggest weakness: Deja Vu. T3 brings nothing new to the table, except a daring ending.T3 has the most lighthearted feel of all the Terminator films. The sentimentality from T2 has been replaced with jokes, most of which are misses in my opinion. The performances here are merely adequate. While the T-X is by far the most powerful of all the Terminators, Loken still doesn't exude the predator like quality Arnold and Robert Patrick had. I do like how the T-X beats up The Terminator from the start. The good guys feel outmatched, which Terminator 2 never quite achieved until the end. Nick Stahl and Claire Danes are satisfactory in their roles, but I can't say I miss Edward Furlong. Arnold has more of a drill sergeant attitude here as opposed to the ""friendly"" Terminator in T2. His attitude here is much more believable IMO. He also deserves credit for getting back into perfect physical shape. The action scenes are fun, but some are overblown to the point of absurdity. Stan Winston's makeup and robots are very impressive, and the endo-skeletons are scarier than ever. However, the film's greatest merit is its ending. (SPOILERS) Mostow took a big risk ending the movie with the start of the nuclear attacks. He could have gone the safe route and given the movie a happy ending. Now there is an opportunity to make a fourth Terminator movie that does not follow the same formula as T1; it can just be about the war against the machines. I just hope a studio will have the guts to make it without Arnold.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
297,Eraser81,Arnold's Back!!,9,13 July 2003,"There was a 7 year gap between T1 and T2.  And now a 12 year gap between T2 and T3. But is was worth the wait.  The Terminator is sent through time to save mankind and John Conner!  To do so, he has to contend with the TX, a sophisticated evil terminator that will stop at nothing to do what is programmed to do.Kristanna Loken is the TX, a beautiful but deadly cyborg and only Arnold Schwarzenegger can stop her!The film greatly combines action, drama, and even humor.  The humor doesn't fall flat either.

298,gothicgoblin1334,"It stinks, and it gives James Cameron a bad name",1,19 June 2006,"Before I forward the review I must tell you that this movie simply gives James Cameron and the terminator series a bad name. I find that all the loud action scenes and partial nudity a bore to me for it does not make the writing material or acting or quality any better. OK, on with the review...Hollywood made an attempt to make another chapter in the sci-fi trilogy of The Terminator. A rise of the machines as they planned to do it, yet they failed to do so. There is no James Cameron in this movie; it's almost like he never made the terminator; which is a shame because he is the true creative force behind the machines as well as his friend who helped write this movie. Anyway, the movie starts out with Nick Stahl speaking his story of the terminators and of such material and judgement day. I will give them credit that they followed the concept of the second one even though they should have been more original. However we do not see the notorious and wonderful Linda Hamilton in this film; which pretty much gives the audience a chance to look at it more negatively. True, they follow the elements of Shwartzennagger and judgement day but this was simply a bad Hollywood attempt at resurrecting this movie from the nineties. They put gigantic loud noises (to cover the audience's mouths from saying: ""Hey, WHERE'S THE BEEF) they put big explosions (so the producers could 'eliminate' their problems but failed like they did here) and they put out of place vulgarity huomour (as to change the subject of the critics when they bring up this movie) but if you are to take all that away, and I mean all of it, then you simply get what this movie really is: another failed Hollywood big budget action movie; simplifying nothing.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
299,eamon-hennedy,A Fantastic Film.,10,4 January 2004,"No Cameron, Arnie being a tad older and the fact it was twelve years since T2, while I was looking forward to Terminator 3, I was also a bit of wary, but I shouldn't have been. Terminator 3:Rise of the Machines is fantastic, a spectacularly entertaining blockbuster ride that continues the story with respect, great action, a knowing sense of humor and with a seriousness that doesn't drag the film down. Mostow may have seemed like an unusual choice to direct (someone more along the lines of John McTiernan or Ridley Scott would have more accommodating I would have thought), but he does justice to the first two, continuing the saga of John Connor in a way that more than respects the fineness of the first two films.Essentially the film is a mixture of the first two installments, more so the second one, in the execution of the action sequences (huge chase scene, cyborgs beating each other to a pulp), but like the first one, Mostow favors a more pessimistic tone to the film, giving the film a sense of approaching darkness, especially in the final minutes that is both shocking, touching and moving, in much the same way as Cameron did in the first Terminator film. Mostow does not just put Connor in danger again, have him stop judgment day again and have him live happily ever after again. No, he layers the film with twists and turns such as the fact that the machines' strike on humans was merely delayed and that Connor is now dead in the future, that it his future wife, Katherine (played by Claire Danes) who has sent the T-800 back to save John. Nick Stahl replaces Edward Furlong and he is a good replacement, perfectly playing the part with a brooding intensity. Danes is charming and if there is a fourth film I hope she will be in it. Kristanna Loken is great at the T-X. Playing the part with a cold blooded humor that is fantastic to watch and lastly there's Arnie. Let's just say it's like watching someone ride a bike after having not done so for many years. He clearly hasn't forgotten (talk to the hand is right).All in all Terminator 3 is terrific. A surprising joy from start to finish, one hopes that a forth film will be left alone because as it stands this is a perfect little trilogy.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
300,boondocksaint20,A worthy sequel,9,6 August 2003,"I was very apprehensive about this one for a while...but at the same time, excited.  The first two Terminators are pure works of art, in my opinion, flawless examples of filmmaking on almost every level (except for a couple of plot inconsistencies...like it matters though!).  James Cameron is a master of story telling, pacing, editing, characterization, and of course, special effects.  He is one of the best directors of our time....unfortunately he refused to film the newest installment of the Terminator series, though Jonathon Mostow did do a good job on T3.  At any rate, T1 and T2 were incredibly hard acts to follow, so T3 already had larger than life shoes to fill...and for the most part, it fills them quite nicely.T3 literally dives head first right into the action after a short 3 minute or so prologue.  I will be honest, though the first hour has a lot of great stunts and hard core action, it just didn't do anything for me.  To me, it was all been there, done that from the get go, and felt rushed. Basically, the entire characterization part of the main characters that we loved in T2 was dealt with, in this movie, in about 10 minutes or less, and immediately dives into the same formula...killer robot goes on a rampage killing a ton of people for a reason that is not quite clear at the moment, but will unfold later.  Literally, there was no suspense, or buildup, just mindless explosion after explosion.  Don't get me wrong, I love a good action film, but with T3, one has to expect more...more substance, more story, more grasping the struggle for humanity...Don't worry, I'm about to go on the great aspects of the film, and there are quite a few to mention...All of my negativity ceased immediately when the second act began.  This movie totally blew me away during it's last hour.  The plot is finally explained and the story continues, with the central theme being that the ideals that 'There is no fate but what we make' can now all be thrown out the window.  Judgement day is inevitable, along with the destinies of future resistance leaders John Connor and his bride to be, Claire Danes.  All I will say is that when they take the fight to Skynet is when I was totally hooked until the very end.  As for the ending, I was very impressed.  A truly appropriate ending that will make you think long after you've left the theater.  I thought the ending was exactly what it should have been. Bring on T4!!But, at any rate, T3, though pales in comparison to T2, which was obvious that it would even before it came out, it is a worthy addition to the Terminator saga.  Though, it does fail in several areas...for instance, there is almost no charisma between this new Terminator and John Connor, and very little plot time is given to the developing relationship between Connor and Kate Brewster (Claire Danes).  This aspect alone is my biggest complaint with the movie.  T1 and T2 showed how humanity can survive even in its darkest hour, and in T2, there is an irony that the only fatherly love that John Connor ever felt was from a machine.  Unfortunately, this theme was not carried on into this installment...the three main characters simply fight to survive and that's about it.  Given the circumstances though, it does seem realistic, but that is the fault of the filmmakers because they made the film so short...the true fans didn't want to see a compressed 105 min or so film loaded to the brim with action...we also wanted to see more drama, more character development, more everything that T2 had besides the explosions. Don't get me wrong, the new story is great, the acting is very good, and the action is superb...it's just there was that extra dose of the preservation of humanity that was missing.  Also, my next biggest complaint is the lack of a good, hard core, blood pumping soundtrack.  Where the hell was it?!? What we get is pure crap, or as for the first car chase scene, practically DEAD SILENCE for about 10 minutes.  Remember the cool tracks played when Arnie was on his motor cycle, or when he was fighting the swat team in T2? Man, I was simply aching for a musical score that would somehow TRY to compliment the mood of excitement...instead T3's score manages to surprisingly dull the excitement instead of adding to it.  Thankfully, we do get to hear the famous Terminator theme song in all of it's glory, but unfortunately, it is during the end credits.  Though the movie is still very good, these two things in particular (or lack there of) are what majorly drag it down.  On another note, I thought Kristanna Loken as the TX was pretty good, though not NEARLY as menacing as Robert Patrick's T-1000, she still looked very cool and very sexy in her breakthrough role...it's just too bad the filmmakers didn't allot a larger running time to allow a better buildup that establishes her as someone we love to hate and fear to dread. So in other words, T3's major let downs are not from overdoing anything, but underdoing way too much.Yeah, that sounds like I'm going back on my praise for T3, but I'm really not...I'm only pointing out frustrations from a true fan of the first two Terminators, just like the same thing Matrix fans can say about the Matrix Reloaded (but that is a much different story).  T3 was action packed, had an incredible story that continued the saga nicely, and also added it's own shocking elements, had great acting, good direction, and above all else, Arnie once again in his glorious prime.  Arnie fans will NOT be disapointed with T3...though that depends on how much you compare it to T2, which I myself have found myself doing writing this review.Anyway, the sad thing is that now that Arnie is running for governor, I doubt he will be making an inevitable T4 which will most definitely take place in the future.  But, this is the installment that everyone is waiting for!  At any rate, I loved T3 overall...it was a surprising breath of fresh air during a summer full of high priced stink fests.  This is Arnie at his best, and will hopefully revitalize his career...though it is sad to think that this is probably the last time Arnie will ever be in this top form again.  Since this is the peak of his comeback, I hate to admit that his career is probably all downhill from here.  Then again, who wants to see a Terminator in a wheel chair?I highly recommend T3.  Arnie truly did not disapoint in making a quality film, just try not to compare it too much to the other movies and you will enjoy it all the better.  I give it a strong 8.5/10 stars, and look forward to it coming out on dvd.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

302,quiqueperezsoler,It honestly aged well. A solid third entry (with a good final twist) of a franchise that had an uphill battle to keep up its masterful story.,8,14 October 2020,"Perhaps it's because of the awful future entries the movie franchise received and additionally the fact that this movie could in no way live up to the reputation and innovative cinema the prior ones, especially the second one, had. But this film stands on his own with solid action, a solid story and a final twist that make it all the better.While cheesy and more light-hearted in terms of amusing sequences that rob the movie of the prior serious tone, the movie has an interesting premise and a decent execution of the development of the events. The CGI surprisingly holds up pretty well despite the nearly 20 years of the movie. Thanks, in part, to the additional use of practical effects.I think fans were and perhaps still are disappointed with the casting of particularly the adult John Connor but I personally believe he does a good job of conveying that worn out almost homeless ""kid"" that never really settled down and kept running and living in fear. Sure, he does look a bit innocent and he doesn't really look like the kid actor's interpretation of young John, but after a while you get used to it. But who stills the show is, as always, Arnold and his Terminator. Although, as previously mentioned, the comedic aspects of him are a bit overkill. The director is not able to catch that endearing charisma and comedy that characterises James Cameron's T2.As for the plot, I really believe it is inteligent and logical. After the events of T2, everything that unravels has changed as well as the targets. Many of the plot points and events still make sense in the line of the the prior entries, maintaining a consistency that in nowadays' franchises seem to be very VERY hard to maintain. Franchise creators are no longer worried about the consistency of their franchises and don't look at ""the bigger picture"", taking into account tone, themes and overall aesthetic of the franchise to make a coherent and sequential story.As previously mentioned, the ending plot twist is incredible and daring. A move that perhaps risked the future of the following installments but that overall wraps together what I consider and will always consider the ""Terminator Trilogy"" (not duology).IN CONCLUSION, it's fast-paced, decently coherent, action-packed and worthy sequel of T2, managing to deliver a well-realised story that played with all the characters of the franchise so far (despite that particular one having a less ""relevance"" in the movie giving the main focus to another character) and which had great action moments as well as innovative ideas in terms of design and sequences that makes the crowd go ""oh yeah"" although, of course, not as fulfilling as the T2 or even T1 ""oh yeah"" moments. I don't know why everyone hates or simply ignores this movie, I think it is incredibly well done and sure, it won't win any oscars, but it has amazing entertainment value and I will always watch it after T1 and T2. The rest I won't even bother watching, Terminator saga ended with these 3. There's really a lot of potential in the premise of the franchise but, in my opinion, it isn't in the post-apocalyptic era, it's in the past. If they could manage to get James Cameron on board or simply come up with a different story within this universe, without involving John Connor, there'd be a lot to offer. I mean, one leader for the resistance of mankind? The world is pretty big, guys, really noone else is leading a resisting group of humans some place else? This is a global event, America, play with others too.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
303,Deckard-16,WOW! By far the best sequel to a sequel ever!,9,6 July 2003,"I almost feel guilty for liking this movie so much. Who'd have thought that T3 without James Cameron's involvement could be anything slightly better than average? But T3 is not only a 10 on the ""summer escapist movie"" scale it is also a 9 on any other scale unless your idea of a great movie is Moulin Rouge or The Hours. Johnathan Mostow has taken the reins from Cameron for a Mach2 gallop. This movie is funny, lighter and as muscular as ever despite its much shorter length. An early chase scene is better than anything ever seen on the big screen (sorry French Connection and Reloaded) and although it is the high point of the movie T3 maintains the steam built up by it-- which I found astonishing. Nick Stahl and Claire Danes are very welcome additions to the T-mythos. Linda Hamilton's Sarah Connor is almost not missed here (her fate is nicely handled) and Edward Furlong's John Connor is not missed at all. Arnold is in fine and, sometimes finer, form. Kristanna Loken doesn't have the acting chops of Robert Patrick, but her TX is an advancement over his T1000. Give everybody credit. The tech credits are as good, if not better, than the last 2 Ts. The real surprise is the story and the writing. On close analysis T3 may seem like a rehash or mismash of the T1&2 and it may not make any logical sense. So what? Count the calories in your next pizza and beer combo. Be a buzzkill. All I know is that I cared about the characters and what was happening to them. I was caught up in the story. T3 is as much fun as you'll ever have at movie.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
304,cyclone259,so-so,5,8 April 2009,"I'm a huge Arnold Schwarzenegger fan, or at least I was. Politics aside, I've enjoyed most of his films, even if many of them were basically no-brainer, popcorn action flicks.By all accounts he WAS a huge action star back in the day, but even with all the bodybuilding he did to get ready for T3, I still wasn't buying him as The Terminator I enjoyed from the first installments anymore. Everybody ages and even after most of the budget seems to have gone to pancake make-up and Oil of Olay to cover his wrinkles, I'm still unconvinced. I really, really wanted to give him a chance to reprise the role he so superbly fit back in 1984 and again in T2, but it's 19 years later. In the end, he's a 60+ year-old guy with a great build for his age.As for the story; it was OK. I've certainly seen better sci-fi and action films. Did it add much to The Terminator universe? Not really. It did accomplish the feat of tying up some lose ends as to how John Connor survived the nuclear attack that is necessary for there to even be a Terminator plot line. I'm not sure that the movie could have been made without Schwarzenegger somewhere in the mix, but I guess we'll all find out when T4 opens.The characters themselves were fairly cardboard and underdeveloped. Thankfully the first two movies gave some background because this one really did not help it along. I can say the the addition of a female Terminator was an interesting twist and broadened the scope of the Terminator world.If you loved the first two as I did (I've seen The Terminator at least 100 times), you'll need to see T3, just don't get your hopes too high.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
305,Streetwolf,Wait for it to come out on vhs/dvd.,1,5 July 2003,"This movie was so not worth a watch.Summary: We speed up in time and join the loner John Connor, now an adult unaware that his time is approaching to take control of his life and the lives of others to survive judgement day. A new terminator, the TX has been sent back to destroy all those who were commanding officers under John Connor, but John, along with the help of an allied terminator go on a rescue to save his future wife from being killed by the new improved terminator TX and to stopping judgement day.The ending is not what you would expect, the new TX was very cool although she had 2 lines in the whole movie and as for the rest of the cast, Arnie is back butt naked again as the allied terminator, but apparently isn't the same one that died before... he's a new one and he only takes commands from Kate Brewster... John Connor's future bride, but the kids here have some history, which Kate keeps bringing up at odd times. The first Terminator movie rocked, the 2nd one rocked more but the 3rd one rolled over and died. The only highlight is the new TX, who is described by a close friend of mine as being ""hot"". I've rated this a 4 out of 10, but just barely.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
306,WilsonLau,Rise of Arnold...From the ashes of Collateral Damage...etc,9,8 July 2003,"The Terminator movie machine has risen and it has taken the lives of inferior sequels everywhere! As we celebrate the return of Arnold to a role that defined action roles in the last 3 decades(80's 90's 2k)we also celebrate the successful return of the Terminator franchise as it come bursting out into the limelight once again. I believe the success of this movie not only rests on the $170 m. budget, the solid acting, well choreographed action sequeces but it is also the fact that the promoters, the advertisers and the brains behind this movie did not make the mistake of over hyping it. Too many movies have come before it, kicking and screaming before they hit the screen, raising expectations to impossible heights and then letting everyone down in an unbelieveable way.There wasn't much the T3 team let anyone in on, other than the villan was female and 2 acters weren't returning. Which leads me to my subject. Arnold. He's been lacking these few years, lets not kid ourselves. End of days was no Arnold movie, the 6th day was kinda watered down and so was Eraser. Jingle all the Way and Batman&Robin were jokes. So this is a very crucial movie for Arnold in this particular junction in his career. Hopefully he keeps riding off the waves of success created by this film and becomes more selective about the roles he accepts.T3 is all Arnold. Unquestionably the Arnold of old. We don't just see glimpses here and there like in his recent watered down roles. This is truely, purely, classic Arnold at his best. I am talking about Arnold in his coronation days for Conan, Predator, T2, Commando etc. Arnold Reprises his role well, looks good in terms of physical conditioning, and spits out great one-liners left and right. Speaking of his physique, it is astonishing but really not that surprising for a 55 year old to look that good, because he is after all a multi-time winner of the Mr. Universe contest.
So Arnold's huge, the movie is solid, the action is mind blowing, go see it! Don't let others stop you. You owe it to yourself and the last 2 previous movies to see this movie. In my opinion it is the best movie of the summer of 2003. 8 out of 10. Bring on T4.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
307,TheBabblingFool,Well they pulled it off!,9,6 July 2003,"I admit when I first heard T3 was in production I was moaning and groaning. I mean I didn't care that Cameron, Hamilton or Furlong wern't involved with the project, but I just didn't see the need for T3, it just felt like a safe bet to be a big pile of feces. This summer has been full of blockbusters that were way better than I expected them to be, X2, The Matrix Reloaded, Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle and Hulk were all blockbusters that were way better than I expected them to be. Now I can put Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines on that list!When I saw it during a sneak preview, I knew that I wasn't going to like it as much as Terminator 2: Judgement Day, because T2 has sentimental value (it was the first R rated movie I ever saw). What I got was a fun as heck movie with killer action and a fantastic ending.This film makes up for not having Edward Furlong or Linda Hamilton by having two equally if not more talented actors with Nick Stahl and Claire Danes. Both of them are very believable in their roles. Of course Arnold is perfect as the T-800 I mean it's the role he was born to play! Nobody could take this role but him, NOBODY!The new villian, the T-X works half the time. Half the time Kristianna Loken plays the character with a creepy, sadistic quality, and the other half it simply looks like she is mimicking Robert Patrick's performance as the T-1000 in T2. The T-X itself is a totally cool machine idea.As for the action...it will blow your mind. There is a massive car chase involving a crane which is spectacular. Then the best of the whole movie, and all out wall to wall fight between two Terminators! Watching Arnold and Kristianna throw each other around and through walls was so brutal and beautiful I was ready to give it a standing ovation. I wish we actually had cyborgs that advanced, because I want robot fighting as a sport after seeing the T-800 and T-X duke it out.The thing I love most about T3 is the ending. It's a real surprise ending, that is dark, and works perfectly. I am glad James Cameron didn't direct this film, because he wouldn't have had the grapes to do this ending.To sum it all up, in my opinion Terminator 3 is the surprise success of the summer. The film is better than the origional Terminator, yet not as good as Terminator 2, but still worth the price of admission. Now go out there and get terminated!",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
308,RoboRabbit89,A weak but fun third installment...,5,11 October 2017,"Arnold Schwarzenegger is back as The Terminator in ""Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines.""When I was 13 back in 2003, I first saw this and was quite blown away by it. I had to a least see it twice, but a couple of years later I started to sour from it. Even my mom said it wasn't as good as the first two films, and I had to respectfully agree it's not.However, recently a couple of yeas ago I have found myself starting to like this film again.This may contain some spoilers.The year is 2003. The newest nemesis from the future arrives in the form of a woman this time, The TX.She is here to eliminate John Connor's Lieutenants to ensure the machines victory.Later the Terminator arrives and teams up with a now adult John, he informs him about the TX and how he is not sure if he can defeat her, along the way they find a young woman that is a veterinarian and that her fate is linked to john's.With time running out, they quickly learn the young woman's military father is unknowingly about to activate Sky-net it's self. Which actives the rise of the machines.A weak entry in the franchise but usually third parts are, let me into the positives here.First I would like to say Arnold Schwarzenegger was great in his return to his famous roll. Even though this version of the character is a little less friendly form his T2 counterpart. Arnold was still cool as always.The action scenes were very good here, lots of expositions and gun battles. The vehicle stunt work is amazing and quite impressive with very little CG. Even the CG work is still good even by today's standers.Now for some of the negatives, now this dose not apply to everything else in the movie, just some things.Kristana Loken is OK as the TX character, however I mostly blame the writers for this. They just made her a sexy character that's all brawn and no brains. Not that I don't like her being sexy because I do, It would have worked out better if she was more scary and intimidating.Nick Stahl is OK as John Connor, but I feel ether he wasn't written well enough or if it was the actor I can't tell.Claire Danes is pretty good as Kate Brewster, but she wasn't given enough to work with.It has it's flaws but, I still think I does the job, it's still entertaining. I know some people sort of hate it like I did for a time, but It's a cupcake. It's a nice frothy cupcake and if you look at it as that it can be a wonderful piece of froth.I give it a 5.3/10 it's not bad more of a so-so action thriller, but it can be a real good time in the right mind set. If your a fan of the franchise give it a look.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
309,parhat,What the Community are Complaining,5,19 April 2005,"There has been a few edited parts of Terminator done by the internet forum community. So I will address this. The major theme that seems to hit hard and what the community has done was to re-edit the entire movie where the T-X original program was to upload the virus program onto the mainframe as one of the beginning sequences, and her first choice after that was to find John Connors FIRST, instead of running around shooting high school students which is what supposed to be after that. In fact the internet community, and I agree with them, is that Kate Brewster was an absolute drag to the entire movie and as a result was completely removed from the original movie remake done by this small fan community. Most people who are fans of Terminator aren't the kind of people who watch it once or twice, they can watch, 10 or 20 times. Whenever that is done several scenes become extremely irritating, too long or too short. They kind of stand out like a sore thumb. Those include, Arnie wearing Elton John's Sunglasses, T-X machine's breast size increase, and corny lines about ""I like your car/bike"", and ""you got a big gun"". Cheesy lines simply won't do. It didn't display any intelligence as ""I'll be back"" as in the original Terminator 1 franchise. Overall, if I have to see this movie, I really have to watched the re-edited version (done by myself or community) or it's a torture to watch. The biggest problem I have regarding Terminator 3 are: 1) John Connors is Stupid and way too weak 2) Kate Brewster's a real drag to the entire movie. and 3) T-X machine is too busy killing small cockroaches (e.g. John Connor's friend) instead of trying to find John Connors first or show she was uploading some virus program. The movie, I believe runs too short and the scene where the crane runs demolishing the city is way too long. It's an overkill and cheesy. The decision by Arnie where he wanted to add the extra scene was helpful when his body is crushed through the crane going in the building. Unfortunately the rest of the city demolishing is unnecessary. Kate Brewster scene can be eliminated entirely. There's no place for her in John Connor's life (romance with this woman is out of the question), at least for Terminator 3, because it makes John Connors look like a wimp. This is not just my opinion, but a opinion of a fan community that has to gross out and watch this movie over and over. Mind you, it's a minority who does this, but certain parts really are irritating. How would you like to see Arnie wear Elton John's Sunglasses 20 or 30 times like me? LOL.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
310,JAKastner,The Moose Hole - Terminator Rises Again,8,4 July 2003,"Let's say you're an average Joe. You have your favorite sports car, a fabulous job, your own house, a beautiful wife and a great family. You go through life without a care in the world. But these things won't last. Why? Judgment Day. Imagine a world of complete darkness where man's destiny is controlled by machines and super computers. Sound familiar? It should because this is the backdrop of the entire Terminator series. The original Terminator cost an estimated $7 million but went on to gross $40 million at the box office. It became so popular on video that Terminator 2: Judgment Day was created, helmed by James Cameron. With a production budget of $100 million, T2 went on to gross $204 million, so it was a no brainer to make another sequel, right? Well, it took them 12 years and a reported $175 million budget but T3 has finally arrived in theaters just in time for the 4th of July holiday. But will Rise of the Machines continue the success of the popular franchise or will this result in its fall?The story goes that the life of John Connor, the leader of the resistance movement that defeats the machines, is in danger once again. But this time he is not the only target. A T-X Terminator, the most advanced killing machine created by the Skynet network, has been sent to the year 2001 to kill the lieutenants of the future human resistance as well as John Connor himself. But John will be harder to locate because he has been living off the grid for nearly ten years. By having no cell phone, no home, and no real identity, the Skynet network is less able to track him down should the time come. Though he and his mother, Sarah Connor, prevented Judgment Day from occurring on August 29th, 1997 when they prevented the creation of the network, he still lives in fear that the end of the world still may come. He fears are correct as the T-X is looking for him but a T-850, like the one sent to kill him before he was born, has been sent by the resistance movement to ensure his survival. The events that occurred in T2: Judgment Day didn't prevent Judgment Day, it just delayed it. Within three hours, nearly 3 billion human lives will be destroyed in an instant. Now John Connor must team up with the Terminator and his future wife to try and prevent Judgment Day once again. The story for T3 is not as fabulous as the one done for T2 but with James Cameron not directing this time around, did anybody really expect it to be? Having the opening of the film focus on the thoughts of John Connor and then flash forward to a battle between machines and man was a good way to start off the picture. There are a couple of holes in the plot of the film that could have explained why certain things happen within the film but they really aren't a huge matter for the film. The ending to the film was also well done but more could have been shown.The only returning cast member from Terminator 2 is Arnold Schwarzenegger reprising his role as the T-850 Terminator that he made famous nearly twenty years ago. Once again Arnold works extremely well with this role. Though more of the character was done using CGI then in the other previous films, Schwarzenegger still provides an emotional voice to the character in those types of situations. Edward Furlong, who played young John Connor in T2, was dropped from the project when the studio believed that his drug and alcohol problems would delay production, so Nick Stahl was brought in to replace him in the role. Stahl is the not the perfect replacement but still does a very good job with the character. Kristanna Loken is the new villain in the Terminator franchise playing the role of the T-X Terminator, Skynet's most sophisticated killing machine. She is very plain with her emotion which is good since she plays a machine. The only problem with her character is the questions left unanswered. Her character is made of liquid metal but at one point during the film a part of her is damaged prevent the use of a primary weapon but the film doesn't explain why this happens. But that really has more to do with the plot then with her. Claire Danes rounds out the rest of the main cast as the future wife of John Connor. There weren't that many scenes with in the course of the film that really focus on her, which is good since John is more of the focus, but most of the scenes that she was involved in were well done. The introduction of her character and the whole idea of destiny (her and John meeting and eventually getting married) was a good twist to the story.Overall, Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is a good summer popcorn film. T3 doesn't even come close to the majesty of T2 and for several reasons. The dialogue is much less serious then T2 but this was to be expected with James Cameron not at the helm this time around. The plot holes presented in the film also hurt the overall effect. There is no clear explanation on what Skynet is exactly and how it is able to control the machines if there is no core. There are also unanswered questions involving how John Connor and the Terminator are able to enter a secret military area with no problems at all. This doesn't seem to really matter as all Hell breaks loose soon after. The film is also less dramatic then the first sequel and plays more for just action and laughs but that seems to work on its own level. There were many humorous moments in the film with some working like the statements made by the T-850 replying to situations that machines can't understand. But there were also moments that didn't work. For example, the T-X inflates her breasts to get the attention of a cop who pulls her over. This was unnecessary as the cop didn't even seem to notice. Besides some minor complaints, there are many things that work for the film. The fact that Jonathan Mostow makes this his own film instead of just trying to copy what James Cameron did in T2 is fabulous. The action sequences were well done and the special effects were just absolutely amazing especially at the very end of the film. Speaking of the ending, it was a little disappointing that the film makers ended the film the way they did but that allows them to follow up with a fourth Terminator film and not give away too much. T3 may not be the best film out there but it is still a great film to enjoy over the holiday weekend.My Rating: **** out of 5 (Grade: B+)",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
311,shakey_jake53,surprisingly good!,7,3 July 2003,"I went to see this movie today and I knew going in that it would'nt be as good as the first two film's since (1) James Cameron did not come back to direct and (2) both Edward Furlong and Linda Hamilton did not reprise they're original roles.  But after seeing it I was surprised that the film was actually pretty good.  The action scenes were pretty cool, especially the chase with the crane, and the acting was good as well.

312,RussianPantyHog,Bloody Awful!,1,28 March 2004,"In 1984 I lied about my age and sneaked into a cinema to watch Terminator. Wow! What a movie. In 1992 I saw T2 and was just as thrilled. They are both fantastic, so I was really looking forward to this. What a let down :( It's hard to find ""spoilers"", because there's no plot, though a lot of (gaping) plot holes. This film cost a fortune to make but it's SO bad it actually feels like a TV movie. Lots of explosions, but not much else. My biggest complaint is that it all moves far too quickly. There's no 'depth' to any of the characters and they all look as if they'd rather be doing something else. On the good side (thinking hard) Clair Danes is a very talented actress, though struggling with naff material. Arnold does look incredible for his age & it's staggering to think he was 55/56 during filming, but he sounds 'weary' and has none of the menace of the earlier films. As for Nick Stahl. Sorry Nick; you couldn't act to save your life. One particular line from big Arnie sums up this rotten movie for me: ""My CPU is working but I have no control over my other functions."" I honestly expected him to pee his trousers at that point. I'm glad to see most other folks thought T3 was awful and I won't even be bothering to see T4 when it inevitably comes along. It was sad to see Arnold Schwarzenegger end his movie career on such a low note.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
313,randomStuff101,"Not bad, but nothing compared with T1 and T2",6,18 July 2003,"Firstly I'll say that it's always fun to watch the Terminator, even if the movie around him isn't that great. His one-liners and antics are very funny, but he still seems just as tough in T3 - maybe more so than T2, and also wiser. He admits to having ""sub-routines in basic psychology"", and the results are humorous and a nice touch.Of course he isn't as dark and evil as in T1, but who could expect that anymore. He apparently still isn't ""allowed"" to kill cops or people - I suspect censorship, or typical Hollywood efforts at pleasing a wider audience is to blame for that. Doesn't matter. The story was interesting and used the familiar Skynet theme well. The way it all unfolded though is something worth criticising. Perhaps it was because an inexperienced Director was at the wheel, but it was all so one-tracked, lacking the substance, suspense, cinematography and skillful storytelling of T1 and T2. It would be tough to live up to T1 and T2, but that's what the filmmakers are paid the big bucks for right?
There were too many references to T1 and T2. I was hoping for more original and new ideas with things like the Terminator looking for clothes, stealing cars, and various other things. I felt a lot of the scenes were merely re-hashed ideas...a Hollywood cash-in maybe, on proven concepts.Unlike T1 and T2, T3 failed to be a good film when there wasn't action scenes going on. The effect this has is that you don't connect with the characters as much, because they aren't put in any decent non-action situations. Is the problem with editing? Story? Screenplay? I don't know, but what I do know is that T2 was an excellent film in ALL respects, but T3 was only good some of the time. I wish this wasn't so, but it's true.
Where is the creative filmmaking in T3? The answer is that, apart from some effects, funny lines, and a couple of action scenes, there was no creativity.T4 should be interesting though, can't wait! 6 / 10",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

However, I was extremely saddened as I sat through T3; a typically bad 'sequel film' with a lousy story line, actors going through their paces with little conviction and depending largely upon the success of the original two movies. Virtually all of the effects and action were a rerun from T2. In every respect, one of the poorest and most disappointing movies I have ever watched.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
315,Exiled_Archangel,"Typical sequel rip-off, but a GREAT COMEDY!",6,15 April 2004,"*** MAY INCLUDE SPOILERS ***
I was utterly disappointed with T3. Ok, I'm not a fan of Hollywood, and I pity those who are. But T2 was still special, and Arnold is more than just an actor to me, he's more like a god. But this flick.. If I were Arnold, I would break down and cry upon such a disappointing sequel to his T2, which happens to be one of the best sci-fi flicks of all times.
I think IMDB should add ""comedy"" to the list of genres for this movie. There are some scenes that are typicals of a successful comedy, and there are such amateur, impaired, and purely f***ed up scenes that try to be serious, but just make you laugh your ass off. Maybe a sci-fi flick cannot and moreover shouldn't explain everything in a logical way, but even that wouldn't make me forgive the huge error in this movie: Robots give humanly reactions and face gestures! WTF?!?! And the story is getting weaker and weaker.. I think if they try to make a T4, it'll be pure comedy. So I hope they don't try that, for the sake of not insulting the first 2 movies anymore.
Other than that, the things humans say, and the way Terminator answers them is simply hillarious! The dialogues, the questions and answers.. Everything!Claire Danes: Go to hell you asshole! - Terminator  : Unable to comply.Terminator appears out of the void and saves the heroes' lives among all the explosions and stuff, and says: I'm back. (Oh really? Are you? I thought you were front.. Blah!)How Terminator catches bullets with his teeth, how Kristianna enlarges her boobs (which I'd like to see in another setting *evil grin*) Give me a break! Those are too cheap even for a Hollywood flick!
Briefly, I couldn't stop laughing from the first minute of this movie until the last. And it doesn't offer much other than making you laugh in tears, so it qualifies as a perfect comedy. I had the feeling it would be disappointing like this, so I hesitated to watch it. But I couldn't bear the push, and rented the DVD. Do yourself a favour, and DO BEAR that push! Especially if you've seen T2 and liked it, avoid this one. Everything about this movie is just an insult to T1 and T2.A generous 6/10 for T3, and that's for the comedy part ;-)",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
316,Denver53,Disappointing; Shocking Lack of Originality,6,28 July 2003,"If you want to see T3, just watch T2 again and then add on five minutes worth of plot mythology development. Basically, T3 seems to exist to make money, instead of make money and take us meaningfully forward in the Terminator franchise. Let's see ... Terminator sent back in time to kill John Connor (and a few others, given lip service but no meaning)? Check. Other Terminator (older model) sent back to protect Connor? Check. War between humans and self-aware machines coming? Check. Car chases involving big, destructive trucks? Check. Bar scene where naked Terminator gets clothes? Check. Organization that will unwittingly allow self-aware machines to control nuclear weapons? Check.I mean, what was new? Very little. A minor philosophy change involving fate (Sarah Connor turns out to be wrong after all). A very brief bit of reprogramming that causes a good guy to be a bad guy for a few minutes. Even the fancy new Terminator is very similar to the new one in T2. It has an additional weapons ability and one minor wrinkle where it can control machines, but really, who ever thought a Terminator couldn't do that?That's just the beginning. This movie raises many questions about its own story. For instance, if it is so easy for the machines and humans to send machines back in time, how can this ever end? Why not send a Terminator back to 1961 and kill Sarah Connor as a child? Or kill her parents back in 1930? The franchise really needs to point out that this process is terribly difficult and limited.Also, John Connor knows how he will die. So now that he knows, why can't he prevent it? It's not like it is a random bomb. There is a very specific set of actions that must occur for Connor to die, and Connor himself must OK one of them. So why would he ever do it?T3 is very disappointing, and one of the most crass cash grabs I have ever seen from Hollywood.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
317,funky_cherry86,Schwarzenegger 's Back,9,19 July 2006,"After seeing the first two terminator films I couldn't wait to see the third installment in the franchise that made Arnold Schwarzenegger a hit. T3 lives up to the reputation of the previous movies with more special effects and action sequences than before.10 years have passed since John Connor (Stahl) helped to blow up Cyberdyne Systems and stop judgment day now 23 years old he lives a quiet existence, no credit cards, phone, address or home. He is trying to escape the future and his destiny meanwhile a new terminator called the T-X (Loken) has been sent to eliminate his lieutenants including Kate Brewster (Danes) who will be an important part of the resistance and later become John's wife. But another terminator called the T-850 (Schwarzenegger) has also arrived to protect both John & Kate and ensure their survival. However the terminator informs him that judgment day wasn't stopped and the inevitable will happen , the T-X is also after Kate's father Robert Brewster(Andrews) the original creator of Skynet that's the virus that's infected everything from computers to satellites and when the machines take control chaos follows. Nick Stahl's performance as John Connor was both electrifying and good. Linda Hamilton's replacement Claire Danes delivered a stunning and fearless performance as a future warrior 9/10",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
318,sampsonart,Did not leave a lasting impression on me sad to say,5,7 March 2021,"I can appreciate the director Jonathan Mostow trying to take on this film when considering the success of the first two.. Jonathan Mostow is one of my favorite underrated directors (Breakdown being one of my favorite films ever) but Terminator 3 just didn't do it for me. It was alright and had some great action sequences in it but something just didn't click with me. It's been awhile since I saw it in theaters back in 2003 and I hardly remember any of it.. I can remember almost every scene from the first two. I was super excited to see this when it came out though because hello, it's a Terminator movie and stars Arnold! But yea, just not memorable. Maybe I should give it another viewing.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
319,KillerLord,A Disappointing Addition to The Terminator Franchise,5,4 October 2008,"When the production of Terminator 3 was announced, the first shocking news that I found was that James Cameron was no longer going to be the director. The other surprise was that the villain was going to be a female. Yes, it was going to be a female cyborg played by Kristanna Loken. With these two facts known, I was convinced that one ought not to expect anything from the third movie. And then came a ray of hope or was it? Arnold continues with his role as the Terminator. Well, I felt there was something to cheer about after all since it is not easy to imagine anybody else playing the Terminator.When the trailer came out, I saw the clips of Kristanna Loken roaming almost nude in the streets and adjusting herself to look more attractive, I feared that the Terminator 3 was going to converge with the concept of Species movies i.e. a female villain moving around seducing men and eventually killing them. But thankfully, the movie was nothing like that and that was a relief for me, a big one indeed.Finally, the movie was a disappointment for me. Firstly, we start out with a lame script. Improperly placed dialogs, really bad! Arnold says, ""She'll be back!"" Arnold steps inside a lady's night club completely nude. The first goggles he wears are weird star shaped ones! What are the script writers thinking? Are they making a sequel or a parody? I could not understand! I don't know about others but I surely could not understand why the director and the writer put in what they did! And then we come to Arnold Schwargenneger. He was so convincing in the first two movies. Speaking in a way that was so robotic. That strict tone of voice that indicated near lack of emotion in the first two movies was replaced by a tone of voice that is more anger and frustration. Sometimes, one may feel that Arnold is more like a frustrated soldier who has been sent to do something much against his wishes rather than a cyborg who is programmed to do a task and is free from the very concept of emotion.For those of you who have seen the alternate ending of the Terminator 2 movie, you might realize that this ending does not allow the existence of this movie at all. But even when you choose to ignore the alternate ending of T2 where John Conner has become a senator and the Judgment Day has been prevented, you might not find the T3 as a worthy sequel.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
320,SILENCEikillyou,Arnold's still got it!,8,14 July 2003,"It's been too long.  But Arnold seems have only aged in his face.  He still is The Terminator all the way!  I enjoyed this film and greatly appreciated its ending.  That's all i'm sayin'.  See if you like Arnold Schwarzenagger as the Terminator alone; if you will.BUT see it for the hot new terminator, as well.  She did very well.  Some say her performance was too mechanical.  Um... hello???  'Nuff said there, i think.  She's very beautiful and cold looking at the same time.  Though she's a lot smaller than Arnold; she appears as a formidable foe to the ""obsolete"" T101 model.  Let's just say The Terminator had his hands full with this pint-sized beauty AND beast - The TX (Terminatrix).The actor playing John Connor delivered a very believable performance and didn't seem nervous next to the great Arnold; and yet he wasn't trying to over-act to compensate, either.  The two worked well together if maybe slightly less a father-and-son combo as the John Connor in T2.  Still, very well done!The 'other' girl in the flick was good, too.  I know i know her from somewhere, but she did just fine for the character she was and again didn't try to over-do it, at all.  You do feel sympathy for her and times and yet see why she becomes what she becomes in a post-judgment day world.All in all, i gave it 8 out of 10.  For such a long wait; maybe i wanted too much.  But it was a very good film and i like the chill in the end.thank you",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
321,Tyson14,"Terminator 3: Rise Of The Machines"" Rises To New Levels",7,19 July 2015,"The film picks up a number of years after the last feature as we see John Connor (Stahl), future leader and Saviour of the human race, in his mid twenties (I'd guess), living 'off the grid' since the events from the last film (if you haven't seen the previous two films I don't know what the heck you're doing here, but whatever...). Turns out 'judgment day' was not averted, as initially thought at the end of the 2nd film, but only postponed, as Skynet is around in some form, as indicated by the arrival of a Terminator robot, a model T-X played by Loken. It seems now the future is populated by really hot and sexy blonde robots with definite feminine characteristics...homina, homina...soon after we see another Terminator arrive, the muscled one we're more accustomed to, played by Arnold. Seems the T-X model, or Terminatrix Bot has been sent back to target Connor, but if it can't get to him, it's supposed to go after those who would be his lieutenants, including that of Kate Brewster (Danes), whose father, played by Andrews, just happens to be some military bigwig in charge of the program which will eventually become Skynet, the artificial intelligence that will eventually take over the world, exterminating the human threat. Make sense? Probably not...anyway, given this new threat, someone from within the resistance from the future decided to send back an Arnold robot to protect whomever needed protecting, but its task a difficult one given the sophistication of the T-X model, which is essentially an enhanced logic weapons systems cybernetic combat infiltration unit with nanotechnological transjectors inside a titanium battle chassis surrounded by a mimetic poly alloy...whew! So what does all that mean? Well, it can manipulate machines under computer control, tap into communications systems, and produce weaponry from within, including a wicked plasma cannon from its arm, among other things. Things aren't looking so good for John (or the human race, for that matter), but did I mention the Terminatrix is really hot?Given the fact Terminator 2 made as much as it did at the box office, I'm not surprised someone decided to continue on with the franchise, despite the fact the story had been pretty much wrapped up at the end of the second film. Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines does try to fit itself within the continuity of the previous two films, and, on the surface it succeeds, but once you start picking at the loose threads, there are inconsistencies (then again, when we're talking about time travel, who's to say what could and couldn't happen?). Now, I'm not going to go through and relate all the bits I thought out of place as I'm sure many have already done so, and done so a lot better than I could have, but I will say if you take this movie at face value (a straight up action film), you'll probably have a lot more fun. There was one bit that really bothered me, though, and that was when John, Kate, and the Arnold Bot were trying to contact Kate's father, who just happened to be secured away in some top-secret military installation. One minute they're driving towards the place and the next they're inside, talking to Kate's father...I suppose the Arnold Bot could have bypassed the security somehow, but it all seemed rather convenient, especially given the circumstances. I did like the whole bit about a widespread virus running through the Internet, where it came from, and its ultimate purpose. The characters in this film seemed to take a backseat to the action, as none are really developed as much as they were in the previous films. Perhaps the filmmakers were relying on the character development already out there from the earlier films, but given so few characters carried over, this didn't work out so well. One of the biggest weaknesses in the film, in my opinion, was that of Stahl's character of John Connor. There seemed to be an awful lot of inconsistencies indicating perhaps this wasn't the same John Connor as was in the previous movie. I'm not a big fan of Stahl (he reminds me too much of Giovanni Ribisi, whom I care even less for), but I thought he did pretty well in the film Sin City (2005). As far as Danes, well, she looked good, but her performance was limited by her role, as it was written. While the plot and the characters may have been half-baked, at least the action was balls out. My favourite bit involved a car chase sequence featuring a gigantic crane truck barreling through city streets, causing massive amounts of destruction. Another great bit was when the two Terminators were fighting each other within the military base, and the Arnold Bot uses a urinal as an offensive weapon. The first time I saw this film and the ending was presented I found myself saying ""What the f***?"", but, after watching it again last night it did seem to make sense in terms of the story presented. All in all I thought this a great action film, but in terms of a sequel to the Terminator series, it was so-so...I'd agree with Cameron that there really wasn't anything left to tell in the story, but if there's a chance to make money, you know Hollywood will capitalize.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
322,byrann_gowan,Honestly...,7,17 February 2012,"I liked this film. It wasn't as good as the original Terminator film, but it was popcorn entertainment, and for that reason, it was a decent film.So, for the plot: John Conner, played this time by Nick Stahl, now in his early 20's, is living as a drifter, when all of a sudden, he is once again thrown into the world he tried to forget. A Terminatrix, played by Kristanna Loken, has set out to kill John Conner, while the Resistance decides to send another T-101 to protect Conner. Notice how I didn't put who played the T-101? That's because I don't have to tell you, because we all know who it is. So, while there are different elements to the movie, it is kind of similar to the first two films in that a Terminator comes to kill John Conner (or, in the first movie's case, his mother), and someone, or something, also comes from the past to be the hero of the film. Same old, same old, but it's still entertaining.The actors did a good job. Kristanna Loken was quite sexy as the new Terminatrix who sets out to kill John Conner. Claire Danes is along for the ride as Kate who turns out to play an even more important role in the Resistance than even she realizes. Nick Stahl does a decent enough job as Connor, although he probably wouldn't have been my first pick. And, of course, who must come back to play the character we all know the most, but the Governator himself. Arnold's acting is kind of robotic, and while that seems like a bad thing, considering the fact that he does play a robot, it really works in this film.The one thing that makes me rate it lower than the first two films is that there were quite a number of times in which I actually laughed at some of the one-liners. While they were funny, they really shouldn't have been there. It kind of made me wonder why the film was rated R in the first place to tell you the truth. But, some of them were funny, so I won't detract too much points from the film for that reason.The action sequences though were top notch. This is the reason why I watched the film; I don't watch the Transformers movies for the acting because I know I'll be disappointed. The same thing kind of goes for the Terminator films, although the acting here is quite a bit better than that of the Transformers films. It is the action sequences that you want to see here, and so, if you go into this film expecting it to be about acting and dialogue, you might be a little disappointed. But, if you go in with popcorn entertainment on your mind, you won't be disappointed.All in all, though Terminator 3 by no means attains the pinnacle that was the second and the first movie, it is still a refreshing add-on to the Terminator franchise. An 8/10 for me.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
323,pootc,"Lacks direction, humanity and complex characters.",1,25 December 2005,"After over a decade of waiting, wondering what came next in the masterful Terminator franchise starring Arnold Schwarzenegger in his most famous and iconic role - Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines made it's premiere in 2003 but this time without James Cameron at the helm. In his place a competent action director in Jonathan Mostow (U571 and Breakdown) to continue the legendary mythology spelled out so meaningfully in the previous classics. No pity, no remorse - no fate but what we make, right? Wrong.Terminator 3 works as a stand-alone action film or straight up popcorn flicks for teenage multiplex hoards but as part of the acclaimed Terminator franchise it's an insulting, unintelligent and insignificant re-tread lacking direction, humanity and complex characters. If anything this devalues the franchise beyond recognition essentially back-tracking, rewriting and corrupting the mythology painstakingly established by James Cameron before trying to compensate for its lack of creativity with explosions and poorly placed slapstick humour.Its one thing to unnecessarily build upon another movie's story, but to rewrite the entire meaning behind another movie is just cheap and nasty. The story itself offered nothing besides the beginning of Judgment Day which was already the way we knew the series was headed and instead of moving the logical way, which is forward, the writers tried to implement bogus twists and instead took some rather pointless and dull steps backwards essentially reversing the entire mythology of the series.The notion desperately put forth in Terminator 3 is ridiculous, not to mention a complete repudiation of the themes and ideals spelled out so eloquently in Terminator's one and two. This is bad writing, tailored to suit an uninspired little story. How the writers felt adequate about avoiding the questions everybody has been asking for over a decade but more importantly how is it they live with themselves after re-writing the entire meaning behind such a classic mythology? 'Judgement Day is inevitable' is not an explanation. This one line shows how little talent, vision or depth the writers really had when put up to the take of writing such a large-scale film on their own.Now to character development and relationships. Terminator 3 missed so many opportunities to establish it's characters and established no atmosphere whatsoever. The score is as dry as a bone lacking little to no emotion like Brad Fidel's and if anything, anything at all the film should have emphasized even more on the character of John Connor. You know the saviour of mankind, the leader of the human resistance like Sarah in Terminator 2 but failed to because there simply wasn't any time to between the breaking of key scenes with slapstick humour by clown Arnold or more pointless action. The opening voice over with Connor was the only real development throughout the movie but can you really call that development? I'd call it an easy explanation. The opening voice over is all the insight you really get into the mind of John Connor (who gets his age wrong) and unfortunately its not enough to warrant a great character like Sarah Connor, though Stahl's performance was firm.How we went from the Terminator in 1984 to this is beyond me and while they may have the rights to the franchise but you'd think in having the rights to create such a high calibre film they'd first take the time to understand it and its importance. The writers (Brancato, Ferris) were completely void of any real new ideas and basically had re-tread old information with one original idea in mind for the movie, the oh so 'shocking' conclusion which was just another tool for yet another 'inevitable' sequel by these hacks who forgot to hold dear what Cameron's films made so memorable. 1/10",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
324,bbrasher1,BEST TERMINATOR YET,10,13 August 2003,"Before I got to see T3 last week, I was skeptical. At best, I expected a good summer popcorn cgi-laden sequel blockbuster-""been there-seen that"" type of flick. Fun to watch, but that's about it.I was pleasantly surprised. Much better than that overrated horse opera SEABISCUIT, that's for sure.Arnold still has it. Even at age 55, he is still Terminator material. (Whether he's Governor material still remains to be seen, but he can't possibly be any worse than Gray Davis). Anyway, Arnold, as a Model-T 101 is sent back to the present era to do battle with the latest model, the TX, or Terminex,(Kristanna Loken). Far more advanced and deadlier than the previous cyborg assassains, Terminex has been programed not only to take out John Conner, but his future wife Kate Brewster (Claire Daines)as well. What follows is the kind of mayhem not previously seen in TERMINATOR 1 or JUDGEMENT DAY. The two cyborgs manage to wipe out two city blocks with a giant tow truck, and later do battle in a men's washroom smashing each other with toilets and urinals (somehow, it's not as ludicrous  as it sounds). The ending itself was very well done-or not so well done, depending upon your perspective-either way, it leaves room for the possibility of a TERMINATOR 4, that is, if Arnold loses the election.

Claire Danes is likeable but is no Linda Hamilton.Okay, the movie itself. Right off the bat there is a glaring issue. John declared that even though Skynet has been defeated, he hasn't stopped running. Running? You're still in the same city, not that much on the run. You could have went to a different continent, make the terminators work to find you. By sheer coincidence, he happens to go to the vets where a girl from his school happens to work.

327,ichabod81,Good movie.,6,26 May 2004,"Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines cashes in on the expectations. This movie could have been a lot worse. Actually the only big difference to it's two predecessors is that the film's not even nearly as dark as Cameron's movies. It is a bit of a problem, since T1 and T2 were perfect borderline horror movies. Especially the original. T3 doesn't take itself as seriously which maybe would've been nice. That said, I must also state that this movie is not bad as a lighthearter Terminator film. It does play with the same serious issues as the originals and the suspense is very well build this time around too. If I'd be asked weather I would recommend this film, the answer would certainly be yes. Arnold is back to doing what he does best, Stahl and Danes are good in the supporting roles and Loken kicks a** as the T-X.

328,roystephen-81252,A very worthy sequel,9,12 February 2016,"Curious as it may sound, this is my favourite of the Terminator-series. It combines the relentless pace of the first film with the clever twists, emotional sensibilities and grand visuals of the second one, while it actually moves the story forward towards the unavoidable (?) end, unlike Terminator 2 (which I also like).Interestingly, Terminator 3 manages to be visceral and funny (oh, those sunglasses! - the humorous takes on the iconic moments from the first two films work especially well), light-hearted (almost family-friendly) and grimly pessimistic at the same time. So far, it is the only instalment in the series where there is no happy ending. Hope, yes, but humanity does fall here, nevertheless. You cannot escape your destiny.Kristanna Loken is wonderful in the role of the merciless terminatrix (kudos for the costume designers for her leather dress), as is Claire Danes as Kate Brewster, especially when she unleashes her anger.

Everybody is getting killed and there are no soldiers anywhere to be found. No security whatsoever.Then, why did Connor leave the base?

Does anybody actually understand the circumstances surrounding his death? It was not properly explained.None of this makes sense. It was a poorly made movie and as Cameron said, Terminator is a movie of the 90's. We've seen it all before and if they were going to make a sequel, they should have made one that made sense.

For me the Futuristic-Present sci-fi drama was told completely by the creator in Terminator 2: J D. This movie has not thing to do with the Terminator Franchise.The producers simply make this movie for milking the Stupid Hardcore Terminator Fans. But True Fans like us treat this Spin-off as a funny Forgettable Crape.Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (Spoilers******)""T3"" is the highly anticipated installment in one of Hollywood's most innovative and celebrated franchises, originated by writer-director James Cameron with the 1984 cult hit The Terminator. With the blockbuster 1991 sequel, Terminator 2: Judgment Day, Cameron redefined the science fiction/action film hybrid. This movie was from the minds of John Brancato, Micheal Ferris and Tedi Sarafian. From their story, director Jonathan Mostow raped Cameron's baby, by rechanging the last epic.A decade has passed since John Connor(Nick Stahl) helped prevent Judgment Day - the day Skynet's highly developed network of machines was fated to become self-aware and destroy mankind. But August 29, 1997 came and went without incident, despite Skynet's twice failed attempts to kill Connor and wage war on humanity. Now 22, Connor lives ""off the grid"" - no home, no credit cards, no phone and no job. No record of his existence. No way he can be traced by Skynet. Until..Skynet's most sophisticated cyborg killing machine T-X(Kristanna Loken) sent back through time to complete the job left unfinished by her predecessor, the T-1000. And she is exponentially more powerful, dangerous, destructive and beautiful than every Terminator that has come before her. But this time, Connor isn't the only target on Skynet's hit list - unsuspecting veterinarian Kate Brewster (Claire Danes) will see her distant past and promising present collide with an unimaginable future. When Connor and Kate realize that Judgment Day is rocketing toward them - with only three hours between them and the end of the world - their only hope for survival is a replica of the cyborg Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) Connor's mysterious - and now obsolete - former assassin. Together, they must forestall the looming threat of Judgment Day or face the fall of civilization as we know it.!By watching this piece of disaster I thought, for what reason this happened? Did Mario Kassar and Andrew Vajna get more Greedy this time? Or Arnold wanted a Cinematic boost before his political debut?First of all absence of James Cameron in every sense. His characters were treated badly, the Terminator punch lines were now reduced for comic relief, his visionary world turned upside down. The soul of the movie was seen as a big round hole when it comes to music. The absence of Brad Fiedel, in which the classic ""Clank"" sound gives the signature of Terminator, is thrown out in this version. The new replacement for Fiedel (Marco Beltrami) was the worst part after Mostow.Without Linda Hamilton, Edward Furlong, or even William Wisher Jr. (Cameron's co-writer) director Jonathan Mostow managed to bring a Science Fiction tale in a greater level and fails miserably. The early draft storyline was John Connor as a successful computer programmer, who ends up being instrumental in the activation of Skynet. Nick Stahl tried his best to bring up the matured John Connor who transformed as savior of the world but was not convincing. The Strength of all Terminator movies was that they had a strong villain but this one break that rule. The neither TX character nor Kristanna Loken has the charisma of the Dark Force which was portrayed powerfully by Robert Patrick & Arnold in the Original movies.The only strength to the movie was Arnold himself even though he agreed to do this lame chapter.

333,Gjay2,different but worthwhile,6,6 August 2003,"the first two terminator films are classics. so this third installment had a real good chance of ruining the whole effect. but i was actually suprised. although complex, the film actually fits with the story. and it leaves with something to think about as the end credits begin to roll. it's almost profound.it's no terminator 1, how could it be. and it's not even T-2 but i was 12 then, so nothing ever could be. but it is a damn good film. the action scenes are orchestrated just as good as cameron ever could have done. the actors are fair but nothing great. nick stahl proving the best as john conner. i suppose if you step back and look at it, it is different. john conner looks different and in a way, ruins the continuation. arnie now bears no resemblance to himself from T1, which makes it difficult to relate to the past story. but what i really missed. what i really thought should have been in the movie. was that great terminator score. not just the popular one but the theme they use during the chases of T2. if they coulda put that in over the action scenes here, it would've felt more like a terminator movie.but with these flaws, it doesnt stop you from enjoying what's on the screen. a slam bam action film that provides a thoughtful ending to the classic trilogy.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
334,Nigel St. Buggering,Color me surprised,7,9 July 2003,"With James Cameron's refusal to participate (is he going to work again?), and two of the lead actors bowing out as well, there was every reason to believe that this third entry was nothing more than a weak and derivative attempt to wring money out of a once-bright franchise.  Let's face it; Arnold's instincts haven't been netting him gold lately.  The dismal pre-release buzz didn't help its reputation either.  So imagine my surprise when this actually turned out to be a pretty nifty sci-fi action thriller.Is it a great film?  No; certainly not in a league with the first two films, which are now icons in the history of blockbusters.  There are two real problems holding this one back.First, there's Kristanna Loken.  I'll be the first to admit that I could sit in a theater and look at her all day.  However, that's not the point of the character, is it?  When it comes to sheer intimidation and menacing presence, she is no Schwarzenegger, and she is certainly no Robert Patrick (in my opinion, the definitive Terminator).  While I didn't find her unbelievable, neither did I find her frightening.  And that's a problem.The second stumbling block lies with the score.  For any discerning fan of the Terminator series, Brad Fiedel's score is the soul of the films. Without his innovative work, it feels as if the voice of the terminators and judgment day is gone.  Had he been replaced by someone like Jerry Goldsmith, the hole might have been filled.  But Marco Beltrami's score is merely adequate.  It hits its marks, and nothing more.  The action cues are rudimentary, and the rest is simply dull.  And the orchestral reworking of Fiedel's Terminator theme over the end credits is downright unwelcome.The bright points, however, are many.  While the film starts out with a bit of a ""been there, done that"" vibe, it builds very successfully.  Each successive minute is better than the last.  The basic premise set up at the beginning simply has to be forgiven and gotten past.  After all, if the future machines can send back Terminator after Terminator, why send each one back to a later point than the one before?  Why not go back earlier, or send them all back to same point to pool their efforts?  The movie isn't interested in answering these logic flaws, but fortunately finds more fertile ground in the characters.  This movie's greatest strength lies in the fact that it is not a movie about the Terminator, but about John Connor. The Terminator is merely an element that serves to delineate Connor as a character, and illustrate his struggle with what appears to be his fate.Which brings me to something I greatly admire here.  Cameron's films existed to illustrate the idea that the future is not written.  The mantra of ""no fate but what we make"" is repeated to make the point that the actions of the individual matter; an interesting point in a movie about nuclear war and the annhilation of the human race.  Well, this film will have none of that. It bravely reverses the stance of Cameron's stories, creating a starker, more realist view of the Terminator universe, in which common people can have no effect on events that shake the world.  It's a dreary philosophy, but it rings truer than Cameron's warm fuzzy approach.The action here is first-rate, and wisely continues Cameron's tradition of unorthodox chase sequences.  Why use fast cars when you can employ a crane truck and beat-up pickup?  The Terminator fights bring more of a superheroic element, and the use of CGI stand-ins is first-rate (the Wachowskis should be forced to watch these sequences repeatedly); they are used sparingly, and we are never allowed to see them long enough to give away the artifice.Another surprise is how quickly and easily Nick Stahl falls into the role of John Connor.  Perhaps it helps that the character was a young teen when last we saw him.  Stahl builds an adult who could reasonably have developed from Edward Furlong's teenager, and the references to the previous film manage to roll believably from the character.Warning: this might be considered a spoiler.  The ending cements the stark attitude of the film, demonstrating the inevitability of Connor's fate. It also provides the setup for the story that Terminator fans have been wanting to see all along, and that Cameron most likely would never have done.  The final lines provide the perfect pinch of hope set amongst the apocalyptic imagery, and actually leave you hoping for one more sequel.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
335,FluffyPantsReviews,Good but not great...,6,18 July 2019,T3 I enjoy more than most people do. Most of the actors are good to ok with the best being Arnold Schwarzenegger. The t-x is a cool villain Terminator with some cool abilities that is put to a good use. The one truck chase scene near the beginning is so good but needs some back ground music. The graveyard scene is pretty good and the military base sequence is ok but I love the bunker/hanger sequence at the end with the twist that Judgement Day is inevitable. A good entry in the Terminator franchise.,Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
336,gavinf-36675,Underrated,7,2 June 2020,This movie is the most underrated out of all the terminators it still might be the same concept but it really isn't instead of stopping a certain person it's a thing. A nuke. This movie is good and still a deserving third movie to the first 2 terminators,Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
337,Quentintarantado,"I like it, though ultimately I felt sad.",6,13 July 2003,"Some major spoilers in this comment. I left Terminator 3 feeling depressed, but that's a good thing. The story affected me just like the first one did.I was sad when Sarah Connor, pregnant, drove off into the desert with storm clouds building. I was also sad with the closing moments in this one, nuke missiles in pretty arcs coming down on the earth. It reminded me of the problems I had with the second movie. I didn't like Edward Furlong. His pleas to keep the Terminator alive in the end didn't sound convincing, like some boy whining. I like Nick Stahl better. But I do agree with others' opinion that the movie misses a strong character like Sarah or Kyle. It's a downer ending. After spending $170 million I think it's brave of them to keep it that way. On the other hand, it also opens the possibility of a T4, so maybe it's not brave but rather cunning of them. Mostow is pretty good. When John drops the beer bottle and that starts a segue to the future, when John rides the motorcycle and we barely see his face, or when they arrive at Crystal Peak and everything seems so dated, so ""Dr. Strangelove"" or even ""Colossus, the Forbin Project"" and finally, when I heard those last few lines, ""it was software, there was no core"". The movie won me over. I like this, maybe even better than the second one.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
338,jamesarooney,Terminator 3 a new take on the franchise,9,26 April 2019,Terminator 3 is a descent Film with has a heart to it. instead of a T-800 terminator its a T-850 thats battles the T-x and shes very creepy John Conner is 19 and its 2004 and John is not the target anymore. you will enjoy this movie and best of all Arnold Schwarzenegger really steals the show,Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
339,MinorityReporter,One of the worst action movies of the decade!,5,15 January 2007,"My first question in regards to reviewing this movie is 'why'. Why did they decide to continue a story that had been finished? Why did they not get James Cameron to direct? Why, why, why? Obviously the answer is money. They wanted to use a formula which generated big box office, which it did. Unfortunately this movie completely shattered the point of the previous movies, which is very hard to do. Usually when I talk about the terminator series I casually ignore this third installment about which is hard to say anything flattering.First of all following in the footsteps of James Cameron is a hard thing to do. After all Cameron wrote and directed the first two installments in the franchise and did a wonderful job. He created two of the best action movies I have ever seen. In comes Jonathan Mostow who has but a fraction of Cameron's talent. To be fair there isn't a lot Mostow can do with the material he is given. The script seems rushed and casually ignores what made the previous movies so successful. Why the heck wasn't Linda Hamilton brought back. Her character should be treated with more respect than this. Once again the movie never should have left the drawing board.Acting wise the film has taken a huge step down. Schwarzenegger received an enormous pay check to return in this second sequel and you feel the lack of interest from his part. His performance is the least of my concerns regarding the acting, however, and Schwarzenegger gives a decent performance as he still has the stiffness and commanding presence required to be the terminator. Nick Stahl is brought in to play John Connor and while not my primary point of critique he is still frightfully dull. I don't understand why they didn't just let Edward Furlong reprise the role. Claire Danes is equally dull and much of her acting seems forced and unbelievable. Stahl's and Danes' chemistry in the scenes where they bond is pretty stale and lifeless. You don't feel the tension there was between Linda Hamilton and Michael Biehn. My primary point of critique is in the choice of villain. Kristianna Loken's villain, T-X, has none of the menace that T-1000 had or that Arnold had in the first film. It's hard to get too excited in the showdowns between her and the protagonists, sadly.Effects wise the movie has also taken a step down. Obviously the effects are more complex but they have lost their edge. While the effects were impressive they were outmatched this year (2003) by The Matrix sequels and The Return of the King. Terminator has in one stroke been reduced to second fiddle and provides only adequate CGI. One misses the ingenuity of the effects revolving around the T-1000. Once again, what a shame.All in all Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is a massive disappointment and the series really deserved more respect than this piece of garbage. One of the worst movies of the year and definitely one of the worst action movies of the decade.3/10",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
340,RyanEberhart,Best of the Four (so far),9,28 September 2013,"Of the four Terminator movies this is my favorite. I like Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines because it actually tells the story of how the machines takes over. I get that the first two movies are an important part of the story but to me they were a shadowy prelude to this movie.The graphics are just as good, if not better, as the graphics in the second movie. And a hundred times better than the first movie. The premise of this movie is very well thought out, especially when the Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) explains that the apocalypse was only delayed not averted. The Terminator says that the apocalypse is inevitable.According to Internet Movie Database movie fans that have rated this movie has rated in on average 6.4 stars. I however, have to give this 9 stars out of 10. I gave it 9 stars because the evil Terminator was a woman this time, and she was hot. Also, there were many great scenes, even the one where the good Terminator has to get clothes. Yes, I know Arnold is naked in this scene and I shouldn't be talking about this, but it is funny that he goes into a local strip club... on ladies night. The Terminator scanning for appropriate clothing is hilarious. However, I did like the evil Terminator looking for clothes more to my liking.The three best scenes are as follows, at least in my opinion.The first scene I liked was the scene in which the evil Terminator (Kristanna Loken) tracks down John Connor's lieutenants, before they become his lieutenants. I don't like that she is killing these people. What I like is that she is so methodical and cold. The best part is when she comes to the animal clinic looking for Kate Brewster (Claire Danes), but finds John Connor (Nick Stahl).The next best scene takes place just after the first favorite. It's the chase scene where John is driving the animal clinic's truck with Kate in the back. The evil Terminator is driving a Terex-Demag AC 160, better known as a crane truck. The good Terminator is driving a motorcycle. The good Terminator is knocked off the motorcycle but ends up hanging from the end of the crane. However, he ends up getting knocked off the crane by a fire engine. The sequence of this scene is nothing short of remarkable.The third and final best scene is when the two Terminators are fighting at the airforce base Kate's father, General Robert Brewster (David Andrews), is commanding and in charge of Skynet. The fight scene is fairly awesome and a little drawn out. There is a breakaway scene that shows Kate and John escaping, Kate grabs a machine gun and shoots a mini-plane robot thing. Kate looks at John and says ""what?"" John replies, ""You remind me of my mother.""",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

Schwarzenegger returns as the T-850, as he battles the T-X whilst trying to stop Judgment Day from happening, along with teaming up with an adult John Connor.

It is so great, it is indeed the best movie of this year so far.  The movie is set 10 (I think) years after the last one, John Connor is now a grown man who escapes his destiny, but is found by the T-X, a female terminator with the most advanced technology ever seen.  But also, , the T-100 is sent (Arnold Schwarzenegger) to protect John and Kate Brewster. 
it' is an awesome movie, the best of it it's that it combines suspense, non stop action, some emotion and humor :)  Arnold delivers a great performance, as always.  Nick Stahl is pretty good and very convincing as John Connor, and Claire Dannes does a great job as well.  Especial mention to Kristianna Loken as the female terminator,  her character is very convincing and she manages to show a total lack of emotions and feelings, just the way a Terminator should be.  Plus the plot is great, the dialogs are clever and the many twists of this movie keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire movie!All of those who love a good action movie, and especially, love Arnold, see it!!!

346,eckhouse24,Arnolds Back!!!!!,10,13 July 2003,"Terminator 3 is fantastic. The best film of the summer and proves that Arnold still looks good in an action film. I'm not going to sit here and give you the plot, you can read that in the other posts. What I will tell you is that some of the people who bashed this movie are wrong.I first heard someone say that Terminator 3 is nothing more than a prequel to the Matrix. I beg to differ. The whole Humans vs Machines in the future came about in the first Terminator, back in 1984. If anything, the Matrix is just a sequel to the Terminator series, going beyond 2029, or 2032.
As for the comedic tone, I saw the film 3 times all ready, and each time I have seen it, all the jokes seem to have gotten a great response. As for the Action, I think all in all, people were treated to something more than a few slow motion kung fu scenes. Terminator 3 refuses to go the way most action films have gone. Having a movie directed towards a well choregraphed fighting scene. Granted, Terminator 3 seems to be missing about 20 minutes of film, which is why the story does seem a little rushed, but at this point in the series, we don't need much character development. We know John Connor, we know the Terminators, all we really needed to know was Kate Brewster, and we get all that information in the middle of the film...As for why Arnold doesn't shoot one person while carrying the coffin, all though in the past(or future) Arnold killed John, is it impossible to believe that Kate Brewster while reprogramming the terminator, programmed him not to kill humans.....Just an IDEAAll in all **** out of ****- This film delivers for me.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

348,jmcgee-1,T3 better than T2!,10,23 December 2003,"Now for those who are reading my summary might say,""What the hell is he thinking,T3 better than T2"".Well to tell you the truth I think all of them are the best,so I can't choose which one I like the most.But what makes T3 better than T2 is that it stays true to it's gene:Action.Now T1 stayed true to it's gene:Scifi and Action.T2 gene was action, but had drama in it which don't get me wrong it didn't hurt the film,it really made it great,but when I see a film I expect it to be in it's gene.T3 really stayed true to it's gene.I mean more action happen in the first 1o min of the film than both Terminators.Which in my mind makes it better than T2,also the ending really got me bad.And to conclude that Nick Stahl performance as John Conner was way better than Eddie Furlong.&#0;",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
349,mrrockey,Entertaining but Soulless,5,15 March 2014,"When it comes to sequels, third's not always the charm. In fact, it rarely is. For some reason, Hollywood can SOMETIMES get #2 in a series right but rarely #3. And Terminator 3 is, considered by a lot of people, not to be an exception to that rule. Fans seem to generally hate this one, calling it the first nail in the coffin for the franchise with Terminator Salvation being the next. But is it really as bad as people have claimed? Let's take a look and find out!The plot takes place seven years after the second film where Sarah Connor has died of leukemia and John now lives off the grid, like a homeless bum. Even though they destroyed Cyberdyne Systems and supposedly stopped Judgment Day, John still feels unsafe and paranoid that it'll eventually come and he'll have to fight for the fate of mankind. It turns out that Judgment Day was never stopped, only postponed as two Terminators come back in time, one to assassinate John, and one to protect him.I remember reading somewhere that Linda Hamilton was offered to reprise her role as Sarah Connor in this film but declined and called the script ""soulless"" and that pretty much sums up the entire film for me. While it's not as bad as a lot of sequels out there, or even that bad of a film in general, it just feels soulless and empty. Terminator 2 was really the finale of the franchise. They destroyed Cyberdyne and basically prevented Judgment Day from ever happening so there really was no need for a sequel at all.Speaking of T2, this film is also severely lacking in creativity. It basically rehashes all the same plot points of T2 except without Sarah Connor, and contradicting the message in that film(more on this later). Now, you could argue that since T2 borrowed a lot from the first Terminator as well, it's not that big of a problem but the thing is, T2 developed the characters further, it expanded the universe, and it explored the themes of the first film deeper. This film doesn't do any of that, it just uses all the same concepts and ideas except now, the message of the second film about how humanity isn't doomed by fate and how we can change it, is now replaced with ""it's destiny"". It could have been an interesting concept to explore, about how humanity is destined to destroy itself someday, but it just feels like an excuse to continue the franchise and make more money in this case.Okay, so I just basically tore up the film in the two last paragraphs but why don't I hate this film? Well, plain and simply, it's entertaining. While it's certainly not as thought-provoking as James Cameron's films, it still works as an action movie. The fights between the Terminators are brutal, fast-paced, and intense. There's a scene where they fight in a bathroom and they smash literally EVERYTHING in that room. It's so over-the-top, it actually becomes sort of funny at points. The pacing was fairly quick, never leaving the audience bored much and there's some decent suspense throughout(nothing compared to the first two, though). The film also LOOKS quite good. The cinematographer, Don Burgess, did a good job recreating a similar look to T2 and while the CGI isn't quite photo-realistic, it was used REASONABLY and there was a good use of both practical stunts and animatronics as well so I won't fault it too much for that.The cast is just sorta hit-and-miss here. Arnold is more emotionless this time around, no longer the caring father figure to John and it works since John is no longer a kid. Nick Stahl oddly plays John whinier as an adult than Edward Furlong did as a child but nonetheless, Stahl does a good job playing a man trying to escape his own destiny. Claire Danes does OKAY as Kate Brewster, but her character was just sort of bland and uninteresting throughout to the point where her performance was ultimately forgettable. Kristanna Loken is again, sorta bland and forgettable, which is a shame considering that she's the main villain of the film. She just lacks any sort of menace and isn't in anyway intimidating throughout the entire film and it really feels like she only got cast for the sake of sex appeal.Director Jonathan Mostow seems capable but he lacks the attention to detail James Cameron has and he doesn't seem to put the same level of nuance in his film. He just seems more interested in getting us to the next action scene and less interested in the human elements that made the first two films so fantastic. But the thing he seems to struggle with the most is humor. This film just goes way too far at times to the point where it feels like downright parody. Do I even HAVE to mention the part where Arnold gets his clothes from a male strip club? Thankfully, the humor gradually died down and became more subtle as the film went on.Overall, if you just want a fun, brainless popcorn flick that just happens to be a Terminator film, you'll enjoy it. But if you really want something meatier and more intelligent, than you should probably look somewhere else. This is just another Hollywood cash-grab sequel. Nothing more, nothing less. I'm gonna give it a 5/10.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
350,Hellrazr360,Awkward But Fun Twist To The Terminator Movies,10,12 February 2006,"By the time a movie series reaches its third installment the series is considered a disgrace because of the most recent addition. While some fans of the Terminator movies would like to ignore what Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines has to say it's still an exciting watch.Unlike the previous Terminator films, T3 puts the focus on big-bang action scenes rather than storytelling. In the regard of its action, T3 is a real thrill ride. From the opening sequence revealing a short but impressive look at the nuclear war to the inevitability set for Judgment Day, T3 serves up a good pace of tension-filled and occasionally humorous action. Not only do these scenes make T3 worth watching multiple times but it also gives the movie the extra points it needs to be above-average, and even a great movie.However, T3 makes compromises a strong story for these impressive action scenes. This will immediately turn Terminator fans off as the previous Terminator films were smart and took the time to develop a strong storyline. While the plot in T3 isn't necessarily bad, it makes a big mistake right from the beginning: Being made in the first place. Since T3 was made it was inevitable that the producers intended for Judgment Day to still happen, it makes the costly choice of taking T2's excellent ending, laughing in its face and tossing it away.With that, T3 is, on paper-a typical action flick with a mixed up plot tossed in. While the idea of making the ending of T2 pointless by its own rules is a big mistake, T3 still comes out strongly for what it is. This is one of the sci-fi movies that comes out as an exception to the standard that action-focused movies suck. Part of this is because that it still holds on to the formula of Judgment Day set by the first Terminator. But this rattles the viewers as T3 teases us with the idea of another Terminator movie that, if made, would be the real Judgment Day movie.So all things considered, T3 isn't a bad movie. In fact, it's actually a great movie as it has some cool and awesome action and does stay true to the original Terminator formula. Just that T3 makes the risk of even being released by toying with T2's ending about stopping Judgment Day that it loses points. Otherwise, T3 is a movie that regular Terminator fans will more than likely enjoy for what it's worth and under the flow movie sequels usually follow.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

352,elu5iv3,Great action movie,8,17 July 2003,"Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines: 8/10At last, the movie I had been dying to see was released in Australia. Having seen the first two Terminators, but having forgotten most of what happened, I only had a vague idea what to expect. I liked the twist early on, which takes the story in a different direction than what the trailer may have suggested. This is everything an action junkie could want. It has great explosions, good battle scenes (way better than the overhyped fights in ""The Hulk""), but also has a good storyline. The comedy wasn't as intrusive as I thought it might be, and was pretty well timed. A lot of it was acceptable because it featured Arnie running off believable, but still comedic robot lines (although there were exceptions, the craziest being ""TALK TO ZE HAND!""). The female Terminator was BADASS, just relentless in her search, and NOT the blatent addition of sex appeal that she might have been. Without spoiling anything, this movie had one of the best last quarters in any recently, and the ended was almost mind-blowing and perfectly set up the next (and possibly last) installment of the series. As for the acting, it all seemed fine to me. Kristanna Loken was perfect as the T-X, and I liked the way she never ""broke character"" and threw off some stupid line. Arnold Schwarzenegger was as you'd expect - he can't act very well, so this role is perfect for him, where he can BE a robot, rather than unintentionally acting like one . Claire Danes was fine as Kate Brewster, though replaceable. My favourite role was Nick Stahl as John Connor, he was really good and convincing.

353,josephrygaard,Before Watching: Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (2003),6,14 September 2019,"""Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines"" (2003) is the third movie in the Terminator franchise. If you want to get as much out of it as possible, there are a few things you need to keep in mind before watching:Absolutely first of all: sorry to say, but this movie is far away from the quality of the first and second Terminator. If you hold them dear, think twice whether you really want to see this movie. If you still do, keep reading.Terminator 3 aims for the same level of action extravaganza that Terminator 2 had, and while it doesn't reach quite the same height, some scenes are fairly thrilling and can certainly satisfy cravings for guns and explosions. However, that is about the only positive aspect of Terminator 3, as the rest of the movie doesn't come close to the same cinematography, special effects, characters or emotions as the previous installments. It is all over the place.The most disappointing downside is the lack of charisma. John Connor in Terminator 2 has now become a homeless, college drop-out burglar who is roaming shops for some easy booze and painkillers. The new Terminator is a very sexualized femme fatale whose liquid metal body can fire laser rockets. The other protagonist, Kate, is mainly there to ask questions and push the narrative forward, and our beloved Schwarzenegger does his best in trying to live up to his former glory. Terminator 3 is very much like any other action movie from the early 00's, and suffers from uncharismatic characters with very small arcs and very little dynamic.Nevertheless, the action is acceptable. But Terminator consists of so much more.My personal grade: a displeased 6/10. If you found this helpful, check my profile for more reviews.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

This film is so much better than T2. I know it's devoid James Cameron and some feel that this film lacked his vision and leadership. But somehow, I feel that Cameron has lost his ability to tell a story without a $100+ Million dollar budget. I like this story because it relies on and clings to the original premise unlike the second film. To me, T2 was all about eye candy and had very little to do with story. T3 returns to the gritty hard-core reality of a post-nuke world at war against SkyNet and the machines. I get chills at the end. I also love the return of the Love Story element. The first film is a love story as much as it is an action film. THat element was totally lost in T2.

356,HunterDK,Good action without the atmosphere from the previous Terminator-movies,6,23 July 2003,"Arnold is back as the Terminator, but this time it is not with the same success as the previous.I liked the first two movies, and I also like the actor Arnold Schwarzenegger. Anyway, I feel that three people really have created the Terminator universe, and these three people are Arnold, Cameron and not at least the composer Brad Fiedel. The last two were missing in this third movie, so I was very sceptical of this one.The movie was entertaining though, so maybe I should not complain, but I was not impressed. Kristanna Loken did an acceptable job as TX, but it was not as good as Robert Patrick as T-1000 or Arnold's previous performances.A thing that I did not like in this movie was that the Terminator was made a bit comical. It was fun to watch some of the scenes with the Terminator where he did some funny things, but it was more like a take-off of the old Terminator. It created a dilemma, I was entertained, but at the same time I was a bit frustrated, that the movie was not serious like the old Terminator-movies by Cameron.Compared to the old movies this movie is not like them. The movie does not have the ideas of James Cameron and the music of Brad Fiedel, I missed them both. A last thing that I missed was Arnold as the Terminator, I did not feel he was a cyborg/robot, maybe he missed the instructions from James Cameron.I may sound very disappointed, but that is not quite true. The action was maybe the best ever filmed, and the story was acceptable. The atmosphere from the old Terminator-movies is however missing, and you will not get the same feeling when watching this one.I would rate it 6/10.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
357,headfulofghosts126,A shadow of its former self,5,5 July 2003,"To each his own, but I cannot believe there are so many positive reviews for this movie. Doesn't anybody care that underneath the action and special effects there was nothing going on in this movie??? From Hollywood that's nothing new, but I thought Terminator fans had grown to expect more than that from these films. You can blow up as many things as you want, if I don't care about the characters on the screen than it's pointless.
Look, the action scenes are nothing short of breath taking. Probably some of the best ever captured on film. That's about all the movie has going for it. The so-called story contradicts rules and plot points made in the first two films. There's never even a logical explanation of why T3 even occurs. Every time someone's about to explain that, or something else of importance, they either end it with a one liner or someone interrupts them. Lazy screenwriting. I don't mind them changing the theme of the movie, too bad they didn't change anything else. This is T2 with a woman and no subtext. The subtitle was fitting since like a machine, the movie was cold and emotionless. The humanity the was stressed in T2 is completely missing. Those of you calling this the best in the series need to rewatch the second film. Why is it nowdays that the minute a budget goes over $100 million, all semblance of originality, character development, and logical thought goes with it?This is not a Terminator film. This is a very expensive fan film that almost parodies its predecessors. Like Friday the 13th or Halloween, they turn the character into a cartoon. They actually make a fool of the Terminator. You laugh AT him. Way too much humor that just doesn't work.
Before seeing this movie I thought T2 had wrapped everything up and there was no need for a third. After seeing it, I KNOW there was no need for it. The only thing it was successful at was showing me what a skilled director Cameron is. This is crap, folks. I can't be nice about it. It was just a bad, bad movie that played its audience for idiots. The last line is a slap in the face. It's an insult to the intelligence of movie-goers.
Everbody complains about the state of the movie industry. Then everyone fills these boards with positive reviews of crap like this. Only reassuring Hollywood they're making the right decisions. T3 may be bigger, louder, and faster than the first two but it's also a lot dumber. You can put the body of a ferrari on top of a Toyota, but just bc it looks good doesn't mean its worth getting into.And Arnold clearly needs Cameron to bring out the actor in him. Thanks for ruining the Terminator guys. One more thing I loved that Hollywood's 'Nothing Sacred' attitude has ruined.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
358,jordanthomas_2009-346-914758,A Good Three-quel,7,14 July 2018,"Terminator 3 (2003) ReviewFollow up to T2 several years after they prevented Judgment Day John Connor is in his mid twenties and his mother Sarah Connor has passed away. Nick Stahl replaces Edward Furlong (most likely due to his recent drug hiatus) Stahl is actually quite good in the role. He plays him as a conflicted lost person who has nightmares about the apocalypse. Arnold is back and remarkably hasn't aged a day since the twelve year gap from last film. He once again plays the good terminator but this time to protect someone else too. Now of course Arnold is brilliant in the role, he was born to play this character and he always gives it 100%. The film elevates every time he's on screen. The villain is female but this time is a step back from the last one. The T-X played by Kristina Loken isn't as terrifying as the other villains but is still very deadly. She seems like downgrade as she has an exo-skeleton with a liquid metal exterior but thankfully she can still imitate other people. We all know that exo-skeletons can be destroyed a lot easier than the T-1000 which was purely just liquid metal. But there are a few interesting things to her in that she can manipulate machines and vehicles to wreak havoc and she also has a built in gun which looks really cool. Director Jonathan Mostow who previously helmed the Kurt Russell thriller Breakdown does a more than average job here. It's clear he wasn't in full control with so many producers breathing down his neck telling him how to make the film. He does his best with the often silly script by John Brancato and Michael Ferris. One thing he delivers well on is the action sequences. T3 is full of great action scenes from two chase sequences, a police hold up which goes awry and an exciting bathroom fight. However some of these action scenes are exaggerated to the max with some of them going on for far too long like the bathroom fight and the first chase sequence. There is an awful lot of CGI - One scene where the terminator has to reconnect his head would have looked a lot better had it been done with animatronics. The bathroom confrontation between the two terminators also looks very cartoonish at times. There's a nice use of practical effects in parts but it ultimately relies on some often dated looking CG animations. The majority of the time it delivers but there are too many self deprecating moments from the often cartoon like sound effects and the constant self referential gags to the first movies. There are a few dumb character moments, some annoying characters and it's peppered with one too many cheesy one liners like ""Talk to the hand"" and ""I like your gun"". But the film redeems itself running at a brisk pace of 100 minutes it has some good character interactions, effective action scenes, great cinematography and a surprisingly sombre ending. It's not a classic like the first two but it's far from terrible.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

360,mbanwait,An above average action flick that embarrasses the franchise,6,11 November 2003,"T3 is a pretty good action movie with enough destruction to sustain the movie.  But, the movie falls much short of the epic scope which was provided by T1 and T2.  Jonathon Mostow does a commendable job of keeping the pacing tight and action high, but does very little with the story line.  It is essentially a retread of T2.In addition, I can forgive Mostow for using way too many absurd jokes at the expense of the Terminator in order to get a few chuckles from the audience.(Talk to the hand?!!  Elton John glasses?!!)I don't think there could have been a better action movie made than T2. The only man who could have attempted to undertake T3 and make it as good as its predecessors would have to be James Cameron.  But I believe Cameron opted out because he knew himself he could not do it and did not want to dissapoint the audience.On the plus side, the movie does seem to get better and better as you progress to the end.  The crane action stunt is absolutely amazing.  And we have to mention Arnie.  The man is and forever will be remembered as the Terminator. The TX again is a passable advesary, but Robert Patrick's T1000 will be remembered as the best villian from the Terminator series.I think this movie is definitely a rental. Not much on the DVD and the flick does not warrant multilple viewings ala T2.  I am sure there will be some sort of triple deluxe super edition in a couple of years just in time for Governor Arnie to make a come back in T4 fresh in his Golden years.6/10 /mb",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

I was really hyped up to see Terminator 3..and trust me, Terminator 3 is no let down.  It is the only movie that made me leave the theater wanting more, feeling good and feeling generally excited, even after seeing the movie.  It was just that good.  The action was unbelievable, better, in my opinion, then the action in Matrix Reloaded.  The movie cost 180 million to make and it definitly shows it.

But there was one problem, EVERYTHING WAS TOO EXTREME! Almost everything seemed impossible! Something like the T-X can never exist! I mean a combination of liquid metal and a robot! It's impossible to create such a thing. Even for 2029, it's still extreme. Arnold was the best character and stole the show. The sexy T-X made a great appearance and I give this film a 7. Where's Cameron when you need him? The problem with the second milleniumm, is some of the movies. Matrix Reloaded was horrible! I hated it! X-Men and X2 were fantastic! Spider-Man was awesome!

The first two parts of the story were darker, true, and better - for this there can be no argument; but this is still a great action scifi movie, full with cynical humor, jaw-dropping action and very good visual effects. The actors are decent, especially Arnold who is as good as ever. The story is a little bit stupid, because it basically ignores the message of the 2nd movie, but it is enjoyable and entertaining. The final of the film is really great, though. In conclusion - not on the level of T2, but very good indeed.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
364,Sisiutil,"Recommended, but with qualms",7,16 July 2003,"SPOILER ALERTAfter the slimy abortion that was Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle, my wife had a dickens of a time convincing me to take in ANY more summer action sequels, including T3, even though we're both big fans of the first two films. Eventually, she won me over, and I'm glad she did. I enjoyed T3--even though it's merely good and not nearly as great as its predecessors.There was a lot to like here. I liked the two young leads, and found both characters' development from what they are at the start of the film (John Connor's a mess; Kate Brewster's a mousy vet) to what they are at the end (future leaders of the anti-machine resistance and soon-to-be lovers) wholly believable and deftly accomplished. I especially liked the irony of how it took a machine--one of his future main enemies, a Terminator--to make Connor accept his destiny as leader of the resistance to those very machines.
I also thought the downer ending was incredibly gutsy for a summer action movie. The heroes don't win! Well, eventually they will, we're told, but that's not what we're SHOWN. And Arnie--how can you not love the Teutonic Titan in the role he was born to play? Favourite line: ""I'll drive."" --delivered to a group of shocked firefighters. And it's extremely well-paced, especially once the threat of Skynet's activation comes into play.Nonetheless, the film has some serious problems, most of them revolving around the bad guy...uh, girl. The Terminatrix was the weakest element here. First, the obvious: as an actress, Kristanna Loken is a good model. She has nowhere near the screen presence of Arnold or Robert Patrick. When Loken flatly delivers the uninspiring ""I like your car/gun"" lines, you can't help but recall Robert Patrick's wonderfully creepy ""Say...that's a nice bike..."", not to mention Arnie's immortal ""I'll be back.""Second, the concept is weak: she can form advanced weapons with her hands? So what? The previous villains in this series were viscerally terrifying: the unstoppable, scowling, hulking Arnie in T1, who got scarier as his skin came off and that metal skeleton got revealed; and creepily friendly Robert Patrick, shape-shifting his liquid metal body into those ugly, brutal ""stabbing weapons"".  Third, T3 showed some lazy, sloppy work on the part of the writers when it came to our villainess. It's a bad sign when I get those ""What the f...?"" moments DURING the movie. Here's a couple of examples of what I'm talking about:1) Kate's hiding, terrified, breathing AUDIBLY, in her vet clinic, and Terminator Barbie CAN'T HEAR HER?!? Come on, she's gotta have some advanced auditory sensors, and infra-red to boot. My wife suggested the T-Barbie got distracted by John Connor's presence, and realized how ridiculous that was as soon as she said it. Hey, she's a super-advanced COMPUTER, I THINK she can MULTI-TASK. Simple solution: Kate just happens to hide behind a big, noisy fridge. You've got a technically savvy audience here, guys; don't insult our intelligence.2) John, Kate, and Arnie are driving away at the end of the early, nearly-interminable chase scene. T-Barbie watches them go, the back end of their Toyota truck in her sights...uh...HELLO?!? I thought this chick could form advanced weaponry, but she can't pick off a TRUCK at 200 yards?!?3) T-Barbie goes right through the super-accelerator control room without noticing it's turned on or figuring out (super-computer, remember? Advanced AI?) what its powerful magnetic field will do to anything METAL once it reaches full power. And Arnie says she's smarter than he is?
All in all, if I had a choice as to which of the three Terminators I'd rather go up against, I'd choose this ineffectual little minx any day. Fortunately, about half-way into the movie the nebulous Skynet becomes the true villain and its impending activation creates the real suspense.T3 does end up being a largely intellectual exercise, which is remarkable for a summer action movie, granted. But it wasn't as emotionally compelling as I'd hoped. First, Sarah Connor/Linda Hamilton deserved a BIG death scene where she gave her life for John. (And the mother-in-law-to-be-with-biceps-of-steel-and-an-uzi stuff would have been fun!) Second, when John Connor accepts his destiny, you should want to stand up and cheer. Instead, I was left walking out going, ""Well, that was interesting..."" It's good, even satisfying, but not great. You can't help wondering how Cameron would have done it better. 7/10.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
365,drunken_critic,Maybe part 4 will be better,9,21 November 2003,"I came into this movie looking for a post apocalyptic fight against robots. I would have loved for the movie to open with Armageddon.   Nope, it was not like that.  It ended up being about the pre-apocalypse.   Once again Terminator robots are sent to the past to terminate John Conner and his future helpers.  In other words this movie is exactly like T2, but the only difference is they chase John 10-15 years later.  Instead of trying to kill his mom, they are trying to kill his future wife.That is kind of disappointing.  I really would have loved to see John fight the robots in the future.  Well hopefully James Cameron will be brought on to direct T4, The final battle.The movie itself was a great action picture.  The special effects were awesome.  Very memorable was the chase scene involving a crane, a motorcycle, police cars, ambulance, and a fire engine.Question how did the female terminator control the vehicles during the chase scene?  A car's acceleration and braking is not computer controlled.  In the movie you see the gas pedal being pressed down by the terminator even though she is not in the car.8.5/10 (I only gave a high review because of great special effects), but then again I am the drunken_critic.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
366,medic249a2,Impressive,8,14 February 2005,"While I had been hoping that James Cameron would be back to repeat his fine work with the 'Terminator' series, I was not disappointed with Jonathan Mostow's version of the latest installation. The only thing I would have added was the start of the future war - in the post-nuclear-attack world, where the human resistance starts to fight the horrifying machines of Skynet.In this latest addition to the Terminator series, the CSM-101 (Schwarznegger) returns again to protect John Connor (Stahl) - now invisible & untraceable - from Skynet's latest assassin droid, the T-X (Loken), a frightening machine with multiple onboard weapons and the ability to control other machines from a distance. Additionally, Skynet has already begun its stealthy takeover of computer systems, in the guise of a computer virus. In a series of frightening and near-lethal encounters, John meets up with his future wife and co-leader in the resistance, Kate Brewster (Danes). With the T-X unable to locate John, she starts by going after future prominent figures in the resistance, one of whom is Kate's dad, an Air Force General in charge of Cyber Research Systems - which includes Skynet. They also discover that it is too late to stop Skynet from starting the horrible nuclear war that is the prelude to the war between Skynet's machines and the human resistance. However, they decide to try to at least protect General Brewster from the T-X, as the Terminator reveals he is an important resistance figure - making him a main target of Skynet's assassin droid. When they reach CRS, they discover that General Brewster's bosses in the Pentagon have lost all control of their military, courtesy of the Skynet virus that has cut them off. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs has ordered Kate's dad to uplink Skynet in the hopes of killing the virus. Despite Brewster's reluctance to do so, he complies - and Skynet takes control of ALL the U.S. military, including the nuclear subs and missile silos! The T-X appears and guns down General Brewster, but he escapes along with John & the others to his office, where he warns Kate & John to head to Crystal Peak - supposedly the system core of Skynet. John & Kate escape to the hardened facility and enter, aided by clearance codes carried by Kate's dad. After a narrow escape from the T-X, in which she meets an ugly end, they descend several hundred feet into the mountain to discover it is nothing more than a command center for General Staff and VIPs. The President, Congress, Cabinet and Joint Chiefs never got the warning, however, and John & Kate are alone in the structure. Seconds later, alerts pour in from all over the country, as Skynet launches the USAF's ICBMs against targets in Russia & China. In a frightening end sequence, missile trails criss-cross the sky as Russia & China launch their counterattacks, and all over the world nuclear mushroom clouds erupt. Judgment Day has come - and soon, the war against the machines will begin.Despite the lack of an 'opening' sequence about the future war, it still leaves open great potential for a Terminator 4. The characters of the future war are introduced to us in a way that makes them believable and real. It will be interesting to see how the CSM-101 Terminators figure in the future war - we are given some hint of this in future war sequences that show huge platoons of CSM-101s deploying from Skynet bombers against the human resistance. Bring on Terminator 4!",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
367,foxhound-37781,Action scenes are entertaining but that's all there is to like....,5,25 June 2021,"The best thing about T3 is easily the action scenes they are well done and entertaining but the complete disregard for the previous films plots (and lack of James Cameron for that matter), is what stopped this movie from being truly what it could have been... It's nowhere near as lame as Genisys and Dark Fate which completely chewed up the franchise and spat it out down a five thousand foot deep mine shaft so with that out of the way I'm quite comfortable at least giving this movie 5 stars for it's solid attempt at an action film...The biggest problems I have with T3 are the rehashed ideas. In Judgment day, Arnies terminator spawns in front of a bar, where he gets his leather outfit off a biker, in T3 he spawns in front of another bar where he gets his leather outfit off a male stripper.... Seriously why are Cyberdyne's terminators attracted to bars? Also in T2 the T-1000 is able to immitate other human beings and form stabbing weapons with its arms, in T3 the T-X is able to imitate people (mainly Katherines fiance), and she is also able to make stabbing weapons with her arms/hands... The T-X also spawns in the middle of LA at night and there's literally no traffic around? Have these people who made this film even been to LA? That city is astoundingly busy ALL THE TIME!!! There's no way downtown LA would be that dead quiet....And then we have John Connor who's character persona has been completely destroyed, He falls off his bike, hitchhikes back into town and the first thing he does is breaks into a vet where he just starts randomly popping pills that are obviously medication for animals... Is this the best way they could introduce his character for T3? Making him out like a junkie drifter who does break and enters in the early hours of the morning?My number one biggest disappointment is lack of Sarah Connor. T3 kills her off, we don't see her die but midway through the film it's explained she died of Leukemia and the only thing she left John in accordance with her will was a coffin full of guns? Seriously what time constraint were these writers under for doing this movie? It's literally like they were given nothing more than a weekend to write the script.A disappointing continuation of the storyline and the character development if anything has gone backwards, but there's worse sequels you could watch than this.

No, it bothers me because it makes no sense. John says in his closing narration that Skynet no longer has a single, central location. It has dispersed itself over the internet into millions of computers. Fine.Except I'm fairly confident that the internet would stop working in the event of a global nuclear war.Most of the computers in the world, like most of the people, are in cities. And those computers would be destroyed along with everything else in those cities when they were nuked. Not to mention that most of the infrastructure that connects those computers would also be destroyed.Most of the computers that were not physically destroyed would be rendered inoperative by the EMPs from hundreds of nuclear detonations. Not to mention that most of them would lose power as well.Skynet is a computer program. It can't survive without electricity, and a computer with enough memory to contain it. If it dispersed itself across the internet, and then nuked most of the technology that makes the internet work, it would essentially be committing suicide.That's my two cents about that.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

I think they are nuts. This is a very fine movie, and a very fine part 3 in the saga. Danes and Stahl are excellent. There is good character development. The occasional humor was excellent. The chase scene with the crane vehicle was superb -- maybe the best chase scene I've ever seen. I've seen this movie at least 3 times, but that chase scene always keeps me on edge and gasping, probably because it's believable. Yes, I know that isn't really what would have happened if the hook had caught on something down in a manhole, but so what? It's a movie for goodness sake. Other critics here have compared T3 unfavorably to The Matrix. Sorry, this movie is far better than the Matrix. Half the time I couldn't figure out what was going on in The Matrix. The fight scenes with the slow motion figures pivoting around are just silly and unbelievable. Furthermore, the basic premise of the Matrix series of movies is unbelievable. The events here in the Terminator movies are much more plausible, like good science fiction always is. The Matrix is more like fantasy, almost like Harry Potter (ugh).No, it's not as good as T2, but so what? It's still very very good.henry",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
372,obiwan2005,He's back...,9,15 July 2003,"When I first heard they were making 'Terminator 3' without James Cameron (the first two's co-writer and director) I immediately knew that this movie wouldn't come close to the the perfection that was 'Terminator 2: Judgment Day', a movie that in my mind is one of the greatest films ever made. So I put that out of my mind. But as the film neared release, I gained an excitement I didn't think would generate from the film. I became excited about it. It looked good. And while I didn't really think about it as the movie was being made, I had suddenly felt that this movie would be good enough to be recognized as a true edition to the franchise. Even with new writers and a new director. And my feeling paid off. While not as good as 'T2', the film is very impressive in its own right. Questions about the sequel were being answered. Like, why would more Terminators come back? Haven't we seen all there is to see? It even put new insight into the story of John Conner. I honestly didn't care what he was up to since the second movie, but now I did. Most importantly, it doesn't dwell on what the first two flicks did, which was 'Terminator chases heroes, heroes run away'. It propelled the story forward. The action was top notch and had one kick ass chase scene (every summer movie does nowadays, so it's a task to produce an exciting one). My favorite part was the T-X. The new Terminator in town, played by the beautiful Kristanna Loken, who's powers are far more advanced then previous Terminators. She played a big part in me enjoying the movie. While I'd like to highlight why, that would be spoiling it. Nick Stahl does a very convincing job at taking over the role of John Conner that was vacated by Ed Furlong. And the new addition to the pack, Kate Brewster (Clarie Danes) holds her own to make her character likeable and interesting. To be frank, I didn't think she'd have anything to bring to the table, but she proved me wrong. Overall, I was very pleased with all involved for making a worthwhile sequel, 12 years after the last movie was released! Keeping audiences interested, with such a gap in the story was a daunting task. But they delivered in spades. Even James Cameron was pleased with the result (and he hated Alien 3, he made Alien 2). So he isn't just saying that. The movie leaves open for a Terminator 4. As long as they continue to move forward with the story and not just repeat past gimmicks, I'm sure it will be good. To conclude, I love this film, and like it better than the first but not the second. I hope to see more of Kristanna in other movies...if you know what I meanRATING: *** out of ****",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
373,perlner,too short,8,3 July 2003,"This movie was quite satisfactory as an addition to the other two Terminator stories. The action sequences were exactly what one might expect, and the characterization was similarly as desired. Arnold especially shines in somewhat of an unintended comedic light.But I couldn't help feeling like this movie was just a very expensive campaign ad in which time was being paid for by the minute in order to remind the people of California who Arnold is.This movie runs just over an hour and a half and I felt that it was missing something. All the essential plot elements were there, but there was no detail. There were no sub-plots or interesting secondary characters, and the resolution was unnecessarily quick.On the other hand, there was nothing superfluous in this movie. Every scene drove the action forward and provided entertainment in many forms. I just wish that, with the $200 million budget, they could have drawn it out a bit. Hopefully there will be another sequel soon in order to fulfill the missing element.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
374,OllieZ,Has a lot to live up to...,6,3 August 2003,"Right I'll say it now - the best was the first, the second best was Judgement day and this new installment finishes in last place.  It lacks the dramatic impact,  the cool, sophisticated direction or the ""feel"" of the last two movies.  This doesn't however make this film bad, as it was rather entertaining, a lot better than The Matrix Reloaded, or any other films this year(except Whale Rider and Pirates of the ...).          The action is pretty relentless, and well done, with great camera work, some pretty violent scenes (for a 12A) and great set pieces - the toilet scene between Arnie and Loken is great, perfect action scene - much better than the overblown rubbish seen in Matrix Reloaded.  All of the action is tied together with great special effects, which, while not as stunning as T2 in its day, is great work.  Highlights are Arnies face being smashed in, and Loken's character having all her metal come off.           Acting is good, especially from Nick Stahl, who did well to carry on the role of Furlongs John Conner.  He plays it with great style and makes us feel that this character has a burden to carry.  Claire Danes is okay as Conners girl, yet she lacks depth, and just seems to be shouting and screaming.  Oh well.  Arnie is really good, he plays the terminator role with ease, yet some scenes he seems to playing a parody of his formr roles as the machine.  Also he isn't quite as well equipped in the one liners department, and seems to just get stuff from the prequels.  Still overall, he is good, and really doesn't look his age!  Lastly, Loken plays the bad guy in this movie, and although she is the worst ""baddie"" the series has seen (I'll say Arnies first role was the most menacing, T2 had the most cool), she still had lots of impressive tricks up her sleeve.  Or cleveage. Her acting was good, menacing and brooding, just like a killing machine should be like. So far so good, good action scenes, consistent acting - whats missing?  Other than James Cameron, whose flair is obviously lacking, it's the music.  The great theme tune from the prequels is gone, which left me cold in some scenes, and the action scenes lacked some oomph because of this.  The music, if included, would have made this movie a little better - more tense. Overall, a good action flick, not as good as the first two masterpieces, but a worthy addition to the series nonetheless.  It seems to have been catered for the spoilt brats of the cinema going audience, as it's only a 12A, yet it still had some gruesome moments, and overall is very entertaining.
8 out of 10PS Much better than Reloaded!",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
375,IMSandman,Great 3rd Movie!!! Go see it!!!,10,2 July 2003,"I just got back from seeing T3 and it was all it was hyped up to be and then some.   The action sequences in this movie are outstanding.  It is great to see a movie that relies more on stunts (whenever possible) than special effects for a change.  The movie takes place from where the last movie left off and stays in context with the storyline from the previous movies.  T3 also provides more ""comic relief"" than the previous two.  While some of the jokes were very cheesy, they were well placed and provided some humor to the film, similar to something out of the Indiana Jones' series. 
The female terminator was a good villain (and hot).   The action sequence where Arnold gets ripped through a building on a crane is one of the best ""chase"" scenes in recent memory.  A bit of trivia is that the movie was overbudget and Arnold paid $1.4 million out of his own pocket to have the scene shot.  Finally, the best part of the movie, and the reason why I am giving this movie such a high score, is the ending.   The ending is brilliant and I would encourage you to see the movie as quickly as possible before someone ruins the ending for you.  Placing this movie in the action genre, I would have to give it 10 stars since this movie certainly fits in the categorial rating of ""excellent."" The action is exciting and original, the plot is solid and the ending is outstanding.   Alliteration:  Another Amazing Arnold Action Adventure.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
376,CMUltra,Whew! That was a relief.,8,5 July 2003,"I was apprehensive going in. Terminator is one of my favorite franchises and sequels always run the risk of turning out *really* bad.  Added to the general ""sequel worry"" was the fact that Cameron was no longer at the helm. I had no idea who Jonathan Mostow nor Kristanna Loken were.  Both blew me away.If you like action movies, SEE THIS!  There is a chase scene early on that alone makes the movie worth the price of admission.  And the action rarely lets up.With Mostow driving, this Terminator is different from T1 and T2.  It is assumed that we know the story line by now so most of the time is given to action and, surprisingly, a good amount of humor.  Most of the humor is in-jokes reflecting events in the first two.Loken was great!  It's so easy to go wrong with a character like the T-X, but she carried it off great.  Facial expressions and body language were both excellent.Stahl was fine in the role of John Connor.  It wasn't a strength of the movie but the portrayal really didn't hurt it either.Danes was a weak point for me.  The Brewster character looked a bit old to have been a junior high make-out partner with Connor.  Brewster also seemed confused as to what type of character she was.  One moment she grabs guns and mows down opponents, the next she runs about screaming.The requisite ""die you bitch!"" line near the end is getting old too.  Sgt. Ripley saying it in Aliens was cool and on target.  Thereafter it's just a poor rehash.Arnold was, of course, Arnold.  This is a role made for him and he carried it with the same style as in the first two.  Better really, now that his character has been infused with some humor.  Arnold *is* this franchise. Make no mistake, even with the humor, these are terminators.  They are deadly, and prove it.Overall, fantastic!  I went in prepared for the series to go down a notch but hoping it was at least entertaining.  It turned out to be better than T1 and only slightly inferior to the legendary T2.7.5 of 10.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
377,grumpyass,T3 - an awesome sequel,10,16 July 2003,"I have seen this movie 3 times.  It helps that I work at a movie theater. Anyways...I just love this movie.  I would say just a little better than Judgement Day.  It was great especially with the special effects.  I am not fond of the original terminator though, don't ask me why but I am not.  But T3 is a must see, even if it's one of the only movies you see, and let e tell you the T-X (Kristanna Loken)  is hot!!!! She does very good especially with her expressions though she doesn't have a lot.  I can't wait for the sequels there's going to be at least 2 more.  But definately see this movie, see it for the awesome effect and they coolest action sequences I have seen in a while.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
378,bronty,"Passionless, cookie-cutter, derivative & dull",1,12 June 2004,"First and foremost, if they couldn't get James Cameron on board to helm a second sequel to ""The Terminator"", they just shouldn't have bothered, but this is Hollywood and so they pressed on, engaging the services of one Jonathan Morrow, a director you've never heard of before and aren't likely to hear of again anytime soon: simply put, this is ONE LOUSY DIRECTOR! True, no one is ever going to accuse the first two films of being part of the greatest movies ever made, and while I enjoyed the first (it was what it was: fun and creepy, even) and hated the second (too full of itself, too full of its own supposed ""importance"", it's James ""King of the World"" Cameron's overbloated message movie saying 'war is wrong!'. This just in), one can say at the very least they both had a passion, that whatever their faults the director, his stars, the screenwriter, etc., BELIEVED IN IT. Not this time, baby: from the word 'go', there isn't an original thought or idea on display, either behind or in front of the cameras, and it even goes so far as to rip its own franchise off, and not too well, either. James Cameron supposedly didn't want to do this film because he felt, correctly, that ""T2"" completed the story, and so THIS film becomes one predictable rehash of everything you've seen before, and NOT just in ""The Terminator"" movies: if you've seen even just a handful of action flicks, especially in the last few years, you'll be hard-pressed not to accurately guess what happens in each scene, or each shot, right down to the FX, which, after ""T2"", are also derivative and seem...been-there-done-that. One could hope that its stars might make up for the director's deficiencies but that's a lost cause, too: Nick Stahl, a not-untalented young actor, assumes the role of John Connor from Edward Furlong but doesn't have Furlong's sense of star-crossed vulnerability - he merely comes off cocky, and aware at every moment he's taken over a role ill-suited to him; as for the always-angst-ridden Claire Danes (seriously in danger of becoming this era's Jennifer Jason Leigh if she doesn't make a film in which she's happy, laughs, smiles, breaks wind, whatever!), she has the thankless task of replacing Linda Hamilton (this is driven home in one unintentionally funny moment when, in all seriousness, not long after Danes learns she and Stahl will be man and wife in the future and she's grabbed a gun and mowed down a machine-on-the-loose, Stahl says, ""You remind of my mother"", which gives proof that this film is not only written by a man but by a man who doesn't understand the first thing about women. I dare ANY man to say those words - ""You remind me of my mother"" - to a woman he likes or loves, then sit back and ruminate the possibility of a long, LONG, lonely existence.) Unfortunately, Danes has about 2 expressions: despair and disbelief. Both of these are understandable reactions to learning there are actual robotic lifeforms running amok in L.A. (as opposed to those making films like this), but her performance is wearing. HOWEVER, at least she GIVES a performance, unlike the Barbie doll chosen to be the Big Bad Terminator: for his role in ""T2"", Robert Patrick says he perfected his creepy, shark-like stare by studying birds of prey, and he was entirely successful in instilling fear; the young actress here (OK, so I forget her name - it isn't all that important since I seriously doubt you'll be hearing much about her) resembles nothing more than the over-blonde love child of Christina Ricci and Jamie Pressly, all work-the-runway supermodel swagger and pout, and ZERO menace; her attempts at trying to be ""fearsome"" - which consists of nothing more than lowering her chin and trying to stare through her tweezed eyebrows with her perfectly made-up eyes (apparently, in this terrible future, cyborgs - in addition to being the perfect killing machine - are also learned disciples of Estee Lauder) - are, at best, ridiculous, and often faintly hilarious. As for Arnold, well, all the concealer and pancake make-up in the world cannot hide what the camera makes GLARINGLY OBVIOUS: he's a little long-in-the-tooth for this kind of thing. At times, he practically seems to have been dipped in formaldehyde: you'll notice AT NO TIME is ANY strong light upon his face in ANYTHING but distant shots (where it may not be him, anyway), and all close-ups seem oddly darkened (Elizabeth Taylor used that trick, too: a black stocking over the lens to smooth out any tell-tale lines.) His appearance also smacks of desperation, reaching back to a role that he thought might put him back on top, after a grueling period where seemingly every film he'd made disappeared nearly without a trace. Actually, that, more than anything else, is what is wrong with this movie: the stink of desperation. Come to think of it, that ISN'T the worst thing; no...worse yet is that all concerned have succeeded in making an action film that's not just lifeless, it's dead-on-arrival.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
379,zofos,Beauty & The Beast,6,13 July 2009,"After Arnold Schwarzenegger destroyed the liquid metal T-1000 at the end of ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day,"" the world breathed a collective sigh of relief. Then the monster box-office takings came in and it was decided that SkyNet was far from finished. In ""Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,"" those crafty old machines try a different tack. Brawn had its chance to kill Sarah and John Connor and blew it. This time SkyNet send back a villainous creation that will use feminine wiles; the T-X or Terminatrix.The T-X is embodied in the luscious form of Kristanna Loken. Some people had problems with her performance, but she does okay and she's very easy on the eye. Her abilities are good too, she squeals like a fax machine to hack in to the L.A. school computer and track down John Connor and his future lieutenants, she can inflate her chest at will to get out of a traffic fine (and what woman wouldn't love THAT?) and she can go toe-to-toe with Arnold in a scrap (she even emasculates his power by grabbing his testicles which is Arnold's cue to deliver a puzzled expression before she hurls him through the air). She also has an arm that can turn into a laser gun/flamethrower.Her nemesis is also sent back through time and it is our old friend/enemy Arnold Schwarzenegger as a seriously outclassed T-800. Arnie was 56 when he made this film and he had undergone heart valve replacement surgery, so his excellent physical conditioning is remarkable.Arnold, as in the other Terminator movies, arrives back in our time naked. So he heads to the nearest venue to acquire clothes: a strip club. However, this sequence goes too far into comedy, having Arnold demand the clothes of an effeminate male stripper and having him wear silly sunglasses for cheap laughs (his ""talk to the hand"" catchphrase is sooo late-90s and was already out of date by 2003). Also the forced appearance of Doctor Silberman after the graveyard shootout is a laboured joke and a sop to the fans that doesn't really work.Nick Stahl plays John Connor and he goes through the whole movie looking like he's about to wet his pants. He didn't have the range as an actor to do justice to the role of John Connor (and he was totally unconvincing as an old John Connor in the future war sequence!) What a pity Edward Furlong blew the gig with his drug problems. He was perfect casting for Connor and had a good rapport with Schwarzenegger on screen. Linda Hamilton is sorely missed too.The special effects look slightly ropey because James Cameron isn't calling the shots and pushing for perfection on this one. He would never have accepted the shots of the Hunter-Killers in the future war sequence, they look like something out of a video game. The script also suffers because Cameron isn't involved. The Terminator came to him in a nightmare, so it is his vision he was following completely. He knew exactly how the Terminator universe should look and he really cared about the characters. Other directors in the Terminator series are really just hacks for hire, using the franchise to get a leg up they don't deserve.There are good things about T3; the crane chase, the Terminator tricking John Connor and Kate Brewster into saving themselves and the apocalyptic ending as seen from space which is awesome and unexpected. The protagonists in the other Terminator movies always managed to avert Judgment Day and it was a shock for audiences to see the heroes fail and for the world to be destroyed.The Terminator is such a good story that it would be hard to screw it up. Even Terminator Salvation had flashes of brilliance (only flashes mind!). ""Terminator 3"" looks better now than it did when it came out. Many prefer it to ""Terminator Salvation"" as it has things that movie doesn't; a real Arnold, time travel and street battles in a present-day setting. Essentially, it is the end of a trilogy that James Cameron started back in 1984 (Salvation would abandon the structure, main setting and noir look of Cameron's movies). It was also the beginning of the end of Arnold Schwarzenegger's acting career before he became Governor of California.The action sequences are the best thing about T3. Even though the special effects look a bit ropey and there is hardly any future war in this one, it's still a fast-paced, watchable movie.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

381,beaconb,Surprisingly humorous!,9,20 January 2019,"I watched this again after not seeing it in several years, and I haven't laughed so much in a long time! I think the jokes that are strewn throughout the movie are missed when you first watch it, and maybe even a second time. I'm not sure why the average rating of this was so low. I thought the plot was ""believable"", the acting good (with Arnold being Arnold, of course), and of course, the action and special effects were fantastic. Many of the jokes require familiarity with T2, so perhaps that is why people may have rated it lower, because without the humor, I would drop my 9 to a 7 or 8. I would recommend watching T2 again, and then watching T3, and see if your opinion of T3 goes up.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

This film as the usual car/truck chases, explosions, cross fire, Protector/Good Terminator VS Bad Terminator(aka)T-X, a little bit of new excellent effects, the usual excellent terminator make-up, as well as a few classical references to the original movies. The movie also has some classic lines such as ""I'll be Back"" or in this case ""She'll be back."" It also gives the viewers a little bit more background of what the Future in the Terminator universe is like (told by Schwarzenegger (aka) Terminator 101), as well as what to look forward for Future films such as Terminator Salvation by explain to John and his future wife Kate what happens in the future, and how the resistance was able to send back the model 101 in the first place.And finally, this movie gives the viewer the opportunity to see what John Conner would be like as a young adult without his mother around to protect him. What is really cool about this movie is that you get to see a new Terminator who is not only stronger, more powerful, and faster, but is also a female. Not to mention of course the whole Female terminator idea is hot. No, it is not the best Terminator film yet to date, no it is not as good as it's previous two films before it, but it is a good film never the less.

383,kingtanichi,"Ingenious ending, but overall disappointing",7,11 February 2004,"WARNING: ENDING SPOILERS!!!If ever there was a project doomed from the very start, it had to be T3. The making of a terminator film without either James Cameron or Linda Hamilton was a recipe for disaster, and even mighty Arnold isn't what he once was. On top of that, the new director is Jonathan Mostow, a man whose only credits thus far have both been mediocre action flicks. And we end up with...A mediocre action flick. Well, that's better than I'd expected.Actually, this whole movie plays like a big piece of self-parody. It is undisputed fact the heyday of Schwarzenegger-style action is over, yet they still keep trying here. Nick Stahl, who has inexplicably been cast in the role of John Connor despite being the least heroic, least imposing, and least edgy actor working today, is a waste of space, and the moment at the beginning that shows him made up to look like his future self is the purest agony. Please Mostow! Cameron picked Edward Furlong and Michael Richards, BOTH of whom were perfect! Is this really the best you can do?When compared to Robert Patrick's cold menace as the T-1000, Kristanna Loken is a waste of space as the T-X. She generates any menace only in the single shot used ubiquitously in the trailers, so it's one long letdown in the theatre. The new terminator's abilities are incredibly badly explained, and they also look stupid. And Claire Danes. I have nothing against Claire Danes. I like Clair Danes. She was great as Juliet, I loved her in The Hours, and she did a great voice for San in Princess Mononoke. But she is not Sarah Connor, nor will she ever be any substitute Sarah Connor awkwardly shoehorned as John's future wife to cover the fact that Linda Hamilton was smart enough to skip this project.The action, as stated earlier, is mediocre at best. Cameron's gift for pushing the envelope is sorely missed. A fetish for big trucks, so subtly worked into the first two, sticks out Arnold's ridiculous new ""nuclear cell"" here. Mostow tries, and fails, to spice things up with some pointless gore and exposition, but neither works.Now, finally, the good news. When we get to the titular event, which comprises the last act, things improve considerably. With a host of early-model HKs to play with, for the first time, we actually get some action scenes that not only get the adrenaline pumping, but do so an almost Cameron scale. We also see some actual Terminator-style production design for the first time in the film.And then, there's the ending. Total nuclear annihilation. That's a courageous enough act of narrative to make me forgive a lot, and plus, its handling is sublime. Though that's largely because it's done in narration and we don't have to see Nick Stahl.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
384,ClarusTheDogCow,Lame,6,12 July 2003,"Terminator 3 was a disappointing movie.  I expected more but left feeling unsatisfied.A few things:1) Apparently high-ability, super-intelligent machines growl and meow when they are upset.  2) Apparently physics does not exist in the future... The Toyota truck would have not been able to move after a rear collision with another car.  The collision were very CG animated... Too CG animated... Just flat out unbelievable.3) I enjoyed the stock footage of when the Terminators' battery pack ""became unstable"". I thought that was hilarious that the director used old stock footage from mine explosions (the second battery pack - at the Crystal place).4) What was with the gay dancer? Stupid subplot.  Obviously the director wanted to add humor from past Terminator movies for nostalgic reasons but failed.  In fact, the humor behind the whole movie was banal.5) It is obvious that Arnold is older than 50.  Geriatrics is fun!6/10.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
385,Rovin,A well made big budget B movie that could have been much worse.,7,9 July 2003,"If Cameron can do a sequel to Alien then why can't someone do a sequel to his baby?  Overall it was a well made big budget B movie with a few surprises and more skill than I would have expected. The action sequences were quite good--especially the first chase. No, the T X was not as memorable as the T-1000--but give her credit for trying. She really could take abuse while holding the same expression. 
 Granted, I did miss Cameron's epic blue steel ""look"" and Brad Fiedel's music. The first Terminator was a decent low budget eighties thriller(the only flaw for me was that they cooked up the ludicrous notion that only organic tissue could time travel--which neither T2 or T3 held to). On the other hand, T2 was never what it could have been. It had the advantage of introducing computer graphics in a big action film--but its heavy handed social commentary (the children playing with guns sequence, the closing narration etc.) and often goofy out of character dialogue(""I need a vacation"") made my eyes roll . Cameron decided to make a nicer, friendlier terminator who discovers human emotions. Noble effort but I do not think he pulled it off. He also wanted us to believe that some good ol boy computer specialist is going to throw away his career and civilian life just because a kid, a crazy militia woman, and some guy with a mechanical arm shows up. And I cannot forgive him for missing the most obvious closing action sequence by not having a stripped down stop motion animated endoskeleton duking it out with the computer generated  liquid metal shapeshifter in the steel mill. That would have been a spectacular sequence and probably made the final terminator-father moments less hokey than they appeared.
Anyway--back to T3SPOILER WARNING
Arnold's Terminator: I thought he was less jokey than in T-2, and closer to a machine. And its fair to say that this Terminator actually succeeded (or will succeed) in completing its mission(ironically, including those of the first Terminator and the T-1000). As in T2--there were times when he came across as too human in his responses (though the first sequel did establish he was reprogrammed to adapt).  Also the conflicted cyborg/car smashing sequence was too much.Story-wise, the screenwriters evidently tried to put something into the story. The ending was brave--especially given the current international climate and new nuke technologies being discussed.
Overall it could have been much worse given hollywood's record of late, though another sequel would really be stretching it.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

The first film is one of my all-time favourites and the second was a near-perfect sequel  so I approached this film with a bit of trepidation. Yes, it's true. Terminator 3 isn't as good as either of the first two. The story has some weaknesses and some of the acting (mainly Stahl and Danes) isn't that great. Nevertheless, Arnold is terrific, the action is outstanding (especially the crane scene) and the ending is certainly memorable. I'm glad I took the time to watch it.

389,j_graves68,how do you re-invent the wheel?,5,11 April 2005,"When I heard that James Cameron wasn't helming this third installment, I didn't expect it to be very good. And I was right. How do you re-invent the wheel with the shock waves he brought us with Terminator 2? (Still one of my favorites). At the end of T2, there was an element of hope that was instilled by the actions of the Terminator, John, and Sarah Connor and the destruction of CyberDyne. Well, fast-forward to this movie, and the writers simply tell us that ""judgement day is inevitable"". Okay, then I guess that means we should have another sequel to milk this franchise for everything it has. I wouldn't be surprised if this turned up as a Saturday morning cartoon, too. So back to the important point that the writers probably thought the audience wouldn't realize about the future: time is always in transit in motion- and the future is compiled by what happens in the present. There is no set unprecedented event that will happen regardless.Another flaw that was never explained (not much really was in this film and instead left to clever one-liners, ""talk to the hand""), was how did the government all of the sudden after the demise of CyberDyne conjure up all of this spectacular and much more sophisticated technology on such short notice? And why did the Terminator have to go into another bar as soon as he arrived, get the same kind of clothes, and the director even threw in a comic relief gag when leaving...Hmm, I keep thinking of the second one...John Conner was a whiny wimp, and I never believed for a second that this was the future leader of the free world. Claire Danes had more balls than him. I'm not saying Nick Stahl wasn't a good choice (I saw him in ""Bully""& he was a bastard), but if the writer(s) gave him a front-row seat (like they did with Edward Furlong)instead of playing the helpless b$#ch, I think it would've helped in becoming a better film. Claire Danes was on her way to becoming the next Sarah Conner, and the TX wasn't very threatening. No special powers to speak about aside from controlling machines. Did I see that once on the Sci-Fi channel? Once again, it was the work of the writers/producers condescending to the audience thinking sex appeal would sell more tickets. I think it did. The film had a look to it as if it were an early-eighties, made-for-TV flick, whereas T2 had blues, metallic greys, and shadows. This didn't feel like a Terminator movie.I really hope they don't make a Terminator 4 and chip away some more @ Cameron's reputation and our intelligence.A day or so after I saw this, I was talking to someone about it, expecting them to tell me how they were disappointed they were in the flick, but they said the opposite! Guess they don't get out much!And I guess she's the kind of person filmmakers of this dreck want in their test audiences.

390,bigben5,Good when it could have been great... (Spoilers),8,13 July 2003,"*SPOILERS*
Unfortunately, I never did see both full length movies of T1 and T2, however I did see the ending when I tuned into the TV. I personally enjoyed this movie very much. It even made sense to the viewer who hadn't seen the original two made by James Cameron. The special effects were awesome as was the car chase scene. I also give kudos to the writers for making the TX feel more like a cold, cut throat mechanical object, than just a piece of eye candy and of course she had lots of fight in her. There was also plenty of comedy relief thoughout and it was good to see the film poking fun at itself and at the Terminator franchise.So, where does the film fall apart?. In my opinion, it fell at the ending. It all went down hill when Arnold aka T-850 fails to kill John Connor and just shuts down. That seemed a bit too easy for me, when it had potential to be a lot more. Also, when he boots back up he is back to normal without TX's malicious programing controlling his mind. Again too easy.There was also the final confrontation, where they try to escape to the air base. The TX just gets crushed by the helicopter and comes back out without her liquid metal on. What happened to that?. I guess, I'm not too much into saving the world type stuff and about big bombs about to go off. Maybe its because Hollywood endings always have people defuse the bomb at the last second or because I can't see it as happening when I'm sitting omfortably in my chair. The death scene between Arnold and the TX was good but in my opinion typical. And at the end John and that other girl are in the base. Safe from all the nuclear missles going on.It was great on one hand, because the Terminator was smart enough to change course and accomplish his mission when John threatened to kill himself, and yet it just feels so hollow, I mean you knew he was never meant to die and so what, he lives. Sure there's meaning to the ending, but it just ends so abruptly and is so pointless ,only setting itself up for another movie.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
391,Progressive-Element,"A roller-coaster ride, but a lesser movie",7,25 May 2013,"Terminator 2 had such a perfect ending, but given how successful it was a the box-office it was inevitable another sequel would be churned out. While predictably, this one, directed by Jonathan Mostow, would never be in the same league as the first two, it's still a better film that perhaps was expected.This one goes for balls-to-the-wall action, and on that level it certainly delivers. A visual spectacular, with the highlight being a destructive vehicle chase with the T-X driving a crane. The special effects are cool, though at times a tad too obvious. For about 2 hours, the film does not let up.It becomes clear though, that action and special effects are about all we're going to get. That and silly one-liners. Arnie makes a welcome return - of sorts, though he's undermined whenever scenes are played for laughs. Kristanna Loken is creepily lithe as the T-X, and is perhaps the best reason to watch it. Though little more than a variation of the T-1000, she still makes for a worthy addition to the cyborg killers Skynet keeps churning out. Nick Stahl and Claire Danes however aren't really that likable as John Connor and Katy Brewster. What this film lacks is the presence of someone like Kyle Reese in the first, and the buffed up Sarah Connor of the second. Indeed it's lacking the heart and soul of the first two preferring to toss that aside in favour of non-stop thrills.While still very entertaining for most of it's way, at the climax, it starts to fall apart somewhat, and the final face-off between Arnie and the T-X is pretty weak. The ending however is quite a brave move, a brief attempt to recapture some of the bleak tone of the first.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

The introduction of a 'female' terminator adds a unique dynamic to the series which is surprisingly very interesting.

393,bill_b4,Definitely A Must See,9,6 July 2003,"SPOILERS: Saw the movie and have to say that it was a very pleasant surprise. Not only was it faithful to the concept of the first two movies, but like T2, builds on its foundation and brings new ideas. I particularly liked the concept of fate...John Conner, knowing his fate, yet denying it; the inevitable takeover by Skynet, etc. It also managed to bring in new and exciting action and special effects, as well as building onto the plot and surprising me by taking it in unexpected directions. All these factors make the movie very entertaining, and worth the price, especially for Terminator/Schwarzeneggar fans. Another tidbit that I've been pondering since seeing the movie, is the evolutionary psychology behind all 3 films. The first one came out during the cold war, in which the Soviet Union and the United States were in the middle of a Mexican standoff with a combined nuclear arsenal capable of wiping out human civilization hundreds of times over. The first movie was created within those times, and the message was one in which the human spirit can prevail, in spite of the potential armageddon, and can seek to change a probable future. The second movie, created at the end of the cold war in which detente and diplomacy had achieved a bloodless end to the potential nuclear confrontation that had been hanging over the world for the past two generations, had a different message: one in which man is in complete control of his destiny, and if he is willing to take the risks and make the sacrifices, anything is possible. Now we come to the 3rd movie, and the current world is much different. No longer do we face a potential standoff between nuclear states, but the specter of international terrorists, and the possibility of a nuclear, chemical or biological attack by these ruthless groups, especially in a post 9-11 world, I think has brought back the fear of armageddon again, albeit from a different direction, and I believe this last installment of the Terminator series, reflects that fear. We fear something catastrophic is around the corner, something terrible and unavoidable feels bound to happen, and it is now just a matter of time, so prepare for it. The enemy is not within a single mainframe at one specific location, it is all around us, and unable to be removed. I believe that is the underlying pervasive psychology behind this movie, and as an honest reflection of the times, brings another element of pleasant surprise, and another reason to not miss this movie.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
394,Grimsonia,This was an awful ending to an amazing series,1,8 October 2007,"Terminator, the original was a great movie. It was dark and atmospheric. The acting was excellent. I felt Michael Biehn(sp) and Linda Hamilton's characters had chemistry together, the story was good and the action was amazing.Terminator 2 however, blew me away! How the characters had grown! The future still dark... The action sequences were even better! I waited, and waited so hopefully for the sequel... then finally I saw it, and it had nothing in common with the first two serious films other than the vague following of the plot. The whole film was a joke, and if it had been marketed as a farce or comedy I may have liked it, but it was presented as a serious sequel somehow! The female terminator was hilarious, not menacing... the original terminator looked ready for a rest home, The guy who took over Furlongs part was also very amusing with the dumbo ears and white hair when they show him in the future and the girl was a waste of film altogether... she screamed well, I guess...I'd have to give her that...It was noted on Linda Hamilton's website that she refused a small part they offered her in the beginning because she said the film had no heart or soul or something like that, and she was right. The first two did and are classics, the third, well, it should never have been made, but the greed and the lack of talent are great in this world...",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
395,epatters-3,Terminator 3:Rise of the Crap.,3,25 May 2008,"Crap. Just crap. Terrible dialogue. The first 2 were great but this is just a big piece of crap that is only fit for idiots that are fans of Battlefield Earth and people that think that every sequel is better then the previous installment. The Termanatrix sucks. The T-1000 is a better Terminator then that one. The TX is played by a frigging female. Terrible performances except for Arnold's. But that does not stop it from being the worst in the trilogy. Sarah Conner is dead. I think that Jonathon Mostow should be ashamed of himself for ruining(for give me) the series. If you have only seen the first 2 and you think you have seen it all then your right. You have. This one is so skipabble that I think that the movie thinks that the extreme dumbness of the movie is amusing. If you have not seen any of the Terminator movies then watch Part 1 and Part 2. Skip Part 3. I do not recommend you on buying this film. I do not recommend you renting this film. I do not recommend you on watching this film. In my opinion, the series is still 2 movies. I enjoy to pretend that this film was never made. It should have never been made. The 2nd worse time travel movie, next to Time Chasers. Avoid this piece of crap at all costs. Terminator 2 should have been the last one. Personally, I would like to send a Terminator back in time to stop this movie from being made. That is how bad this movie was. Just stay away. If you think that all sequels are better then one before, then this is for you. otherwise, just stay away. 3 out of 10 stars. Another CGI piece of bullcrap. If you have only seen the first 2 then you have seen it all. Do not watch this. I am doing you a favor. Please do not watch this. Thank you.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
396,ToddWebb,pretty damn good,9,3 July 2003,"Most important: it does NOT ruin the series!I loved it.The beginning was Terminator trite -- 1 terminator appears, the 2nd appears, he has to get clothes.  We've seen it all in the 1st 2 movies.  But after that it really took off on its own.The use of special effects was great.  There was SOME useless ""shaky cam"" shots thrown in there.  But mostly, the fight scenes and chase scenes were epic.I expected to see Arnold, the Terminator, chasing John with a walker. He's not young anymore.  But he's still got ""it.""Most important for me, I felt like the story progressed.  This isn't just another 1 of 20 sequels they'll make.  In T3, the story actually moves forward.  So if -- IF -- they do make a T4, it'll have to ""move on"" from here.  I was pleased with that.Be warned: Arnold has more than his share of silly one-liners.  This one is definately more light-hearted than the previous movies.I give it 9/10 -- maybe even 10/10.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
397,orourkec-292-269155,T-Thrilling...,7,13 November 2014,"For me, T-3: Rise of the Machines was fun to watch and after finishing it I walked away smiling. The movie is technically brilliant, the CGI makeup of the terminator on the good side is outstanding, the film has outstanding wit and the action is exhilarating. My favorite scene of the entire film is the particularly good action scene where the good terminator is fighting against the nasty T-X near the end of the film in the toilet room and that scene was punchy entertainment. And how nice that a woman leading character is given a chance in this movie to prove to us that women in movies are capable of a few things and don't always need to rely on men leading characters for help. Youhou, go for girls' equal rights oh yeah. However I think that her character and character's role in the story would have been better and bigger if we saw her do more brave and/or responsible thing(s) rather than just one act of bravery and responsibility. Another flaw that T-3: Rise of the Machines has unfortunately fallen prey to is that it lacks the ruthless, scary and sharp feel of the dark future for which the good characters are fighting to prevent, from the previous two films. And I also need to mention the script which is soulless as a piece of storytelling and obvious and doesn't give away anything special like in the previous two films and that can also include the characters and emotion(s). Not only that but the dialogue in the film is simplistic and there aren't enough dialogue lines between the two main characters of the movie: John Connor and Kate Brewster. Still, despite T-3: Rise of the Machines not being a perfect movie it is a worthy addition to the Terminator franchise, there is no doubt about it. Thank you very much Mr. Jonathan Mostow for delivering us exactly the type of thrills we want. Everyone, rise your champaign and give toast to... T-3: Rise of the Machines. My rating for this movie: 7.2/10",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

Why did you set the tone for another movie?! This could've been an amazing conclusion to it all! The movie was sooo good until the end. What a mistake. This movie had action, suspense, and curiousity. Why did you end the movie like that?! The ending could have been sooo much better. I'm disappointed. Up until the ending you made me not want to leave the theater. I hate when perfect movies end badly. It could have been better. I wish it was.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
399,eflemieux,It sure delivers the goods,9,2 July 2003,"Was I scared of this sequel!!!Although i really liked Terminator 2, there were some aspects of the casting that greatly annoyed me. I found Edward Furlong and Linda Hamilton totally miscast for their roles. No such problem with T3. The casting is perfect. The story line is intelligent and goes way beyond what could be expected from a sequel. The Terminatrix is truly steel cold and Arnold holds his own, with a slight touch of ""cabotinage"" (which could be roughly translated from french as ""hot-dogging""). The actors deliver... Nick Stahl and Claire Danes are totally credible in their roles (while, i must say it again, Furlong and Hamilton were not).The effects are so seamless that we cannot see any CGI or mechanical effects, which is the mark of a great effort and success.Jonathan Mostow does deliver similar results than J. Cameron. In a way, he doesn't have a signature style while Cameron has one that can sometimes be distracting. In short, very honest work - a lot of bang for the buck. No oscar material but this is entertainment - and it sure is entertaining. It kills me that some people went into the next door theater to see ""28 days after"" (the king of the stinkers) instead of T3.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
400,pulikd,Terminator 3. The First Take,7,10 December 2020,"Sarah Connor and her son John survived the second movie in a hopeful ending. But since the whole time travel idea in this franchise is a time loop where the present and the future are indivisible and responsible for one another, Judgement Day is, indeed, inevitable.In this movie, John Connor is a homeless person, existing off the grid and haunted by nightmares. The promised disaster that was supposed to happen in 1997 did not happen, and now is 2004. His mother died of cancer in between T2 and T3. Of course, that is not the way a heroine like Sarah Connor should end her part. But they could not get the actress for the part they had planned and so, we have what we have. Doctors said she only had 6 months left in her. But she fought the disease for three years. As if she had wanted to reach that infamous 1997 and be at peace, to be sure there is no Judgement Day. Not a disrespectful way to handle her off screen passing, at least. And as for John, his way of life here is logical. With what we saw in the second film, John was doomed to have trouble with authorities and, in general, the law. Not too much is skipped in between T2 and T3.2 time travelers are here again. The killer, the most advanced yet, is masked as a beautiful woman. But the mission is more difficult this time. She has several targets, not one. In fact, she has a whole target list of people who are important for humanity. They will, apparently, play their part alongside the primary target, John Connor. But her mission does not end there. She is also tasked with triggering Judgement Day itself with her super advanced abilities. She can appear as anyone else and cannot be stopped by casual weapons. Also, she can control other machines. Like latest battle drones that aren't even made public yet. The other time traveler is, obviously, the protector. He has 2 humans to take care of. Not just to save them from her, but to make sure they survive the worldwide nuclear disaster. The weak part here is detail and screen time. With so many elements, T3 should be a longer movie than it is. With more attention paid to other termination targets.One of those targets is John's future wife. The weak part here is what happened in between T2 and T3. By the logic of what we have here, John knew her even before the events of T2. But none of it had ever been mentioned before. Like Kate Brewster had never been in any original plans for these movies and had to be invented just now. Not a big problem, though. Especially, considering how she is presented and handled in the movie. On the contrary, she helps to add realism and solidify the whole thing. Here is why.From the second film one can safely conclude that John Connor is the future savior because of how he was raised and what skills and knowledge he got. The third movie adds one more element to this picture. He once made friends with a girl whose father is one of the highest ranking military of The US. Now, in the third movie, John and Kate are reunited. An unstoppable killing machine wants them dead and they have no choice but to be together with their time traveling protector. They do not have a big history together. But he is the first guy she ever kissed. And he remembers her because that kiss happened on the day he first met Uncle Bob, the previous Arnold shaped future sent protector. One that John looked at as a father figure.John and Kate do not want each other now. In fact, Kate was going to get married. That is no longer happening. And the now homeless John does not look attractive in any way. Her father trusts Kate and does not doubt her choices and her judgement because of how resourceful he considers her to be. And he is a busy man, so he has not even seen the guy she was going to marry. In the end, when John and Kate rush to his aid, he mistakes John for that guy. And John now has a way to not only survive the nuclear disaster but a place where military all over the country can be contacted. And he not only has his skills and his knowledge but a young woman whose name could be useful by his side. Also, they have grown to value and respect one another through the film. Kate now knows what John knows. She may not be his type, he may not be her type. But they have no choice and a huge responsibility weighing down on them heavily. Together, they will cope with it. It's survival and duty, not mere feelings.So, T1 says the future is set. There is a storm coming. You can only survive it. That's the best you can hope for. T2 says no, the disaster and the war can be avoided. James Cameron did not want to work with this franchise anymore. And he wanted to end it. So he made a movie where the ending basically prevents other movies from being possible whether or not it contradicts his own rules he set in the very first film. Other people took over and reinstituted the original rule. And if you think about what the movie has in terms of the story and the meaning, it is surprisingly good. As a kid, I loved the first two and just liked the third one. Now, an adult, I am way more interested in the third one. And I find way more pleasure in revisiting it. Because of the story that it has and how it adds to the first two movies.In that case, what's wrong with the movie? Well, the visual effects are mostly brilliant. But the movie lacks practical effects and relies more on CGI than it needs to. Some would easily label the music as weak and a disadvantage. I disagree. It is different but it fits here well. By the way, it goes for the tone of the whole picture. It does not want you to love it just because you are familiar with the franchise. It does not rely heavily on nostalgia. It is a sequel with a familiar plot. But it does not want to be a copy. Some would mention the humor. Yes, some of the jokes were not good. But that is a minor issue.The ""Bad"" Arnold did some stupid things in the first one in order for the heroes to reach the end of the movie. So did the ""bad"" Robert, only more. So does the ""bad"" Kristanna, only even more. Not a great plan.Anyway, the movie is interesting and awesome. But it does not outshine the previous one. And it has more CGI that it requires. Also, the story in here is very good. But it requires more detail and runtime. I hear, an airplane crash sequence had been planned, but the budget was too big already. I imagine, this movie should be at least two and a half hours long in order to cover all it wants perfectly.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
401,RandomTask-AP,Mechanical assassins & explosions galore... good times! (trailer-level spoilers),6,19 August 2003,"Summer movies are about reunions. The cast and creators of a successful movie come back to tell you another tales of the characters you loved so much the first time around. While ""T3""only retains one of the original cast and crew, there is still a reunion. It's a reunion between Arnold and the particular kind of fun he brings to his audience.The present for John Connor (Nick Stahl) is now more bleak than his future. The doomsday foretold in the second installment did not come to pass, but John lives piecemeal and constantly on the move in fear that the mechanical demons of his childhood future may come back to hunt him. We know that very game is what we came to see, so we can't blame the poor guy for being paranoid. The machines do arrive in the form of the T-X model (Kristanna Loken) but with John being so hard to find, the T-X has secondary targets to search out. A mechanical protector, a T101 model (Arnold Schwarzenegger), arrives to help protect John and one of his future lieutenants (Claire Danes). Then the chase is fully on because the delayed ""judgement day"" is now eminent and Arnold's T101 is so vastly outmatched by the T-X. (And also because this is a sequel.)The story is a bit thinner this time out, but few people could be expected to match ""Iron Jim"" Cameron's fiercely perfectionist filmmaking step for step. However, ""U571"" helmsman, Johnathan Mostow, is up to the task of keeping the action rolling and pulling the viewer along for the ride. He sets up everything as obstacles for the heroes, including things that are not usually found in action films, such as kennel cages, a particle accelerator and one wildly out-of-control construction crane. While the design of the T-X villain permits her almost every resource the situation demands, Claire Danes bears quite a bit of the missing exposition from John's childhood as well as the burden of frequently being a convenient plot device. However, she does it unflinchingly and helps carry the action forward.Describing the action in any greater detail would be the same as telling everyone in line for the roller coaster the exact number and direction of the turns in the rail. The effects and stunts are all there in cutting- edge glory. This `Terminator' is not as dark as the first, nor as envelope-pushing as the second, but it is a complete thrill ride, and a welcome one in a summer of multiple action failures. It's worth the trip to the theater. Just try not to think too much about it afterwards.7 out of 10",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

403,erikgloor,"Not nearly as satisfying as T2, but pretty fun",7,7 July 2003,"John Connor is shown in a flash-forward in the beginning of 'T3,' not just as triumphant, but triumphant with an American flag draped over his shoulder. An American man saves the world from the small-minded machines. And so begins the sometimes not-so-subtle love song to the American man, that 'T3' so often is. A love song sung in broken English, and with a German accent.Nothing that Hollywood puts this much energy and money ino can ever be dismissed as just an action picture.A film student could probably do a pretty decent dissertation on the differences in directing styles by comparing 'T2' and 'T3' as two films that are as similar as two films can get in terms of subject-matter, but which differ so noticeably in tone and subtext.The cold, dark blue world of T2 was full of sophisticated foreboding and it couched it's fantastic effects and spectacular violence in some interesting meditations on the concepts of Generation X and of the passage of time. Arnold was older, but still the picture of vitality and robotic perfection. There was some poetry to the picture.The present effort is not devoid of these elements, but comes precipitously close on a number of different levels.For those of us who were 16 when the original 'Terminator' came out, watching 'T2' was like watching your idiot friend get a date with his sexy first-year college professor. Someone big decided to take this slightly moronic but highly entertaining concept seriously and make a silk purse out of it and it was great. 'T3' is kind of like what it'd be like if that friend came around again after marrying the professor and tried hard to remember what it was like to be down with his boys way back when. You want it to be the same, but it just isn't. It's an exercise in sentimentality mostly.But what we don't get in terms of depth and scope, we get in terms of Arnold's personal vision of masculinity. I mean, let's face it, everybody knows the 'Terminator' movies are for boys -- the girls have 'Sex in the City.' Arnold's commentary on the state of the American male ego is subtle, but if you watch for it, it becomes very clear.Firstly, I was highly suspect of the newcomer bad-guy, or gal, in this case. From press pictures, she didn't seem scary at all -- or even mechanical in any way. I thought the angular dimensions and sheer size of someone like Brigitte Nielsen, in her heyday, would have been far more adequate a choice. But I have to say Kristanna Loken won me over early. Soft and supple, but somehow menacing in her sheer determination, I don't think it's an accident a pretty young German woman wound up opposite my favorite Austrian killer robot. And I doubt it was an accident she comes dressed in the guise of a leather-clad, Lexus-driving material girl who pumps up her breast-size to get out of trouble.Further, the scene in which Arnold and Kristanna square off in a men's room is very nearly worth the price of admission. Not simply a dance of destruction, but subtly, a contest of dominance and submission. Indeed, Arnold works his old-fashioned German values into this film probably more than any other I've seen. Arnold's robot makes value judgments this time around and says things like ""Maybe you're not the John Connor I know."" I doubt it took more than a couple of Nazi movies for Schwarzenegger to feel it was his duty to rehabilitate the sensibilities of his grandparents to the typical American if he ever got the opportunity. One must wonder how much he is appealing the current, non-threatening (think Tom Hanks) consensus of movie manhood, when his character says things like ""I am an obsolete design"" and ""she is a healthy female of breeding age."" Finally, *** SPOILER *** one can't help but read into the imagery of Arnold's robot pulling a grasping female robot off of the John Connor character and ramming his, Arnold's, heart (metaphorically) down her throat to finish her off. The young Connor escapes with his bride-to-be. This is a powerful image of male dominance that implies something of fatherhood and parental dynamics.It's easy to debate these inferences, but it's important to remember that when Hollywood whispers, everyone hears.I think old Arnold thinks the American male is a little embattled and a little down on himself and thinks we could take a lesson from our vanquished teutonic foes. Because this is the movie he'd make given that mindset.Do we need this shot in the arm? Hey, I'M not gonna argue with him. It's Arnold!This movie review by Erik Gloor",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
404,CinematicGarbage,The Movie's Spoiling the Future!!,4,11 May 2019,"The third movie of the Terminator Saga was not directed by James Cameron anymore but Jonathan Mostow. The movie also changed its studio from Metro Goldwyn Mayer into Warner Bros. Pictures.It is a lot like the second movie: Judgment Day. A terminator was sent to kill John Connor again. The last movie we had T- 1000 and then it's T-X, a completely new terminator. After dying in Judgment Day, T-800 had returned and took some punk clothes and sunglasses, just like the first two. It should change I think.Everybody loved to see a terminator movie with Arnold Schwarzenegger and he made his third debut in the third movie. However, I wasn't impressed with the plot that T-800 wasn't a series 101 but a different one, a protagonist with a dark and strict character. He forgot everything John taught him in Judgment Day: the smile, Hasta La Vista Baby and more. I was really disappointed with that fact. John Connor wasn't played by Edward Furlong anymore, the role changed to Nick Stahl, who had been known for being in Sin City (2005). The performances weren't as good as the previous two but they weren't terrible. Schwarzenegger wasn't trying his best for the third movie so I think the best performance here was Nick Stahl's John Connor. He was excellent making the character Katherine Brewster played by Claire Danes agreed to be on their side. It's great to see the two together.The really big problem here was T-800. He knew too much and he kept predicting futures. It's not necessary to or maybe he shouldn't say it. It's like spoiling a movie with great contents. T-800 said the two got married, John would be terminated in 2032 and more things that we wouldn't want to be spoiled. When T-800 revealed when John Connor dies, it was the stupidest thing to say. And it got worse when T-800 revealed the killer,...him. I called this the biggest issue in this movie. It's really terrible and I hate it! See, that's why this one's the least popular of the Terminator Saga based on IMDb (6.3/10).However, I don't hate the other parts of the movie, they were good. The CGI was okay and so was the cinematography. The action sequence were epic and instead of saying his words (Hasta La Vista, Baby) to kill T-X, T-800 said: ""You are Terminated!"". That would explain that T-800 completely forgot about what John had taught him in Judgment Day.It's not one of the bests in the Saga, but it wasn't too bad. I'm looking forward to see more: Terminator Salvation, Terminator Genisys and Dark Fate. I'm starting to like this franchise.Ratings: 6.8/10",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

The rest is fairly fragile stuff in the plot department so I won't risk any ""spoilers"" but let us agree that the story isn't much.  The action is up to current standards of exploding cars , buildings, people etc..But just once I would like someone to clue me in on the problem of how these super terminators can EVER lose. Nothing stops them so how would humans ever win even in the future?There is a hint in this movie and I am going to assume that the creators of this situation have pondered that problem and that will be visited in Terminator ""4""?I can't really see to much to change in the format.

It's a great roller coaster ride, but perhaps just a shade less so than T2.And here's something I thought I'd never be saying ... Arnie is so good. His deadpan delivery of some of his hilarious lines is  just spot on, and he even makes you feel the confusion of the man-machine faced with moral dilemmas. In fact, in a role that is really just a high tech version of Frankenstein's monster, I'd say he even gives the great Boris Karloff a run for his money.And the ending this time leaves us in absolutely no doubt that Arnie (and the others) will be back.Unless he becomes Governor of California, of course.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

408,HawkHerald,"Too Little, Too Late",3,29 December 2013,"If there was really going to be a movie showing the events leading up to Judgment Day then it should have been in theaters between 1993-1995. As it is, this abomination was scrapped together from sloppy remnants. Only a still buff but dated looking Arnold Schwarzenegger as returns the T-800 sent back to stop the T-X from murdering Kate Brewster (Claire Daines) and John Connor (Nick Stahl). The T-X (Kristanna Loken) is an endoskeleton with built-in weapons, the same ability to change appearance as the T-1000 and she can control machines. She commandeers a woman's convertible, cop car and several construction vehicles, and begins killing John Connor's future Human Resistance lieutenants. Her ultimate mission is to infect America's computer controlled nuclear arsenal with a virus that would launch the United States' nuclear weapons. John Connor has been living a nomadic, off-the-grid lifestyle since the T-2 events. His narration mentions that Judgment Day never happened and though he and his mom had destroyed Skynet in the past, he never shook the feeling that something terrible happening was inevitable. The movie starts out well but ends being filled with bad jokes, a weak story and even worse performances. Claire Daines was badly miscast and grows so annoying you end up cheering for the T-X to waste her. Nick Stahl is an underwhelming John Connor, boring but not terrible. He looks like a homeless stoner expecting to wake up from a bad trip. Schwarzenegger is playing a role he knows very well but that's not exactly a good thing since he's rehashing an old character for a fat paycheck. Kristanna Loken is a beautiful woman and that's about it, she's a non-acting performer in this. This movie was the end of The Terminator as a relevant franchise.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

Now it's time for the third one in the franchise: Rise Of The Machines. Before watching this film, I took a look at the cast, writers and the director. When I noticed the changes, I knew I'm going to see an average Arnold film. It wasn't better than my expectations, nor was it worse than that. I'm just glad it's not awful. Let's start with the positives first: The directing is pretty great, the script is also good, the dialog was good at best, the action was fantastic and the comedy was well-handled. Now the let's talk about why it's not perfect: Some characters didn't get as much screen time as they should've, the first 40 minutes (!!!) were just an unexplained action exposition, the story wasn't that great, and it was pretty hard to feel bad for their characters, even though we learn about them as the film progresses. Overall, it's a pretty awesome action film. If you're only looking for awesome action scenes and comedy, you won't be disappointed.

411,LG72387,"Good, Not Great",6,12 July 2003,"Those looking for extreme action this summer best catch a glimpse at Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines. This is a movie that features pure action and nothing more. There are massive gun fights, car chases, explosions, the whole lot. T3 is a fast-paced action thriller that grabs you and never lets go. Arnold Schwarzenegger looks great for a 55-year old man and kicks serious ass in this film. Kristanna Lohken (who plays the T-X) is a sexy villain who enjoys kicking Arnold's ass all over the place (including a bathroom stall). So for those looking for nothing but action will truly get their money's worth after seeing this movie. However, I prefer to look for more than action. I want to see just a slight bit of drama in this type of movie. T3 offers little to no drama except at the very end of the film (I will not reveal the ending because it is a surprise) Even so, you could probably see the ending coming since Arnold's character keeps hinting at it throughout the film. That is where T3 falters as a picture. The screenplay is so predictable and carries too many cliches. Also, there are too many comical lines which damage the film's credibility. As a result, what you see on the screen is a full-scaled action picture littered with explosive stunts and amazing special effects. T3 does not have the James Cameron touch that was present in the first two films which weakens it as well. T2 was much better because it was able to incorporate more emotion between John Connor and the Terminator all while presenting you with explosive stunts and special effects. Frankly, I missed Edward Furlong playing John Connor. He gave an incredible performance in T2 and Nick Stahl's portrayal is weak with no emotion whatsoever. It feels like he's trying his best not to act but to just get through his lines, which he can't do because of the weak screenplay. Claire Danes's character of Kate Brewster shows some emotion but not enough to make you feel for your loss. The only time you feel eligible to shed a tear is at the very end of the film.
Yet I believe that T3's pure action method saves it from becoming a failure of a movie which I why I praise it. It is a film solely for the people who want action and only action. It is also for the people who want to see Arnold kick a woman's ass and the woman kicking his ass as well. Although there is no drama, T3 is able to successfully continue the action half of the Terminator franchise which makes it a good film but not great.

412,mkm-hermanjnr,The kiss of death that started the franchise's demise,4,11 November 2019,"Terminator 1 was a great sci-fi horror flick with some action thrown in. The T-800 was a menacing, unstoppable blunt force killer and Schwarzenegger was perfect for the role.Then we had Michael Biehn, an underrated actor, delivering a memorable performance as Kyle Reese, and Sarah Connor played iconically by Linda Hamilton.Terminator 2, for me, was the absolute apex of the series. We had the central cast back again and Edward Furlong put in a good performance as young John Connor. Somehow Michael Edwards' 20 second appearance as Future John Connor was the absolute best in the whole series too, selling the fearsome image of the man John was going to become simply by robotically surveying the battlefield with his scarred and grimly set face.And who can forget Robert Patrick as the T-1000? He doesn't breathe when he runs, he never blinks, and even when trying to be ""friendly"" there is something completely insidious about him. The absolute best antagonist in the Terminator franchise.T2 had themes. Responsible versus irresponsible use of science, whether AI can truly be human, determinism versus free will. It also offered a lot of commentary on how humans are naturally stupid and self destructive (""It is in your nature to destroy yourselves."")Then T3 came along. Oh dear.Not only did all of the central core cast of the previous movies, sans Arnie, completely disappear but the film immediately misunderstands what made the previous films great.The Terminator movies were never about huge explosions or massive action set pieces. Those things happened of course, but they weren't the central attraction of the films. What made them so good was the motif of humans working together to prevent a horrific future brought about by human hubris, greed and arms racing.T3 by contrast is all explosions, throwaway misplaced comedy and no brain.The TX is basically ""The T-1000 but more better-er"" because it can smuggle big guns in it's arms.Yet it's not better. It's nowhere near as scary as the T-1000 because it acts really stupidly, barely even bothering to disguise itself. The one time it puts on a disguise, it randomly removes it in broad daylight right in front of it's victim for no reason, allowing them to escape.The T-1000 never needed big plasma guns because it was stealthy and frighteningly intelligent. It understood that people trust police officers and so it disguised as one. It socially manipulated people and abused the authority it's disguise gave it. It never revealed itself in the open unless it was sure it could get away with it.The T-1000 could be your mother, it could be your father, it might even just be disguising itself as the floor under your chair until it has the opportunity to silently stab you to death. And it would do so efficiently and emotionlessly. Terrifying.The T-X by contrast seems to have bizarre emotions, weird quirky habits (shoving blood soaked rags in it's mouth?) and it's first transformation isn't played for horror, but for laughs as it enlarges it's boobies. Really?Nick Stahl as Connor is rather miscast, he is a whiny washout who spends most of the movie ineffectually being useless or whinging (an annoying pattern every movie since seems to have jumped on, totally neutering Connor).But perhaps the worst crime the movie commits is in clumsily making Judgement Day ""inevitable"". The film offers no sensible logic for why this is, but the message is clear: Fate is fate, don't even bother to change things. Why even get up in the morning?Wow, what a stupid message!Terminator 2 was a very dark film, but it ends on an uplifting note when Sarah comments that ""If a Terminator can learn the value of human life, perhaps we can too."" The whole theme of T1 and 2 was that by acting sensibly, compassionately and using science responsibly, humans can make a bright future for themselves rather than a terrible one.Meanwhile the message of T3 is ""Just do whatever you want, it's all pre-determined and there's no point to anything."" and yet at the same time ""We must fight robots for some reason.""T3 established the same tired pattern in all subsequent Terminator movies; increasingly silly twists, rampant CGI, over the top new ""better"" Terminators that lack all the subtlety and menace of the original T-1000 and weak casting.I for one hope they just let the ""franchise"" die now, in my mind nothing after T2 is canon, simple as.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

The story is good. The acting is just fine. Loken does great as the TX and the Crane car-chase scene was nothing short of awesome.I have seen Dark Fate and even though it's a great movie in it's own right, I really felt there was no need for it, as this movie carried on the saga just fine.Anyway, ignore all the hate on this website and enjoy the show.

414,DP-4,"Good, But Not as Good as T2",5,2 July 2003,"T3 is a solid final installment (or so we think) of the Terminator series. The plot pretty much works, the action is consistent throughout the movie and the ending was actually pretty good as well.The acting was generally weak. Casting for this film, outside of the 2 Terminators, was not done well. However, Arnold somewhat makes up for the weak acting by providing some rather comical one-liners throughout the movie that bring a smile to your face. Kristanna Loken also does a great job as the 2nd Terminator. She was every bit as good as Robert Patrick in T2, and he was a hard act to follow.Overall, T2 was the best of the 3 movies, not T3. There is nothing ground breaking in T3. However, T3 is an enjoyable movie with a decent story line and a lot of fun/action throughout the film. It is a must-see for true Terminator fans, and it is a respectable way to say goodbye to this story. (7/10).",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

I watched the two previous films before seeing T3, and it really struck me that these films are more about hardcore action then a believable plot.  Not so with this film.  They brought back much of the writing talent from the first Terminator and it definitely shows.  People may complain about the lack of blood in this film, but I think it adds a sense of reality and suspense that it would not have otherwise.  There are plenty of explosions and action for the less intelligent, but for once these have been put second to good science fiction.  I've seen many films that have not managed this mix well. This film pokes fun at its occasional cheesiness so that we know the writers are sure where it's going.

After all is just a movie is not like a vital part of history. So I will keep it short.Not a bad movie. The action scenes are well worthy of a Terminator franchise. The main problem I have with this film is mostly the character of ""John Connor"". Maybe it was the writers or maybe just the actor who was wrongly casted. I don't know.In the first film they start with this mystical image of the one man responsible for the survival of the human race ""John Connor"" In the second film we have a smart, witty and somehow strong representation of the kid who will become the leader of the resistance against the machine.However; in this film we have a sissy, insecure, scary cat with an amazing lack of confidence dude by the name of ""John Connor"". The portrayal of the character was pathetic. Are you telling that this joke of a man will be the saviour of the human race. Sad.Then the other problem I have with this movies is that stupid scene was the one where Arnold gets reprogrammed by the T-X. John Connor asks the T-800 not to kill him and the Terminator obeys. Reese said in part 1 It can't be bargained with"" and now John did just that. Sad. I couldn't believe what I was seeing.Anyhow, I promised I would keep it short so I will.Seeya",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
417,Brawl_666,"Mediocre, and deliberately so...",2,19 October 2009,"I have no idea how James Cameron, assuming that he did see this, did not reach for his sleeping pills. Michael Bay & Paul Anderson are unjustly derided as the worst directors working today; none of their films, with maybe the exception of Pearl Harbor, are less than watchable. The crown must belong to Jonathan Mostow, who with this mega-abortion proves himself to be the most soulless capitalist whore of them all.It wasn't necessary that this film had to be so abysmally bad - it could have been watchable and reasonably competent even without trying anything radical. But the brazen approach that Mostow and the producers have chosen, to rehash all and change squat, to deliberately aim for the lowest possible denominator, this is the epitome of the most abhorrent and depressing attitudes in mainstream film-making. Of course, these smug a-holes can get away with it because they know there's a ready market for car chases & special effects that don't alter from one film to the next. There's a ready crowd of idle, passive, self-professed ""fans"" who can be whipped into a viewing frenzy by means of bombastic advertising, plus industry-endorsed film pundits who only care about their paychecks, and nobody will be the wiser. The loser at the end of day is the average movie-goer who has no idea he has been film-flammed by marketing.T3 takes place entirely in movieland, where nothing is real or plausible or of any consequence. Its the passive film-viewer's most delirious fantasy come alive. It has ""cash-in"" plastered all over it. The thing couldn't possibly get worse, till you notice that this film scores 6.7/10 at IMDb and 70% at RT. The ""tongue-in-cheek"" humor that everyone was clamoring about is revolting.

418,bbc-2,"Far away, so close",8,25 August 2003,"I am a big fan of the Terminator franchise. I think T1 was brilliant, while T2 was an excellent sequel. That being said, I had very low expectations for the T3 film: there was no James Cameron, no Edward Furlong, the trailers were suprisingly unimpressive and I simply didn't think there should even be a sequel, since T2 seemed so conclusive.What I did get was something maybe worse than a bad movie: an unfulfilled potential.The special FX are OK, not impressive, but it should be noted that the bar is extremely high for the FX, so one can't expect to be blown away as easily as in, say, 1991. Kristanna Loken is a good T-X, Claire Danes is a solid addition and Nick Stahl is good enough not to think about Furlong.What surprised me the most is that the story actually made sense. There really was room for this sequel to be made, and the ending really showed that T3 had the potential to be an excellent exclamation point to the Terminator series. However, it didn't go that way. Mostow's direction is simply not suitable for the Terminator atmosphere. Action sequences look as in any recent blockbuster, the jokes simply are out of place and there is no 'dark' feeling the previous 2 movies had. It seems as Mostow simply didn't take this movie serious enough to make it as good as it could have been. In the end, I couldn't say T3 is a bad movie, but it simply should have been much, much better.

Here are some of the ""goodies"" what you can expect when you go to see T3:1. jokes and humour with references to previous films - which very quickly grow very, very old (""she'll be back""). 2. far too long and tedious action scenes (and I love the Matrix, T1, T2, etc and action in general). 3. plot holes with a B-movie, low-budget quality to them. MANY of these.This is the one film where I cannot get myself to agree with or understand the IMDB rating it has gotten. One of the worst, dullest films I've ever seen, has at this moment a 7.1 IMDB rating. IMO it deserves something around the 3.0-5.0 mark.

Lots of big sci-fi flicks have come and gone since T2 so I had my doubts whether this was going to be any good or I'd feel the same but right from the start I got into it. I also had doubts about the female terminator but it wasn't too corny still the T1000 was more menacing. I figured out how they would kill the T-X when I saw the damaged energy cell explode in the desert and I never figure endings out. Speaking of the ending, I thought it was much better than the other two yet a little depressing. Ok so what didn't I like, I wish this were made a few years earlier, the whole feel was more ominous and we got to see some more future battles and more cool new machines (T-4 anyone?) 8/10",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
422,DrLex,Redundant,6,30 March 2005,"I watched this movie, knowing that after T2 the only possibility to make a sequel would be to break with the existing storyline somehow and come up with something as 'Hollywood-plausible' as the trick used to justify ""Alien: resurrection"". So I expected nothing more than an action movie, probably combining elements from the two previous movies, using more special effects, more spectacular explosions, and contemporarily adding the obligatory woman beating up men. And I was kind of right. The one-liners were there, the spectacular chases, the CGI effects, the explosions, and a female terminator sowing death and destruction and grabbing Arnie in the crotch. *WARNING: MAJOR SPOILERS BELOW!* I won't go into detail about all the holes in the plot, because this has been done in countless reviews before. Something I haven't read during a sampling of the thousands of reviews, is that at the end, Connor says something like the Terminator has tricked them into the nuclear shelter. This would fit with the dialog right after the chase in the funeral car, when the Terminator at first didn't seem to want to change its objective of leading Connor and Brewster to a safe place in Mexico. Maybe it knew about the Crystal Peak shelter and tricked them into believing they could take out Skynet, but actually lead them to that shelter. However, the only reason why they went there, is that Brewster's dad said the Skynet mainframe is located there. Or maybe I was so confused about all the other plot holes that I got this wrong, whatever. One thing I don't understand about many of the reviews here is that people find it so obvious that this movie ought to have a T4 sequel. Maybe they didn't catch Arnie's last phrase ""We'll meet again"" which IMHO only refers to the fact that Connor will be killed by this very terminator in the future, as explained during the conversation in the van. Actually I believe this movie has literally blown up every chance for an interesting sequel which still has something in common with the Terminator movies as we know them. The earth is nuked, which only leaves an opportunity to make a movie which is one long battle scene in a post-apocalyptic world, the kind we saw a few of in the first two movies as flash-forwards - or flash-backs if you want. In other words, this would be something like Mad Max but then with dimmed lights and robots, which are so numerous and strong that it'll require loads of 'Hollywood-plausibility' to avoid the only real plausible outcome, being the eradication of humanity. There is no room for anything of the stuff that made the first movies interesting. But apparently, many people want to see robots beating the crap out of humans during two hours until they are all dead. Well, I don't. Not even Cameron would be able to make an interesting movie out of that. Overall, I found this a redundant addition to the two existing excellent movies. It didn't work as a sequel, nor as a tribute, nor as a parody, only as an action movie to pass the time on an otherwise boring evening.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

427,Habibi-Universe,Oh... Claire Danes...,4,11 November 2020,"Well... that was a downer!
Jonathan Mostow's 'Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines' (2003) is the third film in the 'Terminator' franchise and it tells the story of a machine from a post-apocalyptic future traveling back in time to protect a man and a woman from an advanced robotic assassin to ensure they both survive a nuclear attack.This film has some serious problems! I am genuinely somewhat shocked by the number of people that actually believe that this is a good film. This film has the word ""generic"" written all over it! It also fails to satisfy at the end of the day. One of my biggest problems with this film was Claire Danes's character Kate Brewster who I just find super annoying and stupid! In my opinion her character could have been completely cut out of the film and it wouldn't have changed anything (with slight adjustments of course). I am not blaming Claire Danes! I blame the writing team who decided to include her character with the obvious goal of trying to replace Sarah Connor, an attempt that failed miserably!Arnold Schwarzenegger was solid as the Terminator, however he did show a little too much emotion during some of the scenes which is obviously not how we got to know the Terminator character! I also didn't really care all that much about John Connor. The only reason why I felt something for the character, was because of the great character arc he had in 'Terminator 2: Judgment Day'!In my opinion this film actually slaps the previous two 'Terminator' films in the face the way 'The Matrix Revolutions' (2003) did it to the 'Matrix' franchise!Having said all of those negative things about this film, I do actually have quite a number of aspects that I really like about this film! Personally I find the pacing of the movie to be good and the action sequences were also nice to look at (despite not being as good as in the first two). On top of that I somewhat liked the villain!
Finally let me talk about the ending of this film! I thought it was pretty unsatisfying, HOWEVER I did not expect it and it did set-up a fourth film pretty nicely by laying the cards open! I definitely appreciate this type of boldness from the writers and basically everybody else who went along with it!Overall 'Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines' is a film with many flaws, yet it still offers an experience worthwhile for audiences worldwide thanks to fun action sequences! 4/10",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

I also though it had more solid acting, for the most part. Kudos to Arnold for being able to whip himself into shape for this role! Does this man ever age? One thing I wondered about is why they never explained why this cyborg was female.  Also, isn't it a step backwards from the robot we saw in the last movie?

430,J. Ryan,"Saved by the Story. James Cameron, where are you?",6,6 July 2003,"T3 suffers from the ""Matrix Syndrome,"" the need to outdue and surpass its predecessors with bigger, bolder, more blast-worthy action.  Chases and nitroglycerine abound in this film as characterization is pushed to the background.To be fair, very little characterization is needed except for the Claire Danes character.  Unless you've been living in an isolated commune for the past 20 years, you know the Terminator.  Arnold's persona has become pop culture myth -- like the Six Million Dollar Man writ large.  Stahl's character, John Connor, is still the ordinary man tormented by his awesome destiny.T3 does deliver the stunts, the explosions, even the catchy one-liners to which we've become accustomed.  Arnold's performance is stellar.  His charm breathes humanity into an automaton (Gov. Schwarzenegger one day perhaps?). Stahl is competent, while Danes is immeasurably underused.  Note her role as Juliet in Baz Luhrman's Romeo and Juliet -- but hey, this isn't Henry James. Kristanna Loken is good as well, sexily exuding VERY homicidal tendencies.Yet beyond the action, T3 main point of interest is the story.  While the first 2 films touch upon existentialism and self-determination (""There's no fate but what you make"" is a recurring theme), this film does a 180 and focuses on destiny.  The ending is intriguing, a little 12 Monkeys-que, and certainly depressing.I agree with Roger Ebert in saying that T3 is really a dumbed down version of its history.

I was, then, unexpectedly excited and thoroughly pleased that I changed my mind and decided to satisfy my curiosity about this further inevitable chapter in the saga of John Connor. The movie begins with action and special effects, and continues with action and SFX unrelentingly. It kept me on the edge of my seat throughout.

Strike One. Then the news hit me that James Cameron opted out on this movie. Strike Two. Then I actually saw the movie. Strike three, Hollywood sucks!First, there is almost no resemblance between T3 and its predecessors, plot wise. Here there is enough plot to satisfy your typical big-budget summer movie. Yet there were enough continuity and plot holes that I felt empty myself. I've had bowel movements more satisfying than the plot of this movie, which absolutely destroys the beauty of ""There is no fate but what we make for ourselves."" But for the masses, this is the movie of the summer. It's all action and forced humor. The entrance of Arnold was not entertaining, nor was him using ""Talk to the hand."" Ick...Acting...well, it wasn't as bad as ""Battlefield Earth"" but it wasn't good either. Kristianna Loken is a pretty face, and she is nowhere near as frightening and creepy as Robert Patrick. But he also had a score that made him creepy. Arnold is back to what he did well once, but that is no longer there. Here, he tries to channel the Arnold of T2, and fails. Nick Stahl wasn't a bad choice, and continuity wise, I'm glad they chose him instead of Edward Furlong. Furlong just doesn't have the charisma or brooding sense that Nick Stahl brought to John Connor's role. Claire Danes, forgettable, just like the minor characters that pop up here and there.
The humor...wasn't funny. Trying to make Arnold into a comedian is nearly as bad as making Gimli a comedian. It doesn't fit, it isn't funny, and most of all, it made me want to vomit. The action is where this movie shines, and that's it. The car chase is phenominal. The fights between the TX and the T800, uh, T101...??? (it was T-800, Cyberdyne Systems Model 101 in the previous films) are very cool. All in all, the action makes this movie. For being an all-round disappointment for me, it was entertaining.

433,Jenny Ho,Exceeds what one might expect from a sequel,8,2 September 2003,"The story will be familiar to followers of the series so far: a cyborg killing machine is sent back in time from a future where machines rule the Earth, to eliminate John Connor, the future rebel leader and saviour of humanity.  At the same time, a good Terminator' in the form of a T-101 model (i.e. Schwarzenegger) is sent back with the mission to keep Connor alive for the day when the Skynet system is due to launch its first attack on humanity.  This may sound mostly like a tiresome rerun of  Terminator 2' but apparently, Sarah and John Connor did not prevent Judgment Day in Terminator 2' they only postponed it!  Also, the twist and selling point here, is that this time the baddie' is T-X, a female supermodel Terminator' which is far superior to the T-101 (an obsolete model').Of the original main cast, only Arnie is back; Sarah Connor is dead as Linda Hamilton did not want to star in another sequel and Edward Furlong has been replaced by Nick Stahl to play John Connor.  Another new face to the cast is Claire Danes who gives an appealing performance as the suitably bewildered and vulnerable girl destined to be John Connor's wife.  With a delay of twelve years since T2 Judgment Day' was released, Schwarzenegger's career on the decline and him revisiting the role for a third instalment, there is obviously a lot of pressure on this one to deliver the goods, and it certainly does.  Schwarzenegger is key to much of the fun of the film; his delivery of one-liners with robotic seriousness and Austrian accent is superb.  As a result, I found the film hilarious in parts.  At the start of the film, there is a re-run of two cyborgs being zapped back from the future nude and this makes for one of the funniest scenes in the film where a naked Arnie strides into Ladies night at a bar to be mistaken for a stripper by the raucous attendees.  He then steals the stage dancer's leather biker costume before trying on his star-shaped shades he off course soon ditches these for the by now familiar and way cooler black shades!  A lot of excitement is to be had from the film's action set-pieces and chases and this is down to the relentlessness of the T-X who like her predecessor, can shape herself into another human being and pull herself back together whatever gun you use to shoot at her.  Surprisingly, the ending is affecting as it reflects the inevitability of Connor's future role as a leader despite his reluctance to believe throughout.  Also, (I actually feel a bit silly for admitting it) I was unexpectedly moved by the scene where the T-101 struggles to override the corruption that the T-X has implanted in his program so that he alternates between conflicting missions of killer/protector of John Connor.I have to admit that I didn't totally get the plot and was a bit lost with regards the references to the Skynet system.  However, if you just go with the flow and don't think too much about the story, Terminator 3 makes for undemanding entertainment.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
434,shulmanator,Decent script. Weak Execution.,6,11 November 2003,"Having seen this film 12 years after the great T2, I was hoping to feel as involved in the characters and feel the realism of the action like I did in T2, but I felt nothing, from start to finish.  I didn't feel like this was a terminator movie.  This was more of a TV pilot to translate T2 into a show for Showtime.The storyline is surprisingly decent, but not very strong and catchy.  It ultimately feels conveluted and made up only to make more money and not to continue the story.  It's like hiring a soap opera writer to create a sequel to Romeo & Juliet.  I liked the ""future wife"" aspect of the story, and making Judgement Day inevitable just took everything we were told to believe in the second film, and threw it out.  So much for the whole moral of ""There's no fate but what we make for ourselves"".  I guess you can't make much more money if you end the series that way, so they ignored it, and squeezed this one out of an orafice.The Connor family that we've grown to care about was suddenly gone, with only a glued-on backstory to explain the changes.The new John Connor has no or little tension in his acting.  Nothing about him makes me feel he's real.  He starts off as a cliche' depressed teenager. He claims to be a loner, but I just don't feel he's anything more than another hot young face being dragged across the latest magazine covers to sucker us into thinking he's important.  We spend little time getting to know Claire Daines, and feel nothing for her.The new Terminatrix is played by some apparent model who does a fairly good job by simply pretending to be Robert Patrick from the second installment. The only difference in her performance from Patrick is the special effects that are done with her.  She comes with a flamethrower, a magic internet key spike, and a lack of ability to mimic other people.  Personally, I think the T-1000 (Patrick) was a much better villain.  He could slip through small cracks and holes to get to his enemy, and couldn't get stuck to a magnet.The whole Skynet headquarters, or whatever you want to call it, looks like a cheap rejected set from Stargate SG-1, as well as the characters and their wardrobe.  Nothing about these people are believable, so again, we feel nothing.In some scenes (Endoskeletons in battle, Arnold missing half his flesh, and Terminatrix losing her metal skin on a magnet) the CGI effects are top of the line.  They feel real.  However the scenes involving the CG Hovercrafts and nuclear explosion of central LA look incredibly fake. You can see the individual circular CG puffs that make up the mushroom cloud. The chrome surfacing on the Hovercrafts look like something from The Lawnmower Man. They look completely untangible, and I don't feel the suspense of their presence. I could see how hard they were trying to convince us that it was real by having a harsh brushed-metal surface, while the previous practical counterparts were just a simple soft polish.  You only should use CG where you have no choice.  In this case, they believe erasing a few strings from a hovering model isn't as effective to them as replacing the entire thing with unfinished-looking CGI. Also, I'm not in suspense when I'm supposed to fear being crushed by noticeably CG vehicles.The worst problem with T3 in my opinion is the cinematography.  It's not horrible DP work, but it doesn't have that ""we're involved in the action"" feel that the second film had.  This felt like we were spectators, rather than players.  The lighting didn't feel suspensful.  The editing had little rhythm.  The choices for camera angles were uninvolving.  It's like for each moment of the story, they had to spin a roulette wheel of storyboard angles for the same shot, and whatever the needle landed on, that was the camera angle they chose.Since the script is the heart of a production, I give it more credit than I normally would.  6/10",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
435,mr_walsh,Entertaining but Shallow,7,19 July 2003,"Appropriately, many large trucks haul the terminators and co through this movie.  I say 'appropriately', because this movie contains an inordinate amount of holes which such vehicles could drive through.Clearly, Cameron had sewn his movie shut with no intention of a sequel.  We all remember him saying 'T3 without me!' some years back.  Like Alien3, the allure of $$ drove the writers to open up what the creator wanted shut. Most people couldn't care less about this sort of thing, but to me it makes it hard for me to suspend my disbelief.T3 lacks continuity from the characters of its predecessors.  This John Connor to me just doesn't fit - he's wimpy, seems to have forgotten what he did in T2, and doesn't have the hard edge he had in T2.  The absence of Linda Hamilton, or perhaps any strong human character, diminishes the entire human/robot dynamic.And while the humor in prior T* movies stemmed from plausible situations that a terminator would run into, you can see right through each of the staged jokes in T3.  You find yourself laughing, but it feels like 'Airplane' humor.But in spite of all this, T3 certainly gave me a couple hours of entertainment.  I can't get enough of robots destroying things, quite honestly.  Yes, as an engineer I cringe each time I see how easily the movie sidesteps such issues as the weight of a Terminator, the need for amazing amounts of friction between their feet and the ground, and how a clearly visible metallic backpack buckle somehow ignores magnetic forces.So, while I clearly enjoyed the entertaining action and eyecandy, I missed the depth of the T* films which transcended a cheap action movie.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

The third is just what you think it is: little better than an afterthought. The parts are there: The situation is urgent, The new Terminator is terrifying, and Arnold's bot is milked for even more genuinely funny deadpan, but with a surfeit of choppy action and dearth of any other emotional material, you're left with a movie that doesn't take itself seriously enough to warrant the audience's loyalty. Not to mention the unforgivable lapses in logic and decidedly unintelligent hunting techniques of the new cyborg. The buddy I went with remarked about the lack of pause or reflection that made the previous films relatively moving experiences and I agree; without them, the franchise has devolved into an extended chase sequence.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

Not that much different. Did I miss Linda Hamilton? No. Did I miss Edward Furlong? Hell, no! Did I miss James Cameron? --- Hm, there's a certain emotional factor that Cameron would have inserted during the whole film, instead of just the ending.Anyway, especially for a follow up of an all time classic, I will give it 10 / 10 stars.There's one major plot hole ... but you can ignore that easily.Go watch it.Btw. the chase scenes are better than the one in the Matrix.

441,UberNoodle,Crappy sequels make little baby Jesus cry ...,6,15 June 2005,"The original film was ""WOW!"". The first sequel too but with an lighthearted injection of fun. This second sequel (T3) inspires the same exclamation but purely for the mystery that it was ever made at all. OK that IS a bit rough, but forgive me for ever thinking the T2's ""Dark Road At Night"" ending provided some finality to the story! According to Terminator 3, you can't beat fate after all, and Arnie is back for the ride. Skynet was of course smarter than the heroes thought and is up to it's old time traveling tricks again. This time it sends back a girl Terminator and 'luckily' the good guys manage (again) to send back their own as well, in the form of Arnie (again).Yes, a whole manner of repetition, but sadly the greatness of the first two isn't part of that. Granted, there is some great action such as a fantastic car chase, and there are some good one liners from Arnie (isn't that a given?), but the story is beyond 'paint by numbers. Most of the characters exist only to the further of the plot and many of those advancements are just end up being far too convenient. Finally, without spoiling it, the ending just isn't as well thought out as it could have been. It poses an idea that while clever at first, falls apart under scrutiny.When it comes to the crunh, Terminator 3 is a simpe action romp with some great effects and visuals. It is good to see Arnie reprise his role as the T800. However, to be part of the Terminator series, I feel that a film has to more than that and more sophisticated than this derivative sequel. Watch for the sake of completion, but just like Alien Resurrection, this film is a bit of a blight.****SPOILER****The rationale of the film was that Skynet used the Internet to survive destruction, by copying itself onto thousands, if not millions of computers around the world. The idea is that, like the Internet, Skynet couldn't be destroyed completely - break one part of the web and the system can connect via another route. It is a great idea but after the world is decimated by nuclear war, where does all the electricity come from to run these computers and thus maintain the Internet? Forget for a moment that the infrastructure the network depends on would be severely damaged. Skynet, future ruler of the world and humanity, is going to try to take control on a handful of Pentium 2's with dial-up connections? Remember, it is 1999 in this film.****SPOILER COMPLETE****",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
442,FargoUT,Time Travel for Dummies,8,6 July 2003,"!!! WARNING: SPOILERS !!!""Terminator 3"" is not a great film, but it is a very good one.  Lacking is the intense score by Beltrami, the sense of doom and dread in every shot, and the gritty atmosphere created by James Cameron.  As a technical film, it is expertly handled.  But it is missing its artistic vision.  Jonathan Mostow is a competent (even talented) director--see ""Breakdown"" for an excellent suspense film--but he was given the task of taking care of another director's baby.In trying to satisfy all the prerequisite elements of the Terminator films, he seems to have sacrificed the essence of them.  They're gritty, violent, doom-filled stories about the end of the world.  ""Terminator 3"" occasionally achieves that sense of defeat, particularly in the final ten minutes.  But with all the mayhem and action sequences, there doesn't seem to be an urgency about them.  It's an excellent summer flick, but don't expect the kind of grandeur that the first two films exhibited.With that being said, ""Terminator 3"" almost seemed essential (and makes me wonder why James Cameron didn't want to make it).  If, as James Cameron's films stated, John Connor sent his own father back in time to protect his mother, he would not exist if Judgment Day did not occur.  This makes for a paradox--how can someone exist if their father is from the future?  The future must be set, and if the future is set, what we decide can't change it.  It could take hundreds of films to adequately deal with the implications here.  An episode of ""The Outer Limits"" dealt with this nicely--a woman changed her life by going back in time and ""correcting"" all the problems.  Every time she came back, her brain was forced with another lifetime of memories.  If you've fixed all the problems in your past, there is no reason for you to go back in time.  Your present would be altered without repair.In all actuality, there could be no movie about the events portrayed in the ""Terminator"" films.  Granted, this is taking it way beyond the sci-fi roots and trying to ground the films far too much in reality.  But hypothetically speaking, the moment a robot is sent from the future, everything would change.  If a robot was sent to the past, and it was meant to destroy a certain person, then its very existence proves its failure inevitable.  If it did succeed in killing a particular person, then the moment it arrives in the past, it would vanish--there would be no need for this robot to be sent back in time to kill that person.  Seeing as how killing the person would alter the future, why would they need to send a robot back?  How could the future be dead-set if it can be changed so simply?  Something not dealt with in time travel films--how does time travel affect the past and present as well?  If you send a terminator back, and they complete their mission, your present is no longer the same, you would not have to send a machine back in time to kill that person--they'd be dead from the previous timeline.  So there must be infinite timelines--and time travel would simply be traveling from one version of time to another.  The theories of time travel really give me a headache if I think too deeply about them.Another thought: sending something back in time is probably an impossible task.  It is well beyond the limits of my own mind.  If you send someone back in time, it is the present to everyone else.  This would mean to those people that the future is set, that it has already occurred. 
""Terminator 3"" deals with all of this, though hidden beneath layers.  You have to dig to figure it out--it doesn't tell you everything.  That's one of the impressive traits of Mostow's film.  The script smartly gives us the questions, but lets us delve into them.  If John Connor is killed by one of the Terminators, then the future is changed, and John Connor can not send his own father back to protect his mother.  Talk about your mind-warps!While this is merely just scratching the surface of the paradoxes time travel theory creates, it is after all, just a movie.  ""Terminator 3"" has a decent cast (Kristanna Loken leaves a bit to be desired, although she acts about as much like a killing robot as I would expect one to act), a well-written script, and a talented director.  The action is above par, and sometimes downright brutal.  Best yet, the ending is a downer, a surprise that caught me off guard.  That a big-budget film would attempt such an ending (and intelligently deal with it) makes me feel a little more generous with my rating of the film.  All in all, I recommend this one as a good continuation of James Cameron's imaginative story, although lacking his artistic creativity.Rating: 3 stars out of 4 (*** out of ****)",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
443,dgeer80,Better than expected...,8,29 March 2004,"...of course, my expectations were not that it was going to be better or even as good at T2. There was just no way that would happen. So I was expecting it to be as good as Demolition Man or something(which I thought was just ok).Turns out, T3 was way better than Demolition Man! And I personally thought it was as good as the first Terminator movie.We had awesome action sequences(especially the chase with the crane!), witty one-liners(which every Arnold movie MUST have!), and a decent plot that didn't seem as depressing as one would think it would be. Nick Stahl was great as John Conner. He's a better actor than Edward Furlong, although he doesn't look much like what Eddy looks like. Claire Daines' character was a good new character too. The T-X was the hottest robot I've ever seen, and she was one tough machine! But I'm glad they didn't make a big deal out of her, and focused more on the plot of judgement day. And the twist of the T-800(Arnold) killing John Connor in the future, as well as judgement day actually happening sets us up for a great new kind of new Terminator movie for T4(if it gets made), because it could take place in a post-apocolyptic world with the human surviors battling against the machines. It wouldn't be the classic ""good terminator gets sent back in time to protect Connor/bad terminator gets sent back in time to kill Connorz"" scenario. It could be taken to a whole other level because of the plot of T3!Good movie, great set up for T4![END SPOILER]",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
444,BruddanChrist,An unnecessary sequel,6,31 March 2008,"Everything that needed to be said and done was done so in Terminator 2. (Quite nicely, I might add.) There was absolutely no need to make enough another Terminator movie, proving that T3 was simply nostalgic masturbation on the studio's part.Terminator 3 is basically one big homage to Terminator 2. There's nothing in T3 that wasn't done (and done better) in T2. Cameron clearly had a better handle on the story than Mostow, who spent the whole movie trying to convince the audience that he can throw down with the big boys. Reality, however, is against him, since T3 is nowhere near as entertaining as T2.With the exception of Arnold, T3 has just about everything going against it. Claire Daines looks very out of place in this movie, Nick Stahl is a horrible John Conner, and the two have little to no chemistry together. The special effects are rather sloppy and the music is pretty mediocre. Even the action scenes aren't as good as T2. It's a twenty-first century Terminator film, but we can only have one expensive sequence (the fire truck)?! The one thing I do like about T3 is the notion that Judgment Day is inevitable. Fate is a time-honored and effective plot device, especially in stories involving time travel. While it doesn't even begin to fill in for the rest of what is lacking T3's plot, at least it provides a somewhat stable backbone.On its own, Terminator 3 is an OK movie. It's flawed, but entertaining. In relation to its predecessors, however, it falls flat on its face. It's obvious that it was simply an effort to restart the franchise and keep the money-hose going.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

447,vaultoverseer_15,The Worst Terminator Movie,1,11 August 2020,"The terminator franchise is terrible after T2, I think most people would agree. While I don't think Dark Fate and Salvation are THAT bad, they are far from good. I hear people commonly talk about this movie and say ""well, it's the worst in the trilogy, but it's far better than the others"". It is not. Rise of the Machines is quite possibly my least favourite big summer blockbuster movie. Here are my main reasons why:1. This is one of the worst instances of retconning. I mostly hate retconning, because it completely neglects deliberate changes made by filmmakers in their stories. If you don't wish to follow the story - make a different movie!!! This movie completely neglects a fantastic conclusion that T2 made. To be fair it is really difficult to have terminators with the ending of T2. I just think that it should have either done something completely new, or realised that the story had ended and to keep going would ruin it.2. Thematically this movie is terrible. Terminator movies aren't exactly deep, but they have an emotional core to them. In T1 it's Sarah Connor excepting her role as father of the world's hero. In T2 it's about resisting fate. In T3 it's about John Connor excepting his role as the world's hero. See the problem? This is a complete 180 of themes. But ignoring that, it's a bad idea to explore. John is being a hero by trying to stop Judgement Day, and the film treats him like he's misguided in doing this. So a hero who wants to go against fate learns to accept fate? That's really pessimistic, and this movie isn't the sort of movie that should have a pessimistic message.3. The action. The action in this movie is TERRIBLE. When I think the Terminator action, I think of visceral, bloody fighting. While this movie is rated R it feels ridiculously tame. The fight scenes between the terminators feel like a bad attempt at the Matrix. Everyone goes flying everywhere, and there is no real impact. Sure, people get hurt but it never feels that way. It just feels like a lot of CGI.4. The visuals. This movie is just terrible to look at. The first two movies had harsh colours of blue to make us feel the universe. Yet this movie (which mind you, ends with the death of billions) is very colourful and saturated in a non stylistic way. It just looks messy. And this is also an early CG movie and - yikes. The way shots move makes you generally think of B-movie schlock. For example, the opening strip club scene is so terribly shot it feels like a reality show. That is not what you want to be thinking while watching a 200 million dollar big franchise movie.5. The characters. John Connor is - okay I guess but i hate what they do with the character. The wife character is so unbelievably one dimensional. She likes her Dad and her husband. And she's scared of trouble. What a fantastic follow up from Sarah Connor! Arnie's character is so robotic that you can't relate to him at all. He's far better in T2. Also the Terminatrix is just strange. Unlike T1 Arnie or the T-1000 she's not threatening at all. And her powers feel too convenient, like sometimes she is very powerful and can do something amazing, and other times you are thinking how she couldn't get out of her dilemma.6. The writing. Omg this movies humor is so insufferable. I don't even want to talk about it.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

Still, unfortunatenot to see Edward Furlong, although Nick Stahl was good andLinda Hamilton was sorely missed.

449,scottand,I have always liked this installment.,9,31 January 2020,"I appreciate this sequel even more after watching the last three Terminator sequels which were all awful and forgettable, especially Dark Fate. I wasn't expecting much from Terminator 3 since most sequels go downhill fast and the second sequel usually scrapes the bottom of the barrel but the chase scene near the beginning was a truly bracing experience that made me sit up and take notice.I liked the fact that the Terminator was a female in this one. I have always liked seeing woman in action flicks doing things that we are used to seeing men do. Also, having a female Terminator followed the logic of Terminator 2 where subsequent Terminators were more streamlined and elegant and yet more powerful than the big and bulky Terminator of the first movie.I am probably one of the few people, if not the only one, who likes T3 more than T2. I appreciate that in T3 the Terminator's mimicking abilities were not taken to the almost comical extent that they were in T2 where in one scene the T1000 liquefied and morphed into a black and white checkerboard floor. That was a bit much for me. I also liked that they began to flesh out the story to explain how the machines ended up taking over. In all, I think this was the LAST decent Terminator movie.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
450,EJBaggaley,Brilliant,7,15 December 2004,"Although this film 'Terminator 3' Rise of the machines wasn't as good as the first two Terminator films, I can still say that I enjoyed this film. Considering how very few of the original actors were in this film, that were in the first two Terminator films, other than Arnold Swartzeneger the Terminator and Earl Boen(Dr.Peter Silberman) who was Sarah Connors Psychiatrist, I thought this film carried itself extremely well. I thought the lighting and special effects were superb and the directors choice of making the new Terminator into a woman was a great and original idea. In many ways I found this sequel somewhat more humorous compared to the other Terminator films, a humour that the other films lacked. The scene when the Terminatrix(Kristanna Loken) breasts grew larger after looking at the large breasted women on the billboard poster and when Arnold Swartzeneger(the Terminator) walked into the strip club in the nude, for everybody thought that he was a stripper hired by the nightclub, I found extremely funny. I did, however, find it unrealistic when the Terminator was deprogrammed by the Terminatrix to become bad and then mentally fought his deprogramming to remain good and managing to shut his system down. That was so unreal! Why - because the Terminator is a Cyborg, not a person. It doesn't have feelings of its own. Its programmed to follow his orders - nothing more. As all Terminator fans know, that John Connors father(Kyle Rhys) who was one of John Connors Sergeants in the future was sent back in time to the year 1984 to save Johns mother(Sarah Connor) from being killed by the Terminator. It would have been good if the Terminator named John Connors fathers name(Kyle Rhys) to John Connor(Nick Stahl) and Kate Brewster(Claire Danes) when he was telling them the listed names of the Terminatrix' assassin hitlist, who were John Connors top Sergeants/ Lieutenants in the future, that she was planning to kill. That would have been ironic for this film, for his father(Kyle Rhys) was one of John Connors top Sergeants in the year 2027, but unfortunately his name wasn't mentioned on that list. Then again, it was only fair that he wasn't on the hit list for Kyle Rees wasn't alive in the year 1997 as he was born in the year 2006. Despite the ways I feel this film could have improved, I still very much enjoyed it and would recommend anybody to watch it, as this film had amazing special effects, exciting action scenes and most of all had a fantastic storyline.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

Then it should be totally banned to change history of events. Fine Judgmentday wasn't supposed to happen. But it happened anyway, well WHAT REASON? there must(!) be a reason for change of history. Perhaps workers found the arm of the limb Terminator in T2 (the one cut off by T-1000 in the end-battle-scene) or some other bull, but things doesn't happen on their own!

452,Calios,Whoa! This is couldn't really happen... could it?,9,6 July 2003,"This the best Terminator movie. The action and movement of the movie is excellent. There are afew mistakes and maybe some liberty is taken with some of theaction, but they do not take anything from the chase or the fights. Istill don't understand the scene with the magnetic field, but will tryto stretch my imagination still a little more to make sense of it. 
Arnold is not as impressive looking as he was in the earliermovies, but he still has muscles even if they may not be as big asthey used to be. The ending makes a lot of sense and leaves theidea wide open for more sequels or a series.The doctor from the earlier Terminator movies makes anappearance which is funny and I wished they used him just a bitmore, but his exit was great comic relief. Arnold did not seem tohave any new quotes, but I got the feeling this will be the last timewe will see this version of the Terminator. Maybe Big Lou (The realIncredible Hulk) will continue with a version.This movie also teaches that one should be really, REALLY carefulwhat one says ""Yes"" to.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
453,larson.72,Subpar Terminator 2 Rehash,5,17 May 2006,"The thing that struck me most about Terminator 3 was how liberally it borrows from T2. Once again, we're trying to stave off judgment day. Once again, a shape-shifting robot who is sent back in time to kill John Connor, and another Arnold is sent back in time to protect him. There's another vehicle scene, the initial confrontation between the terminators, etc. The problem is, the plot just isn't all that interesting because we've already seen it all done and done better in T2, with better actors too. It's too bad Edward Furlong was dropped from this project because I have a feeling it would have been much better with him onboard reprising his role as John Connor. Having Linda Hamilton and maybe even Robert Patrick would've been nice too. As it was, though, Claire Danes and Nick Stahl just didn't really cut it, in terms of likability or chemistry. Kristianna Loken was not a convincing villain as the T-X either. In a nutshell, I think T3 was a so-so rehash that attempted to one-up it's predecessor and fell flat. You might as well just watch T2 again instead...",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
454,edzelr,An Apocalyptic Sequel,7,11 July 2003,"Jonathan Mostow (U-571) did a fantastic job. I wish Jim Cameron would commend him for taking care of his films, Despite that I really missed his directing so as Linda Hamilton, Michael Biehn and Brad Fiedel. Nick Stahl did a good job playing the adult John Connor, So as Kristanna Loken playing T-X...I Love you! And for Claire Danes, I wish the director had chosen another leading lady she doesn't look tough enough.Arnold thanks for doing a sequel again. T3 has an ending with an apocalyptic note, yet filled with messages of Hope. Meaning, it doesn't matter whether you win or lose in a crisis that you're facing in life, but how you survive and endure in those trials and still keep on fighting...If they decide to do more sequels, they must finish the last chapter of the whole termiator saga with a happy ending where humans triumph over the machines eventually.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
455,jonathan45,Terminatrix fails to whip T3 in to shape.,6,22 January 2007,"With this film i suspect they tried to redress the criticisms levelled at the T2 film. Leaving the pubescent behind the film concentrates instead on a twenty something John. His mother is dead and he is living 'off grid', working odd day construction, getting paid in cash and getting drunk. He drives recklessly at night on a bike, in short John Conner is in something of a rut. In to his world the film introduces a new Terminater or 'Terminatrix', dressed in a red leather outfit and tightly pinned back hair Kristianna Loken is the machine a teenage boy with a Sn'M fixation would have built. She severely scans her environment, killing her targets with a sadistic smile playing across her cold, model looks. As a machine she doesn't match up to the other two. Her technology seems neither as intimidatingly huge as Arnie or as strange or sinister than the T2. The special effects are OK ,but nothing unique and the action sequences seemed neither plausible or particularly spectacular. Claire Danes as Johns future wife irritates with her shrill whining, and has little chemistry with her two other leads. Nick Stahl is a talented actor and brings a introspective, confused element to the older john conner. Arnie worked hard to regain a younger mans physique, but there is no hiding his age. More ill advised 'Terminater humour' fell flat with me, and was a poor replacement for a darker tone considering the films theme of a nuclear Apocalypse. The films script has huge plot holes in it and inconsistencies which other reviewers have pointed out. Sadly T3 fell foul of the ringing cash machine behind the script and with a 18 certificate, more adult script it could have been so much better. Since it is inevitable that they will make a T4 i hope they at last make the film T2 and T3 should have been.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
456,saprater,Not even close to the original concept,4,3 July 2003,"Oh, how I wish that I had stayed home. I knew that this movie was going to be the worst of the three, but I didn't realize that it was going to be quite this bad.  I don't know if the people in charge just ran out of ideas or the fact that James Cameron wasn't really involved had that much of an impact on the final product.  Regardless, here are my pros and cons of T3: Rise of the machines.Pros (the smallest list):  Great action sequence and great acting all around from the cast.  Though I wasn't particularly happy with the casting choices in the matter of looks/public appeal/ect...all the actors did a fine job. Especially the in the role of the Terminatrix.  She nailed the cold and dispassionate look down pat.  Too bad they gave her lines like: a seductive ""I like your gun"" and inflatable breasts.  The chase/fight scenes were great.  One scene in particular (crane scnene) was dragged out too long, but overall it was great fun to watch.  Special effects were awesome.Cons (oh where do I start?):  Arnold, though I adore him, definitely showed his age.  Also, his role had too many speaking parts.  Speaking parts are usually good, but for this character and his monotone voice, less is more. Also, they gave him way too many human characteristics than needed.  The opening scene was real cheesy too.  A badly cosmetically aged Stahl standing on a heap of rubble and pumping his arm like some kind of post-war cheerleader.  Gag!  They also tried to recapture the whole romance/fate thing like in the first but it was too obvious and there was no chemistry between the two.  Add in a few subplots which were never resolved or expanded upon and the story pretty much limped along at a choppy pace. 
One thing I loved about T1 and T2 was that the story itself was told fluidly and at a breakneck pace.  The action was consistent.  T3, on the otherhand, was filled with those tired old dramatic pauses which has the audience either shaking his head or yelling at the screen.  John Connor wasting precious moments staring at liquid metal like he'd never seen it before. Talking scenes and poignant looks that have the characters actually STOPPING in the middle of a chase sequence.  In ""real life"" they would have been wasted!  Overall, it was just waaay too typical of every other bubble-gum scifi/horror flick in the past.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
457,shaunephillips28,The 1st in a long line of unwanted sequels,6,19 June 2021,"When Terminator 2 came out Arnold was at the height of his career and the franchise was at an all time high. People had been waiting for the sequel for years and Terminator 2 didn't disappoint.When 3 came out, there wasn't really any high hopes. It came out at a time when there was a ton of unwanted sequels only being made to cash in and this was one of them.The story is completely forced, the actors aren't that good, it lacks character depth, it's poorly written and lifeless. If there was going to be a 3rd movie, it needed to be dark in tone and serious in nature, but instead we get a, ""talk to the hand"" line. This movie suffers from early 2000's comedy in action movies. The comedy is inappropriate for what the movie is supposed to be. We're talking about saving the humane race and Arnold is trying on glasses meant for 70s Elton John.It's not the worst in the series, but close to it. By the time this movie came out I kept thinking why doesn't any one just use some acid on these terminators and a few sequels they finally do. When the holes in the series become obvious, it's time to stop.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
458,John-423,"A Unworthy and less than stellar ""comedy""... Not The REAL Terminator.",5,6 July 2003,"You know in the last 10 years American film making has suffered horribly in the way that it plays up movie clichés, and things that are perceived as comic relief, this film serves as a prime example of how to take a no brainer and mock what you are actually trying to accomplish. The first problem comes in that Arnold is no longer just a caricature of himself in the publics minds, but now he's a caricature of that caricature in the movie itself if that makes any sense. Having him spout off one liners just for the sake of one liners is really sad, and unlike the typical ""comic relief"" that pollutes films now days its was way overdone in the first hour or so almost to the point I was feeling embarrassed as a fan of the series. It was almost like they were trying to make you forget they actually had a real struggle in the movie and that the t-850 was there to be a joke, hell if that was the case why didn't they just hire Rob Schneider as the threat? LISTEN UP HOLLYWOOD some of us LOVE these kinds of films, why ""fix"" what's not broken??? Comic relief is fine if used right, but as this film goes it was poorly wrote and badly placed. The TX or Terminatrix was pretty lame as well, but much of that had to do with the way she was shot, and not just how bad her acting was... simply put she did not come across as a cold blooded killer like Arnie or Robert Patrick did. The idea of exploiting her femininity to murder is one thing, but they way it was handled is another as the ""Victoria's secret"" scene was made for 10 year olds it would seem. Why the hell would a damn near invincible ""pull over"" for a cop anyway? That really made sense... To have a unproven like Jonathan Mostow direct in Cameron's leave is just ridiculous, the guys a damned hack pure and simple if he can ruin something so good, especially trimming the film down under 2 hours like a good ""commercial"" director. For all the negativity though I will say it had SOME redeeming things going for it, the first of which is Nick Stahl. Stahl was TREMENDOUS in the movie and in many ways the glue that held it together for the first hour, unlike the terrible actor (Edward Furlong) that portrayed him in T2, he had depth and appeal. The last 30 mins are pretty good (even if the Terminator battle was eh...) and the ending gave me chills... Too bad this film was so badly soiled by its directors hand and the poor script, it could have been great 5/10 (Mainly due to Stahl's outstanding performance)",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
459,exterminator_99,Arnie's last stand,6,26 November 2004,"Following James Cameron's original in this series, few could have projected Arnold Schwarzenegger's rise to Hollywood legend. The first film was a low-budget, B-grade (in theme and style only; the story was superb) sci-fi actioner. Arnie may have gone on to star in ill-advised yet somewhat bearable comedies, and the budget for ""T2: Judgment Day"" may have been among the biggest at the time, but at heart, Arnie was always a B-grade action movie actor. Films like ""Raw Deal"", ""Total Recall"", ""Commando"" and ""Predator"" reinforce his B-grade credentials. And as the final film in his career, ""Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines"" is the fitting B-grade send-off for the most popular action star of the last twenty years.Fans will be familiar enough with the story; a cyborg is sent back through time from a post-apocalyptic future where man fights machines for his very existence. The cyborg's mission is to destroy, or terminate, the leader of the human resistance, a certain John Connor. Of course, the human resistance sends back its own defence for the protection of Connor, first as a human solider to protect John's mother Sarah (Linda Hamilton) in ""The Terminator"" (1984), then as a reprogrammed Terminator that bears an exact resemblance to the original cyborg, famously played by Schwarzenegger. Now, some 12 years after ""T2"", Arnie is sent back again, this time to protect a twenty-something John Connor (played by Nick Stahl) and a woman, Catherine Brewster (Claire Danes). After the failure of Arnie's T-800 in the original film, Robert Patrick's T-1000 in ""T2"", the machines decide on sending back a female cyborg, the T-X, played by newcomer Kristanna Loken. ""Terminator 3"" starts as each other film in the series, with the two cyborgs entering earth nude and seeking out appropriate clothing. Thereafter it's a hunt to find Connor and Brewster first, and many cars, buildings and people are destroyed in the process. A stunning action set-piece, and without question the action highlight of the film, involves a crane on a truck driven by the T-X disecting a row of shops, all the time with the T-800 hanging on for dear life. This is the part of the film where the action transcends its B-movie confines. Generally however, the film sticks to being B-grade. What makes it B-grade? It's the lack of grandiosity, the almost claustrophobic nature of the sets, the lack of a huge cast and the cheap(ish) special effects. This is not a James Cameron movie, and although director Jonathan Mostow tries hard, he lacks that grand canvas approach that has made Cameron's films so successful.While the story may be familiar, it takes a turn when we discover that Brewster's father is the man responsible for the managing of Skynet, the computer programme that subsequently launches attacks against man. This subplot is the best narrative transition from the first two films, which essentially were exactly the same. In fact, the subplot itself delivers a surprising and highly effective twist at the conclusion of the film. You can't help but think that this would have been the best way to end ""T2"", rather than the schmoltzy goodbyes between the Terminator and John Connor (then played by Edward Furlong).Furlong's absence from this film, while not perfect for continuity reasons, is not a major factor. Stahl plays Connor with immediacy and power and while he cannot always project the mood of a man with the world's future on his shoulders, he does work well with Schwarzenegger and Danes. She herself is really only working on autopilot, and although she shows occasional signs of depth, the role, or moreso the sci-fi nature of the plot seems to escape her. Loken is suitably wooden as the emotionless T-X, and lacks the weasel-like menace of Robert Patrick's T-1000. Her battles with Arnie are impressive however. And then there's Arnie himself. He's always been great at non-emotive, physical acting, and he once again performs well here. The Austrian accent seems thicker than ever, and although he moves a little slower, he still projects power and strength. His whole career was built on films that emphasised his physical presence, filling the screen with his muscles and big aura. But every action hero's career comes to an end. In a fitting epitaph to his career, the Terminator speaks of being an obsolete model, without any purpose. Just as well Arnie ended his career here, with a role and film that symbolised Arnold Schwarzenegger the actor perfectly.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
460,carlabrams,Comments about Nick Stahl as John Connor,8,6 January 2004,"I've read some of the comments here about how Nick Stahl just didn't work for people as John Connor.  I just rewatched the movie again on DVD and I think I've figured it out.  They tuned out the characters.Think about what kind of life John Connor had to have while growing up - his Mom is in an insane asylum until he's 10/13.  So he's part of the foster care system.  Then all of a sudden he finds out all the BS that he's heard about himself is true - and it's all with a vengeance.  It's not like these activities take place over months - it's a couple of days for everything from T2 and that's it.  Then he lives with him Mom in Mexico until she dies.Now he's alone - ALL alone.  What kind of life would YOU make for yourself? 17 - you've watched your Mom die from leukemia (which is not a great thing to see in and of itself) - and you're told that when most of humanity is killed in a nuclear holocaust, that you're the leader of the survivors. Think that YOU might be a little bent out of shape and quite possibly not strong enough to take it?  Maybe even crawl into a bottle, or just run away from everything?That's what John did - as is shown at the start of the movie.  By the time he's hooked up with Arnold in the crypt, he's sick of it.  From his perspective, this is an intense amount of pressure to put on someone.  You HAVE to live, no matter what.  That's why at the end of the movie Kate Brewster (who has also had a REALLY rotten 13 hours, when you think about it - she shows up at the vet clinic at 0530 for what she thinks is a routine, albeit annoying emergency call, and by 1820 hours, she's been beat up, kidnapped, shot at, her fiance is dead, her father is dead, and told she's going to be the wife of John Connor and oh, yeah, she's the one who sent Arnie back in time because John is dead in the future - that's one HELL of a day) and John Connor have grown so much in character from the start of the movie.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
461,bkam,There have been worse sequels,6,12 July 2003,"Small spoilers follow; I describe a few scenes but don't give much away. While I'm not exactly an authority on the first two films, I recall well enough what happens in those, and this one makes a good follow up.  Despite this film's somewhat wandering plot and cliché cliffhanger of an ending, it is pretty enjoyable.  The acting is not spectacular, but two of the four central characters are supposed to be robots, so what do you expect?  The camerawork is often interesting, and the film has quite a few humorous moments.  The action is great (but not incredible) throughout.  The chase, while obviously enormously expensive, had sort of a breakneck speed.  While I'm aware that this is the nature of car chases, the pace of the cutting removed my ability to focus on the action and get a real sense of suspense (see the motorcycle/truck chase of the second).  Much of the movie is at least somewhat gripping, though, and I found myself wanting to know what will happen next more often than waiting for the standard fare to play itself out.  The premise with its innumerable incarnations still manages to support the film without seeming too stale. I think most will agree that the one-on-one duel between the machines is quite a spectacle.  Overall, solid action and worth seeing.  [6/10]",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
462,MC ReXX,Absolutely awesome movie! But...,7,2 July 2003,"Just came back from seeing Terminator 3 and I must say, this movie was fantastic. Great action, great story, great intensity, great acting and great ending. This movie is a must see and definitely worth the price of admission (or even if you're over charged). It definitely felt like a different Terminator movie. Overall very well done.BUT. It was not as good as Terminator 2. The movie lacked a few things to make me say it was one of the best movies ever (as T2 is my favorite movie of all time). The biggest item it was missing was the depth of Terminator 1 and 2. It was missing a soul. The movie seemed REALLY fast, the first 30 minutes were paced very well and then it was sent into overdrive from there. Arnold's character of the T-101 was good, but come on, way too many funny lines and he's not as ruthless as he should be!  My biggest complaint though is the music. PLEASE BRING BACK BRAD FIEDEL, I BEG YOU! Marco Beltrami's score, FLAT OUT SUCKED or WAS NON-EXISTENT! Who hired this goof?! The movie could have been EVEN BETTER if the score was good!Mostow, you did a good job, but seriously you have to pace a movie a little better instead of one big rush like most of your movies are.The car/crane chase was absolutely amazing... WOW. Bathroom fight was nuts. But I have to say the graveyard shoot out was WAY TOO SHORT.Yes, it does seem like there are more cons then pros, but trust me, this is a great film and definitely worth the watch. If there is a Terminator 4, I can't wait for it.Final Rating: 9/10Again, PLEASE BRING BACK BRAD FIEDEL, I'M BEGGING YOU! I'M ON MY KNEES HERE!",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
463,meghal,Nice movie,8,14 July 2003,"It is an enjoyable movie, if you are expecting some action, and ready to letgo any inconsistencies or loopholes. There are many instances, where T3 could have killed John Connor with her weapon. But just by director's grace, she changes her mind. Also, it is impossible to believe, that machines with so advanced features cannot track down a single person, or can have X-Ray vision, as to track down John Connor when he was locked inside a cage.The picture does not appeal emotionally. The whole scene of Sarah Connor in mental asylum was quite touching one. Even chemistry between Arnold and John Connor was interesting in T2. However, here, as in the case with ""The Matrix Reloaded"", emphasis is more on technical wizardary rather than emotions. The relation between Arnold and John Connor is taken as granted. It seems as if there is no emotional bonding between them.But still the movie is worth watching once. Too bad, it does not have a repeat value",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
464,danthemovieman,"He's ""back""",9,5 July 2003,"Arnold Schwarzeneggar's back and couldn't be better in ""Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines"". In this 3rd edition of ""The Terminator"", Arnold, the good cyborg, is sent back again to protect the future savior of humanity John Conner (Nick Stahl) from a female terminator who is much more advanced than Arnold (and yes, the liquid metal stuff is back) In this movie, it starts out differently. John Conner tells us of what we've missed of his life for the past few years. He's the same guy, still messed up. He has no one, just himself, and he works odd jobs and never gets settled down in one place, he is on the run constantly. Also in this movie, it's not Arnold who arrives to the present first, its the Terminatrix, the female terminator, who arrives first in the present day. She does not know who she has to kill yet, but she has a few possible suspects, and she starts to go on a rampage, killing two innocent people, before discovering who her target is.   People won't be amazed by the special effects, we've seen them before (""Terminator 2: Judgement Day"") and they haven't really changed. However, this is the most destruction in a movie I have ever seen, Lots of explosians, and a good movie debut by Kristanna Loken, who plays the female terminator. Lots of humor, explosians, destruction, good acting, and nice direction make this movie into the perfect summer sequel that should be a box office smash!         ***1/2 out of ****",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

Hopefully this will be the last of this series, since it is unlikely that any improvement will occur in any future sequels.

468,maccaveili,Liked it better when it was called T-2,2,12 July 2003,"This movie blew chunks, wanna know why?  Cause until the very end, it was practically identical to T-2.  The chase scene was nothing but destructive, other than alot of buildings and vehicles getting demolished it was ho hum.....I wasn't sitting on the edge of my seat or anything.  Basically, a more sophisticated terminator, T-X, comes from the future to kill people, namely John Connor and his future wife.  Arnold, comes back as the ""has been"" terminator (same model as in the other 2 movies) to try to stop the ""faster, stronger, more advanced T-X"".  Ooooooh the drama.....wait this sounds familiar.  The only difference was that this time the ""bad"" terminator was a female. Haven't we seen this plot line already in T-2???Let me just say that I loved the original Terminator, and I really thought that T-2 was ahead of its time back in the day, and I enjoyed it almost as much as the 1st one because of that.  But Cameron directed those two, not the 3rd one.  These guys look like they couldn't come up with a new way of filming, so just followed the same basic principles that T-2 had.  Trust me when I say that if you've seen T-2, then you've seen T-3 already. 
*******************Spoilers*********************The only difference is that in T-2, judgement day was averted, in this one judgement still happened, basically nukes were set off all around the world thanks to the machines.  So while judgement day was avoided in T-2, it is learned in this movie that judgement day was only postponed.  I swear that is the only ""new"" idea in T-3 that they used.  It ""could"" have been really cool had the nukes gone off in say the middle of the movie and then we got to see John Connor and his mate still trying to survive the aftermath with a terminator after them....but no.  They didn't even show the nukes going off!!!!  All they did was in the final 2 minutes of the movie, show some mickey mouse grid with lines going across it representing the path of all the nukes so you could get a sense of just how many were set off. Great job Hollywood.  The best aspect of the movie that you could have used, you decided to not even show.  Basically, it boils down to this.  The future of the humans comes down to the hands of John Connor and his future wife.  After 2 failed attempts to kill Connor in the first two movies, they try again.  Like the 2nd movie, Arnold is sent back from the future to stop the more advanced T-X before she kills her targets.  Like the 2nd movie, it is a ""struggle"" and she is always right behind them just ""ever so close"" but yet not ever close enough to finish the job.  By the end of the movie, just as they ""want"" you to think that the T-X is about to kill her targets (ya as if), Arnold, our hero, saves the day.  Oh ya, and he spouts out yet another dumb one liner like ""you are terminated"" to the other terminator.  There was one part where the T-X, who can control machines, got to Arnold and was controlling him against Connor and his future wife.  This could have been a cool twist, like a blast from the past from Terminator the original, but no.  This only lasted like a minute or two as Arnold shut himself down so he wouldn't ""fail"" his mission.  So there went that little twist, yet another missed opportunity to make this movie unique. 
God I hope they don't release a 4th one because this is starting to get as predictable as the ""Rocky"" series.  There were attempts at humor in this movie, but they were ""few and far between"" and not very funny even when you saw them.  Anyone who pays to see this movie once can be forgiven, but if you pay to see it twice, then you should seek a CAT scan to see what is wrong with your head.

469,stamp1,This Movie Was Perfect-Ignore ANY NEGATIVE Reviews!!!,10,6 July 2003,"This was probably the best movie ever made! Period. Maybe better than Finding Nemo, or The Lord Of The Rings movies. Definitely better than the Matrix movies. It was a 15 out of 10 rating-wise. It had non-stop action for 2 hours. (No boring philosophy discussions for 20 minutes at a time to slow the movie down.) It was hilarious!! Lots of funny one-liners and sight gags, Arnold is getting better as a comedian. The Special Effects were unbelievable! The BEST EVER!!! The best vehicle chase scene in a year filled with movies full of chase scenes!! (The chase scenes in this movie were BETTER than the one in the Matrix 2 Reloaded, better than ones in 2 Fast 2 Furious, The Recruit, or even Cradle 2 The Grave. Or The Bourne Identity from last year.) The newest female terminatrix was the best ever, even Arnold (an emotionless robot) seemed to fear her, because she was undefeatable it seemed. (You'll have to see the movie to find out if she was ever defeated!!). The movie had lots of scary parts where we think the good guys will die, and the evil bitchy terminatrix will destroy everyone. (I loved how Arnold converted their car into a convertible topless car.)So there you have it: Non-stop action, greatest FX ever, greatest vehicles chase scenes ever, funniest action film of all time, Arnold in his finest film role ever, perfect script, scary, EXCITING, a SURPRISE ENDING!!, great evil parts, and the ending was not totally happy, but it was sort of a downer, but still there was hope (for the world, and for another sequel too!) The most PERFECT movie ever made. But after watching this movie I am afraid of the internet!!!I could not think of any way this movie could have been improved, EXCEPT if it had free admission!! I thought the most hilarious line was Arnold's ""Talk to the hand!"" You'll have to see the movie to understand why this line IS SO FUNNY!!!!!!!!!!!!",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
470,crawfrordboon,Two thumbs up!,7,9 November 2003,"I entered the cinema for this one very excited at the prospect of the third Terminator film and the first for twelve years. This was Arnold's chance to put his movie career back on track after the near-misses of the last five years or so. I was also rather nervous - I am a big fan of Mr Schwarzenegger, and if the California governership rumours were true (and of course they were), this could well be his last chance to make a huge impact to rival that of Terminator 2. I truly wanted him to succeed, and for the film to be a huge hit. Thankfully I wasn't dissapointed.

When I left that same cinema two and a half hours later (i had entered for the trailers too), I felt a little confused about what I had seen, how good a film it was in itself, and how it rated compared with T1 and T2. One thing though was certain - Arnold was back in a big way and this is his best since True Lies, of which it is a fair equal. The big man himself didn't let himself down with an eye-catching performance, especially as he thrashed the evil T-X around, breaking everything in sight!My main problems with the film were:* there is no ending, simply a ""tune into to T4 to find out what happens. This was a shame as both previous films enjoyed a ravishing and conclusive finale.* Arnold's character is not given enough screen time, and too often he is making jokes and comic lines instead of dialogue that sets him up as a believable cyborg. After all, this T-101 should be exactly the same as the T-800 at the start of Terminator 2, with the same fearsome qualities and mechanic responses. Unless he was reprogrammed by John Connor before he was sent back in time, but that doesn't explain why he didn't reprogram the T-101 from T2 on similar lines. Unless he wanted to give his former self a chance to learn what is needed to be done in the future, a kind of self-fulfilling prophecy.* It feels like a remake of T2. There's not much elaboration on the plot, other than John Connor being a depressed itinerant junkie, and the introduction of Kate Brewster. Sarah Connor is dead, but i half expected that, her character came full circle at the end of T2 when she shakes hand with the T101. Also the relationship between the Terminator and John Connor is ambiguous most of the time, John is mostly over familiar with it.* The introduction of Kate Brewster, and of her past involvement in the plot of T2, the 'destiny' John talks about, is unwarranted. This messes with a previously perfect film (T2). Also the whole thing of Kate being John's future wife, and of him being killed by the Terminator before Kate sends it back, is uneccessary. You're making T4, why not leave all that until then, where it belongs. Here it just feels goofy. Plus the Terminator should know better than to inform people of their own future, John should have programmed it into him. As any fan of Back to the Future should know!* The T-X, played by Kristanna Loken, just isn't scary. She hasn't got the physical presence to match up with Arnold Schwarzengger, and the use of weaponry rang false to me - why does it need weapons to beat a machine which it is supposedlly far in advance of? She should have been made more menacing, for example the child murder scenes should have been more graphic and disturbing, giving us an idea of the TX's capabilities.* Whenever either the T-X appears to menace the mortal main characters, along comes the T-101 to save them, despite a lot of running around that in my view really wasn't necessary. Plus, with all those prototype robotic terminators, and the ability of the TX to control mechanic things, it really should have been a piece of cake for it to wipte out John and Kate. Feels less plausible than the first two.Apart from these few minor gripes though, I enjoyed the film. Arnold is once again at the top of the action tree, and is well supported by Nick Stahl and Clare Danes, though neither had too much to do in their roles, playing more human characters, with few memorable characteristics. Linda Hamilton is gone, and Kate Brewster character goes from being an innocent vetinary worker to a dead eye Terminator-killing sharpshooter without any discernible character changes in between. She just picks up an AK47 and off she goes.
I'm letting the negatives get in the way here, but what I should say is that this has the look and feel of a major action blockbuster, and whilst its not up there with the first two in the series, its light years ahead of the crap we seem to get in cinemas these days. Especially good was the extended car chase that had a 1980s feel, and the 'coffin sequence,' a pure genius scene that I will never forget.All in all, the best film of the year, and on this evidence, if things don't work out for Arnold in Sacramento, he'll be welcome back for the finale of this franchise any day!",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
471,siebertws13,Most Unnecessary Sequel Ever,1,22 August 2015,"What a waste of time and space, a true turd after the diamonds of Terminator and Terminator 2: Judgement Day. This is the worst kind of sequel, in that it kinda poisons the memory of the films that came before it a little bit, negating the perfection they left in their complimentary tales. But there's more bad than that. Nick Stahl registers zero as John Conner, and Claire Danes is miscast in a thankless role to begin with. Arnold is back in the groove, but it's schtick by this point because the script feels so desperate and forced as it tries to take the franchise in a new direction. The ending is just sour and rotten and corruptive of the mythology that was nicely tied up by the films before it. T3: No fun, no smarts, no good. This is Hollywood at its worst: Milking a franchise that should've logically stopped at sequel in order to generate a few more hundred millions.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
472,aplato,Exciting addition to the Terminator franchise,8,19 July 2003,"I'll admit I went into this movie with modest expectations. I anticipated a shoot-em-up action flick. And I was not disappointed in any way. The action in this movie is very good. The sounds and sights are awe inspiring in some scenes. What really got me in this movie was the ending. I won't give away any details, but I was pleasantly suprised by a very non-Hollywood ending. Admitiedly, the climax of the movie was a little tepid, but what happens after that was kind of suprising. It was not entirely positive. However, Terminator movies have always had somewhat melencholy endings. In T1, we had to watch Kyle die. And in T2, the Terminator gets lowered into lava. This movie has a similar sad point, but its a different kind of sad point. It does however, fit with the movie, making it seem that much more real.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

But T3 really exceeded my expectations, I was surprised that they actually made a movie worthy of the Terminator name, especially since it's directed by Jonathan Mostow (anyone see U-571?).The movie provides a satisfying completion to the story, yet it still leaves it open for more. I liked Nick Stahl's John Connor better than Edward Furlong, but Kristanna Loken's Terminator wasn't half as menacing or as cool as Robert Patrick's was. I enjoyed it more than T1, but it's still not quite as good as T2. Overall I give it ***1/2 out of four stars.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

475,sdillon-1,Surprisingly enjoyable.,6,4 August 2003,"The Terminator and Terminator 2:Judgment Day are, respectively, a science fiction classic, and a worthy sequel to a science fiction classic.  They are both brilliantly written and directed by James Cameron, the finest action director in the world.  As well as being excellent action-packed stories, they have great emotional impact and contain an interesting message about the value of human life.  They also manage to be simultaneously pessimistic and optimistic as the heroes of the story struggle to prevent a future apocalypse.  Whether or not they succeed is left brilliantly ambiguous. 
The close of Terminator 2 seemed like a fantastic ending.  Continuing it, I always thought would be a truly terrible idea, especially with James Cameron not at the helm.  Therefore, Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines sounded like a cynical exercise in revitalising Arnold Schwarzenegger's flagging career. Unlike the first two films, it has not been made for any artistic or creative reason.It comes as a great surprise then, that Terminator 3 is actually rather enjoyable.  It's nowhere near as good as its illustrious predecessors, but its certainly more entertaining than, say, The Matrix Reloaded.  Although director Jonathan Mostow lack's Cameron's flair, he's always solid and delivers some fine action set pieces.  Unfortunately, that's all he does deliver.  Terminator 3 is full of action, but it has precious little character development and lacks the emotional core of the earlier films. That is, until the last five minutes of the film which I won't spoil here.The plot is the same as ever, with Arnold Schwarzenegger's T-800 terminator once more sent back in time to protect John Conner (Nick Stahl) from yet another terminator upgrade, the female T-X (Kristanna Loken).  The T-X is a kind of cross between the liquid metal terminator of Terminator 2 and Arnie's mechanical version.  However, this time it has other targets beside Conner, including his wife-to-be Kathryn Brewster (Claire Danes).  It transpires the nuclear war Conner thought had been prevented in Terminator 2 has only been `postponed' (completely destroying the logic of previous instalments).  This leads to a race against time, which fails to be anywhere near as suspenseful as it should be.The cast are all good, if unremarkable.  However, the script has an annoying habit of delivering the signature dialogue with a nod and a wink.  Lines like `Come with me if you want to live' and `I'll be back' no longer have the resonance they had in the earlier films, and simply become irritating. As for Arnie, he's good, but no longer has the edge he had in the earlier films.  I doubt this film will resurrect his career.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
476,dhallen,"Very disappointing film, breaks no new ground.",5,20 August 2004,"From the first few seconds of the film, T3 trod the same old ground. Starting with the T's arriving in the ""burning bubbles"" and continuing on through the overly-long car chases until the dreary ending, this film was almost a clip show of scenes from T2. Worse yet, parts of it were even a parody of the earlier films...for example, the Elton-Johnesque sunglasses Arnold ""borrows"" from the male stripper. I was bored and dissatisfied with this movie and it came very close to besmirching the memory of the much better earlier films. The female T3 was predictable, and not nearly the shocker it was supposed to be. I think they should have tried an entirely new direction with this movie, but it falls flat and I rank it completely out of the same league as T2.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

Jonathan Mostow (yes, he is a lot better than the 'king of the world') is a god, he made a better Terminator film, than James Cameron ever made. This movie is a lot better than the first two: better script, better music, better actors (except Arnold, he is good again:) and better directing. Cameron (Hey, you! Go to the cinema and go to practice from Mostow!) fans will do not like this movie, but who cares... It was really good to wait 12 years for this fantastic movie!!!

The TX robot from the back seat shoves her arm through the driver of the car, impaling the poor guy, in order to steer the car. I'd say the shock value of the other two pictures were still present.I actually enjoyed the films, they're all about the same to me. Cameron gets the props for coming up with the story but the new director and cast didn't do a bad job for the third installment. I view these films in the same manner as Jurassic Park, which is loud, action filled popcorn escape films where for some reason you enjoy seeing people getting eaten or eating the other end of a shotgun barrel. Its just good old fashioned summer time violence. Ahhhhh.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
479,Treeman222,Best movie of the summer so far,8,5 July 2003,"Having seen The Matrix, X2, and the Hulk, I can honestly say that I liked T3 the best of all of them. Lots of action, humor and a good story that doesn't feel contrived.That being said, how does it stack up to T1 and T2? It's hard to say. The first two films definitley have a different look and feel to them. This one seemed more flatly shot and less atmospheric. T2 was such a mind-blowing surprise when it came out that everything before it was blown out of the water, and it has become the benchmark for everything since. Because there are so few surprises left for movies to offer, this doesn't give you that sense of awe, like you're seeing something for the first time.
It does, however, give you old school action by the bucketload. Cars, buildings and bathroom stalls (you'll see) explode with such reckless abandon that you can't help but enjoy it. And just when it begins to become too much - the story takes a twist and sucks you in. Also, Arnold looks better than he has in years and its great to see him back in his signature role.Some have said the ending is a letdown. I disagree. Though it may be understated, I think it's the best ending of a movie in a very long time. It doesn't cop out, and leaves you wanting more.Overall, very entertaining. Arnold's best since the last one.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
480,selenedm999,better than average but doesn't live up to its name **spoilers**,5,13 March 2007,"**possible spoilers contained** Terminator 3 was roundly slammed by critics and fans alike, but having waited 12 years for it, I was prepared to enjoy it no matter what, and was actually pleased with the results.It's been 10 years since the events of Terminator 2 and John Connor has managed to avoid any traceable records, living ""off the grid."" When the new Terminator, a femme fatale played by Kristanna Loken arrives and kills off some of his schoolmates, it's up to JC (get it?) to save humanity, with the help of Good-Guy Terminator Arnie, and Claire Danes as former girlfriend/future wife. Violent Oedipal imagery abounds, when we find out the empty ""womb""/tomb of his mother, MIA Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton), contains some heavy artillery. The film, which is basically a chase movie like the first two, ends on a down note. Where T-1 and T-2 were hopeful about the fate of humans, the final installment lets us know that we'll all be responsible for our destruction.While not nearly up to the standards of special effects and intelligent narrative set by the first two movies, T-3 was a cut above most bonehead action flicks, and it still manages to make the audience think. It certainly missed both James Cameron and Linda Hamilton (whose ignoble death was not befitting the mother/Amazon we loved from T-2: ""There are 206 bones in the human body. That was one.""). I'll continue to love the series, because it's compelling and smart without losing the action, and I look forward to the next one. I'll bet Arnie won't be required, since digital imagery has come a long way. We'll see.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
481,Vinny-28,B-Movie with Some Third Act Ambition,6,1 July 2003,"Okay, let's face it:  Most of this film is a retread of the basic beats from Terminator 2.  But the truth is that Terminator 2 was basically a retread of the first Terminator, right down to its ""here's another truck over-turning"" third act.  What Terminator 2 had going for it was the raw power and surprise of a pumped up Linda Hamilton; plus the new CGI morphing effects that brought the T-1000 to life; and the fresh twist that Arnold was now the ""good guy.""  Still, at the end of the second film, we basically were back where we started, with the nuclear armaggedon again supposedly stopped.  It lacked real scope.  Terminator 3 finally takes us somewhere new in its final minutes, and this is what really elevates an okay action retread a bit higher making it a worthy sequel--especially if it means we finally get to the good stuff in the fourth film.  Mostow is a bit of a journeyman, without much grace or artistry.  The female T-X makes less of an impression than one would've hoped.  But in its final few minutes, it does what most sci-fi films unfortunately never do:  Makes you wonder how in the hell it will end.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

485,soanim8ed,"Fun, but...",8,10 July 2003,"A Terminator movie without James Cameron?  How could they?  Easily, it seems. Terminator 3: Rise Of The Machines takes place ten years after Terminator 2: Judgment Day.  John Connor is in his early twenties and has been hiding and running since he and his mother stopped Judgment Day from happening.      As it turns out Judgment Day is inevitable and the machines go back in time again kill off not only John Connor, but his lieutenants as well.  Enter Arnold again who is sent back to protect not only Connor but Kate Brewster (played by Claire Danes).   In the midst of this is a new Terminator unit T-X or as Connor calls her at one point, Terminatrix.  She is a sleek, super-model killer and virtually unstoppable. In their attempt to escape, they outrun the T-X in a vet truck in one of the most destructive car chases put on film.      It's all very exciting and fun with a slight human element that doesn't go as deep as T2 went, but they try.  Claire Danes and Nick Stahl (Connor) don't really have too much chemistry between them; however, Arnold does with his deep-pan delivery and his new psychology sub-routine, which leads to the most humorous moments in the film.    Jonathan Mostow had some big shoes to step into taking on this directing project and he does a bang-up job (pun intended).  He has captured the feeling of excitement and loss that is in the first two of knowing the world is coming to an end, but frankly without Linda Hamilton's strong female character, this film lacks some of the spunk that made T1 and T2 great.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

In T2 the T1000 is clearly superior to Arnold and the hero's spend most of the movie running from it, rightly so, and Arnold gets his nads handed to him every time they meet.
However in this movie Arnold should be even more inferior to the TX, but he is constantly on the offensive, attacking her aggressively and beating her without too much trouble on every occasion. I never felt like Arnold was in any peril at the hands of the TX, all she seemed able to do was hit him with cars and ram his head into walls.Bottom line, the T1000 in T2 was a million times more dangerous, the TX is just another lame robot.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

I was stunned to find out how good it was. The attraction of the Terminator films has never been in the excellence of their FX, but in the brilliance of their time-turning plot twists (which we could discuss for DAYS). Based on that criteria, I think this is almost as good as the original, and far superior to the FX-laden but plot-challenged T2. The ending is incredibly, and suitably, fatalistic.

The first time I hated it - thought it was a cheap rip off - stealing scenes and lines from the original two movies. The second time I saw it I was starting to warm towards it and took the scene and line stealing as what I am sure it was intended, a homage to the first movies.The action scenes were fairly good - Arnie could still cut it reasonably well as the terminator despite his age. The new terminator resembled the characteristics (the mannerisms not the physicality) of the T-1000 (Robert Patric) from T2 and this sorts of fits with the whole improved terminator line, i.e. less robotic more human. There were some glaring holes which although I tried hard I could not ignoreSpoiler possibility (I will keep as vague as possible) The secret base was stunningly unguarded, in fact most of the military establishments appear to have an open door policy for strangers :-)I won't go into anymore but there are someOne of the things I did not like at all was the development of the John Connor character. This I feel betrayed the first 2 movies. In the first movie, Sarah Connor starts off weak and becomes strong. In the second movie, John Connor starts off strong and gets stronger. In the third movie John Connor appears to have had a personality change. He seems like a frightened and confused child - not at all like the strong willed resourceful character from the second film. This grated on me a bit as he seemed very whiny and weak in this movie.The  ending was reasonably good - covering the ""The future is not fixed"" sort of scenario and therefore allowing the rules to be broken from one movie to the next in a reasonably sensible way (As sensible as you can get with time travel movies).Summary Direction - nice and fast paced - all you would expect from a T2 movie.

My only critisism of the film is the significantly increased use of humour, this is out of place in a terminator film. However, the rest was good (although the script could have been better), the action was relentless (particlualy the crane scene) and the actors all did a fine job, of particular interest is the end, which is excellent. this is much better than X men 2, Hulk, Matrix reloaded, best film of 2003!!!",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

This contrived piece of crap is nothing more than a standard action flick.  Arnold delivered comedic line after comedic line after comedic line.  That might not have been so offensive if this was Commando II.  However, for a Terminator film, it's insulting to its legacy.  The absence of Cameron and Hamilton is noticeable, and Stahl and Daines (who appears to be 35 now) are unconvincing, at best.  Arnold attempts to carry the movie with standard action stunts and one liners, but there's no meat to this sandwich, folks.  The story is lame, and the characters are worse. The ending isn't a surprise to anyone familiar with the scifi genre, wherein surprise ""unhappy endings"" abound.  If you can, avoid it at all costs.

T2 for me was - as I'm sure it was for many others - one of the definitive sci-fi films of the Nineties. And yes there are plot-holes and discrepancies you could drive a crane through but I think you geeky chaps should worry less about those and get out and play with some real people a bit more.Ignore the knockers - enjoy the mayhem, sexy killer-robo-babe and Arnies' one liners and make your own mind up.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
496,grintemcstinger,"How many times does he intent to say ""...back.""?",6,13 August 2015,"Terminator 3, what can I say... It's probably one of the most difficult movies to have humble expectations first time around after seeing the previous movies of the franchise. How can you not expect it to be great as the prequels were - this is The Terminator we're talking about, right? Right?Ever since seeing Terminator 2 I always wondered if there would be another entry. How would they follow it up and possibly top them? As time passed there were various rumors here and there, but never anything concrete for a long time. James Cameron was involved, then he was not and so on and so forth. There were comics that I found to be quite interesting and served as tie-ins to both T1 and T2, in which you would for example see where the T1000 got his look from and what happened in the future war with its own twists and turns of events. I found it to be solid material that could be used for reference when making a third movie. After all, the future where the war with Skynet is happening and both Kyle Reese and the terminators are send back in time is the least covered part in the previous movies, and at one point did happen either way, wherever it was avoided in T2 or not. So to me it was the only logical way a third one would've been made, if at all, and it sort of would be both a prequel and sequel.Then, after a too long time when the hype kinda laid down, Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines came along, and right of the bat it looked like they didn't have any new ideas. Even from the trailer I could tell that they were playing it safe and pretty much rehashed the second one. Watching the movie for the fist time was like playing the waiting game, when would something wow me? We're still stuck with the same, old characters that are supposed to be humanity saviors only this time completely without any notable development towards it. And when the end-credits rolled I was left unimpressed and thought to myself ""well, that's just a so much weaker version of T2"". It didn't do anything new, at all. At that time I couldn't even point out a single thing that stood out to me. It was just one giant ""meh"". Thrill and fear - completely gone. Creativity - huh, what!? Character development, emotions, purpose - not much here. Moving and powerful music - absent. Fear inducing and horrifying villain - nope, you just get this sort of T1000 with T800 parts and gimmicks tacked on that's here just for the action. No message, no meaningful conflict, no nightmares, no deeper meaning, nada, niente.Instead of everything mentioned you get: good action with some notable scenes and enough oomph. Campy humor that is often too much on the nose and more than once feels like a spoof of the second movie, almost reaching Scary Movie-like levels in some scenes. And a overabundance of the same one-liners now with slight variations. Seriously, people loved them in T2, but that wasn't by far the main thing. It was rather the cherry on top and way better implemented in small amounts and way more natural. Here it seemed that everything happening is for the purpose of forcing as much as possible of them down your throat and blowing sh*t up for the sake of blowing sh*t up. It's like they misunderstood or didn't bother to understand the appeal of the Terminator movies and just went with the f-yeah action.But after watching it a few more times I came to appreciate it for what it is. Had it been completely unrelated to the Terminator saga it would be much easier to enjoy it and pass it as a decent popcorn action flick. The main problems are the truly giant steps it has to fill in and the pressure while making it must've been immense. Jonathan Mostov actually does a fairly competent, sans the humorous parts, job and at certain times it does feel slightly like a Terminator movie. Its the writing that is just so incredibly lazy. Maybe it was indeed the smarter move in playing it safe as the perfection the previous movies achieved is truly something that does happen very rarely, so it may have underwhelm either way. It's not a bad movie, but it just tremendously pales in comparison and is hindered by having to live up to two of the greatest movies of all time. The ending is solid and a good way to lead into the dark future - it fits surprisingly well into the whole saga, however anything before that was, sadly, completely unnecessary and spread thin to the movies run time.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

But they were not able to execute it in a decent way.Hey idiots, it is the rise of the machines, the end of the world... The director couldn't nail it, he fell very, very short to the challenge.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
498,Anton_Klink,From potential disaster to one of the BEST action movies ever!,8,12 July 2003,"This could easily have been a disaster. With James Cameron, Linda Hamilton, Brad Fiedel (composer) nowhere in sight for this movie and Arnie's career in the gutter for the past ten years, the whole project had a feel of ""let's try to save Arnie's career one last time"" and ""let's try to make a quick buck off the Terminator franchise"".I had serious doubts the 56-year old Arnold could still command the screen like he used to. And I had grave doubts about the idea of a female villain - with T-1000 from T2 being one of the ultimate movie villains of all time in my opinion, throwing in a woman seemed like something the movie-makers were trying to do just to be ""different"". Plus her being robotic again seemed like a step down from T2's polymorphic terminator. Nick Stahl didn't seem like an appealing choice for John Connor either. And the idea of Claire Danes seemed like an artificial drag-along in order for our hero to ""have a girlfriend"".The only sign of hope was the big budget. With an accepted budget of $170-$200 million, they HAD to make a movie which can rely on more than just the opening weekend box office. And I was relieved to find out that they DID!Of course I realize that with such low expectations, it would have been easy for the movie to exceed them. But that is hardly the case here - T3 is not only the action movie of the year, it is without a doubt one of the BEST action movies of all time. I was happy to see Arnie back on top - even if it is for just this one movie. I was happy to see the female terminator was actually a step up from T-1000. I was happy to see Nick Stahl being just PERFECT for the role. The eerie atmosphere of T1 was back and the action (especially the fighting and car-chase sequences) absolutely DECIMATED Matrix Reloaded even without having to rely on either CGI slow-motion, bullet-time photography or dangling from wires. The movie was even able to handle the usual stumbling-place of all action movies - the ending - surprisingly well.As far as action movies go - 10 out of 10.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

The plot is recycled. The characters are recycled. The whole movie is, in a word, lame. And boring. I suspect that if Ahnold hadn't been planning a run for Gov, this piece of garbage would never have been made.Perhaps someday someone will make another Terminator episode that actually advances the story while holding the audience's interest. But this movie certainly isn't it.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

Nick Stahl and Claire Danes were good, and of course Arnold Schwarzenegger was on top of his game.  But the ending didn't seem to fit.  It was like they were filming one day and the director was told he only had five minutes to wrap up filming, so he threw something together.  It's the same feeling I got at the end of Primary Colors (John Travolta as a presidential candidate who was obviously modeled after Bill Clinton).",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
501,rvnc,"No match for its predecessors, but good nonetheless.",7,16 May 2007,"In musical terms T-3 would be the 'difficult' third album, the one that perhaps didn't need to made, or was over-produced and over-hyped. Think 'Be Here Now' by British band Oasis, following in the footsteps of two hugely critically and commercially successful albums.The first two films in this franchise really set the bar high, the first a low budget cult classic, and the second an overblown but ultimately superb blockbuster action movie. But T-3 is a flawed project. First and foremost there was no James Cameron, meaning Mostow got the job instead. Coming from U-571, in which history is changed so that the Americans found the enigma machine instead. Not a good omen. With Cameron's films there is a focus and seriousness that is hugely appealing. 'The Terminator' is completely straight-edged and 'T-2' for all the one liners is serious when it needs to be. I don't get that with this film. From the moment the TX's chest expands it feels silly, at times a little gratuitous. What I liked about the original and it's sequel was how cold and efficient the Terminators were when it came to the killing. In 'T-3' the deaths are over the top and pointlessly visceral. Why would the TX choose to saw a victim to death rather than just shoot or stab them? Surely that would save valuable time and attract less attention? For me the TX is a real shame in this picture. A female Terminator could have chilling, more terrifying than Arnie or Robert Patrick. But for some reason it just doesn't work, she's just not cunning, or relentless enough. The T-1000 remains far more intimidating in my book. My other concern is with John Connor. Okay so Ed Furlong was a little annoying in 'T-2' but at least he had had some heart, a spark and an initiative. I could perceive him as a leader because he had some BALLS. Nick Stahl just doesn't have that. John Connor is too pathetic, too resigned to things to be the hero he'll turn into. I understand maybe Mostow felt he needed to explore Connor a little, but it doesn't work.It's not all bad though, in fact far from it. 'T-3' has much to commend it. As you'd expect the special effects are good, and the action is fast paced and good to watch. The chase scenes are not as good as in 'T-2' but hey, it's hard to climb Everest twice. In particular Claire Danes is great as Caroline Brewster. Her resourcefulness and spirit despite not having a clue what's going on are hugely refreshing when placed next Nick Stahl's Connor. And of course who can forget Arnie? The big man delivers enough solid display as a character it's hard not to like. Arnie also delivers maybe the best line in the series so far 'what I what is irrelevant, I am a machine!' which I think is a fantastic line.My favourite part of the movie though, is the end. No i'm not being sarcastic. The ending scene at Crystal Peak is inspired, a wonderful ending to the film. Wheras 'The Terminator' and 'T-2' needed happyish endings, 'T-3' needed the opposite. The notion that John Connor and Caroline Brewster were only meant to survive, not change the course of history is a far better concept than having them stop Skynet again. Obviously it's leading into a sequel, and it's a fine way to do it. The ending to me is the only time the whole film really captures the spirit of the original, in which survival was everything.'T-3' is a good film, but it's not a great film and as such will always suffer unfavourable comparisons. Viewed objectively at times it's very good, but it doesn't do the serious stuff as well as 'The Terminator' or the action as well as 'T-2'. As a film it's quite good, but as a sequel it ultimately doesn't stack up.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
502,johnnycage10,One of the best movies of all time,10,22 October 2003,"I'm really surprised at all the negative reviews T3 is receiving. It was as good as the previous two Terminator films, which makes this franchise the only title out there that's great, quality entertainment without any interruptions of garbage in the middle (ala Alien 3). Of the many positive aspects about this film that all the critics out there ignore because they're too busy on the Miss James Cameron bandwagon, here's some: ***********SPOILERS************From the start we definitely missed Linda Hamilton's character from T2, as she was the best (though not only) asset from that film. But Nick Stahl did as good a job as her here in taking over as the human who was caught in the middle of a battle of titans. I had a bad feeling about this actor when I first saw that Edward Furlong wasn't coming back for T3, but my doubts were quickly put down when I saw how good an actor he was, playing an incredibly well-written character. Here we have a brooding, depressed John Connor who doesn't want the role of humanity's leader, feeling that way especially after his mother died and after having watched the only friend he had, the T800 from T2, leaving him at the end of the second film. He never thought that he was good enough to carry this huge responsibility, but he also suspected that he couldn't avoid it no matter how much he just wanted to disappear off the map, thus the nightmare of a chilling army of terminators who were seen approaching the screen as a dream to him after he dropped the bottle of beer into the lake whose ground was covered with skulls. But the fact that this guy was willing to put a gun to his own head to pressure the T800 to help them try to stop Skynet was proof that he was as good as his reputation said, as no one would be more qualified to lead the humans after the apocalypse as a person who showed that much heart and backbone at that scene.Following that, we have action and special effects that are incredible to watch, surprises ala the coffin full of weapons and the fact that it was Kate who sent the T800 back instead of John being the one who did so, as well as humor like the sunglasses at the beginning and the `talk to the hand' comment as the T800 was taking food out of the store, which made the entire theater laugh where I was.As a conclusion, we have a battle between machines, but not between the T800 and the TX, as expected, but between the T800 and the earliest terminator models that the TX reprogrammed, sending them out to massacre people. So we have the early terminators killing people and the only one who's fighting back against them is the T800, machine versus machine for the lives of the human survivors who were in the compound hanging in the balance. The T800 reached a level of humanity there that it never expected to have. And that was followed with it rebelling against the reprogram it then received from the TX to kill John and Kate, which made it into a much more sympathetic character than it ever was in T1 and T2. And this rebellion within the T800 was conceivable since the TX was used to ordering neutral machines to do its bidding (ie, cars). But the T800 already had an order to protect, thus the new orders to kill were coming into conflict with the previous ones, thus leading it to prefer to shut itself off rather than go against its original orders. Whether its interaction with John and Kate had any say in its decision is something that's debatable, of course, as it was fine with being reprogrammed to save Kate after its very first orders by Skynet were to kill humans. So in the future, it accepted its second orders to protect just fine, but not its third orders in the present time to return to killing. Begs the question as to why.And lastly, there's the ending, which I'll just summarize as being one that was a jaw-dropping surprise. I won't say what it is here in case there's anyone out there who's waiting to see this film on tape or DVD, but suffice it to say that you won't see it coming and it'll leave you on the edge of your seat. With John and Kate totally exhausted and realizing that they did all they could and all there is to do now is watch their efforts unfold while waiting for the future.So when all is said and done, I can say that James Cameron can return to doing Titanic 2 or another lousy show like Dark Angel if he wants, but if he doesn't wish to participate here, he's not needed as J. Mostow is doing just great. Anyone who wants to watch garbage can see Matrix Reloaded, a movie whose only premise is making as many marketing products from the once-great Matrix title as possible. But for those who demand quality for their money, it's clear what the best movie of this year is. My only question now is, where is T4?! It's time for John Connor to take charge.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

505,*(CableGuy)*,I'll Be... Funny?,8,3 July 2003,"Given the advance word was so awful, I was relieved to find this to be an entertaining, almost jocular movie at times.  Mostow made a good choice in making this a self-referential flick that borders on near-parody at times, only to lose the levity when the drama required it.  I won't spoil the ending, but this movie has stones, that's for sure.  High art it ain't, but high entertainment it is.  Sure, it's got plot holes you could drive a giant crane chasing a giant fire truck through, but honestly, it's T3, what do you expect?  Sit back, check that film school attitude at the door, and let Governor Arnie remind you why he is who he is.And damn, Schwarzenegger looks as sculpted here as he did 20 years ago.

They were making him tell corny jokes. There shouldn't be humor like that. That's just wrong. They should have at least up graded his power and computer level. I felt like he was an old Dos machine the whole time watching it. He never even kicked ass the whole time. He was just struggling to make it, and in the end still couldn't kick ass if it wasn't for that thing in his body. He never really has kicked ass if you think about it, what the hell man! I'm thoroughly in a state of disappointment. Why did they have to make so many new things, like making him a whole other different terminator? It looses its sentimental value you lived up for watching. I disagree with so many things in this movie. It literally had no potential. I can't help but feel sad with all this. James Cameron should have done it. It is his work, not someone who's done a dumb comedy back in 89, some action movie with Kurt Russell in 97, some TV. Movie, and a very repetitive submarine movie. Why?? I just don't get all this. It's such a shame this movie had to happen in such a bad way. A lot of the action didn't even feel like part of the story.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

512,LennyRenquist,Hype terminates movies...,9,18 July 2003,"...but strangely, in the lead-up to T3, I didn't encounter ANY of the saturation advertising. I heard about it: ""Hey, have you seen the trailer for T3? That T-X looks sooooo hot!"" But somehow it passed me by. The only hype I encountered was in my own mind. And that was mostly concern that it might suck. I was afraid Arnie might be past it. I was afraid the lack of Cameron panache might result in a lame sequel, rather than a great new instalment in a great series. But then I thought: That T-X looks sooooo hot! So I went to see it.And I'm glad I did. This is no epic like T2. But it's definitely a worthy addition to the franchise. It's more reminiscent of T1, in that it's like a low-budget, B-grade sci-fi actioner. With a bit of a brain. And a HUGE budget. My kind of movie.To my mind, the biggest (well, only) flaw with T2 was that Jim unwittingly created a sort of paradox. To wit: No Cyberdyne = No Skynet = No War = No Terminator = No Kyle Reece Time Travel Caper = No John Connor = No End To Cyberdyne = Skynet = War = Machines Win. Oops.T3, in explaining its premise (or justifying its existence) sort of solves this paradox. But in so doing, it creates a new one, concerning John's message to his mother in T1, the philosophy which becomes her driving force in T2. Maybe he was just being cheeky, seeing what crazy things his words might make her do. But then, maybe not.On top of introducing a new philosophical slant to proceedings, the folks behind T3 have expanded the story and introduced new characters, while keeping the cast quite small.The action sequences are AWESOME. One chase, involving a crane, a fire engine and several police cars, is one of the most spectacular (not to mention EXPENSIVE-LOOKING) I have seen in recent times. Mostly because there appear to be few visual effects involved. Not to mention HEAPS of wrecked cars.Arnie may be getting on, but he is still the Terminator. His skin may sag a little, but he's an old model. Surely Terminators get wrinkles. No-one else can punch through a wall like Arnie.Nick Stahl is fine as an older John Connor. I like the way the character is introduced. A lot has happened to him since he helped stop Judgement Day. And he's the worse for it. He starts out a little frazzled, then gets MORE frazzled as the situation escalates. Nick portrays this well.I have to admit, I had reservations about Claire Danes being in this movie, as it's not in keeping with her usual...thing. But she's playing a character who isn't used to being hunted by an evil robot (who is?), so it works out nicely. She plays frightened well.And Kristanna Loken? What can I say? You can keep your Xenia Onatopp and your Mystique. There's a new femme fatale in town. And she's a toughie, too. She has a grenade launcher in her hand! Literally! She can throw ARNIE around the room like a RAGDOLL! How can you beat that? The T-X is a clever combination of the solid T-101 (Arnie) and the liquid T-1000 (Robert Patrick). With boobs. Sheer genius.I went in expecting a lame action movie about an old man in leather. What I got was a surprisingly good (REALLY good) Terminator movie, that left me wanting a T4.Is it inevitable?

I was totally disappointed and deceived, not to mention that I felt very sick. I had an heartache and I was hurt deeply, cause that nipple-face who is Jonathan Mostow completely ruined the Terminator series with this awful heap of metal scrap. I had convulsions, the strange impression that I lost my balls, my eyes and my head, and even worse: I touched my head to assure that all my hair didn't fall...In this movie, the dialogs are more funny and artificial than the usual, and this time, the actors did a really sickening job. But the most ridiculous ever, it's the Terminatrix when she inflates her breast in the car. Also, we didn't need a sequel, cause in the 2nd movie, Skynet was destroyed in the present and future by the Resistance, and the idea of a stupid super-virus in this film is too cheesy. I even heard that a 4th Terminator film is in preparation, but I think that it will be awful and useless to see, Arnold or not...In two words this movie can give you suicidal tendencies and drive you sicker than plague if you see it, and it deserves 2 thumbs down, 2 middle fingers up and not the least (riddle me this, riddle me that: it has the form of a famous number, it's round and it's between everyone's butt...)To all Terminators fans: don't watch it, cause you will have the same feeling that I had.

Well there are moments but what are sheer moments when you have an entire film, right? T2 is both a stroke of sci-fi and action splendour. There are not many films, old or new, that can match its ferocity and grandeur.Most of the films success must surely be credited to director Jonathan Mostow. You ought to feel so small coming up against a giant like this. His direction was superb. That includes the nicely choreographed action scenes that dominate from start to finish in the relatively short running time. The soon-to-be-famous demolition crane scene elatedly swept me back to the days of T2 and the strength of that film. Though being several years in transition (twelve years to be precise) Arnie is still in top gear.

522,Izzit249,"Had it's moments, but not quite IT! Bit of a spoiler!",4,11 August 2003,"Terminator 3 has been one of the most anticipated films to have been made in the last decade. The world sat on the edge of it's seat as the time drew nearer to the release date. ""Arnie is Back!"" ""This film kicks ass"", i tell ya man i heard it all.That was until I heard that the reason Cameron did not make this film, is because he read the script and felt it was sub-standard. uh oh!
Then I saw the film. And i really have to say, a VERY big dissapointment.The film was two hours long, it felt like it was only half an hour. The action, well although special effects play such a huge part, it seems T2's more basic moves were better! And where was the classic music in the opening sequence??The actors, Arnie. Always a pleasure to c him, but not quite the performance he gave previously in T2. John Stahl.....what??? rubbish! surely they could have found someone better! I know edward furlong is in rehab, but i'd rather wait however long it takes for him to come clean and have him in this role, other than anyone else! Everyone else is ok though, T-X did cool.The director, Jonathan Mostow. How many films has he made as big screens?? Not many i'd say. He lacks alot in this film, something like Matrix Reloaded, too much action, less story.The characters. John Connor, well written character, drug abuse, life on the edge, somewhat lost in himself, brilliant writing there. But he did not seem anxious enough to see the t-800 once more. You'd expect more from him. His wife, what is it with hollywood and it's new heroine style? it's lost it's touch! Sarah Connor, deceased. WWWHHHYYY??? she was the heart and soul of this film series, she's a primary character, why did they kill her off?? Disgusting. And then, Arnie. He looked too human to be the terminator, the previous ones took time to learn the ways of the world, he grasped it within five minutes, uh uh, no no no no no, a big slacking. And did anyone notice he was sometimes out of breath ""i..am... a.. machine!"" okay he's a robot, but the previous ones spoke like computers not humans, not until the end anyway. Mess up!The story, Very sub-standard. The story moves too quickly. You don't have time to grasp it the way the previous films do. When the t-800 talks of Connors future death due to his boyhood experience with the previous terminator's, and how they only post-poned the war, this is a key factor in the story, it needed to be exaggerated more, it wasn't, 30 seconds tops, and your expected to be intrigued. Oh please! Where's the suspense?? The death of sarah connor, told in ten seconds, no intrigueing of the story, no emotion to the audience to say that John has been left to teach himself, it needed more exaggeration, stretch it out a bit more.Overall, the film looked like a spoof, some of it was more funny than scary, the story was not good enough, the action was too fast moving leaving no time to make a lasting impression And why bring in the US government, we've seen enough of them in these type of films!!! They've exhausted themselves.I hope to god the actors, story, and mise-en-scene come together if T4 is ever to be made! James Cameron is needed badly, and if anything, one final blast to finish the story of the Terminator, a film to eradicate the existance of T3. Arnie is ageing now, and politics is heading his way. So ppl had better move fast!Overall mark, to be fair, 7/10, but could have been better by miles!",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
523,jasonz42,Entertaining film but not at the hieghts of the originals,7,18 August 2003,"Terminator 3 is a classic case of one film too far, but not because it's an appauling film. In fact, so far it's one of my favorite films this year. It has (obviously) some fantastic action sequences, reasonable plot and some meorable scenes. The reason it's one film too far is because to try and compete with its originals and make just as fantastic film is a very, very tough job indeed. Terminators 1 and 2 were grounbreaking films which truly deserve to be in the top 100 films of all time. Sadly, T3 is not. It lacks the character relationship T2 had, the acting ability of Michael bienh (T1) or Hamilton (who is sadly missed in this film), and the new terminator is not played anywhere near as well as Robert Patrick's menacing T-1000 from judgement day. In short, Terminator 3 is an all-out action, thorogughly entertaining film but with poorer acting, and a lesser plot and script. By all means go and watch it, but don't expect anything particularly special. A great saga overall, but i feel that it's finally Hasta La vista, baby.Jas",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
524,sati_84,"James Cameron, where are you?",4,2 October 2004,"After the excellent Terminator and Terminator 2: Judgment Day, we have a trilogy now, which is not necessarily a bad thing. But unfortunately, the third installment couldn't live up to my expectations after the first two genuine pieces of cinema.In the first part, Arnold was the menacing, unstoppable and relentless killing machine. In the second, Arnold was a protagonist. It's a very good idea from Cameron. Let's see if he can make a good performance on the good side. And he could!What we get from the third movie is having Arnold again as a protagonist, even the same model which he was in T2. Nothing new... But at least it's nice to see him again in his best role.The antagonist is now a female terminator (it's just me, or the name ""Terminatrix"" is really cheesy?), which is a good idea. Or at least something new. Kristanna Loken is indeed beautiful and her performance is good - but sadly just ""good"", and not ""awesome"" or ""genuine"" as Robert Patrick's in T2. RP was waaaay better.The story was written in a ""Come on guys, we HAVE to figure out something to make a new Terminator movie"" way. Judgment Day was only delayed? Give me a break! This destroys the whole story of T2, and doesn't offer anything in order to justify this act. So this is rather pointless.The characters are much worse than they were in the previous movies. Kyle Reese was a totally understandable character, someone that the viewer could care about and he was played by Michael Biehn. Sarah Connor was also a character like this in the second - and they killed off her in this. So, we have a new character, Kate Brewster (Claire Danes), who seems like a ripoff of Sarah. She merges the SC from the first with the SC from the second installment. Nice performance from Danes, but this isn't enough to make the movie good. We have of course John Connor - but the character is completely out of place.The action sequences were breathtaking in the first and especially in the second movie (T2 has the most breathtaking CGI I've ever seen). Now, we've got a car chase with a giant truck (does anybody have déja vu?), lots of bullets, some wrestling and giant explosions. It was done before, nothing new! Only the ""hook into the manhole"" scene was memorable (the CGI used in that scene was made by hungarians!), but the other parts of the car chase were simply boring. What do we see? Shaking camera, cars going off-road, and this goes on for minutes... The car chase scene in The Matrix Reloaded is way better than this one. The wrestling between the two Terminators were good, however the Burly Brawl in M:R is better - moreover, it's slightly disturbing to see Arnold constantly beating a girl...All in all the movie deserves a 7, because it's entertaining and fun to watch Arnold again (I liked the gay glasses scene...). But apart from this, it's mindless and not even visually adequate enough.I'm not counting ""T3: Rise of the Machines"" as a Terminator movie. The Terminator saga ends with the closing sequence of ""T2: Judgment Day"" for me.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
525,MaybeTomorrow,Terminator 3: Excellent!,7,24 January 2007,"T3 is a very well made movie with amazing action and awesome special effects. It had very big shoes to fill and in my opinion Mostow delivered a good (not great) film. Sure, it could have been much better but it also could have been much worse. The TX is excellent. Kristanna Loken does an impressive job. She's not as scary as Robert Patrick's T-1000 in T2, but she still delivers. Nick Stahl and Claire Danes are alright. It's great to see Arnold as the Terminator again! Although he messes up a few lines, it does not hurt the film.The problem i do have with the film is the comedy. Sure, some jokes might be funny, but it's not at the right place in a Terminator film. The movie should have been darker and more serious.One other thing that bugged me was mistake they made about John's age. In T2 John is 10 years old. But at the opening of T3, John says he was 13 during the events of T2. I cant imagine them making a mistake like that. Overall, T3 is a solid entry in the franchise and i highly recommend it to action-fanatics.8/10",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

It's the least of the three terminators, yes. But the least in a series of such high quality and entertainment value that to suggest this is one of the worst sequels ever is just plain hyperbolic stupidity. One of the things I keep seeing mentioned is the less serious parts. What is wrong with some humor? It was hardly even close to enough to call it a comedy and none of it was bad enough to induce groans. T2, and even T1, had humorous bits but I don't hear complaints about them. I don't know what people were expecting. They act like this is the Phantom Menace of the Terminator franchise. Please. It's got solid action (including one of the best destructive car chase sequences ever imho), it's exciting, it's got decent acting and effects.

It would be a blessing if  someone would destroy all thecopies.There is no plot.  The first 45 minutes are just one long chase withmassive destruction and nothing special.  The next 45 minutes areequally forgettable.  Schwartzenegger is wooden beyond words,John Connor (Nick Stahl) is a weak-chinned-wimp with none of thebrash charm that he had in Terminator 2 and the woman T-Xterminator (Kristanna Loken) looks like a Barbie Doll.  The otherfemale lead, Claire Danes, is transparent.The movie cost $170,000,000.00 and given this incredible sumand the number of supposedly talented people who worked on thefilm, I expected much more.

528,mikerichards,Well and truly an obsolete model,4,14 August 2003,"The rather unwanted sequel to the sequel of Terminator has limped to the big screen - and whilst its not as bad as it could have been, its certainly not great. Twelve years is a long time to wait for a sequel and T3 feels like T2 warmed over for a kiddie-friendly rating.Ahnult now looks like he's been inflated with a bicycle pump and freshly dipped in wood-stain - he appears to have been freshly varnished and provides a slightly less realistic central performance than the Cuprinol Man. Once again we have to endure his trademarked sense of 'humour', which is about as funny as being forced to sit through 'Patch Adams' at gun-point. Unlike most people moving from a German-speaking country to America, Ahnult's command of English appears to be getting worse. Not for the first time, I wish the film makers would subtitle him - no, I actually wish they'd cast Ahnult in a silent movie, but I can't expect too much.The actors playing John Connor and his wife-to-be are so instantly forgettable that their names won't be bothering major casting directors in the future, (but do expect them to turn up in your local video store 'starring in' movies involving post-apocalyptic kickboxing cyborgs travelling through time).Not to mention which that our best hopes for mankind are so damned brattish that you can't help but root for the machines. On the upside, the new Terminator is very cute and her inflatable breasts are well and truly aimed directly at the teenage male demographic. I have to say that she is perhaps the most attractive way to die since Ellen Barkin did/didn't do it all those years ago in 'Sea of Love', but hasn't someone done the shape-changing unstoppable, liquid metal robot before?The plot - well there might be one, but don't study it too hard - its like one of those 3D illusions that were all the fashion a decade ago - some people claim to see things of wonder, the rest of us just get a headache working out what all the fuss is about. The movie threatens to become interesting only in the last few minutes, but by then you're probably more worried about deep vein thrombosis setting in than the potential end of the World.Oh and can I have a word about the first Terminator machines? Their brutish menace is ever so slightly undermined if you've ever seen 'Short Circuit' - 'Number 5 is ALIVE!'In short - if its a choice between this and 'Hulk' - see 'Hulk'; if its a choice between this and sitting out in the evening sun - slap on some sunblock, after all you won't have long to wait before Blockbuster have plenty of copies of T3 on the shelves.Best wishes,Mike.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

Now the bad aspects. Loken does not fit the TX profile that well, she looks beautiful but a girl more athletic and more importantly a bit muscular would have been the better choice. Stahl is also not a very ideal choice either. he is short and has a softer image. i don't know why Edward Furlong from T2 was not chosen. the continuity had a very strong impact on the appeal of John Connor. Otherwise a taller guy with chiselled features resembling the John Connor from T1. The movie was shot mostly in daylight, T2 was shot in the night giving that somber and lonely feeling putting a fear in the hearts of audience. It should have been followed here.        Action sequences are great, again night would have been better.                 But that sould not spoil the thrill of watching T3.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
533,ACMcC24,Amazingly much better than what I expected.,9,27 November 2003,"*spoilers*   Granted that originally I had suspicions as to why they really made a third Terminator, I must admit that I greatly regret waiting until this movie came out on DVD before seeing it.  The comments made by MM-39 very much sum up the movie perfectly.     Although -like the first two- you have a terminator/terminatrix sent back to destroy the eventual leader of the resistance, that's about where the similarities end.  Reality eventually sets in that the future is set for John, that war is unavoidable. There is no hope of change and John eventually understands the why of this and that there is no running from the responsibility/fate that's his.  Though the movie is sci-fi due to time travel, it becomes more believable with the involvement of very modern issues, concerning the threat of a virus infecting the series of networks that connect and in essence control the world's welfare.  Skynet, unaware that their creation is the cause of this world wide virus, unleashes it (ironically to destroy this virus).  In this, you see the beginnings of the machine wars, with it leaving the dead weight of hopelessness in your stomach, and the final scenes leaving you with the major sense of dread that you felt in the first Terminator.       Arnold, reprising his protective role, isn't the fatherly type that he was in the 2nd.  Sent back by John's wife/2nd in command of the resistance, he is the cold machine who's sole purpose is to get John and his future wife to safety from the initial attack, while revealing a nasty piece of information to John about his future.  All around, I applaud Arnold for reprising this role, since it artfully filled in gaps left by the second movie.  So, overall, I'm more than pleased with #3 and have learned my lesson about assuming before seeing.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
534,Tom16uk,Don't fix something that isn't broken.,5,24 August 2005,"Instructions on how to fix something that isn't broken: 1. Take 2 amazing films. 2. Take the plot and storyline. 3. Take the FINISHED story and try to CONTINUE it with a rubbish excuse 4. Take away lots of violence so that it can be rated '12A' 5. Include some un-scary CGI scenes and acting 6. Make too many jokes an take away the seriousnessYour outcome.. Terminator 3. Its hard to know where to start. Lets get the good pints out first. Kristianna Loken, who plays the T-X - a part machine, part liquid metal robot that makes Arnie, the T-101 look ""obsolete"". Loken does an excellent job an takes the character really well. I think thats the only good point.. Flaws fill this film from start to finish. You can partly blame the new directing that has modernised this film too much, and turned it into some scenes as a joke. Their are no gloomy, well filmed fight sequences as in the previous 2 films, and the jokes in this film are quite utterly poor. The worst idea of the lot was at the start, where Arnie (T-101) walks into a bar and gets his clothes of a gay stripper. Oh dear.. And it gets worse wen he walks out of the bar and puts on a pair of pink sparkly star glasses. Are we honestly expected to believe that a super-intelligent robot, with a database of millions of facts an information would put on these glasses? Thankfully, he sees sense and stamps on them. A slow start to a slow film. Their are plenty more of these stupid jokes, but lets avoid them. The fight sequences are actually not bad - you sense the feeling neither robot will win as they go on for long times. However, the CGI lets the sequences down a little, as with many parts of this film. In Terminator 1, you could become scared through stop-motion animation and real props and makeup. I'm afraid computers seem to have replaced that. No longer do you get shivers down your spine, but more of a sense to laugh. The only good CGI sequence is were the T-X transforms from being Katherines boy friend to her normal self. Its a really realistic scene, and shows what we can achieve in the special effects department. But there's a point you just have to stop. Whats more, this film shouldn't have even been made! In terminator 2, all the computer chips were destroyed along with Cyberdyne. Therefore its impossible to continue the saga. Nooo, because Arnie has a perfect excuse; ""Judgement was inevitable"". More like ""I wanted more money, just like the film company and the box office"". I'm sure everyone got enough money when the film was produced to be rated a 12, so it just so happens that adults and kids can watch it, equalling more sales. You could analyse more problems with this film all day, all I have done is picked out the big ones. For any Terminator lovers that enjoyed the previous film, you may feel almost embarrassed. For first time watchers, you will probably enjoy, as you have not seen the quality in the previous films. The only way to enjoy the whole Terminator saga is to not watch this movie.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

Now, people don't like this because of the weak dialog, the contradictions of ""no fate.."" and other items. As for me, I liked this film as it was a great action film. It also continues the story and it was right to the point. The only thing I knock this movie for is how the story was told. Mostow only scratched the surface with the script and I felt like he needed to have things explained through the character interactions more. Yeah, Robert Brewster runs Skynet. However, Mostow should've had the T 101 explain this as it would have convinced people by shedding some light on the whole story.This film is under-appreciated.

The sheer scale of the destruction is amazing.  I haven't enjoyed a chase this much since Pierce Brosnan took that tank for a joyride in Goldeneye.My main complaint is that with the change from Edward Furlong to Nick Stahl, John Connor went from being a whiny snot to a brooding snot, but remained a snot nonetheless.  If Nick Stahl's John Connor tried to give me an order, I'd push him down and stand on his head.  If they do a T4, let's see John Connor be a bit more heroic, a bit more confident and in charge of himself.  In T2, Connor was a marshmallow.  In T3, they added a graham cracker's worth of hardness.  But to lead like his character eventually must, you need to be a sword, not a s'more.And let's forget the comparisons to Michael Biehn I've been seeing in the user comments here.

That's right, no T-800 or T-1000, but the T-X. The T-X played by one of the hottest women I've seen in a long time (Loken), is an awesome design indeed: a new terminator endoskeleton with multiple onboard weapon systems coated in liquid metal. Holy crap man! That is one bad ass terminator - I never thought they'd top the T-1000, but they did. The T-X kicks ass.The movie is action packed, a non-stop thrill ride as critics might say.

T3 shows what a tremendous budget with little imagination gets you - a terminator whose unique ability is to make her fingers into sharp points. Whoopee! There are narrative lapses too numerous to mention, such as our non-tech hero operating an atom smasher. Or a heroine who doesn't know exactly what her father does for a living traipsing into the super secret underground & armored military installation where he works.

Where T3 fails to live up to its predecessors is mainly in a visual/technical sense. The lighting, framing, editing and music is not up to the level of T2, visually the film lacks drama and makes one long for the artistry that was created through the collaboration of James Cameron and Adam Greenberg. The films design is also not as striking or convincing as T2. The effects are good if not groundbreaking. The film also lacks the epic feel which it should have considering the subject matter. Unfortunately most of the record breaking budget must have been used settling various legal problems. But despite all this the film is great fun, Arnie is amazing and has some good and surprisingly clever lines. Though the film does lack the epic feel this results in a fast paced film that never drags and really makes you wish it were longer. The main chase sequence and bathroom brawl are amazing to behold.

542,antoinecatry,Underrated,7,30 July 2015,"How not surprising I have just discovered the division among fans about this movie while browsing the reviews. I feel the duty to give an opinion in lights of recent viewings : 1) the latest installment in movie theatre 2) the TV series I didn't know, which seems to me quite interesting in some aspects. Agree with most of you : a superfluous sequel, much resemblances in terms of structure with T2. Don't agree : the comedic elements are what makes the difference, they are not lame. Some of you say it's unwanted parody, that I just don't know, I believe it might be intentional : the appearance in the Chippendale spot, the inflatable TX breast, the dialogs ; my favorite is certainly this one T 800 : your confusion is not rational, she's a healthy female of breeding age. John Connor: well, you know, there's more to it than this. T 800: My database does not encompass the dynamics of human pair bondings. Arnold Schwarzenegger has always been considered, in my opinion, capable of ""self mockery"" way before other actors of his kind (Chuck Norris was forced to develop this when his agents made him aware of his commercial impact on fans, I believe), he shows a bit of his self parodic humor potential when quoting himself from Commando (I lied). So, according to these few elements, plus the beauty of Claire Danes, much cuter in red I believe, and Kristanna Loken, I pronounce this film not so bad and worthy of redemption in the eyes of purist fans. The last one, Genisys, was acclaimed in France by most papers (most of them having lost their Independence and only paid to encourage disposable culture consumption), they say it is able to make us forget T3 oh God, we must not have seen the same film. Genisys is full of inconsistencies (the saga is itself a bit hard to follow for the rational mind), complexities, senilities, devoid of fun and drama effects, and there is not a single sound from the Brad Fiedel theme. In my memory, back in 1991 on the big screen, the score was a major source of pleasure and dramatic credibility in T2 ; Bear Mc Creary redeveloped this music for the TV series, which is pretty successful to me, though inessential as well. Inessential also would be for me to review what I think of each films of the saga, the thing is I have not been able to feel the slightest ounce of pleasure since T3, and some of the series episodes.

And there didn't seem to be much point in having a female terminator. That potentially could have been really cool - but they could have done more with it. Hell, they could have even had some fun with it.Then it occurred to me that my expectations were probably too high. I absolutely loved the first two ones.

Telling Kate Brewster to (essentially) shutup in the back of the stolen truck had me dying in laughter, since I could imagine the governor saying that to his kids in the backseat of a minivan.  Okay, enough of my sarcasm -- this was just a great, nonstop action movie. I didn't see the first, really liked the second, but the third (and I'd guess final, since our lead character is both getting old and in politics) will be the highlight of the series.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
545,tomiron77,Edward Furlong...,6,26 January 2004,"I was disappointed that Edward Furlong was not playing John Connor. That might be my major gripe with the movie. And this ""John Conner"" did not really show himself to be resourceful at all---meaning he didn't seem ""special"" enough to carry on this lopsided fight between humans and machines. Whereas the young Furlong in T2 was maybe the most impressive kid I've seen in the movies--while managing to be utterly real!The twist at the end was indeed pretty cool though. Nice. In any case T3 << T2.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
546,jangomac72,Worth it for the final reel,8,20 June 2009,"The third film in the Terminator franchise sees Arnold Schwarzenegger return as a T-850 sent back to ensure John Connor and his future wife Kate Brewster survive the impending Judgment Day whilst a rival Terminator, the T-X, hunts down and kills people important to the future human resistance.Jonathan Mostow steps into James Cameron's big directing boots and produces an enjoyable follow up to the previous instalments but also provides nothing outstanding either. The action scenes are directed competently but you really do feel as if some flair is missing that Cameron would've brought to the film, although the stand-out chase sequence involving a crane truck, two police cars, a fire engine and an ambulance features scenes of automobile destruction rivalled only by The Blues Brothers.Nick Stahl does a good job of portraying a John Connor haunted by his impending legacy and struggling to come to terms with his destiny without the guidance of his now deceased mother (Sarah Connor having died of leukemia off screen between T2 & T3) but you can't help thinking that the film would've benefited hugely from the involvement of Edward Furlong who was originally lined up to return in the role but pulled out and/or let go by the producers as a result of his then current substance problems. Claire Danes does well with an under written role of Connor's future wife and Kristina Loken does a great Robert Patrick impression as the T-X, the latest in Terminator assassins from the future.Essentially a remake of T2, what gives this film extra points is the unexpected twist ending (which I'll discuss without spoiler boxes as the film is 6 years old so if you haven't seen the film, look away now!) It's very rare these days in cinema that a summer blockbuster ends on a downbeat note but the makers of T3 deserve kudos for ending the film with the destruction of 3 billion human lives in the nuclear apocalypse and actually bringing about the event that even Cameron avoided, Judgment Day. The ending alone makes up for the slight feeling throughout the film that you've seen it all before. This film could've so easily been a standard run around with an obligatory happy ending but in bringing the franchise full circle, they take the films away from the now tired concept of Terminators being sent back to present day and give the franchise the opportunity to move the story forward instead of it remaining stagnant. It's just a shame that they didn't build on that promise with the fourth film. 8/10",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
547,capricornius,It doesn't deserve the hate,8,15 November 2018,"This movie doesn't deserve the hate it's getting. Now obviously it isn't as good as the first two Terminator movies. But this is also what's ""wrong"" with it. It's a great movie, but if you compare it to 1 and 2 then of course it won't be great, simply because the two first just are that great and legendary movies.

548,Allen-31,how they should have done it,2,2 May 2005,"What a piece of trash. It's nothing more than a film that tried to outdo the action sequences of its two predecessors. No characters development. In fact, it more features character un-development as we see Jon Connor go from amazingly cool kid with budding leadership qualities in ""T2"" to whiny 20-something wuss in this movie.And it also seems that the director went to great pains to undo the time travel logic of the first two films. Time travel stories naturally have to deal with paradox, but you can't resolve paradox one way then turn around and throw that reasoning out the window in favor of another explanation. They did, and it completely undermined the reasons why we were told the first two stories happened. As it stands, Jon Connor had nothing to fear from the Terminatrix. If fate is after all inescapable as Arnold declared, then Jon could've walked right up to the Terminatrix and planted a big IL' kiss right on her lips and she would have still not been able to kill him because he was fated to be the leader of the future resistance having survived nuclear Armageddon with knowledge of how to fight the machines. Stupid.If they'd wanted to keep in line with the idea that fate can be changed, then here is a much better idea that could have been a plot device to make an exciting ""T3"" movie:Jon is in his 20s. A third T-100 comes back and informs him that new information uncovered AFTER the dispatching of the first two protectors is that one last Terminator was sent back, but its primary mission was to first protect Cyberdine's existence, then eliminate John immediately following the nuclear strike. Cyberdine executives, understanding how radical the research their company was doing, had made extensive back-ups of the information thought destroyed in the previous movie. After the destruction of the main lab in T2, further research was shifted to the military when Cyberdine reformed as an exclusive military contractor whose existence is classified so as to be protected from future ""terrorist"" threats.The plot could have been just as exciting and action packed, but with a new formula. Instead of running AWAY from the enemy terminator, John, the T-100 and supporting cast would be on the offensive actively trying to bring Cyberdine down while the T-1000 or T-X or whatever is disguising itself as a military/Cyberdine big shot and doing everything to ensure Judgement Day and still try to eliminate John so he can't lead the humans to victory 20 years later.Ah, what could have been...",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
549,MorganStable,All things considered - a real good time,8,3 July 2003,"Face it:  T2 is as good as moviemaking gets.  There's no way to beat it, or even to equal it.  Take that attitude, and this movie becomes infinitely better.First:  Arnold.  This role is why he is on Earth.  Still fits him like a glove.These action sequences are not bombastic over computerized seizures like Matrix Reloadofcrapped.   They're based on a semblance of a real world. I personally believed they destroyed all of LA in one car chase.  Truly the action highlight of the summer.Complaints will be heard all across the land.  But T3 moves, has several good set pieces, a corker of an ending, strong performances, an engaging story, and one of our most beloved icons keeping the whole ship afloat.

It also had a radically different tone from the first two. Where they were dark and intense, albeit leavened with some humor, this installment was self-satirical and rife with gags and misquoted one liners.The acting was nothing to write home about. Arnold was a better actor when they didn't let him speak much. Nick Stahl made of John Connor a whiny idiot who I, personally, wouldn't follow in traffic, much less a war. Kristanna Loken was attractive but brought no life to the role. And poor Claire Danes suffered through perhaps the worst miscasting I've ever seen. Her character HAD no character to speak of.I'm troubled by rumors that a fourth movie is in the works. I have this to say in response: LET IT DIE, YOU JACKALS! THE FRANCHISE HAS SUFFERED ENOUGH! IT'S WRITHING IN AGONY ON THE FLOOR, BEGGING FOR DEATH! HAVE MERCY!I give this steaming pile of movie a 3 out of 10, and so high a rating only because Kristanna Loken is hot.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
551,christopher-45,"Crash, bang, wallop, BOOM, but somethings missing.",8,3 August 2003,"After a gap of over 10 years I was a bit hesitant about watching the third part of the story, and left the theatre with mixed emotions, as although good with a stunning main chase sequence something was missing in T3, and it was the darkness and hard edge of T1 and T2 that Cameron produced.It was strange not seeing Linda Hamilton, and her character dieing of leukaemia and then cremation tangent to remove her character just somehow didn't sound right considering what a strong character she'd developed into in T2.Big Arnie was as awesome on screen as only he can be, but he's starting to look his age, and at times I got the feeling he was playing his character for laughs, and with clinches going back to T1 and T2. But, why didn't he kill anyone besides the TX, he is after all a terminator? I hope it isn't due to south California PC attitudes getting into the movies.  Plus with a possible nuclear war coming the story wasn't as stressful and dark as it should have been.Beautiful Kristanna Loken was very efficient as the unfeeling TX, but she's not as cold as Robert Patrick was in T2, but she was one ice maiden as emotionless and as ruthless given that T3 has a different feel to T2.Nick Stahl although a bit whiney at the start, and Claire Danes in a very ballsey role grew into their respective characters, and if T4 to finish the story off gets made before Arnie gets to old they can develop and mature their characters.On a lighter note it was nice to see Earl Boen again although like Arnie he's now showing his age, but it was a case of blink and you'd miss his small part.As for 'Skynet' I hope more of how it works is explained in T4, as we only got a taste of the nature of the chief villain.In conclusion, I personally think to long has passed between T2 and T3, and if Cameron isn't going to direct T4, I hope Jonathan Mostow gives T4 the cold dark edge of T1 and T2 to get back some lost ground.I give T3 8 out of 10 for the great stunts and a good foundation for the final movie.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

This movie, Terminator 3:Rise of the machines, is worth some money seeing. It was never going to match T2, let's be realistic. But it's anything but terrible. There's female injection, but there had to be some to make up for Sarah Connor, it's not a problem. The first half is sufficiently interesting, and the action is sufficiently exciting, but not much more. The plot is well set up, regarding John Connor's situation. Now, I don't want to spoil, but the ending really - REALLY - hits home. Incredibly powerful.All in all, this film moves along from the position of T2, and delivers everything sufficiently well, or even a lot better than that. A worthy third instalment.P.S. isn't it interesting that T3 and Dark Fate score about the same but T3 has mostly positive reviews but D.F. has mostly terrible reviews? Just a thought.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

Hope to see a TV series or something.I fault it for a few technical hits, unnecessarily indecent language, and the tendency of the good guys to give the bad girl every opportunity.  When we barely escape doom, do we pause for breath and pose?  We do not.If you like violent action films, you have to see this one on the big.  If you saw Full Throttle, T3 should recover your loss.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
555,russell100uk,A worthy end to the trilogy,8,11 September 2003,"Okay, this isn't as good as the original or T2 but it's still a damned good movie.It's got everything you want from a summer action flick and bags more. You want action? How about a 20 minute chase involving a giant crane, remote controlled cop cars and a vet wagon? Humour? The new TX has a mischievious nature while Arnie's entrance is bordering on self parodying hilarity. How about effects? Top notch, Stan Winston and ILM creating brilliant futuristic battle scenes, superb robotic effects and plenty of pyrotechnics to boot.
Acting wise I felt Ed Furlong was missed. Nick Stahl was perfectly amiable as the older John Connor, but I really missed T2's Connor, full of young inocence and cool, his flippant character replaced by a scared, frail older version, who wore a constant frown on his weathered face. Arnie was back and was on great form, he just slotted back into his role as the Terminator as if he'd been doing it all his life. As for the newcomers, Kristianna Loken started off interestingly but quickly deteriated, she wasn't anywhere near as good as Robert Patrick in T2, failing to display the menace that anihilation was just around the corner. And Claire Danes as Kate, while an important character plot wise, did little more than scream a lot and look scared.Still, the best thing about this film wasn't the acting, action or attempts at humour, but the bold, brilliant ending. Without giving anything away I'll just say: IT WILL BLOW YOU AWAY!There are rumours of more Terminator films in the pipeline, but I for one hope that is untrue. They should leave it be as this perfectly complements the other two films and serves as a terrific final part of the trilogy.Overall a 8/10 for this one.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
556,Bluecher,Last classic Terminator movie,8,20 January 2021,"This is the last Terminator movie to follow the established formula devised by James Cameron, which means that this is basically a big chase action thriller with road movie elements.
The overall pace is relentless, making the few moments of respite and reflection that much more impactful and poignant.
T-X is easily one of the deadliest, destructive and formidable cyborgs in film history. The influence from Japanese manga/anime on the conception of her character (e.g. Armitage, Battle Angel Alita, Dragonball etc.) is obvious and Kristanna Loken plays her wonderfully.
Mostow's direction is fairly straightforward but perfectly frames the big action set pieces.
Arnold is in top shape - probably for the last the time in his career.Many people have criticised T3 for breaking with the message of T2. I think they are among the few who prefer Cameron alternative ""future"" ending which was mercifully scrapped in favor of the more ambiguous original ending.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

558,pieterwesselsbiz,Underappreciated,8,7 April 2018,"Let's face it. The Terminator franchise has always been kitsch. It's ""classic"" kitsch but kitsch nonetheless. To expect something more from a franchise that started going down the cheesy sentimental route in its second entry is expecting way too much. These movies were meant to be fantastical thrill rides, and T3 is no exception to this rule. In fact, it's a solid blockbuster filled with great action, solid acting, (mostly) well timed humor and great special effects. I also thought it did a good enough job of justifying itself as a legitimate continuation of the universe. If you take this franchise too seriously you will be disappointed with this entry because you will be too preoccupied with how it's ""supposed"" to be.All in all, solid entertainment.

559,fredsab,No flesh,5,15 November 2003,"In the Terminator series, the robots themselves (sorry cyborgs) are composed of flesh over steel exoskeletons.  This movie has the steel but not flesh.It looks good on screen, the stunts are fine, the actors attractive, but there is no depth, just a series of set pieces with loose connections.  Many scenes were scripted just to produce references to the preceding films, and otherwise have no place.  The movie has ""SAFE"", written all over it, the kind of don't mess with the formula filmmaking that dominates Hollywood.But they left out part of the formula, and that is emotional involvement. You don't feel for the characters, there is no fear or sorrow or suspense or anything remotely resembling empathy for any part in the film.  Jokes fall flat because there is no drama taking place that requires comic relief. Clare Danes' character loses her father and fiance to the new TX with barely a moment's grief.  Kristanna Lokken is great to look at but not exactly scary and the scenes of her and Arnold's Terminator character throwing each other around are incredibly boring.  Speaking of boring, Nick Stahl's John Conner has gone from disaffected youth to spaced out adult, supposedly hiding behind drugs because he fears the future.

562,theninja,T2 remains the best movie...,7,10 December 2003,"T3 is still a great movie, and there is a lot to like about it, and I still really enjoyed watching it, however there are some problems with it that make it disappointing for me. Reading some other reviews from people, I can see I am not the only one who had problems with it, and perhaps if James Cameron was on board with this film, it would have been much better.First, Edward Furlong should have been back for John Connor. I'm not trying to take away anything from Nick Stahl, because he did a great job. In fact, he looked somewhat like a younger Kyle Reese, and at times, even looked like Furlong himself, but why didn't they just get Ed back for the 3rd - it would have been that much better if they had.Next, was the fact that the T-101 was still trying to be like the T-101 from the second film, despite the fact that it was a different cyborg. Why was it still copying the behaviour that it's predecessor had been taught then, such as not killing humans and looking for the keys under the sun visor?
Finally, the movie didn't seem to go for long enough, and the story was quite shallow. Elements of a fantastic story were there, but were only brushed over. The whole thing seemed very rushed and actually I was disappointed when the credits began to roll because I thought there needed to be more to the story.Having said that, T3 is still a good movie, by all means, I would recommend you see it, especially if you are a fan of the previous 2 films, or love Arnie. However T2 still remains the best film.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
563,ferry_rudolph,Excellent!,10,11 November 2005,"Reading a lot of negative reviews and that really saddens me.I too did not like it that Cameron did not want to direct this movie. But that is his mistake. I would have done it as it would have been a sure hit and it was a huge box office hit. But it is also a good movie.The story is excellent. Sure it does not match the story from the first two movies but that is because the future was changed because of the interventions from the first two movies. With Cyberdyne destroyed a future was also destroyed.But Judgment Day was or rather is inevitable and that is where the movie shines. I mean Judgment Day IS coming. And it is not some movie thing but the future of humanity. Our arrogance will be our undoing one day and the first two Terminator movies made me realize that. This movie ends in the only way I feel it could have ended. With the near destruction of the human race.It was a new ending and a most controversial one. But I loved it. Not a crappy ending where the humans stop the evil machines or alien invasion. But an ending where we are on the losing side. It was most unexpected but that is what I loved.I also liked the T-X. It seemed right to have a female Terminator and Kristanna Loken played her parts nicely. And Arnold was great as his usual character. Of course the older Terminator model stood little or no chance against the T-X but that was not the point. The Terminator's mission was to ensure the survival of John and Katherine and not to fight the T-X.It seems a bit odd for the resistance to send such an old Terminator model back trough time but this was probably the best they could get. Which would make sense as the T-X is probably a prototype and/or very costly to produce. The T-101 's are foot soldiers so obtaining one of those would be easier.John and Katherine were well cast and played their roles perfectly. Stahl really looked as if the weight of the world was on his shoulders.There were a few minor complaints such as Dr. Silberman. It was neat to see him again but he was head of a entire mental hospital. How did he get to work for a Sheriff's office? I guess seeing the T-1000 really drove him over the edge.I also missed the few key phrases such as ""I'll be back."" ""Or Come with me if you want to live."" I mean the first is one of the best movie quotes ever so having it omitted in this movie was a downer.But the story and action scenes were excellent. The story did not measure up to Terminator or Terminator 2 but was still excellent. There was not a dull moment in the movie whatsoever and even though it was rather straightforward the ending made it perfect.Thanks to the T-X's ability to control other vehicles, the chase scene could be expanded upon greatly, having several vehicles chase the heroes which was a very cool idea and well executed. The other action scenes did their part as well as did the fight scenes.By the way, I loved those. Sure it may be silly watching Arnie fight a woman but it makes sense. Generally woman are seen as the ""weaker"" sex although there are a lot of woman whom that does NOT apply to. But still, a woman tends to blend in the crowds easier than a big muscle man such as Arnold. Which seems to be what a Terminator does best.She could of course take on the form of other humans and at one point she could have killed Kate in the guise of her fiancée but instead reverted to her normal form. Seeing how Kate needed to survive this error was necessary but I like to think that the T-X was just over confident and changed back or perhaps needed to do so in order to access its weaponry.And I am not really a nitpicker because then one can nitpick about a lot of stuff. I mean, in Terminator Sarah is last seen with a dog just in case a Terminator does appear. If John is so worried about the future (and trying not to be registered anywhere so to avoid being tracked), why does he not have a dog himself? I would have one.So I ignore those little tidbits and focus on the good stuff. Which this movie has in spades. I know it is not Terminator 1 or 2 but this movie is still a great addition to the franchise.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
564,Barry_the_Baptist,Brilliance is irrelevant; a serviceable action film.,6,2 July 2003,"Given all the impropitious factors that were stacked against this latest installment I think the film works reasonably well and has at least the visceral appeal that a 170 million dollar blockbuster should have. Yes it lacks the artistry and elan that Cameron brought to the first two installments and yes it does simply rehash and expand previous action sequences that made the first two films so enjoyable. However I found the acting to be serviceable and the human element was palpable enough to the point where it did not feel like a completely boneheaded action film. My main qualm with the characters was with the TX who was not fleshed out enough and not nearly as menacing as the T-1000 from the second film. The majority of the action sequences serve to simply entertain us and do so in spades. However they were also a way to mask the fact that the story was incredibly thin and the dialogue laconic and derivative of the popular catch phrases established in the first two films. But in conclusion it must be noted that outside of the context of the first two films this is a summer action movie that entertains and even makes fun of itself to the joy of the viewer. The action thankfully does not really too heavily on CGI effects and ends up boing much more entertaining than 'The Matrix Reloaded' or 'The Hulk' by action standards. Compared with the first two films it is no more than a road movie with action sequences and minimal sci-fi elements thrown in. Not entirely forgettable but the second one is still by far the finest of the three. 6 out of 10, worth a look for entertainment purposes.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
565,Danielramos16,Too many flaws,5,22 June 2008,"I Love The Terminator films! they are truly unique & revolutionary, why? They were a perfect mix of Sci-Fi and action that had a dark & chilling tone to it. It was almost a warning to humanity about our over reliance on technology. Now we have this new chapter in the saga, Terminator 3. After leaving the theater I left feeling man that was awesome, but afterward I really started to think about the movie and how it compares to the first two films. For all it's great action & adventure it just isn't on the same level as The first two. Many fans will be upset cause it doesn't offer what we loved about the other films.1.) It took too long to make Terminator 3: Arnold is the only actor who can be The Terminator, but now he's getting too old and can't be expected to continue being the terrifying cyborg much longer, not to mention he has become involved in politics so his dedication to making good Terminator films is gone. Also James Cameron wasn't back to direct, Big Problem! James Cameron was a man with vision, he knew exactly how to make The Terminator movies. I'm not sure why he didn't come back to do T3 but he hasn't done much directing in a while. Had T3 been made earlier not only do I think Cameron would have had the energy to direct, but he and Arnold could have come back with time do do a fourth. 2.) Bad tone: This film almost seems like a parody of the Terminator Films. It's far more comical and less serious in tone. Like I said before The Terminator films are darker, more grim, and have a clear morale message.3.) Poor Casting: I hated Nick Stahl as John Conner! he came across as whinny, immature, cocky, and self-absorbed. I mean come on he's suppose to be the leader of the Human Resistance that saves humanity! grow up already! He seemed nothing like Edward Furlongs's John Conner in T2. Claire Danes seemed miscast, this isn't her kind of work and she too came off as whinny & immature. Kristanna Loken is Hot as hell, but she's no Terminator. Having a female as an evil Terminator just seems too awkward, she just wasn't intimidating like the original Terminator or the T-1000 (T2). It was wonderful to See Arnold as the Terminator, he was great as usual.4.) Bad Dialogue: Too comical, and stupid. Couldn't take seriously.5.) A crap Story Line: Too many plot holes. I mean the time line didn't add up, when compared to events of Terminator and Terminator 2. Ultimately the writers wrote a script and came up with a story that underachieved. The Terminator films tapped into societies deepest fears about Nuclear War & artificial Intelligence, the film makers were more concentrated in action, entertainment, and awesome special effects. It also failed to deliver what we really wanted out of T3. I wanted to see the chilling & terrifying recreation of Skynet in the aftermath of T2. Not to mention the other movies were kinda scary with the take over over the machines, T3 failed to capture the true horror and the terrifying possibility of a machine take over, I Robot was better doing that! So what was so great about T3? well the action sequences were fantastic, better then that of the first Terminator but not as good as Terminator 2. Personally I'm glad that Judgement day happened, humanity just had to push it didn't they? After the event's of T2 when Skynet was destroyed it should have ended there, but mankind rebuilt skynet so there for humanity deserved to be pushed to extinction for it's ignorance & stupidity in redeveloping the computer that would destroy them. T3 did deal with our anxiety of future events, cause let's face it we are fearful of what the future holds for us. No matter how hard we try, we cannot avoid our destiny and that has been the one constant about the Terminator movies. And then of Course there's Arnold, without him this movie would have really sucked. T3 was missing many of the people & elements that made Terminator & Terminator 2 so legendary, but Arnold has always been the key piece of all three films. Terminator 3: Rise of the machines was a great action adventure film, it was fun & entertaining, but unfortunately it's just not on the same level as the other two.Now with Terminator 4 coming out sometime in 2009, Arnold as I thought will not be reprising his role. I now fear the Terminator series will take a further nose dive.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

The acting was nonexistent, and the script seemed geared mainly to get the viewers from one overblown set of special effects to the next. (SPOILER NEXT) And the idea that the very place that has been squirreled away in the middle of nowhere and prepared specifically for a nuclear disaster would A) be deserted at the moment of truth and B) have nothing but a ham radio and a podium for the President to speak at is ludicrous even by modern-movie standards.

567,simon-gangl,Arnie is back in T3! Will we see him in T4?,8,7 August 2003,"It´s not better then T2, and I think its not (much) worse. As others said, the acting, effects, action was ok, but Mostow wasnt the right man for this movie. The T-X was as good as the T-1000 (acting), and Kristianna Loken is not the one to blame if you didnt like T3.Here are just some things:1. When Mostow saw Arnold in the leather jacket he said: Now we´re making a Terminator! Well, I´m very sorry to tell you that, but you were making a Terminator also before that. The movie needs too much time to start! Untill the machine is looking into the screen (this was very chilling to me) it´s OK, but then there are a few minutes really, ugly sh... and nothing hapens. Instead of showing Kate and John so much, that should be shorter and he should show us how Arnie got the gun... Then suddenly the Action starts, too suddenly! I think the composition of the movie is very bad, this is indicated even by the fact the movie is just 1:40 long (and for this Arnie had to pay extra!!).2. Humor is OK, but it was too much! It was funny and I liked it (more funny then Bruce Almighty and Anger Management), but somewhere the director must say: It´s enough!3. My most important point (and why I think the movie is not as good as the first 2 Terminators): In T1 and T2 John Connor is not born or hes not very important to the movie. Through the movie we see a cold fight, with less emotion... T3 has too much of John and Kate and their emotions... Even the Terminator is funny...! John Connor is ""The One"", the leader of the people, but this is during the war, this here is before it, John Connor isnt so much important here!It seems that Director and Producer must have a T4 in their minds. If it will be without Arnie it is already sh... and not worth of making it! When Arnie will be back (I doubt in this!), then you need a story directly after the war started, in which John Connor wont show us his emotions, but show us why he is so important; it cant be just that he says he´ll take the lead.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
568,kz7,Doesn't compare to previous parts,6,21 October 2003,"The moment they approved the script this movie was doomed. Choosing a no-name director was perhaps the biggest mistake as one of the greats like Ridley Scott or James Cameron could still have saved to movie. Lead actors for John and Kate are dull and whiny, but also their characters have just nothing to do in the movie except the whining. There are some nice effects in some parts but most of the time it's just annoying. There's nothing original about it. I'd recommend watching Cypher instead but you'll probably want to see T3 anyway just for the sake of it (just like the creators counted you would). I'm betting there's going to be part 4 in the series as well and it will suck just as bad as Alien: Resurrection sucked.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
569,Scarlet_Syndicate,Not as good as the first two but still worthy of the franchise,7,23 February 2012,"Its not very often that film sequels can maintain a franchise and from personal experience, films seem to get worse as more sequels are made. This film didn't disappoint. It may not be as good as the original two but it still maintains great acting, the original back plot and a whole new original storyline of its own.I didn't expect this film to be as good for several reasons 1. being the characters are different. Apart from Arnie, the entire cast has changed and it felt a little empty without the actress who plays Sarah Connor. I was a little disappointed that she had been written out but as the storyline progressed, I realised it seemed necessary. The acting in this film was as good as ever and the actors really pulled off their characters.You'd have thought the writers would have ran out of storyline by the third film but they've just proved me wrong. The storyline works well alone, is unique, and fits well with the back plot already in place. If you had never seen the previous films, you'd probably be able to watch this one and follow it fairly easily.However, I have noticed that they seem to be running out of ideas for new Terminator models and rather than sticking to an original action plot, they seemed to have replaced an efficient killing machine for a good looking woman, probably for the benefit of many guys in the cinema, who it seems, this genre is more aimed at. Another problem I had with this film was the rating. The other 2 films had a higher rating which allowed for more to be done in the film. I think this one seemed a bit limited in terms of action scenes.In conclusion, this is a pretty good film which I think works well in the franchise (not like the awful fourth film). I would recommend seeing this film, just don't expect it to be good as the first two.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

571,sixpack-3,Great Action Movie That Moves The Series Along,9,5 July 2003,"***Minor Spoilers***  While watching T3, one cannot help but notice the lack of Jim Cameron's unique touch to the film.  The movie does not feel the same as its predecessor's.  That being said, T3 is still a great action movie and does much to move the series ahead.  I love the fact that Arnold has to start over with the Terminator character.  He does not have the polished interaction with humans that John taught him in T2 and John even comments on that in the film.  The movie also attempts to tie up many of the loose ends left by the first two films when it comes to the whole time travel timeline paradox thing.  It dives right into the idea of fate and how the previous excursions into the past in the first two movies only served to postpone Judgment Day, not stop it.  They threw a few things in about how things got screwed up by Kyle in T1 and the Terminator in T2.  Mostow does an excellent job taking over an established franchise.  The film does not have the same frenetic style and suspense of the first two, but was well written and directed.  While the first two were both groundbreaking films, this movie does not have anything you have not seen before, but does have something the other two lacked, a raw human element contained in action sequences that are toned down to a more realistic level.  This film definitely moves the series along and will stand out as a great movie if it is used as a transition into a film that deals with the future and the war against the machines.  If it is the last in the series, it will be a great end, not spectacular, but solid and well made.  I liked it and I think most Terminator fans will be satisfied.  Surely, what we will need is a mind-blowing 4th film that does contain something we have never seen before, but enjoy this one while it's here.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

Most critics feel a need to view movies as ""art"" and critique it on that point.  For me, movies are escapism and if they make me forget about the outside world for a couple of hours, they've done their job.  Terminator 3 does it wonderfully!

The film's second biggest flaw is the ending, it's too indesicisive, Judgment Day still goes on despite all that happened in T2? Give me a break! Either make the bunker at the end the SkyNet Core, or at least the film shouldn't have foreshadowed that the future could be changed because at the end the future can't. Also what happened to Brad Fiedel's musical score? (Except during the end credits?) Also more of the future war would have been should have been shown besides the overhead shots that rolled before the opening credits. Dissapointing when compared to the first two.

577,annomy,Please... Don't come back!!!,1,18 July 2003,"**SPOILERS** **SPOILERS**when I came out from the theatre I was praying that there will be no T4 because the ending suggests that there might be. I don't know what Arnold was thinking!! even if there was a 30 MM$ involved, he should not agree to the destruction of the legendary character of The Terminator as they did with this script. the movie should have Comedy in it's genre.when i went to see the movie, i was not expecting much. i knew that Arnold's performance will not compare to T1 and T2. the movie didn't say anything about an emotional chip being added to the machines. if there was one that will explain most of the stupid jokes that T-800 was making. the moment that i saw the star-shaped sunglasses i knew that it's gonna be a Scary Movie type of film... and it was. the film was filled with stupid lines that were supposed to be funny. i laughed... but i was laughing on myself for believing that this movie was worth watching.there was no story line...no plot...no nothing! just a bunch of action sequences and a darn lame ending. the only positive thing about this movie was the arrival scene of the T-X. Calire Danes was good, i'd like to see more of her in the future.if you are a Terminator fan (who isn't) don't see the movie. read about it or yet better to ignore it. the ending of T2 was a better way to remember this icon.I give it 3/10 (for the car chases and the nude scene)",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
578,moviefan69,"Yes naysayers, it IS better than T2!!!",9,3 July 2003,"They said it couldn't be done. No James Cameron. No Linda Hamilton. No Edward Furlong. Arnold well past his prime, both physically, and as a box-office powerhouse. All the early buzz indicated a disaster. But I knew, I felt it in my bones, that this film would be great. Why? Because too many people said it couldn't be done. It's always the way it works. When hype builds a movie up, and everyone is expecting too much (ala Matrix Reloaded), everyone is bound for a letdown. When all hope seems lost, and everyone's expectations are at their lowest, are we then surprised. So thank you all you T3 bashers, you have made me look like prophet! Terminator 3 is not only the best movie so far this summer, it stands head and shoulders above Terminator 2! It actually benefits from Cameron, Hamilton, and Furlong being absent. Camerson has become a Titanic-hugging hacked that peaked years ago. Terminator 1, Aliens, and The Abyss are all masterpieces. He's been on a downhill slide ever since. Sorry Motion Picture Academy, but Titanic sucked the big one. Someone tell me what Linda Hamilton has done besides the Terminator films that is worth watching......I'm waiting.....Thought so. She may have morphed from a whiny waitress, to a female Rambo, but there was nothing else for that character to do. Besides, for all her toughness in T2, she was a much more interesting character in the original. Finally, don't get me started on Edward Furlong. In T2, he was a whiny little bitch that I wished would get killed. He tried to come across as tough, but Furlong is such a bad actor, that he was laughable. T2 also relied too heavily on it's ""ooh"" and ""aahh"" fx. Yes they were spectacular and innovative, but it was too cool to be threatening. Now this is not to say that I didn't like T2. I did. Just not nearly as much as the first. Now comes T3 and the series has been given an incredible kick start. Kudos to the director, Jonathan Mostow. It is my opinion that Mr. Mostow is one of the hottest directors working today. His previous films, Breakdown and U-571, both breathed new life into their respective genres, and T3 is no exception. Mostow does not attempt to be Cameron, and the movie is all the better for it. Mostow brings his own style to the table, and the results are spectacular. The cinematography, editing, and pacing are all top notch. And the action sequences? Incredible! There is a vehicle chase at the beginning of this movie (I hesitate to say ""car chase"" because cars don't really factor into it, unless they are getting demolished) that is awe inspiring. This is what the chase in Matrix Reloaded WANTED to be. It ranks as one of the best chase scenes in movie history. Right up there with The French Connection and The Road Warrior. There is also a brawl between the T-101 and T-X in a public restroom that goes all out. Great stuff. Now what would this movie be without characters? Nick Stahl is PERFECT as John Connor. Now a tortured soul, too torn up by the past to be hopeful of the future, Stahl let's it all hang out. He let's you feel everything Connor does. Hoping for the best, but all the while you feel that fate is going to catch up with you sooner or later. Claire Danes, who I have never been a big fan of, also shines. She is in full Linda Hamilton mode, but better. She is a caring person, but proves that she's tough as nails when the chips are down. Bravo, Ms. Danes. Arnold. What can I say about the man? He may have been away from the character for 10 years, but you'd never know it. Arnold is the Terminator. Now doubts about it. Welcome back Mr. Schwarzenegger, you've been gone too long. Now as for Arnold's nemesis, we have Kristanna Loken as the T-X. Quite simply she, with the exception of Mostow, had the most work cut out for her in this movie. Everyone know what to expect from Arnold. But it is a rule of action movies that they are only as good as their villian. Robert Patrick had the benefit of brand-new CG technology to back him up. While his performance was good, (Especially how he NEVER blinks his eyes while firing a gun. I'd like to see you try that. If you've never noticed, watch T2 and check it out) as I said before, the effects made him more cool than threatening. Now we have Ms. Loken. People scoffed at the idea of a female Terminator to begin with. SO the deck was really stacked against her. Well have no fear, the T-X is here, and she is as bad-ass as they come. Not only can she go toe-to-toe with Arnie, not only can she morph like the T-1000, but she has more than a few tricks up her sleeve. She can reprogram machines, manufature weapons from her arm, and remote control vehicles to really give you a run for your money. She is also one of the most INCREDIBLY beautiul women you will ever see. That adds to her manace, because she has the power of a woman's seductivness on her side, and believe me she uses it. Her beaufiul, icy stare is at once mesmerizing, and terrifying when you realize what is behind those eyes. Way to go Kristanna. Everyone gives their all. The director, actors, and the FX department. But unlike T2, they don't overuse the CG effects. They utilize many styles. GC, miniature work, makeup fx, mechanical effects, and good old-fashioned stunt work. As I said earlier, the chase scene is incredible. Even more so when you realize how much of it was done for real. Simply spectacular. What this movie also has, unlike T2, is the tension of the original film. In T2, you simply dont care about the people. They are only backdrop to the action and fx. Not so here. The makers realized that the characters needed to be as flushed out as the action. That brings the tension level up ten fold. Just like the original. So is it as good as the original? No. But then it couldn't be. So it doesn't try to be. BUT it is a damn great movie, and a big improvement over T2. The best praise I can give it is....BRING ON TERMINATOR 4!!!!!!!!!!!!!",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
579,belikemichaeldotcom,Mediocrity Unacceptable for a Terminator Film,6,5 July 2003,"Terminator films are supposed to rule.  Even in the age where sequels, by definition, suck, somehow Terminator 2 still ruled (maybe even more than the first).  A standard was set, they aimed high and they hit higher with strong characters, a strong story and excellent effects.T-3 did NOT rule, however.  There was virtually NO story, the special effects were completely derivative of T2 (couldn't the cgi geeks come up with something better?), the characters were so devoid of depth that you almost wished them dead and the authors copped out by simply dismissing the well crafted plot of the earlier Terminator films.The introduction of cute one liners from T2 was so overused in T-3 that it got stale quicker than a ""Charlie's Angels"" sequel.  The film makers of T-3 simply cashed in on a proven formula and didn't seem to care one bit about fumbling on one of the best film storylines ever created.  I, for one, had expected that they would have spent much more time on the story and had done justice to the prior films.

Unlike the T1 and T2, there is really no emotion at all.  The ending of T2 was really very touching. You even cared about Arnold the Robot! In T3, there is no real character development, and except for saving the human race, in this film, there is no one to root for because there is no emotional connection with the human characters, not to mention with the terminator or terminatrix. This film is much more violent than the others, and the action has no real purpose, direction, or shape.

583,TB77,"Not bad, not as good as hoped",6,17 August 2003,"It's been 19 years since The Terminator; 12 years since Terminator 2: Judgement Day. Arnold has gotten older, movie-technology has gotten more advanced, but how does this affect the third installment to the Terminator-epic...? First of all, I'm not gonna be one of those critical souls shouting that this is a poor movie, cause one thing must be clear: Terminator 3: Rise of The Machines is FAR from being poor. The story is still exiting, the special effects are as good as you'd expect, the acting is quite OK. However, T3 leaves you a bit disappointed. There is something lacking despite all the fancy camera-work, the high speed chases, the rough action, basically all the blockbuster eyecandy can't remove the feeling that T3 should have been a little bit...better. While watching T3's two predecessors, there has always been a certain unique atmosphere present; an intense excitement; a sence of impending doom when the Terminator is chasing after it's targeted victim. That very atmosphere was what made both films so very good, together with - of course - very well written scripts, great directing, and awesome soundtracks.T3 has got action sequences which are at times better than the first two movies, with crispier CGI. But that feeling of doom, the terror of the terminator is gone. When Robert Patrick was on screen in T2, you felt an eerie presence of his bad guy-character, the same with Arnold in the first movie. Kristanna Loken who plays the female T-X terminator in T3 is a pretty girl, no doubt about that, but she completely lacks the ability to send out any eerie-vibes what so ever. You just don't feel intimidated by her. Her general performance isn't really good either, and despite the fact that she hardly has any lines, it is all too easy to see that she is no Cate Blanchett when it comes to acting. The rest of the cast do an OK job though, while Claire Danes' ""damsel in distress""-character gets a little annoying at times. I love Arnie in this movie, and it's been a while since I did. His latest movies has been quite disappointing, but in T3 you'll find him back in good old-fashioned style. OK, he's not an Oscar-material actor (never was, never will be), but he IS the Terminator!   One of the movies' downfall, is the script. Cause the script for T3 doesn't work as well as the scripts for two first movies did. And while Jonathan Mostow is a talented director (I think both Breakdown and U-571 were good films), he hasn't got the story-telling ability that James Cameron is the master of. Cameron, who directed both the two first Terminator-movies, knows the story better than anyone, and I think he would have been the perfect choice for T3 as well.   But all together, Terminator 3: Rise of The Machines is an enjoyable action-flick, with some very funny moments as well (Especially the ""Talk to the hand""-line from Arnold while walking out of a gas-station without paying for his merchandise). Just a little shame that the movie is not as good you would hope it to be. But maybe a 4th movie will do the series total justice. Atleast the ending sure opens up for a 4th Terminator-epic. I have a feeling that sometime in a not too distant future, Arnie will be back...untill then, I will get out of here!

The story, though as as much of a central as in T1 and T2, still manages to be very compelling, as what would be expected from ""The Terminator."" The effects, though does make use of CGIs, isn't overdone, and relies heavily on Stan Winston's ""Terminator Effects."" Arnold Schwarzenegger's many one-liners, though may abdundant with cheese, still manages to keep credibility with the Terminator saga.

586,Anonymous781,Forced to Give It a 9,9,8 October 2006,"*May Contain Spoilers* Okay, on with the review. I find myself compelled to give this movie a 9 for the things I did like in it. I didn't care for the humor attempts in the movie, like Arnold telling the gas station attendant to talk to the hand or whatever, or when he put on those star-sunglasses in the beginning. I think these movies should remain serious, and shouldn't be tainted with stupid humor, but that's just my opinion. Outside of this, I thought the female terminator could have (and should have) been a lot more attractive. Further, I wished that the actor who played John Connor in T2 was used again to make T3. The new guy just couldn't replace the old John Connor (not that the new guy's performance was THAT bad, its just he can't replace the original). The other thing I didn't really care for that comes to mind was how quick the new T-100 terminator got his sass mouth. The old terminator was much more serious, and had to be coached by the then-young John Connor before he picked up his attitude. The T-100 seemed to do this with very little if any provocation whatsoever from John or John's spouse. Aside from that, sex would be good.. between John and his spouse, and it didn't happen. It shouldn't be raunchy or distasteful, but should be passionate and emotional - and done in a way to further the film. Aside from all these shortcomings I saw in the film, (I kind of think there were more I am forgetting), I have to rate this a 9 because it wasn't a non-enjoyable movie, and there were some qualities that I liked to it, such as the twilightzone-like thoughts that come to mind when one thinks about time travel and all the wondefully interesting ideas to play around with that seem to follow the subject around.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

""Spoiler Alert"" Guess what if you thought John Conner stopped Judgement Day in number 2 you are wrong. All he did was postponed to a later date. Thats all I am willing to reveal for the secrets. One last thing the ending is so good you will want to see more. Unfortunately we have to wait until Terminator 4 comes out.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
591,gaxiola_fk,The third part of the terminators,3,27 August 2018,"Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines by Jonathan Mostow (2003)Well, we have here the third movie of the franchise, not particularly popular.
This film is like an attempt to continue the story with an economic interest behind, which killed the film.
Despite some good things and details that really wanted to continue the story, the development of it is completely boring. Starting with the plot that is the same as the last movie, is all about sending a terminator back in time to destroy Skynet's future menace and humanity sending another to frustrate Skynet's plan.
About the characters and acting, I don't know if is the script or the actors but any of the characters were engaging than Arnold. John Connor is completely changed from the boy that he used to be in T2, an unafraid and smart kid that challenge the world, the mental change could be justified by his possible future but come on, he would be a world leader. Kate Brewster is a simple vet that got in the middle of the fire, we have to accept that is all a coincidence that she met Connor again; and she is more like a mother than Sarah Connor. Obviously, they both were in different situations. And finally, the T-X, a character with no color, I know that it's a killing machine, and I don't care about her gender but the scenes that she provoked were very random, specially the scene of the destroyer truck.
The action is nothing compared with previous movies and popular action movies, nothing creative that no one will remember.
Despite all that, I like how they finally proceed in this movie to the judgment day, the nuclear war that changed the path of humanity and started the events that started it all.
In conclusion Terminator 3 is an attempt to continue the saga, with a big failure in it, could be that we don't have Cameron directing it, maybe that's what make the substance in the movie. Absolutely not recommended, not even Terminator fans.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

593,Sy-4,Shortest and Weakest of the Three,7,11 July 2003,"While T-1 delivered an action-packed and original story on an amazingly low budget, and T-2 added considerable depth and spectacular special effects, the third element of the T-Trilogy seems to be a step backwards.It's not all bad, mind you. All the usual action features are well done and the car chase scene is spectacular (if slightly drawn out). John Connor is also a convincing dropout trying to avoid his fate - a nice contrast with the sometimes annoyingly self-confident Connor of T-2.But what this installment fails to deliver is any real innovation. It ties up a few loose ends and adds a few arbitrary twists, but it just felt a little empty in comparison to the first two.If you're a sci-fi, Arnold or action flick fan, then this is a must-see.

There are SPOILERS following in this text so don't read it in case you haven't seen the flick!It's far better made than T1(no wonder...)and also has a better storyline, etc. but the Terminator-Feeling just didn't come up.Arnie is far too tame. He wasn't as menacing.............. The R-Rating also is a joke. I mean part one was very violent,part 2 toned down the violence(there were short and effective bursts of violence), part 3 only got the R because of the infamous ""killing the detective"" scene and for the nudity. Arnie was not responsible for any of the movie's violence. At least the could have had him kneecapping some people in this one.....But hey............It's just me (an old arnie fan) who wants the Oak to kick some ass..........I guess so or else the movie would have had a much harder edge.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

There's actually a script that develops the story and characters we all love and takes us into new and exciting ways. You just have to see the end to see what I mean. Arnie....Oh my god!!! Just when I thought his career was over here comes the proof that given the proper material he kicks booty!!!! Kudos to Jonathan Mostow.

We have other examples in cinema of when the bad guys get their modicum of revenge (The Empire Strikes back, comes to mind) But this piece of tripe sullies the good name of the previous movies in the series. My life would be better if I somehow I didn't know this was ever made or ever existed. I would be quite happy with the Terminators movies only being T1 and T2. I'm not gonna blame the problems on the actors.

599,brimatt2412,Good casting choices,10,5 July 2003,"Terminator 3 was a very enjoyable movie due to both a good story and good casting choices to surround Arnold.  Kristanna Lokan is the standout of the movie as the ultra-sexy and menacing Terminatrix (TX).  She has terrific screen presence and makes for a cold and relentless villain, on par with Robert Patrick's terrific turn as the T-1000 in T2. Here's hoping Lokan gets more good roles in the future.  Nick Stahl and Claire Danes both do well in the pivotal  parts of John Conner and Katie Brewster.  The relationship between these two characters is central to the film and Danes and Stahl showed good chemistry together.The story I thought was very good with an interesting blend of humor with a grim storyline.  It worked, though.  The movie manages to tell a good story without being too pretentious or taking itself too seriously.  The ending was certainly an eyebrow raiser and certainly distinguishes it from the other two Terminator films.One complaint I have was the lack of the Terminator theme music in the movie(until the end credits, anyway).  But other than that, I thought the movie did what it set out to do- tell an interesting story while entertaining the audience. 10/10",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

There's another great car chase replacing the ones before ittoo, which will really keep you out of your seat. And there's a lovestory in this one! They really make the love story in our day.

601,oddjob99,What a waste!,1,16 July 2003,"As a HUGE fan of the previous Terminator films, I eagerly awaited this installment.  Although, as the release date loomed closer, I began having low expectations for the film.  Simply because T2 was so incredible.  It was an action film, but not JUST an action film.  The action was placed in a story about morality, human relationships, fate, and the possible dangers of the advancement of technology.While T2 succeeded on many levels, T3 succeeds in none.  From beginning to end, I was just sitting there hoping it would get better.  John Connor's opening narration/update made me sick to my stomach - Just start the story already!  The acting was terrible from the entire ensemble.  Kristanna Loken played her part like she was slapped in the middle of a B horror flick, Nick Stahl was weak, and Claire Danes (who I usually really like) seemed to have nothing to do but scream the entire time.The writing was awful, making this an ""ending"" to T2 that just was not necessary.  Character development was pushed to the back-burner, as John Connor's character even regressed at one point.  The action had the distinct feeling of having been done before.T3 belongs right next to Mostow's other waste, U-571.  In the trash. 1/10...........only because I could not give it a 0",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
602,marionaito,"Technically well done, but lacking a good story.",5,11 August 2003,"Terminator 3 is technically well done like most of Hollywood films, and is also entertaining for a young audience. But the film lacks the good story the two  previous parts had. Nothing new you haven´t seen before. The major problem in my opinion is the absence of personal charisma and chemistry of Nick Stahl and Claire Danes in their roles. Both performers had shown before their talents in other films but here they are totally wasted, showing a poor character design for their parts. That´s why I consider Terminator 3 a mediocre movie.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
603,mlg-t888,"He's back, AGAIN",7,25 May 2009,"Yes the Terminator returns for yet another go-round with the unrelenting machines. He will do some new stuff and a lot of stuff we've already seen, but hey, it's still good stuff.I personally enjoyed this film a lot, it lacked most of the first and second films depth, but it still respectable, especially considering it's the third film in the franchise. My friend and his dad also enjoyed the film, they agreed it didn't match the first two but that it was still a good film. This being the first ""Terminator"" movie I had seen I didn't know what to expect, I believed this helped me. Too many people compared this to the first two films and expected it to be the same, but it wasn't, it was actually a fairly good film, just not quite as good as the first two fantastic films. Because I had not seen the other two, I was able to see this one as a film and not just a stack up to the first two, thus I honestly believe it was a fairly good addition to the franchise.The T-X (Kristanna Loken) though amazing in concept didn't exactly carry the coldness that T2's T-000 had, the result being, she was not as effective as she should have been. The acting itself wasn't a perfect gem, but it carried the story like it needed too and there was no particularly large flaw in it.The reason that T3 wasn't as good as the previous movies is because it couldn't bear the emotional heavy lifting that its predecessors did. It didn't contain the emotional passion that Linda Hamilton gave to T2 or the gritty strength of Michael Biehn's Kyle Reese from the original ""Terminator"". T3 does redeem itself though, the ending is one of the most powerful endings to a movie I've ever seen (to the point that it felt slightly disjointed from the rest of the movie). Now I'm not going to spoil it for any viewer who hasn't seen this movie, but the ending of this film is a shocker, especially to fans of the series (Then again with Terminator Salvation out already, most people who haven't seen T3 would have figured it out by now). 7.5/10 Very Good action film, see it.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
604,MrP823,Is this supposed to be good?,1,2 July 2003,"My God. I really don't know where to begin. I guess I should start with the obvious fact that this film was completely unnecessary.  Most scenes in the movie seem to have been blatantly lifted directly from the second film so much so that at many times I felt as though I was watching a remake. After sitting through this mess I had a whole new respect for the first two films as being action/sci-fi classics. I have a sneaky suspicion that this ""movie"" will be one of those over priced blockbuster hopefuls that will be all but forgotten a few years from now. The absence of James Cameron is greatly felt from the opening shot of T3, to its dreadful ending. Although he has been considered controversial because of his constant perfectionism, I guarantee you that the shameful and embarrassing acting as well as the copied storyline would not be found in the third installment had he been involved. Then again, the reason Cameron was not at the helm for this one was because he simply felt there was no more story. Things were pretty tied up at the end of T2, wouldn't you say? There isn't even a proper explanation as to why the events in T3 are even happening.Nevertheless, you just knew a third movie was going to be made and people would be having visions of Terminator greatness on their minds. It's sad to realize that fans of the Terminator films will no doubt be very disappointed (at least I think they will be). There really is nothing good about this movie and it scares me to death to think that if this particular sequel to a very well known couple of movies was this terrible, what does this hold for some of the other announced or planned big money sequels to movie franchises. If Indiana Jones 4, Die Hard 4, or even Mad Max 4 are nearly as bad as this film, God help us all.One more point I would like to stress concerning this movie would be its message/philosophy. Let me get this straight, the main point of the story is that humans simply cannot avoid what is inevitable? This is in absolute contradiction to the second film's meaning of ""No Fate But What We Make"" in which disaster can be averted if we all just wake up and realize what is about to go down. So in other words, the optimistic ending of the second film is replaced by a complete downer ending in the third film that is just hideous in how weak it is. This is bad, really bad and I have to believe that James Cameron is smoking hot with anger. I am going to try my hardest to pretend that this film (and whatever may follow it) never existed. That way I can appreciate just how entertaining and interesting the first two stories indeed are.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

I'm glad I saw the Pirates of the Caribbean after this one (and It was free for me!), that awesome movie totally blanked out any bad memories of T3 ! .......spoilers.............the first sign of trouble: Lokkens inflated boobs when she was stopped by the Cop (ever heard of unzipping ?)which was stupid to say the least. great action scenes and special effects couldn't really hold my interrest as much as the first 2 terminator movies because they were obviously ripped. Lokkens ""Laser"" weapon gets damaged and what ""awesome"" weapon does she have as a back-up ? right a flamethrower (which we KNOW can't hurt Arnold), I was really scared for him now ?!

608,mtillett-202-316442,You should watch it again: in 2020,10,4 February 2020,"I'm 39 years old, and have seen each installment as it is theatrically released. The 1st time I saw T3 I was 23, and enjoyed it very much: way before Fans took over IMDB to play Siskel & Ebert (and become so judgemental of anything not signed by Cameron). I even went to buy the Playstation game which is a blast to play.
Having seen all the sequels by now, I revisited T3 today: and as the closing credits started I felt compelled to write this review. Yes, it's not a Cameron original, but Mostow gave his best: what is there not to like of the chase scene with the crane, which goes without any music until Arnold takes over the fire truck? Intense! Arnold could not have done a better job (powerful and funny as in T2); Nick and Claire are as good and emotional as any scared humans running through the saga; And Kristanna is as vicious as any other Terminator (plus super sexy... thanks to Adriana Lima! I didn't get this joke the 1st time around). Spoiler Alert: if you don't think the best moment of the saga is to see John respond to the 1st stress calls and become Leader of the Resistance... You obviously don't treasure Origin Stories. And this one is way before Batman Begins or Joker (which are masterpieces).",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
609,Chrivhec,A real shame it is.,6,29 July 2006,"When I heard there was going to be a third installment of the Terminator movies, I had high hopes, because T1 and T2 were both absolutely great. My first thought when I heard the title 'Rise Of The Machines' was that the movie was going to be about the war against the machines, because that would have been entertaining, not thinking about the story then. But I was wrong. It's another movie about a Terminator that was sent back through time to kill John Connor. In T1 and T2, that story fits. In T3 it doesn't, and that's because of some major plot holes and disturbing story lines.T3 is a good and descent action movie, but it just wasn't supposed to be. After seeing T2 it was clear that the war against the machines was prevented by the T-800 and John and Sarah Connor. But apparently it wasn't, and that's actually the biggest plot hole of all. In T2, when the Terminator and John Connor are driving to Byson in order to stop Sarah Connor from killing him, the Terminator says 'Killing Dyson might actually prevent the war'. In T3, John Connor says 'You shouldn't even exist. We took out Cyberdyne over ten years ago. We stopped Judgment Day', and the Terminator says: 'You only postponed it. Judgment Day is inevitable'... So in T3 he means that, whatever happens or whoever gets killed(including Byson in T2), Judgment Day is inevitable. That's the exact opposite thing that was claimed in T2. And actually, the fact that a T-X was sent back through time, isn't possible according to the story of the previous films. Because in the beginning of T2, Sarah Connor's voice says ""The computer which controlled the machines, Skynet, sent two Terminators back through time"". So there can't be a third terminator. I can imagine some people might think 'But maybe they didn't know that a third terminator was sent back?'. Yes, that is a possibility. But that wasn't the intention of the story. Otherwise Sarah would have said ""Skynet sent three terminators back through time"". It just doesn't make sense. I wish it did, because I like Arnold and I know Jonathan Mostow is a talented director. And that's why I think it's such a shame that this movie was directed by a very smart man, who blew his reputation by directing T3. Breakdown and U-571, two amazing movies full of suspense, both directed by Jonathan Mostow. I was very impressed by both, and from then on I knew Mostow has got what it takes to make good movies. With T3, he probably saw his big chance of becoming one of the most popular directors in this century, but I think making sure that T3 would be an amazing film was too hard for him. He thought he could, but I think he overestimated himself. James Cameron is a legend and has already made 2 of the best movies ever with T1 and T2. No one could have done a better job, including for the sequel. Damn it Mostow, you're such a talented director, I wish you said no to T3.I can understand why Schwarzenegger agreed to play in this film. Actually he did a pretty good job. It's not his fault that his character 'had to be' different than in T2, he just did what they asked him to do. In T2, the T-800 said that he can learn things from humans. But what we saw in T3 was a bit exaggerating... First of all, the T-800 couldn't have known that the car keys were above his head. In T2 John showed the T-800 that some people hide their keys there, but nobody said this to the T-800 in T3, so he couldn't have known that. They didn't teach him a lot of human things like in T2, so the scene in which the T-800 couldn't kill John and chose to shut himself down, is actually pointless. Conclusion: this movie shouldn't have been made. I just hope Jonathan Mostow realizes his mistake, and hopefully he'll get another chance to prove he really is a good director.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
610,gav_mcf,"Not a scratch on the originals, but T3 rounds off the trilogy nicely",6,11 July 2009,"Firstly I'd like to say I'm a huge fan of Terminator and T2, unfortunately T3 is worlds away from the quality of them. It's not an easy task to live up to two of the best sci-fi films ever. However, that doesn't mean it isn't worth a look because there is a lot to like.Jonathan Mostow takes over from James Cameron in this installment and deserves big credit for carrying on the Terminator journey well and creating exiting action along the way. Some of the set pieces are breathtaking, including a brilliant fight that involves a crane and the graveyard scene is very good as well. In the action stakes, not much more could have been asked for is probably the films best strength.As for the casting, I'm sorry to say that its mostly bad news. Arnie seems too old and didn't have the same impact on me as he did in the previous films. He looks a little bit out of place in some of the action scenes as well. The T-X, played by Kristanna Loken is OK but by the far the weakest villain of the trilogy. Loken is not bad in the role but the character could have been much better. Claire Danes as Kate Brewster seems out of place and is definitely miscast. But there is Salvation (ha!), Nick Stahl is excellent as John Connor and carries on from Edward Furlong easily. I was disappointed not to see Furlong back as he was brilliant in T2 but Stahl is good and was unlucky not to be offered to reprise his role for Terminator Salvation (you can hardly argue with Christian Bale though).Overall, Terminator 3 is an above average action film and packs some great action into the running time and has an interesting plot with a few surprises I didn't see coming. Another high point is the excellent, downbeat ending that leaves you wanting more. Don't expect another film as good as Terminator or T2 because you will be disappointed, just enjoy the thrills, the story and the excellent action.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
611,MsFarEast,Feels like a Michael Bay film.,1,21 August 2007,"Ever since I've seen this in theater and most recently on cable, I thought ""this is just like Michael Bay's films"". And that thought serves me right; T3 is just like Bay's steaming piles, only difference is it's not directed by him. But for some inexplicable reason, the director chose to follow in Bay's footsteps and ends up making this film as if he looked through his anus for inspiration. Was they sleeping together when they made this? I can't say for certain, but maybe if I get or borrow a friend's copy, pop it in my DVD player and turn on ""Director's Commentary"" I may find the answer to that question(and thus will most likely return it back to the store or friend when done with such film). This is one of those films you find at a cheap motel in some seedy part of of a city populated by unspeakable horrors of ""society"". Not a guilty pleasure by any means, but you get the idea.

The film is loaded with special effects & is almost pure action from start to finish. The ""New"" Terminator has minor weapons upgrade, using a plasma device made from her arm, but other than that, very little changed about the new hunter, and of course, the old T-101 played by Arnold, cannot be killed until the mission is complete. If you want something better than T2, you need a different movie. If you want to see what Stan Winston & ILM have done with the T-1000 to make it the T-X, I'd still say to wait for it on DVD.

Car-chases get a whole new and deeper meaning and all Femme Fatale of history grow pale compared to this one. Cameron's elements of story-telling are kept alive and embraced. The humor was not far off either. So I must say, this is one of the best action movies in a long time.

615,RoxanneAndorfer,"The more I think about this movie, the more it grows on me.",8,6 July 2003,"I didn't go to see this movie with very high expectations, because it has gotten such varied and sometimes disparaging reviews this forum.  However, since I am an aspiring screenwriter and true cinema fan rather than simply a moviegoer, I decided to give this movie the benefit of the doubt.  At the very least, I could end up writing a scathing attack on it.Instead, I have found that I enjoyed the movie as I watched it, saw some flaws, but have discovered that the more I think about it, the more I want to give it a higher rating than I initially did (7).  The film's two major dramatic flaws, in my opinion, are: (1) An over-the-top chase scene that comes way too early in the script without sufficient build-up in suspense leading up to it; (2) A little too much campy humor recycled from the first two Terminator movies.The good outweighs the bad by a large margin. (1) The screenplay has some intriguing plot subtleties that grow on me after awhile, the most notable of which is the actual nature of the safe place.  It could be the way it is for several possible reasons, some strategically favoring SkyNet, some the humans.  Any of them could be spun into a major plot element for a sequel. The rest you'll just have to find yourself. (2) The character development of both John Connor and Kate Brewster is elegant, believable and moving, and also opens possibilities for future character development. (3) The plot is an interesting variation of the ""Reluctant Hero"" theme, which is a classic in literature and drama and always will be.  John Connor is a hero who is almost an anti-hero.  True, they could have sharpened his ambivalence a little (sacrificing some chase footage for it would have been an excellent trade, in my opinion). (4) The Terminatrix is a very good villain: She's young, she's sexy, and she's chillingly soulless.  She is actually too smoothly sexy and physically perfect, but that makes sense when you consider that she has been created and programmed by other machines who, lacking the real-world experience of humans, can only base her appearance and humanoid behavior on their knowledge of human stereotypes.That last leads me to some thoughts about Arnie's character.  He is clearly getting a little too old for a reprise of his customary youthful, physically perfect role in any sequel.  If he is brought back in a sequel - and I hope he is - a good, imaginative screenwriter could really work with his advancing age and loss of physical perfection.  Since he is programmed by humans with real human experience, he could be brought back as a deceptively older and less physically powerful character, but more psychologically sophisticated (more like a true human with a soul), and his deceptive physical appearance combined with his greater psychological sophistication could be his aces in the hole when his strength and nonhuman cyborg qualities are insufficient.  In other words, he could be shaped into an amazing supporting hero in any sequel. Maybe I could write his role!",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
616,RoxanneAndorfer,"The horror, the horror...",8,7 July 2003,"NOTE: CONTAINS UNQUESTIONABLE SPOILERS!Oh, yeah!  This movie is a perfect prequel to what can be an even more terrifying, intense, Orwellian and Fritz Langian T4 that can totally eclipse the first three.  If I were writing the screenplay, this would be my opening:The missiles are flying, the nuclear warheads detonating.  Every single bit of the horror we baby-boomers tried so hard to prevent in reality and to capture in nightmare fiction and film during the Cold War in ""Level Seven,"" ""Fail-Safe,"" ""On the Beach,"" and ""Seven Days in May"" finally comes home to roost.  But it's not the Soviets or the Red Chinese or even terrorists with black-market nuclear weapons who are responsible: It's our own creation, born from our fear and hubris - SkyNet.Scenes of people of every nation being vaporized in the middle of their day and night work and play activities around the globe are accompanied by the dark, apocalyptic chords and lyrics of ""House at Pooneil Corners"" by Jefferson Airplane (remember that one, fellow baby-boomers?)Gracie Slick sings as a SkyNet craft...""Circles...like a vulture.""After a few short minutes of mind-bending horror that make us wish we had never invented atomic bombs or computers or even been born - instantly making us all almost Luddites - we find ourselves in a creepily silent post-apocalyptic world as only Industrial Light and Magic can portray them. It is possible to even tie this vision of hell in with technology we ""successfully"" harvested, retroengineered, and exploited from Roswell in 1947, but which we - the true sorceror's apprentices - never, ever completely understood.Scene upon scene of devastation assault us as the opening credits roll - we wish we had never started watching T4 but now we can't look away - and Marty Balin's angelic voice rises...""From here to heaven is a scar, Dead center, deep as death..."" ...and Gracie Slick's voice joins his...""All the idiots have left..."" ...followed by the whole band...""...the idiots have left. Cows are almost cooing, Turtle doves are mooing, Which is why...""The music starts to fade, and we are there.""...a Pooh is poohing In the sun...""Somehow, a stuffed Pooh Bear lies unharmed next to his dead child in a sunny yard (a ""clean"" neutron bomb might accomplish that trick).John Connor and Kate Brewster will emerge as our leaders in the counter-revolution, though neither ever wanted or bargained for it.  (But neither did Winston Churchill, in the years between WWI and WWII.)
So will Sarah Connor.  Nope, she ain't really dead, folks.  She faked her death (why do you suppose her coffin was filled with guns and ammo that her son could easily procure anyhere instead of either her body or sandbags except as a message to her son if he's clever enough to figure it out after the dust settles - maybe Arnie knew about the ruse - we now know he can lie - and maybe not). Those two  are humanity's only hope, there in the depths of Crystal Mountain (except possibly for Sarah, who I'd have underground in Mexico), with obsolete computers that have never been linked to SkyNet because they were created in the days before the DARPANet and the Internet were even thought of.  They're slow, and they are programmed in almost archaic languages such as Fortran.  But they work, and they are uninfected.This is a screenwriter's dream.Bring it on!",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
617,cjtyo,Extremely disappointing,5,23 November 2003,"They should have left well enough alone. The only thing that saved this movie was the ending, otherwise it is a complete waste of time. Even the two or three humorous lines by Arnie can't make up for the poor plot, poor writing, and excessive special effects.This was definitely made for young men, the T-X sucked, she wasn't menacing, interesting, or threatening, unlike the T-1000 in T2. But she had big boobs. Whoopie.The acting of the two main human characters was mediocre at best. I'm not sure what the writers and director were thinking making John so slow witted and insipid, it did nothing but irritate and annoy.I bought this sight-unseen to have the complete series, and I'm sorry I wasted my money. Like the Highlander and Alien movies, it's a shame when Hollywood doesn't recognize it's time to STOP MAKING SEQUELS!",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
618,thewoodmeister,How do you follow Terminator 2 Judgement Day?,6,4 November 2019,"Terminator 3 Rise of the machines tries, but is hindered by the absence of the original cast. I guess this was due to Edward Furlong being ""otherwise engaged"" and Sarah Connor being killed off ""off screen"". I wonder if Linda Hamilton was even considered to return? Hmmm.You know even with my casting concerns T3 isn't too bad, certainly not the real stinker in the series. Nick Stahl arguably does a half decent job in furthering the John Connor story, would it have been better with Furlong? Who knows.The story was a gift really, as we prepare for Skynet becoming self aware. This is what the story arc has been leading up to.... Judgement Day. It's also the 1st time that we hear that it's not been erased but just postponed, something that other sequels including Dark Fate would borrow to explain and justify their existence.The addition of a female terminator in the TX is an interesting twist and an evolution on what had gone before, she was certainly played straight in a similar vein to Robert Patrick's T-1000.The same can't be said for Arnie who is playing it for laughs at times almost as a parody of the T-800 he first portrayed. This is probably my main issue with this film, as the franchise looks to appeal to as wide an audience as possible. Shame.The ending was an interesting twist on the narrative that had been built up, judgement day can't be stopped only survived. I didn't see that coming and I was surprised. This set the franchise up for John Connor truly leading the resistance. Something that we kind of got in Salvation, kind of.So, should you see this movie? Yes it's an interesting study on how to take a movie franchise on after two cracking instalments and the departure of arguably the main reason for that success.....James Cameron. It's not perfect and marginally better than Genisys in that it doesn't mess around too much with a tried and tested formula. That said it's still only a 6/10 for me.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
619,tbaybars,Pure twaddle,4,5 October 2003,"It is sheer coincidence that I saw this film just when Schwarzenneger presented his nomination in the political arena.  But not surprising, really, when Hollywood is taking over the Capitol and the trend that started with Reagan's Star Wars shield to protect American innocents from the evil threatening the globe, has been taking new twists and turns.  The obsession has a long history, since the invention of the cinema which has played a far greater part in American politics than any other single influence.  From Griffith's fascistic Birth of a Nation to milder modes of Star Trek and currently Star Gate.  The message is always, ""We, the American Nation, know best, and will fight to the death to convert the others to our own way of 'democracy'"".T3 is no different, the righteous America defeats evil (even in the form of a very sexy terminatrix).  It is as if the collective American ID is trying to invite a catastrophe of immeasurable magnitude beyond the make-belief scenarios of Hollywood.  9/11 will sharpen this paranoia enormously until the whole continent turns into a kind of Howard Hughes. To exorcise this growing paranoia in films like T3 and others of the same ilk, is like holding a tress of garlic against the invisible face of absolute evil.It must not be forgotten that in the Forbidden Planet what destroyed the planet was the uncontrollable ID.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

Oh Dear!!,1,10 September 2008,"being a huge terminator fan since a young age, i can honestly say when this was released, somewhere in the back of my mind, i wasn't looking forward to it, but then again i gave it a go at the cinema's.as most should be aware the story ends at t2, and the fact both are made by Cameron, it is clear he had no intention of continuing a story that had no other plot needed. also note most of the actors did not show up in t3, i think they knew it would kill their reputation, but i guess Arnie knew he would get some degree of fame.Now did i like t3? oh dear no! i agree with other reviewers, its just one big chase scene, confusing and senseless. apparently the leader of the resistance sent the cyborg twice to ensure the future which he occupied ceases to exist! huh????? i couldn't help noticing the music was dull and not captivated, the fear and keep in suspense qualities that was presented in the past. i honestly got bored waiting for that something to happen, but it didn't! now i found out they will have a fourth instalments. oh dear! simply put, good action scenes from an otherwise rubbish and insult to Cameron's babies. i just imagine to myself this movies has no relevance to terminator itself.It kinda kills the beauty if you catch my drift.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

This director didn't know what the heck he was doing.  what was up with arnold saying ""talk to the hand"" or putting on some elton john shades?  this movie lacks originality, suspense, a hardcore edge to it, a good soundtrack, and in my personal opinion, i thought arnold was a jerk in this movie.   you almost wanted him to self terminate at the end. after the first 15 minutes of this movie, my stomach started churning with the way they mutilated this great film.  the way they overlooked the story of the first two and just decided to create an all new plot to this one. and don't expect this film to be a great trilogy, its gonna be sequel garbage now.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
622,badstrong31,Who the heck would direct such an awful movie?,1,20 December 2009,"When I first saw this movie. I knew that James Cameron didn't direct this. Why?, you may ask. James Cameron makes GOOD movies. I was expecting this movie to be awesome, and since it was a Terminator movie, it had a lot of potential. I'm not really surprised, though. 3rd movies are always the worst. For example, Godfather 3, Poltergiest 3, Alien 3, Back to the Future 3, and Karate Kid 3. The only good 3rd sequels I can think of are Goldfinger and Return of the Jedi. I was expecting an action movie with a good plot line and character development and good acting. The robotic Terminators in the first 2 movies also were kinda realistic because terminators are cyborgs. But here's how this one was. There was no good acting, there was only running and screaming, Arnold wasn't as awesome as he was in the first 2 films, and they replaced all the special effects from the first movies that are realistic because of terminators being cyborgs with CGI. I mean, why not replace robotic looking robots with computer animation? To make it look better?! CGI looks awful. I'm real mad at James Cameron for not directing this movie. Maybe then it would be decent. However, the first two movies are so good that I almost forgive James Cameron for not directing the latest ones. James Cameron, I forgive you because you've made too many good movies to slander your reputation.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

Ah-nuld's oneliners were hardly funny, the acting of Claire Danes and Nick Stahl was stale to say the least and the plot of the movie was that there is no plot. This does not predict much good for T4. They should have never done T3 because T2 was thet best it was going to get. Ah well, can't have it all ...",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
624,CoolClones,Something of a triumph.,10,8 July 2003,"I feared the worst when I read that this movie was going to be made. Without Jim Cameron I thought it was in danger of becoming another Robocop 2.
I have to admit, having just watched it, I kinda liked it. Arnold Schwarzenegger although older excels in the role of The Terminator, it seems like a silly thing to say, but he IS the Terminator and reprises the role as well as anyone could have hoped. The key thing was always going to be the story in making another Terminator movie. In this case, I think it really works and remains true to it's origins.It's a great action blockbuster and I'm sure it's gonna make loadsa money.Hope Jim Cameron liked it!",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
625,NickSavage,Great Film- All Things Considered.,9,4 August 2003,"When I went to see Terminator 3, I was so afraid of what I might be in for. So many sequels in years past have really let me down.  But, in spite of James Cameron and Linda Hamilton's absence, and the fact that this was made over 10 years after T2, this film was not bad at all.  In fact, I enjoyed this over all other summer movies so far.I thought the action and the effect scenes were great, as well as Arnold's third performance as the terminator.  And that ""Terminatrix"".  She was perfect.  She came as close as one could wish for in terms of a superior cyborg and was ALMOST as menacing as the T1000 from T2.  This movie also does a good job of staying on track with the original story.I've heard comments about how the ""time travel stuff doesn't make sense because John Connor bla bla bla""...  Lets face it folks, when you try to work out all of the impossible scenarios with time travel movies like Back to the Future, Terminator, etc., you can find a million ""but what ifs"", so don't think that hard.  Lets remember, its fiction.I would highly recommend this to all Terminator fans, as well as fans of Sci-Fi or action movies for the summer.This ones definitely going in my DVD collection upon release.8 out of 10.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

It was too short. It did have some potential, yet it could have been better. But it was a good action film. I just don't see how T4 is going to be made, with the series and all. Its just not all going to fit together in the long run. But i did like it, and really don't get why other people don't. I guess it's because the first two are classics.

The movie had great special effects and I enjoyed the T-X villain, but I felt so cheated by the ending. I also really felt like Cameron should have done more to bring back Linda Hamilton's character. Paid her more, given her more incentives or just written in a heroic role to which she couldn't have said no. Claire Danes is NOT an action star and, while I think she did okay in the role of action star, the movie was handicapped by her whiney presence along with that of the new ""John Connor."" What I really hated was how the ""Good"" Terminator character got sent back... or should I say WHO sent him back. The circumstances surrounding it, etc. I really felt, as I said, cheated by so many things in this movie. It leaves you with a very hopeless feeling of the future, unlike T2 in which the viewer was left feeling incomplete but perhaps in a more positive frame of mind.

The only thing T3 has going for it is its adept special effects, but these are USELESS when the script is abysmal. Terminator 1 was a brilliant action movie, followed by Terminator 2, one of the few sequels in history to surpass its predecessor in quality.

630,Master_Yoda,Rise of the Mayhem or how to cover the lack of plot with incredible action scenes. (Might be spoiler),8,14 August 2003,"Here we finally are. The long time promised Terminator 3... I was disappointed to hear that Cameron was too busy writing scenario for is Dark Angel crap and earning money from Titanic to do a Terminator 3. Maybe he also didn't want to do it but at least he could have participate or writing the script. (no film from him since 97 he never waited so long for making movie)Because oh my god, the plot is gone. What made the first 2 Terminator such good movies was the plot and the depth of the characters. But this time it's only shallow shells and bad acting (except from both Loken and Schwarzenegger) And where there's a little of plot most of it is incorrect regarding the previous terminator. (and I'm not talking about James Cameron Coda in the never seen before version from Terminator 2)The wrong guy died in T2 and despite all the research and material which both Skynet and the T models are based upon are destroyed, everything is still the same and all the Terminator and Machines just look like the same. the T-101 after making a shooting in a pack of Policemen is checking for human casualties which as no place in the film since it's not the same Terminator John told about how wrong it was to kill people. As for Sarah Connor dying of Leukemia it's not directly a plot hole. But how lame that was ?Now to the good parts.The T-X. Great idea a female Terminator is something they should have done earlier for a simple reason, women are less suspected than men. So the beautiful woman the T-X is would more easily be undercover than the T-101 big muscles with killer face.The Action. Ever present and never boring. They've done a great job with the action scenes. Long but not too long Car chase with a good use of the environment, Short but effective gun fights and the cherry on top of the cake, great fight between both Terminators (too short to me but we cannot have everything we want in a movie).Now about actingArnold Schwarzenegger: The same old good T-101 and it's best role so far. He was better in T2 but still know how to make a good old fashion cold hearted killing machine.Nick Stahl: Laughable, He as nothing to do in this movie even though the plot and the acting parts are really not the thing to focus on. Stahl just did a poor version of the always on the run disturbed guy. If Judgment Day actually happens, with is lack of Charisma and being the leader of the revolution... we're screwed.Claire Danes: (Spoiler) Good actress but average performance she does too much screaming and the line she had were not the brightest. She lose her Fiancé cry a couple of tears then talk about John and her making out with a big smile on her face.
Kristanna Loken: Great in the movie. Too bad she has not that many lines. Because her acting as a killing machine is very credible. She brought the cold blooded ice woman to the top. Plus she has many face expression in the movie which makes her part very difficult and yet did those scene to a near perfection.
Overall: As an action movie it's a great movie. I gave it 8. If you are a diehard fan from the first two opus you might be truly disappointed. But I took it like a related film not like a sequel which made me enjoy it to the fullest. Fan of action go see this film.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

I think not. Pointless and very, very disappointing is more apt. I have been generous in my rating. What Terminator 3 shows is that the absence of a good story cannot be patched up with the now all too familiar CG scenes. Arnie looks and is old and the intensity that Linda Hamilton brought to the earlier two films is gone. The plot was almost certainly written in the 1950's and Ed Wood did it better. It's as if it's a plot searching for a reason to be and hoping no-one will notice the colour by numbers patchwork that passes for a storyline. This could have been wrapped up in 20 minutes in the vastly superior T2, had it been written. In the end we are being treated to an exercise in pure capitalism.

Atypical Hollywood third act in a brilliant series UNTIL NOW! As you can read from the goofs page and see in the movie some one didn't do their home work and didn't pay attention on the set, reading the script and in editing! Mr. Mostow what have you got to say for your self? This is a pitiful sequel! The plot AND action are SO full of holes that you can use this as a fishing net. The future will agree whit the people who think this is scum. T3 will end up being the almost unmentioned third movie in the DVD box set. Most people will newer even take it out of the box. Why would you want to? Who wants to invite the guy that spoils the party? The premise promises a watch able movie, but the execution fall flat on its face. It manages to fly for about 45 minutes if you excuse the constant ""action"" bloopers that you are used to seeing in 80's action but this is T3 not Commando 2. All I can hope is that T4 is newer made and they release a dir.cut DVD whit 60 min of new footage (please omit 30 min from the end!) and 20 min of added length. There are only 2 good thins in T3 the new terminator, she is sexy and a nice ""robot"" and the nasty action in the beginning in the T1 style of ""are you Sarah Connor? BANG!""

The score messes up everything. Not only does it not match the size of the picture (scenic size, music is too static and too close, making the image look small) but also it is wishful, meaning that the score is trying to add emotional aspects that are improper and unfitting to what is actually displayed. Someone might have been really really excited to do this score and might have had an overenthusiastic producer, but the central idea of the movie was not understood. If the score had been more traditional and not overexcited, the whole title could have been a decent 7.8

634,wirestone,Chases and Twists,6,6 July 2003,"Wonderful fight scenes - after watching The Matrix and its clones, the ""retro"" down and dirty fight style between the two cyborgs are almost refreshing. No Wired-Foo!!!Wonderful chase sequences - the huge trucks and several blocks of condemned buildings being crushed look much less choreographed than the dozens of sports carts used in 007 and the recent Bond clones.Good story and screenplay - even though most of the film is devoted to pure action, the actors are given enough screen time to let their characters shine through, especially Claire Danes, who did a wonderful job playing both Sarah Connors of the first two movies of the series (you will know what I mean when you see the film).This is definitely not as great as the first two Terminator movies. Most actions in the first two take places during the night, and the darkness adds a much more hair-raising air. Instead, almost the entire T3 takes place during the day, and it's just not as scary, plain and simple.Also, director Jonathan Mostow showcases his skill on action, but he clearly lacks the personal touch of James Cameron. Even though the T-X is more powerful than anything we've seen in most Si-Fi movies, she's just not as cold and scary as the first two assassins played by Arnold and Robert Patrick. The eyes of the first two cyborgs in T1 and T2 send chills down my spine; Christana Loken just doesn't have the feeling of a sharpened blade like her male counterparts.But still it is a good movie, especially the twist at the end of the film that will force you to reflect on the world and your own life. And I must comment on the makeup artists, who has done a wonderful job make Arnold actually look much the same as in T2, more than a decade ago.However, the movie left me with a bitter taste in my mouth as I leave the theatre.--- S P O I L E R ---The first two movies emphasizes on a single line - ""No fate but what we make"", the twist at the end, even though good for storytelling, totally negates that simple ideal. It wipes the efforts in the first two films clean and basically says that you cannot go against fate.Not surprising though, as the first two films reflect on the 80's - ""you make you own fate""; whereas T3 reflects on a much more spiritual 90's - ""you cannot avoid your fate"".No wonder James Cameron doesn't want to be involved with this one.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

637,Comiccritic83,The best film I've seen of 2003,9,21 July 2003,"7/21/2003WARNING!! WARNING!! MAJOR PLOT SPOILERS DISCUSSED HERE! DON'T READ IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE MOVIE YET!!Still with me? Good.""Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines"" is not only my favorite film of the ""Terminator"" trilogy, but it's also the best film I've seen of this year so far!We all know the ""Terminator"" story: John Connor is the leader of the human resistance in the year 2029, helping people fight against the deadly machines that try to wipe out humanity after they take over on August 29th, 1997. Connor ultimately destroys the machines, but before he does, the machines send robots back in time to kill Connor before he can become humanity's savior. In the first film, a Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) was sent back in time to 1984 to kill Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) before she gives birth to John (later his date of birth revealed to be the year 1985), but it fails.""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" took place in 1991, where a 10-year-old John (what? If he's 10, shouldn't it have happened in 1995?) is almost killed by a T-1000 robot (Robert Patrick), but it fails when another Terminator (again, Schwarzenegger, re-programmed to protect John and becomes a father figure to him) helps the Connors apparently stop SkyNet, stops the T-1000 and later lets Sarah help it ""self-terminate.""The film revolves around 23-year-old John Connor (Nick Stahl), who wanders from place to place and wishes not to be found, for fear that the machines of the future-yet-to-come will try and kill him.Guess what? He's right.Judgment Day wasn't stopped. It was only delayed.The Terminatrix, or T-X (Kristanna Loken), is sent back in time to kill Connor. Since Connor has no connections by an address or phone number, the T-X instead starts to kill his future lieutenants in the war to come one by one. Two of the TX's targets are veterinarian Kate Brewster (Claire Danes) and her father (David Andrews), who has a key role in the activation of SkyNet, the sentient program of the future machines. Kate is particularly important - she shares a past with John, and a future (turns out she becomes his wife, his second in command and the mother of his kids).Later, the Terminator (again, again played Schwarzenegger) arrives in our time after it is re-programmed by Kate to protect her and John in this time (hope you understood all that). Anyway, the Terminator eventually finds them and tries to save them from the T-X, but it also must be careful around the new, deadlier T-X, who can destroy and control other machines as well.The fight scenes and visual effects are nicely done, and cast itself does a good job with their roles. Schwarzenegger, Danes and Stahl give great performances, especially since Danes goes through the most in the film - she loses her father and fiancée, Scott (Mark Famiglietti), to the T-X and does a nice job in the scenes where she's with John. She even takes out a machine with a machine gun while trying to stop the machines (to which John admits, ""You remind me of my mother."")Even Loken makes the T-X out to be a worthy foe of the Terminator (though she lacks the creepiness factor of Patrick's T-1000 from ""T2"").What I especially liked was the lack of gore than what the first two films had (though it has its gross-factor moments, like when the T-X punches her hand through a cop's chest), and the humor. For example: the Terminator arrives in our time naked and arrives at a strip club on ladies' night. He tells a male stripper in a leather jacket outfit to ""take off his clothes"" so he can wear them. When the stripper says, ""Talk to the hand,"" the Terminator grabs his wrist, nearly breaking it in his grip as he does, and puts the hand to his lips as he says, ""Now.""There's even a nice cameo by Earl Boen as Dr. Silberman, and the plot twists are a nice touch (the Terminator Kate sent back to protect her and John in this film reveals the future Kate does so only after it kills John in the future).But nothing beats the shocking twist ending, when John and Kate learn the grim truth about SkyNet.Anyway, there one, confusing flaw that keeps this film from being perfect. John is 23 in this film, and as mentioned before, he was even born in 1985 and was 13 when he last met the Terminator in ""T2"". The film also says Hamilton's Sarah Connor was diagnosed with leukemia after the events of ""T2"", given six months to live but she fought it for 3 years to make sure that on August 29th, 1997, Judgment Day (the day the machines took over) never happened (add to the fact that if ""T2"" WAS set in 1995, that Sarah would've died in 1998 or so, over a year after Judgment Day's date, and you have more confusion).The time-line doesn't make sense. Had it been done correctly, John would've been about 7 in 1992, 13 in 1998 (one year after the original date Judgment Day would have occurred on) and 19 in 2003. It's best to forget the timeline, and if you're new to the ""Terminator"" movies, then this gripe may not bother you so much.Still, despite the fact that I found other films this summer to be either EXTREMELY disappointing (""Hulk"" and ""X2"") or just down-right awful (""Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle"" and ""Pirates of the Caribbean""), ""T3"" was a welcome surprise for me.I yearn to see a ""T4"", in the hopes that Arnold's famous quote of ""I'll be back"" lives up to its promise.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
638,teddeman,T3  The first action movie of the new millennium worth seeing.,9,4 November 2003,"I was lucky enough to get a ticket to the Maryland premier of T3: Rise of the Machines'.  WOW!  This is the best action film since the first Matrix'. Maryland residents, SEE THIS AT THE SENATOR.  It will blow you away.The film works on every level.  Good story, acting, action and just enough humor result in a film that lays the 2nd installment to waste.  I am personally glad that James Cameron passed on this project.  His access to unlimited resources will forever tarnish his filmic vision.  Cameron's version of T3 would have been as bloated and worthless as every movie David Selznick made after Gone With the Wind.'  Jonathan Mostow created a sequel that is true to the original and less than 2 hours long.  
Yes, the budget was huge for T3, but it works and has the most plausible plot of the three films.  After accepting the existence of nearly indestructible terminators, everything else falls into place.  Controlled, limited CGI and muted special effects made every sequence believable (note to the Matrix 2 screenwriters  even though it was really cool, you will never, ever see two tractor trailers worth of Ducatis on the highway at the same time).  The action sequences were not to long (hello Matrix 2 writers). The resulting realism fuels total viewer immersion.  Suspension of disbelief was never pushed too far.  As a result, the audience reacts positively to what was happening on the screen.Less CGI places a greater role on the actors and they did not disappoint. The characters related to each other in a believable manner.  There were no huge plausibility issues (John Conner doesn't send his dad back in time to impregnate his mother a.k.a. T1).  The writers developed a great inevitability of fate' angle to help the story along.  Sarah Conner reaches out from the grave to lend support and the annoying psychologist from the first film returns for a cameo.  The Terminatrix, who attacks with the tenacity and brutality of a woman scorned, is the perfect foe for Arnold. Arnold's one-liners are nicely spaced, a riot and help balance out the insane barrage of destruction the terminators leave in their wake. 
T3 also stands on it's own.  It needs no help from its predecessors (unlike Matrix 3'). The machines rise, as the title suggests, so if there is a T4, it will either be a prequel or take place in the post-human, Skynet world.  There is no need for a prequel as T3 provides a perfect conclusion to the `human-controlled' portion of the saga.  Don't expect a cheesy thumbs-up, into the smelter T2 ending.  The audience I was with applauded the movie as the credits rolled and I was right there clapping along side them.        
Don't cheat yourself.  Find the movie theater near you with biggest screen (the Senator in Baltimore has a 40'one), best sound system (Lucasfilms certified the Senator's THX) and see this movie today!  You will not be disappointed.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
639,nzbungy,Great fun,7,3 July 2003,"I just saw this movie, and had a great time.  Once again, The Terminator is back, along with an extremely hot T-X, played by Kristanna Loken.  Great action scenes, raw violence, and more than adequate acting carry it very well.  Not as original as the first two, but still comes up with creative fight scenes.  A fair amount of amusing dialogue is also present.  Overall, very enjoyable, and quite well made.  I would recommend it to most people, and give it an 8.6 out of 10, or 9 out of 10.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
640,daveshubcaps,The best thing I can say: It Didn't Suck!,7,5 July 2003,"I know that most of us went into the theater with this silent prayer in our minds: ""Please don't suck! PLEASE dont SUCK! PLEASE DON'T SUCK!""First, the good news: It didn't SUCK!Now, the not so good news: It wasn't great either.The best I can do for this movie is say it was pretty good. If it were a stand alone movie, that would be enough. But since it follows two of the best sci-fi movies ever made, it's a bit of a letdown, but not much.This movie is certainly worth watching in the theaters, if for nothing else than the action sequences. Of which there are some doozies! The chase scene with the crane alone is worth the price of admission!The acting in this movie was well done. Being an action flick, I'm not looking for Oscar worthy performances, but I did start to care about these people. Kristanna Lokken did quite well as the T-X, her performance as such rivals that of Robert Patrick as the T-1000 in T2, and she has a nice butt to boot! Nick Stahl fills in quite well as John Connor, though I still would rather have seen Edward Furlong reprise his role and give the film more of a connection to its predecessors. Claire Danes works well too, though her part seems a bit like a redux of Linda Hamilton's Sarah Connor from the first film, even to the point where John Connor says to her in a scene, ""You remind me of my mother!"".Then of course there's Ah-nuld! what can I say? The man was born to play this part! The only problem I had with this rendition of the T-800 (or T-101 in this film) was that for the first 2/3 of the movie, the script relies so heavily on the amusing one-liners (in their defense, they ARE funny!)that the movie threatens to become a parody of itself.Jonathon Mostow does a good job directing, but I really would have liked to have seen what Cameron would have done with this movie. His absence I think is what stops this movie from being great.The biggest gripe I have with this movie is its ending. While it does set up a possible T4 movie, it is anti-climatic to say the least, and furthermore in contradiction to the theme of T2.I give it a 6.5 out of 10.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
641,moviewatcher417,He's back. So what?,3,11 November 2005,"To give you a taste of how I feel about the latest addition to the Terminator franchise, let's have a look at the memorable lines that came out of them.Terminator 1: I'll be back.Terminator 2: Hasta la vista, Baby.Terminator 3: Talk to the hand.There's one of your problems. The first two lines are cool, but the third one is not, just like the movie. It doesn't even come close to measuring up. (the fact that ""Talk to the hand"" conjures up images of Fran Drescher really doesn't help it either) This movie is a very lame descendant of the other two. Everything good about this movie has been done even better in the last two, with the exception of the new villain, who is hotter than a four alarm fire. Nick Stahl and Claire Danes are okay. The problem here is Arnold. Whatever gift he had for playing this role is not here. Instead, he just looks and sounds ridiculous in this movie. Now, as far as the plot is concerned, what happened to the feeling of hope and the message of ""No fate but what we make for ourselves."" It is lost in this film, replaced with ""No matter what we do, we're gonna get screwed by Judgement Day, anyway."" Bottom line: This movie is not a worthy successor to the other two Terminator movies at all.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

Everyone knows that T3 obviously had alot to live up to being the sequel to one of the best movies ever made so the director decided to take no changes and just put together a story as simple as it gets and fill the gaps with action and humor. Which makes an entertainment movie but nothing you will remember, it´s one of those movies that you forget as soon as you walk out of the cinema. Terminator 2 was full of memorable quotes and scenes but T3 is a crap film with a clowninator that does not scare you.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
643,FreedByFiction,This proves there is indeed no fate for the Terminator series.,10,7 July 2003,"When I heard there was to be a Terminator 3, I was kind of excited. Then I heard that James Cameron was not affiliated in any way with the production, and with no Linda Hamilton to boot, and my expectations were pillaged. The trailers (at least the second one) were impressive, but the film was still destined, or had a ""fate"", if you will, for disappointment. On the contrary, the film's fate was not disappointment, but surprise. ""Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines"" is a truly worthy entry in the series. It has a great story, good new characters, and fantastic acting. Nick Stahl, though not resembling Edward Furlong from the second one (but looking a lot like Michael Biehn from T1), is fine as the new John Connor. Claire Danes is also good as a very sudden, yet very important and potent new character. And Arnold is, well, back as Arnold. But thats a good thing. Kristanna Loken is the T-X, a new breed of Terminator, who can shape shift, liquify, and sprout projectile weapons, all in the disguise of a blonde beauty. Needless to say, this element of the story is quite scary. She's actually scarier and nastier than the T-1000. Who would have thought? The movie's written by the guys who wrote David Fincher's ""The Game"" in 1997, a wonderful movie. This gave the production some hope. The film is very, very action packed. Almost relentless. And while it has its dramatic moments, it doesn't compare at all the the emotional impact of ""T2"". But that's fine, being from different people. The fact is, this is a true Terminator movie, and you can call the series a trilogy without a splinter. It binds the story and characters together again. And that's what we really wanted, not James Cameron's name in the credits. 10/10",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

T3 has everything a guy could ask for, hense the title. But where to start, hmmmm...Let's start with Arnold. The original Terminator really puts life into a movie franchise that has been missing for almost 12 years. He really blew the movie away with his incredible acting and even better fighting scenes. The new John Conner, Nick Stahl, may seem like an odd and unknown choice at first, but he is really worthy of the role of Earth's future leader. He really breathed life into the role, plus he didn't sound like a girl when he screamed. Together, Arnold and Nick really make a great onscreen team.But moving on to the main reason the movie was so great, the girls, Claire Daines and , especially, Kristanna Loken, were down right hot. Claire Daines replaces the empty role of the fighting machine that Linda Hamilton was in the first two movies. But even her good looks couldn't compete with Kristanna Loken's sexy killing machine that is the TX. Armed with a multi weapon arm, a shape-shifting body, an inflatable chest, etc. Kristanna really proved that the new female Terminator is nothing to be triffled with.Overall, this movie rocked and is definantly a movie that needs to be seen by any sci-fi or Terminator fan.

645,webmaster-625,the weakest outing for the terminator,3,30 January 2006,"this film lacks 'identity' - is it an action/adventure or a comedy?Arnold Schwarzenegger is still the killing machine, although now he steals biker leathers (terminator protocol dictates that Arnold must ALWAYS wear leathers) from a male stripper who also inadvertently teaches him the phrase ""talk to der hand!"" Old catchphrases are recycled as well - ""SHE'LL be back!"" Arnie observes, having blows the latest anti-terminator terminator through a wall and down an air vent While the pure shock value of seeing a terminator cut its own flesh away is now totally lost, (remember a cinema full of people going ""Ew!!"" when Arnie cut one of his eyes out in the original Terminator movie?) there are still serious moments, as when a woman motorist sees a naked woman (the latest terminator - remember everyone seems to come from the future naked) walking in the street - clearly the motorist has an empathetic moment of what the hell has been done to that poor woman?

Schwarzenegger's presence in an action movie is usually enough for me to like the movie, but for those of you who disagree, there's still plenty of reasons to go see this movie. From beginning to ending this movie is worth watching. The car chase scene is violent and destructive, the way we like it, same for the fight scenes. The writer is careful not to create any inconsistencies caused by the time travel, and references to the other movies and to a (possible?) future seem to be correct. Indeed, this is not just a 2 bit action film script, no, the story by itself makes this movie worth watching. There's some good jokes in the movie, some funny situations, a running gag with sunglasses and Arnold's way of handling oneliners. This all without interfering in other aspects of the movie, as is usually the case in action films.

649,tomas38,T1 and T2 in a blender,6,5 October 2008,"As with the years that passed between the first and second films, the speculation as to whether or not a third film was going to happen at all was very high. We all heard the conflicting statements of both Arnold Schwarzenegger and James Cameron. Finally Cameron said he would do it if 20th Century Fox would release it. Obviously that didn't happen and Arnold changed his mind after saying No. The story of T3 is mediocre to average at best and I'll tell you why. To begin with, a lot of necessary exposition is missing. The writers essentially left out a major plot point with the former Cyberdyne Systems and Miles Dyson. Having a situation where Dyson designs Skynet's hardware and Brewster designs the software would have tied T3 a lot more strongly to the franchise. Another thing is what happens to Sarah Connor. This character has basically been the pennacle of the Terminator mythos. If the reigns have to pass from Sarah to John that's fine. But it would have worked better that we see her killed trying to escape after Skynet comes online. Lastly the concept of The Terminatrix. Now just to be clear, I don't mind a woman being a Terminator. What I do have a problem with is the writers splitting hairs trying to differentiate the T-X from the T-1000. Now we could all see the difference between Arnold and the T-1000. But if the best they can do is showing the T-X endo during a copy, then that won't cut it. There are ways to come up with new concepts on something established. Maybe that's where Cameron could have worked some magic. The only two things that worked for me were Arnold's description of what will happen in the future in terms of the war, and the ending surprised me though. It set up the fourth film pretty well. The missing elements Cameron's nightmarish vision and storytelling smoothness are what crippled this film. Not bad, but could have been better.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

John Connor (Nick Stahl) must once again be protected, this time by not only the Terminatrix, but also from Judgement Day.

The action sequences in the movie are tremendous, showing us all what the reported $170 million budget was used for, especially the chase scene early on in the movie.

While the copies of T1 + T2 were slightly dated, to say the least, both films were absolutely superb, also despite the fact that the effects in T1 were quite primitive compared to today. Nevertheless, T1 remained our favorite not the least because of its very stringent and no-nonsense non-moralistic narrative. T2 was also strong in this aspect, though there were slightly more plot holes and a little too much sentimentality, something which unfortunately plagues many American films. Nonetheless T2 is also great.Then came T3 ... well, a film taste is very individual. Therefore you, dear reader, should not be deterred from going to see this film, despite the fact that my three friends and I all couldn't care less about it.Why didn't we like it? Well, surprisingly we were all in agreement about the lack-of-Cameron-touch as one of the worst failings of the film. The new director does not have the ability to time scenes, events, statement and the narrative anywhere near the brilliant level of Cameron.
Therefore the new director tries to make up for this deficiency in making the car chases and the explosions bigger, the new enemy T-X more deadly, and destruction more extreme. But it all lacks energy, soul and credibility. The narrative is messy and coincidental, as if the director thinks ""now it will be nice to have this scene from a previous Terminator film included and just beefed up"" or ""let's try this - it might be funny"". This unfortunately lets the actors down, leaving them with empty hulls and we couldn't care less if they die or live. This, incidentally, is comparable to the Matrix II and the new Star Wars films. The director believes that he has a good film if he/she can include some cool effects. Doesn't work, though! Furthermore, the scenes lack anything that might even remotely draw the audience into the film. While you can feel the anguish of the humans and the one-mindedness of the robots in the earlier films, this piece of junk left my friends and I with the feeling of ""who cares!"" The first and second Hellraiser movies were absolutely splendid. However, what followed should not ever be mentioned anywhere - especially number three sucked big time and should never bee seen by anybody. Terminator 3 is not so bad that it shouldn't be seen, though. However, it is highly advisable that you lower any expectations - and the lower them again. Then you might enjoy this film. Alternatively wait for the cheap version of the DVD. Finally, if the studio really wants to make a T4, which is highly suggested in T3, then they better get Cameron back on the job. Otherwise they will have just another silly action flick, with no real innovation or originality on their hands, like a gazillion other action flicks from Hollywood - because this is what they have with T3. So unless they rediscover the respect they owe to the great old Terminator-films : Who cares!",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

655,bcorse,The best action movie this year!,9,4 July 2003,"Like many others, my family and I went to this movie expecting to be disappointed.  Instead, we were pleasantly surprised at what turned out to be an excellent story wrapped in some of the most intense action scenes ever filmed.  And yes, Arnold is Back. The ""professional"" reviews have been all over the map on this one, so two words of caution: (1) ignore any review that mentions Arnold's political leanings or ambitions, since they have nothing to do with this film; and (2) dismiss any comment about this being a ""failed franchise"", cause it ain't so! The worst thing that the current creative team could have done was try to out-do or copy T-2:Judgement Day, so they didn't.  Instead they focused on John Connor, now grown up but incredibly paranoid because he doesn't really believe that the future of the world is secure.  Turns out he's right. This is not a James Cameron movie, and in hindsight that's a good thing. This film is completely faithful to what's gone before, but takes us in a new direction which forces John Connor (and us) to finally come to terms with his destiny.  The cast here is excellent:  Claire Danes is exceptional in a role that could have been a drag on the story in less capable hands. And Kristina Lokken as the T-X deserves way more credit that she's getting from some reviewers: I thought she played the role just right, as a cold, heartless killing machine.  The fact that she's an attractive female seems to blind some guys to the fact that there have been very few modern films that show its female leads as anything but conflicted, hapless victim.  Like Robert Patrick in ""T-2"" and Arnold himself, this Terminator is ruthless, deadly and totally dedicated to her mission.  The film's climax wisely harkens back to the first film by stripping away the T-X's outer ""skin"" and revealing the mechanical monster underneath.  This girl is pure evil, just like she's supposed to be. The ending itself is completely unexpected, but quite good.

John and Kate are rescued by an updated T-800 - the T-850. now they must evade the T-X and stop Judgment Day once again.T3 is far better than most people give it credit for. many people site this movie's portrayal of John as one of the main problems - but it only makes sense that John is portrayed as angst-ridden and not as confident as his T2 counterpart, having been told his whole life that he will become the leader of the Resistance, but not happening yet.my only main gripes with this movie are the lack of blue hue James Cameron used in the first 2 films, and minor continuity errors (John saying he was 13 when the T-1000 attacked him, despite T2 clearly showing that he was 10. John saying Cyberdyne was destroyed ""over 10 years ago"", despite T2 taking place in June 1995 and T3 taking place in July 2004. several DVDs and IMDb say that John is 22/23/25, although taking place in 2004 makes John 19).while i would have loved to see Linda Hamilton back as Sarah Connor in this movie, it's never really bothered me all that much. give T3 a chance, it really isn't as bad as people make it out to be. for me it's on par with last year's Terminator: Dark Fate, although for me T3 gets me so full of nostalgia that i'll always see it as my third favourite in the franchise! for me T3 gets a 8.5/10! give it a chance!",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

With out a doubt a masterpiece. But it took more then one viewing to see Mostow's vision.Too much these days people need them to explain a story by words, and dialouge, like your mother telling you a bedtime story. T3 is one of those deeper movies that once you look past the action there are some deep thoughts, and morality issues it talks about. I love where they took the story, and the character's especially John.Thoguh I am mad to know as a huge fan I followed T3 from day one, watched every interview/set report ect. There was about 40 mintues cut from the movie. Including:-10 Minute Future War Sequence.-An Alternate Opening Credits with the T3 song from soundtrack.
-From some people/the book there was a little more of the stripper joint, and the T-850 did more dammage to the bouncer.-A few more scenes like more of the T-850 grabbing his shotgun after running over the T-X.-The T-X killing Liz Anderson a 10 year old girl.-T-X and more of her and the cop like her saying the exact speed she was going.-The T-X going to Bill Anderson's house, and breaking in.-More of the champion crane sequence you can tell easily by the editing.
-Way more talk in the Tundra with John and the T-850 talking about Judgment Day and the upgrades the T-850 has.-A little more of the store scene, the T-850 grabs the glasses.
-More of John talking in the back of the Tundra with Kate.
-Flashbacks of young John and Kate, we could tell from IMDB's young John in the credits early on.-From old set reports and eye witnesses I think the T-850 disabled or maybe even killed cops originaly in the graveyard shoot out because they talked about how he did kill people in that scene long ago.-More of the Graveyard chase, the T-X right behind them and John is shooting at her.-Way more of a slow scene what it was we may never know from the book either the author of the book said he had to change the versions so many times. That is why it was delayed from June to late July because WB changed it so much. But I think there was much more of a slow desert T2 kind of scene between John and Kate and the Terminator. Just more talking.
-So so so much more of the CRS Labs. Showing how the Terminator's survived and Skynet. And all of the early prototypes being made including the 101 from the real human Arnold Sgt. Candy.-Shows how the T-X gets to the CRS labs with the chopper and gets in.
-How Kate/John/T-850 get into CRS, she calls him Uncle Tom. The T-850 shoots some guards in the knee caps.-More of the T-850 talking to General Brewster about the line he said 'I was made here.'-Extened Bathroom sequence where they accually go through the floor.
-You can tell by editing and the book that originaly they had Kate/John fight a T-1 as well, or at least run from it. But they cut it out.
-Shows from pictures that we see the T-X get out of the particle accelerator and she sees the disabled T-850 standing there and she jumps in the chopper. As she saw John/Kate take off.-Now this scene I gathered from set reports and old talks. I think originaly the T-850 came on line and walked across the air strip with the T-1's shooiting everyone and he is in the midst of it all walking to the big chopper. -Way more of the accual 'Rise of the machines' more of the T-1's killing everyone.-Alternate End fight. From set reports and interviews with Stan/Arnold and Larisis or what ever said the same thing I heard. That there was originaly a huge tunnel chase where the T-X in full endo form ran after the T-850/John and Kate. And it was more of a epic battle between the two. Very expensive but cut sadly enough.These were things we either got from set reports ect.There was an alternate end fight, it will be in the DVD/Game it self.
Though it stinks that these cuts were made the movie was still worthy of the franchise. James Cameron thought so, he loved the movie. And we all know James does not just say things to be nice.Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines 9.6/10Highs: Great story, depth, and some serious issues talked about. Great acting and dialouge and ending.Lows: Too much cut, not enough of everything. Lots of the detailed story scenes were cut.Bottom Line: A great film on every level. Not as good as Terminator 2 but I doubt any movie will ever accomplish that. That is a hard feat. But Terminator 3 is one of the best movies I've seen in years, and so worth the long wait.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
659,thestorm_50,Worthy of the Terminator saga. And a smart movie.,10,2 November 2003,"Most general people, and movie goers liked this movie quite a lot and so did I. Anymore we hear a few people online say it sucks, because that is all they can say about any movie any more. And for some reason these negative online nerds some how make people scared of movies or make them say what they want them to say. ""Yea it sucked"" stuff like that. Most of the people that bash T3 contridict themselves time again and again.People whine about how it was too much like T2, then the next sentence they said it was not like Cameron's T2 at all. People are just mad because T3 did not have Cameron.FACT: JAMES CAMERON LOVED THE MOVIE!In July in a BBC interview he said he loved the movie and thought what Mostow did was true to his series and well worthy of his saga.And James has more of a reason to hate it then anyone even more then the most die hard fan.And we all know James is not one for BSing he tells things like it is, he is powerful enough to do that.The movie was made for fan/general audiance. The General movie goer, even the big nerd ones will watch it see and action movie that was good but lacking detail. A true Terminator fan will see all these small details here and there even with in the action, that besides the age mistakes on Sarah and John really fit in to the Terminator saga. Everything that was done in T3 if you look very closley it was said in T1 and T2. Some say how can T3 be, well most fans know that T2 ended with a paradox. If John was still alive, the Terminators/Skynet must still exist due to the fact that Skynet made the Time Displacement Equipment and he sent back Terminator's, then the resistance stole the Time machine and sent Kyle back to protect Sarah from the Terminator then he concived John. So if there are no Terminator's there is no John, some people just don't get that.Story: Not as detailed as the others, but it has more meaning then some see, and really follows what was talked about in T2 and T1, including how Cyberdyne would become part of the military. In T2 the Terminator said ""In three years Skynet will become a huge military supplier."" Well everyone knows T2 takes place in 1995, and 3 years would of been after Judgement Day, so the Terminator always knew that JD would never happen until 2007, or when ever T3 takes place. Very good story. Too bad that the execs took out about 50 minutes of story/character develoment, we will see that in the T3 Ultimate Edition DVD.Visual Effects: Easily the best this year. Yea maybe it does not have as much as Reloaded or LOTR but it has smaller scales, and more realism. Some things people would never guess were CGI until you told them. Including all...thats right ALL even the close up one T-800 endo's in the future scens are all CGI.Sound: Will blow you away. The music was much more human/mechanical instead of Fidel's techno that gets boring. Marco did a wonderful job. And the sound effects in the whole movie will blow you out of the water.Acting: Well done, Stahl was the best in this and the Terminator did a great job as being the T from T1 and T2 combined. Most don't understand that Mostow was trying to de-construct the father figure the Terminator had on John by making him more machine like so that in the future he could fight them more. Kristanna did a great job as a villan. Bravo to all.Editing: Though great I will complain as a huge fan we know there was 50 minutes including a long end fight and 10 minute future war sequence cut out. And a lot of the story scenes left on the floor. I bet if all the scenes were left in T3 would of been hailed as much as T2 by everyone.Bottom Line. T3 was superb, doing what the fans wanted it to do. Making a good ending and not just some yipiee the good guys save the day again ending. A ending that left you quiet and in awe. Making you wonder if we will do something like that some day. T3 was art, it was not verbaly a detailed movie like T1 and T2, it had the detail in between the lines. And if you can filter out the great action, you can see this story and how deep it is. A must see for anyone despite the few nerds bashing it, because they don't understand it.9.6 out of 10",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
660,darkmantis123,Still loving since the 2003!,9,13 May 2020,"I don't understand why everyone hated this movie. Every single one had plot holes and every single one had issues, but to say it wasn't as good as t2 or a flop is just horrible opinion. John came into this movie and decided to make a movie more like the first movie and he did very well in executing the steps. From the very beginning with each introduction of the terminator / human was perfect. All of the fight scenes were great and honestly, Cameron wishes he could top the crane scene! Now don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that this is better than t2, but it's definitely a great action packed movie where you get to feel the pain, stress, excitement and depth of each character. His version of his terminator was very cool and kristana portrayed a very dark terminator. I recently went on a terminatorathon. And even salvation isn't as good as this and the two that followed are complete trash in comparison. Salvation used the same formula but not too much cgi which seems to be the dominant way to go but with high budget series in these mocks you would expect only the best cgi, but. Not in genesys and dark fate. I am 15 minutes into fate and I'm falling asleep. It's like every political statement had to be made and nothing else mattered in it's wokeness.

I'm not a BIG Terminator/Arnie/Clare Danes fan- I enjoyed T2 (didn't actually see T1), but I thought this movie was put together really well. Whilst the focus in T2 was the relationship between the terminator and John, in this movie it was between John And Kate. And to give the actors their dues - I thought Clare played her role really well, she didn't take anything lying down, and she and Nick had a good connection on screen. Spoilers ...I thought she played the role of a future resistance fighter, who is having her life turned upside down, all in one day really well - hell who wouldn't scream, yell and fight back after having your clinic blown up and being chucked in the back of your truck - by two men, one of whom you knew disappeared 10 years ago in dubious circumstances. Nick was great as John Conner, wanting to believe that judgment day is not coming, trying to be optimistic, but never fully letting go of the darker future - I thought he was played with a guarded wariness that seemed to suit the situation. He fought the future, right up until the last moment when he turned off the explosive device.I thought the play on making our own fate and the future being inevitable really interesting. Yes, yes, there are some problems with the time lines - but hey, ITS A MOVIE - enjoy it for what it is .. entertainment, special FX, and interesting storyline.

662,kcirevam,Better than I expected. *Some spoilers*,8,18 July 2003,"Terminator 1. Great movie, scaringly believable plot... setting standards. Time is immutable. The only reason John Conner exists is because SkyNet tried to terminate his mother in the first place. The machines had no way of knowing that, so they tried anyway.Terminator 2. Still a good movie, better action... plot with more holes than a slotted spoon. We change how things happened, so much so that by the end of the movie we are led to believe that the war never happens. In direct contrast to the standards laid out in the first movie.Terminator 3. Better than both it's predesessors. Action ten times better than the first two combined. The plot? Some of you may have missed it hidden way in there behind all that action, but it was there. Not a whole lot of it I admit, but it was there.*Spoilers here* So is time immutable? No. Is time an easy thing to change? No. What happened in T2 was such a huge event that it shook up the future enough to delay Judgement Day for years. We believe that the loop was broken after T2, but instead we find that the loop has simply changed. But now the war's started, now there's no turning back. The resistance will arise, John Conner will lead humanity towards victory... but not before sending the man he knows is his father back in time to his doom. Will it happen differently? Not at first. Not at second either, John will want to make sure it happens the same way. Only this time round, John knows he's going to be killed before the third Terminator is reprogrammed... he'll be ready. SkyNet doesn't know any different.So what happens next? Simple, John wins the war against the machines, we already know this... and the shattered remains of humanity begin anew. But there's a difference. There are probably a many number of events that could unite all of humanity towards a common goal... and that would be one of them. In this new future... we stand united.

666,suntorytime10,He warned us didn't he??!!!,6,19 November 2003,"Movie legacies are a funny thing. Some work because of the structure of the subject matter, some work because of the profit opportunities. But only a few have been able to pull off lasting success. The one's that have not you can usually spot from the phrase `haven't they got anything better to do' upon release of the sixteenth film. The Terminator falls into that category, and although it as seemingly concluded, it's back for a third time. Money talks as they say. Arnold Schwarzenegger returns in one of cinema's most illustrious characters, once again trying to save the world from certain destruction. Judgment Day, the rise of machines, was merely postponed, and now, ten years on, the machines will try again. This time, they have sent there most advanced creation, the T-X (Loken), sexy, sleek and highly affective, to destroy a now adult John Connor (Stahl), and his future wife, Katherine Brewster (Danes). However, the resistance was able to send a lone warrior back through time, the T-101 (Schwarzenegger) to ensure the survival of our young saviours. For a decade, fans were well aware that the Terminator's `father', James Cameron, was not returning. Without him, T3 was never going to be easy. Nevertheless, T3 is, thankfully and surprisingly, damn good. Maintaining the intelligence, compassion, action and multi-layered premise of the first two genre-defining films was always going to be near impossible, but the filmmakers, to their credit, intelligently leave Cameron's oeuvre aside, opting instead for simplicity, which is where the films strength lies. They create a film that keeps the core and shape of the saga, and add enough human emotion, and self-discovery to keep the undertones of the trilogy pulsing, leaving enough room for $170 million worth of SFX, extraordinary chase sequences sci-fi babble, explosions and other action-packed hullabaloo. That's not a bad thing mind you, far from it. The film is a class above your average action flick, and Mostow proves himself quite a deft hand when it comes to action, as well keeping the emotion and drama of the film integral to the film, which he does with trademark poise or flair. As Mostow excels, his cast are something of a mixed bag: on the plus side, Schwarzenegger is again superb, delivering a performance, which is both chilling and extremely tongue in cheek, and newcomer Loken is also impressive as the destructive yet alluring T-X, proving a great foil for Arnie in all departments, and adds a welcome dimension to the trilogy. One the negative side, however, are the young actors: Stahl is badly disjointed, his nice guy persona out of place in the aggressive and loutish role of Connor, and Claire Danes, though at times commendable, is restricted to a clichéd `damsel' role, running around screaming her lungs out and panting loudly.Nevertheless, loud panting noises and nit-picking aside, T3 is really is a treat. Action-packed, funny, beautifully orchestrated, and made with an intelligence sorely lacking from the modern day blockbuster, it's the must see film of the year. And if you don't like it, I think you need your hard drive thoroughly virus checked. ****",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

Whether it is the new director or the actress herself the TX somehow doesn't feel right.And not feeling right is the real problem with T3. The original terminators had something terrifying about them, something dangerous but none of this is present in T3.It is a decent action film that doesn't let you down if you separate it from the other films in its franchise.There is one note to add. The ending is magnificent, beautiful and brave. In my opinion no other pop corn fair that i can think of has ended in such an excellent, thought provoking and visually stark manner.

Why are they sending a robot back into the past when he is grown up? He will probably be more prepared and ready for facing another terminator. I would have sent the new terminator into the past when Sarah Connor was a kid or even earlier when she was being born.What I liked were the old terminators in the movie and Nick Stahl was really great.What I did not like was the stupid sun glasses joke, the action scene in witch the T-101 is hanging on a vehicle which is just the equivalent of the truck chase in part 2, the scene when the T-101 has a malfunction and tries to eliminate John Connor and the entire movie... ... this is just pop corn cinema ignoring the higher needs concerning an intelligent plot for the real fans of the Terminator series.

672,ad-thompson,Not Really Worthy Of Its Predecessors,5,5 March 2007,"When the first 'Terminator' movie was released in 1984, the special effects were not that impressive, but the film had enough low-budget energy, enthusiasm and imagination on show that it made up for what it lacked from the technical aspects. 1991's mega-budget sequel was in many ways similar to the original, but with the wealth of spectacular, ground-breaking special effects on display, nobody really cared. This belated second sequel, however, brings nothing new to the formula other than the addition of a female 'Terminatrix'. The ageing Arnie is no longer the mean, lean fighting machine that was so threatening twenty-odd years ago, looking more like an awkward old relative that just keeps hanging about. Former model Kristanna Loken does a decent job as the 'Terminatrix' (or 'T-X'), although she doesn't really have to do a lot of acting other than looking mean and emotionless. (She looks fantastic, though!). Nick Stahl as John Connor lacks the charisma that Edward Furlong brought to the role in 'T2', but the faithful Claire Danes does a fine job as the love interest, Kate Brewster. The script, though, insistent on giving Arnie a constant stream of one-liners referring back to - or parodying - the previous two movies, only serves to keep reminding us how much better James Cameron's originals were. It does have its moments - there are some spectacular action sequences to be seen - but most of the time it only echoes what we've seen before. It may be worth seeing if you're an avid fan, but in the end it all feels a bit pointless.

Vajna, Hal Lieberman, Joel B. Michaels, Colin Wilson / Music: Marco Beltrami / U.S. Distributor: Warner Brothers The movie T3 (Terminator3) Rise of the Machines is a typical action-movie. Arnold ""Arnie-The Strong-Terminator-Conan-Governator"" Schwarzenegger is the T-101 and his antagonist is Kristanna Loken as the T-X. The T-X is called Terminatrix too. The plot is not very difficult to describe. The T-101 has to protect John Conner (Nick Stahl) and Kate Brewster (Clare Danes) who will be his wife and one of his lieutenants in the future. Ergo, they have to flee from the T-X because the T-101 is an old model. This flight is of course not without any action-sequences. At the end of the film the terminators destroy themselves mutual and the machines take over the world and complete control. John Conner and Kate Brewster can escape in a dugout. Therefore John Conner becomes the leader of the human beings in war against the machines.Terminator3-Rise of the machines is a very good action-movie. There are real stunts and not only computer-animation. This film is really extra-ordinary and absolutely amazing. Arnold Schwarzenegger is the cyber-organism which comes out of the future for a third time. The film is worth watching. There are good special effects and explosions as in other good action-films. The ending of this Terminator-part is very unexpected. It looks like as if there could be a Terminator4. Some say that Schwarzenegger won't be the protagonist in the fourth film, because he is governor. Well, maybe in the fifth film. Somewhere was said that there already exits a script.

677,craig.tuohy,By god they did it!,8,27 June 2003,"I entered last nights screening of Terminator 3 with utter trepidation. No Linda Hamilton, No James Cameron and no skynet. I wasn't sure how they could ever continue the story when Judgement day was avoided at the end of T2.Thank god though, they did it. By the skin of their teeth they managed to convince. It didn't look good at one point. The movie starts fairly drably. Some tired cliché's are rolled out. People's shock at seeing a naked person walking at night, Arnie kicking some ass, leather, sunglasses (with a neat twist). What hits you straight away is that this movie is a product of 'new' hollywood. The camera is shy of any on screen blood letting and manages to cut away just before the rot sets in. While obviously a concession to the censors, it does also have the knock on effect of watering down the brutality of the terminators. You just don't get that sense of ruthlessness that the movie's predecessors had.Unfortunately, the next emotion you get is one of total dissapointment at the new Terminatrix. Her entrance is cringeworthy. I'm not sure how a wooden Terminator is supposed to be scary, but this new villain is so devoid of personality It has the most detrimental effect to the power of the machines. At this point I thought all was lost but from here on out things only get better.We meet John Conner, and it is a very satisfying introduction. John has been permanently scarred by the events in 1991. And has lived a life of solitude and anonymity to avoid being tracked down by any remnants of skynet or the machines. Fat lot of good it did him as fate puts him right back into the path of destruction. And then the chase begins again. And what a chase it is. John hooks up with a girl from his past by means of a plot contrivance that isn't anywhere near as hard to swallow as it probably should be, and they both do a runner together (reluctantly at first) under the protection of the haggered and obsolete T-100. This iteration of John conner (played by Nick Stahl) is very convincing. He looks like a man who has been alone for most of his life. A man who misses his Mother yet resents her at the same time. And when he explains to Claire Danes's character Kate Brewster what is going on, there is a glint in his eye that suggest that although he fears that it is all beginning again, he is quietly satisfied that he maybe isn't crazy after all, and more than that, that he isn't alone anymore.One of the beautiful things about this movie is that Arnie's age, iconic status as 80's action hero and subsequent fall from grace all add up to make him the perfect Terminator for this movie. Hopelessly outdated by the new bells and whistles terminators, past his prime and unloved, the movie sometimes seems like a metaphor for Arnie himself. Seeing him throwing a CGI monster through walls and numerous panes of glass is almost like a the old guard saying ""yes, you have all the fancy gadgets and computer power, but at least we didn't mind getting our hands dirty"". >From the moment the chase begins, it doesn't seem to end. It is action all the way. And boy what action. CGI is used sparingly and cleverly. The show off camera trickery is kept to a minimum and it all has a very old school feel. In fact, it all feels very true to the Terminator universe. Pulsing music rather than full blown orchestrations, mass civil destruction, utter disregard for subtlety, the action scenes in this movie easily stand up to those of any of the other movies. And they seem far less contrived to boot. My only criticism would be that they were all that little bit too familiar. Chases on bikes, trucks, helicopters etc. These are all conventions of the Terminator universe that T3 happily borrows, but the movie seems reluctant to invent any of it's own.The one convention it does try to instill, or maybe develop from T2 is morality. There are scenes where the Terminator is forced to make Moral choices and show traces of humanity. While some in the cinema found this all a bit ridiculous, I actually found it fairly touching and a nice addition to the story. Arnie's internal struggle almost seeming more than that of circuitry and processing power.About the story. It's the strongest of the 3. By all rights it should be laughed right out of town, but they actually get away with it. The existence of skynet and the rise of the machines is brilliantly explained using some very clever twists and reflections of current society. In fact, I would like to have seen more of this side of the plot. It is only there to facilitate the action set pieces but it had enough weight to carry the movie into more philosophical territory, rather than just another (albeit very good) chase movie.There are faults with the movie. I kept waiting for an explanation to why exactly the newest Terminator is a woman. Something about it being easy for her to infiltrate the very male dominated society of the future, or mans one weakness being their libido. Anything would have sufficed and the material could have used some philosophising on mans weakness to the opposite sex being it's biggest downfall in the war against the sexless machines. Alas, no such reasoning is given. It is just accepted and john Conner refers to her as 'The Terminatrix' as if she is an old family member. Also, as the arch villain, she just simply is not very menacing. Partly due to woeful acting and a script that is wholly recycled from Robert Patricks turn in T2, but also partly due to the fact that she is actually a bit.rubbish. Why, after the liquid metal killing machine of 1991 do the machines go back to making an exo-skeleton robot? It simply makes no sense. She seems like a model way down the evolutionary chain from the T1000. Even her flamethrower hand is far from intimidating and more reminiscent of the teachers in the B-movie schlockfest 'Class of 1999'.. Also, humour. Arnie has too many one liners. The Terminators are a girly girl and a stand up comedian. How scared do are we supposed to be? We want ruthles, not sexy and cute.Also, if I have to see another secret underground base in a movie I'm gonna shoot someone. Hoolywood take note. Audiences aren't impressed with styrofoam rocks and banks of flashing lights. Setting the final act on a dodgy set with bad Doctor Who style robots will impress noone. Just once I want to see a movie like this end in a big tropical forest or a desert. Anywehere that doesn't have a self destruct sequence and really annoying alarms.Other faults include plot goofs that make certain meetings and situations unbelievable. For example, Claire Danes's character has to go to her place of work at an ungodly hour in the morning, whereby the Terminatrix shows up to execute her. But why would the Terminatrix go there in the middle of the night when her target is not supposed to be there?But all these are small niggles swept under the carpet by the majesty of the denoument. I won't ruin it, but the ending is ballsy, jaw dropping and unexpected. Not only that but it does 100% justice to the integrity of the series. It marks the end of a chapter and it does it in style. They could never make another Terminator movie and the trilogy would go down in history with the Star Wars' and the Die Hard's (as apposed to the Alien's and Jaws'), or they could make another and take it in a whole new direction. It is a truly great ending. Not just satisfying and fitting, but great. The kind of ending people will talk about in 10 years time.I'm very happy to report that the story is what makes this movie work. Which makes a surprising change for a summer blockbuster. I had very little faith in this movie, but it sits proudly alongside the first two to make one of the best action trilogy's in hollywoods pantheon. What a relief.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
678,arkanis50,"A reasonably fitting end to the series, or a vision of things to come?",8,18 August 2003,"Terminator 3 was nothing short of a thrill-ride of explosions, over-the-top action and fun - although after three movies I am finding the Terminator series getting very repetitive. Is it just me, or does it seem like a member of the resistance comes back to protect John Connor/Sarah Connor, the machines send back a Terminator to take them out - we see some fights and bingo-bango, a couple hours later it is all resolved?I felt Terminator 3 lacked the look and feel of the classic Terminator 2, and often bordered on unintentionally comical scenes. I had to laugh at some of the fight scenes between The Terminator and the T-X, which seemed like some sort of CGI bad dream. On the opposite side of the coin, the scenes throughout the movie which were supposed to be comical, felt very cheesy and tacked-on, i.e. the Elton John glasses.That aside, Terminator 3 was packed full of what Arnie movies do best - fights, chases and s*** getting blown up. The car chase scene involving the crane was great, and as far as I am concerned was better than The Matrix Reloaded's attempt at a car chase any day. The T-X, played by very cute Kristanna Loken, brought a freshness to her role as the 'Anti-Terminator' Terminator. The T-X seems to take the best of the Terminator and the T-1000, and chucks in some extra firepower for added effectiveness.Terminator 3 might not add as much to the overall story as possibly Terminator 2, but it will fill a lot of holes, expand on some of the concepts hinted at in previous movies and tie up some loose ends in the series. You will learn more about John Connor's future, Skynet, Judgement Day, and the future of mankind's battle against the machines.As for the ending? Well I thought it was a very interesting and thought-provoking way to end the movie, and possibly the series. Although given Hollywood, I would imagine there will probably be at least one or two more movies. With or without Arnold, the series surely must move away from the ""send back a Terminator to kill John, and they send one to protect him"" style, and take us to the future where John Connor takes control of the resistance.I give T3 an 8/10.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

You can unplug from reality and ride the rollercoaster of thrills that this film provides. Then you can quickly forget it and go about your business.The story nicely explains away why everything isn't honkey-dorey after John and his mom averted Judgement Day.  I still wonder why John Connor of the future can't send a newer model to save his younger self, but... the film is popcorn for the mind and candy for the eyes.

680,exeverywhere,the right notes,8,5 August 2003,"Though not any kind of masterpiece, T3 brings an effective closure to the trilogy (let us pray that T4 never happens) and was a better movie than I thought it would be.The scope is on the slightly more human scale of the first movie. Of course there are obscene levels of stunts and special effects, but what drew me in was that the notions of fate and consequence were dealt with in a more  - dare I use the word - realistic manner. The sheer terror of the first movie and the operatic melodrama of the second have been brought down to a more plausible scale. One gets more of the feeling that the two human principles are real people. Their flaws are not gigantic tragic flaws, but real qualities of fear, bravery, uncertainty, and shock. This gives more drama and entertainment in their interactions with the two machines.For it's back to basics philosophy and high entertainment value I give it a solid 8/10.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

I've beendefending T3 for months now in arguments with annoying Matrix fanboysand others who refused to believe it possible that Arnold had anothergood film in him... but deep inside of me there was that lingeringdoubt... could T3, without Jim Cameron's direction, without BradFiedel's score, and without Linda Hamilton or Edward Furlong... be agood film?  The answer for me and those in attendance (includingnumerous T3 bashers) was a resounding YES!!!I got my hopes WAY up for this movie, and I think for the first timesince I saw True Lies in 1994 (with high expectations) a movie actuallydelivered on its promise.  This is not just a mindless action film. This is not ""heartless"" (as I've heard some critics say).  This is oneof the most suspenseful, emotional, gargantuan action setpieces in thehistory of cinema.  That may sound ridiculous, but it's the truth.  Ifyou walk out of the theater disappointed with this film, I'll tellya... I can't think of much that would entertain you.  I think thatsomeone would have to be dead to not enjoy this movie.That having been said, I don't know where I would place this film(rank-wise) in the terminator series.  Suffice it to say that on ascale of four stars, I would give each film five.  Thank you JonathanMostow... thank you Arnold... it has been far too long since an actionmovie of this caliber has been released.

683,estern,Fantastic Action/Sci-Fi Film,10,31 July 2003,"I wrote a comment earlier on this film and feel compelled to write another. I really love this movie.  I can understand the people who say that it isn't as good as T1 or T2 and what have you, but who can honestly say that Arnold has made a better film than T3 since his last collaboration with James Cameron?  Seriously, folks... True Lies was released 9 years ago!  T3 breaks the string of bad/mediocre Arnold flics.Some people have really gotten onto the screenwriters for T3.  News Flash: T3 was as inevitable as is the human race eventually destroying itself.  The writers did what they absolutely HAD to do to have the series make sense. T3 did not render the previous time travel philosophies of T1 and T2 irrelevent.  T1 said that time was cyclical.  T2 said that some things can be changed.  T3 said that some things can't.  How does T3 conflict with T1 and T2?  Simple answer is it doesn't.  It simply says that some things no matter how much you want them to, cannot change.  Destiny.  There may be no fate but what we make, only within the confines of a certain set of rules.In sum, T3 is a great film.  But for the comparisons to T1 and T2, I would say it's near flawless.  I think that the people who are criticizing this would be best off going back to watching such masterpieces of cinema as the Bridges of Madison County and Divine Secrets of the Ya Ya Sisterhood.  As Arnold says on the commentary track of Conan the Barbarian, ""if you believe that (people who like those movies would like T3) you also believe that there're Richard Simmons Jr's running around!""",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

I was expecting a poor movie due to the lack of buzz, but I was very pleasantly surprised to finally see a worthwhile action movie this year.  I'm not a big fan of sequels, but this one took the series in a totally different direction.  Don't get me wrong - I'm a huge fan of what Cameron did with the first two.  Those who expect to see more of the same style will be disappointed.  Go in with an open mind and you will be delighted.  Claire Danes is good and the 'Terminatrix' is awesome.

685,ozzmosiz,A great second sequel,7,31 July 2003,"After watching T3 for the first time I thought I would write up my review.
T3 kicks off with an introduction by John Conner describing the way he has lived his life since the last installment, this sets up the story without having to reintroduce his character. This allows the action to flow, and boy does it come at you non-stop, watch out for the street chase, unlike another film that I will not mention, the stunts were actually done for real. T1 was an awe-inspiring concept of a story and held no punches with the violence. T2 was an epical science fiction special/visual effects extravaganza. T3 tends to fall in between in terms of violence and visual/special effects with a hint more humour than T3, most of it blatant.The length of the film is shorter than its predecessor to ensure the film never lets up. The storyline is similar to T2 but has other elements added in to ensure that is also interesting.Overall it's a fantastic film in my opinion, it does differ to the other two installments, but this helps to ensure that things don't become stale, although it does fall slightly short of T2 but not much.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
686,mysticzine,"Fun,if generic action flick",6,2 July 2003,"Well, it didn't suck....much...Without James Cameron, there really can be no true Terminator film. The absence of Linda Hamilton is greatly felt, too. However, what we do get isn't that bad. This is definitely a more generic version of terminator. There's not much character development, there's no real message, and it doesn't really feel as much as an event as the previous two. The computer graphics that set T2 apart (and above) other action flicks have given way to the standard morphing/crashing/people getting thrown all over the place CGI.

As a film based on some kind of story:  hardly entertaining.It's always good when a sequel can stand alone as a story, but T3 would fail (miserably) to do so.  T3 is more of an extended ending to T2, as no effort is made to really set the scene in this movie.  Instead, T3 relies on its previous incarnations for any understanding of what is happening or why.  As almost everything is recycled, and the only surprise isthe not exceptionally optimistic end, the Who Cares factorkills the terminators deader than they already are.So hey, the cars go boom boom nicely.  The robots menace. Claire Danes looks less interesting than she would in a 30 second commercial.  See it because the action is decent.

The plot, if one call it  that, is flimsy, full of holes, and guaranteed to enable the production of yet another sequel.  Finally, it is evident that the film sets and paraphernalia were generated on the cheap.This film is very bad, and a grand disappointment.

690,bdotson,It's just a movie,3,1 July 2003,"Uhgg. Where do I start? I watched T3 last night. Now, I'm a HUGE fan of the first two. They are amazing films that still hold up after multiple viewings. In, fact, last weekend I watched The Terminator and T2 in preparation for my viewing of T3. Perhaps director Jonathan Mostow should have watched them before he began filming, because he apparantly has never seen them.I absolutely refuse to acknowledge T3 as part of the storyline. T3 is bad. I mean, Highlander 2 bad. Not only was the storyline bad, but so was the filmmaking. This mess was just a bunch of action scenes very loosely strung together by a thin story. What made the first two movies so good? The Action? No. The Effects? No. Certainly the action and effects did give those films another level of enjoyment, but what made them good was the story. T3 seems to think if you have action and special effects, you don't need a story. Well, without a story, you have garbage.SPOILERS WITHIN T3 is full of unexplained scenes. In fact, some scenes actually jump to different geographical locations without ever explaining how the characters got there. (For example- John, Kate, The Terminator and The TX all show up in a high security military installation without ever explaining how they got there.) The characters seem to randomly show up whenever it's time to have an action scene. Hey, who needs a plot. We've got stuff to blow up!There are severe inconsistencies from the other two films. Taking what we know, the first Terminator takes place in 1984. John Conner's voice over dialogue at the beginning of T3 specifically states that he was 13 during the events of T2. Now, assuming John was born in '84, or '85, that would place T2 in the year 1997, obviously before August, because, as we know, that's when Judgement Day is. In T3, Sarah Conner's gravesite places her year of death in 1997. John explains that she died from leukiemia, exactly three years after she was diagnosed. Since she was diagnosed after the events of T2, well, then, her death should have been around the year 2000. Apparantly, the writers can't count.The Terminator from T3 has specific traits that the Terminator from T2 developed (example-finding car keys in the visor) how is that possible if he's a different terminator?T1 and T2 both follow a very specific time travel philosphy. T3 completely ignores the rules of time travel that were layed out in the first two films. T3 complety screws up the time line.The music flat out sucks. The music in the first two films were very important components. Brad Fiedel's music is absent from T3, and the music they did use is awful.T3 just doesn't fit. It's not consistant with the other two. The look is different, the music is different, and the story is different. It just doesn't belong.I know what you're saying. ""It's just a movie"". You're right. T3 is ""just"" a movie- and that's exactly what's wrong with it. T1 and T2 weren't just movies. They were something more. And if you're going to continue something of that magnitude, you'd better do a good job. Jonathan Mostow has failed. All he succeeded in doing is making another shallow Hollywood action movie. Jonathan Mostow, you should be ashamed of yourself.(James Cameron, if you're reading this, you have my permission to kick him right in the shins. Your creation has been disrespected and ruined, and I am sad.)My advice, skip this movie altogether and watch the first two again.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
691,stevenp61,Spoilers!!!!!!! My Review,10,2 July 2003,This is my full review of T3:rise of the machines i just saw this movie about a half hour ago.I must say that i had doubts when i went into the theatres that this movie was not going to be as good as the first 2 one main reason is that James Camerons name is nowhere to be found but i must say i was pleasently surprised with the outcome.T3 has action and lots of from the crane chase to the end of the movie it is a non stop thrill ride complete with the humor and gore.Oh and don't forget the best part of this movie the story it has a great one and i  must say this movie was not just mad for the sake of making a sequel they took great care in coming up with the plot (thats why it took 12 years)to make the film.On to the next part of my review which is the acting.The acting is very good from Nick stahl to Clair Danes it is on par with the amount that is required to do a movie like this.The Cgi flawless i thought it is the best and most realistic i have seen so far this year it is used sparingly and sometimes u never even know that its there.The Direction i know it is no James Cameron but it still is a accomplisment to take on a burden this much and then pull it off as much as Jonathon Mostow has.good jobThe Music the one thing i hate about this movie no  use of the original theme only at the end but still has an ok score.The Story on par with the rest of the series and has its place within the terminator construct.Well done and i look forword to the next one.The script very good explains whats going on very well the only thing that sucks is the comedy to much in a film franchise that focused on taking itself seriously.Final word good addition to the best trilogy ever yes there are some bad things about it but they are overuled by the good things a good sequel and i hope they mke a T4 before Arnold gets old.Oh and don't forget the T-X great entertainmentAll in all BEST MOVIE OF THE SERIES AND THE SUMMER!!!!!!!9/10,Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
692,andibert,"Boring, boring, boring",3,11 September 2003,"Before watching this movie (which I was quite much looking forward to) I watched the first parts of the ""trilogy"" once again to dive into the great dark-futuristic scenario to be able to get this movie the right way. I am not saying that the predecessors were great movies in a sense of intellectually or artistically qualitative films, but they created a really impressive atmosphere and were just good entertainment.This movie is different. The whole background is taken from the older movies, no new ideas. Just action. Action, action, action. All the time. Man, how I was bored. I admit, the special effects were good, but you can't save a movie just with that. The dialogues (the few that there are) are really embarassing, both for the actors (especially Arnold S. who once again shows that he did NOT become famous for his skills as an actor, but for his unvoluntary comic) and for the spectators.If you really want to watch this movie, I recommend that you don't do it without several beers and a good company you can discuss how bad with how bad it was afterwards.

695,jatinder377,Overall a let down,6,11 March 2009,"When I first saw the trailer for T3 I must admit I was excited, judging by the special effects and the action scenes I thought that this would be a good addition to the series.However after watching the film I must admit I felt overall let down, the film just like Arnie felt old. Majority of the action scenes were good but the film just lacked something, when compared to T2. Even though T2 was made many years earlier the special effects still looked better then this film (except the one scene with Arnie at the end), and also it lacked the darkness, and suspense of the previous films I felt one of the biggest criticism of the film was that the t101 was completely out classed by the new terminator and so you really felt that in every action scene they were going to loose. At least in T2 you felt Arnie had a chance but there was never that feeling in this film. I do realise to some people this might be stupid but the confrontation between the new terminator and Arnie just felt wrong because we all knew Arnie was going to have his a** kicked Also even though Arnie had worked out to get into shape for this film he still looked to clunky and slow (if you can understand that) and I think that made the film less enjoyable overall. You never really felt that Arnie was a terminator just a out dated machine, in T2 Arnie looked (excuse the expression) cool, the scene where he was on the motorbike shooting at the T1000 was awesome but there were no such scenes in this film.Having a female as the terminator was also wrong, it did not feel right in this film There was also to much humour in this film (probably to give the 12a rating) and that was completely unnecessary, who on earth thought that putting Arnie in purple star shaped sunglasses was a good idea!!!!!!!!!! This really did ruin the film because you could never take Arnie seriously after that John Conner was poor as well, in T2 he showed courage and leadership but here he just looked like a wimp you never really believed that this person could be the saviour of humanity, I don't believe this was the actors fault more the direction of the film that made him into this charhachter I do realise I have criticised this film considerably but it's just after seeing T2 and how awesome that was this film did not even come close, however as a stand alone film it is good but if compared to the previous films it then just looks old and outdated",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

Kristanna Loken builds upon Robert Patric's emotionless killer T1000, and makes the T-X one of the best evil nemesis's ever.  Arnie looks great.  Other than the story, the thing that really stands out is the effects.

698,axlroseisgod,An new action movie with old school sensibilities,10,8 July 2003,"Modern filmmakers often try to create cinematic events which work on multiple levels. However, in order for a movie to be good, it must first succeed on a superficial level. This is where Matrix Reloaded failed. Reloaded, at its most profound, tried to engage the viewers in philosophical debate. But on the surface, Reloaded was nothing more than MTV style and sensibilities. Ultimately, Reloaded can be summed up in one word: Techno. Perhaps, that's slightly unfair, but it's less unfair than writing The Crow off as a goth movie. But enough about OTHER movies.Terminator 3 is a movie that does work on that basic level. It's absolutely entertaining to watch. The action scenes are more thrilling than anything that Hollywood has offered up so far in 2003. The plot is decent too. Even without James Cameron, the T3 managed to make a decent movie. Cameron has described T3 as ""great"", so the movie is clearly not an affront to the first two movies. If you liked Arnold in T2, you'll like him in T3. The reprogrammed, slightly outdated T-101 is as good as ever. Nick Stahl gives a good performances as the paranoid disillusioned 20-something junkie John Connor. Claire Danes also does well as Kate Brewster, a veterinarian thrown into a situation that's out of her control. Kristanna Loken does as well as she can with the T-X role. T-X isn't anywhere near as ruthless as Robert Patrick's T-1000, but she's far more effective at keeping her targets in her sites.Some people have said there's too much humor in T3. I disagree. Every action movie has its fair share of levity. The epic T2 had John Connor teaching the Terminator to say thinsg like ""eat me, d***wad"" as well explaining to him that he couldn't just kill people.Another complaint is that the plot is too thin. I disagree wholeheartedly with this. Director Johnathan Mostow and the writers don't beat you over the head with the motivation of the characters, they leave some of that open to you. Not every movie is gonna hold your hand and walk you step by step through a detailed explanation of things. Some things you just need to accept, or interpret for yourself. After all, this IS science fiction/action. However, there is one mind boggling scene where the T-X inexplicably escapes from a magnetic field. This is the only major flaw with the movie.Perhaps the one main drawback to T3 is that if you haven't seen the prequels, especially T2, then you may not understand some of the finer points of the movie. But if you haven't seen T2, you have no business watching any sci-fi/action movies anyway.T3 has a great ending, but they inevitably leave it open for another sequel. I really hope there isn't a T4. No series has ever passed the 3 movie and remained great or even good.T3 will never be as good as T2, but it's a valiant effort. I've tried not to talk too much about the plot; that's not the purpose of a review. If you want to know why the events in T2 didn't prevent Judgment Day, you'll have to go see T3 for yourself.I'm not here to ruin the movie. If you're a fan of Arnold, Terminator, or action movies, go see T3. It's a whole lot of fun and action from start to finish. And it fits seamlessly into the series progression.Overall rating: 3.5 out of 4 stars",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
699,johnsaucier1977,Great movie!,10,7 July 2003,"I went into this expecting a decent movie, and was pleasantly surprised. Nick Stahl replaces Edward Furlong as the John Connor, who is now a man, with a destiny. I think Nick Stahl did a good job as John Connor and was completely believable. Claire Danes does the best job in this movie in my opinion as Kate Brewster, a future lieutenant and wife to John Connor. She has this amazing charisma about her and I enjoyed watching her on the screen. Arnold Schwarzenegger reprises his role as the T-101 (NOT T-800 like the Plot outline says, jeez get it right!) terminator, now obsolete. I wasn't a big fan of some of the one-liners he used but it was a decent performance in spite of it. Kristanna Loken plays the new T-X terminator. Now although she has very few lines, her face speaks in great detail. Earl Boen also reprises his role as Dr. Silberman in a quick spot, which I found to be very funny.Now as far as the movie goes I think this was more funny than the previous versions but it still maintain its action/thriller appeal. It was suspenseful when it needed to be and that was very important. And I think the last thirty minutes of this movie were really quite good and thought provoking. The end really came too soon, which was my only disappointment. I don't really enjoy movies which try to stick too much information in too little time, as this movie does. However its done well enough that you do not become bored or puzzled at some of the things that happen. However my only problem is this film really should have been longer. I think had they had another twenty or thirty minutes we could have seen a little more story. The movie seems more concerned with the action than the dialog which doesn't quite turn me off, though I would have liked to see more. My hope is that the DVD will include much more that was cut from the film. And I think while deleted scenes are good, I'm much more on the special editions where the cuts are seamlessly added to the theatrical release. In any case this movie is good, and can only get better with more scenes. I for one am wishing and waiting for a fourth installment.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
700,leroux,"""Forget everything you thought before, your looking at a trilogy"" - Randy Meeks, Scream 3",7,20 September 2003,"In T3 the new rule laid out in Scream 3 was brought into play, and I couldn't have enjoyed it more. T2 has been one of if not my favourite movies since I was a little kid and I had been looking forward to T3 since then aswell.The story was well written and paced good, the dialogue is a bit on the weak side, but still pretty solid. Every performance in the film was done well enough with the only exceptions being a few of the bit characters.Visually the film is absolutly stunning, the effects all look very crisp, clean and natural which is something of a rare quality in the bullettime style of today.Mostow gave a great effort directing this, personally I feel that Cameron couldn't have come close to pulling this off as he likes to focus his directing projects moreso on the story and actor's delivery of dialogue. Mostow's previous works show that his films have the perfect action and dialogue balance with his projects.Now, into some depth with the story. My only major complaints with the story is definetly just how well the John and Kate characters' pasts connect. It just seemed too cliched, with the whole ""lovers from the past reunite"" crap from the basic chick flick formula.Sypnosis: If your looking for some deep story here, don't. T3 is just an action packed visually spectacular film to see. It takes the first 2 films in the story and continues the progression (T1 - Drama with action overtones. T2 - action with dramatic overtones. T3 - action) of the series, essentially showing what any future Arnoldless sequels will be like. I really enjoyed the film, and am again hoping for another Terminator movie.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
701,mikemillertime,T3 is way sweet!,9,2 July 2003,"Dude, this movie lives up to the Terminator heritage. In every regard, it ups the ante on classic themes and sequences from the last 2 movies. Even without Cameron, the movie has the same end-of-the-world urgency that made the other two better than the sum of their explosions. The same time-travel/ apocalypse ideas remain well intact and properly advanced. The new chick Terminator is highly evolved from the last with several new tricks and gizmos, and Arnold is completely vintage in his deadpan ass-whoopin'.  From an action junkie perspective, there are quite a few parts that max out on damage and gunfire. There's plenty of scenes not even hinted at in the trailer, so you will be intrigued by some of the various developments and moments throughout the film.

702,Europe86,Future is closer than we think.,9,13 December 2003,"I find ""T3:Rise of the Machines"" to be as good as ""T2:the Judgement Day"" and way better than the original ""Terminator"". It is a bit funny as well and I do like the end of it. Afterall, not every movie has to have a good ending, right? I admit, I didn't see it coming. But it has a few flaws. One of them is the dialogue. That could have been done better. There were few other visible mistakes throughout the movie. I think they should stick with Eddie Furlong as John Connor. He was better in his role than Nick Stahl. And I think, in the opening part of the movie where they show John Connor as the leader of the resistance, Nick Stahl's make-up is done rather poorly. It is a sci-fi movie, but it is more real than we realize. True, when the original movie was made 20 years ago, it was all sci-fi, but now... what happened at the end may not be far fetched as we would like to think. Considering how our techology has developed, how the nuclear programs and war fare have advanced.......and how the things stand right now in the world....the future could be closer than we think.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

Thanks to a ridiculous story, poor actors like John Connor (Nick Stahl) and his friends which look like directly taken out of a levis commercial, a female Terminator that reminds me of cheap erotic action comics, and Arnold Schwarzenegger ready for the wheelchair. This is one of the cinema movies you really regret you payed for. Or in one word, this flick is dumb in every aspect.Terminator 1 and 2 were really good flicks with a intelligent story.

705,zachlong-400-148221,Disappointing Sequel to the First Terminators,4,8 March 2013,2/4The first two Terminator movies could be called some of the best sci-fi action films ever to be created. The plot and character development was great. They took times to slow down and in a way really impact the characters.But now the sequel to the second one seemed to be nothing more than just a hyped up action film. The movie was a pretty short one but that's only because it had not much time to cool down after all the action sequences.Even though there are a lot of action scenes they don't seem very enjoyable or amazing like the first ones which really kept you interested. The first two films had a kind of different styles of action from each other. There wasn't much hand to hand combat in the first but had amazing shootouts and suspenseful parts. The second had more like stunts and hand to hand combat scenes with both terminators. But the third tries to use both too much and over does it. This can overwhelm the film and become bored if this is all the movie has.,Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
706,ericwatkinson,Look Again - There Are Different Levels To This Film,7,18 August 2015,"I honestly don't understand how so many people can claim to dislike Rise of the Machines, so much, and sometimes I wonder if people are attempting to trash this film, just to show how smart and sophisticated they think they are? To begin with, the CGI special effects found in Terminator 3 are superior to those found in the following two films, and if you're not sure about that, all you need to do is compare the sequence in which the Terminatrix flips the big boom truck in Terminator 3, to the school bus accident scene in Terminator 5. In Terminator 3 we get to see paint fall off as sheet-metal buckles, a wheel falls off the truck in slow motion along with the broken wheel studs, and the frame of the boom truck bends and collapses in a completely believable manner. However, in Terminator 5, the school bus appears to inexplicably twirl and pirouette all over the Golden Gate Bridge, as if the laws of physics have somehow magically been repealed, yet at the same time the passenger compartment of the bus seems to ridiculously stay intact as the bus violently flips, and none of the main characters sustain any noteworthy injuries, or are thrown from the bus! One of the other things that also makes Terminator 3 such a great film is the believability of the characters. When the Terminatrix rips the door off of Katheryn Brewster's truck, Claire Danes uses her considerable acting skills to make you believe that she is as terrified out of her mind as a real person would be under those circumstances! (Nothing like that happens in the following films.) Also, in Terminator 3 the character of John Connor is so far from the gruff talking cutout superheroes found in Terminators 4 & 5, that he is actually so overcome with despair twice in the film, that the Terminator must intervene in order to prevent him from killing himself. Nick Stahl does a passable job of portraying John Connor as deep-seated loner with a lot of personal flaws, and the John Connor character found in Terminator 3 in light years beyond the cardboard John Connor character found in Terminators 4 & 5! It's not Shakespeare, but I think that a lot of people are missing important aspects of this film, and while your watching it, pay attention to the physics found in the CGI effects.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

708,poetess1558,A real letdown (possible spoilers),4,2 July 2003,"I adored the first two Terminator movies.  I saw the first one 10 years ago, and the second one a little while later.  I was excited at first, but had a couple misgivings.  I knew from the beginning that Linda Hamilton wouldn't be in T3, and that John Connor would be played by someone else.  I should have followed my gut and not seen this.Nothing is explained in this movie, like what the T-X was made of, exactly. There was, I guess, a need for a sequel, because the first two movies created a paradox.  If they really had stopped Judgment Day, they couldn't have done it.  That is, if in T2 they stopped it, there would be no terminators, no reason to send Kyle Reese through time in the first movie, no John Connor, no damaged CPU to build Skynet on--you get the idea.  If they had really stopped the future, John Connor couldn't exist and Sarah Connor would still be working as a waitress.  What I don't get is why the terminators got sent back in the first place.  Obviously, the reason they got sent back was because John Connor was there.  Since he was there, didn't that mean they failed in the first place, so sending back machines was useless?  Anyway...Back to the movie.  Yes, there were some great action sequences, but all it really did was illustrate (badly) what had to happen anyway, if you just thought about it.  It's a great movie franchise, but it's built on absolute impossibilities, not just pretend A.I.I'd give this movie a 4 out of 10.  IF YOU LIKED THE FIRST TWO, STAY AWAY FROM THIS ONE!!!!",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
709,craig44-1,almost as good as the original,9,9 January 2007,"The first ""Terminator"" is still the best, but T-3 is a very good sequel.Terminator-2 lost much of the frantic pace of the first movie. the Terminator villain played by Robert Patrick was just not menacing enough for my taste.Linda Hamilton ruined her character by shedding the terror and eventual quiet courage she displayed in the first movie.In T-3, Linda Hamilton is absent and John Connor is now an adult living ""off the grid"" in order to hide from any new Terminators sent from the future.Nick Stahl does a good job replacing Edward Furlong in the role of John Connor.Stahl plays John Connor as a reluctant hero, who tries to avoid his inevitable fate, until the very end of the movie.Arnold Swarzeneggar will never be a great actor, but he IS ""The Terminator"".Arnolds robotic, monotone delivery is often hilarious in T-3.

Johnathon Mostow (U-571) takes over James Camerons goliath franchise bringing freshness to the table, and as James is missed, Mostow does a stand up job of continuing the ongoing saga of John Conner and his acceptence of fate.
Marco Beltrami takes over Brad Fiedel and although he does a good job, duplicating the creepy music of the T-1000 for the T-X with some added flair, Fiedels theme is tossed aside until the end credits which is a shame.over a solid film that will be sure to surprise the naysayers as this Terminator, a shorter, leaner terminator than T2, is an amazing tale.9/10",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

At that point, it recycles a lot from the previous movies, though in fairness, trying to be funny.  It was cute - but, well, it was not that funny.The script for the play was likely the first draft on a napking of the treatment.  Very thin, probably a few pages long.  The story, very linear and predictable.  While the new terminator is sexy-scary, we are never in actual fear for the lives of our heros or the success of thier mission.  The ending twist was nice, but too late to save the film.There was not any 'wow' in new special effects or action sequences like there was seeing T2 - so there was some dissapointment there.

714,TheEnigmaticMrKurtz,"As good as T2, but great in it's own right",9,1 July 2003,"Jonathan Mostow has done what some call impossible: he has matched the direction of James Cameron in Cameron's own series. Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is an amazing visual spectacle as well as a story driven film. Mostow stages some amazing combat sequences, and Arnold is on top of his game in the role that made him famous. The script is well written, with classic Schwarzenegger one lines, and the repetition of the line ""She'll be back"" actually works. The movie is peppered with humor and smart dialogue. The story actually makes sense in the timeline, although taking some liberties. Instead of a vote of 10 the reason this film gets a 9 by me is that the action sometimes seems to take center stage, although it drives the story along. One scene comes to mind when the T-850 drives a truck through a wall, suddenly fuel barrels explode. The Terminatrix is an imposing villain, definitely a great screen character. Kristanna Loken's icy blue eyes truly make the T-X a menacing villain that you grow to hate. Nick Stahl plays John Connor as he should be; a boy who knows what he's destined to do but questions why he was chosen, and resents it every minute of his life. Overall the action and script are great, the direction is excellent, and Arnold breaks the slump of bad movies. Definitely a worthy sequel to a great franchise, unlike the disappointing Matrix Reloaded. No T4!!!(You'll understand when you see the movie, especially the ending)",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
715,SilverCentri2009,So much potential that went unfulfilled,5,18 April 2020,"Since I first saw this movie in theaters back in the summer of 2003, I've had mixed feelings about it since then. For many years, I thought it was great, not as good as the first two, but good enough on its own. Granted, when I first saw it, I had only recently watched the original two films so I was not a hardcore fan of the Terminator franchise at that point. As the years went on, I began to better appreciate the quality of the first two films, and unfortunately, Terminator 3 really lost it's shine. There were some good parts but they were far few in between nods to the first 2 movies and goofy humor that did not work with this film, given the circumstances taking place.
In 2004, a decade after the events of Terminator 2, Judgment Day was averted, Sarah Conner is dead, John is a ""living off the grid"" for fear that Terminators may still come after him from the future. And one does. Only this time, he's not the only target. John's future wife, Kate, is also on Skynet's hit list. And she also happens to be the daughter of the guy who oversaw the creation of Skynet. And Judgment Day is also taking place... on the same day.
The problems with this movie is that it had a lot of potential to be great, maybe not greater than Cameron's duology, but close enough to them. But the people behind this film didn't seem to care that much about it. The start of the film is a big hint. They screwed up John's age. In the narration, John says the machines tried to kill him when he was 13. He was 10 in Terminator 2. Judgment is inevitable but there is barely a discussion about it. The whole climax of T2 was based on preventing Judgment Day and the characters just shrug it off. No explanation of how Skynet still came into being, how any of Miles Dyson's research survive when they blew up Cyberdyne, nothing. Judgment Day is happening within hours and the characters don't find out until halfway through the movie. I guess that wasn't important enough to bring up until after the ""talk to the hand"" gag and all the other pointless humor. And that's another thing, the humor was so out of place for this film, especially considering that 3 billion lives are at risk of being wiped out. And this is just to tip of the ice berg.
Now, these could be seen as nitpicks but during the commentary for the film, the director (not Cameron) states that he doesn't know why Terminators arrive from the future naked. This was explained in the interrogation scene in the first Terminator film. The way how the director ignored basic lore established in the previous films makes me furious. How did we end up with people who cared so little about this universe? It's something to this day that still has me shake my head in disappointment. And it's another reason why Salvation has garnered more appreciation (the people working on that movie actually cared about the universe Cameron created).
The character of John Connor was okay, I can find it understandable why they made him the way he was. Kate Brewster was tolerable, I mean was Claire Daines the best actress they could find for the role? And of course, it was great seeing Arnold back as the Terminator even though at this point, his age was very apparent here. Kristina did a decent job as the Terminatrix, though the TX was not as menacing as the T-1000. I was disappointed Linda Hamilton didn't come back as Sarah Conner but when I found out why she refused to be in this movie, I totally understood her decision. She was barely going to be ion it and was going to die and the characters were not going to mourn her. Is it really too harsh to say the people behind this movie didn't care about it, when they were going to write the character who was the heart of the franchise in such an insulting manner.
There were some good parts such as some of the action scenes. But a lot of those were underscored by the badly placed humor. And the movie did not have the gravity of the previous films, even though there was much more at stake in this film. Even though it came out over a decade after T2, T3 has aged worse. It feels like a made for TV movie than a feature film. The ending was the best part. It was a good shock and great setup for a sequel. If only 90% of the movie was just like it.
What should have been a great addition ended up being a forgotten, lackluster entry in a dying franchise.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

Surprisingly, that is the best part of T3.  They did it right.  Don't think so?  You try to come up with a better bad guy.  It ain't easy. The action was pretty solid and the movie doesn't waste time getting uncorked.  There are very few slow points to the movie. The plot has holes in it.  So what?  It's good enough to support the action and it's pretty hard to come up with a time travel plot that doesn't have holes in it.  Only Bill and Ted could manage most excellent time travel. Bottom line:   Action was solid, direction was pretty good, the acting wasn't as good as T2 and the music didn't have the drive of either of the first two.

717,BenWydeven,*SPOILERS* No James Cameron? Don't let it discourage you. **,6,2 July 2003,"I went to Terminator 3 with skepticism, having enjoyed watching T2 over and over as a kid (I'm 22). The thing that really bugged me initially about Terminator 3 before I entered the theater, was that there was no Linda Hamilton and no Edward Furlong.No James Cameron too direct!?How good can it be??Having just seen Terminator 3 a little over an hour ago, I can't remember the last time I was blown away by a movie. Arnold is still as cool as ever, reprising his breakthrough role with more stunts that you can expect a 54 year old body builder to take on. The Terminatrix is great and Kristanna Loken takes the role with artificial intelligence written all over her. Nick Stahl has the John Connor role down to a T. The Kate Brewster character had to sink in for a while, but the chemistry between her and Connor is comparable to that of Kyle and Sarah.However, if you know and love the first two films like I do, you can only get so much out of the third act. It has all the action and explosions that you can expect from a summer action thriller. But there lacks the storytelling that James Cameron was known to carefully mesh into breathtaking action and effects. Without the powerful story telling of James Cameron, this movie is really just about getting away from the bad guy and stopping the inevitable nuclear war. I loved seeing prototypes of the Skynet computers come to life, reconizing them from the first two movies. I was even taken by Kate Brewster's connection to John Connor and events preceding Terminator 2 and the way they hate each other upon knowing they will one day be married. But despite the cleverness, familiarity and even the disturbing nuclear fear that John Mostow brings to the series I struggle to come to the conclusion that Terminator 3: The Rise of the Machines is just a way to bring back a loved character.

718,Animsteve,A big let down for true fans,4,7 July 2003,"Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines did not do justice to the series at all. There were more plot holes and mistakes within this movie then I've ever seen in a movie with a budget of 170 million dollars. The problems are consistent throughout. First of all, and the biggest shortcoming, is the fact that James Cameron did not direct this film. This new director who calls himself a true ""fan"" of the series knows nothing about it and nothing about a good movie. The terminator is seen as a running gag, something to laugh at and not something to fear or respect. As far as the TX, she was not acceptable as a killing machine. She inspires no fear and creates no suspense as she chases the main characters. Although she is referred to as the ultimate killing machine, she is inferior to the less advanced T-1000. Nick Stahl, the actor who played John Connor, is not fit to be the future leader in the fight against the machines. He is scared and pretty much just a figure head within the film offering no real development in his role. In fact, no character is developed well in this film and the terminators are much too humanlike. My advice for the true fans of the series is to not bother going to see it. In fact, I am going to pretend this movie never happened. It is not a part of the series to me. After watching the film one thought went through my head, ""What was the point of that movie?""

They made two good movies that told a good story and had a near-perfect ending and they should have left it alone. But, Hollywood is all about making money, and for a few million dollars they were willing to undo that ending and create a new one that was rather unsatisfying and makes you look back with skepticism on the efforts of the futuristic characters of the first two movies.

One man, his robot (a fat Arnold) and ""the girl"" (Danes) tries to save the day. However another robot, much more advanced (and definitely more sexy) than the old, first-generation-demo-robot, are sent to kill the heroes.I liked T1 and T2. T3 is another story. The plot is absolutely ridiculous. The acting is a joke. I can't even decide if Claire Danes or supermodel Kristina Loken is the worst actor in the movie. Arnold is just a tired cliche. If you like action, go and see Matrix reloaded instead. T3 is a commercial ripoff. Of course there will be yet another sequel. Beware. 2/10",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

The thing you got to understand is this is like jurassic park three it is a none stop action packed romp no most people were expecting a film like the previous two where we new little about terminators or what they could do. in this movie it's more about survial and coming to girps with reallity.
All the preformances where supurb and arnold was amazing for being 50 he still wowed me at every turn
I recomend it for anyone like for action packed movie. 9/10",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
725,hales_r_us,well...it's certainly funny,6,11 July 2003,"This movie was definately missing something without James Cameron and Linda Hamilton.  The special effects were fantastic, and everything else was lukewarm. There was the fair share of humor in this movie that wasn't in the earlier ones...our society has made such a joke out of Arnold's mannerisms and accent in this movie that they movie itself makes fun of it.  For example, when Nick Stahl is asking the Terminator if he remembers John from before, and he's like ""Do the words 'Asta la Vista, baby' mean anything to you?"" and so forth. This movie also takes advantage of the fact that the T-X is a really hot blonde 5'11 woman.  Very corny parts with her include when she gets pulled over and, spotting the Victoria's Secret ""What is Sexy"" billboard, makes her breasts grow about 5 inches...and then when the cop comes she says in her seductive voice, ""I like your GUN."" In terms of acting, it's what you'd expect from a Terminator movie...Arnold IS the Terminator, so no complaints there, and Nick Stahl fills in nicely as John Connor, though I think I speak for a lot of people when I say it would have been nice to see Eddie Furlong again.  Claire Danes was a little more sketchy.  A lot of her movies have been either flops (Polish Wedding, the Mod Squad) or just plain bad (Brokedown Palace), but she has made enough of a career out of pretty good movies (the Hours, Romeo and Juliet, Igby Goes Down) that I don't think the hard core action is her thing.  She's like a little girl in the movie and just looks uncomfortable blowing things up with machine guns...although the script has given her some scenes that were so lame that it would be hard for anyone to act them well ( ie telling the T-X to ""Just die you bitch!""). Overall, this movie was alright...the humor and action make it enjoyable, and any hardcore Terminator fan will enjoy.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
726,brodieman1982,wonderful,8,2 July 2003,"I've seen Matrix, X-men, the Hulk, and even Finding Nemo.  I loved all these movies, but I think that T3 is the best movie of the summer.  It had a better story than the Hulk, more action packed than X2 and more consistent(computer graphic wise) than Matrix.It was exciting from the very begin.  The first car chase seen was jaw dropping.  I swear my mouth was opened the whole time from amazement. I was at the edge of my seat the whole time. Most of the computer graphics actually looked real.  There are very few movies that have looked as good.There are problems though. It is not as good as the first two.  Allow there are better action scenes, the character development is lacking. In T2, you can sense a closeness between Arnold and John, but it just wasn't there in T3.  Also there was little chemistry with John and lover interest Claire Danes.  Danes is also suppose a close relationship with her father in the movie, but they don't develop it enough for you to care.Despite that it is a well made movie.  My advice, if you want a story as good as the first two, don't go.  This movie is not going to win any oscars.

731,red_core,"compact, exciting, perfectly executed",8,1 July 2004,"Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is a rare occurrence. It's a third entry to a universally revered and critically acclaimed blockbuster action film series. And yet, it's far more taut and far less ambitious than its prequels. Too many big-budget sequels try to outdo the masterpiece(s) that preceded them by being bigger, badder, longer. In the end, such sequels often underwhelm or fail. Star Wars, the Matrix, the list continues (Lord of the Rings is an exception; ALL THREE films comprising the series are huge and ambitious).Terminator 2: Judgment Day was a huge, ambitious, ground-breaking sequel to a small, well done, highly-successful production. But in its ambition and scale it succeeded brilliantly, making probably the greatest action film of all time.T3 doesn't try to be another T2. Its running time is about 90 minutes (compare that with 2.5 hours for the previous entry). Much of the cast is gone, and James Cameron is replaced by some outside screenwriters and Jonathan Mostow directing. Thoughtful ruminations on the nature of man are cut down to some intense, less sweeping in scope, much more personal conversations. The action is almost non-stop, and the sense of urgency is there in every single frame. The result is quite a sight to behold, for any action fan. It's as if the makers of T3 decided to take what made T2 so unusual and throw it away, somehow making this fact a strength. T2 was a great film, but it could be slow in parts (especially the director's cut) and was tough to digest. T3 isn't a great film, but it is excellent, nonetheless, and the pacing is its greatest strength.T3 is set ""today."" John Connor (now played by Nick Stahl) is in his early 20s, and the date that was to be Judgment Day (nuclear World War III) has passed. His mother is now dead from natural causes, but to her dying day she knew that the machines must not get to her son. The usual time-travel paradox rears its ugly head here, but we'll ignore that. John, who never wanted to be savior of mankind, nevertheless ""lives off the grid"" so that there is no computerized way to get to him.Ostensibly, there is no Judgment Day, there is no SkyNet, and there should be no machine menace. And yet, a female-looking terminator (the T-X) is sent through time. She starts methodically clipping teenagers (for what reason, we don't know).The trusty T800 (Arnold, again) also reappears. Clearly he's there to protect John, but his other motives aren't quite known. In any case, soon John Connor, T800, and a seemingly random female veterinarian (Claire Danes) are on the run from from T-X, the law, and who knows what else.I don't want to give away any more of the strong plot, which is revealed primarily through terse conversations with the good terminator. I'll just say that the plot is well done -- especially considering the hole the T2 ending put the writers into -- and the ending is outstanding.The plot's fine, but it's the pacing and action that are the true strength of the film. You see (this isn't much of a spoiler, since it was all over the trailers), Judgment Day is *today*. That means our friends have 2-3 hours to do something about it, or else.... The action starts immediately and doesn't really stop. (Case in point: Watch for the VERY FIRST TIME T800 and T-X meet in a scene. The directness of the T800's approach is quite amusing.) There are multiple car chases and many fights. In particular, one of each stands out. First, there's a scene where a mobile crane, with T800 on top, is driven THROUGH several city blocks. It's really something to behold. That is, it's impressive until the finishing stunt, which is simply staggering (even if it could, in principle, be CGI). The other standout action sequence is the T800-T-X hand-to-hand combat scene. You'll see T-X (an attractive, slender female) throw T800 (a hulking body-builder) through several walls in ONE throw. Then you'll see said bodybuilder break a urinal on said model's head. Of course, it wouldn't be a Terminator movie without a SWAT team trying to stop Arnold with bullets, which is always fun due to its futility.The actionless moments, while few, carry plenty of dramatic weight. John is a reluctant hero, played to perfection by Stahl. Danes is amusing as an action heroine, but her good moments are while she's still just a vet. Arnold is perfect as the Terminator -- in fact, better than ever (and, while he's got a few lines on his face, he's perfectly buff, just like in 1992). He delivers his lines, whether serious or humorous (and there is lot of, perhaps too much, humor) in a perfect dead-pan style. The script, thankfully, doesn't give him anything sentimental (human) to say (correcting one of T2's greatest weaknesses), so he doesn't struggle at any point. The emotional connection between John (or whoever) and T800 is never really explored in depth, avoiding that aspect of the previous film (again, a good move).The rating I give to this film is 8/10. Anything under 7 would be ridiculous, as anyone claiming this isn't at least a GOOD action film (it is sure as hell better than all the comic movies that get high scores) needs their head examined. I give it another point because what it does attempt to do it accomplishes so easily and perfectly. (For reference, I gave T2 a ten.) Any true weakness it has is simply that it's just an action movie, and that's it. It's hard to say anything bad (other than nitpicks) about the film itself.P.S. Some of the later comments on this movie really leave me speechless. You'll get no argument from me: T3 is certainly not T2. But it's not trying to be T2. I know, you don't care what it's trying to be, you just want to be entertained. Well, that's what the film delivers. Any serious comparison (where one wishes T3 was more like T2) to the 2nd Cameron opus is misguided, and only serves to confuse oneself. I wish I could recommend you not to watch T2 before watching this film, to give you a clean slate. But I cannot, since T3 clearly assumes knowledge of both of its two prequels, at least plotwise.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

I will first say that I enjoyed the first two films and the second one was one of my favorite movies. But then James Cameron left the franchise to let the very skilled Jonathan Mostow take over.You can tell Cameron has left the franchise in the first few minutes of the movie because Cameron would never have a female terminator in his movie. Plus the fact that they went all out sexy on this villain is way too distracting to the male viewer to think of her as a villain. Also, this movie lacked the character development, plot, script, heart, talent, and effort of the first two films. They mostly look like they are trying to do a Michael Bay explosion/no plot kind of film, but hey, at least Michael Bay can entertain! Unlike the first two films, I did not care about the characters, heck one character was so annoying that I didn't care if she died, and could really care less about the whole plot in general.

I am however a hardcore fan but I don't consider this movie as an insult. For me the problem was that this film basically ignores the first two films. It's like the The Exorcist: The Heretic, it completely ignores the main events of the first part. If you are going to make a sequel, make sure that you include the events in the first part. Aliens did but again it was an action movie, not a Sci-Fi horror film like the first part was. Plus I think it was a good idea to have a female antagonist but it doesn't mean anything if she does the same thing over & over again. T-1000 from Judgement Day didn't do the same thing like T-800 did in the first Terminator film.

734,FilmCritic1,How did this happen?,1,7 December 2006,"Spoiler alert! Please be advised.Terminator 3 was one of the most elaborate trailers (for Terminator 4) that I've ever seen! They should have cut this film down to twenty minutes, and added the content that they will be using in T4, but then, that would only give them one box office cash-in to look forward to, wouldn't it? (Ignore the fact that there wasn't enough content in T3 to compose a mentally gripping feature).I can get over the fact that the story had no real point. Do any of the Terminator films really have any mentally or spiritually beneficial message? No. It's not expected from a film about machines that kill people. But it is a frustrating experience to sit through two hours of fluff and exploding cars only to discover that you'll have to wait for T4 in order to get to the action that the T3 trailers promised you.If you're a die-hard Schwarzenegger fan, and a sucker for the Terminator franchise, and you have a thing for Kristanna Loken, well...you'll probably still be disappointed, but like the droves that delivered a $150 million box office for the film, you'll probably still put yourself through the painful experience, so when it's over, just remember: you were warned.

Arnold is plastic this time around and not very machine-like at all. The female terminator is a nice change of pace, but she is just that: a woman instead of a man to kill John Conner. Only Nick Stahl was any good in this movie. And he tries to create that same sense of fear and danger that was apparent in the first two terminator movies, but for all his effort it isn't there.
If you are looking to watch something close to a James Cameron movie you may be very disappointed. But if you are looking for computer generated effects, not as much action as the previous two movies, and not have anything really answered from the second movie, then this may not be worth watching. Here's hoping T4 will be more coherent and have more action. ** 1/2 out of *****",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

The Authors show no clue if they know what large Infrastructure and Economy is modern day Technology based upon.Where are the Power Supplies, Factories, Mines, where is the transportation System and the Research Facilities to give any power at all to the Skynet System? It would have nuked out its own Requirements to exist by destroying mankind with nuclear weapons. So ""The rise of the machines"" would have been the end of any advanced machine and technological progress on earth.Instead, in Reality, the growing Power of Machines over Mankind is exercised through shaping Society according to the needs of Machines and Technology, not by simply destroying human Lives. I would have liked to see that Twist going somewhere into the series Finale (so eg. by preventing the nuclear War, Connor actually helps the Machines to seize Control) - well it did not and the Script stayed true to the Vision of the first and second Terminator Movie.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

A lack of suspense.The dialogues are not written with passion. A lack of feeling.John Connor has been made a wuss and is miscast even then.The T800 is not really protecting John nor Kathleen in this one. The bullets are flying left and right while he just drives the van. They're just driving into freaking Mexico. They have no plan.The TX - the new Terminator villain is not explained at all. What is she? What are her special powers? How exactly is she more advanced than T1000? She jumpstarts a car with her fingernail - what is that? She can produce any weapon but how? This whole concept is really lacking imagination. The TX visual display screen is really lacking imagination. Kristina Loken is quite attractive but she is not scary in any way.Claire Danes is the best part of this movie. Her character makes ridiculous choices but thats because of the bad screenplay. She plays good.Kathleen Brewster's father is really miscast.Some of the action scenes were quite enjoyable. The jokes are cheap and recycled from previous Terminator movies.The camera angles are wrong, T800 is not shown strong. Editing is wrong. (A lot of boring dialogue could have been left out.) The scenes are too clean. (Where is all that dark and gritty future?) The car chase was pretty cool. The CGI snake is fake. The music has no bass and low frequencies. The movie feels dated already.

It was not a taught B-movie thriller like T1, or a faultless big budget sci-fi classic like T2, but it certainly entertained for 2 hours without getting boring.  (I couldn't say the same of the other summer blockbuster I saw recently, ""Hulk"".  I had to see that twice to check I wasn't imagining how BAD it was the first time.)***** contains mild SPOILERS ******T3 doesn't really bother trying to explain why Terminators even continue to exist post the seemingly ""final"" events of T2, instead it attempts to capture the audience's attention, with the promise of some impressive stunts, action sequences and effects (right from the opening shot of a nuclear detonation), and a large helping of ""more of the same"".It certainly delivers on more of the same, with some great action sequences (T-X driving the crane was particularly good), nice effects, and constant pursuit of John Connor by a particularly mean, seeming unstoppable (and this time not unattractive) machine (apologies to Robert Patrick!), which again is defeated in an ingenious manner.Where it fell down for me was:1)  it lacked the originality of either of it's predecessors, both in terms of plot, and in terms of set pieces (I guess there are only so many ways a machine can bash another machine into a wall repeatedly, but Arnie shooting up loads of cops then do a ""000"" count of human victims?  Surely we've seen that before!) 2)  it had a few too many attempts at humour (that is how we spell ""humor"" it in England BTW), which I think robbed it of the tension of the earlier movies.  For ever slice of ""talk to the hand"" genius, there was a dog line (""I'm back!"" was easily the worst).But overall, it was more fun to watch than a lot of blockbusters I've seen recently.

Personally I really liked the movie, action and all of that but I gotta admit some stuff was lacking like I missed the relationship building between the characters like Arnie and John Connor how they were 'friends' in the 2nd movie. In this movie Arnie seemed alot less friendly and I didn't really like that.

Ah-nold is geat once again as the T-101. Stahl does aight, Danes is ok, and the Terminatrx is rightfully creepy, and its about time we saw some female booty in these films. The start with Stahl narrating is unnecessary and too long. There mustve been better ways to explain the set up. The action scenes are fanatic, not qite as coherent as Cameron's but they are on a much bigger scale. T2 had a semi versus a motor bike, T3 has a big crane truck and a bunch of police cars versus a pickup. The terminator vs. terminator fights are terrific as well. The ending to this movie is absolutely brilliant. a lot of people are going to complain, but they are dumb. The end of this film finally clears up the paradoxes of time travel in the first two. In T2, when they destroyed the pieces of the previous T-101, that T-101 should've ceased to exist, sorta like Mike J. Fox n Back to the Future, but this problem is solved ingeniously. All in all, first is the worst, second is the best, and the third is in-between as far as this trilogy goes. Dont get me wrong, the original is great, it just hasnt aged well. It seems a lot of people have it out for Ah-nold, I really don't understand why, Arnold has more charisma ad star power in one  arm than the Rock or Vin Diesel have in their entire bodies.

745,mnemosyne23,Awe. SOME. This is a MUST SEE MOVIE,10,2 July 2003,"Yesterday, my friend and I were discussing how bad ""T3"" was going to be. ""Just a shameless chance to make money off a dead franchise,"" we said. ""One more cog in Hollywood's sucky-sequel routine.""  Of course, being ""Terminator"" fans, we knew we were going to go see it anyway, good or bad. So tonight, I sat down, leaned back, and waited to be bored.Instead, I was totally blown away.""T3: Rise of the Machines"" picks up the story of John Connor (Nick Stahl), the protagonist of ""T2"" and the future savior of mankind.  Immediately, from the first words of the film, I knew I was in for something more than just another action movie; another ""shameless"" plug for a ""dead franchise."" Rather than taking the usual Hollywood route and placing John in a high profile career - lawyer, doctor, car salesman - ""T3"" reveals that John is a drifter, aware of his destiny and unconvinced that he is really as safe as we were all led to believe at the end of ""T2.""  Naturally, since this is the third movie and we're only two minutes into the film, we know that he's correct - he isn't safe.  Something is going to happen to make John Connor realize his destiny, or else put it to rest entirely.
That something is the T-X (Kristanna Loken)- aka the Terminatrix - a state-of-the-art Terminator sent from the future (once again) to destroy John Connor, but with an added twist: she's there to kill his lieutenants as well.  All and any who are an aid to John in his future battle against the machines have become targets, including Kate Brewster (Claire Danes), a girl John knew as a child.  Helping to protect John and Kate from the T-X is the inimitable T-800 (Arnold Schwarzenegger), a carbon copy of the Terminators that tried to murder Sarah Connor in the original film, and then went on to save her and John in ""T2.""Nick Stahl turns in a touching and nuanced performance as John Connor.  He doesn't want to accept his destiny, but when it rears its ugly head, he falls into the role of hero with ease and aplomb - you can see the emerging leader he will become.  Claire Danes, as always, is believable as the spunky but flustered Kate, who spends half the movie believing she's been kidnapped.  Arnold Schwarzenegger brings the T-800 to life with the same complexity as in ""T2,"" giving touches of humor throughout the film that sound perfectly natural coming from the unemotional machine.  Kristanna Loken is the only weak part of the film - she tries too hard to be a carbon copy of Robert Patrick's menacing T1000 from ""T2,"" and ends up looking like a bad Lara Croft impersonator, scowling under her eyebrows throughout most of her scenes.  Whereas Patrick was gifted with a lean body, chiseled features, and bone-chilling, serial killer eyes that made you BELIEVE he could kick Arnold around like a rag doll, it's difficult to imagine this slip of a girl even being able to give him a papercut.Luckily for us, the T-X seems almost an afterthought throughout the film. Most of the storyline is focused around the trio of Stahl, Danes and Schwarzenegger, as they struggle to stop Skynet from becoming self-aware and destroying the planet.  But before you start thinking this movie is too cerebral, rest assured, the pacing is fast and furious, full of enough gunfire, explosions and insane car chases to make your eyes boggle.  One particular chase scene close to the beginning of the movie - which appears to leave half of Los Angeles in a pile of rubble - is breathtaking in its intensity.  It's like the world's worst early morning rush hour traffic, where every other car on the road is LITERALLY out to get you.This movie is rated R for a reason, and that reason is BLOOD.  But the violence is given a Hitchcockian twist - a spatter of blood across a picture frame while the sound of a dentist's drill whirs in the background.  Your imagination is enough to make you shudder or jump in your seat - director Jonathan Mostow doesn't feel the need to swamp the screen with wanton violence.  So while the body count is on a par with the first two films, it doesn't FEEL so violent.I also appreciated the fact that they didn't feel the need to indulge in unnecessary ""cheese cake"" when the T-X first arrived on the scene.  Yes, this film has an R-rating, and yes, the primary audience is going to be young men, ages 18-34, so I was expecting full frontal nudity.  But the entrance of T-X is tastefully done, with strategically positioned shadows hiding the ""naughty bits.""  I think Arnold gets to flash more skin than Ms. Loken!Most fun of all, this movie isn't afraid to poke fun at itself and its predecessors.  There are moments throughout the film that hint back to events in the previous movies with a tongue-in-cheek playfulness, such as a recurring gag involving the T-800's sunglasses, made so famous in ""T2."" These humorous moments don't detract from the film - they add to it, by reminding the audience of just why they love the series so much.  More than once, the entire theater was laughing or clapping at what was going on onscreen, and you can't ask for better response than that at a movie like this.""T3"" is just... phenomenal.  It's hard to put into words just what is so GOOD about it.  All I can say is, if you'd asked me yesterday if I wanted to see a ""T4,"" I would have given you an uncategorical, ""NO!""  But today, as I sit here, if you were to ask me the exact same question, I'd stare at you and say, ""What, you mean you DON'T?""  It's THAT good, folks.  It turned this cynic into a believer, and it didn't even break a sweat.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
746,bmwxcoupe,The best yet!,8,2 July 2003,"I saw Terminator 3 July 1st at the first sneak previewing near me.  This movie has a great story line, is action packed, explains why Judgement Day still happens really well, and the chase scene itself beats the entire Matrix Reloaded!  This movie is almost nonstop action from beginning to end. This movie also explains what happened to Sarah Conner.  Don't beleive critics who say this movie ""sucks"",""has no story line"", ""Arnold Schwarzenegger won't do any more movie from how terrible this is"", etc. etc. etc.  It is nothing but lies!  The best movie I have seen in a long time. This is a must see!!",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

Many sequels, particularly in action and science fiction genres, destroy their own narrative, continuity and mythology by throwing in a retcon. This seemed to follow neatly from the first two films, explaining the revised Judgement Day without really contradicted the second film. It stuck to its formula, threw in a bunch of fan favourite phrases and images. Pretty enjoyable really.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
748,choobieflowergirl,great movie with thoughtful action,9,2 July 2003,"I loved this movie. Yes James Cameron is a much, much better director but, the script was really good. It's sad that James didn't direct it because it was worthy of his attention. This movie has action, laughs, surprise twists and great acting! Arnold has gone the extra yard for a touchdown. Christana Loken was fantastic and a much better terminator than the villain-terminator in T2. Claire Danes gave a wonderful performance and the guy who played the John Conner character left us feeling just the way we should about John Conner. The F/X were really good and there were creative twists. But forget the 'splosions and think about what's being said. These movies are warning about technology out of control. Surprise ending was really good. Over-all: very high quality science fiction that can be appreciated on many levels.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
749,HHoffman-2,"A good, but flawed, attempt at continuing James Cameron's legacy.",7,19 August 2006,"Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is often criticized by fans as being not in the same tone as its predecessors. While I agree with that statement in many ways, I think Jonathan Mostow made an honest effort to bookend the series.Storyline: The story is probably one of the things I take issue with most. It brings up new questions on the nature of time travel within the Terminator universe, as well as bringing new plot holes (something the previous films also had). Some of these flubs could've been corrected with a little research, but I digress.The story tends to be a retread of Terminator 2, which hurts it a lot. But Mostow tries to draw attention away from this with some awesome action sequences. The storyline, in this respect, takes it up a notch with scenes such as the restroom fight and crane scene.Acting: I think the acting is one of the best things in this film. Mostow did an excellent job in casting. Rather than going for actors known for their work in action films, the director instead used performers known for their talent in dramatic roles. Nick Stahl and Claire Danes both portray their characters with depth and humanity. Stahl does an especially good role in showing the paranoia and uncertainty of the future.And, as always, Arnold Schwarzenegger does a great job as the Terminator. His lack of social interaction provides many humorous moments throughout the film, while also giving him a drill instructor approach when dealing with the John Connor character.Lastly, there is Kristanna Loken as the T-X. While not as intimidating as the T-1000, I didn't expect this to be the case. Robert Patrick played a character with no face and every face, which can only work once if at all. That being said, Loken does a decent job in the role, providing a very cold performance for an equally cold character.Visual/Special Effects: The visuals of Terminator 3 are pretty good. The liquid metal effects are still as great as they were in 1991 along with some of the CG animated endoskeletons in the Future War sequence.My only qualms with the visuals is that there is a lack of blue tint that was prevalent in James Cameron's previous films, but this is more a matter of taste than anything.Musical Score: Brad Fiedel's dark and mechanical theme is absent from the film until the credits arrive, which is something that bothered me. Not only that, but T3's rendition of the theme isn't as powerful as it is in its predecessors. However, Marco Beltrami does manage to increase the tension of scenes with his score, though little else. This aspect, like the storyline, could of been improved.Conclusion: Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines wasn't a necessary sequel, but a decent one. I don't believe this installment ruined the series as much as, say, Alien^3. This film will no doubt continue to be one that either fans love or hate.I happen to love it.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
750,mike_k56,What can I say?,4,23 May 2012,"This movie was entertaining! But if you've ever seen T2 you'll notice numerous instances where the director tried to steal from Cameron and failed.The only reason Arnold agreed to semi-star in this film is because he got a gigantic paycheck. I know he is a billionaire, but he still likes to make money. If he had any integrity as a 'real' actor he would have turned this role down. But we all know he's not a 'real' actor.The girl terminator they sent back in time could have been better cast by most people on the street, as her only real dramatic skills involve tilting her head in every other scene.Good movie if you aren't looking for a good movie.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
751,shez-dogg,Not Very Good,5,23 July 2011,"I know I'm not the first to do this, but i feel it's necessary to mention T2. I recently watched it, and I can tell you now that this movie is unwanted. The ending to T2 (I won't tell you what it is) is one of the most satisfying movie endings I have ever seen, and is up there with films like Saving Private Ryan and the Star Wars saga. This film takes the main idea from the first two (the 'changing the future' theme) and simply throws it out of the window. When this came out we were like: ""Hang on? Rise of the machines? But it ended in the last one!"" And so begins one of the many problems with this movie.1) James Cameron. I see why he avoided this; they basically got his work and flushed it down the loo; claiming their's was better.2) Arnie. He was brilliant in T1, perfect in T2 (his smile at the minigun still goes down as pure genius in my eyes) but he has simply run out of steam. He was old, human and dull in T3.3) It wasn't a Terminator movie. Sure, it has Terminator in the title, but so does Terminator Salvation, and that's about as far from a Terminator film as you can get (while still using the same setting). I actually didn't mind TS, because it didn't pretend to be a Terminator film. This, however, did, and failed. I mean, it's a 12! 4) The characters. I didn't feel connected with any of them. Sorry to bring it up again, but in T2 Sarah and John Connor were brilliant, with Sarah's slow realisation about the machines and her transformation into someone less crazy and John's childishness showing through his hard outer shell were brilliantly portrayed, both with acting and writing. In this though, both were lacking in style and substance, and I found myself actually getting annoyed with John.5) A female Terminator. Don't mean to be sexist, but come on! Watching this movie left me with a bad taste in my mouth. I am disappointed with the people behind this film for messing with such cinematic brilliance created by the first two. However, some action scenes pretty well directed, and the humour was quite funny in some places, but not T2 funny, like ""He'll live"". It was an uncool funny. for those reasons, it just wasn't very good.5/10",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
752,Andyboy_17,"It has the Action and entertainment, but lacks the originality and intelligence",7,12 May 2004,"To follow up a great film like ""Terminator 2 - Judgment Day"" (1991), which is probably the best Action-film I've ever seen, is not easy.  To be honest...it's nearly impossible. Especially if your name is Jonathan Mostow and not James Cameron.  Cameron is one of the best Action-directors ever, with high quality, brilliant and intelligent Action/Science Fiction-films like ""The Abyss"" (1989), ""Aliens"" (1986), ""The Terminator"" (1984) and the mentioned ""Terminator 2"" under his belt.  When I first heard that James Cameron was not going to be involved in ""Terminator 3 - The Rise Of The Machines"", I knew that it wasn't going to be a film at the level of it's prequels.  And after I saw the first trailers, I prepared myself for an almost mindless Action-film, yet an entertaining one (I'm a huge fan of the whole Terminator concept, so that's enough to satisfy me) that was going to do it's best to overwhelm the fantastic Action-sequences of the two other films. Last summer, when I went to the cinema and watched it for the first time, that's almost what i got....John Connor has erased his identity and tries to hide his existence, in fear of being find by another terminator, after the death of his mother Sarah Connor.  One day he runs into Kate Brewster who is also going to play an important role in the future of the human beings.  After a little while, they're being chased by two terminators.  A T-X (played by Kristanna Loken) and a T-800 (the Terminator himself, Arnold Schwarzenegger).  The T-X is sent to kill a number of people, including Connor and Brewster, and the T-800 is sent to protect the two of them. Suddenly they find themselves fighting against time, to save the humanity from a nuclear war.That's the story of the film...simple as that.  But this story definitely provides almost two hours of good entertainment and ""non-stop"" Action. Because this is the kind of film you can really describe with the mark Non-Stop Action.  I've heard that this movie is the most expensive ever made.  And after watching the breathtaking Action and Special Effects of this film, I won't doubt that.  The ones who loved the first Terminator-films only for the Action-scenes, shouldn't be disappointed. But the ones who also loved the fascinating and originality of the characters and the whole story and concept, is surely to be (at least) a bit disappointed.This is a much more simple movie, compared to it's prequels, and the Action and the Special Effects has to carry the film on it's own.  The prequels had some good character-development and good dialogs to put us deep into the brilliance of the story.  This film lacks both.  Character-development is almost completely absent.  And poor performances by Clair Danes and Nick Stahl doesn't make it any better.  They should have gotten Edward Furlong to play John Connor, just like he did in the last film.  And the dialogs are minimal too.  Much of the dialogs are just silly and doesn't grab me the same way as they did especially in ""Terminator 2"".  Even though it has the most simple story of the three films, there's no doubt that this film could have been as good as the two others, only if they would have done it in a better way.  I can see the potential just from watching the beginning and the end of the film.But the film is definitely not going downhill all the way.  Kristanna Loken is not only a EXTREEEMLY beautiful and sexy woman, but she sure is doing a good job playing the T-X.  She really have that robot-look all over her face and body when she moves and talks, and she's almost as frightening as Robert Patrick's T-1000 in ""Terminator 2"".  And Mr. Schwarzenegger...what can I say? He IS the Terminator.  He was born to play a machine from the future, and he is just as good as he was in the other films.  As mentioned before, this film has the impressive Action from it's prequels, so it's really giving me the right Terminator-feeling.  It also has the humor we saw in ""Terminator 2"", and this time it's even more of it.  So people are guaranteed to be entertained.Over all....I pretty much got what I expected from this film. ""Terminator 3 - The Rise Of The Machines"" has the trademark Terminator-Action and entertainment, but it lacks the originality and the fascinating intelligence of the other Terminator-films.  I know there's a ""Terminator 4"" on the way, which I doubt would be any better than this one.  But one can always keep a little hope that the film will be a worthy conclusion to(in my opinion) the best series of Action-movies in film-history.  Until then...just grab a bucket of popcorn and enjoy these two hours of wild, high tech Robot-Action.
7.5 out of 10",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
753,jrhgriffiths,Symphony of Steel,8,30 April 2014,"Terminator 3 is a movie that revels in the sheer power of steel, metal, and iron. The action scenes (and the movie is almost one continuous action scene) are like a symphony of metal pounding on metal. The two combatants are advanced killing machines from the future. The T-X's mission is to kill John Connor; the Terminator's to protect him. In carrying out these missions, they pound one another through walls, cars, helicopters, and even toilets. The T-X pursues John Connor in a crane truck, the truck's wrecking ball smashing dozens of cars. The Terminator shoots rocket propelled grenades into the T-X, the grenades blasting her down an elevator shaft. And the sound effects amplify every explosion and clash so that you feel enmeshed in a world of steel.Perhaps all that sounds like a giddy fanboy's reaction to an action movie. And perhaps that's fair. There's much to criticize here. The human characters are unbelievable. Nicholas Stahl as John Connor doesn't seem like the inspiring hero he will become. Claire Danes as Kate Brewster comes off silly and shy when she should be tough and grimacing. Moreover, the Terminator's one-liners are, well, corny. But this movie is like a heavy metal concert; the lyrics don't really matter.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
754,imapoa,Runs the entertainment spectrum; doofy to great!,8,17 December 2004,"Hey, I really liked Terminator 3, but no historic milestones here. Kristanna Loken, now my favorite evil cyborg, is also easy on the eyes. Like Arnold, her acting leaves something to be desired but their characters are emotionless machines, after all...well almost. T-X departs from the standard set by Terminator 1 & 2 in that she IS equipped with RAGE. Previous Terminators were supposed to be unfeeling killing machines determined to carry out their directives, although Arnold's character does develop a degree of compassion starting in 2.Great special effects, gratuitous cyber-violence, and even a surprise ending combine to make this one fun to watch. The prolonged fight scene in the restroom has comedy; the T-X instantly rolling back onto the moving truck is wicked cool, and Arnold hanging from the crane is both!",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

The original Cameron Terminator changed Cinema,also launching the career of action icon Arnold Schwarzenegger.The main problem is this flawed installment is it doesn't explain anything!Clearly in T2 the years of research destroyed at cyberdyne systems(the microprocessor chip,arm,hardrives of research) were dismissed.We are instead given the ridiculous reason that it was always meant to happen.mmm.How? There is a reason one of the main characters played by Linda Hamilton turned down the script.When she declined they killed her off,said she had cancer and put guns in her casket.Need I say more?Arnie tells more jokes rather than acting like a machine.The villain or Terminatrix is a mute model that offers nothing.This film marks the start of the reboot,remake and rehash of classic movies.The sad thing is Cameron wanted to do it but wanted more time.His disappointment reflects the majority of fans including me.Anyone who liked it all I can say is I hope you enjoy transformers 4;)",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
756,blackwolf33914,What Happened to John?,6,20 February 2014,"I just have one really important question for the filmmakers, what happened to John Connor?? In the second film he was only ten but was a really tough smart mouthed one, the fourth film had an adult tough John Connor that was believable that he was the same boy from T2. The third film however, for some strange reason, casted young adult Connor as a whim. Not only did he look nothing like a strong soldier but he also was mentally destroyed, seriously doubt anyone raised like he was raised would be complaining about be worth nothing or giving up on life. Luckily the fourth movie casted Christian Bale and gave Connor his balls back. That was my main problem with T3, besides how they made it the exact same way as the second one. Fell into the typical thought that if a movie was popular a sequel that's exactly the same plot will be an equal hit; most fans of a film series grows tired if they're all the same in thought. Schwarzenegger is once again great at playing everyone's favorite robot, he's the best part of this movie.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

758,david77,film sinks under its own weight,4,4 July 2003,"Having seen all three of the Terminator films as an adult, I've been progressively disappointed as the movies have come along. The first was by far the best, with real characters, a great story idea, and a solid script. The second, Judgment Day, presented a great chase sequence, but progressed poorly thereafter with weak acting and a script that steadily worsened. While the special effects were amazing at the time, the film failed where it counts most: the appearance of sympathetic characters. This last installment, which hopefully will indeed be the last, is easily the weakest in the series with very poor acting, and a script that relies mostly on special effects and chase scenes. The attempts at humor are badly needed in this movie, which was borderline boring. Even Arnold, sorry to say, seems tired of his character. With all its heavy machinery, the film sinks under its own weight.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
759,CSe7en,Rise of the Mostow/ Extremely brave piece of storytelling. (Spoilers),10,3 August 2003,"I don't know what I was expecting with this installment of the popular Terminator franchise. I really enjoyed Mostow's previous films 'Breakdown' and 'U-571'. But it was not the look or the direction of the film that worried me but the story. The early premise of the film seemed to be an exact replica of T-2 but less Linda Hamilton an older John Connor with love interest and a sexy, beautiful and more effective killing machine T-X. I imagined that once again Judgement Day was going to happen and once again Connor with protecting Terminator would save the day.But the script with a wicked sense of humour was brave and original, well mostly. I loved the ending and I wasn't expecting it, I thought we were going to get a soapy ending. I was fascinated by the destiny of man and whether they can do anything to stop it even when the characters are clearly told it. It was also leaner, I thought that Cameron in the writing process may have spread out the idea of the Terminator having a split personality over his operating functions.By the way Arnie looked the best he ever has in his leather threads. Claire Danes and Kristanna Loken are extremely sexy in differing ways and I felt Nick Stahl played John Connor very well as a neurotic young man with the burden of the fate of humanity on his shoulders.There was maybe one major goof the two scribes made though, and I don't know if they were just treating the audience as idiots. But in the camper on the way to Robert Brewster the issue comes up that the Termiantor has been sent back not by Connor but by Brewster a future leading General in the Resistance. Why Brewster and not Connor because in 2032 Connor gives the order for the Terminator of Arnie's type to terminate him. Connor says something on the lines of 'who killed me' and the Terminator says 'I did'. Well so far during the film the Terminator has expressed on a number occasions how he has come of an assembly line and has nothing to do with the 'Uncle Bob' model sent back in 1992. The Termiantor in T-3 has no way to get back to the future and he surely knows his fate at the start of the mission and if he has nothing to with 'Uncle Bob' he will have nothing to do with the Termiantor that will do the deed. Arnie later says to Connor 'Thank you' for holding up the automative door and Arnie say 'We will meet again'. But maybe that is understandable because that Terminator though not sent back by Connor probably met him in the future.Will there be another Termiantor film, well 'there is no fate except for what we make it'. So I suppose if everybody gets to the cinema and sees this film as many times as possible the better the chance of T-4. Would I like to see another Termiantor post 'Judgement Day' you better ya. The chances it would be a major turkey increases but if they get the brilliant Mostow and the same scribes it should be alright. But first I am looking forward to the remake of 'Westworld' with the Arnie and the T-3 scribes.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
760,bryanmorand,An excellent third installment with plenty of scope for more,9,19 July 2003,"I really looked forward to the third installment in The Terminator series and I was not disappointed. This film was action all the way, with some amazing special effects that at times made The Matrix - Reloaded look pedestrian! The car chase scene with the crane truck was just mind blowing and the final bit of destruction in these scenes just eye candy for the dangerous at heart. The special effects in general were well crafted, hammering the senses all the way. Arnie was at his quipping best and looked in superb shape for his age. Nich Stahl was great as John Connor considering the legacy preceding him and one can only hope that there will be a fourth movie to cement his ownership of the character. Claire Danes was equally as good in her role, giving a good mix of vulnerability and survival desperation. Kristanna Loken as T-X gave a brilliant menacing performance - I don't think I'll look at a blonde haired, blue eyed babe in the same way ever again. I hope her character can be resurrected in a fourth film.The storyline was crisp and flowing, with only a few minor flat spots and the revelation at the very end will surprise most.

But for non-stop action that leaves you riveted to your seat, and interesting twists in the story of John Connor, I think T3 delivers the goods.  After reading so many strongly negative reviews, I went to T3 with lowered expectations, and received quite a pleasant surprise.  I think Nick Stahl did a credible job as John Connor - I found myself having no problem accepting him as the young adult incarnation of the future savior of humanity.  Arnold, although 12 years older, is still THE Terminator (although I felt a few of the gags, such as the star-framed glasses, were silly and inappropriate).  And I think Kristanna Loken was good as the T-X; attractive as she was, I think she was sufficiently terrifying.  While the movie doesn't develop the characters, it didn't prevent me from sympathizing with and rooting for the good guys.  The action scenes were excellent - the first chase sequence was one of the best I've ever seen.  And the ending came as quite a surprise.  A thoroughly enjoyable movie.  Whether this was the end of the Terminator saga, or if there's a T4, I think the movie was a worthy successor to T1 and T2, definitely worth the money, as well as the 12 year wait.  8 out of 10 stars.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

As has already been mentioned, the action and effects are heart-pounding, and the visuals are dazzling, but the movie also raised questions about predestination and explored the means by which the robots were to eventually take over the world.

Because she can hotwire a car?  And did they really kill her off the same way they killed Arnold off in the first Terminator?  You have GOT to be kidding me. The only potential saving grace is the fact that this movie is so bad, that there is a lot of unintentionally funny moments, such as the T-101's ""moral dilemma"", and a lot of the plot is comically bad.  Talk about corny.  Can Arnold even act?  I have seen a lot of his movies, and he tends to play the wooden meathead with limited vocabulary very well.  I believe we saw it in T1, T2, T3, Kindergarten Cop, Twins, Commando, and every other movie I've ever seen him in.  ""She'll be back"", ""I'm back"", ""Talk to the hand"":  If these phrases are what you want to hear over and over, then by all means, go see this terrible movie.  I believe I've heard them enough from 9 year olds imitating this movie, that I can't believe I wasted my time watching it.  At least I didn't pay for it.  I give it 2 out of 10, and that's only for the unintentionally comedic plot points.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
770,Bjelke90,How such a right movie can become so wrong,6,21 April 2009,"When I first read that Terminator 3 was being developed in mid February 2002 I jumped off my chair and cheered loudly. I remember the anticipation for the movie being huge. I was watching trailers, following updates here and on other sites on a weekly basis up until the release of the film. So I entered the cinema, only to see that someone in production didn't share my opinion on what a Terminator film is all about.A Terminator movie to me is all about the frightening, unbelievable, yet realistic story about men creating it's own doom by making smarter and smarter computers and machines. It's about the story and adventures of Sarah Connor and John Connor. It's also about having the most hardcore villains ever in firstly Arnold Schwarzenegger and secondly Robert Patrick. In the same way that Keith Richards playing guitar in the third Pirates of the Caribbean movie the casting of a Terminatrix beating up Arnold Schwarzenegger sinks a landmine into the heart of the movie. Now, Kristanna Loken is a beautiful woman, and also good at what she's doing in this film. It's only that the role she's playing doesn't work for me. I know that her role is a superior model to Arnold's and I have to think deeper than this, but there is just no way that it looks right to me when a beautiful woman kicks Arnold Schwarzeneggers but. It's a totally wrong decision in my opinion. That was the saddest part of the movie to me.And while we're at it. There's about one or two jokes in some scenes in the first two movies that never ever makes the film cross the line to being a comedic film. At parts, this movie truly is comedic and even silly. It doesn't feel like it has the right tone for a Terminator movie.The casting of Nick Stahl as John Connor isn't a perfect choice either in my opinion... He's not that good of an actor and doesn't even look like Edward Furlong a few years into the future from Terminator 2. That's why I'm so glad they cast Christian Bale as Connor for the new Terminator Salvation film since he's a much better actor and looks way more like Furlong than Stahl does.Now to the good parts of the movie. Apart from the to me obvious flaws of the movie that I presented it does have glimpses of classic Terminator quality. The core story, Terminatrix aside, is actually good. The Directing is good. Claire Danes is brilliant as well as Arnold Schwarzenegger. Kristanna Loken is good at playing a Terminatrix, it's just that her role is hopeless to succeed in my opinion. So that's a really double-edged sword. I don't think there's any woman that could have done it any better. The music arrangements are good and feel like a Terminator movie and so are some of the action scenes. I recommend this movie to those who likes to see big explosions and high speed chases, without thinking too much about what's really going on.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
771,denthegod,Awesome,10,2 July 2003,"Being an action freak I must say this movie is awesome. The action was fast paced and never dragged on for too long like Reloaded. You get the introduction of the characters in the first 10 minutes and from then on the movie kicks into high gear with gun battles and car chases with small breaks in between to develop the story. Oh, and by the way, the story was pretty good too with a little twist at the end. When I go into a movie I don't nitpick- I just want to have a good time. Only fairies nitpick.... If you want a movie that has loads of action with a decent story at the same time then this is it. Never a dull moment in the movie. This one definitely has my vote for the best action movie of the year.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
772,dkiltz,Technically well done but...,5,10 October 2004,"The film is certainly well done, technically. That is, special effects are pretty good. We got a Terminatrix this time, so some more female appeal in it. Also, the quotes are exactly where you expect them (I'm back anybody?). Still, for me that alone just doesn't make for a good movie. OK, the Skynet thingy wasn't a strong point to begin with, but what's all this pseudo-deep blah about the future and all. I mean, come on... a machine telling that 'Judgment Day' (what has this religious term to do with it all?) is 'inevitable' really pushes the envelope too much. A machine would be programmed to say what it says. It cannot 'know' what will happen, not calculate the future (chaos theory anyone ?). Far less in a situation where things depend so much on human decisions. So, what does the movie want to say ? Well, nothing. There is absolutely nothing. Watch out, machines *will* take over ? I think this movie really sends out a very bad message to kids. 'The future will be catastrophic, it can simply be computed and there's nothing we can do about it, so don't even think about trying to change stuff. Things are just gonna happen. It's well known that some of the ultra-conservative groups in the US see some sort of mass-dying as unavoidable. This kind of movies serve to condition audiences to accept this. Maybe that's the message of the film. Other than that, it's not coherent or plausible. 'Jodgment day iss inevitable'. Yes, sure, take it from Arny, it was the last 'Terminator'.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
773,skorponok,The Terminator returns to the top of the sci-fi heap.,10,2 July 2003,"My first impression of T3 was that it was going to be another retread of the same storyline established in the first two installments (evil robot sent back through time, good guy/bot is sent back to protect the target).  The original trailers for this film didn't alter that impression.  I had the feeling it was going to be lackluster.Was I ever wrong.The Story starts with ominous music by Marco Beltrami, quite a departure from the classic Terminator Score by Bad Fiedel, but it's fitting, after all this is a new story arc.  We meet up with John Connor, now in hid mid 20's and living as a transient and keeping no records of his identity (no phone, no residence, nothing) as to prevent him being tracked by any assailants from the future, should they appear.Two terminators appear from the future, one in the form of the female T-X, and one in the classic Ahnuld form.  The T-x immediately starts killing it's targets in the present, each of which will have a significance with John Connor in the future.John is hurt and breaks into a veterinary clinic to get meds to ease his pain as he mends his wounds when the T-X shows up for a target......and it's not John Connor... ...and that's all I will say...you should see this for yourself.  The second half of the movie deals with the RISE OF THE MACHINES aspect and you won't be disappointed.

There are many ""cringe moments"" but ultimately it is a lot of fun with some great action scenes.  I liked it in spite of myself. Nick Stahl as John Connor was better than Eddie Furlong, Claire Danes was believable as expected and Kristana Loken was eerie.  The worst perfomance came from Arnold-whose character was poorly and cheesily written. The ending was terrific though and redeemed the film alot.  The car chase was probably the most pointlessly obnoxious action scene ever...needless to say, I loved it.

Could be episodes of a sci-fi series.",5,25 May 2020,"Rest assured: unlike most 'reviews' on here that sum up the whole plot or movie in endless boring sentences, this will be a proper and real take on what there is to see.What stands out here is the total absence of ""wow"" and coolness.Totally different coloring/lighting, makes it look cheap. No impactful music to make some scenes at least a bit more suspenseful. Everything is just so off. You even miss set pieces that are maybe a bit iconic like the first movies.The direction/music and dare I say even the animatronics and overload of cgi are pretty ugly. You don't feel with the characters and there's a lack of imminent danger/threat. This is a movie about the end of the world here, just to remind you. Ending is then rushed, set pieces were totally forgettable except for the very last scenes maybe.. Almost zero chemistry between actors. Claire Daines and Arnold were the two best things about the movie. A half assed attempt to maybe just cash in on a legacy. Not very respectful too, some rules are suddenly changed. No wonder James Cameron himself dismissed/denied every sequel after T2.In retrospect T4 is much and much more enjoyable, just makes a more lasting impact, not that that movie was really good. In fact I dislike T3 the most. A bland meaningless and pretty meh sci-fi movie that happens to use 'Skynet' and 'Terminator' in the mediocre script. Only watch this film if you just can't get enough of 'Terminator' and need some extra episodes of filler. The first two are the classics, for good reason.Anthology ranking:1. T2 (9+)

776,StarWarsNut8728,AWESOME....,5,4 July 2003,"I saw this movie on the first day it came out! It was awesome, entertaining, I understood the storyline(Why the T-X was killing off people in the beginning, etc.), and I thought it was very Interesting, the action scenes were better than Terminator 2: Judgment Day's. The only faults in this movie is that it wasn't directed by James Cameron and that James Cameron didn't write it. The Visual Effects were superb although some of them did look a little fake, but so did Terminator 2's T-1000, it looked fake, so I'm not going to gripe about the Visual Effects. I feel the visual effects are needed to fabricate scenes that are too hard for the actors to do and is also needed to make a great film(take The Lord of the Rings films for instance) but, there are instances when Directors go a little to far with the Visual Effects in their films. Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is a great film, great acting (still by Ol' Arnold Schwarzeneggar, of course), great action scenes, and great storyline. When watching this film I got a sense of deja vu because if anybody has seen The Animatrix it sort of talks about Nuclear War also(just my opinion). Does anyone agree? Well the rating on the IMDB website for Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines should go up because I think it deserves a better rating than a 7.3/10, may be a 7.8/10, at least. Well those are my thoughts and Feelings about this film, thank You for reading.

There were many questions unanswered in T2, but some where answered in T3. I was surprised by the ending. I don't want to be a spoiler so I won't say much.Of the three movies I believe that this is the best one. You have to go see it, no question.There is some speculation that there might be a fourth movie. I sure hope not, because after the way T3 ended I don't see how it could possibly be followed by a fourth.

778,majekowski,This movie is Action-Packed,8,1 July 2003,"T3 is an awesome film. The story may not be as in depth as the first two, (I suppose because James Cameron had nothing to do with it) but has enough Action to keep you entertained. The beginning has a brief rehash of the first two but then starts right into the story. The Action begins minutes after it starts and keeps going. Once the scene is over, they may talk for a couple minutes and then BAM, right back to the action. this movie must have cost a fortune just making a couple of the scenes.

779,ManonMoon,Superfluous movie,5,22 December 2004,"T1 was great, T2 a worthy sequel but T3.....? I don't know where to start, is it the non-existing plot, the bad acting or the ignorance of details which I disliked most? There are so many senseless moments that I just name a few of them: There is a scene where the T-X is lying on the roof of a car with her target John Conor sitting inside. As we see in almost every scene the pure strength and power of T-X is incredible, so what should be easier than simply destroying the roof and killing John Connor? But what is she doing? Relaxing on the roof (maybe she wanted to get a tan) and trying to saw the roof. I mean, why not pushing through the roof? A really big flaw in the story: after Skynet has taken over control robots kill all people in the military base and control the entire building. Only John Connor and his future wife survive, find a plane and fly away. Fly away? Where have all the robots gone??? Also it was interesting to learn that coffins and cars are bulletproof by default. And so it goes on and on.... Of course the special effects were good. The best one was definitely to let Arnold look like as if the last 20 years did not happen. He really didn't give the impression to be 50something.Nevertheless I give it a 5 because the action is quite entertaining. Unfortunately there is no single moment where T3 can hold the standard set by its 2 predecessors.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
780,andyb-13,Terminally terrible. Terminally tedious. Save your cash. Avoid.,3,19 August 2003,"This is just a rerun of T2 but without the plot or excitement. It is literally one long car chase, the fallback of the terminally unimaginative director. A poor script doesn't help the hapless Nick Stahl while it's left to Clare Danes to bring at least some emotional depth to the film. Arnie does what Arnie does and is no better or worse than usual.Overall, the film lacks the menace and leaness of previous Terminator movies and although the ending is genuinely moving, there really is little point in carrying on the franchise. A poor end to what were some genuinely groundbreaking and iconic movies.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
781,agorelik,Extremely Mediocre,5,21 December 2004,"Above all, this movie even failed to create (for me) any real sense of urgency or excitement. Which is the essential point behind an action movie.Some of the problems inherent in Terminator 3 1. Essentially, the plot is wrong. Terminator 3 negates the positive vision of the previous two movies (that Sarah and John Connor can prevent or at least seriously influence the future). T3 abandons that vision for a entirely fatalistic one (that, in fact, Judgement Day cannot be prevented or even really influenced).2. The timing and pacing of the movie just seem off. The car cash sequence runs on too long, the battle in the bathroom runs on too long, the robo-tanks are boring, the Skynet ""planes"" are easily destroyed, etc.3. The new Terminatrix is essentially the same as T-1000 in T2, so she's literally boring, whereas the T-1000 is really new and exciting in T2. You're frequently surprised by the T-1000 in T2 whereas you're just bored by the Terminatrix in T3. The acting by Robert Patrick was quite good (really effective in being scary and mechanical), whereas Kristana Loken is just.........well, I just wasn't scared or even impressed.4. The plot was muddled so that it felt both boring (repeats in many aspects T2) and just messy, so you never really felt the suspense which was very pronounced in the first two movies.5. Claire Danes was a poor substitute for Linda Hamilton. Again, Linda Hamilton brought an unusual range of depth of emotion for an action movie. Claire Danes was just your archetypal cardboard damsel in distress.6. The action sequences were simply not that impressive. If you notice, while in T1 and T2, the characters were really fighting for their lives - they're wounded, bloody, covered in debris and sweat, really battered. In T3, the only thing the hero John Connor suffers is that the Terminatrix breaks his leg at the very end of the movie. Kate Brewster isn't even scratched. You never get the sense that their lives are truly in danger. In fact, the Terminatrix and John Connor only come face to face twice (both for extremely short segments) and she doesn't even wound him (until the very end of the movie).Overall, this was a really mediocre movie.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

The chip and the arm of the first Terminator was destroyed and it's certainly my impression that Cameron didn't want a third movie.It was disappointing that Mostow thought he could get away with inventing the claim that Judgment Day was ""only postponed"" by the events of Sarah and John Connor in what was 1995 in the story, and I was disappointed, that's the only word, that the Terminator trilogy ended with the end of mankind and the rise of the machines. It's kind of a bad ending, and audiences don't like them.Loyal Terminator fans would feel they have to see this sequel, but to anyone who hasn't done yet, if I were you, just watch the 1984 original and 1991 sequel, ""Judgment Day"". I feel that a bad sequel brings down the reputation of the whole saga, and that shouldn't be the case, because the first two Terminators were among the greatest films ever.

784,SecondOpinion,I wasn't disappointed at all,8,21 December 2003,"I am a true Terminator series fan, and T2 in particular is one of my favorite movies of all time. So did I have incredibly high expectations for T3? Well, no.. First of all, Cameron wasn't directing, so that kind of lowered the expectations quite a bit. Secondly, I was even somewhat sceptic about the story they had come up with. How would they explain this  with regard to what happened in T2. Well, I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised. The story made sense and whatever questions one might have had about SkyNet and why they keep sending terminators were answered satisfactorily. (Ok, so time travel movies always allow for alternative plots, but hey, it's Hollywood entertainment, not quantum physics) The special effects were top-notch, but then you wouldn't expect less from the sequel to T2, a true milestone in CGI. If anything, this movie was too short. It lacked the ""epic"" feel of T2. Arnold was good as he always is in the Terminator movies, the others were decent enough I guess. The movie was funny and I enjoyed the fact that Arnold doesn't take himself too seriously. Strangely enough, I noticed that most T2 fans were satisfied with T3 while ""ordinary"" people (non T2 geeks :-) tended to be more disappointed. I guess it has a lot to do with personal expectations.

Having to go through what he did in T2 is understandable.Now onto Kristanna Loken - she is one beautiful woman and she stayed true to the robotic script. Loved her!The script is not bad either.

787,drew_starr,"Doesn't terminate the first two, but still great",7,26 August 2004,"The third (and final???) installment in the Terminator trilogy brings events rate up to date and sees the birth of Skynet and the story of judgment day, and the efforts to prevent it. Without James Cameron the film lacks the finesse and tghtness of the first two films, it doesn't have the same feel, and it lacks Cameron's guiding hand. Luckily Big Arnie is on top form giving one of his better performances, probably his best film since True Lies, returning in same same role, albeit as a different Terminator unit from the same series model. This time the enemy is the immensely brutal and advanced T-X, played superbly by Kristianna Loken, who manages to combine sultry seductiveness with ruthless brutal killing seemingly effortlessly.Claire Danes, who does a fine job as Kate Brewster, a vetinary nurse who is unfortunately drawn into the war against the machines, and her performance is first rate. The script is nice, it has a few holes in it but mostly holds together OK, there are a few nice twists, especially the history of Arnie's Terminator, and the rise of Skynet is very nicely explained with a very good showing of 'American generals and politicians as morons' - watch it you'll like it.The let down of the film for me is Nick Stahl as John Conner, who gives an average performance and fails to bring much energy and depth to the character who had great potential and was played expertly by Edward Furlong in T2. In T3 Conner is a lost and selfish character hiding from nothing but himself, and there is no way to connect this John Conner with the young Conner in T2, or the resistance leader he was to become. Eddie's young Conner had a brash rebellious nature and you could see how Conner could become the leader of the human resistance to the machines, but Nick Stahl's portrayal just falls flat and doesn't impress. A nice cameo from the ever brilliant Earl Boen as Dr Silberman makes a nice comedy moment, and the sporadic light comic relief from Arnie makes the film more bearable. A shame that Linda Hamilton didn't wasn't in the film, though the character is included to make a good comedy and quintisentially Sarah Conner moment.Overall T3 is good, it doesn't have the same impact that the original film had, nor the dynamic fast paced story of T2. The film suffers from 'third in trilogy syndrome', where all the best ideas have been put into the first two and the third film is just trying to grind out the idea (see Aliens 3, Police Academy 3 onwards, etc) but everything is saved by Arnie's brilliant performance as the Terminator. Final statements - as a member of the Terminator series, it isn't as good as the first two. Had the first two never been made, or perhaps if this was the second film, not the third, it could have been called great. Its very good if viewed as a separate film, merely good when considered in the trilogy. Will there be a T4 when Arnie finishes his term as governor Terminator? Anything is possible, but judging from T3, somehow someway James Cameron will need to be convinced to work on the project.

Few franchises have enough steam to get to #3 without a misstep ... frankly, I can't think of any other examples.But T3 breaks the trilogy curse. The smartest move the filmmakers made was deciding not to try to outdo T2. T2 is an epic masterpiece, and trying to take that to the next level would have been near impossible. Instead, that brought things down a notch, made a smaller story, added more humor.The result is a small, wonderful film. Well, relatively small anyway. It still delivers on the action -- the big chase scene code be the greatest car chase ever committed to film.

I hate to be negative, but I'm not sure what his appeal was to the casting directors - his acting skills were subpar (didn't seem emotionally connected enough at times) and he seemed sooo different from the younger John Conner they had in the second Terminator movie. I didn't find it believable that they were supposed to be the same person. There'd been all this build up to ""the great John Conner"" over the previous Terminator movies, but I was so underwhelmed by this actor. Linda Hamilton's absence is also greatly felt. Maybe she could've helped carry the movie - Clare Danes and the guy who played John Conner just can't pull it off in my opinion. Schwarzenegger is perfect for comedic effect, but he's not really ever the protagonist in these movies in the traditional sense, even though the series was named for his character. He was the best part of this movie; it's saving grace, I guess. Overall, it's an okay movie, but the first two Terminator movies were way better.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
795,hot_action_ninja,Had the misfortune of having to live up to it's predecessors' impossibly high standards,5,4 July 2010,"Standards which it could never achieve, and wasn't really meant to anyways. As a brainless action flick, it's very well made. The crane chase, no matter how implausible, was amazing and is easily one of the best chase scenes of the decade. The film's main problem, for me at least, is that it spends it's best action scene too early on in the film, and everything that came afterwards was just OK. Still, it's a good action film, and I believe people have come to respect it more after witnessing the travesty that was Terminator Salvation. Just don't go mentioning T3 in the same breath as it's predecessors.PROS: -Crane chase, crane chase, crane chase! Brilliantly set up and shot, and incredibly thrilling. This is the one point where T3 almost matches the heights of the first two films, and what it SHOULD be remembered for. Yes, it is highly implausible, but that's not the point.-Arnold is amusing, almost playing a parody version of his previous Terminator roles. You can tell he had fun.-Kristanna Loken makes for a good villainess. She doesn't even touch Robert Patrick, but she brings enough menace to the table to actually feel like a reasonable threat.-Ending. I'm not gonna spoil it but it is fittingly dark. Gotta give the director props for not coping out on it.CONS: -Nick Stahl. Dull. Flat. Boring -Claire Danes. Dull. Flat. Boring-The scale/size and quality of the action scenes following the crane chase took a big nose-dive. They are OK, but that's just it. Only OK does not pass in a Terminator film. I get the feeling that most of the film's budget went towards the crane chase, as everything else feels lackluster by comparison.-This is the biggest flaw for me. The musical score. Where in the hell did that AMAZING and GOD-LIKE score from T2 go? No, those are not overstatements. T2 literally had one of the greatest scores in film history (Brad Fiedel's masterpiece), and I'm just dumbfounded that the creators of T3 seemed completely oblivious to this fact, because T3 has an almost non-existent score. What actually is there is very flat, dull, and BORING. Why oh why did they not try harder in this department?In closing, Terminator 3 would have gotten MUCH more praise had it not been a Terminator film. 7/10 for this entertaining blockbuster.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
796,MitchHellman,Thankfully NOT a blockbuster movie (some spoilers),8,6 July 2003,"Compared to some of the other movies released this summer (such as Matrix Reloaded and The Hulk) the hype machine was not running full-bore for T3, in my opinion. As a result, I found myself more able to appreciate the movie's strengths without much in the way of pre-conceived notions getting in the way.Rather than a total deconstruction of T3, I'd rather just mention what I liked about it:1. First and foremost-- the ending. I was worried that T3 would continue with the plot point established in the first two Terminator movies: that the Terminator was sent through time to prevent the awful future from taking place. Not only was this done to death in the others in the series, but was the whole point behind the Back to the Future trilogy (only the result in that series was much more clever). It was a welcome change to see this dealt with in a different way, one that echoes some of the essential pessimism of T2.2. While in general I agree with other comments in this forum that the portrayal of the T-X lacked some of the feeling of menace of Robert Patrick's performance in T2, Kristanna Loken managed to capture and reproduce many of Patrick's mannerisms: the sideways tilt of the head, the eyes looking upward while the head was lowered, etc. It gave me the impression that they both were programmed with the same instruction set.3. With the exception of the pneumatic breast scene (which was basically there for laughs), the T-X did NOT infiltrate and further her goals by means of sexuality-- a departure from most SF movies featuring superhuman females.4. Though there was a different director and Linda Hamilton did not appear, I felt that there was a strong effort made to keep the story consistent with the rest of the Terminator mythos. For example: the tank-like machines that were activated by the Terminatrix also appeared in one or more of the Terminator video games that have been made over the years since T2. I appreciate this attention to detail.All in all, I got my money's worth. It was entertaining but was (blessedly) not a huge, overblown megablockbuster movie. Loud, though.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
797,Ross-17,Wasn't needed but worth a look.,7,9 July 2003,"Was this film needed? No. James Cameron wrapped up the story at the end of T2, the only way the story could be continued is to reverse the logic of the first two films, There's no fate but what we make ourselves becomes you cannot change your fate only postpone it. No matter how many terminators travel back and fail there'll always be another one coming.Accepting it wasn't needed this film does stand up well against the usual action fare. Make no mistake though it isn't a patch on the original Terminator films. It lacks the bone crunching energy of the first two underscoring that Cameron is the master of action films.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
798,dominic-9,Faster la Vista Baby,8,2 July 2003,"First of all you should see this film before reading any reviews, not because I'm going to give you any spoilers but simply because this is a very enjoyable movie and worth seeing before discussing. This is a film that loves being a sequel and there are not many third outings that come anywhere close to the first two movies usually. In many respects T3 is more similar in tone to Alien 3 than any other sequel, in that you get the impression that Mostow has gone out of his way to not only include the jaw dropping action of T2: Judgment Day, but also the pure Tech-Noir quality of the 1984 original and although he can't top either of these classics he gets a pretty good combination effect. With a new Terminator we get new plays on favorite jokes (don't you remember Hasta la Vista?'), new twists on familiar routines (such as the naked Arnie appearing in time for ladies night) coupled with a sense of dread and uncertainty that fits with the current fears of an unstoppable military power. Nick Stahl (as John Conner) who looks like he wondered out of Detour' (US/1945) is a deadbeat on a motorbike eking an existence on the road from town to town, he feels that the apocalyptic future he was destined to be part of has been avoided, but has left him without a purpose. Then Arnie shows up and informs him that Judgment Day is round the corner. Can he stop it this time? Is he still the savior? With Kate Brewster (Claire Danes) as (surely more than love interest!) an initially unwilling accomplice, they try to avert the coming Armageddon and outrun the T-X (Kristanna Loken) an upgraded liquid metal Terminator in NEW ultra deadly Scandinavian female form! As many other critics have pointed out there is a lot more humor in this film and Mostow may not have the masterstroke quality of James Cameron BUT he knows what this franchise is all about:       1.   Trading in on Arnies' one-dimensional UberMensch acting style for all it's worth. He still looks fantastic and you can really revel in his juggernaut bravado.       2.   Countering his nonhuman persona with the more human characters through humor (of which there is plenty) but more importantly independent thinking (limited as that is for Arnie) 3.	The look, the style and the feel of a leather jacket (as epitomized by the choice of clothing of both Terminators) and cool dark shades. There are a few misfires from this Uzi of a movie however but nothing that misses the central body mass. The main one being is why Claire Danes in this film? You can see that she's really struggling to get something more out of her character from every tragedy that hits her, but she just gets swept away by the next spectacular set piece. The music is dull but unobtrusive so loss there and some of the deeply meaningful dialogue moments feel like they were lifted from a daytime soap. Arnie gets in some good one liners, some of them on target but quite a few off center and that's something you feel Cameron would have left on the cutting room floor) All in all though this is the exemplary expensive summer movie you would expect with a lot of thrills and a lot of laughs. Mostow however has a put a devil of a knot in the tail of this movie and he may not be James Cameron but he deserves more credit for pulling it off with an elegiac grace.(Vote: 8/10)",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
799,Cyanide-5,Excellent,10,7 July 2003,"I must admit that I was not expecting a tremendous movie when I went to see T3. I was happily surprised at how fast paced and fun this movie was straight off the bat.  There was some great suspense as I found myself asking of the maincharacters: ""How are you going to get away from the T-X now?""  Kristanna did a great job at playing the hard-core, cold-hearted killer that every Terminator should be.  She was brutal and efficient, and best of all never stopped in the middle of killing someone in order to explain her master plan.   I like that in a villain.  Arnold was once again amazing as the protector, and Nick and Claire were fantastic as his suporting cast.  I highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see an action-packed flick that has some great twists and turns. The ending is also perfect for the ideas and theories the story conveys about fate and free will.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
800,mf3177,He's Back!,8,2 July 2003,"In Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines, a film series is established that I never thought should have been established.  I've ranted in depth on my thoughts on The Terminator and its sequel on my webpage, and my hatred for the existence of said sequel should have been a deterrent in my preparation to see T3.  But my appetite for big-budget Schwarzenegger vehicles is one that must be fed, and Terminator 3 is the best tasting film Arnold's made in a while.James Cameron moved on after directing the first two films, and the reigns are now taken by Jonathan Mostow.  Mostow wowed me previously with Breakdown, a B Movie so simple in plot and so tight in action that it held me in its grasp from opening to close.   Terminator 3 is definitely from the same mold.  The pacing is perfect, the action scenes are relentless, and the philosophical banter (thankfully there's little of it.I was petrified this would turn in to another Matrix Reloaded) is simple and fitting.  Mostow knows that a film like this, like a sorority babe, will not be looked at for its brains.This isn't a bad thing.  The script allows Arnold to appear much more like a machine than the first sequel, limiting him to short lines that are usually so corny they work beautifully.  The aging Schwarzenegger shows that he has not lost his ability to carry an action film, although the lack of action from his character leaves us wondering how much is left in Arnold's tank. Hopefully we find out the answer in a different role.  More on that later.Among the other key players, Nick Stahl (from In the Bedroom, which is an excellent movie) shines while taking over the role of John Conner, the future hero who needs protection.  The transition from the wide-eyed youth of Edward Furlong to the unaccepting adult is hard at first, but in the end Stahl's Conner is right on the money.  Claire Danes joins the fray as the love interest who also must be saved for mankind's sake, and is sufficient in her role.The most publicized addition to the franchise has been Kristanna Loken as the female nemesis of the Terminator, the TX.  The TX model is much more impressive looking under fire than the similar model in T2.  I know many people will regard this as blasphemous, but that liquid metal on Robert Patrick looked LAME!  The TX has all the powers of her predecessor, but looks a lot better doing it.  I'm referring mostly to the special effects, but yeah, the female aspect is cool to see too.The success however, lies in the direction.  Like Breakdown, Mostow masterfully crafts a film that manages to be both laid-back and wound-up at the same time, feeling simple in plot and hypercharged in activity.  It's not a masterpiece in any shape or form, but it did what I thought it could not - It made me care about John Conner again while keeping me gazing at the pretty explosions and collisions for almost two hours.
I can't recommend Terminator 3 flat out.  It's too simple to be called anything more than a popcorn flick, and too basic in its action scenes to be called revolutionary in that aspect.  It does add some basic determinism for flavor, and there is a deeper message. But, in truth, T3 seems simply like a remix of the ideas that were used to make T2.  But it's a remix that doesn't succumb to too much `intelligence' like T2 did.  This is no substitute for the original.  But if I have to choose between the sequels, I'll take the powderkeg that is Terminator 3 in a heartbeat over the flashbomb that is Terminator 2.  Check it out.P.S. - Love the Ending.  It had to take a lot of balls to put that on the screen.  Should be a fitting end to the series.I hope.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

803,LennyNero,T-3 had better not risen,5,7 August 2003,"After a lot of quite positive critics about Terminator 3 and many positive reviews I thought that maybe T-3 would not be so bad as I had imagined. When it finally was released in Germany I was eager to see it on the opening day. I shouldn't have... T-3 is an average action movie but nothing extraordinary. Judged by its predecessors T-3 is inferior in every respect. T-3 neither has the dark atmosphere of the first Terminator nor the epic size of T-2. Okay, maybe one could not expect that, but at least I expected a serious treatment of the heir. However, the first 15 minutes seem to be a parody on T-2 (as if Jerry/David Zucker& Jim Abrahams had directed the bar-scence) and this really annoyed me. Also, the often praised car chase is not as impressive as the one in Reloaded. But that is not the point. The real problem is, that the Terminator is mocked and ridiculed in my opinion and the T-X seems by far not as dangerous as the T-1000 or Schwarzenegger in T-1. Where Cameron created a dark and dense atmosphere, strong characters + state-of-the-art action sequences T-3 hurries from one scene to the next without spending time on the characters or the story. Well, if you liked T-3 it is okay, but I do not think that anyone who loves the first two installments will be really satisfied with Mostows creation.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

I know Furlong has had issues and his career has suffered for it...but I hate when they re-cast such an important character. Nick Stahl, whom they got as a replacement did a great job, but I hate the lack continuity from previous movies and I thought about it while watching - which isn't good.Kristanna Loken as T-X. I feel like she just wasn't believable as a killer robot-Terminator. She just didn't look menacing enough & it left me wanting more.Positives were -Good story evolution from the previous movie.Claire Danes as Kate Brewster. She is just a good actress and did a nice job here.Arnold again was made for this role.They took good advantage of 2003 CGI.

The movie was on the verge of being terrible and a huge waste of time, but was redeemed slightly by the ending (and the car chase scene was pretty sweet).  Other than that, this movie was lacking in several of the areas where the first two movies succeeded... innovative special effects, tangible suspense,  well thought out, purposefully corny dialogue, Linda Hamilton...Anyway, while I wouldn't recommend anyone going out and spending money on this movie, if you happen to have the chance to see it for free, or if it's on TV in the future, and there's nothing else on, it might be a quasi-worthwhile way to spend ~2 hours.  If you haven't seen the first two movies, then T3 might even be considered pretty good.... but if you haven't seen the first two movies, your money and time would be better spent renting those, and not really bothering with this one...",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
807,tehkao,Very fast paced action plus a good story,9,8 July 2003,"Terminator 3 is a very effective, tightly edited, and polished action movie. You feel that every second of the 109 minutes of this film was used effectively and not wasted. There is very little ""downtime"". There is always something important going on or being said.A lot has been said about the humor in this movie. Some think it's too much and ruins the dark ""feel"" that Terminator movies are supposed to have, but others don't mind the humor as much. I'm sort of on the fence on this one. On one hand I find the humor very clever and well done, but on the other hand it seems out of place in a movie that deals with such a dark theme and storyline (the end of the world). But in a way the occasional jokes help alleviate the overall gloomy mood of the film.The movie is also a contrast of two parts: the first hour is full of one liners and gags, but the 2nd half is deadly serious and even depressing.But the bottom line is, the movie keeps you entertained throughout and I think that's the most important thing. It also tells a very crucial chapter in the whole Terminator ""saga"", that of the genesis of Skynet and the ""rise of the machines"". It's a story that was begging to be told ever since Terminator 2, and I'm so glad we finally got it and it was executed so brilliantly. The ending was also surprisingly more emotional and touching than I ever expected.Compared to its predecessors T1 and T2, I give T3 a very respectable 8 out of 10. Comparing it to most modern action movies, I give it a 10 out of 10. T3 is a throwback to the glory days of sci-fi action movies of the 80's and 90's. It's filled with one-liners, tells an engrossing story, pays attention to detail, while throwing in a lot of gratuitous explosions and destruction.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
808,TheWakingFalcoln,James Cameron had nothing to do with this...and you can tell.,1,6 January 2008,"""The future is not set. There is No Fate but what we make for ourselves. I wish I could believe that...but I don't."" The very opening words of this movie set up the attitude that it has towards the two movies that came before it: ""Ya know those brilliant films that James Cameron created? We're gonna throw it all out the window."" Action movies are often not very memorable. The reason behind this, I believe, is because those involved forget about character and story in favor of special effects. They regard character and story, the two most important elements, as an unfortunate necessity in story structure to give their filmed action sequences some semblance of coherence.James Cameron did what only a select few action movie directors have done: he remembered that character and story are what make the action memorable. The best action sequences are ones where you care about who's going to win, who's going to lose, who's going to survive, and who's going to die. You have to get your audience to care about the heroes so that the action actually has meaning beyond showing off your sky-high budget.Like I said, so few directors actually remember that, especially as time goes on. Michael Bay forgot about that when he made TRANSFORMERS. Cory Yuen forgot about that when he made THE TRANSPORTER. And Jonathan Mostow forgot it in TERMINATOR 3: RISE OF THE MACHINES.The story's basic enough. John Connor didn't stop Judgement Day after all. He just postponed it.There. That does it. Basically, the first two movies become meaningless with this movie around because they throw away the ""No Fate"" concept that was integral to the first two movies. But why is ""No Fate"" not true? Could they think of a logical, thought-provoking reason? No. The reason they came up with is, ""Because we need another movie."" John Connor? Unlike Edward Furlong's portrayal, which showed a young, courageous, compassionate, intelligent, punk-attitude wiz kid who could easily be seen leading the Human Resistance years from now, Nich Stahl (a good actor with a bad script) shows a John Connor who cries and complains at every turn and does nothing remotely heroic throughout the entire movie.The Terminator? Although Arnold once created one of the most menacing villains in the history of the silver screen, and later a computer-programmed killer capable of learning and caring, here he is reduced to a one-line spouting source of ""comic"" relief.I prefer to think that this tarnish to Cameron's legacy was never made.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

And to top it all off, the couple of Arnie one-liners were actually funny. Kristanna Løken, aka T-X Teminatrix, was absolutely awesome!  She really nailed the part.

Take the good music, good acting, and all the cool stuff in the first two Terminators and you'll get an idea of what this movie is about.

813,martin197,Probably better than Robocop3...,5,26 April 2004,"T3, ""Rise of the Machines"" is for me that rarest of films - one that I like less with each viewing. That's not to say that it is without redeeming features - it has for example one of the most breathtaking vehicle sequences I can remember seeing - but the writing is generally more like poor fan fiction than a genuine third installment in the series.MAJOR SPOILERS FOLLOWOn the whole I don't obsess over details between franchise movies, but the abandonment of ""no fate but what we make"" in favour of an inevitable Judgement Day counts as something more than a detail. John Connor's newfound fatalism is neither particularly believable in view of his history - after all, he *knows* that JD can at least be successfully postponed - nor is it necessary to the plot, since the core of that was lifted straight from its predecessor anyway. This isn't a new movie, so much as a bad case of ""well if *I'd* written T2, *I'd* have done it this way"". The relentless series of joky back references don't help either, in a film that seems unable to decide whether it wants to be homage, parody or a new perspective on the Terminator story.Once you start to dislike a movie, the plot holes start to annoy you out of all proportion. How does the T-X's ability to manipulate other computers translate to an ability to remotely control vehicles' steering and transmission? Why was the facility that Kate Brewster's father worked out of on such secure military projects, completely unguarded? Why did he have a private plane there? What happened to the laws of motion (particularly the bit about ""equal and opposite reaction"") during the cartoonish battle of the Terminators in the washroom? What inspired Connor to fire up the 'particle accelerator' and above all, how the hell did he know how to? How come the T-X, which was so badly affected by the (rather disturbing) external magnetic field from the accelerator that her metal was being stripped from her frame was able to wrench an arm away, form an apparently motorised (i.e. magnetic field dependent) saw with a small blade and damage the accelerator enough to escape? Why was an emergency bunker, apparently designed to protect the most senior members of government in the event of war, fully powered up but completely unmanned? How does Arnie manage to restrain the more powerful T-X with both his fuel cells removed? Eventually you start to ask ""why did I just spend the last 100 minutes of my life watching this stuff?""The answer is, just so long as you can disengage your brain and watch it for the spectacle, it's a pretty slick show. There's chases and explosions and a cute, blonde and decidedly female villain and just occasionally those back references are amusing. And at least it avoids the problems of franchises like Robocop, where the main character went from virtually indestructible supercyborg in the first movie to spending more time being repaired than fighting crime in the third. These terminators are still determinedly solid killing machines, even if the film does seem to think it has more to say than is really the case.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

815,Quincey_P_Morris,Perfect Summer Movie (Minor Spoilers),9,5 July 2003,"Minor SpoilersTerminator 3 is exactly the type of movie that I like to see as part of the summer blockbuster season. It's loaded with incredible looking action, it's humorous , and it has a huge cheese factor. The storyline is only used just to get to the next explosion or the next joke. But even so, for the most part the story seemed right on par with the previous installments, and at the ending, it completely took off and a classic was born.In a huge departure from the previous installments, director Jonathan Mostow has taken the James Cameron-abandoned franchise and made it his own with a very exciting and thrilling film. I thought the ending of T3 was simply amazing and such a welcome change from the 'happy' ending that follows so many of the summer movies. Very courageous of Mostow as well, I might add.The films titanic budget is all up there on the screen and was used to great effect (minus Arnie's $30 million take of course).The action in this movie is truly the show stopper here. The sequence with the upending crane truck was absolutely staggering and completely blew my mind. The best car chase scene I have ever scene (or at least the most destructive). The hearse sequence, is also very noteworthy. The action sequences never let up and really demonstrate just how far along the advances in CGI, animatronics, and even make-up have come. Kudos to the always excellent work by Stan Winston with his T-X design and fully-functioning T-1 robots.I think that what many of the negative reviewers of this film take issue with is the lack of subtle humor that was so prevalent in the first two movies. The comedy was put into overdrive for this film, as Arnie delivers more one-liners than ever, some of them absolutely atrocious. But if you can just laugh them off, you'll still be in for a great ride. The humourous cameo by Dr. Silberman was a nice touch.Schwarzenegger however to my surprise, is still very convincing as the cybernetic organism that he first played almost twenty years ago, and his physique for the most part is as it was back in 1984, although he does look a little smaller. Kristanna Loken did a great job too as the female T-X, but I still think that Robert Patrick as the merciless T-1000 is still the most ruthless of the villain Terminators.Nick Stahl and Claire Danes as John Connor and Kate Brewster respectively, also put in decent performances. Connor does look like a grungy vagrant, but a liquid metal terminator coming through the future ten years ago solely to kill you, is bound to be somewhat traumatic for the guy, and might just cause him to live an alternate lifestyle.All in all, a very entertaining popcorn flick. Highly recommended if you enjoy action movies, or the Terminator film franchise (if you can digest some minor plot holes). I can't wait for the DVD, and I hope that T4 gets the greenlight too, with Mostow once again at the helm.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
816,dereth,Good...,6,11 July 2003,"... but not as good as Terminator 2.Basically, it's kinda like seeing the other 2 Terminator movies again. Very refreshing, but I still think T-2 is better overall. :)Extra point, the T-X doesn't seem to be as formidable as the T-1000. Not logical.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
817,movieguttx95,A good movie,7,12 June 2009,"Unlike most people, i actually enjoyed this movie. It was action packed and fun. However, it's definitely not better than T2 or T1. I will point out though that for the TX being the most advanced Terminator ever built, she didn't seem as much of a villain as the T-1000 from T2 did. I thought that the comedic moments they put in were a little unnecessary to. Overall, if you're just looking for a decent action flick and not expecting this to be amazing, then you should definitely pick this up because it can be enjoyable. However, if you're expecting it to be as good as the first 2 Terminator films, then you're going to be disappointed. It's just an average film, but it can be a lot of fun to watch.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
818,ixzer,A Worthy Addition to the Terminator series,8,2 July 2003,"Warning: Spoilers AheadAfter 12 years since the classic T-2, Rise of the Machines has finally been unleashed into the marketplace. However much is missing from this film and that essential element is JAMES CAMERON himself. For the previous Terminator films, Cameron has provided his name to the credits of writer, producer and director. With his complete absence from the third installment, hardcore fans will definitely notice the change in style for T-3. This comes as both a positive and a negative. T-3 does not come close to being as good as T-2, however it is still a solid movie on its own. Its action is exciting and well executed, and it's visual and sound effects are far above average. However the presence of Cameron's humour and action is sorely missed. Perhaps this is because we were so used to him being attached to the first two films that with the addition of Jonathan Mostow instead as director, things just feel a little too different. I suppose one could compare this to Steven Spielberg's departure from Jurassic Park 3 (Lost World sucked, so maybe he was just being smart, but Jurassic Park 3 was the better movie overall). Jurassic Park 3 was handled by Joe Johnston instead and with its brisk running time, the action and humour was quick and fun. T-3 has the same feel to it. Its story is not as gripping and the human emotion is not as strong as T-1 or T-2. But credit must be given to the writers and director for their attempts at matching Cameron's previous works. This film serves as an addition to Sequel Summer 2003, but it's a better than average sequel for the most part.The acting is decent for a Sci-Fi action film and as stated before, the action and visual/sound effects will keep you entertained. The humour from the three main central cast members of Arnold, Nick Stahl, and Claire Danes is just right (Arnold's one linear are for the most part fun, but maybe a little too used towards the end of the film.). The film is also not overly long, perhaps clocking in at exactly 120 minutes.My only major problem with the film was its musical score by Marco Beltrami. I don't understand at all why Brad Fiedel was not used again to compose and conduct the musical score. His transition from T-1 to T-2 was amazing. The new score is not horrible; it's just not memorable at all. I left the theater missing the Terminator overture (however it is played during the end credits with less effect than the touching finale in T-2.)Another oddity was ""Where exactly did Arnie get the shotgun from?"" We see him get his clothes, but when he first arrives to save Katherine Brewster, he is suddenly blasting away at the T-X. An easy mistake like this would have been avoided by Cameron. This is not a big deal, but before watching T-3, I viewed T-1 and T-2 again, and Cameron was quite careful with subtle details. Perhaps a deleted scene with commentary will clear this up, but this sort of problem gives way to the notion ""This movie is pretty clean cut in terms of technicalities, but because of that one noticeable error, it annoys me.""As for the T-X, I thought she was a sexy robot assassin; however I could not help but feel her improvements as a Terminator were just modified for coolness and not for killing efficiency. T-X does not hold a candle to the T-1000 in terms of presence. For the most part, Kristanna Loken's attempt as a Terminator was well attempted, but falls flat. I never felt intimidated by her and she didn't have that poker face look that Robert Patrick had when asking ""Are you the legal guardians of John Connor?'I kept myself in the dark for T-3. I didn't want to ruin it for myself. I didn't follow any news from its official website or read magazine articles. I even felt that the trailers and TV spots were poor. But upon watching the film in theaters on opening day, I was satisfied with the end product. It was just a fun film to watch. I wish the film luck in breaking even with its $170 million U.S. budget.8/10",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

I went to the cinema with a foreboding feeling that this might be one of those movies only made to squeeze the last drops of gold out of a winning concept. I was very glad to learn that this was not the case. After getting used to Nick Stahl (sweet-faced actor that I personally only remember in ""softer"" roles) in the part of future freedomfighter John Connor, the movie took off and I only sat back and enjoyed. Ok, yes, the classic lines now feel more like a joke among T-lovers and induced the audience to laughter more than to a feeling of something cool, but the winning concept goes on winning! Classic Terminator action of good quality mixed with good humor and some new turns, like the female terminator T-X (Kristanna Loken) and the time set to the last day of humankind as we know it...or is it??? The end raises a question in my mind: Will there be a number 4?

Its easier to go by the textbook and make $300 million.There was some attempt at bringing up what life meant to a machine, but it didnt get far.This movie is also good at conviently forgetting what happens when an innocent person is killed.Cinimatically, the only cool shots came in the last couple minutes of film.And really, please dont make a T4 even though you left it wide open for one.

I kid you not, take John Woo and Jerry Bruckhemier and put them together for a movie, this is what you'll have. Except....for one thing, one little thing i must mention is the charecter development.  There could've been a little more defintion of explaining of the characters, but if you saw the previous two movies, then there's really no need for the development.  This is the only thing i can think of that i could mention. Everything else about the movie was great, Arnold look great for being 55+ years old.  When you see him, I think he could do another 10 years of action movies.  I may sound crazy, but wait till you see him.

827,Wookiee-Monster,Too short a film? Perhaps it's just me,9,2 July 2003,"I was hoping to see X2 but apparently it's already out of the theaters. Shows ya how often I get out.I'm surprised that the theater wasn't jam-packed - I walked right in and hardly anyone was there at the 8 PM showing.I thoroughly enjoyed this film with Nick Stahl (John Connor).  He portrayed Connor as I believe he should have been, but won't give any spoilers as yesterday was the first showing.  He definitely out-acted the pubescent Connor in T2.  Just the lack of the squeaky cracking voice was reason enough to like him! LOLI can't say that Kristanna Loken (T-X) really had the latitude to do much with this role what with it being an emotionally void machine, but then again Arnold's T-100(?) had a lot more personality, if you will.  I don't think this is a 'spoiler' but I kept noticing how perfect Loken's T-X looked regardless of how often she met physical impacts - not a single hair was out of place!  I know, it's because she was a machine meant to look that way. Actually, I found it commendable that the production crew made certain that particular detail was not overlooked.  There's so much going on in this film that I'm sure many, including myself, will see it numerous times since I was so engrossed in it that it appeared to end too quickly.  Who knows, perhaps on DVD the deleted scenes and/or Director's Cut will make for even more an enjoyable experience.Well, enough of that.

829,mycranium,Let's send a robot back in time to prevent them from making this movie,2,5 July 2003,"There is absolutely nothing interesting in this movie. It is a lazily assembled amalgam of plot points from T2 and lines from The Terminator. It's as though they were too lazy to think up anything interesting and instead defaulted to trying to lamely remind you of bits you liked from the first two.Yeah, there's lots of destruction in this one, but who cares? The filmmakers completely fail to create any suspense. There's no character development, there's no plot, so there's nothing to invite the audience into giving a crap about any of the ""characters"". Claire Danes's character shows some promise at the beginning of the film, but her character quickly becomes a simp. Even Arnold gives lame line deliveries, as though he learned his lines right before they rolled camera. Not the good kind of Arnold lame that worked so perfectly in the first two movies, it's just authentically poor***possible mild spoiler ***
The police psychologist who talks to Claire Danes in the graveyard makes reference to having witnessed the Terminator assault on the police station in the original movie. But in that movie, he leaves just as Arnold enters the station. He's not even there when it all goes down! This blunder epitomizes the whole mess that T3 is - they were too lazy to get it right, they were more interested in coming up with a gag than doing anything dramatically interesting.By the way, in the ""flash forward"" scenes at the beginning of the movie I thought the guy was the doctor from Star Trek: Deep Space 9. But it's really Nick Stahl.BTW, Nick Stahl does look like he could be the child of Michael Biehn and Linda Hamilton. That's about the only detail of this move that looks like it had any thought given to it. The special effects look fine, but that only matters if they're used in service of a good story. But T3 has never been within two miles of a good story.Boring! See the first one again instead. I gave this one a 2 out of 10, and that was being generous.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

With that, there are some negatives:*SPOILERS WITHIN*The Bad:The terminator in this one is no match for the liquid terminator in Terminator 2 and that was kind of disappointing.Sarah Connor's mental doctor from Terminator 1 & 2 has a cameo in this film. Totally unnecessary and not funny.The T-101 is not very likeable in this movie, being a thug one minute  and a jokester the next.The meeting of John and his little friend Kate.  Totally unbelieveable. I think someone dropped the script here.A robot with laser guided missles cannot hit John and his little friend Kate.  Please!The Good:Great action scenes & special effects.Plot is actually believable here and advances the story a bit further which I didn't think was possible. We actually get to see into Skynet and see the start of Judgement Day.I think if they could have made a better terminator, this movie would be REALLY good, but it kind of takes a away from the movie a bit when I see something less then the T1000.Overall, 8/10.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
831,Unbreakable_MJ,Cool action but nothing else much,6,24 July 2003,"(SPOILERS inside)Tagline: If you're a true fan of Terminator & T2 then forget T3 (or whatever!). And if you actually think JP3 is better than JP & JP2 and MIB2 is better than MIB then you better go now to book your seat for T3!!First of all I'm a fan of Terminator the original and the first sequel. I find T2 is better than the original in many ways (although this is somehow a tough decision to make coz the original was great). T2 got great great action scenes, better story, great special effects by ILM, great acting by Linda Hamilton, cool ideas with a great story all the way, great directing, and great music. Enough? I dunno. I may add that I love it how T2 unfolds the story and all the scenes that make you scream COOL (like young John Corner riding his bike/ Sarah and her sporty acting/ T-800 looking for cloths with that song/etc..).So I went to T3 wishing to see something equal to that or maybe (just maybe) better. I knew I wouldn't buy anything if it's not James Cameron but I went along with the story anyway. Well, I tried alot to enjoy it but I couldn't. I laughed few times for Arni's lines. I actually started enjoying this movie in the last minute and couldn't understand how can it end like this, and now I hate it more because of this. The ending was very interesting: It's kinda promising ending (for at least another sequel) as hell as possible but you can use it as the true ending of the series. One thing to add is that I totally hated to see how Matrix Reloaded was affected by Minority Report, and now I see T3 getting affected by Matrix. Give me a break!Let's get to the details: Arnold seems to get better in the Terminator series. He started to look older though. I missed Sarah Corner and I especially missed Linda Hamilton. John Corner got some nice acting but he surely doesn't look like young John (from T2) to me. T-X was cool and it's good acting by Kristanna Loken, but I don't see her that much of sexy as they wanted us to think and as everyone is calling her that. Music? Well all I can say that it's nice, not much. Cinematography? Also nice, but not so great as Minority Report or Matrix Reloaded. Story? We all wanted to know more and more about the future and how everything happened and all, but I don't find T3 necessary to the series. I also hated how it ended, because we can end it just here (i.e. you know the war of the future and all) but it also opens the door if there ever gonna be T4 or more (i.e. we can actually see the war finally). Anything positive? Well yeah, the action scenes. They did a very good job on the action scenes. Cool action, they tried to make it as real as possible, and the special effects were great. If it was up to me, at least I'd shorten the introduction and add more to the story after the ending.Was this any real review? Nope. I just wrote my opinion.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

THANK GOD it turned out to be FANTASTIC...almost equal to a T3 by Cameron. Mostow defintely did make a few errors..like the use of comedy but oh god Terminator 3's action sequences and special effects make the other Terminator movies look obsolete. The story in on par with the second movie. Its a grand experinece..this third movie. You MUST watch it with your family/friends...For me this movie is a bonding of my friends cos the same people I watched the first film with, I watched the second one with and now the third one. Thank You Arnold Schwarzengger. Thank You Warner Bros. Thank You Mostow. You guys promised we would not be disappointed and you were right....TERMINATOR 3 HAS BECOME MY FAVOURITE SCI-FI MOVIE OF ALL TIME. CGI is used sparingly...70 % of the stunts were done by Schwarzenegger himself...hence him getting injured frequently. The actions and effects look real......BEACUSE THEY ARE REAL.

I don't really understand why it is rated R except for the strong violence. Arnold does a awesome job at being a bad ass and kicking some machine butt. In the beginning they try to set up the viewers with a little information about what Judgement day is and who John Conner is.  I would however recommend seeing one of the previous Terminators before seeing this film. It is action packed and very funny (in a good way).  Arnold has developed a witty sense of humor in this film and it lets the audience take a deep breath and relax from all the action.

I couldn't wait to see it.  In the end however, the trailer was better than the movie.  Sad... It happened in Star Wars Episode 2, and it happened in this.  The problem was the story. Very weak, not enough of it, and too many parts left unexplained.  This probably is the greatest ""B"" movie of all time, but it could never stand up to T2 or even T1 for that matter.  Why?  No Cameron.  It's just that simple. He created the idea, he knows it best.  Mostow did good with the action, but the story just wasn't up to expectations.

But the movie seemed too much of an attempt to cash in on the franchise rather than stay loyal to its roots.As a movie on its own - Good action flick, even if some of it was a bit silly (TX remote controlling cars) - 7/10As a Terminator movie - not as good as the previous 2, either in style or substance - 6/10",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
838,NetherV,Trash. An insult to James Cameron and an even bigger insult to the Terminator story.,1,5 October 2003,"First off, i generally give good reviews on lots of movies because i like to turn off from the real world and i realize that movies are for entertainment, but having said that i think Terminator 3 was the biggest load of trash i have ever seen. I LOVED the first two, the cast, the script, the storyline the effects blahblahblah everything was PERFECT, but this movie? Jesus no.Now the much debated storyline was of course a letdown, i still don't understand how something they prevented from being made (skynet) suddenly existed and how  did they manage to send 2 terminators back when there isn't even a  war, maybe i missed a large chunk of the movie or something, i think the idea is something to do with the war being inevitable even though theres no way all this shit could have happend in the first place, it just did, cool.as for the acting, the one liners were awful, the new enemy was a nice idea but the chick who played her role sucked :( And the whole tight leather outfit just made it even made it look even more pathetic. Thew new john conner wasn't john conner at all. I think the only good addition to the movie was claire danes, she played her part well, props to her.2 scenes which i hated were:1) bathroom fight with the 2 terminators - the tx just throws arnold across the room with no effort, why would she have a problem fighting him after? yes i know she did kick his ass but he shouldn't have been able to put up the slightest bit of a fight, they should have either kept it even or made it a complete blowout (one termiantor destroying the other) they shouldn't have done both it was just retarded.2) when arnold was approaching john outside the plane trying to resist hurting him - robots don't have emotions, IF A ROBOT IS PROGRAMMED TO DO SOMETHING IT DOES IT, NOT BECAUSE SOME GUY HE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW DOESN'T WANT HIM TO. And the fact that he slightly changes his voice when he says ""I AM A MACHINE"" made me sad. It seems as though nobody else noticed that but whatever.there was probably a million other things i could point out, but i can't be bothered, so anyway i think that this movie was a real let down, a below par trashy movie with women in leather cheesy one liners car chases and a typical ending for marketing, they'll obviously make another, lets hope james cameron answers our prayers and brings back the magic that was in the first two.0.5/10.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

The first two Terminator movies were great and definitely action classics, and the 3rd one really takes the ball and gives this series a slam dunk. The action is crisp and well filmed. The dialogue is sensible, both serious and half-mocking. Lastly, the storyline did not disappoint, as often is the case in sequels of this scale (ex. the Matrix movies). The casting in this movie at first threw me off, but eventually the new characters fit into the timeline. The female terminator is also another reason to check out T3 many times.

But after seeing the movie I felt betrayed, betrayed form the big Hollywood studio. And again, they showed only the best scenes from the movie. Ohh, no, not the best scenes, only the best key frames from action overloaded scenes.The runtime is too short, not even 2 hours of action was presented to the public. After the 2hour and 22 minutes of Terminator 2 I thought this third part, where the end of the world starts, will be as at least 2 hours long. Because of this lack of time the story is told a bit too fast. One action scene is right after the previous one, there is no time to think about the seen, no time to cross-link the first two parts with this third one. The talks of John Connor, where he explains where he was and what he was/is doing, well the story tellings, is simply flat, dry and monotone. Yeah, I could say it's boring. You get the info you have to know but it seems that there is no feeling behind that, it doesn't give the feeling that John is the"" man of the future, the one and only. . .The effects, some are realistic, some are not, even Terminator 2 from 1991 has more realistic effects than this one. I'm talking here especially about the cemetery scene where T-X flies on this gravestone. How the stone brakes and the dust this little accident makes is absolutely fake and this fake is visible, even from miles away. The car chaise, it's fine, but hell, did the this scene where all those buildings got demolished really cost 25$ millions.The cemetery scene with Kate, the doc and the police . . . well it's to boring. Kate being at the SWAT truck, talking to the doc, being very excites, under shock, talking nonsense, the doc offers her some chill pill ( something to calm her down ), Kate takes the pill, hold it in her hands, in the other hand some water and starts telling the doc what's up. Then she mentions the name John and some huge, and the doc asks who this John is. Kate says, John, John Connor, an old schoolmate"" and then the doc goes blank. You men John Connor, son of Sarah Connor""  Yes""  And this huge guy, and here comes the description of Arnie, calls himself a Terminator""  Yes, but how do you know that"" . . . and then you hear some explosions and machine guns firing. The doc turns around and sees the Terminator . . . doc shows his wondering face and says No, not again"", takes the pill away from Kate, drinks it . . . takes another pill(s) from drinks them and then runs away. . . Kate runs after him wondering how the doc knows this bullet eating giant and tells Kate the past contacts with this Terminatora and this is where Kate should realize that it's true what John was talking about . . . this small scene, told slowly, and wisely could have made the movie a bit longer and brought some break before the next big block of explosions and fight scenes To the ARMY, well the general and co at this Computer Defense center or whatever it is act like the generals from the movies Under Siege 1 and 2.The scene where T-man is reprogrammed to kill John and John is telling him not to do it, the inner fight that the Terminator has, is simply childish and very predictable. It is somehow the low, not Terminator like.It's also funny how two people in their mid 20's can escape from human killing machines, but the well trained, educated military people are killed within a few seconds. I thought in such high security facilities only the best of the best can be the guards. O.K., a lot of computer programmers, scientists and engineers are working there, but it's simply stupid that they get killed.It seems like Jonathan Mostow used the analogy, the time-line, the art of T2 and tried to copy it to the new is story. Tried to make the same things but really failed.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
843,DD_Shadow,The Terminator equivalent of Jurassic Park 3,7,31 October 2005,"When Terminator 3 finally launched in theaters, my friend and I were beside ourselves with excitement. After all we were and still are two of the biggest Terminator fans on the planet. T1 and T2 were superb! Awesome story, awesome action, awesome visual effects. Too bad T3 ended up mediocre... While boasting the most impressive visual and CGi effects of the trilogy (this is evident by the increased number of T800 Terminators on screen at once at the beginning of the movie)the script was basically just the T2 script taken and changed here and there. Its the year 2004 and John Connor, leader of the human resistance is now in his 20s. Even after the destruction of the Cyberdyne computers in T2, John still feels unsafe and so is a simple bum who lives off the grid so no computer network can locate him. As with T1 and 2 a Terminator (TX) arrives from the future to hunt down the human saviour and terminate him. Thankfully Big Arnie is back, and once again steps up to the plate as Johns protector. The movie is basically then just degraded into a bunch of highly explosive and action packed sequences, eventually leading to the flicks climax when Skynet becomes self aware and begins taking over. If i haven't already said so, T3, Like Jurassic Park 3, disappointed me a hell of a lot. While boasting the most impressive spesh fx of their respective trilogies, the overall qualities of the films is subpar, and T3 is degraded into a simple beer-and-pretzels action romp. Average at best, though still worth a rental.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
844,demonx70,Far from its predecessor but not that bad,7,19 May 2017,"Terminator 2 is one of my favorite films of all time. Perfectly cast and paced. Great balance of action and humor. This is not that. I recently went back to this for the first time in maybe a decade. I saw it in the cinema when it first came out and thought it was pretty mediocre. On viewing it again, I can say it is alright. It doesn't really feel like a terminator film but there are some good action set pieces and nice twists that make up for it.If you are are willing to look past its flaws (and there are two pretty cringy/bad moments) it is not as bad as you might have heard.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
845,Saxcat,An incredible addition to the Terminator legacy...,10,3 July 2003,"It is plain and simple. Terminator 3 far exceeded my expectations...Looking at the figures, the film was not directed by James Cameron, not composed by Brad Fidel, had hardly any of the same actors in it and yet...was amazing.This film contained some of the greatest action sequences seen on screen, was well acted, and had enough plot twists to keep up both the physical and psychological attraction of the viewer.Perhaps the greatest attribute of Terminator 3, is that the film pays tribute and recognizes its roots. Many of the situations in this film are similar, yet do not simply repeat the formula of the first two films. Yet, at the same time the plot recognizes and uses all of the elements of the Terminator story to create a realistic, exciting, and ultimately depressing film which will be sure to stand the test of time for many years to come.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
846,jimbuckusa,Check your brains and your eardrums at the door.,1,7 July 2003,"T3 is a sad comment on the state of movies today.  I learned from the manager of the theater that I attended that the volume control in the auditorium is dictated by the studio.  If you walked out of T3 with your ears ringing and your senses scrambled, and, perhaps, even noticed the befuddled state of your brain and the distinctive wobble of your walk then there may be hope for you.  The first 30 minutes of this film had nothing but violence and noise, and the most ridiculous unnecessary chase scene ever filmed. I recall a friend's comment after listening to a particularly poor rock group, ""If you can't play good, play loud."" Terminator 3 played loud. You say you thought it was exciting, thrilling, mind-blowing, and the last word in action movies!? I say, B.S.! This film was garbage.  To compare it with either of the previous Terminator movies says much about the rapidly dimming intelligence of today's movie audience. James Cameron is certainly laughing at this atrocity. If you liked this movie, you like leaf-blowers.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

And I doubt you'll be too surprised to hear that there's virtually nothing else to the film.My favourite bit was the word ""Terminatrix"" :-)I think I'll wait for the DVD rental copy of T4, it won't be worth the trip to the theatre.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
848,PeteWade,Unbelievable!,9,7 July 2003,"I, like many, thought T3 would be a let down after the cutting edge computer wizardry of T2 blew us away in the early '90's. Not expecting much, thinking Jonathan Mostow would not be able to duplicate the magic that James Cameron created in the first two-thirds of this trilogy, I was absolutely amazed at what I saw.The opening chase sequence is the best I've ever seen, better than the infamous car chases in ""Ronin"", ""Striking Distance"", ""Mission: Impossible II"", and ""Gone in Sixty Seconds"". Being a sound editor in the business affords me some expertise, and the audio in this movie was unbelievable! And having an incredibly hot Kristanna Sommer Loken as the sexy yet unrelenting killing machine was a lot more enjoyable than watching old Robert Patrick, the T-1000 from T2.For the quintessential action movie fan, it may not be ""Die Hard"", but you'll find this movie surprisingly among the 20 best pure action movies ever made; a real gem for the summer of 2003. That's despite the weak ending and poorly made CG helicopters.If you favor plotlines and emotions over kick-butt, non-stop action, just stay at home. I like plot too, but every once in a while, I just want to be entertained and overwhelmed by the sheer power of a movie.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
849,scurvyfreedman,They needed more flesh for the hyperalloy combat chassis,7,6 July 2003,"Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is a storyboard, not much more.  They sketched out the basic plot and brought in the artist for concepts.  The characters were drawn with colored pencils with explosions in the background with great detail.  That all translated directly to the screen.  Each character had the right look.  All of the action sequences were shot from the right angles.  But, they forgot to add the dialog that was necessary to take this from a long action sequence to a good movie.What's important about the first two Terminator movies is the development of the killing machine sent back in time, the panic and fear of the one or several characters who know what the Terminator can do and the denial of those who won't believe them, and the apparent indestructability of the Terminator, until a novel strategy is employed.  This movie neglects the first two and makes it just a chase to the grand finale.  But, since you don't know the characters, except what you already know about John Connor there's more than one thing missing.***********************SPOILERS*************************The movie starts and the T-X begins assassinating young people throughout Los Angeles.  How much extra time would it have taken to add some police investigation of the serial murders.  What do these teenagers have in common?  Maybe something that reveals all of the teenagers will be outside the Los Angeles area within the next 48 hours.  That's integral to the long-term storyline, but it's neglected.Then the T-X just shows up at the Animal Clinic where Brewster is at 5:30am. Why wouldn't she go to Brewster's home rather than the Clinic. Unexplained.  Obviously Brewster told T-101 that she would be there that night with Connor, so that makes sense.There isn't the build up, like in Terminator or T-2, where the main characters are hunted by their would be mechanical assassin, and it's really necessary, not just to build tension, but also to build the character of the Terminator.  In this case, there is no personality nor inevitability of the T-X.The secondary characters are also neglected.  General Brewster is hardly explained.  He doesn't want to give up control to Skynet, but why not.  Give us a little more about him, his program, his staff.  Let us connect to him a bit.  Why does he do what he does at the end?Introducing Dr. Peter Silberman back into the story was a fun idea, but they really gave him nothing to work with.  That could have been much more useful.In T-2 the Terminator is used well to advance the future plot and to give background to the audience through narrative about Judgment Day.  Since Brewster is a totally unknowledgeable character, such narrative would help here too, but it's only done in scant detail.  Stretching things out over several days, instead of packing everything into one could have given this freedom to advance the plot.  Adding another important character could have done this as well.  In T-2, the T-101 explains Judgment Day to Sarah Connor and Myles Bennett Dyson.  It adds weight when he tells the story twice, but differently.  The longer time period could have given more chance to advance the story that way, and it would have allowed the background police investigation I proposed above.The definition of Skynet at the end doesn't make much sense at all.  Perhaps the supercomputer becomes aware and takes control of all networked systems, but for all computers to be part of it, because of software, is foolish.Finally, ""I can't help you with what you must soon face, except to tell you that the future is not set... there is no such thing as Fate, but what we make for ourselves by our own will.""  I guess the free will idea Cameron created in the first two Terminator films was thrown out with the bath water.Since the film was only about 90 minutes, these things could have added flesh to the hyperalloy combat chassis without over burdening the microprocessor.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

851,FlyByNight32,Too many plot flaws to be good.,3,19 December 2005,"The first Terminator had good special effects and a good plot. The second had really good effects and a decent plot. The third had great effects and a weak plot.The explanation at the end is what really bugs me about this movie. They claim that they couldn't shut down the machine brain because it wasn't just in one place, but existed spread out in servers all across the country.The thing is, that's stupid. If that were the case, then the artificial intelligence would have died shortly after it launched the nukes, because all those servers would have been destroyed. It would have been like taking a large knife, trying to remove your nose by jamming the blade straight into your skull. Sure, you'd get rid of the nose, but it wouldn't help your brain much.Also, the idea that the Terminator had killed Conner in the future and was sent by his wife is flawed. Way back in the first film, we learn from Kyle that the human revolt against the machines had been successful, they had already won. Sending the Terminators back was a last-ditch effort to prevent that defeat. Therefore, there should have been no Terminator sent after John years after the machines were defeated.Also, in the first movie Kyle says that the time displacement equipment was to be destroyed after he went thru. From T2, it's obvious that they sent the second one after he went. However, it's hardly likely that they would change their minds and not destroy the time machine after that; they already knew what a problem they were facing with just the two Terminators that had gone through already.Also, if John's learning that he's going to get killed by a Terminator in the future (which he was told), then he should be able to avoid it.Not to mention that a nuclear-safe bunker set up for VIPs wouldn't have obsolete computers, radios and other equipment; restocking and updating it would be a periodic activity.There are so many basic plot flaws in this movie, the only value it has left is the special effects.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

Hollywood tried to cash in one of the greatest film franchises of all time, but had to do so without James Cameron, Linda Hamilton or Ed Furlong. James Cameron walked away from this project in disgust over the horrible screenplay they wrote.This film should have been based off the canon sequel, T2:Infiltrator by S.M. Stirling. It is one of the best science fiction novels I've ever read, so well written with plenty of character development, action, and plot twists. S.M. Stirling wrote this novel based on the Terminator world created by James Cameron and William Wisher, and Mr. Cameron originally considered basing the screenplay for T3 off of this book, but the studio ruled against it, so he walked away from the project.You be the judge.. -SPOILER ALERT-A few years after T2, John and Sarah Connor are living in Paraguay in solitude. Their new neighbor just happens to be a retired intelligence agent who, years later, would be captured and killed by Skynet, his face used as the model for all T-101s.Meanwhile, Skynet (yes, Cyberdyne had their work backed up at another facility) sends its greatest weapon back in time. An actual human/cyborg hybrid. She is physically human with cybernetic nano-implants and a neural net processor implanted in her brain at birth. She is a human Terminator who can think and feel as people do, but with superhuman strength and reflexes.The Infiltrator gets a job at Cyberdyne as their head of security, builds a half dozen Terminators and sends them to kill John and Sarah Connor and to insure Skynet's future..",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
856,AngryVengefulMonkey,BIG Let Down,3,28 August 2003,"Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is one of the most disappointing films I've ever seen. How dare they destroy what had gone before.First of all it seems to have turned into an action-comedy film, at times the humour is almost slapstick, this means that the suspense of the first two has been completely removed. Our new female terminator friend was lacking. I can't quite put my finger on it but I didn't 'fear' this one. What about the action? We were promised spectacular action scenes and I suppose some were quite good but when you're not enjoying a film they tend to get a bit boring after a while.If I was forced to say something nice about this film then I would have to say that the ending is good (and not just because the film was now over) but mainly because it was unexpected. I am, however, a little concerned about the prospect of a sequel. Even though I suppose it would HAVE to be better than this. Now that I've got all that off my chest I'm going to go and sit down and watch the first two installments and try to forget that Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines ever happened.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

Naturally, before the movie I read different reviews, many which criticized the action sequences in the movie. They compared them to The Matrix and said that the technology did not match up.  Well, I would think that anyone that has seen Terminator would know that it is not about ""Matrix style"" fighting.  I thought the action sequences were great and the interaction between the old and new characters was fantastic.  I don't know how many times I've sat through a movie, and whether I enjoy it or not, sit there and think...how mich time is left??  At the end of Terminator (which is 110 minutes long), I was couldn't believe I had just spent 2 hours in a theatre.  It completly flew by.

858,wimjim,Parodies with Alien Series.,6,7 August 2003,"The Terminator series somehow parodies the Alien series. The first two films were amazing pieces of story telling, at different levels. The first one being dark, and edgy. The second to be more mainstream and action orientated. This accounts to both series and the fact that James Cameron is linked as director between these series, is strange also.The difference now is that Alien has made up to 4 sequels, and more coming (so I've heard). Terminator stopped at number 2, till now. Both series had two great starters, and Terminator supposedly stopped at 2, it still had potential to carry on. Hollywood being Hollywood, they decided to do another one. As James Cameron directed both, it would be logical to let him carry the helm for the third time, but he declined. If he declined so would many actors to follow, Linda Hamilton, Edward Furlong, (Though I think they didn't pick him, due to drug offences). Though Arnold Swarzeneggar had to accept for the movie to go ahead, as he was the major star in the last two. Much like Sigourney Weaver in the Alien Series. He had to accept as he hasn't had a hit for a long, long time.Like the alien movies, the standards set were very high, so the next sequel will be hard to impress. For me the third Alien movie, was different and wasn't bad, but compared to the last two it was poor. This is what I feel about Terminator 3: The Rise of the Machines as well.The problem with sequels, is that the audience knows the characters now, therefore people make their own judgement on how that character would react. Which may differ to the director. The story: There is now a new model terminator, a T-X (Kristanna Loken)a more advance terminator than T-1000. Who has been sent back in time out to kill John Connor (Nick Stahl), who is now a lot older from the last outing. T-800 (Arny of course) is also sent back to protect him. Basically the same plot from T2, but there is a difference, T-X is a female and a lot more advanced. My opinion of Skynet is that it would be illogical for them to make a terminator that is female, pretty and I thought they would explain the reason, but do not. For me Kristanna Loken plays a good killer, but it just seemed that Hollywood realised that the market in movies, are stronger women. Which has already been experienced in T2. It just doesn't work for me, though I'm not trying to be sexist.I feel John Connor seemed a little weak for someone, who will lead the last human rebellion to victory. Even Claire Danes character was stronger than him.The overall story destroys the message that was given in T2. Well it is still entertaining, certainly a lot more funnier than the last one. Can't believe it recieved a 12A rating in the UK, so I must insist you don't bring in children to watch this, as there is a certain scene that is quite disturbing.C-",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

It was James Cameron wrote and directed both the first and second Terminator movies. Both movies were classics.The main problem is that Jonathan Mostow, director of this movie, fails miserably to imitate the genius style of James Cameron. T3 is littered with bad music, cliché dialog, and terrible editing and cinematography. Mostow is about as mediocre of a director as one can be.Honestly, this movie should have never been made. The Terminator series has been spoiled. The only positive thing I can say about this movie is that the special effects were good and that Kristanna Loken looked absolutely gorgeous.But that's the problem. The main focus of attention was the special effects and Loken.

863,fritchie83,Jonathan Mostow is a genius!,10,3 August 2003,"This is, without a doubt, definitely the best and biggest film of 2003. All of those people who doubted Jonathan Mostow should be ashamed of themselves, I know I am.  This film completely blew me away.Arnold plays the part as T - 100 even better than he did the last two times It seem like there is no stopping this man - he just keeps on getting better and better!Nick Stahl portrays John Connor, in the way that you would imagine a young man with so much stress on his shoulders to be like.  Jonathan Mostow has to be applauded for bringing this talented young actor into such a big movie for all us young ladies to dribble over.Kristanna Loken, who is a little scary I must admit, is amazing at playing a new, more advanced, terminator model, named TX, who is trying to kill John Connor.  She only has a few lines in the film (like six), but I feel that this scares the audience even more as she has to act simply through her facial expressions.  Again, Jonathan Mostow has done a great job in casting when he introduced us to this former model.All I have left to say is that the special effects in T3 are the way that special effects should be, they are not fake like in The Lord Of The Rings or Harry Potter.  Instead they are simply mind blowing, as well as the stunts.So if you are going to see a film this year, I would strongly recommend Terminator 3: Rise Of The Machines.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
864,Apple Scruff,Exceeded all my expectations,7,13 July 2003,"What can I say, but I really enjoyed Terminator 3.  The key, I believe, was to go in expecting to be let down.  2003 has been and will continue to be a sequel-happy year, filled with instantly forgettable rehashes of successful films in order to see if lightning would strike twice, or thrice, or who knows how many more times.  Since the first two Terminator films were so incredibly good and T2 ended on such a fantastic note, I didn't think another good entry into the Terminator franchise was possible, especially since a) Arnold isn't young anymore, b) Linda Hamilton was not involved, and c) neither was Jim Cameron. I was expecting a sub-par action flick with mediocre special effects and painfully shallow performances all around. While the amazing Linda Hamilton's presence was sorely missed, as was the direction (not necessarily the dialogue) of James Cameron, T3 really delivered! It was a great deal of fun and excitement, exactly what a summer moviegoer should want to see during a season known for idiot movies.
I am very hard to please in the summertime since SO much trash comes out and most so-called films released between June and August insult my intelligence beyond forgiveness. While not as fresh, intriguing, and thought-provoking as the first two, Terminator 3 actually, surprisingly, had somewhat of a brain! The story was well-conceived, the special effects were out of the park incredible (given the budget, they'd BETTER have been!), Arnold was in great shape, and most strikingly, the performances were very strong indeed!
While Arnold Schwarzenegger's speaking performance was limited mostly to expository dialogue, short commands or replies (""Negative"", ""Get down!"", ""Take the wheel""), he gave a delightfully campy, tongue-in-cheek portrayal of the part tailor-made for him. His deadpan quips were in the ""lame and predictable, but can't help laughing and smiling"" category.  As for the stunts and his fights with the new T-X supervillain, or ""Terminatrix"" (played adequately enough by stone-faced stunner Kristanna Loken), they were outstanding. At times, the physical confrontations between the two make the classic fights between Arnold's T-101 and Robert Patrick's T-1000 in T2 look like a schoolyard spat. I kept seeing dollar signs popping up with all the cars, buildings, etc. that were destroyed.Perhaps the most inspired casting, however, were Claire Danes as Kate Brewster and Nick Stahl as John Connor.  I NEVER would have expected Claire Danes to fit well into a Terminator movie, but she was a gem! First of all, she's looking great these days. She has such attractive features, but in more of a classical way.  Whereas Loken's looks make guys simply say, ""She's hot!"", Danes has more of the look of a girl that a respectable man would want to introduce to his family.  She played her part excellently and remembered to have a good time doing it, as one can see while watching her.
Nick Stahl was perfectly cast as reluctant hero John Connor.  He had a look in his eyes of a man with a haunting past (and future) as the role requires. There was a wonderful sense of urgency and despair in his voice that told me that he understood the part completely. His character's frustration came through perfectly and I know purists say that Eddie Furlong should've played him, but I disagree. Furlong was okay as young John, but nowadays he just doesn't have a certain look that Conner should have (no offense to Eddie. loved him in American History X).  Stahl has such a strong dark side, it's a shame the part of Anakin Skywalker in Star Wars Episodes II and III didn't go to him, as he would have probably done very well.Overall, I was pleasantly surprised.  T3 packed a nice summer popcorn movie punch and a very clever ending.  Considering the expectations and the dynamite of potentially alienating diehard Terminator fans, director Mostow, whose exciting 1997 B-movie Breakdown showed a great deal of promise, has earned his wings in the annals of action moviemaking.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

I have no clue, I was expecting more and didn't get it.

867,lemberg,Thanks for very solid movie,9,6 July 2003,"I read some imdb reviews before going to see the movie and I didn't have much of expectation. It turned to be false alarm. It is great movie - it follows traditions of first and second Terminator. It has very solid script and I counted only two moments, which might be edited out.Visual effects are very good, but they are not extraordinary. Anyway it is better this way, that vice versa in Star Wars Episode II.There are several funny episodes, which does not spoil movie at all. One can laugh or not, because movie does not depend on them at all. It is like T1 episode in hotel, when Arny selects ""@##! off"" from menu. That one also was decoration, but very good one.POSSIBLE SPOILERS HERE*****************************************I liked ending, it is first not happy end for Terminator movies. It should have been that way. Machines are too powerful even now and once they got loose, nothing will stop them. It is better not to start such things. Also, movie shows that machine can be really human, but not by behavior as in second terminator. It shows that they can make choices, which are against their orders and which are right in human sense. Of course, it is not very sophisticated in the scene, where Arny breaks the car, instead of killing John. BTW, Arny is really great: just recall scenes with sunglasses.There is couple of logical and technical mistakes in the movie, which are not very critical. At first, how Skynet can start sending virus, if it was only in air force laboratory and not connected anywhere else? Also it was not even self-aware, so it should not have had evil intentions at that point. At second, phrase ""our firewalls are holding virus"" sounds great, but I hope, it is not a case and military networks are completely physically separated from Internet. At third, it is just usual stuff in action movies, Terminatrix was able run with speed of a car, but it cannot overtake Kate and John in the tunnel on the airbase.And last, I like Claire Danes and Arnold Schwarzenegger (in case if I meet him someday :), but rest of the actors play looks a bit forced.*****************************************I gave 9 of 10.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
868,KBean5588,"Awesome Action & Villian, Great Ending, Good Story",9,17 July 2003,"Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines, is in my opinion, very well done. It combines the most intense action sequences that I have ever seen along with some good characters and a pretty well thought out plot. The acting: Overall, I would have to say the acting was good. Nothing great, but good for an Action/Sci-Fi movie. Nick Stahl's performance was fine, nothing to over-criticize. His performance as the older, 20-something year old John Conner has made some fans of the series a little angry at how different his John Conner is compared to T2's Edward Furlong's. First of all, I think they are both good actors and I probably would have rather seen Edward Furlong reprise his role as John Conner in the third film, but Nick Stahl did good. I also tend to agree to some extent the characteristic differences between the two Conners, but the only explanation that I can give is that going through a life-changing experience like Furlong's bad-ass Conner did in T2, can change your personality throughout your life, especially when you know the world is in your hands. So maybe the new Director, who also did a awesome job to fill in for Cameron, wanted the new Conner to act the way he did. Claire Danes was very good in my opinion as Kate Brewster, her first action role. Some critics and fans panned her performance and her character because they said she was just the girl who `screamed at everything.' Well, maybe she did, but at least she brought some of the only emotion from all the actors in the film. Arnold is Arnold. He will never be able to get away from Terminator, no matter what film he is cast in. It will always be compared to Terminator. He is in excellent physical condition for his age (56?). Kristanna Loken was exceptionally villainous as the new T-X evil Terminator, and extremely hot. Many people don't realize how hard it can be to be kicked, punched, and hit over the head (even if it isn't hard) and not flinch. Her face stayed emotionless and calm, exactly how a terminator should act. A few times she smiled, but that only added to her evilness. Although her character isn't nearly as terrifying as Robert Patrick's T-1000 in T2, she definitely added some presence onscreen. The Story: Overall, the story was good. Some stuff evolved from the previous two films and some other things contradicted them. I would definitely have liked it to be a little longer. But I have to say that I liked the fact that Jonathan Mostow took a different approach than Cameron by going straight to the action, and staying there the entire time. That is much different than Cameron's Action, Drama, Action direction from T2. Mostow had massive shoes to fill, and he filled them quite well. I loved the action scenes, because even though a large amount of special effects were used, they weren't the main object in each scene, like in Attack of the Clones. Many people are calling the effects mediocre, and nothing compared to T2's groundbreaking, Oscar-winning effects. Well, he knew he wouldn't live up to the effects, because basically, there was no more ground to break in the Visual Effects world, so he decided to take a different approach to the action scenes. And it paid off, for me at least. There is one scene that is possibly one of the best action-chase scenes that I have ever seen in a movie. All I will say is that it involves a massive crane truck, a Toyota Tundra, a motorcycle, a fire truck, and many `undriven' police cars. Awesome scene, and one of the best parts of the movie. All in all, great movie and if you're a fan of action or Sci-fi, you'll like it. Just don't think too much of it like a die-hard Terminator fan, or else you'll get to confused. ***1/2/****",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
869,ThugMstr4u,Very good,10,4 July 2003,This was one heck of a movie. The Effects are good. The Acting is Superb Especially by Kristina Lokken and Arnold. Nick Stahl was also very good as John Connor. Everything about this movie is excellent. It was well worth a ten year wait. Although I don't think it is better than Terminator 2 Judgement Day. I think it is a tie between them. I was Shocked to see that Judgement Day still happened. I guess Skynet did win.I wonder if they will make a Terminator 4. Overall excellent movie ****,Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
870,pottugrapher,unworthy successor,7,12 July 2003,"first off, i'd like to say that as purely an action sci-fi flick, t3 has enough firepower to blow u away. explosions aplenty, and a t-x babe to ogle at. wat more could a guy ask for? plenty more in fact. cut to the chase. t3 lacks the depth of the previous 2 terminator movies. its purely action and just a lil develpoment of storyline to set up for t4. the feelings n emotion werent half as strong as compared to t1 n 2, and i feel they really focused too much on action, throwing plot out the window. it is that mix of emotion and suspense that really made the first 2 classics, and it is sadly lacking here. the t-x wasnt as remotely scary as the t-1000 played by Robert Patrick and i felt that t3 really could have done without those awful one-liners. the mood of t3 just doesnt provide for it, and putting the funny moments just felt awkard. all in all, im really surprised they took 12 yrs to come up with nothing more than a summer popcorn flick. hope t4's good enuff to let me forget this.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

The Original Terminator and T-1000 only killed when they had to or just when they were annoyed by someone. The TX kills EVERYTHING that she sees.Arnold is back and I hope hes ready for part 4. The way they would talk about T2 was great: ""Oh man....so I have to teach you everything again?""The entire theatre was a riot as everyone laughed so hard at Arnold's expertly executed humor. There are many scenes that are touching and powerfully delivered (when Arnie goes beserk) The ending was the best of the series as you were literally either screaming or just at the edge of your seat. I cant wait for T-4. Looks like the series is finally going to be in the future.(Also special props to Claire Daines and Staln for doing such a great job and proving the world wrong) And special props for T-X for being so hot.***********SPOILER***************Best line of movieArnie: ""Are you hurt?""

Boy.... was I ever wrong.... Don't worry folks, this is not just an action-banger like Matrix Reloaded. The audience gets a real good feel of the movie. The action scenes are very realistic, the director did a great job stepping into Cameron's shoes, the acting was really good, and above all..... it was not just another Hollywood bang it all up and walk away smoothly movie! The ending is perfect, no, literally it is PERFECT!! Some of the regrets are however: 1) Should have been a little longer man... it's only 1hr 49 mins.. 2) There should have been better background music , 3) Cameron's touch was definitely missing as T-X was not as menacing as Robert Patrick in T2. But hey, Jonathan Mostow did a wonderful job... And Arnold of course... Man, this guy's amazing.. Even at 55, he's still got it in him to lead the way for all action stars out there.. I watched it a second time already, and it seemed soooooo much better the second time. I loved it. Gets a 10/10 from me. Go and enjoy this movie. Don't miss it.

All I wanted was a good continuation of the story line mixed with some decent action. And that's exactly what I got. (Which is more than I can say for the Matrix 2 and 3)I think the best change from the last movie to this one is the recasting of John Connor. Nick Stahl did a pretty good job, and it was a hell of a lot better than Edward ""I'm Strung Out On Everything In Existence"" Furlong could ever do. Claire Danes was good, even with her Laura Bush haircut and Arnold was...well, Arnold.A few minor plot holes aside, I recommend watching this if you are a fan of the first two.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

This movie has it all, smart acting, food for the eyes and the ultimate ending. This has truly been one of the greatest years for movies I have witnessed to date. Arnie comes back and does exactly what he should have, a good rock steady performance. Everything about this movie is spot on, from the chase scenes to the humour. When I go to see a movie in the cinema I want to be entertained from start to finish, so that I can forget about the fact that my leg is cramping up because my seat is poor quality. This does it for me. I'm one of the biggest fans going when it comes to the Terminator series, yet I have not been prejudiced against this movie from the beginning just because James 'Titanic' Cameron wasn't involved. Its his loss not being a part of the 3rd and hopefully 4th movie in some small way. Why do people frown at the thought of a sequel coming out. It extends the emotion that was had in the first movie, which if only small can't be a bad thing. After all it costs about £4 to go see the damn movie, how can that not be money well spent when the package is this good.

I thought this movie was superb!  Arnold has some really funny scenes and Nick Stahl is wonderful!  Soooo much better than Edward Furlong. I thought Edward did a terrible job in T2 - Nick portrays the character awesomely - Danes does a good job also.  I do miss Linda Hamilton and Michael Biehn though.  The stunts and effects are astounding - I actually saw stunts performed that haven't been done before in all other general action flicks.  Overall - I was very impressed with the cast - I thought it would have been more effective to have used Vin Diesal or someone else as the other terminater besides the female.  She just didn't scare me like Robert Patrick in T2.  Definately worth it and can't wait for a T4 - Arnold was born for this character!",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
882,baddog66,"Not bad, but not great",6,21 July 2003,"Contains spoilers Okay, here's another chance where hollywood could have pulled off a great movie but proves once again that a quality sequel is second to a just producing a sequel.T3 has just been reduced to the status of just another sequel.  James Cameron's T2, like Titanic, Aliens and the Abyss are brilliant in their construction.  Sure there are minor plot questions but nothing major. Character development and the story was as important as the special effects. Cameron poured quality into T2.  It is the quality of a sequel that will stand the test of time.  Like Aliens stands the test of time, but Aliens 3 and 4 do not.So what are my complaints?  1) the comedy in the film was wrong and out of place, 2) the film didn't make me really care about the story, and 3) the plot sucks.Here is just a few instances of crappy plot that should have been fixed before shooting began.1)  How did a guy who looks like a hobo loaded with guns and explosives, a weightlifter clad in leather bikerwear and a normal civilian-looking girl get into the middle of command and control in a high security military installation.   And they can walk around freely.  Even though the girl is the general's daughter, they would never get past the first gate. Somebody would at least question the guy with explosives.2) I won't give away the movie here but the TX has a list of people it needs to ""terminate"".  #1 on the list would be John Conner, #2 and 3 on the list would be the girl and her General father.  When the TX first arrives here, why does she go looking for the guy working at the fast food place?  Then she she goes to where the girl works at 4 o'clock in the morning.  I thought these things are supposed to be smart.  Somebody on this site already brought up this point, but shouldn't she have went to the girl's apartment at 4am because humans are normally sleeping at that time?  Oh yeah, and for some reason Arnold went to the girls work at 4 am too.  It must be a popular hang out for terminators.3) The TX somehow knew the John Conner was going to the fallout shelter in the desert.  I won't give away anything here either, but I think this is kinda messed up.  There way no way for the TX to know this.  Especially since Arnold earlier said they needed to hide in Mexico. So... the TX should have assumed that as well.  The terminators are supposed to be smart not all-knowing.4) The whole Cyber-dyne/Skynet thing that made sense in the second film gets confused in this one.  If you pick up a book and read the first two chapters and the entire story is built around certain facts that are butchered in chapter 3, you are probably going to throw the book right out the window. Maybe I'm just confused on this one but according to T2, without Cyber-dyne, Skynet and the Terminators won't exist.  Cyber-dyne was eradicated in chapter 2.  Why couldn't we have come up with some alternate explanation for a ""Judgement Day"" sequel without ruining this ""book"" in chapter 3.
There was many more instances but these just flat out bugged me during the film.  Can't someone during pre-production screen these things and say something like, ""hey, this don't make sense"" or ""this story blows""?This would have been a better film if they would have 3 of the Robert Patrick T-1000's and have them sent back for a man hunt to eliminate a list of people. The TX was kinda cool, but the T-1000 was a better advisary.  To have the one TX running all over the place and mangling the plot with it, was stupid.More importantly, they also needed to explain WHY does the terminator technology still exists today and WHY skynet still exists and WHY that virus was introduced to the machines of the world. And who created and introduced that virus???  I don't know either and I've seen the film.I think this all boils down to the director who is the man in charge here. Basically it is because Jonathan Mostow was not a great choice for director. He hasn't done anything amazing yet.  His only real success so far was U-571, and that was not a great movie either.A director needs to be able to supply us the viewers with more than flashes, kicks, and explosions.  We want value for our money.  We want a story that makes sense.  And we want every chapter (sequel) to fill in more of the pieces of the puzzle for us.  We want to love a movie because it has meaning.  If it has meaning and value we will go see it more than once, even at $8.50.  We will want to own it on DVD.  We will want to own the director's cut with added footage in to give us more of what we already love.  That's what Hollywood needs to understand and then maybe we won't get crap sequels anymore.Not everything has to be flawless in a movie or its' sequels but we want an offering that does not insult our intelligence like this movie does.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

I became an instant fan of them immediatly, but when i heard there was a sequel coming out, i got really excited.  But then i got some terrible news.  James Cameron, the director of the first two Terminator movies was not going to direct this one, and the actress who was playing Sarah Connor said she didn't want to return.  I have to admit also that when the first T3 trailer came out i booed it(as did many other people who were there that night.)  But soon the trailers kept looking better and better and i thought maybe it wasn't going to be so bad.  Still though i kept low expectations(which i think every fan should have of cult movies). I saw it today, and it keeps getting better and better to me as time goes on. Although it repeats many things from the first two, i think it was well done, especially in SFX dept. Any fan of terminator should see this, and although it's not as good as the first two, it's worthy of the terminator name.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

First I read the announcement of the T3 with a female terminator around 10 years ago in a magazine, so I was looking forward to it long time. Today I watched it (my first Terminator movie in cinema), and I declare all the staff made a good work. Ms. Kristanna Loken was so the good choice!",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
885,The_1,Enjoyable in its own right...,8,28 July 2003,"T3 is a great movie. In a way, it's everything a great action movie should be and nothing it shouldn't. It contains some good-ol' fashioned action movie elements like car-chases, explosions, combat scenes, etc. It also contains the mandatory odd humour and romantic undertones. However, just like with any action movie, there are flaws, and since this is a sequel to one of the best action movies of all time, these flaws are perhaps more serious.In all honesty, a third Terminator film should never have been made, even IF James Cameron came on board again. T2 pretty much wrapped things up as Cyberdyne was destroyed, thus eliminating any chance of a machine-dominated future. The plot of T3 makes T2's plot null-and-void. One cannot help but feel that the entire integrity of T2 is destroyed: it's like the events that happened in T2 were meaningless. T3 was obviously created to needlessly cash-in on the Terminator franchise.However, if you somehow succeed in forgetting everything you knew about the first two films, T3 wouldn't seem all that bad. As mentioned, it was made well and you do get a sense of closure at the end of the film, which is increasingly rare to find in films these days. While the script is somewhat inconsistent and the dialogue crude, the movie as a whole stands up pretty well, thanks to some great action sequences. Personally, I didn't like the idea that T-800 wasn't the same protector as the one we learned to love in T2. His character fails to develop as he did in T2. In fact, Arnold's character seems to combine the best parts of the T-800 from the first film and the second one. Nick Stahl does a great job portraying John Connor, albeit giving him a new sense of values. I would've preferred to see Edward Furlong reprising his character as there was clearly a chemistry between him and Schwarzenegger in the second film. Stahl definitely has the qualities of a man leading others against the machines, but I got used to Furlong playing bratty child-like Connor.Apart from these flaws, the movie is otherwise very enjoyable to watch. I think director Mostow did a fine job in creating an entertaining movie, especially keeping in mind what he was following up to...",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
886,cantthinkofanid,it all depends on what you were expecting,7,3 July 2003,"ok, so we all love T2, and the original was ok, but I think there is something to be said for the new installment of the terminator series.
I'm going to start off by saying that I Hate CG, but the makers of T3 used it very well in most scenes, some times i even wondered if i was watching something real, or a cartoon, and other times it was obvious, but that's not the point. it's still 12 times better than a certain star wars that will remain nameless.the only thing i'm wondering about is why they couldn't get Edward Furlong to play the older John Conner. Nick Stahl (who inherited the role) does a close to awful job as the main character, next to Claire Daines, who actually does pretty well with the part she's given. Arnold returns as the Title role; he's been doing the part for so long that i think he's finally got it down.like 7 out of 9 movies playing at the theatre right now, T3 is a sequel or a remake. one of the big problems with making a sequel or a remake is that the film makers feel as though they must pay homage to the orginals, with things that turn out no better that a pun. i feel that the movie was a little caught up in it's sequel-ness; with lines like ""she'll be back."" and other scenes that were remeniscent of the first 2.I give it a C- maybe a C. for an action movie, it was ok. for a sequel it was good. acting was pretty bad, but i can over look that. to come up with the final grade.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

SUMMARYThe famous John Conner is all grown up now, and yes, you guessed it, is still being hunted down by robots sent from the future.  But this time around, its no ordinary robot.  The Terminatrix is far more superior in speed, strength and intelligence than John Conner's only chance for survival.  Yes, the Terminator is back, but he has to protect not only John Conner, but also a mysterious young woman whose purpose throughout the war with the machines appears to be unknown.
FUN FACTOR: 95%This movie is one fun thing to watch.  Probably the most exciting movie to watch this year, and that includes The Matrix: Reloaded.  Every scene in this action masterpiece, even the dramatic scenes, is vividly interesting. I remember when I was watching this movie in the theater, and halfway through I dropped my hot dog on my shirt.  And it was nasty, all this relish and onion and ketchup all over.  But, I didn't really care; I just kept on watching.  Maybe, I'm just crazy.
ACTING: 85%Well, lets start with none other than The Terminator.  With a far greater arsenal of humorous lines and actions (the reoccurring scenes with the sunglasses), the Terminator's ""personality"" is far more expressed in this film than in the previous two.  And the new additions of Claire Danes and Nick Stahl efficiently make up for the missing Linda Hamilton.  The T-X (Terminatrix) shows as much emotion as she can, which is not much.  But, hey, she's a killing robot.  Still, overall, decent acting by the main stars, and great improvement by Arnold in the comedy department.
STORY: 80 %What made the first two installments classics was the storyline.  Its intricate plot, full of twists of time travel effects, the first two movies were not only action movies, but thrillers.  And, this element is what lacks in T3.  Now, this is such a bad thing.  T3 just happens to be more of an action movie.  The movie had some elements of time travel and the future war here and there, but not as much as the first two.  Still, the end of the movie (I'm not going to give anything away) left me with a bunch of questions.  And thats a good thing.  A really good thing.
DIRECTION: 85%When I found out that James Cameron was not going to do the upcoming Terminator, I thought this is going to be a blowout.  But it wasnt. Jonathan Mostow took the job, and made an excellent movie.  I have to admit, T3 has a totally different look from the last two.  While the first two were darker, T3 is more explosion.  Its mainly because T-1000, equipped with only his hands and the shapes they can become, relies more on stealth and close combat.  With that type of enemy, the atmosphere of the movie must always be dark.  In T3, however, the T-X relies on guns and, therefore, at-a-distance type combat.  That creates more explosions and less blood.  That's another thing, T3 is not even close to being as violent as the first two.  To sum up, T3 has a lighter look compared to its predecessors, but is still successful in this transition.
FINAL IMPRESSION: ---86%With an excellent cast of characters, breathtaking action scenes, and a little bit of fresh humor added in, T3 is, undoubtedly, a worthy addition to a classic series.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
892,texasbill,"Enjoyable, but not up to I or II",5,2 July 2003,"I strongly suspect the prior commenter either has a specific financial stake or is otherwise tied to the ""biz.""  Straight up, this is a light and entertaining film.  I don't feel ripped off, but I won't give a strong recommendation to my friends.On a plot level... To me, T1 was gripping.  It generated fear.  I would not use those terms for T2, but there was still some intrigue and uncertainty, and some angles to the plot.  T3 didn't have any of that.  No one in my theater feared the villain or expected it to succeed.  In fact, even when the plot placed the bad guy in a close position to Terminate (within 10 feet SEVERAL times!), nonchalance followed, permitting escape.  Obviously in T1 the villain was relentless and unwavering.  Though I felt T2's villain was not as terrifying, I must give that he was relentless and if he got close he would execute immediately.  Yet in T3 - I just have to call it nonchalance. Not scary at all!Arnold holds up his end and if he's what floats your boat you'll be fine with this.  But make no mistake - this is not James Cameron level material. It's not awful, but don't expect anyone to be swept off their feet by this.One more technical note: if you don't instantly recognize the opening and closing theme music from T1, disregard this.  I would say to the directors and producers of T3: shame on you.  Brad Fiedel's composition would have lifted this whole affair - as great scores can, turning scenes into emotional experiences - but Brad and Cameron will do doubt share their quality in other projects down the road :)",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
893,submitor,James Cameron is Missed,5,4 July 2003,"From beginning to end you could say this movie is missing all the things that made T2 such a remarkable movie in 1991.The artistic style of James Cameron is gone, replaced with a dizzying fast-paced shoot-em-up.  The character development that played such an important role in T2 and T1 is missing.  It's replaced with a quick intro about a neurotic man named John Conner, and a stereotypical daddy's girl who has a hotshot father in a secret military facility.The whole anticipation of the Terminators finding John Conner is missing, replaced with a quick cut into a vet's office where ironically both Terminators find John Conner and Punky Brewster...err I mean Kate Brewster.After that point, there isn't much time for explanation, it's just shoot this, shoot that, leading to a bland ending that could be used to milk the series for another few summers.This movie was completely half-assed by directors, writers, and producers who weren't interested in reliving one of the James Cameron's greatest movie series of all time, but just using the name to sell tickets so they can suck the series dry before Arnold gets too old.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
894,Skapare,An insult to the series,1,19 February 2007,"T3 is an okay movie, I guess. It has some glaring errors, lapses of logic and inconsistencies with its predecessors, but it has its moments. The best of those moments send shivers down my spine because of the way they echo the predecessors.Yes, the best this movie has to offer is that it's built on a pair of awesome movies. They lift it up, make it touch greatness, and in return it spits on their memory.I guess my problem with T3 is that T1 and T2 make up a legendary, unparalleled, not to mention complete story. T3 has nothing to add to them. T2 ends on a positive note, building a fragile hope that the future might not be lost, and T3 smashes it by not only showing that the apocalypse was inevitable all along, and nothing the earlier two movies accomplished amounted to anything, but also shows the nukes flying and the world ending, substituting hope for mindless destruction.I am constantly revolted that people seem to think this movie is a valid part of the Terminator series. To me it feels like fan fiction, an untrained artist lacking a vision of his own finger-painting his unskilled additions on the Last Supper. With permanent colors.That is to say, I urge you to judge this movie on its own, do not throw it in with its predecessors, for it is not worthy to stand in the presence of such as these. Judge it on its own and notice how utterly it fails to stand on its own.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
895,Aporkalypse,Wow! It Sucked!,4,7 July 2003,"I really don't have much to say about the movie, words escape me.Cheesy one-liners and merchandising are going to dominate new franchises, this I can begrudgingly understand, but when you DESTROY a series like those responsible for T3 have... well...My advice? If you loved the first two then please, by all means, go and see this movie with an open mind, I wouldn't expect this review to stop anyone from seeing it for themselves, but don't go in with high hopes.It will take millions at the box office, millions through merchandising, millions through rental and millions through retail. Which means that crap like this will be made every summer from now until forever!The only main character to really come out of this looking remotely decent was Claire Danes, and that's because she looks hot AND she can act! Loken... I'm looking at you!",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
896,Tony_Almeida,does not stand up to its predecessors.......,6,28 November 2003,"Terminator 3 is different to its predecessors in both look and story and while it does not stand up to the first two, I think Jonathan Mostow has done a commendable job. Considering he had to follow up such highly regarded sci-fi films, the outcome is more than acceptable and does not ruin the Terminator name.
Much like his previous film Breakdown, Mostow is more concerned with keeping a breakneck pace and the level of tension high at all times. This often comes at the expense of character development and logic, but it hardly matters, as this movie is great fun from start to finish.(Possible Spoilers)Nick Stahl gives a reasonable performance as John Connor, who has now isolated himself from people and lives in fear. We learn that Judgement Day never occurred and was only postponed due to the events in Terminator 2. Now this time a female terminator, the TX (Kristanna Loken), has been sent back in time to stop John Connor from leading the revolution against the machines and another terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) has been sent to protect him. T3 principally follows the same plotline as T2 with an increased emphasis on action. The introduction of Clare Danes, as Kate Brewster, adds a strong female presence to the film and it just so happens that the writers found an inventive way to implement her into the story.The action scenes in T3 are the highlight. What is great to see in this time of overblown CG effects is a film that is heavy on real stunts and practical special effects. The crane chase is certainly up there as one the great movie chases even surpassing the CG reliant freeway chase in The Matrix Reloaded.T3 delivers some memorable action scenes, special effects and adequate story. Just as long as you don't expect something that will top its god-like predecessors, you will have an enjoyable ride.7 out of 10",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
897,martin-doyle,T3 - a 'What if' movie?,5,4 August 2003,"The first question that came to mind was 'Should I see it?' With no Jim Cameron it seemed a little pointless. However, I had to go have a look. Now that I have, I feel rather indifferent to it. T3 is a high-octane action movie, a great Saturday night popcorn film and lots of fun. And in that respect everything is OK. But next to the other two movies, this film isn't worthy of the Terminator history. T1 was a scary film for me, I saw it when I was still at school especially when Reece tells Sarah that the terminator won't stop till she is dead. T2 was incredible! It kept the essence of T1 without being effected by a bigger budget. These two films had intensity, excellent pacing and PRESENCE. T3 lacked all of these elements. When a terminator in T3 walked or stood and looked at something, you didn't feel their power, and the TX, unfortunately, wasn't intimidating and although the TX had more gadgets that any T model she still seemed inferior to the T1000. Above all else there was no emotional connection to any of the characters including Arnie. The story doesn't jibe that well with the other two films (Didn't Skynet need the Terminator CPU to become aware?) T3 dealt more with fate as where the time travel was a plot device in the other two films rather than a theory to be explored. That's why I will see this as a 'What if' film. A non-official look at what would have happened if everything went wrong.  As far as I am concerned T2 ended the story. James Cameron's absence from the T3 production as a whole was more than noticeable(Act 1 blurred into act 2 and before you knew it - it was the end!). At the end of the day you should still see this film as a bit of entertainment, there's nothing wrong in that at least, and although Arnie looks older, his energy hasn't diminished one bit! 6 out of 10!",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

900,filman79,The best action movie this summer,8,25 July 2003,"Bottom line: while not as epically cast as 'Terminator 2' nor as low-budget gritty as the original 'Terminator,' 'Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines' delivers precisely what it set out to do -- create high-budget kinetic fun with characters by now so familiar that dialogue is rarely ever necessary -- which is much much more than one can say about almost every other film this summer. (The exceptions, of course, are 'X2,' 'Finding Nemo' and '28 Days Later.') Der Arnold fits his role like finely-cut body-built hand to black- leather glove, and new-to-the-series director Jonathan Mostow injects a very welcome sense of knowing humor into the proceedings. Meanwhile, somehow Nick Stahl and Claire Danes manage to not only avoid the curse of the young-pretty-talented-actor- cast-in-overwhelming-Hollywood-spectacle, but actually ELEVATE the film with their subtle, emotionally grounded performances.8/10",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
901,Platypus-Man,"Good action, horrible story",3,15 April 2004,"When I first heard T3 would hit screens, I was expecting it to be of same quality as previous ones, cause I really liked the first two Terminators. Then I heard Cameron wasn't signed to do it. And when I arrived to the cinema and the movie started, I realised my worst fears were true.SPOILERS AHEADMovie started off with horrible voice-over, which explained the situation, so instead of revealing the story bit by bit with mystery factor (like previous ones), it was spat on our face, ready for mindless action. I actually regret paying so much money for seeing this movie. Action was well done, but that doesn't excuse the lack of story, which seemed to be there only to connect all the pointless actionscenes. It seemed like a spoof of first two installments. Although I liked Arnies performance, Nick Stahl and Claire Danes were pretty bad. They didn't connect at all and the part where Kate finds out her fiancee has been killed is really really bad. But don't worry - she'll laugh at it with John in a couple of minutes.NO MORE SPOILERSOnly pleasant surprise was the ending (which I'm not gonna spoil for you). Oh yeah... and T-X is pretty hot ;) Rent it and watch it with friends after a couple of beers. Don't expect it to be as good as previous ones. Good sci-fi has been sucked out of it.

One long chase, really, with a not-altogether-convincing romantic plot, clever touches that must've played great on paper but thudded on-screen, but with nothing really so offensive to make you angry. A nice, fast-moving B-movie.In the original, things were so much tighter. The old saw where if the audience has to work harder to fill in plot holes than the screenwriters seemed to was in full force. In the original, there was a reason to use a big model for the terminator - tech was lower, and the bulk and armor gave him an advantage. Why a girl? The T-1000 had no problem emulating females, so any kind of infiltration doesn't wash. Why have killer robots in storage with full magazines? Was Skynet the virus (if not, what was it), or the anti-virus that failed (if I just missed it, mea culpa)? In T2, Skynet had a good reason for genocide - it was self-defense against an immediate, clear threat (it woke up to discover it was about to be killed precise for that reason). Here, it was apparently ""just evil""... or something?Still, it had a good beat and people were dancing, so I give it a 6.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
903,abyboom-1,How to pass Judgement on the Day I saw T3?,7,29 March 2004,"********** Spoilers ********Well, what can I say? It's still Terminator chasing Terminator and John, plus a host of new chracters. Mind blowing Action and FX and Arnold back in his Terminator boots is good enough for a funtime movie with popcorn.However, that not what I expect from a T movie. I am a siccccckkk fan of T movies, and to speak the truth after watching T3, I was not sure whether I was dissappointed or satisfied.I was very happy to see that it wasn't a complete dud like the Matrix Movies and also in the fact that making a Terminator sequel (especially after the emmensly successful T2), would be a very difficult proposition (especially with mentor Cameron not around), it doesn't fail to catch attention.What makes it disappointing is that it tries to make a mirrior image of T2. Now it's impossible to make something similar to T2 and not get criticised. T2 was perfect. And one can't beat perfection. And after waiting for all these years and watching T2 for around 100 times, I really wasn't hoping to see another T2 look-alike.Arnold's grown older in the years and he seems tired, but still delivers. What makes the film so weak is the script. It just looks like a concatenation of great action sequences one after the ohter. By the time you start comprehending it, lo! it's over.The film should have had a much longer run-time with space given to character interactions, which is totally absent in the movie. Plus, there are no sub-plots which takes your attention away from the main theme as so cleverly applied in T2. what made T2 stand alone shining in spite of T1's brillance, was the fact that it ultimately showed a new aspect of the Terminator, which was not viewed in T1. So that given away, and the audience knowing more or less all about T800 thanks to the previous movies, there was not much that T 800 could bring new in this movie. Especially, what I hated most was the slap stick humor of the terminator which is not expected from him. I mean, c'mon he's a killing machine deviod of any human interaction, how can he have humor? The T's humor in T2 stood apart beacuse it was incorporated situations where his brutality and ignorance of humans made it look humorous, rather than making it crack ludicrous jokes like ""Talk to the Hand"". I mean, if someone asks a terminator for money, what do u expect from it? Either, it kills him or if he's a good terminator gives a stare such that the quails way from him! but not here.Also, there are couple of situations in the movie which has been borrowed straight from Arnold's Commando. The car driving downhill amidst trees and the line ""I lied"". Not original at all! Again, some of Arnold's one liners are really inappropiate to the situation.Consider this: kate's father has just been hit by TX, T800 blast her off an elevator shaft, and while Kate's dad is in death thores what does he do? Does he go near him and tries to see what the injury is all about? No way- he stays there and says - ""She will be back"". I mean who gives a damn at that instant for that line!Now coming to John Connor! well, if this idiot is to be the leader of human resistance, God save us! The John we witnessed in T2 shows a rebelious quality and self proficency that made the audience feel like that he could be a leader in the future. Even at that age he single handly escapes the T1000 in a bike initially and gives insights into what needs to done correctly at times even when the adults were faultering (one instance that stands apart is the sequnces of T800's chip destrcution by Sarah!). Well, the T3 John is a confused mess. Not only does he try to scare Kate with a phony Gun, but also gets locked up by kate in a Dog cell! now, if you know that JD will not happen , you should be happy about it and go on with your life as a normal person. Again, if you are apprehensive about JD you should be doubly cautious about your surroundings, rahter than being a mess as portrayed in T3. Even at the finale, it is Kate who tells him what they were actually doing in the shelter! the idiot couldn't derive it on it's own. Also, if the leader of human resistance gets killed by a Terminator during the war beacuse he had ""weakness"" towards it, maybe skynet should not have bothered to sent 3 terminators in the past to kill such a wreck!
Next: Sarah Conner is missing having died of Leukemia! kate tries to fill in as a proxy for that strong female lead, and to tell the truth she does much better than John. but of course, she's no Sarah conner! maybe, if the script had been a bit more strong it would have had a better potrayal of her, which once again bring us back to the script! Was it really necessary to make T3 after such a brilliant and conclusive ending in T2? For my money: No. but then, T3 does bring in some refreshment in terms of concepts (it adds to a lot of confusion and inconsistencies as well!). It does try to put in the humanity angle a bit more than have been shown in the earlier T movies (totally absent in T1, but then t1 wasn't about humanity, it was about T800). They could have tried to propound it more in the movie and cut out the humor. (T movies are not meant to be funny). The greatest zenith in the movie is of course the TX. i mean, when you are going ga ga on a killer over it's sexuality, it's really impossible to fear it , something that was inspired by the previous terminators. And to be very frank, I could not see how Tx was more efficient that T1000 in weapons department except for it's hand doing some funny things. The intrinsic superioirty (if any) of TX over T1000 can never be seen ( Maybe the script wrtier could not come up with something better, viz., a lump of energy as was previously thought to be done). when you watch T1000 you directly see how superior it is to the previous T800. Well, i could see much of TX being superior to T1000. If someone do see it pleadse let me know!Finally, after all the bad pionts, the good point: the ending. Poetic, brilliant, but a comes a bit too late to repair the damage that has been done before, a saving grace one can say for the T series. It is totally open ended and gives a very good platform for anothet T movie. Now I know, that pulling it a bit, but if Mr. cameron can once again reprise his role as the captain of the terminator ship, and given due hard work, T4 will stand better than T3. And only then can the existence of T3 be justified.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
904,Jnarup24,Third Time's kinda the Charm...,5,16 December 2013,"This movie, in my opinion, is extremely underrated.It really isn't that bad at all. I'm not saying it's the series savior, in fact I think this movie is nothing compared to T1 and T2, but I'm just saying it's okay as a whole. The action is good, it kept me entertained throughout, and that sequence in the beginning when the T-X gets in a crane truck and chases John Connor is just awesome! What I thought to be the big plot twist was in the end when the T-X reprograms the T-800 to kill John actually kept me in suspense. Overall, the action sequences throughout the movie are done very well. Again, this movie is no where near the series savior. The acting has it's up and downs. Like I said, the crane scene was great, but after that the movie becomes extremely dramatic as they drive through the desert. It gets even more dramatic when John holds up a gun to his head just because Terminator won't do what he wants. Seriously? Quote Kyle from T1; ""It can't be bargained or reasoned with"". The acting...meh. It's OK throughout. Although it becomes obvious at sometimes that certain actors don't want to be there. The plot, for what it is, is OK. In my opinion this movie should have never happened, when in T2 they stop judgment day. This is mentioned in the middle of this movie, but never even questioned again. But, we got kind of a reason for this movie, whatever, let's move on. One thing that bothers me is that the killer Terminator is in the form of a girl (by default). I'm not against girls or anything, I just think the Terminator movies have a tradition of the Terminators being in the form of a boy by default, so the T-X doesn't really lead up to the franchise. Still, I kinda like that twist. This movie is good, but I still think the story ends at T2.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

Dialogue and acting was atrocious. Special effects were good, but then we've all learned to expect that these days with the amazing advances in computer animation, etc. However, T3 was fraught with so many technical mistakes. Anyone notice the huge white ""X"" in the middle of an intersection when during a chase scene, the car spun about in the middle of the intersection - obviously directed to do so on the conspicuous X. What about when the Terminator (Arnie) was walking back and forth at a campground fetching weaponry while John Connor and what's her name yapped. That scene must have had live audio recorded because with those heavy combat boots Schwarzie was wearing, his voice jarred with every step. If he was the robot he was advertised to be, his voice would not falter while he walked (oh, unless someone wants to argue that the machines had thought of every way to emulate human physical dynamics). No. Had real thought been put into this movie, it could have been much better and much scarier. I loved the original Terminator movie. This sequel was (as my gut instinct told me it would be) a disappointment. So I just sat back and enjoyed it for the FX and I replaced some of their dialogue with my own ideas that would have made it funnier. Some business, this Hollywood.

I can put up with over the top action which Hollywood loves now it has digital stunt men but action flicks are becoming just too stupid and T3 follows this trend. Arnie takes more of a beating in the first few scenes than in the previous two films together and comes out without a scratch. T1 and 2 despite their sci-fi fantasy still adhered to real life rules such as big metal robot hitting walls will cause damage, not in T3. We've all seen a Terminator endo-skeleton and the pistons controlling the neck and head so how does Arnie put his head back on after the TX lops it off?T1 and 2 were classic thought provoking films that reminded you of the fragility of human life and made you feel sad about the state of the world, T3 has none of this, instead relying on action and dumb jokes that are out of place.If you want to watch a film matching the quality of the previous installments then you'll be disappointed, if you just want an easy to watch mindless action movie then enjoy.2/10",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

John Connor is supposed to be a badass but instead hes played by a short dweeby guy who seems like hes more relation to flanders then to the John Connor I know from terminator two. I mean how is this guy supposed to save the world?! his 13 year old counterpart from the past could kick his ass!

Terminator 3 just lacks the suspense, the good catch lines, the action, the excitement, or any of the other factors that the other Terminators had.If you have time to waste, sure go see it.

The terminators Arnold and kristanna were good it was good to see a girl terminator this time and the action was OK but nearly every action sequence was used with computer effects and that just disappointed me at least in the last two the action seemed more realistic. Seriously the only reason i watched this was because of Arnold's character who i have always loved but the story and action was pretty weak...if only James Cameron made T3.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

Good, we can get straight to the point then.In the ending of T2, John Connor and Terminator eliminated all possibility of Skynet and Judgement Day happening. Thereby changing the future by altering the past, a popular SFI-FI time travail concept.The series would have been fine if they left it, but they didn't, they had to go into the other time travail concept; You can't change the past. So they just HAD to bring back the Terminator, completely screwing up the canon of the series; ""They sent back two terminators"" (Opening lines of T2) and they also just HAD to have a female Terminator, which is fine, but with the whole ""you've got to travail in the buff"" thing, they also probably HAD to focus on TX's behind, I don't remember if they did or not though.In fact, they only real good parts of T3 were the special effects, which were nothing special.T3 is not my first choice.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

He has made some poor ones, but he has clearly established himself as the biggest action star in the past 15 years. With that said... WTF was he thinking letting this movie go to theaters. It was a massive train wreck. Nick Stahl? He blew but I could deal with it. Clare Danes should be kicked out of Hollywood. She was pa - the - tic! Her acting and the awful story killed this movie. In fact I could start my own forum and talk about how bad of an actress she is. Terrible. Arnold did his thing, but with a poor as dirt story he was a non factor. I actually walked out of the theater on this one. The other movies I've walked out of... Speed 2 and Muppett Treasure Island. Yeah, T3 was THAT bad.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
912,jamesrovira,"Good, but not good enough",6,29 January 2006,"It's a good, entertaining film for fans of the previous two Terminator films, but it doesn't make enough of an effort, so ends the series on an anticlimactic note. For example, the new Terminator of the second film was a dramatic improvement over the Terminator of the first, while the villain machine of T3 is the same as the previous one with the exception of being a female machine that accessorizes.The adult John Connor has less juevos than even Claire Danes' character, who surprisingly impresses in this film as she does in all her work. I didn't expect her to do well in an action film and she demonstrated herself to be capable of some of the moxie of a Uma Thurman or Angelina Jolie. I hope she makes more action films. Unfortunately, in this film the action sequences make no attempt to go beyond anything accomplished in the previous two films. There is one exceptional car chase scene that rivals the freeway chase scene of the Matrix trilogy, but this expected device is the film's highlight.The film departs philosophically from the previous two: human victories were previously believed to create an open ended future. This film, in contrast, ends on a fatalist note; the future is determined and our only responsibility is to survive. For this reason this is possibly the last film in the series; all that is left is to depict the human/machine war after Judgment Day or the future they build after beating the machines.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
913,athlynne81,This is like a bad dream...,1,27 October 2005,"How could they do this? How could James Cameron let them? T2 was and is the only reason I ever give action movies a chance. Its heart and simple but powerful theme has haunted me ever since I was a child, when I would stay up all night and watch it while everyone was asleep, so not a single sound would distract me. It to me is so much more than great special effects that were astounding for their time, more than a huge action blockbuster. It was and is a portrait of humanity's struggle against the horrors we create for ourselves, of the cruelty of fate, of the power of family. It is an example of all the right elements coming together at the right time to create something so powerful and moving that it has inspired a force of loal fans who seem to feel the same outrage I do about T3.T2 ended with a sense of hope for the future, leaving us all the gift of being able to imagine ourselves the fate of the world. No one could've devised a better ending to the story. T3 (and now T4, I hear) are lame excuses to use a popular name and popular characters to continue a story in a way that sends it spiraling down from the intelligence and power it had in T2. It infuriates me that anyone would cheapen an excellent movie with unnecessary and inferior sequels. Does anyone in Hollywood bother to think up *original* ideas anymore? Maybe I should stop coming up with my own ideas for screenplays and novels and, I don't know, pen a crappy sequel to E.T. ::sigh:: The casting probably bothers me more than anything else, oddly enough, though I would have protested any superfluous sequel no matter who it starred. Frankly, Claire Danes should not be on camera. EVER. Anyone who made the mistake of seeing the trashy remake of Romeo and Juliet, made for those who can't bear the pain of cracking a book, will get what I'm saying. She acts like she's reading off a cue card, and that really only works for Arnold, who will never get my vote for betraying the Terminator story. Linda Hamilton, who gave a stunning performance in T2, was smart enough to stay away, and I hope Eddie Furlong, who did a remarkable job in T2, especially considering he'd never acted before, never sees the imbecile they replaced him with.I guess the people behind T3 thought they were terribly clever using a female villain, the reasoning being, I suppose, ""Hey, she has boobs! That will make up for our utter lack of plot!"" I shudder to think what T4 will be throwing at us. Maybe John Connor's future children will fight the machines a la Spy Kids, and Hilary Duff can provide the soundtrack. Sadly enough, if T3 was possible, anything is.The nightmare continues. Since sequels are proving how undefeatable those machines are, maybe they can transport me back to 1992, so I can prevent this from happening.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
914,jford-19,A solid if flawed follow up,8,5 September 2007,"A lot of people thought this movie was a bad idea before it even materialised which meant that there was always going to be hostility to the finished product. Personally, i thought it was a cool idea - provided the filmmakers could come up with a good story. The end product beats the expectations of the haters but falls short of producing a truly amazing follow up.The plus points of this movie are the amazing fx and chase scenes. The crane truck chase is one of my favourite action movie scenes ever, and is timed perfectly. The story line has been pushed along, with the realisation that Judgement Day cannot be stopped. This comes true at the end of the film with the bombs going off while some gentle classical music plays in the background. It's incredibly poignant for a Terminator movie and a great way to end the film. And of course, seeing Arnold as the now iconic Terminator when we all thought he'd bogged off to be a politician is a very welcome sight.There are however, a lot of niggles that add up to a fair amount of disappointment for the true fans. Nick Stahl takes some getting used to and Claire Danes is just terrible with her granny hair cut and bad clothes. The return of Dr. Silberman is unnecessary, as is the gay sunglasses joke. The most annoying aspect is in the continuity - the van that the good guys are driving hits at least 2 other vehicles at high speeds and gets squashed between 2 cop cars as well as being spun 360 yet when it is seen afterwards for a good few scenes it is intact! I can't believe this terrible blooper made it through! Its so obvious, even on first watch that it spoils the film for me.Yet despite it's flaws T3 is a good solid action film, just like the recent Die Hard 4.0 - you know what you're getting and OK its a bit old hat, but for thrills alone it's definitely worth a watch.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

Funny, exciting, well-acted (you know, for a Terminator movie), and with just enough ""this is the future of the world"" punch to make you realize what this series has always been about.The lengthy crane chase scene holds its own with any action set piece ever designed, in my opinion, and the sexually charged final battle of the terminators is also quite will done.It may be ""the most expensive B movie ever made"", but it's also the first true summer blockbuster in as long as I can remember. 9/10",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
916,tompage,A tragic continuation of two astounding films,1,16 August 2003,"I beg of you not to pay to watch this film. Doing do will only encourage further series-destroying sequels.The inventiveness, the atmosphere, the sincerity, the tension and so many other attributes of the first two films are gleefully swept away by this trash. Perhaps James Cameron is not the finest director in America, but after 109 painful minutes of this film you realise just what Cameron could do, and Mostow can't.The attempt to inject humour into this film at every opportunity was severely misjudged. Cameron's screenplay for the first and second film kept the tension high, explained the story without becoming over complicated and involved us with the characters. No fear of any of this with Terminator 3. After about twenty minutes I couldn't have cared less what happened to any of the characters, and Nich Stahl's acting is so lamentable that you are left to wonder who could have possibly been worse in the role.Mostow's direction is a mess, with scenes shot too close, removing style and clarity from chase scenes and reducing them to a bewildering array of explosions and broken glass. Eyes quickly glaze over, and you just know everything will work out in some way for our dull heroes.The special effects in this are not a patch on other recent productions, and the glossy computer animation of the terminators, especially during the opening future-war scene and Loken's weapon attachment are lacking all the ingenuity of the sublime T-1000 effects from 1991.Add to this mix an appalling score by Marco Beltrami that is instantly forgettable (surely a recognisable theme would have been the first priority in such a hackneyed film) and a complete irreverence for the story of the previous two films and you're left with a movie that makes you wish you hadn't seen it, and wish that the studio had left Cameron's work alone.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

922,yakkorat,Corrections & Review,10,2 July 2003,"A few corrections to the IMDB summaries: Arnold is the T-101 model, not the T-800, and I believe John is supposed to be 25, not 18.  (He makes reference in the movie to being 13 during the time of T:2 and then also makes reference to that being more than 10 years ago.  Also, it's been 12 years between films, and it would make decently logical sense for John to be 12 years older since both films take place in the current time.  And finally, if your local theater has an online summary of the movie, chances are they state John's age as 25 - check AMC Theaters, their summary says he's 25.)The film itself was excellent.  It was a perfect balance between a story driven drama and an action packed sci-fi.  Nick Stahl did a wonderful job, fully exceeding my expectations.  Schwarzenegger was as terrific as always. He somehow takes an unfeeling cybernetic organism and manages to make him loveable.  The TX is dutifully frightening and full of surprises.  The effects are stupendous!  All in all, a real treat.  It was a wonderful movie.My only disappointment was the absence of the Terminator theme throughout the film (although it did play during the closing credits).Also, I don't know how reliable this information is, but I've heard that Schwarzenegger has already expressed interest in returning for a third Terminator sequel (which would be excellent because the way this film ends leaves you clamoring for a fourth installment).",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

924,cigaart,Disappointing trash,6,3 July 2006,"The first thing one wonders about T3 is whether Arnie can still give the same performance he did in the previous two movies? If you watch this film, worrying about that, then you will eventually not be disappointed since Arnie's performance is top notch and is easily on par with the previous two. Problem is that the other characters in the movie were'nt giving it the same effort he was. Nick Stahl was completely inappropriate as John connor and comes across as a complete and utter loser incapable of doing anything while his pairing up with claire danes is nothing short of hilarious.

The Special effects were very nice, and the action sequences were intense.Fans of the originals will be really disappointed with this movie.P.S.

When i first heard that T3 was in the making i was actually quite pleased and thought that after such a long time they would have developed an interesting plot. What i was expecting was a much darker film than the first two, and perhaps one that would be more of an epic, great battles between men and machines, more thoughts and reflections concerning the issues that lies as the foundation for the movies. I was however, greatly disappointed with this film for more than one reason.Firstly i found the humour awfully misplaced and inappropriate. I couldn´t believe that they would do this to a movie that quite naturally had high demands from the audience, to me T3 is close to being an action/comedy, and that´s not meant in a good sence... Secondly the story is just bizarre, it´s all action and nothing else, mindless action with no substance. Maybe my expectations were too high but i just can´t help being so disappointed, the underlying theme and thought behind this movie could have made it great, but right now i´m thinking that the time i spent watching T3 is never coming back to me, makes me a little bit angry actually....",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

Just take a look at Earl Boen's character who was given a rude awakening in T2, much to audiences' satisfaction, and in T3 is brought in for a quick cameo that completely mocks his role in Judgment Day! And for the biggest shame of all: the Terminator is no longer an unstoppable, ultra-violent, killing machine, but a one-liner spouting gentle giant! And the TX! Well if trying to imitate Robert Patrick's vicious T-1000 (and poorly, at that) and inflating one's bust while wearing tight leather is scary, than slap me senseless because I was too busy laughing!

932,TheBigPulsatingBrain,"Why, why, why?",6,31 July 2003,"I am writing this review fresh from visiting my local multiplex, viewing the latest installment of the Terminator series ""T3: Rise of the Machines"". I am a huge fan of the first two films directed by James Cameron and can only feel sympathy for Jonothan Mostow in trying to fill those boots. But then I just ask why did he bother? Cameron wrapped the whole story up very well in the sad conclusion of T2, and I can see why he baulked at the opportunity of helming a second sequel. I can see it even more when he read the script for T3. You can only imagine the meeting. 'Hi Mr. Cameron we would like to look at our script for T3'. 'A script for T3. But that was my idea. I thought up the whole thing. Why are you making a sequel to something I ended so brilliantly the first time around?'. 'Yes Mr. Cameron, but there's going to be lots of special effects...and a big car chase...and, er'. This was the biggest problem, although The Terminator and T2 by genre are a horror and a action film respectively, Cameron did convey a convincing moral message about the future of humanity, in his storyline through the relationships of his central characters to one another. This was shown through Reece's love for Sarah Conner (which even transends time) and the most human trait of all being a mother's love for her son, between Sarah and her son John. Apposed to these very human relationships is the cold, destructive, emotionless machine, the Terminator. Unfortunatly these elements had been threwn out in the script for this film, and therefore nothing for the viewer to attach themselves too. As for the cast Arnie was dependably wooden as ever for the role of the T-101 (how he kept a straight face for some of the one liners IS amazing). I haven't seen much of Nick Stahl (played John Conner)before but he seemed wrong for the role (didn't seem to have the street smarts Ed Furlong had in T2) and Care Danes seemed to be confused as to what her role was supposed to be. The one saving grace of this film was Kristanna Loken as the T-X. She stole the film (don't the bad guys always do this?) and looked like she really relished the role, I thought she was a real jewel. Hats of again to ILM, who although not superceding anything the Matrix sequels have done (I'm assuming Matrix Revolutions will blow our socks off), they continue to impress. So overall, I thought T:3 was a bit of a waste of time, and Mr. Cameron will probably be sat smugly thinking 'I knew I was right all along!'",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

Such as the classic Arnold clearing an area of police vehicles then doing a scan to compute how many casualties he's caused. (0%)The TX seemed to be doing her best to mimic Robert Patrick's T-1000, and that too is part of the problem. I know the T-1000. I've spent years studying the T-1000. Dear, you are no T-1000. You'd think that since she's supposed to be even more advanced than the T-1000 SkyNet would have been able to make her less ""robotic"" in her movements and speech.

935,Tone303,Why I think Terminator 3 doesn't deliver! - Spoilers,6,27 November 2004,"I am a HUGE Terminator fan. I have seen both the first two movies inside out and backwards. Here is why I do not believe that Terminator three belongs on the same level as the first two. Forgive me if I leave out any information in my arguments and should anyone feel the desire to argue my points, then by all means you're more than welcome. The first thing that got me about the third movie was the emotion both the terminators showed. The terminator was set up as a relentless killing machine that doesn't show pity, remorse or fear, simply systematic destruction. Ironically, during the scene when the terminator is reprogrammed by the T-X he explains to John (rather emphatically) that he is a machine. That line would have been much more effective had it been delivered with the cold, hard apathy we saw in the first two terminators. Another emotional moment for the terminator was the T-X this time. *(This shouldn't be a spoiler but use discretion anyway) Just before the T-X is defeated she shows fear! If the terminator can't cry in the second movie after all he's been through, I find it very hard to believe that this T-X can be afraid.*(Potential Spoilers in the following paragraph) That whole thing with the power cell really annoyed me. In the first terminator, he is crushed under a hydraulic press. He didn't blow up! In the third, they suddenly make it that if he suffers a massive blow to the chest he is in danger of exploding. Further more, I understand that this next comment could be taken as being a little nit-picky, but I believe it has to be said. At the end of the second movie the terminator specifically states that he cannot self-terminate, yet at the end of the third movie he decidedly drops the door on himself and the T-X, knowing it would destroy them both.OK, John Conner is a wimp in this movie. By the end of the second movie he is supposed to be half ready for the war, and before Sarah died, she was supposed to have taught him to be a ""Great military leader"". How much of this showed in the third now that Judgment day was right around the corner? Also, Cyberdyne Systems was destroyed in the second movie, along with all traces of the terminator. This should have prevented the war. OK, so it never, it only postponed it. *(Spoiler alert) Skynet turns out to be a virus, that becomes self aware, and will construct the terminator (Cyberdyne Systems model 101) based on what? Huh? Military records? How did they get them if Cyberdyne systems was destroyed? Even if Skynet developed this model of the terminator through some kind of cybernetic evolution, he still wouldn't have been developed in the short amount of time they gave in the movie.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

As expected, the main attractions in this movie are the computer generated effects and the beautiful actresses (this time around the machine-sent terminator takes the form of the sexy Kristanna Loken). Nothing is surprising in this film, it takes the exact same things that made the first 2 movies a hit and jumbles them all back together into this bland product. Special effects are okay, nothing too exciting or innovative, and the plot is just dumb.

I seriously liked this move alot!!!Great special effects nice acting and cool fighting scenes!This movie on a scale of 1 to 10,I gave it a ten!I really recommend this move!It really is great to have Arnold back!Though,the only flaw of this move is that it is not as brutal as the first 2 terminator movies!But,theres a seen where T-X punches threw a cop!And few other brutal scenes.This indeed is one of the best movies of summer!Rated R for Strong sci-fi action and violence,and for Language and Brief nudity.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
941,jim_snowden,Not sure why they told us this story,6,29 July 2003,"I came out of this movie with mixed emotions. The special effects were good, the chases were tense and the backstory of this new Terminator's relationship with John Connor was clever. Still, there was a fatalism throughout the movie that reduced the impact of the ending. The movie essentially says to us, ""This is the way things will turn out...things are turning out as I predicted...I was right, this was the way turned out."" Not only does this ruin suspense, but it also means that whenever someone dies in the picture, instead of pitying the dead, we shrug and move on. It alienates us from the movie and its characters when we want to feel close, and by the end my reaction to the story paralleled that of the kid in The Princess Bride who screams, ""Jeez, grampa, why did you want to tell me this story!""",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
942,magicmonkey,"Surprisingly good! But in this movie John Connor is an impotent, indecisive, half-wit!",7,23 December 2003,"I was prepared for the worst ... but hey it was pretty good! I'd give this movie about 7/10 ... it could have been 8/10 or better ... were it not for the badly scripted role of the John Connor character. In this movie John Conner is an impotent, indecisive, half-wit!After the T2 you'd think this guy would be more clued in! Yet in here he seems pretty confused by the whole scenario. He even goes and has a little hissy fit in the mausoleum ""why me? why me?"" ... idiot your mom's been telling you this your whole life ... now's not the time to act like a pathetic twit! This is the guy who's going to lead the human race? He was supposed to be trained to be a soldier and a leader ... yet he's reduced to the role of a spectator in most of the action scenes! In some of the most climactic scenes Connor is portrayed to have no sense of urgency! There are several scenes where, in the face of danger, he hesitates and stares dumbly at the approaching menace before running away rather impotently. There's even a scene where he and his 'future wife' are frozen in shock as the TX approaches ... and all the while a gun is lying on the ground in front of them. Guess who picks up the gun? The girl! By the end of this movie I want John Conner to die! I don't care if the whole human race will die with him.If this is the best leader we can come up with its about time we're all replaced by machines.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
943,Eccentric Brit,Very good movie which almost lives up to its predecessors,8,8 July 2003,"Despite the views of some critics, I found this movie to be a solid piece of entertainment. Following on the heels of the 1984 sci-fi action classic ""The Terminator"" and its sequel ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"", the plot once again centres around an attempt by machines from the future to eliminate John Connor, the man destined to become the saviour of humankind.Still afraid for his life, John now lives ""off the grid"" with no phone or known address to avoid being traced. One can understand his reasons, since a shapeshifting liquid metal cyborg (in the guise of T2's Robert Patrick) tried to kill him when he was still a child. Despite that the foretold nuclear war on August 29, 1997 (see the earlier flicks) failed to materialise, John still suspects all has not been set right. His fears are justified when another cyborg assassin, the T-X who assumes the form of a 5' 11'' blonde female, is sent back to eliminate his unsuspecting lieutenants (initially at least) on the eve of the postponed -- not averted -- nuclear war in the hope of changing the outcome of the future war between humans and sentient machines bent on their destruction. Once again, the resistance sends back another terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger, who else?) to protect John from the more advanced model. Why not send back a T-1000 or T-X instead? Well, I suppose capturing a liquid man (or woman) alive would be somewhat difficult, so it kinda makes sense.There are many absentees from the earlier movies, notably Linda Hamilton (John's mother Sarah in T1 and T2), Edward Furlong (John in T2) and not least the writer/director John Cameron. This time, the director is Johnathan Mostow, whose previous credits include Breakdown and U-571. However, I feel the director brought a new feel to the movie and all worked out quite well.Newcomers Nick Stahl and Claire Danes (who plays Katherine Brewster, one of John's future lieutenants) aquit themselves quite well and have good on-screen chemistry. Kristanna Loken (the supermodel turned actress who plays the T-X) is very convincing and has the same icy look that Robert Patrick had in T2. Arnold is getting a bit old for this type of movie now, but he still has the screen presence needed to liven things up.The movie is generally more light hearted than its two predecessors, though there is the odd dark scene mixed in. There are plenty of gags, some of which are effective and some which don't quite work. The T-X's abilities are interesting. Without giving too much away, she is somewhat a hybrid of the T-101 and T-1000, a metal endoskelton with advanced weapons surrounding by liquid metal, able to assume the forms of other people and control other machines (which leads to some interesting situations).T3 is entertaining throughout. Most of the movie is spent with the T-X chasing the heroes (and heroine), kind of similar to T1, but without the prolonged story-driven sections in the middle of T2. There are some very good action sequences, notably a chase seen early on, although I feel they could have made the movie a little longer (perhaps just over two hours) with a more climatic fight between the T-101 and T-X. Despite a good earlier fight scene, she is despatched a little too easily at the end, considering she is supposed to be an anti-terminator terminatrix (according to the T-101 anyway). The fight between the T-101 and T-1000 in the steel mill at the end of T2 was superior, as was the battle between Sarah and the T-101 in the Cyberdyne factory in the original. Also, there are sections where they don't really use the T-X as well as they could have. I think some of the gory sections (which would have made her a more scary character and on a par with Robert Patrick) were cut. For instance, she threatens a cop but we don't actually see him die. There's also a scene where she saws somebody up but we only see the splattering blood.All in all, an entertaining summer blockbuster (not quite as good as X2 but better than the Matrix Reloaded) and a worthy follow up, though not as groundbreaking as the previous two films.Eccentric Brit rates it 8/10 (T1 and T2 both 9/10)",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
944,phuntley,Exactly what I expected - I'd even see it again.,8,18 July 2003,"This movie was exactly what I expected it to be.  It wasn't as good as Terminator 2, but it was still a very entertaining action movie, with a few neat ideas thrown in to boot.  The acting was decent(Claire Danes I especially liked, and Arnold is great as usual),even if the movie was heavily weighted towards action scenes, and the new female terminator really rocks.My favorite part of this movie was the ending... it ties everything together, and leaves you wondering.  I don't want to spoil it, but I thought it was an excellent twist, that left me thinking about it days later.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
945,sustinererex,Solid Arnold Action Flick,8,1 July 2003,I went into this movie with a very low expectation.  After so many bad movies this summer I was sure they were going to ruin Terminator as well. That however did not occur.  The filmmakers obviously knew that they were not up to the task of coming up with a coherent story line so they just decided to have two hours of non-stop violence.  Add to the mix some outstanding one-liners and very twisted time humor and you end up with a movie that was refreshingly good.  If you are looking for a film that will get you emotionally involved as you watch the characters struggle with themselves to grow...this is the wrong film.  If on the other hand you just really want to see a bunch of stuff get blown up then this movie is right for you.  8/10,Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
946,cbubeck,Great summer movie....,9,24 July 2003,"Not as good as t1 or t2 but still overpassed my expectations, thinking that this is the 3rd movie in the series and James cameron wasnt directing it i was expecting a blow out, but i got the opposite, i didnt get what i got from the prior films ( got u thinkin bout how the world will end) but i got a great action film and lots of comic relief. The ending was great but although pretty cheesy, but what can u expect from an Arnold movie? Great summer movie with amazing special effects( in my opinion better then the matrix reloaded), go see it, 8 or 9 out of 10.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
947,BNP,A Very Worthy Sequel,8,1 July 2003,"I can't believe it. After five years of reading through rumours and gossip, it has finally been unleashed. After a year of antcipating this movie and watching the previews over and over again ""it is time"". Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is here, and holy crap did come in style.This movie blows all of the other summer movies away.Before I go on, I must say this; MINOR SPOILERS (nothing drastic) will be given away.The movie opens with John Connor now in his 20's. He's living off the radar, and moves around a lot. He sort of a has been now. Since they stopped Judgment Day from happening ten years previous, he has nothing to live for really. However, he's still paranoid and never forgets what his mom taught him. But now another, highly advanced terminator (Kristana Loken) has been sent back to, well, terminate him. The T-X, as it's called, goes around and kills all of John's future Lieutenants. The T-X also goes after a girl named Kate Brewster (Claire Daines) who we find out has a very important role in the future war. The Human Resistance was able to send back another Terminator (Schwarzenegger) to protect Connor and Brewster. But which one will reach him first?Now, I'll get to the good stuff in awhile but first I want to mention the casting. The casting of Nick Stahl as Connor was great. I first saw Stahl in the Mel Gibson directed movie The Man With-out A Face. Then Stahl was just a kid, but he did a great job in the role he played. Stahl replaces Edward Furlong in the role of Connor and he does a great job at it. His performance is brilliant and the way he captures the character of a guy who knows that the world could be destroyed at anytime is excellent.The casting of Claire Daines as Kate Brewster was a smart move as well. I can't actually think of any other actress who would fit in this role. As much as I like Natalie Portman, I don't think she would have been believable in this role, and it would have just been her doing her Star Wars bit again. Daines and Stahl have some great chemistry on screen together and that really helps the movie. That's one thing that can always hurt a movie if people are supposed to like each other. Bad chemistry is noticeable, and it distracts from the picture.Now onto the choice role of the T-X, Kristana Loken. While she doesn't play the character as menacing as Robert Patrick's T-1000 character in T2, she does do a good job, at being the, sort of, innocent cute girl. She actually surprised me and did a good job. She's not a scary character, which is a shame, but she's a tough one. I wasn't to keen on the idea of a female terminator, I though it would be handled wrong, but I was wrong. I suppose that's what I get for under-estimating Jonathan Mostow, who did good job with this movie.Sure T3 isn't as good as the first two. I didn't expect it to be, and it doesn't bother me. First of all, it's a different director and writers. The James Cameron Terminator movies are far superior to this one, but this one is still a worthy sequel.Mostow, who directed the great Kurt Russell thriller 'Breakdown' and the tense submarine thriller 'U-571', handles this movie really well. He pays homage to the original Terminator movies as well as adding his own spin on it.This one isn't as 'dark' as the other ones were, but it still works. I have said for awhile now, that this movie will either crush Mostow's career, or give him the respect he deserves. And it looks like I'm right.
Mostow has an eye for action, and a well placed eye that is. Most of the action in this movie is way better than most of the other action in any of the previous summer action movies.And another good thing is it never lets up. The action just keeps coming. What a thrill ride. The massive car chase near the beginning was brilliant. I said the Matrix: Reloaded car chase was good, but this one is far better, mainly because it uses REAL cars and real stunts. It doesn't rely on CGI to make explosions and cars crash.The first car chase, or rather truck chase, is fun and thrilling. It involves a crane truck and Arnie chasing the T-X on a police motorcycle. It's too much to talk about it, but it's great. What I also liked about this chase was something very subtle. The chase started a night, but it ended during the day. I loved the fact that Mostow decided to have the sun come up during the chase. I don't know why. Probably because most car chases either happen during the day or night, never in between. It was a nice touch. Lame I know, but I liked it.The rest of the action is skillfully done and it was some neat stuff to see. A fight between the Terminator and the T-X had me worried for a minute that Woman's Rights Activists might sue the studio because of the beating Arnie gives the female T-X. But then she fought back, so I guess it evens the score.Also, I must mention Stan Winston. He worked on the previous two Terminators and even won an Academy Award for make-up and special effects on T2. He returns here, and does a stellar job. I love seeing the battle damage on the Terminator, with the Terminator skeleton popping out and flesh still hanging on. It's really neat make-up and job well done. I think another Academy Award might in sights for Winston.Now there was a lot of humour in this one. I laughed at a lot of it, and it was nice to kind of see Arnie play around and make fun of himself on screen. Like just after he gets his outfit and what he does. It was stupid, but I will admit, I laughed. It was harmless, but it could have done with-out it.Now, there were some things that I didn't like about T3. Yes, I know, hard to believe, eh? I didn't like some of the dialogue. It was weak at times, but all the goodness about this movie makes up for all the bad.I also didn't like the fact the classic Terminator theme was absent through out the whole movie. Now Marco Beltrami did a god job composing the movie. The soundtrack was great, it's just, I missed that Terminator theme. It's such an awsome theme, how could he not use it? Sure it appears in the end credits, but still?The story moves along at break neck pace and keeps rolling and rolling. The movie does slow down from time to time to explain things and further the story as well. I don't want to say anything about the story in general, but what I will say is that it's pretty good.In Roger Ebert's review he said `The ending must remain for you to discover, but I will say it seems perfunctory'. I disagree. I liked the ending. As did Ebert's reviewing buddy Richard Roeper. It does leave questions out there, but it also seems to say that, no matter how much we try, we are always doomed. You can't stop something from happening that's supposed to happen, you can only postpone it, and wait until it arrives to do what your fate has chosen for you to do.The ending was good. I liked it. I don't care what anyone says about it, it was good.So, now my closing comments, Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is a summer action movie that delivers. It doesn't have a complicated storyline that makes you stop paying attention and makes you just want to leave the theatre so bad (Matrix Reloaded). It doesn't rely heavily on CGI like the Matrix did, and when it has CGI, its damn good. It's not as noticeable or poorly done like the Matrix and Hulk were. It also has non-stop great action.It's a great movie and I know I've said this before, but I recommend seeing this. Go buy a ticket, buy some popcorn sit down and enjoy the lame, but fun, humour, the action and spectacular visuals.I have to say it, but Arnold is back everyone, and he's back in full force. Terminator 3 is here, and now its time for King Conan.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
948,nderrick,Arnold is damn funny,10,4 July 2003,"This movie is awesome.  Terminator is not about man against machine, it is not about the end of the world, it IS about one liners spoken in an austrian accent by a man who could at one point bench two of you put together.  I laughed so hard I almost got kicked out of the theatre.  By the way, cameron is the wrong guy for terminator.  he is too serious and deep.The new director finally realized terminator's potential as a comedy, and exploited arnold's arnoldness to create the most lighthearted and funny terminator yet.  It is too bad that all three weren't like this.  Anyone who complains about his movie is a loser who can't lighten up and just have a good time.  This is the best arnold flick since   ""Last Action Hero"".",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
949,i_am_the_beck,"Doesn't compare to the first 2, but still fun",7,3 July 2003,"Comparing this to the originals is a no win situation. It's inferior to both, but still a solid entry. It may irk some fans with the direction it goes, but overall...if you like action and some great Terminator lines then I think you'll enjoy it. I feared this movie would be a total piece of garbage, so my expectations weren't high. Because I wasn't anticipating a ""bar raising"" entry into the series I think it allowed me to enjoy it for what it was. It's Terminator Light...less thought goes into it and the pacing just screams forward. The frantic pace actually helps distract you from the problems with the script/plot. It's all about the action and nostalgic humor. You will have fun when you see this, but don't expect anything resembling the masterpiece of T2 that Cameron crafted. Oh, and Kristanna Loken is easily the hottest robot that has ever graced film...and she is entirely believable in her role.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

However the story was a little weak, there could have been more story lines in between the action.  Also the action was tamed down to a PG level,  What happend to the good old days back in the 80s with the maxium blood gore and vilolence R-Rated all the way.

952,fticket,I wanted to cry tears of pain,1,19 November 2010,"I grew up loving Terminator. Especially the second movie. And this movie completely sucks in almost every way.I keep trying to find something redeeming about it. I'm trying to force myself with mental back-flips into somehow making this movie not the worst film I had ever seen. The only thing good this film did was judgment day. But, that would have served better as a two or three minute prologue to T4 and T4 could have been T3 and things would be much better.(Judgment day was pro-longed but not stopped, now to the movie.) The movie tries to be funny, and falls on its face by taking treasured scenes and turning them into half-baked and crappy jokes. It tries to change storyline, in all the wrong ways. Everything feels forced. You almost wish that Arnold will stop talking because everything he says just destroys any sense the previous two movies every made. (Not that they were perfect; but T3 took 'creative liberties' to an obscene level where they were pulling crap out of their butt left and right and not even checking if it had any dramatic reason to be there, make fans happy, or even make any sense.) The took my child-hood hero that was emotionally strong and turned him into a whiny a** drug addict. I grew up watching T2 and playing with T2 toys sense I was about five. As I got older, I saw John as a role model of emotional maturity; someone with strong leadership skills that I would someday want to be.Now he's a whiny little b**ch for some reason that has never really been explained. He never was before. Had no reason for becoming. It's not like he was unstable and this was in the cards. Of all the characters in T2, T1 even, he was the most emotionally mature and most level headed; even talking his mom down from killing a man.Now? Now he'd go pop some dog neutering pills and be out for hours. Wow, did the writer have nothing better to do than defecate on my childhood? The Terminator series has always been about making your own fate, your own future. That's how things really work. That is a large part of Spirituality. The movie itself even shows that the future was changed. Skynet was set back, that itself is a change. So why does the film go on and on trying to refute how things really Spiritually work, how they worked in T1, how they worked in T2, and how they work even in this film. It just seems that John was just such a whiny runt that he gave up on saving the future.I almost wanted the Arnold Terminator to shoot John dead in the movie so he would just stop whining so damn much. Boo hoo, the future, boo hoo, his life sucks, boo hoo. How did John go from emotionally stable leader to emo drug addict thumb sucker? This film felt like those making it took personal pleasure in taking everything the first two films had ever done well, and every way positive they touched my life, and just shredded it.Part 4 does a great job it trying to put a coherent story back together after 3. I like Part 4, actually. At least it understood what it was supposed to be. But it had two classics to stand up to and a lot of baggage from 3 to deal with. So, I think Part 4 did the best it could considering and I like Part 4 a lot.As for Part 3, it was just sad.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
953,RustyShackleworth,"Wow! Much better than I expected, good film!",9,3 July 2003,"I went to see T3 with moderate expectations but halfway through the film I found myself really impressed with the third Terminator film.As expected, T3 has lots of action but much of it is done well in conveying the story.  There is an especially intense vehicle chase and it's been a while since I've watch one on film that didn't bore me to some extent. I've read some reviews that complained that T3 didn't show off a lot of special effects and seemed-scaled back.  This is not the case of all.  One of the good things about T3 is that it doesn't bombard you with lots of CGI and other effects.  And some of the effects here are quite impressive.T3 also has quite a bit of humor especially in the first half of the film. I wasn't expecting this as much but it was fun and it did a good job of balancing against action.The ending of the film is perhaps the best asset.  It stays true to the first Terminator film and leaves you thinking about dangers technology going amok and the value of life.T3 is more a enjoyable action, sci-fi film than the Matrix Reloaded and in many ways better than T2.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
954,Henesy484,fun!,10,7 July 2003,I didn't know what to expect when I went to see this movie and I ended up seeing it again because I liked it so much. I am a huge fan of the first two and this one was just as good and fun to watch. Especially the kick ass car chase scene (personally my favorite part of the movie). All in all it was a great film.,Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
955,paygeness,Sci-Fi Must See Movie,9,14 July 2003,"""What ever you want to see honey,"" is what I told my husband.  I had no clue that Cameron was not majorly involved in this movie.  I knew that Furlong was not going to be on the screen and hated that.  I whispered to hubby before the movie, you know if they do a T4, I don't care of Arnold is in next one.  That is how low my expectations were for this film.I left the movie going WOW!!!  I loved the action.  Some action came so fast and so furious that this non computerized brain could not process what it had just seen.  Alot of action was hard hitting.One reviewer stated Dane's character was not very credable especially when she locked up John Conner and did not go running for help.   I would like to think that this character had some backbone and was a strong person, knowing that she knew him, felt that there was no need to panic, yet.  And in the long run that is who she needed to be.Other reviews I have read say there is no story line.  I saw that TX (the latest model of terminator) was intent on its mission  (ITS - non gender its not human)  Like a machine with specific tasks TX took the straightest possible route from point A and point B.One person commented on how they did not like that TX said ""I like your gun"" while other Terminator models made same comments on objects they were about to take.  I assumed that this was the film makers way of telling us how the TX was going remove the cop from its path.As for Furlong not being in the movie, by the end of the movie I felt that the new actor represented John Conner the adult, the scared face warrior of the future.I loved seeing the Dr from T2.  I thought it was a nice sentimental touch. (Maybe Cameron-esque)Lastly,  The T100 unit (Arnold) was not portrayed as compassionate (for those who have not seen T2 on DVD - there is footage that shows changes made to the terminator allowing him to learn gain a bit of humanity)  This was not the same machine from the previous movies and I liked the reinforcement of that fact.While this movie may have disappointed some, I found it completed a circle between the three films and if this is the last of the Terminator movies I think it was well done.And as Dennis Miller use to say... Thats my opinion.. I could be wrong.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

957,Hoog,"The original crew dropped out, this is what happened",1,2 July 2003,"Being that there are so many points in Terminator 3:Rise of the Machines which could make you realize its a bad movie, its hard to determine the first one that really makes you give up all hope for the remaining hours. I'll help you because its really quite obvious; When Arnold pulls out shades from his leather jacket, puts them and realizes that (Ha Ha!) there star shaped!! Then he smirks and crunches them. If he had left them on you really wouldn't have noticed because the rest of the movie is spent with the bad-ass T-1000 cracking inside joke one-liners about how ""robotic"" he is. In an attempt to top T2000 (from T2), they decided that the cool metal skeleton robot could be covered by the really cool liquid metal to form the coolest robot ever! Obviously they realized how stupid that was and just decided to make it a hot chick who can do, literally, anything. You know where this is going because they recycled it from the second movie. John Connors must be saved blah blah blah. The few writing elements which are new to T3 are old to anyone who's seen a movie before.Even though Arnold has way too many lines for a killing machine, he still plays a great robot. Its easy to pick apart actors who play robots but this was always his best role and he does it better than anyone else. When she wasnt the butt of a joke or timing out the perfect punchline, Clair Danes delivers the only other believable performance in T3. I guess she slipped through the cracks because Nick Stahl and Krisstana Loken text book ""acted"" there way through the entire movie draining life out of the already decaying script. If you could orchestrate the perfect bad movie scene by scene you would inevitabley produce T3. It was exciting to watch. Each scene that went by I grew more and more excited to see how they could possibly make this movie any worse. Amazingly, through bad direction weak acting and horrendous writing, they did it!

960,AlexTheRamL,Just a big disappointment,3,29 January 2011,"I'm going to admit director Jonathan Mostow had some balls to make this, your making another entry in the Terminator series, two of the greatest films of all time! Many people call this an astonishing summer action flick, but to me a hardcore Terminator fan this is just a big middle finger insult. The plot is it's 20 years later John Connor is moving across the world so that no more Terminators an find him. BUT! They do find him the T-800 (Schwarzenegger of course) and The T-X then it's basically the same plot as Judgment Day. James Cameron tied a knot so hard at the ending of Terminator 2 that they had to cheat the source material in this one Judgment day is not preventable and so the T-800 has to get them to a safe zone. You know for the T-X to be the newest unit it's really no where as advance as the T-1000 in the second one. The T-X might be more flexible and can still morph into people but the T-1000 can do that also he can form knives and stabbing objects to which to me is pretty badass. Nick Stahl is the new John Connor. I don't like him as John Connor at all. For one thing I thought John Connor would be this complete bad ass of a kid when he gets older, but he just seems like some wimp, plus his foul mouth language is gone, his advice to The T-800 well I don't remember him giving anything remember able to him. I mean Edward Furlong created the personality for John Connor and there was deep character development, for me Nick Stahl didn't really give me any personality for the older John Connor, I didn't feel like I knew John Connor at all, unless John was just suppose to grow up awkwardly, sure he seems less annoying then Edward Furlong but he just doesn't fit as the older John Connor, though I will admit I thought he was better than Christen Bale is Salvation. I'm glad Schwarzenegger did The T-800 again; if he did not choose to do it again then I would have never wanted to be made. He still doing what he does best, playing a badass machine, but his character kind of takes a step down because there is no character change. In the second one he went from a machine doing his mission into a father like figure for John. In this one he's just doing the mission. But he is still humorous and still fun to watch which is still good for me, but I was disappointed he didn't say ""I'll be back"", but with out a doubt he is the best part of the movie. There is also a new character; Claire Danes plays Kate Brewster essentially going to be John's husband in the future. Honestly I just thought she was awful. The T-X killed her husband and morphed into him. When they find each other the T-X morph back into itself, the expression on her face isn't what I expected, it looks like she saw a ghost, plus I thought she was just super annoying and I never felt she was actually scared plus she never really created a personality and the one thing she a John had in common is that they went to the same high school together and the more they spent time together I never felt they could ever get along with each other. I never saw a relationship for them. When I first rated this I gave it a 0% but I felt like I was being too harsh. To me the biggest flaw was the acting. The Claire didn't give her character a personality and Nick did awful as John Connor. In the first one everyone had a personality even Miles did and it made the movie incredibly suspenseful, you want them to stop Judgment day. In here there was no suspense and I honestly didn't care if the made it or not. Also I didn't like how it's basically the same plot as Terminator 2. They made me think that they didn't care about anything except the action in this. Now The Terminator is known to have great and I mean great action sequences make that many great action sequences. In this one for me the very best action sequence is the one where the terminator is hanging from the crane, I thought that was completely bad ass, also the part where the Terminator is carrying John in the coffin I thought that was pretty original. The other action sequences to me were just boring and didn't live up to the hype that I expected. Back then I had a lot of complaints about the action but today I just realize it was just nick-picking (if I said that right). Director Ang Lee was actually offered to direct this but he turned it down to direct the Hulk film, I'm not sure how it would've turned out if he directed this, he probably would have done a better job with the action sequences, well considering what he did to The Hulk maybe, but he is still a better director than Jonathan Mostow. Besides from Schwarzenegger still being a delight to watch and a few memorable action scenes Terminator 3 disappointed me with a lazy script, bad acting, many bland action scenes and awful character development. With being a hardcore Terminator fan if they called this anything else but Terminator 3 Rise of the Machines, I might have liked it more, otherwise I think the world would have been better without this.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
961,Taizong,Not as good as it's predeccesors,8,20 July 2003,"T3 wasn't an awful movie by any definition of the word, but it wasn't great either. As a stand alone action film it was very good. The action was frenzied and satisfying, and the special effects tremendous. Were it to exist without the compelling lore that T1 and T2 built before it, though, it would be merely average.The TX (the female terminator) was uninspired and boring, and was never alarmingly dangerous as the previous two villians were. She simply didn't scare you, she never seemed unstoppable - which is what the movies were always about when it came to the bad guy: a relentless killing machine that simply can not be stopped, that will never stop, until you are DEAD! Sorry, she wasn't that great. She didn't even look all that great - pretty average looking for a leading female in today's film. And we all know that she was picked to entice young males.....One great highlight of the film was the humor. This movie really made me laugh out loud a few times (as it did the entire audience). Arnold was as good as he ever was, and really looked great for an old guy. You can tell that he loved making this movie.In the end, the plot was as solid as it could be, considering that almost everyone knew what was going to end up happening. The action was killer, as was the special effects. But, it didn't live up to it's mythos. The Terminator is supposed to shock and scare you; the Terminator is suppose to intimidate the audience. The TX did anything but.....8 out of 10 - I would give it a 7 (maybe even a 6), but I realize that it's just an action flick, and you can't expect the world when it comes to that genre. Besides, it's an Arnold movie, and Arnold is the man!",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
962,bdmcwill,Good excuse to destroy vehicles - Average movie,4,3 July 2003,The crane scene in this movie makes it worthwhile.  I think they tried too hard to compete with the Matrix and failed.  Either that or I am now expecting a good story to go with special effects and it just didn't happen. They also seemed to be trying too hard to set up T4 - I'd probably skip it based on this one.,Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
963,urashimatarou,A Hero in the making,8,2 July 2003,"T3: Rise of the Machines is the 3rd installment of the Terminator series. Though many critics may claim that the absence of director James Cameron may have influenced the style and feel of the movie, I beg to differ, and must add that Jonathon Mostow has done a great job at elevating the depth of the Terminator series fanthom more. Of all the features that this movie displays, its main appeal comes from its level of realism, which adds to its worth in our everyday lives and its influence on various choices and applications that mankind drives to make. The cast is mint, fresh off the shelf (with the exception of Arnold, and on a lighter note, a comic relief Earl Boen, aka. Dr. I'm not Crazy but I am going Crazy). Nick Stahl does an excellent job at fitting the role of John Connor, as he is an highly undescisive character that is not obviously determined to save the world, nor denies his existence, but rather, lives to see himself evolve into the leader of the resistence. Clares Daine does a pretty good job at playing newly introduced and old time childhood friend Brewster, but nothing worth noting.  Arnold? Heck, this guy is unstoppable, since he is essentially, body, mind and soul, the living version of Terminator itself. Unfortunately, Loken, falls a bit short in giving the audience that thriller look. Certainly, she is sexy, sleek and even a bit quirky, but I don't think it was really her fault for her lack of thrillism (invented word), but the castings' fault. All in all, she does give it her best. The first half hour of T3 is sort of an introduction of what John Connor has become since the last installment. John Connor, trying to protect mankind, hides himself from society and becomes a ghost to the world. Not quite, as KAZAAM, TX appears in her little magic ball, etc. etc.. etc... From here on, there is nothing but pure heart-pounding action, and perhaps the greatest scene was the massive 6 car/truck chase b/w TX, T Model 101, Connor and Brewster. The effects in this movie puts Matrix and its successors to shame. It just goes to show that to make something look real, it ought to be real. Anyhow, that's my 2 cents. I give this installment 4/5 stars (relative to 4/5 stars for T2 and 4.5/5 stars for T1).",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
964,Paperboy3000,Out of this world special effects,8,8 July 2003,"I just have to say, if you are a fan of action movies, go and see this one. It's a step above almost all ""heavy action"" movies I've seen in awhile. I would highly recommend going and seeing this at the theater to experience it to its max.As far as the story goes, I think it's pretty hard to come up with a great story/script with 2 already great films preceding it.I think they did a great job and will highly recommend this to all action seekers. Go to a theater with THX certification and listen to the sound system get a serious workout.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
965,frequentlyrandom,"To use the played out saying, it was an ""action-packed movie""",7,13 July 2003,"Though the movie was entertaining, full of humorous quips by Arnold, and lots of explosions and action, it still lacked the same suspense that was present in the first two films.  The action was great, and if you look at the trivia, there was one scene they were going to cut because of cost and running behind budget, but Arnold lowered his price tag by a million so they could do the shot.  It was well worth the million.  Overall, if you've seen the first two, don't expect the same ratios of action and dialogue, but it is still a good movie, and well worth the matinee price I paid for it ;-).",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
966,Sunnikka,A bunch of effects,8,18 July 2003,"Again we see Arnold as a good guy in Terminator 3, which has too damn much of ""great effects"".

967,mikenickky,No where near as good as the first two movies.,5,22 July 2003,"This is one unnecessary sequel to two science fiction classics. Sure, everyone wanted  a another Terminator movie, but they should have giving us more than this. James Cameron is no where in sight in this follow up, and is replace with Jonathan Mostow, whose films Breakdown and 'U-571'were tepid at best. Arnold Schwarzenegger is back as The Terminator who returns to protect an adult John Conner from an advance model-killing machine called the T-X played by Kristanna Loken. Every thing that was set up before in Terminator 2 is throng out for the sake of another sequel, and the story is not only incoherent but also down right annoying in certain parts of the film.  The T-X is not as advance as the T-1000 from Terminator 2, and not as menacing. You were actually scared of The T-1000, and it gave you a reason to be scared by the way that it could kill at will. The T-X is just poor carbon copy of the T-1000, and not as efficient of a killing machine. The story should have been better and should have been a great continuation of the second movie but in it's journey to be different, it forgot what it should have been.  Sure, it's a great time waster but compared to the others, it's a disappointment. The movie was made to capitalize and two much better films and judging by the way the movie ends, they are going to rape those films even further.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
968,coachD,I actually wanted more of a story,7,8 August 2003,"Just to let you know, I am a die-hard Terminator fan.  Have been ever since the 1st movie.  I collect the comics and have read all the T2 books by S. M. Stirling (like T2: Infiltrator).  I actually wanted more a story than I got in T3.  There is no doubt T3 is a great action movie, and who doesn't love the female Terminator?  But I guess I did miss the Sara Connor character. In T3, John Connor came across as too much of a wimpy cry baby.  The Sara Connor from T2 would have continued to train John on how to survive ""Judgment Day"".  Overall I was a little disappointed in T3.  To me it was too short (barely 100 minutes), I wanted a more developed story line (like what was happening in the future and that sort of stuff), and I wanted Linda Hamilton back.  I will end up buying the T3 DVD when it comes out, and I can only hope they make a T4, so we can see how the war against the machines really ends.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
969,Patrickmi777,The Best Movie Of 2003 And By A Land Slide,9,27 July 2003,"After all the garbage I've seen this summer (The Matrix Reloaded, Hulk, and X-Men 2), I was glad to finally see a good movie (Terminator 3). Not only was Terminator 3 good, it was one of the best movies I've ever seen. The story was great, the Terminatrix was awesome (better then the T-100), the action was intense, the ending was perfect, and Arnold was funny as hell.Terminator 3 is by far the best movie of 2003 and it will still be the best movie of 2003 when the year is over. Even Return Of The King won't beat it and Return Of The King is sure to be one of the best movies ever made.There was one thing missing from Terminator 3 and that was the Terminator music. It was played during the end credits but who know why they left it out during the entire movie. If Terminator 3 has the Terminator music, I would actually say that Terminator 3 was perfect. Getting over this minor fault, Terminator 3 easily made it on to my top 10 movies of all time list. This is saying a lot since 8 out of the other 9 of them are from the 80's or earlier.As much as I love Terminator 3, Terminator 2 is slightly better. Terminator 2 makes it one place higher then Terminator 3 on my top 10 movies of all time list. This is due to it being a longer movie and having the Terminator music played quite a few time through out it. Neither one of these things is a big deal but it helped me decide which movie I liked better.
If you haven't seen Terminator 3 already then do yourself a favor and see it right away. If you have seen Terminator 3 and didn't like it then see it again because you obviously missed something.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
970,blondieboy,Enjoyable for the wrong reasons,8,1 August 2003,"(Spoilers ahead)Anyone expecting this film to build on the T1 and T2 legacy (I was) will be disappointed. However, the film as its own entity is one of the best action films released in a long time.Looking back, it seems inevitable that T3 should go this route. In T1 we had genuine fear and desperation as the ""unstoppable"" terminator stalked its prey. In this respect T2 sold out the original for the sake of a good action film packed full of special effects. Admittedly T2 had a good plot including addressing the destiny/fate dilemma and the hope/despair of mankind's future. So where then will T3 go? Risk going back to the gritty original and alienate all the T2 fans? I think not.T3 moves forward into the action genre. Big fights, fancy weapons, glittering effects - none of these disappoint. The plot gets too caught up in the ""it's your destiny"" loop and doesn't really explore any of the time dilemmas. The ending is inevitable but leads us nicely on to T4.So, given the drawbacks mentioned above, did I like the film? The answer is a resounding ""yes"". Once I realised that this film should be treated as a *Terminator Action Franchise* I sat back and lapped it up. On leaving the cinema and felt contented that I had been well entertained for 2 hours.I must take a paragraph to talk about the humour in this film. This IS a funny film. While not normally a fan of dumb humour, I did laugh out loud at several points. The dead-pan deliver given by Arnie is excellent and well-timed and fitted well with the feel of the movie.In summary, you must watch this film if you like action movies with interesting storylines. It's entertainment without being an over-the-top action flick a la John Woo. Throughly enjoyable and recommended. 8/10.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
971,derbling,an insult to the original,1,3 July 2005,"Action movies usually don't manage to develop a deep and interesting storyline. And most of them don't even want to. That is fine, since there are a lot of people who like to watch an easy entertaining movie once in a while.""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" proved that action movies can be so much more. Sometimes it would seem to you that incredible special effects don't let any financial room for a script (see ""Waterworld""), but T2 had it all: Awesome directing, award-winning special effects, a very becoming soundtrack, actors who did an incredible job (Linda especially) and a story that made it my all time favorite.That is why Terminator 3 fails. The team might have produced a decent action movie a la ""Predator"", but in this case, they hit a whole franchise right in the face. The soundtrack is boring, the movie goes against principles that the first two laid out, the Terminator acts ridiculous, the pictures are nothing compared to the most of the time impressive and artistic scenes from T2.Makes one wonder.. why was this movie even made? The ONLY reason is profit. I know that the goal of every movie is to make money, but if you can feel that there's no love for the project involved, it's crap. There are people who say it is not fair to compare T3 to T2, but what else would you do with a direct sequel?",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

But, trusting the 7.2 vote it recieved from IMDB, we chanced it--and thank God we did. This has got to be the best action movie I've seen in years. We loved it. Some other friends said that there was a more humorous side to it, so I went into the movie expecting a hammed up version of its predessosor; however, the ""comedic"" scenes just added to the entertainment of the movie, they did not detract from it's seriousness that the end of the earth as we know is near. The ending was fantastic and added more intrigue to the idea that machines will rule the earth and fight mankind for its rule. Moreover, the ending left you with a feeling similar to reading The Stand, or War of the Worlds. A great movie that's worth full price. Bravo! Arnold.

There wasn't a lot of background for those who haven't seen the previous two, but if you have, you don't need it.  This movie plays up to all the camp developed in the previous two movies and does it quite well.  There are lines that might seem predictable but they are still very funny when delivered, as well as a few new destined-to-be-classics.

974,caramelos,The T-X,10,6 September 2003,"I think one of the best things about about T3 was Kristanna Loken, even if she did have less lines and things to do than the other evil terminators, she still did very very well with what she was given. Personally I think she did a great job. If they make a T4 I hope she is in it but with a bigger role. I also thought that Nick Stahl was quite good. He seemed to come across as quite vunerable though which I wasn't expecting and after a few years on the run you'd think he'd be a little less naive (for lack of a better word). All in all I really loved this movie, I saw it twice in the cinema and would go again if I could. I can't wait for the DVD, I'd like to see some deleted scenes... maybe there were a lot of ones that Kristanna had that were deleted which would explain why she wasn't as scary as the other evil ones. Actually because she had less to do I felt her character more as a ""human"" than a terminator. She really did try to get her missions done and she did manage to kill the other leaders so she wasn't all bad. And for someone who hasn't done any major body training in a while, Arnie toned up pretty good, but if they get around to making a fourth film... if the timing is going the same way it has been (one a decade) hes going to be more than 65 years old by the time they make it! Claire Danes could have had more of a role... and I really want to know, in the trailer, what's the name of the music right before the end? I think it's the third piece of music to be played (when Kristanna is programming the robot) because I like that piece of music very much.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

Best movie of the year (2003) for me so far because it leaves you with little to think about after it's done.

Jonathan Mostow just sucked the life of this film, cause James Cameron made the 2 other movies into a humanistic type of movie. This film typically destroyed the Terminator franchise all because of the poor directing and the characters are just freaking stubborn.As well as they did not need to make the third one, since the 2nd movie stopped judgement day. The ups of this film is that Arnie is back for good. Like all the other Terminator blockbusters this had romping action. Unfortunately, in every scene it dies down and goes to useless talk about Brewster and Connor. I do feel bad about this film since it already had the quality of an action blockbuster. Unless it was part of a trio of movies. Still entertaining, but nonetheless poor acting and extremely non- Terminator filming makes this movie a 5/10 in my vote.

978,happiness-grace,The Drop-Off Was Inevitable,7,1 April 2012,"As a big fan of the Terminator movies, 1 and 2 were superb! Unfortunately, T3 suffers from the ""Hollywood blockbuster"" syndrome, the need to out perform and surpass its predecessors with bigger, bolder, more blast-worthy action. Chases and nitroglycerine abound in this film as characterization is pushed to the background.To be fair, very little characterization is needed except for the Claire Danes character. Unless you've been living in an isolated commune for the past 20 years, you know the Terminator. Arnold's persona has become pop culture myth -- like the Six Million Dollar Man writ large. Stahl's character, John Connor, is still the ordinary man tormented by his awesome destiny.T3 does deliver the stunts, the explosions, even the catchy one-liners to which we've become accustomed. Arnold's performance is stellar. His charm breathes humanity into an automaton (Gov. Schwarzenegger one day perhaps?). Stahl is competent, while Danes is immeasurably underused. Note her role as Juliet in Baz Luhrman's Romeo and Juliet -- but hey, this isn't Henry James. Kristanna Loken is good as well, sexily exuding VERY homicidal tendencies.I agree with Roger Ebert in saying that T3 is really a dumbed down version of its history.

I also hated how they didn't explain Skynet spawning when the end of T2 changes the fate of the machines taking over. It's weird how Edward Furlong played a better Connor than this shi**y-ass actor did. All I can say is that Arnold's return as the T-101 is the only thing i enjoyed about this garbage.

981,buffalo_alice_lm,Let's pretend it didn't happen,6,16 January 2007,"We could almost unanimously agree that Terminator 2: Judgment Day is one of the best action movies ever made. Having established that, I understand that Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines had a high standard to live up to, so it should have been no surprise if it didn't quite reach the level of its predecessor. I've watched T3 twice now, which tells you that it's not entirely the disappointment that sequels often turn out to be. The action sequences definitely rival those of the other movies in the series, and in fact surpass those of many other action flicks, which is made possible by the fact that the characters in the high-speed chase with multiple crashes and explosions are not human and thus can survive any crash. Kristanna Loken is HOT as the Terminatrix. The movie dishes out the characteristic ironies of time travel and glimpses into the future, although none quite as powerful as the revelation in T2 that the Terminator crushed by Sarah Connor in Part 1 became the prototype for the machines that would eventually terrorize humans. It is interesting to see John Connor grown up, living with the paranoia that comes from his experience with the Terminator, and his feelings about his destiny as the leader of the human race. He is not quite the adult John that I pictured after seeing the trash-talking, street-savvy teenager in T2, but I can accept that people may change, especially after a traumatic experience of nearly being killed by a machine. The movie does not forget the more memorable moments of those which came before it, including a variation of ""Come with me if you want to live,"" and the recurring character of Dr. Silberman, although Arnie's delivery of ""I'm back"" makes me cringe and think that sticking with the good ol' ""I'll be back"" might have been less cheesy.All in all, it is a good, though not great, movie as long as the viewer remembers that sequels rarely live up to the ones before it, and yet...this film leaves me with a disturbing, unsettling feeling that it should never have happened. It feels like an afterthought, which we all know it wasone last blockbuster in a fading acting career, one last attempt to make some money on the phenomenal franchise. More than that knowledge of Hollywood, however, I feel troubled as a fan of the first two movies and of Sarah Connor. While I understand that Sarah is only a fictional character, this movie seems an insult to her memory. The fact that the Terminators still exist, are still trying to kill her son and take over the world, makes Sarah seem that much more tragic. After watching her nightmares in T2 which portrayed nuclear explosions with horrifying realism, and cheering her on while she overcame the impossible, I cannot stomach the thought that the machines still come into existence and try to take over. It makes me glad that ""Sarah Connor"" did not live to see this film.In summary...it's a decent movie and worth a couple viewings, but when you go back and watch T2 again, just pretend that T3 never happened.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

I'm sure everyone got paid well and there's food on the table, that's great, but if the movie industry ever wondered why people pirate movies its so that we don't feel so ripped off when we shell out 15$ for a mistake. The most entertaining part of the movie was counting the explosions with my cousin, cause then we came up with explosion subcategories.

Although her character was made to be ""tougher"" than the Terminator it still makes you laugh. I see this as a serious movie not one where you crack some jokes - not at least at the Terminator's expense.On a positive note this may set up a base for T4 and hopefully someone may bring it back to level we know it as.......The movie is enjoyable but for me, not as 1 and 2.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
985,paul-bevan,where's the emotion?,3,17 October 2006,"lacks any of the moody atmosphere of the first two movies. The director was just going through the motions. The guy who played John Connor was terrible. The characters lacked any depth at all. The idea of having a female terminator was just too gimmicky. Too many plot holes, out and out rip offs from the first two films and lack of originality makes me wonder what Arnie was thinking, reprising his role for this joke of a film. This film seems to have focused more on generating revenue than completing a classic film trilogy. There is a complete lack of substance and will only appeal to the lowest common denominator. Those who can't see past the one liners will probably enjoy it. Fans of the first two films who enjoyed the story as a whole and the world in which it took place will be aghast at the rather lame attempt at making a good film.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
986,nek-5,Brilliant! funniest film in ages!!,1,18 May 2008,"This film is a complete tour de force of wacky, out-there and not least of all CHILDISH comedy! from the very first appearance of the iconic and much-beloved action character wearing FRUITY ELTON JOHN SHADES BY MISTAKE!! to the hilarious (and dated!) ""talk to the hand"" gags, this film's script and execution is chock-a-block full of gut-busting cracks the whole family can enjoy! eschewing the boring old action hero role of both preceding classic movies, nearly every line uttered by comedic mastermind Arnold Schwarzenegger as ""the terminator comedy funbot"" had the entire theater literally GROANING with laughter. I can only hope that the next entry in this series finally gets rid of all the LAME action sequences that unfortunately got in the way of the gags in this one. I think that dave chappelle, andy dick and paulie shore would be EXCELLENT choices for different terminator models!!!

987,dneal,"Pure Action, Without Any Drive, Spirit or Thought Required",6,7 July 2003,"I've seen it twice now and have been doing a lot of thinking about what I've observed. I've been trying to figure out what they've done to one of my favorite movie series of all time.T1 was a Sci-Fi thriller with some action thrown in. It was about thought. They couldn't throw out hours of CGI action back in these days. It was up to your imagination to fill in the gaps. It left you wondering just what you were seeing and what was happening. Cameron didn't go out of his way to explain everything or to have explosions everywhere. It was about shadows, symbolism, and dreaming. It was awesome.T2 was the action side of T1 but still with a razor sharp plot that left the viewer thinking hard about what he was seeing. It dealt with issues of humanity and the thought that our lives are not predetermined to work out a certain way. T2, as was T1, was a finely sculpted movie. The only improvement could have been leaving all the DVD's added footage in the theatrical release.T3 is a new and very different monster. Cameron is gone, replaced by Mostow. Mostow created a movie with a different goal, and a very different feeling. The emphasis was plainly on the action with storyline and character development taking a backseat. There weren't really any major flaws with the small amount of story there was, and I liked how it continued T2's ""fate is what we make"" theme. But, this move just lacks the character and energy of Cameron's Terminator works.For one, the humor was far too excessive. T-800s don't crack jokes. The ONLY reason Arnold did in T2 was because John taught them to him after they switched Arnold's chip to learn mode. A T-800 is a walking AI designed to efficiently and ruthlessly kill. They don't go out of their way to be funny. The worst part of the humor was most certainly the fact that it downplayed the seriousness of the film. The world is about to end, T-800s and T-Xs are trashing citys and gruesomely murdering people. Intertwining humor with this is ridiculous. They seemed to go out of their way to destroy the atmosphere of the movie.One MAJOR peeve for me was the lack of a quality soundtrack. Music is a major part of this series, and a soundtrack easily makes or breaks a movie for me. Brad Fiedel's score for T1 and T2 are indisputably legendary and are easily 50% of what made the movies so great. They had an edge to them that fit with the whole evil machine theme, and created a simply stunning sonic atmosphere. His use of industrial sounds to create a moving, percussion-based sound was just incredibly creative.This new Marco Beltrami fellow decided to take the Terminator his own direction. Too bad his direction is a muddy, unemotional mess. Perhaps he is a T-800, his music inspired the same level of emotion in me as the T-800 displays. Watching the city-block smashing scene without any influential background music was just completely illusion-breaking and dumbfounding. The theme for the T-X was uninspired and very weak. Arnold's hammer-banging heavy industrial theme from T2 was replaced with nothing as far as I could tell. The poor score made the movie feel like a halfway effort. The music lacked heart, and thus so did the visuals.After seeing it a second time I've become sort of less critical, however. A sequel means changes, and I realize that. The new director did a decent job maintaining consistency with the Terminator plotline. He just couldn't knit together the atmosphere, story, emotion, and action that made the older two flicks such total classics.A special message for Mostow: Bring back Brad Fiedel to score T4.

Other problems:  Why not send back terminators to just search for John Connors--even if they don't know where he is now?

This third movie was spattered with one-liners referring back to the previous two - it made a comedy of it. The acting and effects however were excellent and I thought the movie was well presented.

There might be a couple of gaps in the story. And the effects in few scenes might make you go ""Ok, this is CGI, and not even good one"". But... T3 was a movie, that made me go ""whoa, back up, take a break"". The action started from the moment the movie started, and stopped about 5 minutes before the end credits, and the movie gave the watchers ample opportunity to go ""ok, let me figure out this part of Terminator story/history, before you give it away in a few minutes"".It might not be the best script, nor the best acting (by a long shot, Mr. Governor), but it sure as he is one hell of a rollercoaster ride of action and explosions.

But when I heard that James Cameron was dropping out, and that John Connor wouldn't be played by Edward Furlong I was a little disapointed, but still excited. However, I was right to be disapointed. Terminator 3 is a good movie in general, but compared to the first two movies, it's crap. There are some OK moments, most movies have them, and even I thought the beginning part with the sunglasses was funny, but the movies aren't made to be funny. They aren't made to mock the first two. The only thing I really liked *****SPOILER***** was seeing the psychiatrist (Dr. Peter Silberman) from the first two films. The ending was also very depressing.

I really enjoyed the second film, a wonderful apocalyptic action-packed film shot on a huge budget (once again a tight script). I hated the third film because it was and action-packed film but not much else...besides the big budget of course. Eventually the car chases just become more of ""been there, done that.""How many times can you watch cyborgs throw one another into a wall (just like in the second film)?How many times can you watch the a big rig chasing our heroes down the street (just like the first and second)?The only difference with this film over the others is that in this one the terminators attack one another with every form of plumbing fixture known to man.During a pivotal scene, John Connor, our hero, threatens to shoot himself in the head unless the Arnold terminator does what John asks. I was praying that John would have pulled the trigger just so that I would be able to leave the theater that much sooner.Save yourself the money you would waste on this one and go rent the first two in this series.

1002,art_inme82,"A good, solid, film; however, the lack of Cameron diminishes it's overall effect.",7,2 July 2003,"The original ""Terminator"" was an amazing film for 1984, the action was unprecedented, the visuals phenomenal, and the human drama a welcome surprise. In 1991 James Cameron shocked audiences by making T2 better than the original in almost every area; creating one of the greatest films of all time. T3: Rise Of The Machines is a really good film; however, the lack of Cameron's directing is felt throughout the entire film, greatly diminishing its overall effect. For instance, the acting sequences in this one are more confusing than the one's in T2; gone are the days of the T-1000(in a Semi) chasing the young John Conner(on a dirt-bike) while Arnold(on a Harley) pursues both of them. Cameron has a way of making audiences completely understand an action sequence, Jonathan Mostow still has a lot to learn.As T3 begins we don't get any of the classic Terminator music that was present in the last 2 films, instead we get eary music which is very quickly followed by the film's title, ""Terminator 3: Rise Of The Machines;"" which of course is then followed by Arnold's full name, reminding all of us that while James Cameron and Linda Hamilton may be missing, we all came to see Arnold kick some ass. The film has a hard time, at first, making us feel pity or any other form of compassion for, the older and more mature, John Conner. Thankfully by the time John explains to us how his mother, Sarah Conner, died of cancer we've actually grown to like John. Soon after the introduction of John, we meet the new terminator: a Terminatrix, played farely well by newcomer Kristinna Lokken. The TX is an improvement over the T-1000, she can form weapons with her liqued metal skin and she can also infiltrate and control other machines; however, despite all of her advancements she doesn't quite make us shuddder in fear like the original T-101 or T-1000. After all of the new characters have been introduced the movie descends into one action scene after another, while all are good, we still feel like we're covering old ground. Thankfully, just when you think the new Terminator is a little soft, she graphically impales a detective with her arm and then procedes to drive the car from the back seat: With Her ""ARM"" still sticking through his chest! Yes, it was a very disturbing scene. Despite all of the new action sequences, I really enjoyed listening the John Conner's little lectures about the future, fate, machines and his own destiny. They didn't feel ""canned"" in the least, I was very impressed.By the end of T3, I realised two very important things: (1) I actually care about what happens to John Conner and (2) The storyline of T2 has become ""almost"" completely obsolete; I may be the only one who feels this way, but the 3rd film in a trilogy is supposed to build upon the plot in the ""middle"" movie, not refute it. So there you have it, T3 is a new kind of Terminator movie; it doesn't improve upon the second film, but it presents a new face that's different enough to make the film very entertaining.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

Now there I said it...It's hard though, to judge a movie these days as you become older and older cause the first time impressions will never become the same as when you saw like The Terminator as a 10 year old boy back in 1984. Still from time to time a movie comes along that simply grabs you by the ba...(well they are fragile) within 10 minutes and don't let go till you've tormented your wallet with half a dusin repeat viewings, which will be the case for me with this movie, once it's officially released. The last time I experienced this was in ´98 when The Matrix was out (something that sadly wasn't repeated with ""Reloaded"").Terminator 3 is simply AMAZING IMO. It is fast paced, in your face high definition action wrapped around a tight storyline with some very fulfilling revelations, but as an action piece, this baby comes close to being orgasmic!Now though I may sound like it, I'm no Arnold/Terminator fanboy, but I AM an actionjunkie, a true sucker for clever action epics.This movie took me by total surprise and that may be the explanation as to why I seem so positive. I really didn't expect much from this movie judging by the trailers. Not even the last trailer was particular good IMO, but let me tell you this is one of the rare times when a trailer truly didn't reveal anything from the movie. T3 is SOO MUCH bigger than what the trailer makes it appear.I loved T2, it's one of my fav sci-fi movies, but T3 is just better! At NO point does this movie drag and though it does rehash most of the scenes from T2 it makes sure to nudge these scenes up like 50-100%, but at the same time it introduces a lot of new and fresh jaw-droppers. This movie will leave scars on the furniture of the theaters from all the nails that will dig into the seats.To you skeptics out there, and I now there are plenty, FORGET YOUR WORRIES and go see this thing, cause NO ONE can claim to NOT be entertained by T3.Isn't there anything negative? Well there was a corny cameo from T2 that I didn't like and I was certain I would hear the famous Brad Fiedel theme playing to the credits which it didn't (we got some remixed version in the end though).

T3 definitly takes a step up from T2 and T1 in the special effects department. Some of the special effects were absolutely breathtaking. The TX (Lokken)was brilliant as she acted so much like a machine i almost thought that she was! she has very few lines so for most of the movie, she uses facial expressions. She is also very...evil. within the first 20 minutes of the movie she kills quite a few people. Arnold comes back strong as the somewhat primitive Terminator Model-101. Again, like T2 he is greatly at the disadvantage. I think Arnold played the terminator better in T3 then he did in any of the other ones. He seemed a lot more like a machine.As for Nick Stahl playing John Connor, when i first heard that he was replacing Edward Furlong i was really angry. Furlong was the original John Connor, not to mention hes a great actor. He would have been perfect to play Connor again. But i was pleasantly suprised, Nick Stahl played the part great, and you got the feel that he was very nervous, and unstable about judgement day and his destiny from the first moment you saw him. Kathryn Brewster(Claire Danes)is Connors supporting character and Danes does a much better job then i thought she was going to do. All in All, the acting was very well done.The plot had some holes in it but not too bad. I think that they could have cleared a few things up. However, the ending stole the entire movie. I was completely stunned at the end, and it was very unpredictable....i had NO clue it was even coming.All in All, definitly worth the $9.00, maybe another $9.00 if i want to go again.....i urge everyone to go see this movie, it was great8.5/10",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

I think TX was brilliant and the new Terminator was good (darker than the last Terminator etc.) John Conner was ok I suppose yet disappointing not to see Edward reprise his role.The ending, I must say was quiet sad in a dramatic way, considering the EFFORT they put in to save the world was pointless ONLY to realise that they couldn't save anyone...-- BUT!!!!!Now that he knows of these events. I'm sure he can send someone back to prevent SKYNET EVER going online - That would be his mission and he would surely save everyone. Its OPEN for a fourth installment and I must say that I loved TX - Kristanna was AMAZING and SEXY! The terminatrix was sexy. Not often you meet a girl who can make her breats bigger.The Special FX was great. I wasn't sure if the future sequence were all models of CGI - They were good but I didn't like Nicholas playing older John in the future...I like the fact that the Terminator that killed future John protects the past John (that's funny) - It has its humurous moments. The ending IS FANTASTIC from the last 2.Don't expect it to be better than T2. Just sit and enjoy it all - A fantastic sci-fi film. Maybe a classic...dunno.

1017,ruibento,"Terminator 3 - the machines do rise, but the movie lets down",3,6 September 2005,"Responsible for James Cameron's career boost, back in 1984, was the dark action-meets-horror ""The Terminator"". More than another thriller, this was a mark on the history of cinema, not only for its special effects and action sequences, but for its innovator story and plot. The idea of a terminator that came back from the future to murder the mother of a boy who would become the leader of human resistance in a few decades caught everyone attention. Seven years later, James Cameron did what most directors are unable to: the sequel to ""The Terminator"", named ""Terminator 2: The Judgement Day"", surpassed the first film. With the intelligent twist of turning the first film's villain into the second one's hero, along with the introduction of the teenager John Connor and the ultimate villain T-1000, drove this film to the top, making it one of the best action / science-fiction pictures of all times.Because of all of this mystic surrounding the Terminator series, I was ecstatic with the announcement of the release of a sequel to the series, ""Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines"". Eventually, my expectations lowered a little when I knew James Cameron wouldn't be involved in it, although John D. Brancato and Michael Ferris (responsible for David Fincher's underrated ""The Game"") and Jonathan Mostow would be directing it.Ten years after Terminator 2, Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) died of leukemia and John Connor (Edward Fulrong / Nick Stahl) became a recluse, always isolated from society. This introduces the new chapter in the Terminator series. This time, the T-850 Cyberdyne Systems Model 101 (Arnold Schwarzenegger) travels back in time to protect not only John Connor, but also a woman whose name is Katherine Brewster (Claire Danes) from another enemy: the terminatrix T-X (Kristanna Loken). But who was this Brewster character and why would the T-850 want to protect her? The answer is simple: she was going to marry John Connor and have children with him. Together, they would lead the human resistance against the machines in a not-so-distant future.Unfortunantely, it's when the existence of the terminators is justified by the authors that the plot reaches mediocrity. The excuse found for the return of the terminators is no other than fatality, the inevitability of destiny. Besides bringing up a lot of philosophical issues, this «plot twist» makes us think that all the efforts of Sarah, John and the T-800 to destroy the Cyberdyne building were completely and utterly useless. And it also makes ""destiny"" a fact and not an open discussion (like the existence of God, for that matter): Terminators were meant to exist and there's nothing anyone or anything can do to stop it, it's just fate. A poor excuse, in my opinion.The key-character, the T-850 (and not the T-800 as in the previous two films) is also a little disappointing. Why? After becoming a complex and almost touching character in Terminator 2, with a great chemistry between him and John Connor, the Terminator is little more than a machine and there's not the least sign of a relation between him John. This fits the plot created for this film, but it takes out something that was fundamental for the success of ""Judgement Day"". The only point where the authors tried to add a little humanity to the machine was when he had to face the duel between what he was programmed to do and what he «should» to: the results was terrible. At the same time, it's undeniable that Schwarzenegger's performance did put a lot of charisma into the character and it was very good to see him playing the Terminator once more. It's very hard to believe that Arnold is in his 50's, due to his great physical shape. On the other hand, the terminatrix T-X causes very little impact, despite her great attributes as a killing machine (the arms that become lethal weapons, the ability to connect to the internet and doing DNA exams in the blink of an eye, etc). It's impossible not to compare Loken's T-X to Richard Patrick's T-1000 and the second one is a clear winner. The T-1000 was a much more menacing character than the T-X and this is probably not just because of the actors, but because of the atmosphere of this film: it seems to be shot in daylight all the time, meaning that it does not have that dark side that were obvious in the other two films and were part of their greatness - the two first Terminators were thrillers and this is absolutely just an action movie.Nevertheless, despite the poor story and plot schemes, Mostow tries to draw the attentions off the plot and on the spectacular action sequences. And this is where the film's strength resides, even though the action reaches its climax early in the film. In conclusion, the third film of the Terminator saga is a close cousin to Terminator 2, since exploits the same theme of the good terminator who travels back in time to protect John Connor (and, this time, Kate Brewster) and the bad terminator who tries to do the opposite. Unfortunately, I have to admit that this was a disappointment, mostly because of its weak story and plot, but also because of the film's atmosphere (not dark at all and doesn't make you sit on the edge of your seat like the first two films did) and the lack of charisma of both John Connor (not because of Stahl's acting, but because of what Connor grows up to be; nevertheless, I would definitely like to see Edward Fulrong playing John Connor once more - after all, it was his character) and T-X. In my opinion, the emotional appeal of the terminator series along with the action sequences rescue the movie from complete failure.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
1018,goldenX87,"""This commercial fluff was nothing but a money-maker to bridge Cameron's work with the hanging Terminator 4.""",1,7 July 2003,"If you're looking for mindless, repetitive, and hardly groundbreaking CG action sequences, T3 should give you underwhelming entertainment, and leave you with absolutely nothing, except how the script was approved, to reflect upon. Cameron would be rolling over in his grave (if he were dead) at this piece of marketing garbage. The previous movies' ability to stand on their own, and Judgment Day's excellent departures from the original to make a fresh experience. This commercial fluff was nothing but a money-maker to bridge Cameron's work with the hanging Terminator 4. Not to mention interesting and suspenseful storylines, character's that are a little thicker than cardboard cutouts, and flat out BRILLIANT action sequences, even without the capabilities of today's computer animation.The reversal's presented in the earlier films (Arnold, the traditional hero, becoming the relentless killing machine in the former, and then turning the tables to become an always-there dependable father figure) were not here. And while you can basically predict the ending's of Cameron's films, you don't see (SPOILERS) Reese or the Terminator's death at the end of each picture. The hack's responsible for this mess could have at least thought about throwing us a curve _somewhere_.As far as I'm concerned, this is nothing but an expensive and quality piece of mediocre ""fan fiction,"" not part of the actual Terminator continuity.

I just don't understand this at all. Being a fan of the original Terminator and T2 I found the third installment appropriate and extremely entertaining. Every movie has it's downspots and this one is no different but on the whole, T3 was a great movie. The plot was good and consistent throughout, the storyline flowed nicely, the action was amazing and the intensity increased as we got deeper and deeper into the environment. Even my wife, who is not particularly a fan of the Terminator films, enjoyed this one. The characters were well developed and, contrary to some reviews, the acting was quite good. There was a story to follow and it keeps you guessing. There are some obvious conclusions that can be made but for every one of those there's also a surprise. The casting was a concern for me until I saw the film and when I left the theatre I was convinced that they made some smart decisions in their actor choices.I would definately recommend T3 to anyone. People who have seen the original and T2 and anyone who has no clue what Terminator is all about.

Arnie's ability to make fun of himself is always a good thing, as most actors are unwilling, or unable to do this. I could cite a few scenes, but I won't because of some people, like myself, who hate spoilers. I thought the action scenes were good, and as morbid as this may sound, the execution scenes.

1022,PHeron,Biggest disappointment since Batman Forever (many spoilers),1,31 July 2003,"I went to see this film not expecting much and yet this film still managed to deliver even less that that.  This was by far the biggest let down since Warners let Schumacher loose on the Batman franchise.Firstly, when did the Terminator films become comedies.  True there were a few jokes in T2, but this was criminal.  From Arnie donning the Elton specs to ""I'm back"" I was cringing throughout this hell.Next, I know it's impossible to watch a film about time travel without noticing flaws, but this film was beyond the pale such as the fact that Cyberdyne has been destroyed yet the Terminators still resemble Arnie and have the Cyberdyne serial no's.  Plus there were all the classic story flaws such as the TX being a vast improvement on the t-1000.  OK, I might be wrong but she seemed to take a beating, from her weapon malfunctioning to being crushed by a helicopter (the T-1000 walked away unscathed from a helicopter crash in T2).I don't mind a few plot points being delicately nudged into a film, but this was shocking.  Where did Arnie's explosive cells come from.  Surely this would have been a hazard when he dropped into the lava at the end of T2. My favourite by far, though, was Clare Danes shouting, ""it's my father's plane, I trained in it"".  Phew what a relief, if she hadn't they never would have made it to the thrilling finale.All in all this was a shocker, from the stilted screenplay to the shocking filming (no need for slow-mo every scene Mostow).

1024,muhammad-uz-rauf,A terminator rated PG13...??? Are you kidding me?,6,26 August 2008,"In my opinion, and in actual fact the second terminator was the best of the 3. It consisted everything a movie that is called ""The Terminator"" should consist of. It was incredible intense, hardcore, and gripping the entire movie and I loved it. It was actually rated 'R' meaning that there is blood and intensity in the move. The special effects were fantastic. One thing that really caught my attention in terms of intensity was when Sarah Connor broke out of her room and threatened the man with a needle containing oil/poisoin which was already inserted into the mans neck, waiting to be injected. The blood and violence was increbly gripping as well. Not to mention the great acting from all who played in the movie, not to mention John Connor! The things he taught the terminator to help him act like a normal human being was funny and interesting.Terminator 3 was a disappointment in my oppionion. First of all a terminator movie Rated PG13...? Doesn't make sense, and the blood, violence and overall intensity were poor and the acting wasn't too great either.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
1025,samuelmiller,"Better action than Matrix, but loss of T story...",9,2 July 2003,"A few have already said this, but I'll say it again anyway... It would have been  better with James Cameron.  The acting was not up to par, and the overall aura  of the film lacked from the feel of T1 & T2. I'll say now that I did like it very much, but not nearly as much as the first two. There are some things that just don't make sense, but there were those in the  first 2 as well.  Whenever you deal with time travel you are going to have some  holes in the plot.  I wasn't bothered by ""when or why"" the Terminators were sent  back.  I was bothered, however, by John Conner talking to Arnold and  seemingly unaware that it was not the same Arnold from T2.  I mean, doesn't he  remember the Arnold from T2 was destroyed? Conner was there and saw him die, I would have thought it'd make an impact. The new Conner just seems dumb.  This brings me to say that Stahl is no Furlong--maybe for the better in  real life, but not in the movie. The action scenes were indeed amazing.  I saw Matrix 2 last week, and unfortunately had to sit through near 20 minutes of men jumping all over cars  and trucks on the freeway.  The chase scene in T3 is short and sweet and originally well done. There is some humor in the film, which is nice. The acting, as I said earlier,  could have been better--especially when compared to the first two with Linda Hamilton.  It was a shame she wasn't in this one.  I assume they just couldn't get  her to do it. The female terminator was okay.  And I have no problem with Claire Danes, aside from the fact that the more new people in the film, the less like ""Terminator"" it feels. I won't spoil anything here, but if you've seen the movie you'll know what I mean:   There is certainly space for a T4, and it certainly could be great--but only if  Cameron have more say in this film.  Otherwise, it should be under a different  name. I'll sum it up by saying that T3 is a great action flick, but it lacks the sci-fi feel of  like the other 2 (especially the first, did).  However, it would have been nice to  end the series at T2, or get Cameron and the original cast to make a movie more similar to the first two.  It's turning more into a ridiculous action film--don't  get me wrong, good action--but lacking story...",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
1026,ShewBacka,Typical 3rd Entry,10,2 July 2003,"T3 is like most other third entries into trilogies: it has run out of steam. The idea of a futuristic, omnipotent robot being sent back into time to eradicate the head of a stubborn resistance to a future apocalypse was novel in 1984 and was mastered in 1991.  But now it is getting old, just like Arnie.The following is a step by step analysis of why T2 just didn't work.SPECIAL EFFECTS:  The notion that after a 12 year impeovement in technology and 70 million dollar increase in budget will ensure superior special effects is a given.  T3 has better special effects than T2.  But that is the only significant category that it scores a win.VILLAIN:  This was the biggest mistake made by the developers of this film. The TX was not nearly as imposing or fearsome as either of her predecessors. I just don't have the same fear of a woman that I would a man.  Secondly, why would Skynet go back to an exoskeleton robot?!  Robert Patrick's liquid metal was an idea that should have been expanded in this movie, not scrapped.  They should have gone with Vin Diesal, a man who can hold his own with Arnie.JOHN CONNOR:  Although Stahl was adequate as Furlong's replacement, he didn't have the same edge.PLOT:  There were way too many holes in this plot.  So many things were left either unexplained or were not elaborated on.  For example, how could Skynet have been created after they destroyed its roots in T2?  Granted, the end twist was clever, and the last 30 minutes were definetely a return to T2 form, but it just didn't feel like a Terminator movie, and too many questions were left unanswered.  Interestingly, hints were given for a T4, and the ending left that door wide open and swinging.MUSIC:  Music plays a vital role in the suspense of a movie.  So many times in T3, I was wishing for the T2 theme to start playing.  It really would have added to the adrenaline rush that I felt so many times in T2.In conclusion, T3 seemed like a hastily prepared entry into such an intricately developed franchise.  While T2 is the greatest action movie of alltime, T3 is an adequate sequel, highly entertaining (in part because of the humorous side to it), but nothing more.  It sits nicely alongside the first two, and is by no means a Jaws 3, but doesn't have the chemistry that either of the first two had.  Mostow is not Cameron, Loken is not Patrick, Stahl is not Furlong, and even though Arnie was still Arnie, T3 is not T2.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

It could be one of the best in the series, and I am one of the die hard fans for the terminator series. It is Worthy of 1st or 2nd. The action is incredible. It was some of the best special effects ever. It looked as real as it could get. Even though Cameron was not the director, it would not have made a difference.

1028,LordShank79,"Won't win any Oscars, but entertaining nonetheless",9,6 August 2003,"Terminator 3 is solid, uninspiring action fare, made highly watchable by it's sense of humour and refusal to take itself seriously. Quite an impressive feat, considering the film's subject matter (the world effectively destroying itself in a frenzy of nuclear missiles!)Jonathan Mostow directs without any pretentiousness, and has, at the very least, created one of the most grandiose and exciting car chases in recent memory. The effects are tremendous, and Arnold is on top form returning to his best-loved character. Some of his one-liners fail to hit the spot, but on the most part they succeed in entertaining, and the way he finds his trademark leather jacket is an unexpected treat.Nick Stahl and Claire Danes are fine in their roles, though I was somewhat underwhelmed overall. Considering the powerhouse performances of the likes of Linda Hamilton in the first two movies, that isn't too surprising.Popcorn fare of a very high quality, Terminator 3 is a weak film when judged as part of the Terminator canon, but in it's own way a real cinematic treat for a Friday evening.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
1029,Quietman77,Worth Seeing - Could have been better.,7,3 July 2003,"I'll try my best to keep this spoiler free:THE GOOD: The two terminators - Arnold knows exactly how to play this character. He manages to make Terminator likeable, even amusing. (Why not? Everyone knows ahead of time that he's a hero.) Still, he never lets us forget that he's a super-badass killing machine. Pretty good trick for a guy in his mid 50s :)Kristanna Loken, while not quite as menacing as Robert Patrick was in T2 (Who is?), nevertheless does a fine job. She is extremely sexy, and yet, I never took her lightly. Also, I enjoyed those little bits of emotion that the director allows her show. I've been waiting a long time for a Terminator that actually ENJOYS killing, and can get excited at the prospect of finding an unexpected target.The T-X is a great concept... in theory. Combining both of the previous variants (T-1000-ish shapeshifting metal, covering an armed-to-the-teeth skeleton) is a logical extrapolation of the idea, and COULD have made her the most frightening Terminator yet.The action scenes involving Terminator and/or T-X were outstanding. Terrific fight scenes, particularly the ""bathroom"" fight, and the end of the truck-vs.-mobile-crane chase scene.There are a few parts of the movie that genuinely surprised me. I honestly didn't see the ending coming. (In hindsight, I should have.) Also, the explanation of how this particular Terminator came into the the human resistance's possession... Without spoiling anything, let's just say that it was quite chilling.THE ADEQUATE: This may be a matter of opinion, but I thought the T-X died a little too quickly and too easily, particularly for such potent villain.The human leads - John Connor (Nick Stahl), Kate Brewster (Claire Danes), General Brewster (David Andrews), etc. were OK, but that's all they were. None of them were able to dominate a scene like Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) and Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton). These humans NEEDED Arnold on their side to make them interesting.It's the script's fault, not Nick Stahl's, but I'd hoped for more, much much more, from John Connor. In T2, Sarah Connor was absolutely larger-than-life (albeit insane); I could easily imagine Skynet fearing her. In this movie, we only see faint glimpses of that from John Connor, and IMHO that wasn't enough.The action scenes that didn't include either Terminator or T-X were relatively weak. Not horrible, but not particularly memorable either.The film is generally lighter than the previous two, both literally and figuratively. Fewer critical scenes took place at night, and there was more humor. This is both good and bad. The jokes generally worked, thanks largely to Arnold's deadpan delivery, and this movie didn't look or feel like a carbon copy of the previous two, as it easily could have. Still, much of the sense of urgency was lost.THE BAD: The T-X's capabilities, in practice, were inconsistently written, and sometimes distracted from the story. For example, how can she remotely drive four cars? Even if she is a super-whiz-bang computer, something in the cars has to physically push the pedals and turn the steering wheels.How can she ""infect"" a computer system that doesn't have any modems or interfaces? I think Arnold says something about ""nanotechnology"" but that drifts a little too far into technobabble.How does T-X mimic complex machines? Sure, I can imagine her having a blaster and a few critical power tools stored in her skeleton. However, I simply cannot accept her being able to turn her limbs into flame throwers, complicated gizmos, etc.I'll usually overlook technical details (these are just movies), but not when those details make it difficult for me to suspend my disbelief. Furthermore, none of those capabilities helped to advance the plot in any meaningful way; all could easily have been been written out. The basic concept behind the T-X is more than adequate, without resorting to magic tricks.Additionally, as other reviewers have mentioned, there are significant plot holes. I won't repeat or describe them here, since they'd be spoilers, but holes do exist. I'm anxious to see the deleted scenes when this movie comes out on DVD; It might help to explain things a bit better.Finally, as others have said, Linda Hamilton is sorely missed. I don't know why she wasn't included in T3, but hope that the choice was hers, and hers alone. If the producers didn't want her, or if they decided that her asking price was too high, bad call.CONCLUSION: I enjoyed T3, I'm glad I saw it, and I'll see it again. However I'll probably wait until it makes it's way to a second-run theater (ie. reduced ticket price). Once at full price is enough.Bottom line - Terminator and T2 were two of the all-time great movies. T3 was a very good popcorn movie (particularly during this very disappointing year) but it lacked greatness.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
1030,Saber0307,Better than expected,8,2 July 2003,"When I went to go see T3 today, I wasn't expecting much. This was forthree reasons:1) Its a modern day sequel based on great classic movies, and most modern sequels suck. 2) It wasn't directed or written by James Cameron. 3) How the hell could the story fit?! IT ENDED IN T2!So, I went in with not expecting much. God I was wrong. While it isn't as good as THE TERMINATOR or its sequel TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY, I say it was very entertaining. The action sequences were good, and the story fit well into the existing time line. The acting was also very good. I was kind of disappointed that Edward Furlong didn't come back to play John Connor, and I was really hoping for a cameo of Linda Hamilton's Sarah Connor and Michael Biehn's Kyle Reese (I know he is dead, but he did make a cameo in T2, just watch the deleted scenes on the T2 Extreme DVD), but we can't have everything now, can we? I was also pleased that there were some very funny inside jokes to us Terminator fans.Also, the T-X was a pretty good ruthless villain, even though she will never compare to Robert Patrick's T-1000 or Arnold's original T-101. The movie also, of course, sets up for a sequel which will be very interesting (I'd tell you why, but then it would ruin the ending).Overall, it was pretty entertaining and better than expected.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

1037,ljuladet,Worth Watching,9,4 August 2003,"Beyond and over the protection of John Connor plus Kate Brewster (his future fiancé and co-commander against cyborgs), the film makes clear how and why those machines become self-function to destroy all human rather than repeatedly leave it as the matter of the future and insisting on mad individual fighting as in the first two only. It is an intelligent script despite the last one already showing that the microchip has been destroyed. The film suggests the fact that disaster, tragedy, impact is never avoidable as long as we - human - keep raising our power competition through the destructive technology. Regarding the film content, what I'd like to summarize is it could be the boring repetition, if there is nothing new within it in which the traditional storyline is always used for the dynamic images and narrative for its fans. This is - probably - why the script was created with the emphasis on the new issues in addition to keeping its typical form and content of Terminator which is widely perceived.Further to this, whoever loves the first two made by Cameron may get disappointed with this one while I whose abhorrence towards those feel it is what I have been waiting for. Anyway, I love all of them.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
1038,TheCause,Best movie of 2003 IMHO!,10,2 November 2003,"I loved this movie. I don't exactly know why I liked it so much, but I think it was just about everything.I liked the second movie, but I that T3 had a higher level of sophistication and maturity as it ought to. There is nothing finer than a well produced movie with a full orchestra and a good, well presented theme. The themes in the first and second movies where transparent and never narrated, but if you look at T3, you will notice that the theme is so prominant that not only is it included in the subtitle just as in the second movie, but also the theme is narrated by John C. which I think is very important for setting a mood and I would say is appropriate in a sci-fi movie such as this one. Throught the whole movie character developement is strong. Arnold's character is used as both a metaphore of total annihilation and a foil for Nick's more fleshy character, John. Briliant. Additionally, the movie has great visuals and the action wasn't so quick that the projector couldn't keep up. The action was however largescale and very exciting while believable.My only beef with this movie is that it was too good to only be 120 minutes long. That's what a lot of people have been complaining about and I think they're 100% right. Let's hope the DVD has lots of extra scenes!Good Day!",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
1039,PJ19I18,Disappointment Hurts,8,4 July 2003,"The Terminator series began with two thought provoking well done films. The second one, while incorporating mindless action, still stay true to the spirit of the original.  The third is contrived, derived, and shallow. LEss U571, more Terminator 1, please.  Thanks",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
1040,djmarkmadness,A worthy sequel to a winding down franchise.,7,3 July 2003,"CONTAINS MILD SPOILERS I expected to go to this movie and be extremely disappointed with it. The original director/writer James Cameron was missing, Arnold was getting caught up by his age, and it's been over a decade since T2. Instead I was actually quite satisfied with Jonathan Mostows take on Terminator.I thought that the character acting was quite well done. Nick Stahl wasn't exactly powerful with his performance as John Connor but this was a good thing because it seemed that the focus of the film was no longer on him anyways. Claire Danes while making a wonderful damsel in distress didn't really convince me that she was to be a key lieutenant of the future but I guess that's how Linda Hamilton's character was in the first film so it's all the more intriguing. Arnold's performance was of course perfect. He easily recaptured the Terminator persona and was even able to pull off some good humor with a straight face. Kristanna Loken's terminator did her job but wasn't really as intimidating as the original T-800 or the T-1000. Maybe because it was a woman this time I don't know. It's most likely the fact that I had the phrase ""been there done that"" echoing in my head since we all knew Arnold would win in the end.The plot was probably the weakest category of this film. Unlike T2 there wasn't really any good sub-plot to keep the viewer intrigued between explosions. However luckily the key pressure points and a surprise twist ending kept things interesting. Some claim this is just a rip-off of movies like the Matrix because it involves computers taking over the world. Those hippie Matrix fan boys should not be listened to since this has been the key concept for the last 19 years of the franchise!As for the action, some may complain it's pretty much the same as T2. Why is this a bad thing!? The chase scene alone was enough to give any action fan their fix. Anyone who says otherwise probably doesn't believe the phrase ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it.""Overall, I definitely recommend this film. Though not as strong as the first two films, it still kept the Terminator franchise on its feet and had decent entertainment value. It could have been worse and completely spoil the series like a certain three prequel films from a certain popular space fighting franchise from far, far away. If this is the last film, it didn't end with a bang but with a solid satisfying march out the door. If T4 is made then at least T3 held the bridge up instead of letting it crash down. 3 out of 5.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
1041,omnivisor,Graded with excellence,6,7 July 2003,"The main problem I had with Terminator 3: Rise of The Machines is that it's a film that feels a bit too familiar. While I would say that T3 does have many action sequences, that in itself is the problem. T3 feels like one long chase scene, but offers no real reward at the end.  Character development seems to be drowned in the relentless action, and the film suffers from it as a result. Also the plot line seems to be borrowed from its predecessor T2, making it very predictable, and somewhat outdated; especially when swartzenegger spills his famous line ""I'll be back,"" that was popular over a decade ago. There is a fine light in the film, and that light comes in the form of Claire Danes, who plays an everywoman veterinarian. Danes adds a bright spot with her fine acting skills, but she seems as though she could have contributed more to the film, had the film actually focused on characters, rather than being forced to giveway to exploding cars, and other mindless action that would make a demolition derby seem sophisticated.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
1042,level5nerd,Good enough (Heavy spoilers),8,2 July 2003,"Again, there are some very strong spoilers.  I liked this movie a lot -- it was almost as good as the first, possibly slightly better.  The ending, and I won't say exactly what happens, sent some very strong chills down my spine.  The original had an almost perfect screenplay (aside from the fact that Kyle's flashbacks always end in certain death with no explanation of his escape), but there were some problems with acting and SFX.  The second one had no substance whatsoever.  In fact, one of my biggest complaints was that it reworked the handling of the time travel paradox -- in the first movie, the future created itself, while in the second, it prevented itself. They can't have it both ways.  If they had had this as the sequel (with a few changes), it would have been an improvement over the original, maybe even a perfect 10.  Sadly, the second movie dragged down the franchise. 7/10.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
1043,BKT900,WOW!,5,1 July 2003,"SPOILER ALERT!!!I loved it. What can i say! This movie is definitely my favorite of the series. Not only does it tell a great story, but it has awesome action scenes. The pacing is fast, just like the first Terminator film.The acting is top notch and the ending is just awesome. Not only is it thought provoking, but it is also very emotional.Ties in very well with T1 and T2, and it continues the mythology of John Connor in an excellent way. At the beginning of the film, he is a slacker who wants no part of his destiny. At the end of the film, he accepts his fate as the leader of the human resistance against Skynet.10/10",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
1044,BKT900,WOW!!,5,2 July 2003,"Ii have waited for this film for years, and let me tell you, it was worth the wait. The first time i watched T3, i came out with mixed feelings because all the scenes that i really wanted to see in the film were missing. I was really looking forward to seeing the CRS build T-1s and T-600/800 endoskeletons. Most of all, i wanted to see Chief Master Sergeant William Candy. When i watched the movie, i saw that many scenes were cut out. So, when i watched T3 for the second time, I LOVED IT. Things just fit together perfectly. T3 is definitely my favorite of the trilogy. IMO, it told the coolest story out of the three. We finally see Skynet's rise to power. Also, the story had heart and it had a soul. T3 was basically John Connor's story. At the beginning of the film, he is a slacker who wants no part of his destiny. At the end of the film, he finally accepts his fate as the leader of the human race. Nick Stahl gave a fantastic performance as John Connor, he made you care for the character and he actually made the character's inner emotional struggle throughout the film believable. Claire Danes was excellent as Kate Brewster. Kate is very much like the Sarah Connor of the first film. She is an innocent woman who is suddenly taken away from her life and put into a world full of terror and death. Kate is very important to the plot of the film and to the terminator story as a whole. Arnold is perfect as The Terminator, what else can i say? Kristanna Loken gave a great performance as the T-X. IMO, she was just as terrifying and menacing as Robert Patrick's T-1000. The rest of the cast does a fine job as well. The humor worked fine IMO, it was very similar to T2 in this aspect. The humor comes at the right time. To all the naysayers, this IS NOT a remake or a rehash of T2. It is a worthy continuation of the terminator story full of new and fresh ideas. The ending of the film is just awesome. Its probably the best ending in years. Same goes for the action and special effects. Stan Winston and ILM did an excellent job. Kudos to Jonathan Mostow to staying true to T-1 and T2 and giving us a terrific third installment. Hopefully, he will return for T4, which will be the full future war film. 10/10",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
1045,SchockerGD,The sequel that breaks the trilogy curse!,10,4 July 2003,"I've been waiting 12 years for a new Terminator movie. Having watched T-1 and T-2 roughly 50 times each, I would consider myself a huge Terminator fan.This movie delivers the best movie of the year, and its doubtful very many movies could top this (aside from possibly ROTK, should it be good).John Mostow provides an interesting, new perspective on the franchise. Having been dissapointed with most of Camerons recent work, I am very glad he did this movie.The acting in the movie is pure gold, some of the best active I've seen. Arnold, Nick, Kristanna and Claire prove to be equal to any of the actors in the previous versious of the franchise.Action scenes are equal to both T-1 and T-2 in terms of intensity, possibly surpasing both.The pacing of the movie is very well done. Having been saddened by the poor job on Matrix : Reloaded, this movie (aside from a 5 second scene) has excellent pacing. DO NOT expect to get a chance to get up and goto the bathroom.I've read that some film critics claim that this Terminator doesn't have a story, nor a heart (compared to either of the earlier movies) is rather wrong. The theme of the movie is different from T-1 and T-2.Unlike T-1 and T-2, which have messages of hope during horrible circumstances, T-3 heart lies in inevitability, fate and destiny. John's portrayl of hopelessness is excellent.*Possible Spoilers*The movie does take about 15 minutes to start up, but after that, is excellent. The direction of how the machines take over is brilliant. I was stunned at the portrayl of the actual rise of the machines. Even though there is a lack of future war scenes, the movie makes up in the beginning of the war. I doubt that any director could do a better job.The only complaints I could have in the movie is the 5 second scene where Arnold puts on his glasses for the first time, which was humorous, but not needed. As well as the fact the movie didn't quite have the B-rated sheen that the first 2 had.I was suprised at 2 things which pleased me, the suspence and violence. Mostow did a better job with these 2 things than either Terminator.*End possible Spoilers*Having said all that, I'd look at it this way, on a scale of 1-10T-1 = 9.75 T-2 = 9.30 T-3 = 8.75-9.00Go see this movie, and if you've seen it, see it again!",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
1046,ledow,A worthy sequel.,9,11 August 2003,"As a fan of both previous Terminator films, I wasn't expecting much from the third.  Need I say Alien 3?  I was hoping that they wouldn't detract from the true basis of Terminator and they haven't.It keeps the plot and actually fits quite well.  There are no ""let's tack this on so that we have a plot for the third film"" extrapolations, we finally find out what type of machine SkyNet is.It has a touch of humour but nothing that stops it from being a Terminator film.  Sometimes you are watching the screen for minutes at a time during the action scenes, not because it's a massive fight, just for the ideas that the characters use to get their own way.The Arnie Terminator is a bit meaner than the one in Terminator 2, less human.  The new female Terminator isn't as rubbish as the trailers show. The computer graphics are used sparingly and only where they're needed.John Connor isn't the world leader you expect him to be, but that's because he hasn't gotten there yet.  The character seems to follow from Terminator 2 quite well, though.There are no glaring movie-isms... the new technology is pretty and not too elaborate.  Computers look like computers, the city like a city etc.All in all, worth a watch for fans of both the first films.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

""but the story was good!""  it really wasn't.  ""the action scenes were great!""  yeah, that's why we all saw it in the first place. same with ""hulk"".  i liked it.  i'm not going to defend it.
terminator 3 though...this has been the best and most enjoyable action movie this summer.  the story - for how little attention they gave it - worked just fine and was easily understandable.  no need to see it a second time to figure out what the hell they're talking about.  i'll see it again just because it was sooooooooooooo freaking enjoyable!  i mean hulk?  matrix? even x2!  these aren't action movies!  terminator 3 is an action movie, best one i've seen in a while.  suspense!  there was actual suspense!  yeah! and the end?  oh no!  very good, good stuff.  i will take it personally when people say they didn't like this movie.  i will defend it.  take note of the small details in this movie.  they're important, and they ARE there.  ""it would've been soooo much better if cameron had directed it.""  comparisons are stupid.  just because it's a franchise doesn't mean you should compare directors.  except if it's george lucas, who somehow screwed his own franchise by being the director. let me direct episode 3.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

It's more like a cover version, say The Datsuns covering an AC/DC song.Some of Arnie's lines are so bad such as `It's time', `I'm back' and, probably the most embarrassing part in the film, when he tells a guy at a checkout `talk to the hand'.We knew it was coming, we knew it was never gonna be as good as part 2, and it isn't.On the plus side, the new TX is very fit in her cherry red leather outfit and there are some really funny scenes and a couple of good action scenes.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

This movie surpased all of my expectations. The ending was, I think, the best possible ending for the movie, it completely surprised me & I will not forget it any time soon. The car chase after the vet's was better than The Matrix Reloaded's, which was overrated. Arnold did a surprisingly good job at his 3rd time being the Terminator, many of his lines are humorous without being corny. The T-X was pretty cool but the T-1000 would own her any day of the week except on Mondays because that's the day that he gets the nerve endings in his face disabled because that man has THE coldest face I've ever seen. The few scenes of the missiles launching & landing at the end were also very cool &, to me, gave the movie a better sense of being a reality.

I will say, however, I did go into this movie with very little expectations so perhaps thats why I enjoyed it so much. I was pleasantly surprised.  In a era of mindless summer blockbusters, maybe we all should just put our brains to bed for a bit and go out and be entertained.  Not all of us are long-haired, overweight, losers who still live at home and have aspirations of attending film school and directing the next great sci-fi epic.

Nick Stahl just seems to exist in the film only to give a body to John Conner, but with all the car chases, gun battles, and explosions most people aren't going to notice. Arnold has still got it.

1062,Droogie502,Best Film Of The Summer!!! Listen To Me!!!,10,9 July 2003,"Just as everyone else, I walked into the theater very skeptical, pretty doubt ridden about this 3rd installment. You all know the reasons, I'll skip those. At age 24, I now have matured as a filmgoer in the sense that I can really indentify a well made flick when I see one. Listen to me when I say that T3 is not only the best film of the summer, but of the best of the year.Those out there that are tired of CGI dominated action flicks will especially appreciate the large, large amount of stunt work done to avoid as much CGI as possible. The film has more action sequences than any other action flick before, and the best part is none of it is overkill, it's all necessary for the plot. The screenplay really blew me away, it was reported that Schwartzenegger went through several scripts until he found the one that struck him hard. I will not give anything away but it really allows for great acting turns from the whole cast (Schwartzenegger is in absolute top-form) specifically Mr. Stahl and Ms. Danes who have incredible chemistry.Matrix Reloaded, Hulk, 2 Fast 2 Furious, and other soon to be big budget dissapointments cannot hold a candle to T3, proving once again that a Terminator flick will always destroy every other entry into the sci-fi genre. Oh and I almost forgot to mention the T-X Ms. Lokken who is blazingly sexy and dangerous, was a great casting call. I rate this film a SOLID 10 OUT OF 10, it was definately every second of the 12 years we had to wait, so get out of your seat and shut down your computer and get your keister into the theater, for 109 minutes of the most fun you can have!!!",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
1063,ragekorne,AMAZING!!!!!!,8,2 July 2003,"Lets just say like any self-respecting man I am an extreme fan of the terminator films.  From the moment I saw Arnold knock on a door and ask ""Sarah Connor?"" followed by smashing through it and absolutely going to town on her with a gun to make sure the woman died, I knew I had found that edgy sci-fi gold.  The Terminator had it all.  Action, cat and mouse games, sci-fi, originality, humor, and above all the ability to make you believe in what you were seeing.  Then guess what, a few years later a sequal came and blew it away.  Terminator 2 still stands as one of my favorite films of all time.  It had everything the first had and then some.  Emotion, state of the art special effects (which are now the mainstream), and more.  I can still watch that movie over and over.  It not only stands the test of time, it created the term ""Better than the first!!""  Now, years later a third terminator film is being released.  Believe me, if you're a terminator fan you should be excited as hell.  Not worried.  I was able to check out the film last night, and before it began I thought to myself, ""If there's one thing I hope they don't mess up, please let it be the FEEL of the other two movies.""  Jonathan Mostow, I applaud you.  I was a fan of your work before but I am extremely grateful you kept this franchise together.  I love the way you worked in everything.  This is as good a sequal as any and it fits in perfectly with the first two.  The acting is top-notch, Kristinna Loken stands out as the baddy.  Ah-nuld is back in full form, and the rest of the cast is simply amazing as well.  Also, this is by far the funniest film of the trilogy.  This movie has it all.  The best car chase EVER!!! (yes, it blows away the matrix reloaded), the best fight scenes in a long time (I'm sick of every movie, unless it's the matrix franchise, having bullet-time effects and gravity defying kicks), the best story of the three films. It's all here and it's all amazing.  I couldn't find one thing I disliked. It's an awesome achievement.  It's a fitting sequal.  It's a fun ride.  It's a thought provoker.  It's a Classic.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

But I needn't have worried.  Jonathan Mostow has done a killer job with the continuation of the series (yes, I did say series and not trilogy)  Similar to the funny parts of Red Dragon, we find ourselves laughing uncontrollably at the exploits of the new T-101.  If anything is missing from the flick, it's the loss of a Brad Fiedel score...the one chase scene is virtually void of music in comparison to T2's canal chase. Would have liked to see how the movie would have been with Edward Furlong back as John Connor, but Nick Stahl does a respectable job---the local reviewer said he seemed like he'd get beat up quickly, but that's the WHOLE POINT...this is the story of how John learns to take responsibility for his inevitable destiny.

1065,fuzzymaggot,fortunately i got in for free,6,6 July 2003,"i was so hyped up to see this movie. from the day i first heard it was announced to the week of its release, it was the one movie i was actually looking forward to. buddy of mine that worked at our local cinema-plex got me in for free and i sat down with only the best of intentions. i knew something was wrong the minute the opening credits came up and ""holy sh*t?! wheres the all to familiar Terminator theme by Brad Fiedel?"" i almost wanted to cry. by the end of the movies i had more questions than just those to ask. like why did they send poor Arnold's model back to fight off the T-X? the t-800 vs. the t-1000 wasnt so bad and it put Arnold at a little disadvantage and made him have to outwit the thing. if they were even, then it wouldnt have been interesting. but the t-800 vs. the t-x wasnt even remotely fair. its like a toaster vs. a flamethrower. what the hell were the story writers thinking?acting wise, the movie was average. Arnold played his part as the emotionless cyborg excellently as usual. Nick Stahl was pretty convincing as the future leader John Connor and Claire Danes was just there. nothing really standing out in her role. Newcomer Kristanna Loken played the T-X very well. Unfortunately the new female terminator just didnt seem as terrifying as the previous terminators and really didnt give you that sense of hopelessness and despair as Robert Patrick's and Arnold's previous terminator roles did. you wanna be scared of the terminator, not drool over it. but i guess that was the whole point. drool and be scared at the same time.overall, Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines was an entertaining summer flick and one of the better big-budget action movies released in a while. the ending was one that made you think yet very dissapointing. kinda like terminator sorta kinda maybe 2.5. i think James Cameron's direction would have been much better. an average action flick with the Terminator name stamped on it.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
1066,imminteract,A Triumph,10,3 July 2003,"Well, after being treated to a sneak preview Tuesday night, I must say that this film is not what I originally expected.  The odds were against it: No Cameron, no Hamilton, no Eddie Furlong, but lo and behold, T3 is something of a masterpiece.  Not a perfect masterpiece, mind you.  But one truly worthy of note.It has been a long time since a Terminator film graced theaters, and many people thought that was due to script rewrites and such, when actually the original Carolco Pictures company went bankrupt sometime after the second film.  Legal battles ensued for years, and finally a phoenix rose from the ashes.  But enough of this prologue, is it good?From the unique presentation of the beginning (interwoven clips of the future and present-day footage) to the stirring action sequences (which unfortunately, harbor my only gripe), I was truly amazed with Jonathan Mostow's work.  I noticed that one review cited a plot hole:  the machines couldn't have reinstituted SkyNet because Arnold and the T-1000 were killed in the first one.  Well, one possibility is the arm.  Though it is not mentioned in the third installment, we all remember Arnold losing an arm in the second film, which was not destroyed.  Totally plausible.  There are other criticisms, but that was the most outspoken.  My only problems are the action sequences.  Yes they're great, and yes, the CG characters used in the scenes look more realistic than the Matrix Reloaded's Neo...but, sometimes there are too many cuts, and you lose track of where the action is.  Not enough wide establishing shots, too many closeups.  Of course a film is more cost-effective that way.All in all, great acting, a great script, and amazing special effects make this film enjoyable, but what makes it remarkable is its subtle touch of heart.  Go see it, bring your family, and remember Arnold's last words in this movie, ""We will meet again.""  Sequel?",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
1067,ahmadka,"Pretty Good, but too short (mine was 1 hour 42 min), and does NOT beat T2",6,5 July 2003,"Well, the movie in no way was bad. After all, the Judgement Day we heard about in T1 and T2 start in this movie. but still, I did not find the essence of the hardcore terminator, as there were several places where kiddy and babyish stuff was happening. But I would recommend it to all Terminator fans out ( Like Me). I think there might be a T4, since the ending was not proper. Arnie says ""We will meet again"" in the end of the movie, and I think the last sentence said in the movie was ""The Battle has just begun "". So, I sure hope there is a T4, which really kicks ass, but I dont want to wait another 10 years or so for it...",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
1068,daniel_collier,Terminator 3: Rise of Crap,5,2 August 2003,"A very poor film indeed! They creators have ditched plot, narrative, character development for some random explosions and not much else. Arnie barely spoke more than one liners, (or a few words in a sentence) and the other casting choices were a mistake to say the least.An open ended film which obviously makes way for another Terminator film. I cannot believe that they did this to the Terminator series, the first film was awesome (easily the best) and the second was quite good for its time. This film feels like they just wanted to cash in on the 'sequels/trilogies' thing going on right now.Some of the special effects were okay, but once again poor C.G.I. (like Hulk) ruined what could of been a great film. None of these people should work in Hollywood again!

1070,Kristanna,Another beloved TradeMark has been exploited...,4,3 September 2003,"Does the following two statements apply to you?Terminator - ""I liked it alot"".Terminator 2 - ""I loved it, it excelled in a superior manner.""If you answered ""yes"", then you will not like Terminator 3, and in truth you would be better off not seeing it. By not seeing it, you will preserve the memory of the two previous movies without tainting them. Should you despite this warning choose to view T3, then please note that you will never again be able to view the previous movies without conjuring up the ghosts of T3.Are you thinking ""it can't be that bad, this person just didn't understand it""?I too thought along this line when prewarned about it, I imagined that it had to have some entertaining qualities given it being a Terminator movie. Movies like that just aren't all-out bad.I was wrong, I should have listened to the person who warned me.Right about now you are thinking ""I refuse to be the only person on the planet to not have seen T3, simply because of a warning on IMDB.""Again, if the top two rows apply to you, then you will wish you had listened to this warning.Are you thinking ""this person is some kind of pro critic or really picky about movies, I just want to see what happened after T2""?No, I am not a professional critic, and I'm probably not more picky about movies than you. And yes, I sure wanted to see what happened after T2. But you see, you do not get to see what happened after T2, because the people responsible for that excellent script did not touch a page of this movie. It is entirely different. The company which made T2, Corolco, didn't produce this movie. Cameron did not co-write nor produce this movie.T3 is riddled with large caliber logic and story holes, many things don't add up and contradict the ""Terminator world"". The cast is really ill chosen, the T-X technology a bit too much for me, but the bottom line is that it doesn't have much of a story. Many movies don't actually need one, take ""Deep Blue Sea"" for instance, great entertainment without the need of a solid story. But the T movies already have a very cool story with, mostly, down-to-earth technology involved. Advanced, but mostly believable, and this goes for design also, the whole ""make it look cool"" clause from the first T2 book was very appealing to me as I enjoy things which look nice but also look practical enough to pass as a believable design. T3's tech and design is a bit different, clearly shown with both with the T-X and hardware in the 2029 scenes.Let me make it blatantly clear what we are talking about here. This will be fully understood by fans of the Aliens saga. I rank T3 as marginally better than ""Alien : Resurrection"", a movie which corrupted and devastated the the beloved Aliens saga. This statement will allow you to make your own references. If you liked ""Aliens : Resurrection"" and thought it to be a worthy follow-up to the earlier movies, then you will most probably love T3. If you on the other hand wish it had never come to exist, then you get an idea of my views on T3.I remember going to see ""Alien 3"" many years ago, I then expected something even better and more advanced than the prequel before it, I was utterly disappointed due to it not measuring up to my expectations. In retrospect, Alien 3 isn't really that bad, just different. I wish I could say the same for T3. I came to the theatre expecting something bad, due to numerous reviews, the intel of T3's budget problems and a script without Cameron. All of this negativity made me confident T3 would come out on top, seeing how I expected so little of it. But the disappointment was devastating. The worst part is that T3 has become a comedy, a quick action movie with dry jokes and one-liners accompanied with solid special effects. The movie mocks the previous two movies and tries to play the same jokes, whereas it comes out as a sad experience. Even the Terminators aren't really the same anymore, they are much more human, with facial expressions and logics that robots would never apply. The whole ""machine syndrome"" isn't apparent at all, which is one of the really nice things about T2, this ""man beside machine, examining the differences and similarities of her creation.""While T2's story was excellent, it had something else, call it ""storytelling""; the ability to tell a story in a flowing manner with scenes that logically follow eachother and keeps the viewer interested. This technique is one of the prime things that makes T2 excel and the prime thing that makes T3 crash and burn. The viewer is presented with scenes which appear to be cut together, where most are action scenes and the other scenes are dry humor. Humor will vary greatly between people, but as a preview of what to expect, I must say that a joke which was funny when Joe Pesci said it in Lethal Weapon 3, is certainly not funny 2003.I do apologize for the constant comparisons with Terminator and T2, such references do not belong in a review, but I felt it was needed so everyone reading this can examine my views on the previous movies and compare it with their own views. Without references that one can relate to, a review or criticism is simply an incomprehendable description from which it is difficult to form an opinion on.In truth, I do not want you to see T3. Yes, you will be one of the few on the planet who didn't see T3, but then again you will be one of the few people who has untainted, glorious memories of the first two movies. No one can change that.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
1071,pitchy444,awesome,10,26 August 2003,"may contain SPOILERprior too going to see this film in the U.K. i have read several message boards and T-3 really has had a fair number of critics. Though personally i found the film to be superb. Solid acting, and why has no1 else pointed out , Nick Stahl ( john connor) looks so much like Kyle Reece, his father T-1. so even though its a different actor 2 T-2 ( Edward furlong) i still felt it was John connor, unlike in other series of films where the characters are played by different actors. The affects were great, and the pace of the film was a lot better than Matrix reloaded, which  found tedious at points. sorry to mention The matrix, but it is basicly a rip off of terminator, with the added touch of a computerised world. eg THE ONE - John connor - Neo Enemy - the machines - the machines Real world - humans dead, humans deadi wont go on as this is a review for t-3. The only downer id say was the T-X, you dont look at her and think shes a terminator, unlike arnie, back to what hes best at, playing "" THE TERMINATOR"". People have moaned about there being too much comedy in this film, but come on with 3 billion deaths on the way, you need something to lighten things up a bit, Cameron would not have had the balls to end T-3 like that, he didnt even have the balls to make T-3, so mostow deserves more credit than hes being shown. Me personally i liked the storyline how everything linked up, i didnt watch it thinkin, oh thats a coincidence. i believed everything was down to fate. great film, enough said, 10/10",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
1072,benmandudeman,The terminator,10,5 December 2003,"This movie is the sequel to `The Terminator' and `Terminator 2.' The rise of the machines has more explosions, more action, and a better plot than the earlier two films. Terminator 3 `Rise of the Machines' is directed by Jonathon Mostow. The movie is about machines that look like people sent from the future to protect or kill John Connor (Nick Stahl). The machines are called terminators. The terminator that is sent back to keep John Connor alive is well acted by Arnold Schwarzenegger. The big difference with this movie is that the terminator is not just sent back in time to protect the beloved John Connor, but is there to protect Kate Brewster (Claire Danes). The reason is because Kate and John are supposed to get married in the future and later their children will become important to mankind.John Connor is important, because he is to protect the world from the machines. He becomes the leader of the people. On the day of the ending of the world, as we know it, is very close, and he will save the people that are left. The movie has another terminator called the T-X (Kristanna Loken). She is the perfect hot chick to play the part of a terminator. She is sent back in time to kill John Connor and all of his lieutenants. The plot has thickened; John and Kate must survive to ensure the survival of mankind in the future.

I own the DVD's and have watched them many times.There has been a trend over the last few years to substitute a well worked script for lots of actions shots and this film just about represents the pinnacle of this type of movie making. I was saddened by it. What a waste of an opportunity to finish off the series on a high note.As a technical achievement it is exceptional but the script is flat and lifeless. It seems that James Cameron's part in producing the script must have been very small or he's lost the plot. Add in second rate music (the first two having first rate music!) and the result is all gloss and no substance.Sure this type of film is all about a action but it does need a good script to work well. Just adding in bigger explosions and more carnage just ain't the way to do it.Such a disappointment, I really wanted to enjoy this film.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

My love for all things Ah-Nuld continues to this day. ""Rise Of The Machines"" definetly has flaws... but nothing overly glaring in my opinion (with the exception of the whole ""talk to the hand"" bit).Top notch action (no denying the utter sweetness of that first chase in downtown L.A.), impressive visuals, and a solid story. It may not have alot in the way of character development ... mainly because there's never much time for any of the characters to be sitting still for more than a few minutes.The feeling of this movie is very urgent. Lots of chasing and little to no pausing. Very quick pacing -- even more so than the other films in the series. Characters are ALWAYS in motion.I have been waiting since July 91 for another installment -- and I really believe this is a worthy entry in a great series of films. It may not be as memorable as the first two... but its still much more entertaining than alot of the action dreck that comes from Hollywood now-a-days.The Terminator - 8/10Judgment Day - 9/10Rise Of The Machines - 7/10",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
1079,deftone00000,A sad money making effort,3,7 January 2012,"The third film in the franchise would be quickly forgettable if not for it's ability to depress and disappoint fans of the originals. What feels like more of a spoof than a genuine addition to the previous films is full of genuinely unfunny ""jokes"", huge plot holes, and unimaginative scenes shamelessly recycled from James Cameron's previous work. Somehow the Director manages all of this while at the same time avoiding any thought provocation and emotional content, something viewers tend to overlook in the previous films, even despite the dark subject matter of impending nuclear holocaust, inevitable unchangeable fate (which in itself contradicts the message well delivered in the second film of free will and writing one's own future), soulless killing machines hell-bent on murdering individuals, etc. Indeed despite all these gripping themes (hijacked from the previous films and not the directors own work), the director only manages to present to us an uninspired ret-con of the story presented. Where before we are told the terminator cannot learn in order to limit his free will, the terminator in this film shows clear signs of learning and imagined ""wit"" as he spouts one liners in a way unfitting of a killing machine. I don't see this as actor Arnold Schwarzenegger, who clearly does his best to play his quintessential role in the face of terrible direction. This new terminator is presented as something to be laughed at in funny situations, as in the scene where he takes his clothes from the male stripper, and is somehow stripped of all that made him menacing even as the hero of the second film. The female villain of this film was full of emotion, sexiness, and wit, which only serves to discredit her as a terminator. She clearly enjoys killing, and her only defining feature is turning her arm into an assortment of guns, one trick to an otherwise unimaginative pony. John Connor neither resembles nor acts like he did in the previous film, and comes across as a loser. Despite this, he does somehow manage to expertly activate a particle collider in one bodged scene. His new romantic interest is of so little importance or character I won't waste your time writing about her.All in all, Terminator fans should probably avoid this disappointing film.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

1085,AsianMary88,The Terminator Trilogy is terminated,6,13 January 2007,"The Terminator, which was released in 1984 was spectacular for its time. Although, some of the special effects may seem outdated today, it is still an outstanding movie. It told the story of Sarah Connor and how her son would one day be the leader of the world resistance against the machines that have taken over the world, the last chance for human survival. A Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is sent back to 1984 to kill Connor before her son is born, but Kyle Reese (Michael Beihn) is also sent to protect her. It's a simple storyline, but it was still an effective movie. A sequel to this movie was inevitable, thus the spawn of Terminator 2: Judgment Day in 1991. The special effects were better and the story was expanded. This time around, the terminator once again played by Schwarzenegger, is the good guy to protect John Connor, now 13, and the T-1000 is sent to kill him. It was pretty much the same movie, but with bigger and better effects.Even still, both of those movies, directed by James Cameron, are one of the best sci-fi action movies ever made. Jonathan Mostow, director of Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines, could learn a thing or two from him. The original storyline was massacred. The entire theory that ""The future is not set"" is ignored. It is paraphrased in the opening as ""the future is still not written"", but the writers forgot about it because from the plot twist at the end, the nuclear war is inevitable. There is no stopping it. So, then, that means that the future is set and there really is no use in trying to change it. ""Fate is what we make of it"" no longer applies. The writers should've researched the previous Terminator films before starting on the third.What this movie lacks is James Cameron's direction. I give it a six out of ten stars only because of its action and the fact that the villain is now a hot and sexy female robot. I hear a fourth one is in the makings, and this is a mistake. Domestically, this film did not do well, so there is no hope for Terminator 4. I still like this movie because the action genre is my third favorite movie genre.

1086,Praseodymium59,Crap - to the Nth degree,5,5 December 2005,"OK well, there's not much i can say that hasn't already been posted. i'll not go into detail about all the obvious goofs and down right mistakes! i think everyone feels this film is a big let down in regards to the other films in the series, and i feel the same. i think it's how you feel no emotional connection to the characters, they're just there and gone. do big dramatic, emotional ending to the terminator, it just blows up and the film continues on. and another downfall, which i think was one of the biggest blunders of the film - the TX, an extremely advanced ""female"" terminator. first of all, a female terminator, nobody wants to see a female terminator being more advanced and stronger than arnie as the t-800. i mean, if this was all real life, i would say the T-1000 was a much deadlier enemy and could take down the TX (who seems rather stupid) no problem. but back to reality. i remember reading about this TX before the film was released and how it could reprogram other terminators and i was thinking, this is a great idea. but what became of it?- the TX reprogrammed the t-800 (which you didn't even see) and it came to get john with a very odd painful expression on its face, but ended up bashing that car to bits - WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT! i don't understand that bit, was it just trying to bash that car until his system was back to normal?? but i think the biggest mistake in this film (for me anyway) the part which when i saw it made some vomit actually come up into my throat was when in the convenience store he actually said - ""TALK TO THE HAND"" to the clerk. what the sh1t was that all about?! the terminator turns round and shoots the guy, thats whats meant to happen! or at least throws him or somethin! but i suppose that started when he was in the gay bar and he grabbed the guys hand and spoke to it. no bloody start to the film, like the other ones. sadly this is just a basic action film, with no depth. the only good part was the ending. i wont say stay away from it because I'm sure anyone who has seen the first two films will certainly have already seen this. so i'll end this by saying, this film only ralates to the other 2 films by name and by nothing else. i'm giving it 5/10. simply because for an action film it was alright.p.s. does anyone think Paul Verhoeven would direct a good Terminator??",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

The Terminatrix is an interesting addition to the series, some may say pointless and merely a backwards step, however this is not the case. The Terminatrix is a mixture of both the Terminator models from the first movies and has additional inbuilt weapons would do make for a more powerful enemy. However this is not very well executed and with more work and direction could have been an astounding piece of film folklore in a similar way to the T1000 from T2. The action sequences whilst fun, did not rival the impact of sequences past. This is primarily where the movie fails. With more focus these sequences could have been key in establishing the movie as a must see film. The music score is also passable at best. Whereas in T2 again, the music score built the tension up and made you feel that you were along for the ride as well. In this movie however, you will barely notice that it is there, this is a massive disappointment. The film also is very short, the previous two films being well over 2 hours, this goes little over 1 and a half and feels rushed. The ending of the film however is a shock to the system and a completely UN-Hollywood ending, a very good surprise which leaves the door open if necessary for another sequel. Overall, the ideas are good, with more work and care it could have stood out like its predecessors, however sadly it falls rather flat.

And, most of all, where do these slim robots carry all the fuel to fly, and all the ammo to fire continuously for 30 seconds? There is never any sign of a fuel tank nor ballistic cache. Will Hollywood please employ an engineer to design these devices instead of an SFX jockey; or worse, a director. As an actor of 35 years, I can faithfully tell you that directors make actors do really stupid things we cannot control unless wealthy enough to have point options. Even Liam Neeson, one of the greatest actors of the 21st century, has a hard time battling directors. Those who get their way: Sharon Stone (on the outs), Julia Roberts (considered mostly bi-polar), Dustin Hoffman (with no debate, he commands), Jeff Goldblum (ad-libbing since inception and basically playing the same Dustin Hoffman/Robert Blake ""Let me try to throw the other actor in the scene off balance so that I look great"" garbage -- Will Smith beat him in ID4). I can't tell you how many times that kind of sufferage has been pulled on me by another actor/actress. Jeff Goldblume deserves a kick-in-the-crotch lifetime award. Dustin Hoffman deserves a one-man show award. Really. Any performance the man has ever done was a one-man show and he needs to stop harasing the entertainment industry with his single-minded self hero worship. I tell you...; Robert Downey Jr is better than every actor. Truthfully. Drunk, stoned on crack, and a week without sleep, he is better than them all. Why do you think he keeps getting stoned? No challenge.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
1092,Marksd99,Metallic hell on earth,1,24 August 2006,"OK, so critically i'm forced to accept that my one star rating could be seen as maybe a bit harsh, the action was OK after all, the film looked pretty enough and the story was genuinely not as slap-dash and floored as we all dreaded it would be. As a stand alone film i could've genuinely forgiven this movie it's quirky sense of humor and cartoonish action sequences (that comedy 'DUNK' noise when Arnie is hit by a truck whilst riding the forklift truck is pure Wylee Kyote). However, that's where we hit the real meat of my problem with this movie, it's not just any random piece of action pie, it's the sequel to terminator 2, a film which even if you don't consider to be the greatest action movie of all time (which i emphatically do), everyone must agree had a certain iconic, macho appeal and tone. Now i accept that for a fairly unknown director, resuscitating such a beloved and successful franchise after such a long time must've been daunting, and i thoroughly expected to sit back in my comfortable cinema seat and watch with joy as the third terminator strained with mighty, piston-like muscles in an effort to avoid being crushed under the weight of its prequels. So you can begin to imagine my disappointment when rather than standing up to its prequels with its chest puffed out, T3 seemed rather to make a camp hand gesture and prance away. In short, my greatest problem with T3 is not that it isn't as good as its predecessors (i mean what is?), it's that it often feels like you're watching a spoofed remake, an impression not harmed by the fact that T3 'shares' most of its basic plot structure with T2. Case in point would have to be the scene in which the terminator seeks to acquire his trade mark leather jacket ensemble, although in previous films this simply seems to be the first outfit he found, in T3 it seems nothing else would do. You can almost hear the writers laughing and congratulating themselves at their sparkling wit, as the terminator is forced to regurgitate his iconic ""i need your clothes, your boots and your motorcycle"" line... to a male stripper. And the icing on the cake, when the 'unstoppable killing machine' walks outside and puts on the pair of pink, Elton john-style, star sunglasses: and the writers laugh, and the producers laugh and i die a little bit inside.However, the saddest thing i found, watching this movie was not the horrible, gimmick ridden plotting (ooo... lets make this evil terminator a girl!!!!!) that coated each scene, but the much broader plot-strokes that smashed into the terminator mythology like a certain hanging steel girder into a certain skull. Killing off Sarah Conner (the only woman ever created who could've kicked Lt. Ripley's ass) off screen no less, shifting the credit for saving mankind from John Conner (who's become a pussy instead of a super-soldier) to 'his wife?!?'. Its these massive blows that seem to have crippled a franchise that always seemed to have one last movie in it.However, i must freely admit that to most people this movie represents a small slice of action escapism that should warrant at least an hour and a half of you time if not your thoughts. But for me, and anyone else who bothered to learn to spell 'mimetic polyalloy' it's like watching a once proud bear being made to dance in a dirty tutu for the mild amusement of its owners.I always maintain that T2 was one of the saddest movies i've ever seen, at least in that way T3 managed to emulate it.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
1093,michaellm,wasted opportunity,5,30 December 2005,"Now this movie was alright. The action was good, the music had that terminator feel to it, and Arnold can still kick some ass. But the plot is starting to get old. Whiney John Connor is still complaining that his life sucks and that it is going to end with judgment day. Well duh!!! we figured that out in the last movie. Then there is the TX. My god, what a way to attract movie viewers. The director and writer must have been thinking ""this movie needs something raunchy, something hard core. Hey i know! BOOBIES. Even better, boobs in a hot tight leather jacket."" My friends came walking out of the theater saying the best part was when the bitches boobs expanded to a triple e cup. Plus the ending is sour.Everyoneknows judgment day is coming, why over dramatize it? Everyone knows that kate and john are going to win the war against the goddamn machines. This whole movie was a wasted opportunity. They should have gone with a whole new plot that involved something different than judgment day and a female terminator. So I am asking nicely directors and writers, if there ever is a T4, think about us, the fans, and how much we will despise you if you make another T3.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

A female (had to happen!) terminator who uses her breasts as means of distracting a policeman; talk of making out in the basement when they were (wait for it . . .) *teenagers* and apparently having made a good impression; seductively licking the blood off the victim in the vet's clinic; the right age for breeding . . . . need I go on?? Ugh . . . the American obsession with the boy girl thing in their movies is just so last year and so has been.Boring boring boring beyond belief. No attention or dedication to furthering the story - no, just a 15 minute fantasy thrill while Ms Blonde Hair and Big Knockers wreaks havoc, chaos and destruction on the streets with a vehicle crane.Even Arnie's delectably dry humour fell short as he tried to prop up a cast of amateurs and a weak story line and plot.A complete disaster.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

It has no need to have ever been made after terminator 2, which was good. The way they explain why the war wasn't stopped... really wasn't an explanation at all ""judgement day is inevitable"". Well, how scientific, i didn't know Jonathan Mostow put so much thought in to it there. Arnold acting in this is worse then usual, like you ever thought that possible. The CGI is credible, but not nearly enough to save this doomed film. After terminator 2, the story ended with a sense of ambiguity, almost to give the film a more realistic edge, what the screen doesn't show me, my mind makes it more powerful by imagining the outcome. The creation of this movie has ruined this mental picture, and ruined the last shred of Arnold Schwarzeneggers dignity. At least in the other films he was cool and hard, they ruined it by adding the comedy aspect (you all know what i'm talking about). Why did James Cameron let this complete idiot tamper with his finished project? There was no need for a third film, let it go. Do not see this film!!!",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
1096,t-janak,Confusing,4,2 March 2006,"... in the very sense of the word. Some jokes like ""talk to the hand"" are hilarious but the whole movie holds on to an aging Terminator, odd!Technically the film is great and the special effects are very good as well and to be honest, Kristina Lokken is easier on the eye than Arnie or the T-1000, but overall the film is weak and that is mainly due to the story itself. After the very successful sequel from 1991 all had been said, the world had been saved and this could have been a prime example of how not to spoil a good idea to bring the Terminator back once.Anyway, the damage is done!",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
1097,EnThRaSh,Great movie! A must see!,9,2 July 2003,"Well, saw it last night at my local megaplex and I must say, well worth the wait, and it was perhaps even better than T2.  This movie is one George Lucas needs to take some lessons from, there are LOTS of special effects in this movie but none of them detract from the movie, and none of them look obviously computer generated (such as 80% of SW I & II).This was one of those rare movies where the whole theater erupted in spontaneous cheers and laughter in a whole multitude of scenes which made the experience even more pleasurable.  Not to mention all the happy faces coming out of the theater on the way out, so I'm reasonably sure I'm not alone in my assessment that this is an awesome movie.Good story line, no ""give me a break!"", ""that's lame"", ""as if anyone would do that"" kind of scenes.  No 5 minute love story nonsense; this movie means to be an action movie and doesn't disappoint.  Humor thrown in at almost exactly the right points, as to not let things get too gloomy, and Arnold delivers the lines perfectly.Rating: 9/10",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
1098,beathead,Excellent,1,2 July 2003,"While the effects might seem a bit rushed the entire film rocks and rolls though some familiar Terminator territory.

1099,robford50,"Disappointing, Mr Mostow.",5,7 August 2003,"Let's cut to the chase, Terminator 3 is massively inferior to the two previous films.  And with a such a solid setup in place, Jonathan Mostow really must hold his hands up.  The problem here is the script, script, script.  I sat disbelieving as gag after gag rolled.  All very well, but this is a Terminator film, and regardless of the director's vision you have to respect what the previous films have set out, and by making the third film a comedy action flick, you're going to annoy a lot of fans 10 minutes in.  The third film has SO much scope - computers taking over the world killing billions of people in the process - yet after 109 minutes, you feel like not much has happened at all.  And that is unforgivable.  Arnie's Terminator is much less likeable, and has little chemistry with John Connor (the script doesn't allow much interaction).  It is a real pity Edward Furlong couldn't do this film, because he really had that strong personality coupled with vulnerability that made the Connor character his own.  Nick Stahl, as good an actor as he is, is just too wimpy and unassuming. The TX is a nice touch, but Robert Patrick's Terminator felt much more deadly.  But I guess that's the problem here: it just doesn't feel thoughtout at all - we need a decent plot to get back into feeling for Arnie and John Connor.  We need more than action sequences to fully feel what Judgement Day will look like.  Especially T2 did this - Cameron's film was brilliantly structured, and so simply scary.  You could feel the clock ticking towards armageddon.  So much happened in that film, by the end of it you felt like you were losing a friend when Arnie died, in this film you really feel little attachment to any of the characters.Overall, a disappointment.  This could, and should, have been a great finale, yet little in the way of intelligent plotting or characterisation leaves you with a cold feeling by the end.  I wanted to like this film, but Jonathan Mostow is getting into a habit of shooting slick films with potholed scripts.  Frustrating!",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
1100,Kram Sacul,Pretty good action movie but mediocre Terminator film,6,17 August 2003,While T3 does have some good ideas on the Terminator storyline it falls way short of the greatness of the first two.  Instead of introducing exciting original action sequences we get thinly disguised remakes of chases and scenes from mostly T2.  Instead of an original villain we get the female version of Robert Patrick's T-1000.  Instead of a strong complex female lead we have a frightened Clara Danes.  It's not all disappointing though. The conclusion is haunting and quite eerie.  I just wish the rest of the movie had that kind of emotional impact.,Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

Could have done with at least 10 extra minutes of character development, which would have added to the impact of several clever plot twists.Unfortunately, the vulnerability of Edward Furlong would have been better suited to the role of John Connor in this flick than the ""action figure/pretty boy"" features of Nick Stahl.

SFX are good and not over the top like other movies. I never thought Hollywood would ever come up with such a good ending, other directors should take great notice of this and learn. The cast is very good and the focus of the film is on John Connor and not on his mom like the two first ones were (T2 to a lesser extent) and it is truly a new chapter in the series. Furlong is not missed. Kristanna is doing a great job, she ain't something you wanna' play with :-D Clair and Nick are truly actors of high caliber and the bottom line is that Arnold is VERY good.

1107,txcheng,Not a worthy sequel.,7,3 July 2003,"T3 is more of an attempt to simply do a sequel for money. The plot line is fairly convoluted and seems more like the second part in a trilogy.Arnold is simply Arnold. He is okay, the action is as expected, lines seems more forced and the writing is not as witty as T2. Nick Stahl seems more like a TV actor and doesn't have the anger that Eddie Furlong portrayed in T2. Claire Danes does a decent job as his future spouse. Kristanna Loken as T-X is a little confusing as a character and a Terminator. Is she an improvement? She has more mechanical breakdowns than the T-1000 series. She is a babe. She tries to be icy like Robert Patrick did in T2, but to me she needs more training.My major beef about the movie is some obvious script flaws. Claire's father is in charge of an secret Air Force research lab and she along with John Conner and Arnold manage to simply waltz into this facility without even a glitch, loaded with weapons and explosives. Good security, especially in the times we live in now.The other downer is the end. How can the future be written in stone. I find this extremely unbelievable that not one thing all these people do, doesn't appear to change one thing in the future time line.

I have since decided on the former.  I went into the movie with a very hopeful yet skeptical attitude.  Ok, the movie.  At first I was afraid that my fears were coming true (the stupid sunglasses, talk to the hand - which actually was incredibly funny to me). The T-X made me quite sketical at first because she is so hot that I could not think of her being a mean ass. Then when she connects to the net through her phone I thought ""oh d*mn."" From then on out she is a bad*ss.  The chase through LA is hands down awesome.  Much better than the Matrix Reloaded chase (though not as long).  The Terminator is very good.  If a little more emotive than he should be.  Things about the movie that I really loved: Skynet coming online was so cool. There really wasnt much to it, but just knowing that it was happening was so cool. Conner realizing that judgement day cannot be averted was very good.  I also liked how the machines came to realize that just as judgement day itself could not be avoided, neither could John Conner, so instead they aim at the less important parts in an attempt to lessen the sum - the future generals that serve under Conner. At first I did not like how the movie ended, with the bombs dropping right at the end.  But in retrospect I think it was good that way.  However, it also necessitates another sequel.  I was sorta hoping for some closure.  But I was also itching to see everything blow up. Which also did not really happen.  But I guess that really was not all that necessary. There were a few other bad things.  First of all, there was just a little too much corny humor. Some would have been good, but not as much as was in there.  The sarah conner part was rather lame, in my opinion.  I wish they would have explained some more how the main players all happened to find there way together at the kennel.  The movie sorta throws out the whole ""no fate but what we make"" thing.  However, I think that is a good thing though. Lastly, I was hoping that Mostow would throw in something about Uncle Bobs left over arm at the end of T2.

Sit back with a big bucket of popcorn and soda and forget your life for two hours.  Enjoy it, it was fun and really entertaining if not a bit thought-provoking!I gave it an 8.  In reality, I would give it a perfect 7, but since so many people thought it sucked (since they expected it to be as good as T2), I had to overrate it by 1 star!",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
1126,jercasper,A decent movie,7,9 November 2005,"Though some fans did not like T3, I found it enjoyable, entertaining and not as insulting to the original films as some movie watchers seemed to find it. T3 had its definite cheesy moments (but so did the first two T-movies if one recalls! - T1 and T2 had some of the worst dialogue audiences should ever be forced to sit through - a Cameron trademark.)Though T3 contradicted some of the theories established in the first two films, all in all the contradictions were explained and they worked...This was a roller-coaster ride of a film and a lot of fun -- not as ""unintelligent"" as some reviewers would like readers to believe.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
1127,nhoj3,Surprisingly good...,8,3 July 2003,"Is this film as good as T1 and T2?  No.  Is this film a decent addition to the family?  Absolutley!Since this was just released, I'm going to do my best to write a review without giving much of the plot away.On the surface, there's not much new here from T2.  Arnold is back to defend John Connor from a shape-shifting terminator.  This one's tougher and sexier than Rober Patrick, but that has nothing to do with this positive review... :)First and foremost, I liked how they continued the story.  After T2, I wasn't sure how they could extend the existing plotline while remaining believable.  I love the set-up for Connor, the new mission for both terminators, the twists along the way, and the revelation at the end.Furthermore, I was impressed with what Nick Stahl did with the part of Connor.  He had some pretty cliche lines to deliver from time to time, but his portrayal made me care about him.Jonathon Mostow has a great eye for action sequences, and has done an admirable job at the very unenviable task of following up a James Cameron classic.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
1128,Freakz,Why it's the best.,9,4 August 2003,"This is one awesome movie. You get an 5 min. introduction to where we are, who's in it and then it all begins. The plot might be a little on the thinner side of what people might expect, but the action, funny antics, that only is possible in the movie because of what became cool in it's preceding movies. The whole strip club scene is hilarious. The new way they use the fact that Arnold is playing a robot also makes for some funny scenes. Then there is the fight scenes and the spectacular car chase. well just mind blowing action made Matrix style... you'll remember it even if you dont want to.This movie is nothing like T1 or T2 and it dose not really matter. T1&T2 is history and they made this third chapter in such a manner that it dose not ruin anything of the past two. You can watch the first 2 and complete ignore the third because it begins a new story line of it's own. You can even watch the third movie without knowing much of the former two.
The plot, characters etc may be in the low end of the scale... But dang it was entertaining to watch.. twice :Dblah blah bad English etc my opinion... :]",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
1129,juliuso,Ahhhnold's Back!,7,1 July 2003,"T3 was a decent film despite the fact that I entered the theater with the false pretense that Mostow would be able to imitate Cameron's style in T1 and T2.  The only reason I could see the need to have a Terminatrix was for the sex appeal.  Had Robert Patrick (T- 1000) been brought back, the film would've been equally good, if not better. There were definitely some moments where Ahnold's one-liners were just hilarious. I would've liked to have seen a slightly stronger ending.  You'll never forget Sarah Connor driving off into the desert, or Ahnold sticking up his thumb as he's getting submerged in the hot steal.  But nukes being launched everywhere?Not sure if this will conclude the Terminator legacy, but if they do make another one, I'll definitely go see it.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
1130,sxxxyboy11,"Good, but shows how amazing terminator 2 is",8,1 July 2003,"I saw Terminator 3 tonight and I msut say that it was good.  I was somewhat dissapointed by it since T2 set such high standards, but it was nonetheless a very solid movie.  T2 was made in 1991 with a budget of 100 million.  To me this movie still holds its ground to T3, a movie made 12 years later. Cameron's presence was missed on this film, but Mostow did a job well done and can hopefully spawn a sequel of two off this story line.  Although not as good as T2 it keeps the franchise alive and the story provides more than enough interest for another movie.8/10",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
1131,ueykgqbmsjlxtf,A Total Failure,4,17 January 2007,"Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is, quite frankly, a failure.Let us start with the inferior special effects: Given that the film cost 187 million dollars to make, one would expect superior quality special effects, or, at least, high quality. However, it was not delivered.A terminator exists for one purpose: to kill. It is relentless, brutal, and every feature of its design is meant to facilitate more efficient killing. As a special effects artist, one should create imagery that captures this idea... So.. my question is... how exactly will those glowing lights help a terminator kill??? both terminators have an EXCESSIVE amount of glowing, Christmas-tree like features. the T-101 has red and green lights inside its chest, and the T-X is practically a walking blue LED. It reminds one of geeky PC with UV lights rather than a killing machine.we will also note that the T-X comes with tiny a rotary saw!! i mean, come on!! the giant stabbing sword of t-1000 provided a much better visual representation of brutality. Big, sharp, pointy objects looks menacing, blurry round things doesn't, especially when it's about 2 inches in diameter and comes with the sound FX of a dentist's drill.the physics is horrible as well, in the hand-to-hand combat scene, the T-X manage to throw T-101 for 10 meters without moving back an inch. And no, it doesn't make T-X look strong, it makes the entire scene look artificial, like a bad kung-fu movie. There is also a scene where the T-101 pulls open the door of a safe: not only is that physically impossible (if it were a real safe one most most likely pull the entire safe out of the wall) but the scene also fails to convey the message that the terminator is strong. To covey strength visually, one need to establish visually that 1) something is difficult to do and 2) the character does this difficult thing, so he/she is strong. Throughout the film the terminators perform feats of strength way too effortlessly, which takes away the realism. (in comparison, Robert Patrick's hand to hand fight scene in T2 was much much better.There are two more scenes that bugs me visually. One is the scene where T-X sends electric signals to police cars. the computer generated graphics looks like something from the 1980's. the other scene is where cathrine bruster shot T-101 and T-101 spits out the bullet. If i had designed that scene i would have had the bullet tear off a large chunk of T-101's cheek, making a wound that looks like a menacing grin while revealing its metal mandible, or better yet, tear off a piece of T-101's eye.. or, at the very least, show some blood... but nooo.. the T-101, simply catches the bullet with its mouth.. like.. some parlor trick... sigh..Aside from the special effects problem, there are script problem as well.. ill place humor is a huge problem in this movie.T-101 saying ""talk to the hand"" is just not funny.T-101 wearing star shaped sun-glasses.. not funny either...T-101 saying ""excuse me"" to T-X: not funny.cathrine bruster punching T-101 in back the same way that most girls punch guys when they are flirting with them: what is this: a romantic comedy? T-X saying ""i like your car"" ""i like your gun""... just plain weird.T-X breast enlargement: serves no purpose. (she was gonna kill the cop anyway, not like there is a NEED for deception and doing things for no apparent purpose destroy the whole image of the Sparthan, cold blooded killing machine.) T-X always walking like she was on a catwalk.. neither funny, nor sexy, nor cool, nor menacing.T-X having a strange curious look before using her remote control ability: just plain weird to see cold blooded killing machine with the look of curiosity! In short.. the film sucks...",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
1132,Starving_Screenwriter,No fate but what we make or inevitability?,8,1 July 2003,"I've loved the first two (especially the second) Terminator movies ever since I can remember.  I was only six years old when I saw the first one. This was because my parents left us with a babysitter who was not supposed to show us the film, but did anyway.  If I still knew who that man was I would thank him today because at age six I was scared of the Terminator but loved Arnold Schwarzenegger.  He is still my favorite actor today.In the first two, the story is very similar, but the second movie gets deeper in thought.  The quote, ""There is no fate but what we make for ourselves"" was a theme, so to speak, and it worked well.  The machines sent a Terminator through time to change what the future had brought. Apparently John Connor is supposed to be the leader of the human race, and the machines feel he is going to be there demise.  Since he is such a powerful leader in the future, they feel it be best to go back in time to destroy him before he becomes such an influential and strong man.  In each movie the Terminator fails, but the machines appear to become more advanced (since model 101 was replaced with 1000 from the first to the second).  At the end of T2, we get the idea that it must be the end, and Judgment Day was no longer in the world's future.Enter Terminator 3.  The ""theme"" in this movie is almost a contradiction to T2's theme.  (semi-spoiler)  The Terminator explains to John that Judgment Day is inevitable, and that John's fate is to become the leader of the human race.  Therefore no matter what they do Judgment Day is still going to happen.  The one thing that confused me was the fact that there was still a Terminator sent back to try and destroy John Connor.  If the future is inevitable, then why send a machine back when they know it's not going to work?  Maybe the idea that the future happens only one way is not true, but rather just a speculation.  Whatever the outcome may be, the machines do realize the importance of John Connor and will try almost anything to terminate him.The end of the movie was great, and I was quite amazed and shocked at it. I wasn't expecting it at all, but loved it just the same.  The movie is also great because it lives up to the Terminator name.  The special effects are mind-blowing and the scenes are intense.  If you liked T2, you should definitely not wait to see this one.  Besides, you want to see the fourth one as well, don't you?  You decide, is it fate or inevitability that Terminator 4 will be in our future?",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
1133,jp267,The T-1000 would Destroy the T-X,7,8 February 2007,first of all im a die hard terminator fan i have been since i saw T-2 when i was 5 i saw T3 in theaters i thought it was OK i was expecting something a little better but anyways what i don't get is why they would send something less advanced than the t-1000 the T-x is cool (and hot) don't get me wrong but the thing is an anti-terminator and if she would try to attempt to terminate the t-1000 she would fail because she would shoot him with that ray gun she has and it would go through him and the t-1000 would basically do what he did to the T-800 (arnie) in the end of T2 which is completely F@#K him up so yeah thats what i really didn't like about that movie does anyone else agree?,Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
1134,DRLanth,Shocked by how much I enjoyed this.,9,3 July 2003,"As has been said time and time again, I went in with a low expectation, and came out blown away by how good of an action film this was. I could go into a detailed commentary on the film, but instead I think I'll just make a few points. The comedy was definately over the top at times.  Frankly I loved it. Some have critiqued the TX's design as being more primitive than that of the T1000.  These people may be forgetting the T1000's drawback.  The T1000 can not transform itself into a weapon.  It can't form projectile weapons out of itself.  By combining the liquid metal with an android skeleton, we come up with an interesting mix.  It can repair itself in the manner of the T1000, albeit it with some limitations.  However, it gains the ability to create weapons out of itself.  That arm cannon was absurdly powerful.  The flamethrower was a tad weak I'll admit, but that was a secondary attack. Something I want to note that I don't think many people pick up on in T2. When Arnold is lowered into the molten steel, the chip and arm from the first movie were destroyed.  Interestingly though, when Arnold was lowered, he had one arm.  The other arm was ripped off by a gear.  That arm was left behind, in the gear.  This is just a theory of mine, but I always wondered what happened to that arm.  Interestingly, on the general's desk we find a metal Terminator hand.  Could there be a connection here? I did want to briefly comment on the death of Sara Connor's dream that the future is something we can create out of free willed choice, and not deterministic.  It's sad to think that everything is predestined to happen in a certain way.  I hope in the next installment of this franchise, which now seems to be a certainty, that they find a way to return free will to the story. The idea of Skynet being software as opposed to some sort of mainframe was very intriguing.  It makes the reference to Pandora's Box by the general much more compelling.  There was literally no way to put Skynet back in the box after it was unleashed.  There are several versions of the Pandora's Box myth.  In one version, only one virtue is left within the box, without which humanity would surely have been crushed by all the evils it had unleashed. Hope.  Hope here is personified in the form of John Connor and Kate Brewster. I'd give this film.. oh.. 4.5/5.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

1136,mp3_dd,Arnold Delivers!,9,2 July 2003,"Wow, just got back from Arnold's new flick, or perhaps it's not only Arnold's: wonderful to see him finally again sharing the screen with other actors. The film truly delivered, it was action packed, yet, unlike the matrix, the action was remarkably realistic (as realistic as you can go with robots from the future). Arnie was in his old form: fewer lines, more punching, and yes he was funny... Almost all of his one-liners worked with the crowed, and yap, a number of times the theater burst out laughing. The plot was strong, and while it wasn't adventurous by having too many side plots, it delivered, and stayed strong through out the movie.Performances were excellent: John Connor (Nick Stahl) was strong and convincing, Arnie was Arnie , and TX (Kristanna Loken) was hot yet managed to stay scary... The only major actor who I was not really positive about was Kate Brewster (Claire Danes) they tried to replace John's mom with a new face, but I think they should have dropped that personality from the story...Special FX were well done, but not over done... They left off from the old T2, and managed to have the same combination of CGI effects and real effect (i.e. explosions) in a very convincing fashion, quiet amazing... However, while T2's effects were groundbreaking, T3's were just plain excellent...Finally the ending sequence and the twist, were unexpected and positive, and in my honest opinion left the crowed very happy.The movie wasn't as smooth as T2, and probably could best be compared to ease of transition to The Transporter and Bourn Identity, the best recent action films I could think of.Overall the film was a surprise, I expected eye candy, and I certainly got it, but the strong preferences and compelling plot elevated it to the top action film in recent memory. So anyone who can enjoy an action film should see this one!8.5/10",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

1139,dops,So much better than expected,9,14 July 2003,"I was of the school of thought that this film was going to be terrible. Arnie was too old; Jim Cameron wasn't on board; Nick Stahl was in Disturbing Behaviour! These are the sorts of things an ordinary movie could not get over.T3 is not ordinary.The action sequences are spectacular, even more so because they are (take note Wachowski's and Lucas) REAL! Obviously some CG effects were used but it wasn't entirely CG (which might have worked for Neo) and that in itself was a treat.The director builds a real sense of pressure and a real sense of style right up until the decidedly non-Hollywood ending, which even its predecessor did, the direction is just on the right side of post-modern irony and the performances (bar one) are great.This leads us nicely onto the big man himself... Mr. (Governor?) Schwarzenegger is now 56 years old, he first played the T-100 in 1984 and he has progressed through the years into a different actor to when he started.  All in all a tough assignment! He manages to just make us believe he is the T-100 again, it's amazing.  I forgot he was Arnie; all I knew was that if he wanted to he could have snapped John Connor's neck like a twig (good thing if Edward Furlong was involved).Just for fairness though I must point out what I thought the weak link was Kristanna Loken, now before anyone starts I have nothing against models-turned-actors but in this case Miss Loken should have kept her mouth shut and her legs waxed.  She is just not Robert Patrick, she doesn't ever have the sense of malice that he managed to put into the T-1000 and for that she fails.Anyways that's my quick review; I do recommend you go see the film when it comes out over here you really won't be disappointed",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
1140,BrokenToasters,"Falls short of T1, way short of T2",6,2 July 2003,"I went into this movie hoping to be surprised if not downright delighted at what I was seeing.  I had hoped that it wouldn't be just another Hollywood big budget sequel that falls short of anything above average.  I was, however, very disappointed with what I saw.  It was just another Hollywood sequel that had little to add to the first two movies.I was not, however, totally put off by the film.  There were some excellent sequences that deserve the proper recognition.  The crane chase was creative and entertaining.  A few other ideas that I won't mention were good, along with the introduction to skynet, but these were not enough.  I didn't feel the same intensity that T2 brought me, or the sense of originality that T1 gave to me.The movie runs short, less than two hours.  The dialogue seemed a little cheap.  But worst of all, the story was second rate.  For as much money as they spent, they could make sure everything is excellent, not just the special effects.  If you want nonstop action, by all means see this movie. If you want a thought provoking epic, look elsewhere. 6/10",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

It has more plot than T1, or T2 combined.The lack of Cameron does not bother me at all.  It also has several twists that give it more depth than the previous Terminator movies.  The special effects were great, well above the Matrix movies if you ask me.  CGI use was nice and not overdone.Arnold is back in top shape for this one as well.  I really hope we see a T4.  I think it was not a good time to release T3.  My theatre was pretty empty on Friday night (the 4th of July).  I think a lot of people were out to other Holiday parties.

1143,superfurryraptor,Silly and Monotonous,4,2 July 2003,"First off I must confess that I'm not a member of the church of Terminator. I was 5 years old when T2 came out and I missed out on all the hype and excitement surrounding its release. The first time I saw T2 was right before watching T3; I had seen the first movie before. On DVD and 12 years separated from the hype, T2 is a decent action movie but nothing more; I found James Cameron's attempts at creating human drama to be just as laughable as they were in Titanic. Because I wasn't really anticipating this movie, it wasn't a big deal to me when it turned out to be a dud (especially considering I got in free thanks to an employee friend's passes). If you are a fanboy, brace yourself; I haven't seen anything quite so hilarious and sad for quite some time as the shell-shocked, horrified look on the face of a man in the row behind me at the end of the movie; as everyone filed out, he stayed glued to his seat, his mouth slightly open, staring transfixed at the screen like it was some horrible train-wreck. I have a creeping suspicion he was praying for Ashton Kutcher to appear and scream ""YOU'VE BEEN PUNK'D BY THE PUNKERS ON MTV'S PUNK'D, PUNK!""Before 1999, action movies were about big, brutal fights and explosions. On March 31, 1999, The Matrix slipped quietly into theaters and we all know what happened next. For better or for worse, T3 is a throwback film of sorts. There is, as in Matrix Reloaded, one huge car-chase set piece; it plays out more like director Jonathan Mostow challenging himself to see how much of the ridiculous $170 million budget he can spend blowing things up and knocking things over in a couple minutes, all while shaking the camera around and cutting quickly enough that you have only a faint inkling of what's going on. All the movie's action sequences play out like this; yes, the explosions are big, but none of it is terribly interesting or creative.I'm not going to bother with the plot, which serves as a vehicle for 1) the effects and 2) the setup for a couple more of these movies than a story in its own right. What some will inevitably call a daring and imaginate shakeup of the Terminator mythos is more a necessarily overcomplex way to milk an artificial conflict out of a storyline that was concluded 12 years ago.This is a franchise exercise and a calculated move, not a film. If that doesn't dissuade you from seeing it, since 90% of Hollywood's movies are that way, hopefully the fact that it's a bad one will.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

I had a feeling that Hollywood was trying to milk an old, tired cash cow, but boy was I wrong.  It's not quite as good as T2, but not much is. The Terminator story continues on as the machines begin their rise to power. This flick is full of action, including one chase scene that rivals the now legendary chase in The Matrix Reloaded, ridiculous gun shoot outs and brief comedic moments that Terminator fans are used to.  Arnold gives a great performance as the T-101 again and the new ""Terminatrix"" chick is unbelievably hot, even though the nude appearance scene was a little too ""PG-13"" for me.

1146,Showdownxfo5,"When movies stop being about art, and start being about money.",1,14 January 2008,"***This comment is one gigantic spoiler, so brace yourself*** Firstoff I've been a huge Terminator fan since I was the age of 6. I love both films and they're in my Top 3 of movies of all time (Along with The Godfather, and Goodfellas) Now this T3 comes along, and it's supposed to be a bigger more Badass Terminator than we already know. Rather than give my review, I'm going to give you a play-by-play of how this movie starts from my point of view.This movie starts off, no Terminator Theme, no frightening yet mysterious visions of fire, just a black screen with the casts names up there. After a minute of agonizing nothingness, we hear John Connor speak. Now this isn't the rebellious, ""Doesn't give a damn,"" ""Leader of the Resistance"" John Connor we know and love. No-no-no that would be too cool. Instead he hear the first words of what would later be found to be a whiny little brat that could couldn't lead a dog to a can of Alpo. His first words are ""No Fate but what we make for ourselves"" (an idea that was presented to us in the first 2 films, but after getting into this 'film', we'll soon realize that James Cameron's idea will be sh-t all over, and it's ass will be wiped with dollar bills.) After we hear him yap for a while, we cut to a CGI nightmare of the future. This scene is the first major rip-off of the first 2 films, the difference is the original version (again, I remind you that it was made in 1984) looked 10x better.Fast forward a few minutes (I mean this movie has to get better,) And we see the classic scene where The Terminator arrives. Only this time it looks like a bad comic book. It literally looks like a parody of the originals. And do we get a tough, bad-ass, gives your children nightmares Terminator ? No-no, again, that would be too cool. We get some Victoria Secret model with neat hair, perfect make-up, and motherly eyes. The overdone CGI, which include the manikins melting and a 'cool' grid that surrounds the time portal is just enough to make me sick to my stomach. After she steals a car (it's a Lexus, by the way if you didn't see the 8 foot, million dollar logo) she makes a call on her (Nokia) cellphone and identifies her 8 targets. Blah-blah, runs red light, cop car, Victoria's Secret ad, boobs, likes cops gun.If that weren't enough of a slap in James Cameron's face, this will be. We see Arnold stroll into a Bar, just like in T2. But get this, it's not a Biker-bar this time, it's...he-he...I can't stop laughing while typing this...it's... a male strip club! And they all think Arnold is a male stripper he-he! While ""Macho Man"" is playing in the background, Arnold spots clothing that fit him...and get this...they're on a Stripper! Who would have guessed!? BRILLIANT writing. After quite possibly the gayest exchange I've ever seen in a movie (and I've seen Brokeback mountain,) I'm wrong yet again. Apparently the writers thought it would be funny if The Terminator, the same guy who mercilessly shot the wrong Sarah Connor in the face, and tried to run the real one down with a Mac truck...wore pink Elton John sunglasses. Why again did Arnold agree to this ? (Oh yea, 30 million big ones) You can literally hear the writers laughing to themselves. Only it's not a normal laugh, it's one of those geeky, nasally, Steve Urkel laughs. Next scene: How did he remember to look in the sun visor for keys when John taught to the other Terminator? I'm not going to even go into this movie any further, because I honestly feel like I'm losing braincells writing a review for it. In summary, this movie is a joke. An unfunny caricature and borderline parody of, arguably, 2 of the greatest films ever produced. Lets see if the Sarah Connor Chronicles, and T4 can clean up the mess that T3 has made for the franchise.One star.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

The TX was awesome!!!  The best scenes were when she was fighting Arnold.  I would recommend this movie.

I believe it surpasses it's expectations. Compared to The Terminator and T2, T3 is action-packed to the bone. Props go to the special effects team. I knew the action in the movie would be incredible. What I was concerned about coming into the theater was whether the plot would be strong or weak. After all, in T2, Judgment Day is prevented. Or is it? We learn early on in the movie that it's only delayed. The war with the machines is inevitable. The plot is complex but understandable. It's not like The Matrix Reloaded. Too keep things short and sweet, T3 spells the sad truth about mankind. The ending brings a tear to the eye. It made me think about how fragile life is. ""The future is not set. There is no fate but what we make for ourselves."" Think about it. Then go see T3.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

1150,Ciaron212,Exciting summer flick,8,4 July 2003,"I just saw the Matrix Reloaded. It was humorless, pseudo-intellectual, needlessly complicated, and the fight scenes were tensionless and too long. I didn't like it. So it was nice to see T3 was the exact opposite. Though it started out a little slowly, there were plenty of humorous moments, the plot was simple (supposedly there were continuity issues with the other movies, but even though I saw T2 twice, I didn't notice), the actions scenes were well done, and there were even moments of real emotion. As long as you accept T3 for what it is -- an action movie with no depth -- you will thoroughly enjoy it.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
1151,i_am_matty,Terminator as it should be!,9,2 July 2003,"(I will try to write this review without giving away any of the plot, which is particularly difficult because the story was very original).Finally, a hollywood movie that didn't show everything in the trailers. This movie looked borderline for me.. but I am a loyal Sci-Fi Guy so I had to see it, and I wasn't disappointed.  The trailers for this film were uniamiously bad, just your typical action/Arnold-with-a-rocketlauncher, unoriginal shoot-em-up.  What this film ended up being was a delight in acting (notably Nick Stahl as John Connor) and Claire Danes(when is she bad), story, and cinematography.The story really moved along, although it was the typical: chase John, John escapes, Re-acquire John, chase John, John escapes.  The movie felt complete in a way in which the previous installments never really did.  I left the movie satisfied, but not in the typical Hollywood fuzzy way, but in a deeper meaningful understanding way... I would like to think I'm not reading too much into ithis film but everyone I was with totally agreed.I would recommend this movie to any Sci-fi/Action movie fans.. and maybe even some Drama lovers who just want a touch more adventure.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
1152,anagendra,Arnie's Best performance ever,8,3 July 2003,"Except for a few scenes, where the art direction is not up to the ""Terminator series"" class,  the movie has excellent entertainment value. The movie has got excellent special effects and minimal chit-chat as in the 2 prequels. The Terminatrix ""Kristanna Loken"" has done a decent job, but this was clearly the best performance by Arnie after a long time. Nick Stahl and Claire Danes are not very impressive, but we have to keep in mind that all the action is packed in just 1:48 hrs. The movie ends well with all bases covered. All in all, a perfect action movie with more new and funny one-liners!!",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

The action is non-stop and surprisingly it had a wonderful story. Arnie of course was just simply great as the terminator, althought this time he mad much more humour that the previous terminators. The rest of the cast did their roles accordingly. The highlight of this movie is seeing Arnold back and the dream is just watchin one of the greatest action movie franchises back. I love good action movies, and none is greater than T2, and watching T3 in this day, where they don't make good movies, it was beautiful to see a movie like this. Arnie is the kick of Action and the Terminator is his gateway to pure mayhem. A must see Movie. ****",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

1155,ChristianB72-1,Underhyped but over-rated,6,7 July 2003,"Terminator 3 is a prime example of what I'd call underhype/over-rate syndrome.  We all saw the awful trailers, we all heard about the troubled production history, and we all knew that James Cameron & Linda Hamilton wouldn't be involved.  Suffice it to say, no one I knew thought this movie was going to be very good.  I held out hope that I'd see a reasonably entertaining action movie.That's exactly what I saw, . . . barely.  However, I think that the fact that the movie came with such low expectations, has somehow raised a lot of people's opinions of a very mediocre film (73% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes).But enough about other people's opinions, lets get to mine.  I watched Terminator 3 with a smile throughout most of it. It wasn't a big goofy smile, or a wide-eyed look of awe or shock, but a pleasant, mildly amused smile.  I left the theater entertained, but I almost immediately began to forget the movie I just saw.I started to think about why my reaction was so luke warm.  I think I can boil it down to this: There wasn't one moment in the movie that thrilled or surprised me.  For a Sci-Fi action movie, let alone the 3rd installment in a series, that's a fatal flaw in my book.  Where did it go wrong? Here's my breakdown:CHARACTERS: - T101 - Great to see Arnold back as the T-101, I actually liked him better here than I did in T2.  He has a couple of funny lines, but like the rest of the film they are mildly amusing and instantly forgettable. - John Connor - Nick Stahl is less annoying than Edward Furlong but not anymore interesting.  He's actually quite bland and didn't generate empathy for his character. - Kate Brewster - Claire Danes manages to make her more empathetic and engaging than John Connor, but the two characters have zero chemistry together.  Any human drama that might have made the movie more interesting is lost by this fact. - TX - A sorry substitute for Arnold in the 1st film and Robert Patrick as the T-1000 in the 2nd.  She doesn't pull out any awe-inspiringly cool tricks like the T-1000 did, and her stone-cold-menace factor pales in comparison to the T-1000 as well as Arnold in the original.  Granted she had two pretty tough acts to follow, but if the film makers insisted on telling basically the same story for the 3rd time, they had to make up in style and cool effects what they sacrificed in lack of originality and predictability.Which brings us to STORY: I liked the 1st 2 terminator films, I didn't need to see them AGAIN during the 1st hour of this film.  The first hour had no tension or suspense because I'd seen it all before, and we knew none of the main characters would be killed by the TX anyway.  Had there been any spark of originality here it may have sustained my interest more than it did.  During the last half hour, the story finally goes somewhere new, but by that time even these late developments are utterly predictable.DIRECTING: Serviceable job by Jonathan Mostow, the action scenes are well structured, and the character scenes are watchable enough.  However the framing of the images doesn't compare with the stylistic touch James Cameron displayed in T2.WRITING: The dialog was succinct and to the point. No groan inducing lines, but nothing I'd call witty either.ACTION: A lot of people have apparently been wowed by the chase scene involving a crane driven at high speed while ripping up half the city. I'll say this for this scene, it's loud, and it certainly must've been expensive.  Again, there is absolutely no tension in this scene, and visually it is not as impressive as say the highway chase in Matrix Reloaded. I've seen plenty of chase scenes in my time, and a great many of them were better than this one. A fight scene between the two terminators towards the end of the film fares much better, mostly because (gasp!) I didn't know how it was going to end, and because the film makers wisely avoided the use of CGI stuntmen for the most part. You could really feel the weight of the metal crashing against the environment in this scene.EFFECTS: Like I said before, this film has basically nothing original story, character, or action-wise, putting a great burden on the effects to offer something to keep us interested. The result is ho-hum, although I must commend the restrained use of CGI during action scenes (a practice that has cost many other movies the suspension of disbelief from their audiences).So to summarize, T3 is a mildly fun action flick.  If that's all your looking for, by all means T3 will do the job.  Just don't be suckered by the under-hyping into thinking this a great film that's come to rescue the summer. As a fan of the series I liked where the story ended up, but the journey there was at times an exercise in mind numbing predictability.My Rating 6/10",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
1156,bytor-5,The tradition of great SFX continues,8,1 July 2003,"The latest installment of the Terminator movies will not only thrill fans, but also impress the casual viewer. Time isn't wasted on useless sentimentality as this movie kicks into action from the very beginning. Schwarzenegger reprises his role to perfection and thankfully keeps the cheesy one-liners to a minimum.Although it is noticeably missing the James Cameron touch, director Jonathan Mostow certainly delivers a quality picture worthy of becoming part of the trilogy. Some bad acting and poor writing hinder this from being a perfect film, but that was almost to be expected. Still, experience T3 on the big screen along with great sound, and you won't be disappointed.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

The acting was great, although Kristanna Loken was a bit of a downer, she could've been better. The story took the T franchise into a whole new direction. Lemme also say that as an Arnold fan AND a HUGE T fan, I was never skeptical of this movie. It's not as PG-13 friendly as most of you people think either, at one point the TX shoves her arm through a guy's back and out the other side, I won't say who though since I'm not one for spoilers.

I do believe that ""T2"" is the best installment in the series then i would say T3 then the first Terminator.  Alot of people will disagree with me on how I rate the movies in that order.  Terminator 3 did not have as much drama as the first two but it still had its fair share. The action sequences were great and the story was well told. Arnold gives a great performance as the terminator.  The T-X was on the same level as the T-1000 as the villan.  T3 was a solid entry the series and a must see for Terminator fans and action fans.  Also i say it was better than the Matrix Reloaded.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
1159,Vermillion,Best Film of the Summer,9,1 July 2003,"This movie is by far the best film released since the ""Summer"" began. It doesn't get as heady as The Matrix Reloaded, and its action has a more purposeful feel, rather than the destruction-for-destruction's sake of The Hulk.The actors suit their roles perfectly. Arnold hasn't aged a bit since T2, and the T-X is a refreshing change from the T-1000. John Conner is well played by Nick Stahl and Claire Danes as Kate Brewster does a very decent job in her part.My only complaint in the James Cameron v. Johnathan Mostow debate being that Mostow seemed to opt for a few too many slow-mo shots for dramatic effect. Other than that minor issue, I really think Mostow did a fine job of following Cameron's T2. There is a good amount of ""tasteful"" humor, too.As for the story, the formula is much the same as T2 -- for the most part. Our Terminator is dispatched to stop the T-X who was programmed to kill John Conner and his commanders. There are enough plot twists to keep you interested without delving into melodrama. The whole plot is just believable enough (all things considered) to entertain.My main complaint is that the musical score for T3 uses nothing of Brad Fiedel's awesome score for the previous films. There is a redux of the ""Terminator"" theme nearer to the end, but I feel the lack of Fiedel's cold, mechanical themes detracted from an otherwise perfect action film. The movie has many great throwbacks and references to the prior films so the omission of such great themes was a pretty big disappointment for me. Overall a great action film, and the best yet for this Summer.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

I honestly believe this movie is very good. Yes some of the jokes were really lame, like the talk to the hand thing, but many other complaints people have with the movie are unjustified. People have been complaining that Nick Stahl acted ""lost"" in the movie. Yet that was an element of his character. Even Arnold who's now around 60 was great. Claire Danes who doesn't do many action movies was wonderful in the movie. Not to mention Loken, who is amazing, acted her part pretty well. I'm not arguing that this movie is the best terminator. Yes we all know that Cameron is a great director, but Mostow is one too. The action and story are amazing. People have been complaining about how the movie doesn't require enough thought, but seriously the third time around I think everyone understands the concept by now. There wasn't much need to explain the war. Terminator 2 did that great. This movie is an excellent movie that I believe will make an excellent addition to the terminator series. My only concern is that in order to milk the franchise, future movies will begin to suck. Let's just hope I'm wrong. WATCH THIS MOVIE!!!!",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
1164,MsCarla21,A good fun movie,10,28 November 2003,"Well its no Terminator 2 Judgement day which still rates as the best of the trilogy, but its still a good film.  I think why I personally like it so much as it completes the movie cycle.  In the first film we when shown glimpses of a possible future and same in T2, but in the closing momments of T3, we see the cycle complete as the Skynet takes over and starts the nuclear holocaust.My favorite moment has to be the ending, in the 2nd film we had hope for the future, and up until the end of T3 we had the same hope.  All that changes the moment they realise that they are in a bunker.  I personally felt the angst as they knew that there was nothing they could do to stop Skynet.  I had tears in my eyes as the missiles launched and we saw humanity reduced to shreds, it was a powerful emotional ending.  Director Jonathan Mostow should be congratulated for a risky ending which works.In order that we can enjoy the first two movies, this ending which was a total shock has to happen.  The script I confess is a little weak and it does lack James Camerons magic touch, but i did enjoy the film and I really think its a good one to end the series.  I love the terminator movies but I think it should end here.I personally rate 3.5 out of 5, not the best but still a good movie.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

The TX was bland and she was no where near the level of the T1000 played by Robert Patrick. The ending was okay I suppose but was it done so that another T film can be made ? I think it was. This vehicle should have finished after the 2nd film and it is now going down the route of other classics such as Jaws, Rocky, Rambo where the original films were really good but Rocky 2 and T2 apart the subsequent sequels just got worse and worse.

Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines succeeds where so many sequels fail: in originality. With the movie's star cast, fantastic action sequences and impressive story, it's not hard to guess that T3 will go down in film history as one of the most engaging action/sci-fi movies ever created.T3 focuses on John Connor (Nick Stahl), leader of the human resistance against the machines in a futuristic war-torn planet Earth. John, having stopped judgment day 12 years ago with the help of T-101 (Arnold Schwarzeneggar), has broken off all contact with the world and has become a drifter, knowing deep down that judgment day is still near. A new terminator, the T-X (Kristanna Loken) is sent into the present to kill John Connor and his future lieutenants. The story also involves Katherine Brewster (Claire Danes), a veterinarian's assistant who plays a key role in John Connor's life and the future of the resistance. Another T-101 is sent into the present to ensure the protection of John Connor and Katherine Brewster, and to lead them to safety before the coming of judgment day.The story to T3 is very strong, considering the fact that Terminator creator James Cameron is missing this time around. His replacement for this entry is Jonathan Mostow (U-571), who does a superb job in recreating James Cameron's vision of the future and of the machines who rule it. The story does a good job in answering questions such as why judgment day is still going to happen, and the roles that each character plays in the future. The story will make the viewer believe that there was a need to make this sequel, because there was still a story to tell.The actors in this movie stay true to their roles. Arnold is back, and although it's safe to say that this will probably be his last Terminator flick, he does a great job in reprising his role as the protector of John Connor. Edward Furlong, who played John in T2: Judgment Day, is missing this time around, but his replacement Nick Stahl keeps things going as the young man who still questions his role in life. Kristanna Loken is good as the Terminatrix. She brings the attitude and personality that Robert Patrick portrayed in T2. Claire Danes does a good job in her role, seeing that this is her first big role in an action movie.In conclusion, Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is a top-notch action movie that does just about everything right. T3 brings the classic movies together into one unforgettable sequel that will be sure to please fans of the original movies.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

It compels you to pop the original Terminator, or Terminator 2: Judgment Day, into the DVD player/VCR when you come home from the theater, and realize all over again how unbelievably strong the first two films are, especially in comparison to this weak third installment.  Because, other than a noteworthy performance from Arnold Schwarzenegger, some good set design, and a few small touches that recall T1 & T2, the film cannot compensate for poor pacing, lack of a cohesive point-of-view, and a complete turnabout of the fundamental philosophy behind the whole series.  ""The future is not set"" captures the essence of the character's struggle against the machines--the belief that even the least among us could make a difference.

Although there were some novel action scenes, they were nothing really spectacular, and the people scenes lacked interest due to the weak plot. I was struggling to retain interest by the end. Kristanna was miscast for the role of T-X, as her performance was not convincing as a Terminator.

The original films say Skynet killed virtually everyone when they tried to pull the plug when humanity feared Skynet's sentience yet here they supposedly can't since its ""software"" and not ""hardware"". So the memory of the Terminator from T2 was false since that data came from Skynet? Why didn't this Terminator kill humans since he didn't swear to John like T2 and especially since he could only take orders from Claire Danes? What was up with the one liners by Arnold? How was this Terminator's power source different from the two prior movies? In Terminator and T2 you see the main power source is in the abdominal area with a back up. Here he has some stupid slot where he can crack it open and turn it into a mini nuclear bomb. Why did the military have multiple prototypes? Last time I checked a prototype of anything was simply that one piece to be tested and then built in mass if it worked. Why the hell did the place even have a particle accelerator when their work in the lab had nothing to do with atomics?!?!? How did the Terminatrix even pull herself off the magnet when it was never turned off? Why did John continue to hang around the L.A. area if he didn't want to be found? And this is only a few of my problems with the flick. The acting wasn't that good (John is definately not an inspiring leader), the plotting was slow, and they attempted too much humor (the growing breasts was useless and sophmoric). James should have gone with the original T2 ending of John Connor playing in the future with his daughter as Sarah watched talking of how they averted Judgement Day. This trash was far from worthy of the Terminator name and, funniest of all, I saw this movie the day after the premier and the theater was virtually empty. Is that a good sign?",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
1183,Getoutofthewater,You've been terminated,5,3 July 2003,"Though T3 is very competent, it lacks the heart of its 2 predecessors. The film plays like a series of elaborate action scenes (all done very well), with an occasional plot twist thrown in for good measure. Arnold is Arnold, though his quips seemed forced and a bit stale. As for the rest of the cast, they give a workman like effort, yet I felt the film was a bit flat.  I don't necessarily think T3 missed James Cameron, as director Jonathan Mostow has a good eye and films his action sequences with a real amount of flair and some nice bravado.  However, it seemed more of an exercise in excess than actually adding to the terminator franchise. Ultimately the film gives good bang for the buck, but I left feeling cold and uncaring much like the title's namesake.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
1184,rollex321,A let down beyond all beliefs,5,4 July 2003,"I have been a fan of the series my entire life, having seen the first two movies dozens of times (saw the first terminator at the age of 7 initially). After seeing this third installment yesterday, my heart was completely broken.  I didn't think I would take it that seriously, since it is just a movie, but I guess I did.  This is my favorite series after all, and I've been looking forward to the sequel for the last ten years.      What I saw, however, was not a terminator movie, but something else.  With all due respect to Mr. Mostow, it felt as if he had a vendetta to remove every single element that James Cameron had used to make the first two movies what they were, and expect this to be even half a decent sequel.  What was he thinking?  This movie turned into a disaster on a grand scale.  The terminator was completely ruined.  In the first movie, the terminator was portrayed as a cyborg from the future with no sympathy for its victims, and a mission to accomplish.  It was a killing machine, and in my opinion, it looked frightening, and serious.  The second movie I thought did an equally acceptable job at painting this picture.  Both movies had the right music, the right mood, and the suspense required for us to believe that these terminators are not playing around, not to mention the sympathy for the main characters.  They had a very dark touch to them, and seeing the movies as a little kid gave me the creeps.  In this sequel they took that entire aspect, and ripped it out, leaving it as a souless parody.  First off, where did that music go?  That was essential to the movies, but apparently it was decided to be unnecessary this time around.  Second, is this supposed to be the terminator, or a kindergarten cop?  What is the deal with all the poorly written jokes and the ridiculous one liners.  ""Talk to the hand"", ""I'm back"" - give me a break, this is supposed to be the terminator, but they decided to turn it into one long gay joke.  The T-X did not participate nearly enough in the story, and definitely did not display it's full potential. Frankly, I was not impressed.  Instead of an evil terminator, the T-X acted more like that evil alien dressed like a Victoria Secret model from Men in Black 2, although I can't say that I wasn't impressed by the entrance. Bottom line is that the 170 million dollar budget went into some special effects and nothing else.  Here you hardly even get to see the terminators killing their victims, most of it is off screen.  Where is the blood? What's the point of the R rating?  The budget for Terminator 1 was under $7 million, and a lot more was done with that, a LOT more.  Maybe I came in with too high expectations, and the next time I watch the film it won't seem as disappointing.  But  so far all I saw was a Sci-Fi channel original presentation.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

1186,elsilencioesdeoro,Back to back home runs with T2 and T3,10,5 July 2003,"Terminator was a great movie in it's own right. It was an 80s horror film that introduced many of us to Arnold (those of us who hadn't seen Conan). However, Terminator lacked intricacy in it's writing and plot. That problem was quickly resolved in Terminator 2, which showed us that there was so much more to the future, Skynet, and Cyberdyne systems than we thought. Terminator 2 not only brought more story to the table, but more action. It also introduced us to a couple of great actors (Robert Patrick, Edward Furlong). The long anticipated Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines picked up right where T2 left off. Where can you go from T2, some may ask? The story was already brought to a conclusion, right? Wrong. Just when you thought you knew everything, you finally realize that you hardly anything. T3 does exactly what T2 did for Terminator. It takes us even DEEPER into the world of the Terminators and answers a lot of questions that many of us had after T2. The creators of this movie took a series that seemingly had it's strings tied up and created a whole new chapter that is brilliant in it's depth. Not only does T3 bring a great story to the table just as T2 did, but it too brings blockbuster action. After watching T3, it's arguably the best action movie of this summer. Mostow does a great job of filling in for Cameron (we miss you James!). It's truly enjoyable to watch action movies as they used to be made...without much aid of computers. Matrix Reloaded was great...but it relied heavily on computer imagery. Most of T3's action is genuine, jaw dropping stunts. And just as T2 introduced us to new Hollywood faces, so too does T3. Nick Stahl, who plays John Connor, has a great deal of acting talent. He brings his own touch to the character of Connor, now 20 something. We see a whole new side of Connor, very different from the one we saw in T2. In T2, Connor was a rebellious teen who just wanted to have a good time with his friends at the arcade. T3 shows us a worn down, depressed, junkie. Stahl did an excellent job of pulling off the role. He reminded me very much of Tobey Macguire in this movie, perhaps due to his narration and soft-spoken demeanor. We're also introduced to Kristanna Loken, who plays the T-X. It's hard to gauge whether anyone who's recruited to play a terminator truly has any acting talent. The role just doesn't do actors any justice. They must literally constrain their acting talents to the confines of a robot. We obviously know, now, that Schwartzenegger and Patrick were better actors than their terminator roles made them out to be. So too will be the case, I believe, with Loken. Not just anyone can play the role of a terminator. It takes a certain breed and I believe the creators of T3 did a great job of casting. All in all, I give this movie a 9.5, but seeing as that's not a choice, I just rounded up to 10. Bash me if you wish, but I suggest you see the movie. It really is worth the time and money. It delivers in every possible way.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

1189,djsatane2,3rd installement is taking series in right direction but too slow.,10,2 July 2003,"Terminator 3 is really based on scripts that have been flying on net since 1999. Some of the scripts that this movie is mainly based are called T3:Armageddon and its many versions over the years.(Personally the older versions were great) Those scripts call for Arnold Terminator back right before skynet takes over and with Linda and young John he helps them to survive through nuclear holocaust and then fights along Johns side. Now the T3 movie itself is very close to this script. John is saved and Arnold terminator ensures John survives the holocaust but of course his mother is already dead for while. Anyways, the movie itself is on fast pace with battles between T-X and Arnold as John and his future wife(Claire) basically are running away. The action sequences are good. The best part of the movie is when skynet is turned on and together with interacion of the global virus it takes over. Early prototype machines take over in the military building that John gets to trying to prevent judgement day. That's when Arnold gets to fight his precedessors for once and not the advanced TX. Kick ass. However, I wish we would see more of the Skynet taking over. Further the scripts that have been flying on the net explained why Skynet computer system actually turns against humanity. In this movie its not explained, although if you read the scripts you would understand possibly what the virus really was:)(hacker who admires world power and have Hitler for his idol). But, back to the actual movie. It seems that instead of showing us the judgement day and post battle to save humanity Jonathan Mostow decides to widely extend the TX vs T101 battles and finishes the movie on guess what(judgement day) so it's a perfect setup for T4(post nuclear warfare between men and machine). This should and could have been succesfully done in one movie, T3, but at least T3 takes the right direction. I was afraid this movie is gonna bring another ending where they think they prevented judgement day, thank god they didn't.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

This is perhaps one of the most hyped-films of the year (right next to Hulk and Return of the King), and quite a few less-than-promising factors involved (no James Cameron, no Sarah Connor).But let's get to the point:  Was it a great action flick?  Absolutely. Does it make significant headway into the SkyNet storyline?  Definitely?  Did the audience cheer?  Oh yes.Nit-picky details aside, this movie continued to build, build, build (in a wonderful array of action sequences than truly put you in the seat of danger, and in developing the new characters).  It climaxes with the inevitable activation of SkyNet, and leaves you wanting more in the end.Great movie.

Well they pulled it off.  While its not as good as T2, T3 is certainly an action packed film from the start, and I thought it was awesome.  It moves along at a much faster pace than the previous two films, therefore it lags behind the others in plot and story, however its right up there with them in adreniline pumping action and that occasional humor. However, the timline explained in this film is even more messed up than the timeline in T2 believe it or not.  Am I the only person who has ever noticed that in T2 when the T1000 looks up John in the police database it specifically says he is 10?

1193,PaperCutz,No sense of pacing,1,5 July 2003,"Terminator 3 was average at best. This film had no sense of pacing in my opinion and spent no time at all letting us get to know the characters. Cameron's absence was very obvious. Instead of taking time to build up to each climax terminator 3 just threw it all at us in the beginning and then went down hill from there, throwing chase seen after chase seen and battle after battle until the very predictable ending. The TX that was supposed to be all powerful got her ass kicked all the time and didn't fare half as well as the T-1000 did in T2. I felt like i had hardly seen Arnold in the movie and they spent practically no time on the TX at all other than a few stupid scenes where she said ""hey..i like ur bike"" and ""hey i like ur car"". At the end of terminator 2 i felt like i knew the all the character better, terminators and all. This movie didn't allow us to get to know anyone and i felt like the director didn't really care about that aspect of movie making. This movie is a disgrace to the terminator series and has ruined the greatness the series had. If i had never seen the other terminator movies i may have given this movie a 6, but since i have and i love the other two this movie gets a big 4 and a warning to all who love the terminator series and have yet to see this movie.Only watch this movie if u don't care about the other movies or ur really into special effects and explosions and you just want a action movie where no brain activity is required.

1195,Algrewehou,Definitely the Best Terminator Movie of them All,10,3 March 2004,"I saw the entire trilogy back to back to back. This one was definitely the best. In the first, the music was like something out of a video game and it was more of a ridiculous love story than a science fiction action film. The second film was a little better than the first because it focused more on the time travel aspects and the war in the future. I liked the fact that John Connor was a bit of a motorcycle punk. That's the kind of guy I'd elect to be a military leader, but I didn't like the idea that Sarah Connors was in the insane asylum. In ""Rise of the Machines"", however, it made a terrific link to the war in the future. The terminator (Model # T-X), who was both more powerful and hotter than the other two, had multiple targets and most of them were killed. Therefore, its mission was mostly a success. The only down side to this movie is that the creators brought back THE Terminator, Arnold Scharzenegger. I don't think that Arnold really should be in any more of the Terminatory movies. Finally, after watching this movie, I felt that it could be a good ending, but it could also be added on to. For example, the fourth terminator movie, if there ever will be one, could deal with John not having all the generals he would have had for the war and how humankind can overcome its follies with machines.I give this movie a 10 out of 10. For Terminator fans and general Sci-Fi fans, i would highly recommend this movie. Unfortunately, I wouldn't recommend it to little kids, tho.

It had action scenes and what not but no real base line to it story wise. You already know what Terminator is about but there could have been more added to the story line, they explain things well so it wasn't very hard to catch on at all, but it seems like there is something missing not enough effort on this one. The end just leaves you wanting more but not on a good basis. You can obviously tell there will be a forth movie I just hope it will be better than this one hopefully a little more complex not just cheesy wannabe catch phrases and a pair of sun glasses.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

They had me cringing, noticably (putting my hands over my head in disgrace), not to mention Arnie comming out of the stipping club with his ""new shades"" (youve been warned) it pained me to see what this film was doing to the other 2Obviously some people will be total suckers for it and think it's funny, but at the end of the day they have turned it into a cheesy kids version of T2, its disgusting. Right lets get this straight, T1, and T2 were serious films, thats what made them so great, T1 was a daaark film, its a masterpiece, T2 was just as good but managed to do it being a blockbuster aswell (and was also dark and serious), T3 aboloshes all of this with appaling acting, lame story, terrible one liners trying to be deliberatly funny, since when were they meant to be deliberatly funny??? Is Arnie trying to win the audience over? ""Please like me again, pretty please"" Argh its painfullAnd since when was Arnie worth $30 million for this? That has to be the easiest money in history, he did hardly anything in here to desrve it, it wasnt even acting he just muttered some lines in a terminator voice,
Also, I did give a monkeys about Arnie and John Conner in T2, but why didnt I give a damn about em in this film? Bad acting, bad script? i dunnoIt certainly lacked a biiiiig something, James Cameron, thats whatOn the plus side, there was some good action, if thats what u want, but all in all I was very dissapointed, and I will laugh at people who say they like this cos they obviously dont know what a good film is, they obviously wont know what good acting is, or a good script,I am now mentally scarred.5/10",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

The comedy was funny, but very out of place for this kind of movie. And Arnold didn't have many lines besides his catch phrases.

This was an all around fun movie, with as much destruction and stoic one liners as can be crammed into a two hour movie. Whoever missed James Cameron in this film was also to busy reminiscing to perceive how good this movie really is.Granted, T-X was no-where near as sinister as the T-1000, but you were kept wondering up until the last 5 minutes of the movie how they were going to get rid of her. Now, the ending is exactly what I would hope for. A complete twist, slightly predictable, but exactly as I would like it to be. I will say no more for those who haven't seen it yet.

Nick Stahl does a great job of taking Edward Furlong's place as John Conner, putting lots of emotion and grit into the part. Claire Danes does a magnificent job as Kate Brewster, also adding some raw emotion to her part. At age 56 Arnold looks as tough as ever as the Terminator proofing age is nothing but a number.

Nick Stahl, while a talented actor, was just not cut out for this role.  Also, there was way too much product placement.  The magic of the first two is gone forever.  The Terminator series has turned into predictable Hollywood crap.  While I wasn't crazy about the softening up and kid-friendliness of Arnold in T2, the intensity and energy of that film was undeniable and kept you at the edge of your seat.  This element was absent in T3.  Stahl and Clair Danes just didn't contribute enough of an emotional element to carry the story. T1 was a landmark in action/sci fi films.  T3 is just typical Hollywood. I have to hand it to James Cameron.  He jumped off this sinking ship just in time.

Strong performances from Claire Danes and Nick Stahl helped humanize the over-the-top scenario. The only problem with the series' development is that the cyborgs keep becoming more omnipotent so that it strains credulity that they couldn't easily destroy a couple of mere out-of-shape mortals who can do little more than run or drive away. Still great stunt work, especially in the first part of the film. In fact, the first half uses up most of the adrenaline of the movie, which deflates the climax a bit.

Arnold looked great.but the plot was average and somehow just wasn't as intelligent as T2.  i know I'm not supposed to expect intelligence from an action flick, but i did.  The acting was wooden and characters were one sided.  I had trouble understanding everyone's motivation.  (except for the terminator himself who by definition is one sided, wooden, and motivated).  There were also some unexplained idiosyncracies that seemed like the director was going to do something more but then changed his mind.  but then at the other extreme, there were some things that were very obvious, but yet were still drilled into us again and again.overall, a good action flick.  but I was expecting more.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

But anyone looking for a quality action movie will not.  That's basically what this movie is: a quality movie that doesn't let it's viewers down.  We all know that T2 is one of the best action movies of all time and that pedigree makes this movie tough to live up to expectations.  But T3 comes through in some ways and doesn't in others.  The action is first rate ( I liked the fact there is very little cgi and a lot more real things being blown up), the actors turn in good performances (Arnold pretty much looks as he did in T2), and it makes you want to see T4 (if they make it).  The only problems i have with the film are very nitpicky.  There is somewhat of a lack of cinematography (it made me miss James Cameron's blue tinted T2), and the Terminatrix is so unbelievably beautiful that it was tough for me to be scared of her.

When I saw a couple of the trailers for the film, I thought it was going to be a joke.  C'mon Arnold playing a ""Terminator"" at 55 and coming a from heart surgery a few years ago?  I mean Arnold is still in great shape but he couldn't possibly pull it off, right?  Wrong!  Physically, Arnold showed that he could still pull off the action genre.  The only area where he looked aged was in his face (slightly receding hairline and receding eyebrows, along with a few wrinkles.)  For a 55 year old man, I would pray to look like him.As for the movie, I truly believe it was the second best film in the trilogy.  Let's be real, T2 was probably the greatest action film of all time.  T3 came very close to surpassing the previous movie.  Along with a solid story, great stunts and special effects, I felt that the movie was money well spent!

I guess they didn't wanna make it 2 serious because it would be dissapointing to people since nothing can be as good as T2 hahaha but yea... it sets up for what's to come later... nothing else will be said =) go watch the movie and read this and then you will get what I mean. Hope I didn't say 2 much : THIS IS A SPOILER DO NOT READ PAST THIS!!
 Why does the terminator (arnold) kill John? I didn't get the reason.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
1211,DarkKnight114,"Great Movie, Worthy Sequel.",10,1 July 2003,"The first Terminator was great, the second was even better, and of course, twelve years later, I had my reservations about this installment of the series. My reservations are now laid to rest.Terminator is an amazing movie from start to finish, blending seamlessly traditional action, stunts, and fine elements of CGI which many times, you don't even notice is there. It successfully advances the plot to new areas, and raises interesting questions, while holding true to the many one liners the series is known for. Add to this a hot new terminator who can make her chest grow at will and get it on with the old T-800 in a bathroom, and you've got a good time on your hands.Terminator 3 gets better as it progresses until it ends with a climactic ending which is both incredible, and shocking. The series can only get better from here, and I have no doubt that the next installment will bring a whole new light to where it's going from here. If I have only one question to raise about this movie, it's where the 175 million dollars went... besides Arnold's pocket that is.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
1212,rosebugie,"All in all, nicely done",8,3 July 2003,"All in all, I liked this follow-up to the other two Terminator films. I do admit that I would have liked to see the original John and the a return of Sarah Connor, but I have to say that this new cast has got something new and fresh to add to the series. I don't understand this mess about not understanding the plot or the plot  does not have the Jim Cameron surprise flare to it. What?!? How can people say this was not surprising?!? Obviously some of the negative critics were not big fans of the other two movies. The plot was just continuing the story with a nice little twist at the end ( I smell a T-4....hmmm...) When leaving the theater,I wasn't sure I liked it much but now, after thinking about all of the different elements brought to the film, I see that T-3 was quite good (It will never be as large as the other two but very very very close in my mind...). I would give it an 8 out of 10. It was exciting, intense, non-stop action. The dialogue gets a little confusing and Ah-nold still doesn't ennunciate his words but I thought the story was really great. Any fan of The Terminator films will like this one. I do recommend it but MAKE SURE YOU SEE THE OTHERS BEFORE YOU SEE THIS ONE! Oh yeah, for those that do not like all the action packed things, there is a lot of classic humor and a small love story that play into the film. The ending is also sad and tear jerking....umm...yeah :-/ ....go and enjoy the film!",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
1213,jcnhwildcat,Acceptable...,6,1 July 2003,"but leaves too many plot holes unfilled.  No shortage of action or Arnold one-liners.  The story is plausible, and is an interesting twist (especially the end) to the saga.  But what the film basically accomplishes is to set the stage and pave the way for T4, the post-apocalyptic story most fans probably want to see, and perhaps wanted to see in T3.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
1214,thatgentleman,"THE ABSOLUTE BEST FILM OF 2003! IT'S GOT EVERYTHING, YOU'LL LOVE IT!",10,2 July 2003,"THE MOVIE OF THE YEAR HAS ARRIVED!  This was an absolute excellent movie and perfect new addition for the Terminator series.  The style and editing is kept in line with the previous' films design yet is expanded upon through action that is not-stop and unlike anything you've ever seen.  Besides that, THE SCRIPT IS BRILLANT.  It clears up ALL the plot holes you may have been wondering about from previous films such as ""How the heck can a whiny civilian kid end up being the future leader of the human military resistance?"" and ""Does a 'terminator' being sent back to the past change the future timeline everytime one is sent back?"".  The new characters perfectly fit the series and add incredible character development and archs to their personality.  T3 is an absolutely vital addition to the series and features SOME OF THE BEST ACTION SEQUENCES EVER CAPTURED ON FILM.  It also has a major emotional pull and some great dramatic scenes as characters live, die, and go through major changes before your eyes.  The acting is top-notch. Expect Loken and Stahl to become major stars after this one.  There are many twists and turns along the way too - THIS IS JUST ONE ROLLERCOASTER RIDE THAT NEVER LETS UP!  GO SEE IT AS MANY TIMES AS YOU CAN - YOU'LL LOVE IT!",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
1215,zepoopy,Awesome,8,1 July 2003,"Absolutely awesome. Arnold was such a bad ass.  Non-stop destruction and likewise, entertainment.  The story too was better than I expected it to be. They really did a lot to enhance the previous stories, instead of regurgitating stuff we were already aware of.  Overall it made it feel like a entirely new story instead of just a sequel.I can only hope that there will be a fourth.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
1216,terrystec,Completely satisfied,10,2 July 2003,"As a big fan of the first two films, I was prepared to be disappointed. But T3 delivered everything you want a movie (or at least this movie) to do. Excellent story, characters, action, effects... it was all there and all good. You will holler at the screen. Go see this movie and enjoy it.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
1217,matatiouz,It's Not Arnolds fault,1,2 July 2003,"Spoiler Terminator 3 is horrible.  The dialogue is awful.  The acting lacks motivation.  There are too many catch lines.  In the beginning, the visual metaphor with the deer and the motorcycle insulted my intelligence.  And of course Arnold's exploding chest battery, established in the beginning, is going to kill ""Terminatrix"" in the end. It's all Hollywood, and nothing else.  Its not Arnold's FAULT; just Jonathan Mostow's.  The directing leaves everything to be desired.   And can you believe it, the movie ends when the machines BEGIN their ""rise.""  Why? Cause their going to make terminator 4.  The marketing ploy is sadly obvious.  If there is a bronze lining, it would be 1 of the action scenes; mediocre.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
1218,spectrum21,Arnold is finally back.,9,2 July 2003,"Arnold defintely returns, not only to the Terminator series, but to good action movies, from a slump of a few years. When I first saw the trailers for this movie I thought it looked like it was going to bomb, and be terrible, especially without Cameron directing it, and Hamilton not returning as Sarah Connor.  Then I started hearing good things about it closer to its release, so decided to go see it on it's premiere night. I was amazed, Mostow had pulled it off, a very excellent Terminator movie the lived up to its name.  It didn't have as much as a ""dark"" feel to it as much as the first two, but it did have everything else.  The action, the explosions, and Arnie.  A couple of scenes did feel like they were remakes from T2, but other than that it was pretty original. The hand-to-hand fighting scenes between the good and bad terminators were off the hook. It was also nice to see some of the machines from the ""future wars"" to appear in modern day.  Some of them didn't look too different from some of the spy planes that the US military are using today, which was kind of creepy. The ending was defintely the icing on the cake, throwing me for a loop, I never expected it to end the way it did.  This movie is better than Matrix Reloaded, and quite possibly the best summer action movie of 2003.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
1219,f1tech,"Finally, for the Terminator series fan...",10,2 July 2003,"I applaud the creators for taking the time to making sure a sequel is true to its predecessors.  Although the plot is amazingly similar to the previous two Terminator films, it introduces enough new storyline content to make it interesting, and also leave you hungry for whatever may come next.The action scenes were definitely in-line with what you would expect from a $170 million dollar budget, and the character development was right-on.Having waited all this time for the next installment of the Terminator series, I found the movie was a must see, and I was not disappointed.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
1220,seabert02,Best sequel I've seen in a while,10,2 July 2003,"Even if T3 seems to be just a modified remake of T2, that alone should make it worth watching. As a sequel, T3 will undoubtedly be attacked as not breaking any new ground like T1 (in a thematic way) or T2 (pioneering computer imaging), and for dragging out a franchise and career of an actor that some say should have long been put to rest. As a great fan of the other two Terminator movies, however, I have no problem with a 3rd installment that hasn't changed much. It still has thrilling action that even blows away summer block-buster rivals Hulk and Matrix Reloaded, and sustains the excitement through its open-ended conclusion. The dialogue, chock full of one-liners resembling classic Ah-nold flicks like Commando and Total Recall, is a bit corny in spots, but is generally enjoyable. Interestingly, this sequel returns to the gloom and doom theme choice of T1, and not the playful ""boy and his robot"" type of lightness of T2. All in all, this has been the best action movie and best sequel I have seen in a long, long time.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
1221,TinyVoices,"So, so, so terrible. It boggles my mind.",1,2 July 2003,"$170 million is just enough to get Arnold Schwarzenegger and some pretty impressive special effects. It's too bad that only left them with a $5 dollar budget for getting a screenplay together. Terminator was excellent. Terminator II might have been even better, but they were great because the story was interesting and the characters were worth watching. I watched the entire movie saying to myself, ""alright...it can't get any worse."" But it did...it most certainly did. Sorry to write a bad review.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
1222,AutoPilot,James Cameron: where art thou? The spirit you gave T1 & 2 has been Terminated!,4,2 July 2003,"Plot Details: This opinion reveals minor details about the movie's plot. T-3 doesn't have the feeling, spirit or intensity of T-1 or T-2. I say this with a heavy heart. T-1 & 2 are among my favorite movies of all time. Arnie is the perfect Terminator, and I love many of his movies. This is the first time I've seen Nick Stahl, Kristanna Loken, or Claire Danes, and they all did a great job. But the magic of the previous films was not there. The movie seemed like it was made by following the script and storyboards like a studio musician playing the notes from his sheet. Done correctly, but certainly not a Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, Jim Morrison... and others like them who gave performances that explode with intense passion. John Conner (Nick Stahl) He's burned out, on the run, doesn't have a plan or any direction, and a total wimp. Not even his Terminator obeys him. T-X (Kristanna Loken) She's the new Terminator, and like her predecessor, the T-1000 played by Robert Patrick in T-2, she can change her appearance (but confusingly has the hard steel skeleton of the earlier model T-800, that Arnold plays) So sometimes she's liquid steel, and sometimes not, since she can change from female to male. Her face is beautiful and exotic, and she can look very cold, confident, and robotic; but not wicked evil and totally dedicated like Patrick's Terminator of T-2. Kate Brewster (Claire Danes) Nice close-ups, a beautiful face and good acting, she played her part well. Still, there was simply not the intensity of purpose that Linda Hamilton brought to the previous films. T-800 (Arnold) Erroneously calling himself a T-101, Arnie, is back! Arnie, of course is `The Terminator,' so it's hard to screw-up that role. But he can only do what the script allows. He plays his part, delivers his one-liners, but is a different Terminator than he played earlier. Same model, but as we all know, the second Terminator played by Arnold, was terminated. So there is no `feeling' between him and John Conner, or Kate Brewester like there was in the earlier films between John and his mother Sara Conner. In fact it seems Arnold doesn't care about them at all. Music Score: What score? Although Terminator has one of the finest theme and soundtrack music in the history of modern movies, they simply didn't use it. It's like a Star Wars movie without the classic theme song. A major mistake.Tension, mood, drama, feeling, intensity, story, plot. ooops, completely forgot about all of that. Just cram in as much action and destruction as a movie can hold within one hour and 45 minutes. Special Effects: At least most of them were real (I hope) as opposed to computer generated. I'm talking about the `Vehicle' chase scenes. In this episode, female Terminator TX remotely controls un-manned police and fire engines, while simultaneously and physically driving a large crane on wheels, laying massive destruction in her path. Many cars and telephone poles lost their lives in this chase scene. While very destructive, it just didn't compare to previous Terminator chase scenes, especially the one in the concrete storm ditch of T-2. Surprisingly, special effects were minimal and not very impressive. The steel Terminator endoskeleton was the same as the original, so nothing new there and personally, I thought the flying robots looked very amateur and out-dated. The screening I attended was the first public showing in one of Los Angeles', newest and largest theatres. It was of course filled, but the audience reaction was very subdued. A few chuckled at some of the one-liners and one couldn't help but laugh at Arnie's first pair of sunglasses. Another laugh came when the Female Terminator TX saw a billboard with a Buxom model with the words: What is Sexy?' and decided to redirect some of her liquid steel to her chest area and - Viola! Instant breast enlargement! The interesting thing is the very favorable and quite audible reaction was by the females in the audience as they squealed with joy and envy at such power. In conclusion, I think the movie suffered without the direction of James Cameron. The plot was filled with holes the size of large nuclear craters. The movie was dependant on fast action to carry it, but other than the chase scene near the beginning, it just didn't. The ending was very weak, but its intent was quite obvious - it was a lead-in to Terminator 4. As Arnold likes to say: ""I'll be back!"" The Bottom Line:   Disappointment. Even still, I recommend seeing it because the series, like Star Wars, is a legend. It would leave a void otherwise, and it's necessary to understand future Terminator movies.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
1223,danlan,"Great Fx, but is that enough?",3,2 July 2003,"This did not live up to my expectations for the Terminator series.Yes, there are REAL fx, and the crane scene is fantastic.  It's tough to beat the cgi of the matrix, but reality is a lot scarier than a stop action fight scene on a semi.And yes, the terminatrix is amazing.  Great acting and cgi, but the T-1000 in T2 just seemed to be a lot scarier.  She held her own, and tried to play the T-1000 style, but... Is it even possible to destroy her?The lines in T1 and T2 did seem like they were 'right on', but like the other reviews have said, T3 just seemed a little off here and there.  And just 'appearing' in a top secret base with weapons loaded is a BIG stretch. Did they cut a scene or two to get it under two hours??I could watch T1 and T2 a few times, but I was disappointed with T3.All your base are belong to us.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
1224,Ite,The T800 is back,8,2 July 2003,"It was great seeing the T800 back and his relationship with John Connor. ""Hasta La Vista, remember? No that was a different model."" I also liked the cameo from the doctor from the first 2 films. I like this movie for the nostalgia. I went into the theater not knowing what to expect, so i was pleasantly suprised. The new TX is hot and plays a good villian. This is a different film than the first 2 but remember that the first 2 films were also different from each other. I can't compare it to the first 2 because i was a kid when i saw them. I actually saw T2 at the theater when it first came out. Theres no way to compare the feeling i had when i saw that to this, it was a different feel. Without giving anything away i really liked the ending.t3 - 8/10",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

Long life to ""The rise of machines""!!!",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
1227,theFresnel,Rise of the dollar,6,2 July 2003,"When compared to the first and second Terminator movies, T3 is probably average at best.The special effects were top notch but the movie seemed forced. Whereas the first and second at times grew deep and philosophical (or as much as this storyline would allow), T3 had none of that. It was just action scenes mixed in with ho-hum dialogue to explain what was about to happen next.Terminator 2 technically was a sequel, but it didn't *feel* like a sequel. T2 could have stood on its own.Terminator 3, on the other hand, pretty much assumes that the viewer is familiar with the storyline. Old characters (just one really) are shamelessly plugged in for quick appearances that didn't further the storyline one bit. New characters have been added and their histories faked to appear as if they've always been a part of the Terminator world. The movie watched as if it was the last season of some long running television series overdue for retirement.On the plus side, T3 has some strengths. As mentioned earlier, the special effects were excellent. Also, the writers gave the Terminator some hilarious moments.This is a short movie and the action moves briskly. Watch it if you're a fan of the series or if you're into awesome action scenes, but don't expect it to be very deep. 6 out of 10.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

I won't give away anything, but even the most hardcore Terminator fan will be proud to see the end result! And if you haven't seen the first two, you probably will after watching this one...You simply HAVE to see this movie, and you cannot wait until you can find it at blockbuster!",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

It is not as good as T2, however it will still be one of the biggest movies of the summer. Arnold paid $1.4 mil. for one of the scenes that was to be cut due to budget. The movie was full of action from the start, however the ending was disapointing. John Conner is not as strong a character as he was in T2.

I couldn't possibly imagine how they could explain there way out of how the last one ended. All of SkyNet had been destroyed with the last terminator, so in my mind there was no need for another movie. But I went anyway; I couldn't pass up on the chance that it would be worth seeing. And I was NOT disappointed at all; this movie was one of my top ten movie experiences. The movie had incredible special effects, as you would expect, without being over the top to the point of disbelief. The action was non-stop, realistic, and supported the movie. There were no useless action scenes, just to have action. The acting wasn't as bad as I thought it would be, in fact I thought it was well acted. Being an action movie there wasn't a lot of dialog but when there was the actors sold their parts very well. Overall, I would say this is a great flic, worth the price of admission, and something that I will see again in the theater. I highly recommend it. 9\10",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

T3 isnt as good as T2 (T2 revolutionize action films along with the first matrix) but is better than the first. Great use of CG, i didnt even relieze it was fake.

1233,ticktanium,Like watching an expensive B Movie.,3,3 July 2003,Spoiler info and personal thoughts in here.I set my expectations on low just expecting to see more of a continuation of T2.  This way I wouldn't be disappointed.  That was way too high to set the bar.  As much as I love Arnold they couldn't have watched this and thought it was good.Remote controlling cars from the early part of the movie was an indication of how bad things were going to get.  WHY?  Totally un-necessary and downright dumb.Too Many Jokes.  He's not human and didn't need so many 80's style one-liners.  It was almost like watching the Brady Bunch Movies where they just mock the whole Brady Bunch theme.Why wasn't she more upset about losing her fiancé?  She got over it awfully quick.There was no need for a romance between the characters.The truck magically bounces over the girl to hit the terminatrix perfectly. Rewrite that scene.  It was painfully dumb.Better acting on the general's part and some military resistance would have helped.  Where were the military personnel?Why when the police were shooting them in the Hearse did they never hit a window where conners was hiding?  Why couldn't he have killed the swat members?  He's the Terminator with Barney programming?The Terminator fights my re-programming scene?  Ouch.  Very Lame.More of the Takeover of the machines in the base would have been better. That was your real chance to capitalize on the movie and you have 2 lame fight scenes and its over.  And how did conner and the girl get in there so easily?  What's with the lame missile through the window with the lamest missile explosion ever?  Might as well have been a bottle rocket.The real question is where did they spend the so-called 180 million?When did Conner become such a wuss.I get the feeling this movie was just thrown together and never thought out at all.  It's cheesy and dumb.  Could have been very good with about a dozen or two changes but just never delivers.  Recall the movie now before the weekend and fix it before its reputation is ruined.,Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
1234,slecraft,"Possibly the best of the series, definitely the best movie of summer 2003.",10,3 July 2003,"I was very impressed with T3.  It is definitely better than T2, and quite possibly even better than the original Terminator.  Of the many movies I've seen this summer, this was by far the best: it is the most well written, has the best action, and even contends for the best humor.  I haven't been this engaged and drawn into a movie since ""Fellowship of the Ring"" came out a year and a half ago.  The characters are very well written and acted, and the plot remained true to the first two movies.  In fact, I think that the series as a whole makes more sense now that T3 has been added to it.  I would recommend this movie to anyone who is comfortable with the R rating.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
1235,chainsaw884,Up there with Hot Shots and Robin Hood men in tights,3,3 July 2003,"Not really sure the direction the director was heading with the the third installment of the terminator series but definately not anywhere I would have liked it to gone.  It was almost as if Mostow took everything from the previous terminators and made them into a joke in this one.  Yes we all know that the terminator has to find clothes somewhere but the director has to make a joke out of it.  The terminator is a machine.  He would not know whether sunglasses were considered socially feminine.  I dont understand. I sat there and laughed the entire time I was watching the movie.  I wasn't laughing with the director but at just how horrible it was.  The jokes were funny in that way that you laugh because they are incredibly stupid.  Its almost as if it should have been a pg-13 kids movie aside from the swearing and blood.  I am a pretty big fan of the Terminator series, especially the first one, and was very dissapointed.  The first terminator had a very dark, intense style which was lost a little with the second one but still executed.  Everything that was good about the other ones was gone.  The acting was horrible, the plot was simple, and the tone was childish.  The movie is wraught with cheesey one liners and taglines and seemed unable to get passed that.  I feel sorry for James Cameron.  He must be crying right now.  The change is comparable to that Batman series.  Batman and Batman returns were good and then it all just went hollywood corporate.  The thing that suprised me the most was coming online and seeing that it was almost hard to find a bad review.  I guess that what I thought was cool about the first two was not what all the terminator nerds thought was cool. Its worse than what happened to the star wars series.  They thought the jokes were funny and all the talked about were the action sequences.  The first one had very little big budget action but it made up for it in story-line and suspense.  Try watching the first and third movies back to back and you can truly see how stupid the series has gotten.  Oh well, there were a few redeeming scenes that I can hopefully convince myself was worth the 8 bucks. The movie was a big cheesey joke. Don't see this movie unless your a big dork.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

Ah-nold is still doing his thing in a major way. Here's hoping that the storywriters keep the twists and surprising with the indomitable Terminator. Kristanna Loken is a knockout.

The T-X makes a great villain and good enough to surpass the T-1000 in the second movie. She (loosely here) kills her victims almost as ruthlessly as the T-1000.The story is the most important part of this film and any plot holes that I had were patched up upon second viewing of this movie.

I figured that it has been over 10 yeaers since T2 and I didn't think that the franchise would be able to support a third movie.  I was WRONG. The movie expands on the history of the series and manages to answer that question of ""if we destroyed SkyNet, how is there a third movie?"" quite well. Arnold does another excellent job of portraying the stony and unemotional T-800, and Kristanna Loken does an amazing job as the new Evil Treminatrix.  Of course the fact that she is a beautiful blonds in a sexy outfit does not hurt the movie either. All in all, this is the first good movie of 2003.  I went in expecting a good action movie with maybe a little depth too it and T:3 delivered in Spades.  The movies starts Fast and never lets you get back into your seat while manageing not to skip the angst of knowing what the future is going to bring and the fear of having to live up to expectations.I give this movie a solid 9.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
1239,emory7,It's Good To Be Back,10,30 July 2003,"Mostow has injected a lot of the same spirit from previous Terminator films into Terminator 3, cleverly causing you to undergo a bit of what weightlifters call `muscle memory.' Although wildly entertaining and pleasantly reminiscent of past films, Terminator 3 as a whole did not resonate like the first two films. That's not to say it didn't achieve greatness, just not the type of greatness Cameron achieved in the good old days. The key change from Cameron to Mostow proved too dissonant for some fans. Cameronistas resent Mostow's style as action over substance. Reading their remarks on the movie forums would have one believe the film represents more of a lowering of humans than rising of machines. T3 is not T2. Mostow is not Cameron. Let James Cameron be James Cameron, or at least Jim Cameron, and let everyone else be themselves.Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines had to hold its ground and simply not be bad. It held. It did more than that. It succeeded. Humor, action, and preservation of the Terminator motifs gave the film life. The word `terminated' will continue to live as a great movie euphemism. Whether or not the Terminator series will rise again, only time will tell.

It was almost better than T1 and T2....Geez!I was sincerely impressed with the acting, casting, effects, story, music etc...Just loved it...Cant wait to get it on DVD.Ill be waiting for T4 with passion!GG Jonathan Mostow!",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
1241,somegodforsakenID,"AWESOME EFFECTS, BUT SLIGHTLY DISAPPOINTING STORY",9,7 July 2003,"I had enormous expectations from this movie, and from all the stars, but in the end, I was a bit disappointed. My first thoughts were, ""I think this movie misses James Cameron"". But, we have to be fair to Mostow. Who can stand up to a challenge as great as this - continuing the Terminator series, especially when T2 was such a big hit.As expected, the special effects were unbelievable !! It's amazing what you can make pple think they're watching, these days. But I felt that the movie didn't have any direction. The chases just kept going on and on, and I didn't quite understand what was happening.All the actors did pretty well. Arnold was excellent as usual, Claire Danes was made for that Kate Brewster role, and Stahl was not bad. Although it was a little strange to see a female Terminator (I'm not trying to be sexist) as strong as the T-X, Loken did well.The movie was definitely very entertaining. The action was very good, special effects amazing, with some good laughs. It didn't give you a chance to get up and take a leak (there was no intermission !). I would definitely recommend it to any action/sci-fi movie or Arnold fan.Overall, I think this movie deserves a 9 out of 10.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
1242,cainam,Excellent! Best movie of 2003,10,5 July 2003,"Out of all the big movies released (X2, Matrix 2, Hulk, etc) this one is the best!  Non-stop action, a solid cast with top-notch acting, and a very good ending.  I didn't actually expect much since Cameron wasn't directing T3 but it turned out to be a pleasant surprise!  See this in the theatre while you can!",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
1243,magiclady1,As good as the orignial...Loved it,9,5 July 2003,"Done so well, the action and the story line moved right along.  I was caught up in the story within minutes of the movie starting.  Just tell me how Arnold S. stays so young looking.  He hasn't changed at all from the original movie.  All the actors were good.  Would see again and for me thats saying a lot.  Recommeded to all my friends.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
1244,Nuuu,To think: I'm criticizing Arnold for showing TOO MUCH emotion,1,6 July 2003,"Poor writing and poor directing plagued this film.  The characters simply weren't who they were supposed to be.John Connor (Nick Stahl) who was trained in weapons and warfare from childhood by his mother dealt unflinchingly with the threat of the T-1000 as a 13 year old boy now appears to be a scared and confused drifter who freezes under pressure and exudes none of the confidence or ingenuity he did a decade ago.The T-X (Kristanna Loken) is cartoony.  In place of ruthless efficiency for which the terminators are known she kills sadistically.  Rather then relentlessly pursuing her enemy she seems to saunter and pose in what I can only assume is an attempt to build suspense.   And in the end, she simply isn't that frightening of a villain.Arnold was the biggest disappointment if only because he played the role with far too much of a human feel.  He has emotional conversations with John Connor, appears angry and surprised at times, and has a number of one-liners during action sequences that require far more wit than a machine with no emotion should be capable of.The sound was absurd.  When the terminator or the T-X was hit with something heavy we were greeted by a cartoony ""boink"" rather than something realistic. The soundtrack also lacked all of the attitude and intensity that truly set the atmosphere for the first two movies.*spoilers*And the continuity errors and unanswered questions ruined any hope of a story the movie may have hadTerminator 2 tells us that terminators (at least stock terminators) can't learn.  Arnie clearly does, after learning and reciting the ""talk to the hand"" phrase.Terminator 1 tells us that The Terminators were only sent back to kill John as a last ditch effort once the resistance had destroyed the skynet core. Now, Skynet doesn't have a core at all.Why would the US government leave a secret, high grade fallout shelter COMPLETELY unguarded?How did John, Kate, and a 6 foot tall terminator in black leather make it to the command center of a busy high tech military research facility without authorization and while carrying loaded weapons?  And why isn't anyone surprised to see them there until shooting starts?While the T-X can control machines, how can she remotely move the gear shift of a car from park to drive, an action that requires physical interaction?If, as T2 suggests, the concept of skynet was only made possible by the discovery of the pieces of the destroyed terminator from T1, how was it possible in T3 after John Connor destroyed all remnants of the terminators sent back through time?Unfortunately I could go on and on from here.  From the final product it appears as though the writers spent less time on the script for this movie than I did on this review",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
1245,hyttfors,"If you are a fan, you will be disappointed! Want a parody of the previous two movies, you will love it!",1,6 July 2003,"I just want to warn people for this movie. If you are a big fan of the previous Terminator movies, I'm sorry but you will get disappointed. This is a bad movie! This is not a third Terminator movie with all the thrills, action and story telling that the last two movies offered. It is an action comedy with the typical Hollywood explosions and a bombard of bad jokes that totally ""terminate"" the seriousness of the movie. it's very easy to get Star Wars 1 flashbacks. with other words it's not worth the money!!",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
1246,killeragy,Think about it,9,3 August 2003,"Well, so far I haven't read too many compliments about this film. (I did like it, that's for sure). All of you people have to realize that T2 was 12 years ago - the effects were new, and we hadn't seen this many sci-fi-action movies back then. You have to keep this in mind when you watch this film. Nowadays we're kind of overwhelmed by computer-generated effects, blood, sex, car chases, etc. This can be the reason why we haven't experienced the same ""breakthrough-feeling"" after watching T3. Think about it.Note: we were also twelve years younger then (compare Star Wars episodes in this context).Great movie, Schwarzenegger is simply the best. Rate: 9/10",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
1247,jsrfun,What a waste,3,6 July 2003,"I honestly am shocked at how bad this movie was.  The acting was laughable: at times you could almost see ""John Conner"" looking for a cue.  If this comes anywhere close to making a dime I will be surprised.  The action sequences were silly, the dialogue was CHEESY, and the story almost seemed like a farse.  I almost hope for a sequel just so the story can be salvaged, but don't hold out hope for an improvement without a James Cameron.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
1248,bridgmanr,Truly awful formulaic remake,3,7 July 2003,"I suppose there's probably only so much you can do with this plot the 3rd time around, but then again I didn't expect much in the way of a story line. However even the action was lame and tired. No suspense, no tension, a few fancy digital effects, the obligatory pithy one-liners. A big disappointment.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
1249,jaynslntbob2001,Cameron less? It still can work.,8,8 July 2003,"When I went to go watch Terminator 3, I didn't know what to expect. Is this some sort of money making scheme from Arnold since his last few movies where busts?, or was this film really going to be a great addition to the Terminator saga. The answer was both. Since most of the original forefathers weren't involved with the picture, the new fresh voices added a wonderful new adventure pack addition to the story. I understand you can't always get the same actors involved, and I'm glad that they added new characters to take their place. Keeping Linda and Eddie in the film would have felt like a T2 remake instead of a sequel.I truly enjoyed this movie, and I hope that they decide to continue with the saga, hopefully we don't have to wait another twelve years to see it though.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
1250,NorcoKris,It was FANTASTIC and held true to the originals!,10,7 July 2003,"I loved it!  I have seen T3 twice already and it hasn't even been out a week.  I thought it held true to the original movies and lacked nothing despite the change in makers.  The second time I saw it, I took my nine year old nephew.  He also loved it!It has plenty of action yet still a solid story line.  Nick Stahl and Clare Danes were spectacular.  You could really 'feel' for their characters.  I wanted to give ""John Connor"" a hug!  They both made me imagine what it must be like to go through this experience.When I see a sci-fi flick, it must be made in a way that I 'buy in' to it. Where my logic doesn't constantly take over and say 'that could never happen'.  This movie, like the previous Terminators is made so that I sit back and enjoy the movie and forget all the reality stuff.Terminator 3 also leaves plenty of room for a T4.  All I can say is, I HOPE they make a T4!  I want more!  My nephew agrees.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

I left feeling relieved and overjoyed -- ""they did it,"" was my only thought.  ""They made the sequel I would have made.""  And they really did.Whatever the critics say, know this: even James Cameron approves of Terminator 3.  It carries his vision forward perhaps as faithfully as he himself would have done.  There is the landmark humor, action, and, above all -- story.I have read complaints, from some critics, who seem to think T3 was meant to be a perpetually extended version of its predecessor, T2.  No.  T3 is in new hands; spawned entirely by new brains.  The ideas are fresh, and the scope? -- Extraordinary.It is perhaps the best Terminator movie yet.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
1252,steve-a-thomas,Surprisingly great 3rd installment,10,11 July 2003,"I have to say that I was not expecting a great movie with T3 ""Rise of the Machines"".  I was biased, thinking James Cameron was necessary to make it a success, but I was wrong.  The Terminator Story has taken a life of its own! It has evolved from the simple story-line of a single terminator trying to kill Sarah Connor to Skynet trying to kill all human life.  It is huge and the potential is vast.  Arnold Schwarzenegger's presence on screen was incredible.  For 55 years old, he is in excellent shape.  I highly recommend this movie to folks like me who don't think any movie can top T1 and T2. This movie isn't meant to top it, just continue it, and it does that very well.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

I thought it would not be good. However, i feel they did the series justice. I found the comical parts to be entertaining though sometimes hurt the mood of the movie. The chase scenes,particularly the first one, were a little different and not as monotonous as they have become these days. I would recommend this movie to anyone looking for a good time and that loves the terminator like myself.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
1254,bigrodrand,"An OK movie on its own weight, but not enough weight to carry on the Terminator Franchise",5,15 July 2003,"Previews didn't really wet my appetite to see this movie, but I just had to know what they did to continue the Terminator Franchise.  The film started off on the right track but quickly took a detour. It lacked the proper mood and style of the first two films had and definitely lacked the punch. Storylines seemed to be thrown together and loose ends were tied up with sloppy knots (if they were even tied up at all).  The acting in the film made up somewhat for the poor writing.  Arnold's lines may seem a bit corny these days, but he still kicks ass and you can't have a Terminator film without him. Nick Stahl did a decent job, but I wonder why they couldn't get Eddie Furlong. The Terminator X was kind of cool, but you can't beat the T1000 or Arnold's character in the first Terminator.  Claire Daines was a good addition to the movie.  Linda Hamilton's character is missed in this movie too.  All in all, if you like action with flat emotions behind it, it's not a bad movie.  But it was a horrible injustice to what its predecessors built.  The only intriguing event in the movie came with the ending scene. As good as it was, it was not good enough to save this film and continue the franchise.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
1255,keir_reynolds,"ARNOLD is BACK!!! Hey, we knew he would be...he told us so",10,9 July 2003,"The film runs close to 2 hours but with the pace of the action and the interesting storyline I found the movie to be over so quickly.
You can tell right away that T-3 was directed by someone different than the previous two. There is a different style. This movie has great atmosphere and doesn't take itself too seriously. The characters poke fun at themselves which makes this movie seem very fresh even though it is a 3rd installment.After a long dry spell and some health issues, ARNOLD is BACK!!! He makes his entrance into the movie with a nude scene similar to the opening of the prvious two Terminator's. You'll probably think as I did...""Wow, he looks ripped for 55!!!"" He has shrunken from his prime. You don't see much of Arnold's muscle after the first scene. He wears heavy black leather which can make one of those anorexic Tyra Banks model wannabe's look big. Most of Arnolds fight scenes are actually chasing scenes not requiring him to do much physical activity. Sure he is hanging from a crane be dragged through buildings but we all know that those are special effects...and not really him, let alone any other Mr. Universe.Said all this the movie is fresh, very entertaining and is the best of the big action movies so far!!! It does it's job and makes a case for a T-4. One question...if Arnold loves Hummer's so much why is he driving a Toyota Pick-up the whole movie? It would have been much more entertaining to see him ripping around the streets in one of those new Hummer H2's...GM could have brought out a special edition and call it an H3.

1257,abhor,Terrible,1,10 July 2003,"Let me start by saying that like many, I am a great fan of previous Terminator movies, and when I heard they are making a new Terminator I was very enthusiastic and imagined all the huge possibilities that movie could have.When I first saw that Terminator 3 is not directed nor written by James Cameron, my hopes came a bit down. When I saw that role of the evil terminator would be played by a model who has no acting experience I began to get the feeling how this movie would be. I tried to prepare myself for the failure for a long time. But nothing could prepare me for this... The movie was awful. I don't think I have ever been disappointed in any other movie this much.In T-3 they do everything I hoped they wouldn't do. They have added totally unnecessary humour in spots that it doesn't fit in at all. The script is terrible, and whole movie has no content. The movie totally lacks the dark and somewhat distressing feeling the previous Terminator movies had, especially the first one. When watching T-3 at some points I thought if they are serious about this movie at all. Kristanna Loken:s roleplay is plain annoying, every time she comes to screen she does something stupid... She has lines that a robot surely wouldn't say. Arnold Schwarzenegger is a bit better, but it's obvious that Cameron was the one who was keeping both the story and Arnolds roleplay together. Writers have tried to find new ""legendary"" comments but fail with an embarrassing way.Jonathan Mostow:s amateurish directingwork combined with low-class storywriters has made a sequel that totally ruins Terminator series and disrespects its great predecessors. All I can say is I hope I would have never seen this movie. If they do any more of these terrible sequels to get money by abusing the name, I will not watch them.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
1258,iconoclast101,Wouldn't change a thing,8,18 July 2003,"What an enjoyable experience - twelve years on and they succeeded in making a film that didn't ruin the story and at the same time delivers one hell of a fast-paced, monster of a movie. High Art it isn't, but the action is as good as it ever was and the warning against over-reliance on computers and machines is made again and made well. I came in with high expectations and wore a smile for the duration of T3. $10 to completely forget reality and lose oneself in cinema is money well spent. Most modern action movies fail to do that.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
1259,suzi_,Why this movie left me(huge terminator fan) disappointed **most likely some spoiler or two**,1,12 July 2003,"Ok. I am a HUGE sci fi fan and I love Terminator and T2. I had huge hopes for T3 but it just left me feeling REALLY REALLY EMTY.1st. The movie felt like it was cut. It felt like it was heavily cut. The movie runs for about 104 mins.. T2 ran for well over 2 hours atleast.The dialogue was at zero. And I suspect alot of plot never really got explored, like when T-X is sent to kill Connors officers.. She kills 2. And thats that.Furthermore there is no suspense no nothing like that. Remember T2? We didnt even know who was the good / Bad Terminator until Well 25-30 mins into the movie. Here The Biggest scene in the whole movie with the crane chase is well underway after 25-30 mins. It just feels like they rushed everything. Do the movie companies really give us so little credit nowadays so they think we wont sit thru a film unless it has action ALWAYS??Now to my biggest concern which ties to the cutting.The movie is basicly just ACTION non stop ACTION. I know you will say ok well its a good action movie. Yes i agree But this is terminator.. they had 12!! years to come up with a INCREDIBLE script. What we get is a script that is nonstop action no dialogue no plot no nothing except mindnumbing action.I mean first its the fight at the veterinarian, then they drive for what? 5 mins then they fight at the cemetary, then they fight at the military complex then they go to the fallout shelter and the movie is basicly Done. There is so minimal dialogue (ok i know im repeating myself) that I could puke. This is a Terminator movie not a action movie they should have done more.
And now to the minor stuff.Whats the deal with all these stuff that makes no sense. Like when he puts on these silly glasses the male stripper had then he takes them off and crushes them. Ok hes a ROBOT, does he have some coolness program he must obey? If he has a directive to wear glasses he should have worn these it would have made complete sense.Then whats the deal with counting how many cops hes killed?? I hate how movies these days have aboslutely no balls. Like when Spielberg replaced the rifles in E.T with walkie talkies.. This terminator was Sent fro the future he had NO directive not to kill cops he repeats his directives More then once i think and its solely to ensure that connor and his wife lives.

1264,LaurelGarlic,arnie sure has gotten old...,5,5 August 2003,"arnie sure has gotten old, hasn't he? in one way that's cool, but in another it just isn't, cause he doesn't look tough and evil anymore. i liked him very much in his last movie. and i have to say, that i like it. the way he is today he kinda looks cute, more teddybear like i mean. makes me kinda wanna kuddle with him... and that is almost the whole problem with terminator 3. he just isn't the terminator anymore, i think. he's cool with his sunglasses and his character has cool and funny lines in the movie like in the early ones, but it just isn't the same anymore. i also heard the stories about the film before i went to the cinema, that people told, like eddie furlong isn't doing the part of john anymore and it isn't a john cameron movie... and  stuff like that... but after i've seen it i realized that there are much bigger problems with the story and the whole invention of this movie: first thing is that even if i first thought i would miss edward furlong, i just wasn't nick stahl is cool, cause (like many people wrote before) he just IS the son of kyle reese... second comes the much bigger problem... the irresponsible decision of the writers, that sarah connor died of cancer... how much more obvious could you write a person out of the story, regardless what reasons there are, it's just ridiculous how they replaced one female counterpart of john with another, namely (although i liked the perfomance of claire danes quite much) third thing and for me the quite dissapointingst one is the lenght of the movie. i don't think that the movie would have been good under 125 minutes... the introduction of the characters and the story itself is good, but in absolutely no relation to the rest (the action- climax and showdownparts). i couldn't demand the length of the terminator 2 ultimate edition (although it wouldn't have been that bad) but at the end there isn't much story in this whole movie. i think it just isn't complex enough, and that is what i just can't understand... i mean james cameron can do dense, exciting and in no scene boring movies with much story and a length of almost 3h. and he did it a lot of times. (aliens, titanic, terminator 2) and i would think that he kinda thinks of terminator as one of the works of his lifetime, but why does he do such a thing with the terminator movies then? it's just sad... i liked the movie, but i think he just doesn't really like his terminator very much...",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

After T2 though you would have thought it was over and it had a happy ending hinting it was all over. Arnold has come back to protect John Connor from an even more powerful Terminator, which in my oppinion doesnt live up to the T-1000.  Yeah the T-X (Kristanna Loken) is amazing not to mention very attractive. The movie does have some errors from the whole story plot, but James Cameron didnt direct this one.  I felt this could have been better, but then again it shouldnt have been made.  T2 still in my mind remains the greatest Terminator movie ever and one of the best action films of all time.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
1266,kissfromcrys,It is what I expected,10,27 July 2003,"I have nothing bad to say about this film, perhaps except for its music, a bit boring. But ignore this weakness, everything is perfect.T-X is really a dangerous and hot and beautiful killing machine. I am wondering why there are some saying that T-1000 (T2) was more dangerous than T-X. She is ,T-X, is faster.And T-1000 did not have any gun and he could not bend his shape like T-X can.One more thing and is the most dangerous thing about T-X is she can control and give orders to other machines.This is very obvious, even Terminator was under her control to fight against John Corner.So do you guys think this female machine is more dangerous ? In T2, there was only one bad guy (T-1000). In this time, there are lots of killing machines controled by T-X.There are lots of hot actions that worth to see.I am very impressed when the two ultimate machines fighting each other. And when they chasing each other on the roads.And I think the end is very good.It gives us some to think of such as we are killing ourselves by our weapons and machines....Every actor in this film , I think, has completly accomplished their roles.Congratulations Go Cameron, I am waiting for T4. I give this movie 9/10",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
1267,saint_me,I think this is the ruins of it all.,3,2 August 2003,"As a big fan of the Terminator movies I was in awe of the possibility of a third installment.  Although the chance of wrecking those other two great movies was evident I was quietly hoping for another one.  As long as James Cameron, Arnold Schwarzeneger, Linda Hamilton and Edward Furlong were involved and they could explain how the machines have made a come-back decently I would be happy.  Two out of six just isn't good enough.Terminator 3: The Rise of the Machines is the biggest disappointment I think I'll ever have in my life.  Let's face it we all knew when James Cameron didn't sign up it was going in the wrong direction.  I just didn't realize HOW WRONG.  The appointment of Jonathan Mostow as director wasn't exactly showing the studio were moving hell and high water to give this movie any sort of chance.  Although I hear that the bigwigs cut Mr. Mostow's original T3 to shreds so maybe he isn't THAT bad.  Then we hear that Edward Furlong has been forgotten as John Connor because of drug problems.  Now I don't know about you but if I were in charge of a major franchise such as The Terminator, I would not change the face of the main character in the third movie.  It just cheapens the movie so much and when you go and hire Nick Stahl, a guy who looks nothing like Edward Furlong then your going the right way for a wrong Terminator sequel.  Maybe if the studio waited a few months and actually HELPED Edward out then this movie wouldn't be so fake to the real fans.  Most of you will know that Sarah Connor isn't in this movie. I don't want to spoil this big surprise that you have already worked out but I'll just say it's a storyline that I would be expecting from a Sons & Daughters TV soap episode, not a multi-million dollar budget action movie.Arnold Schwarzeneger makes his return as the terminator that we all love so dearly.  He enters in that chaotic fashion as in the first two films in the big disco-ball thingy.  Look at this scene and remember it as this is the last time you will have any sort of love for this movie.  Up comes the ""I need your clothes"" scene.  Humour they call it.  I can't describe the pain I felt while watching this bit...You'll have to experience it for yourself. Arnold isn't the same here.  In the other two movies he was believable and menacing.  His acting is truelly dire here and his character doesn't have any connections with the other's at all.  Where as in the second he was learning stuff and asking questions in this one he's just...there. Kristanna Loken.  She is a mobile phone with legs and a flamethrower compared to the T-1000 from Terminator 2.  Her part in the film makes no sense to me at all.  Skynet would not think that if the next assassin they send out had boobs it would have any sort of advantage.  No...the STUDIO thought that if they had a T-X with boobs they would pull in the male's who are guided by their ""other organ"" and maybe get a sponsorship deal with Kleenex Tissues when the DVD comes out.  The T-X isn't menacing, it isn't scary nor is it big or clever.  It's just...there.  For your viewing pleasure.  Please enjoy while I go throw up into a lucky-bag.Ah...John Connor.  Living ""off the grid"".  Now before this movie I was led to believe that he was trained ever since he was a small boy to be a huge commando leader type.  Instead we have a puny, moany, cry-baby wuss who I would be able to terminate with an elastic band and a paper-clip.  Nick Stahl isn't the same mould as Furlong.  He doesn't have that same street cred or charm.  He's just...there.  Now the storyline between him and Kate Brewster (Claire Danes) was pretty interesting but not enough to save this movie.  All Claire Danes did in this movie was scream and look horrified. It isn't asking much and well...she delivered.  Well done Claire!  You have just shown you are able to do the two most useful things a female can do in a male-dominated movie world.  Maybe you'll be in the next Scream sequel. *yawn*Now the special-effects were the main attraction of Terminator 2: Judgement Day.  I'm shure they will be passed off as the main attraction here as well. I just don't see why.  The fight scenes were just unbelievable...in a bad way, and the car chase scene although a good idea could have been filmed A LOT better.  To me it just isn't good enough.  You need a good director, good actors and a good script.  All three were atrocious here.  People who love this movie will hold the storyline and the apocalyptic ending (yeah you know how it ends) as their two shining good-points.  The storyline was pretty good but it sets itself up for a tire-some ""I seen this coming a mile away!"" ending that doesn't cut it.  People have been ending their movies on notes like this for so long I was shure it wouldn't be a surprise to anybody.  I haven't even mentioned the score being missing.  You would not believe how much this film misses it.  I was actually humming the tune to the start of the movie because it so obviously should have been there.Well to sum this movie up, I hated it with all my heart.  They ruined the first two classics and have the sheer audacity to set themselves up for a fourth.  Terminator fans will have to be given some sort of injection to let their grip be realised from the cinema-seats and the rest...well...they can just sit and enjoy their popcorn, the big explosions and the boobs like they are expected to.3/10",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
1268,cheggers,Arnie is still GOD.,8,1 August 2003,"Me and a couple of friends went to watch this last night with pretty low expectations. As major fans of the first 2 movies (and all Arnie's late 80's - early 90's outings)we couldn't see how a 56 year old could convince as a killing machine, and with no James Cameron at the helm and a GIRL (?) as the main nemesis things were looking less than promising. However, I'm delighted to say that I obviously know less than nothing as this movie absolutely ruled. Nobody else could play the title role period. Arnies performance was fantastic, shifting from  brutal, urinal over the head violence to real laugh out loud comedy with some of the coolest one-liners in recent memory. Nick Stahl and Claire Danes did well in their roles and the director stepped up a gear with some awesome, realistic (ok not realistic, but not 100% CG ala Matrix Reloaded) action sequences. All in all a pretty near perfect summer action movie, roll on T4. Last word however is reserved for the T-X, not only was she well tasty, (damn that long curly hair, always gets in the way)but she gave a convincing performance and more than held her own next to Arnie. Roll on Kristanna Loken in Striptease 2 - Return of the Tease!",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
1269,Movietruthseeker,Action packed! But it lacked the Worldly omnipresent feeling......,7,2 August 2003,YES Arnold is still imposing at 55! Kristanna Loken is gorgeous! decent performances by the cast all around.. the movie lacked a scene which involved thousands of people dying fleeing etc. at least thats what i expected..... the bathroom fight scene was one of the best ever! Arnold was very funny! this movie was fun but doesn't compare to T2!,Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
1270,ripper48,A classic continuation to a classic saga,10,6 August 2003,"This movie is really awesome. It's just that simple. Within the first 10 seconds of the film, I was totally hooked. I kept my eyes on the screen at all times.There is a ton of action, and a few very funny moments, but really, it doesn't take anything away from the very emotional and powerful story. This film is great.A few people seem to think that this film isn't as good as the others...I totally disagree. Give this film a few years, and it will become a classic, like the previous movies. T-2 took years to become a classic. Many people thought at first that it ruined the saga because it was the first time you saw the Terminator as a ""babysitter""...However, as the years went by, it became in many people's minds a classic. Give T-3 a few years, and it will become a classic too. It's an excellent film with strong messages and a strong story.10/10",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
1271,cassio77,about the movie,6,8 August 2003,"First of all, i´d like to say that I really love the whole history, I think that was the best science fiction history ever. But I have to say that I didn´t understand much it..the movie for me fails in many things, such as:..Jonh Connor should ´ve been edward furlong, , nick stahl was ridiculous(not him, but he wasn´t fit properly for the role and I don´t like changing actors in sequels for same role)...The movie let us many questions and I would like to somebody answer it:..What happened to the laboratory exploded in T2:..WHAT is the connection between Miles Dyson and the father of Claire?..for me, the way that the history is told in T3 sounds like one neverending story, every time that one terminator is sent to the past it is terminated and: should not the future be changed?...this is for me the message in T2, that the 3 chips were destroyed...the only reason for me to keep terminators being sent to the past is if we are dealing to many dimensions or parallel Worlds...now we have a situation:finaly, Judgment day is arrived..Could have enough space for T4?..I think that is the only reason to save the trilogy...happening in the future(now present)..the machines X humans....humans winning...so, the machines build the ultimate killer machine...a TERMINATOR made by light( i heard that this terminator would be the TX)..this Terminator tries to kill Jonh in the future, but for some reason it fails...so, it is sent to the ""many pasts"" to bring back all terminators (T1000, TX)...together with it, all these 3 terminators went back to 1984, to kill Sarah( they have, now all informations about her)...it´s up to jonh, arnie and clarie to go back and try to stop them.....what do you guys think...for T3 I give 3 stars in 5",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
1272,tiaselias,"What, no twist?",4,6 August 2003,"Any sequel needs a new, fresh, approach to either the story or its characters. Preferably both, of course... T3 lacks this, and is actually nothing more than a transportation to T4. Frankly, I was rather bored. Giving the TX a female gender is not a twist, actually it is hardly even variation, it is just boring. If anything, it is evidence that this Venus/Mars myth, which prevails in our society, is pure nonsense. (In case You had not found that out yet...) T4 has got the prerequisites of becoming another great movie, while T3 is but a story that has to be told in order to get a good basis for T4. This is unfortunate, but perhaps inevitable? Another thing that bothers me is Arnie's apparent personal influence on his own character, i.e. in the script. His ambiguity at the end of the movie messes up the ice cold logic of the plot, inherited from T1 and T2, which is a shame. Once re-programmed, he should act in accordance to that, without remorse. Personally, I would wish that Arnie's character was reduced to a minimum in the sequel(s) to come. The (great) overall story would gain tremendously from that.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
1273,MontyBigglesworth,It's a good cheap thrills comedy but no TERMINATOR film...,1,10 August 2003,"T3: I  knew it would be bad, I had heard what James Cameron thought about it so I was sort of prepared for a couple of hours of utter nonsense.To sum it up this film just feels cheap the whole way through. I don't mean the budget (which I am sure was 10 times the first one) but the acting the story the... well the whole film. If you were to remove the action scenes (which just didn't have the same richness as with James Cameron's in T1 and T2) you were left with a basis for a good film.There were some nice ideas, it's just a shame they left the idea of possibly making an interesting, intelligent classic masterpiece like the first two and went instead for the big action scenes to please the masses...As a Terminator film T3 sucked. It was appalling and I have no wish to ever see it again thank you very much.To try and be at all positive, if you ignored the fact that this film has ruined a potentially awesome trilogy (eg: ALIEN ALIENS ALIEN 3 not inc Resurrection) and look at it as a comedy it's not that bad. There are some quite amusing parts from Arnie. But like I said, it's not a touch on the first two and I don't want to see it again.Someone else on here mentioned the fourth film  may be better but I think it's best to put it to rest. Some things are best left alone.
We have found out that no one but James Cameron can do it, unless he is allowed to make his own version T3 lets save us any further embarrassment and bury the Terminator before it's too late.It is my fondest wish that Arnie wont be back...Thanks.Monty.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
1274,McWee0ne,Arnold for governor,6,11 August 2003,"It's unfortunate that movie opens with an intro that doesn't make much sence. Sure you get some information about judgement day as we all know it's what this movie is about. But after there short intro, you just get thrown into some action scenes with arnold vs Kristanna. And the story is left open for the second part of the movie. A very unfortunate factor according to me as I was sitting there waiting for the story while they were trashing vehicles and blowing up s***.However terminator three makes a good story after and the plot is nice. But try to tell the story of the movie to a friend. For some movies you can talk an hour. You need minute maximum to explain everything with this one. That's why I didn't really like the movie.Terminator is still one of the classics and excellent to see with a nice bag of popcorn.One thing is for sure... Arnold will be back, cause the movie just screams for another sequel. (If that'll be with arnold again as governors don't get too much time to act i guess ;) ).",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
1275,themods,The one sequel too many - Spoilers,5,26 November 2003,"I think there is an unwritten law about Hollywood that goes somewhat like: ""There can be only one good sequel."" On most occations sequels rarely surpass the original and I have to say my expectations were pretty high for a second sequel like T3 when I heard about it. After all Cameron has managed to make some fairly good sequels. Then I found out Cameron was not on the job. My expectations dropped. Not that I'm a Cameron fanatic, don't get me wrong - it's just that I had never even heard of Mostow before. Well let's make a long story short: I went to the movies and was at first pretty satisfied with the film. First impression good. However, the more I started analyzing it, the less I liked it. The plot was really just taken directly out of T2 and modified in a way to make it seem like new. Nothing new here, except this time the villain is in female form - that and John is older. By the time we get to the action (not too long) I started noticing how the pace of the movie has ruined it. The makers clearly thought that if there is enough action people forget about the plot holes. They had the inevitable car crashing bashing scene (please, haven't we seen enough of these already, they're in -every- action flick today!) and our heroes were so busy running around they didn't even have time to go over the situation. Character development: totally unbelievable (can't say more, I'd be spoiling). They couldn't make the story hold anymore, and what's worse it's still left open for a fourth episode. The only part about this movie that I really enjoyed was Arnold. He is the sole reason to see the movie. His one-liners and cheesy accent are still worth a couple of laughs. And he does have a few new ones too. All in all, the movie was ok, but that's just it. It wasn't great like it's predecessors. And I'm not going to say Cameron could have saved it, but I'm saying maybe Cameron had a reason for dumping the project. Compared to some other action movies today T3 is actually quite descent, but it doesn't even nearly live up to the greatness of T2 or the freshness of T1. If all you care for is action though, you could do a lot worse. grade: C",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
1276,Terminaisha,What the hell was that?,1,15 August 2003,"After seeing T2 on video, complete with directors cuts, I though T2 was the best movie I'd ever seen in my life. Emotion mixed with action, complete with plot and believeable characters. Great! So I was all hyped up when T3 came out, and went to see it at the first showing in my cinema... I came out thinking why was that so good? Where did the $185m budget all go? It was all just blowing stuff up. Even the T-x was a disappointment- she just didn't seem that much more advanced (compared to the T-1000). And John... the way he acted just didn't seem like John! He wasn't the way I thought he'd be... Basically, I thought T3 was pretty rubbish, and to me it was a big disappointment. The storyline was... well, nonexistant, the dialogue (especially from the T-800) sounded forced and like they were just going for the jokes. Terminator is not a comedy, so don't try and make it one! Any humour that should be in it comes naturally. And that's about all I have to say...",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

Why saying ""I'll Be Back"" and ""She'll be Back"". Just a few moments that made me a little nervous. The pressure from the first and the second part wasn't so great here because of these comedy elements.

Mostow has allowed my faith in him to decline rapidly.  The biggest mistake of the film is writing off Linda Hamilton and picking up Claire Daines in her place.  The thing that is different about this movie from the others is that the others were believeable to a degree.  This one just sucked.  It goes back and John is yet again in denial that machines exist...hello you saw one a few years back.  It basically all plays out too movie-ish....it could have been better and the whole idea of changing there is no fate..to there is fate and you can't do a thing about it was really dumb.  NO FATE...come on J. Mostow....did you even watch the other movies???? Note in making sequels you have to follow the rules...we don't want a completly sucky movie as part of the series...all in all it was ok...too much was changed but it was a good movie ne way....btw...I never once feared that TX would catch them...a woman terminator just wasnt' scary enough for me.,Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
1282,mrkjcs23,best movie of the year!,9,12 November 2003,"After 12 years, i was surprised that a 3rd Terminator movie was actually being made. The Terminator is the classic among action movies. Terminator 2:Judgment Day really stood the test of time to this day, and I believe that it surpassed the original, with a more in-depth storyline and characters, as well as a great performance by Robert Patrick as the liquid metal terminator. Terminator 3:Rise of the Machines takes the series to a whole new level. it has a lot more in common with T2 than #1. in my opinion, i think it was the most enjoyable of the 3. Arnold Schwarzenegger was perfectly natural at the role of the Terminator as always. Nick Stahl did a good job as John Connor. Claire Danes did a pretty good job introducing Kate Brewster. and it was good to see Earl Boen, who is the only actor besides Arnold to be in all 3 of the films, make an appearance once again as Dr. Silberman. but the one who really left a huge impression in my mind was Kristanna Loken as the T-X. i think her performance is amazing and her character outdoes that of the one from T2 played by Robert Patrick. she should at least get an Oscar nominee for that performance. she's an excellent actress, and i hope to see more of her soon. the movie also had some great action sequences, including the unforgettable one in the cemetery. it's definitely one of the best and most unique action sequences i've ever seen, and i've watched countless action movies, from the low-budget, video-only ones to the smash hits at the box office. i bought the DVD yesterday and it was very interesting to listen to the commentary by Schwarzenegger, Kristanna Loken, and the others. Terminator 3 was definitely a lot better than any other movie i've seen this year, and better than most i've seen in the past several years. it had a good ending that left hinting at another sequel. hopefully Arnold will be back for the main role if a 4th one is ever made, it just wouldn't be the same without him. also, it would be great if they brought back Kristanna Loken to play another female Terminator-she's perfect for the role.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

If any of the lame jokes that found their way into the movie were actually funny then maybe it wouldn't have been so bad but ""talk to the hand?""  Give me a break.  That whole morality issue they tried to impart on the terminator this time was incredibly funny though.  Unfortunately it wasn't meant to be.  And why did they send back a wrinkly, less muscular terminator this time?

1285,ByRdMaN86x,Thank God,7,26 January 2004,"Let me first start by saying, Thank god this movie did not ruin the Terminator saga. For years I've been waiting for this film to arrive, and ever since it was first announced I never had negative thoughts on this movie. After those 3 years of waiting, I must say that I'm impressed by Mostows final product. No, it's not a Masterpiece like James Cameron's first two installments, buts its a worthy sequel. Alot of people have complained that there are too many plot holes, but there are no fewer plot holes than that of its 2 predecessors. The screenwriters and Mostow handled the continuation of T2 well. Don't get me wrong, this movie has its flaws, and YES James Camerons touch is missing, but does that make it a bad movie? No. 12 years is a long time to make a sequel, and based off of how poor some sequels are, I'm glad this one ended up a winner, box-office wise and critic wise. So on that note, congrats Arnold, Nick, Kristana, Clair etc...We now have another worthy entry into the collection of Sci-Fi trilogies.

It has used a name ""Terminator"" to make millions on a story that realistically is not worth the paper its written on. Im surprised that Arnold would even attach his name to this film, but undoubtedly a six figure number probably helped. It is rubbish. Poor acting coupled with a poor script leads to disastrous affects! as we clearly see in this movie. The fact that we have a woman terminator making mince meat out of Arnold (the figure) that James Cameron spent so much time making a legend of in the first to films. Instead of being the man of steal that we admired in the first two films Arnold is now more like a cross between Ricky Gervais and Vinnie Jones.

1289,richardson1078,Take it for what it is,9,25 March 2004,"I have come across quite a few people who disliked this movie. Their reasons are numerous: plot holes, it destroys the continuity, etc. I could go on and on but I will not do that here.I think the biggest problem that most people had going into this film was that they were expecting it to be something that it wasn't. They were expecting this movie to be another Terminator 2: Judgment Day. This movie, I believe, was never meant to be that. It did have likenesses to the other movies such as action sequences, time travel, etc. However, this movie needs to be judged on its' own merits and not that of the two movies preceding it, to do this is about as intelligent as judging a child against the performance of his/her siblings.I think that all parties involved in the making of this film did an excellent job in making a film that held up rather well. A good job was done of creating something that added to the Terminator storyline but still was original enough to be a good movie in its own right. Some familiar concepts in the Terminator Universe were taken and expanded on or better defined. It seems that most of the problems that I have heard from others who have viewed the film have come from their own preconceived ideas about what certain aspects of the film or Terminator Universe should be and not from the film itself.Therefore my recommendation about this movie is to simply take the film for what it is, entertainment. This is a good phrase to sum up what I think. As entertainment this movie holds up rather well. Take it for what it is and enjoy it. Don't beat your brain out trying to understand it because it is only a movie. Overall I think this was a good movie 7/10",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
1290,heather_alien,Just a low-quality thing...,3,30 December 2004,"T2 was just a snotty family movie, but you must admit it was a high-quality snotty family movie. If somebody wanted to defile everything with a gloomy hopeless secondary concocted thing (and nobody had any doubt that it would be a gloomy hopeless secondary concocted thing), they could at least try and make a high-quality one. And what did we see? We are absolutely lost in time-travel and alternative universes. That's very good. If we were not lost, we would clearly see how stupid all this stuff is. I will kill you in the future, because you will trust me after the story that was in the second film. All right. I'd like to see how he trusted him after he had told him (in the third film) that he would kill him. Or was it in one more alternative universe? Naturally, it was, in that universe all these young people had not been killed. And what will he do without them? Down with them, it's his problem, there's no fate, but he is doomed to save the humanity, so don't be afraid, he will save it! Schwarzenegger. We all know, that all his heroes are in fact one and the same hero, and he has only two ways in this situation: self-parody and self-plagiarism, and while the first is fun, the second is annoying. Now we see that he invited the third way: plagiarizing parody. Who needed it? Not me. It was just another way to make a connection with T2, and it didn't work, because it is a different film in a different era. Then, it is just badly done. Yes, they crashed much more cars, but why the chases in the first two films are as much more thrilling as less cars were broken there? They could just have rolled all those cars off a cliff without shooting it - with the same use, maybe, even with more use, because they would at least have had fun themselves. So many details that don't fit each other, the first two films and the reality, that it would be an even longer post if I tried to recall all of them. I still hope some of them are just a problem of the translation, but the other cannot be. Why such crude work? You probably remember that moment it T2, where a song begins with a new scene, ""Bad to the bones"" or something like that. What we find in this film? Another song, switched on in a somehow similar frame. But that one was as organic as a fragment of a song in the middle of a movie can be, and this one just strikes eardrums with no sense. All this ""primary weapons"", broken lavatory pans, fragile flying machines, mysterious blinking stands... It resembles a cheesy shooter video game much more than a film. Maybe, it was their primary target: to make a film easily transforming into a video game. But I am not going to play this game, neither I want to see the film many times.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
1291,deftones_adrenaline,T3: A systematic breakdown on why this film sucks from a Terminator FAN,3,15 October 2006,"Reasons why this film is crap...1. The Terminator (Arnold) is a T-101 in Terminator 3...(bashes Mr. Mostow in the skull) NO! NO! NO! In T1 & T2, the Terminator is a T-800: Cyberdyne Systems MODEL 101. If you can't get the BASIC facts straight, you shouldn't assume the helm of any major and beloved franchise! 2. Linda Hamilton (Sarah Connor) turned down an initial version of the script because T3 portrayed Sarah Connor as a weaker character while maintaining the ""weak"" John Connor.3. Make way for Katherine Brewster, John Connor's ""Sarah-Connor-wanna-be"" wife, who saves his ass constantly. Yes, saves John Connor, the future military leader! The character, John Connor, is completely subdued in T3.4. The gay stripper at the male strip club with the star sunglasses? No! The whole reason the Terminator ever started wearing sunglasses is in T1 when he had to disguise his face after his eye cover was damaged and he couldn't ""blend in"" with society. In T2, the sunglasses weren't necessary either, but the Terminator didn't have the glasses on for much of the movie. Talk to the hand? Completely unnecessary and an ancient phrase at that! 5. ""She'll be back?"" Stop with the catch phrases of ""...be back."" 6. The premise of the Terminators in the past is to blend in with society while hunting and killing their prey. The T-X is a ""down grade"" from the T-1000 in T2. She has weaponry built in (doesn't fit in at a dinner party) and an endoskeleton under liquid metal. One aspect made known in T2 was the fact that the T-800 endoskeleton could be harmed and wear-out opposed to the T-1000 which was pure liquid metal, no skeleton to be beaten. The T-1000 could take tons of Damage and no sign of being harmed.There are a few more reasons. I know people will attack this post, but I am fundamentally correct in my statements. Audiences crave seeing films like T3: Rise of the Machines and Superman Returns even though they are pretty much, but not completely, crap because people just want to see Superman fly again or see the Terminator back in action! Damn the good characters and the good story lines that made people love the original films to start with. The more things change...the worse they get!",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

What did they do to it!! Terminator was no longer the serious and heroic character, he was a stupid clown in screen! They messed it up. The movie s*cked not a little, but just a lot! Great special effects indeed but almost all day light scenes, comic and stupid look for terminator, lost characters, no emotion, no intensity, no fear, nothing. All the great master piece created by James Cameron in Terminator 1&2 was lost! I'm sorry to say but if you have not seen the movie and loved the first 2, don't watch it, trust me! This movie was made with one thing in mind, MONEY. They did not care about the story, the thriller or the characters. Just the money. NO wonder Cameron did not direct the third part, he wrote the story for and to finish in 2 movies, they just wrote on top to do the third one!Terminator 3, is not just the worst of all the terminators but a waste of time to watch. Other low budget action flicks, including Terminator 1 itself do 10 times better than this. I just hope that they do not go for Terminator 4, I would not take the risk to see it. Terminator 3 is just ""rubbish"" to see. I give it a 4/10 because of the special effects and Arnold, its not his fault after all!",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
1293,reptile256,the fall of the great terminator,4,5 December 2004,"When i finally got the chance to see it, I was really disappointed. It felt like i was watching Godzilla VS King Kong, starts with action and doesn't stop right till the end of the movie. There was just one non-action scene as far as i can remember. I was expecting at least some more info about the rise of the machines and possibly time travel, so we have something new to taste... but nooo... some things i liked though, maybe the way how arnie came back in the game, the terminator woman did a great job of acting, but the movie couldn't provide the atmosphere of the previous two.If you like action popcorn movies with really expensive effects, go for it... otherwise, rather go see the second or the first in the series again...",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
1294,j_zak,Summer blockbuster,8,27 October 2006,"Fanatic fans of the 2 previous Terminators may be disappointed, but I think there are no big reasons to be. We need to overlook some logical mistakes, and then we have here a good film and blockbuster for summer night. There are many actions such as scene with the fire department-car, these are one of the main parts of the film. The plot-line is only support for the show. Regarding actors, Nick Stahl, Claire Danes are average, Arnie plays his standard (like the old times :) and Kristanna Loken as marvelous T-X didn't need some special acting, she did empty face good :). So if you don't have big demands, you will not be disappointed..BTW Kristanna Loken is very cute :)",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
1295,silent_poet04,"A Good Movie, yet A Flawed Story",6,5 April 2005,"When I first heard of Terminator 3, I must say that I was surprised. Didn't the second one sum everything up nicely? I went to see the film with a large amount of doubt and misgivings. However, I was surprised. The acting was pretty decent (except for Claire Danes, ugh) and Nick Stahl does a decent job of portraying John Connor. The Terminatrix is sleek and powerful, and the creativity behind this machine is very well thought out. However, there is a major hole in this story. One of the beginning lines is this: John Connor says that ""when I was 13, another Terminator was sent to kill me as a teenager. I was protected by a Terminator."" However this cannot be true because of the simple fact that in T1, it begins in May 1984 (dialogue between Reese and the cop says so) so therefore Sarah could not have given birth to John until 1985. In fact in T2, when Robert Patricks liquid terminator character looks John up in the police computer, it says John birthday is 2/10/85. So, when John was 13 that would make the year 1998. Wait just a minute though. Judgement Day, according to Arnold's character, occurs on August 27, 1997. Whoa, talk about not thinking through the entire story before you write it! Holy snap! Also, in T3, Sarah Connor dies in 1997. Believable, only except for the fact that John says in T3 that Sarah battled Leukeimia for 3 years after the doc gave her 6 months to live. So, if the T3 storyline is true, Sarah died when John was 16! In 2001! But she couldn't have died then because in T2 Judgement day was supposed to happen August 27, 1997. Yes, I know they stopped it and all that, but apparently, the writers in T3 had that happen in 1998. So apparently the writers could have done a lot better job. In fact, another thing is John is supposed to be 23 in this movie. That would make the year 2008. So if John was born in 1985 (according to information given in T1 and T2) that would make the information (age-wise) accurate. So why the heck couldn't they make everything else accurate? Let's just hope that for T4 (which is in production) that they think the script through a little bit better, and try to keep it true to the story that James Cameron developed. Let's face it, his was a lot better.The SFX were incredible, especially the high speed chase scene about half an hour in. The story (except for the flaws mentioned above) was touching and remarkably well done. I loved the ending scene, where you see the nuclear warheads falling at various locations around the world. Overall this was not a terrible movie. I don't think it held up to the first two, but it is a good continuation. My Rating: **1/2 out of ****",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
1296,acp-cal,Introduced me to Terminator!,6,23 March 2015,"Sometime in 2006 i discovered this film funny actually before the others and i loved well back then t3 was my favorite film and i watched it at least 20 times in my high school years.Thinking back now it wasn't a bad film a good action flick with shootouts explosions neighborhood vehicle battles, just fun action! I think the thing got me to so enjoy it was the robots/terminators they're so cool and definitely the nude one (T-X. Kristanna Loken) haha.So i finish by saying the first 2 were amazing and had a more gripping story lines but T3 introducing me to Terminator deserves a look at!7.3 1/2 out of 10",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
1297,cnyldz,why did you make this movie?,4,25 April 2005,"Once upon a time there was a movie called "" Terminator 2: Judgement Day "" and it was watchable nice movie. Then the makers of that movie didn't think that the money they earned from this movie wasn't enough and you know what kind of a money I am talking about... Then they made this following movie "" Terminator 3: The Rise of The Machines "" and they made the 2. movie loose its good appearance on people' s minds. I only vote this movie 4 points because the special effects are very good. But the scenario is really awful... And I also protest Arnold Schwarzenegger by not watching his movies anymore because of supporting a holocaust which DOES NOT EXIST. I think he should read more history books instead of spending time on body building, before starting to support an idea like that.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
1298,black_picasso3000,T2 should have been where the story ended...,3,13 May 2005,"I loved the first 2 films and I was very excited about the possibility of a T3. After T2 I figureed things were over. When I heard the rumors of a T3, I wondered how it could be possible after the way T2 ended. Was there another chip, was there something left at the metal plant, etc. I was curious to see why. So I was understandably shaken when the premise for the whole film was summed up in 1 line. I felt like getting up and walking out at that point. There was no real tension, not much terror and how scary is it to have a supermodel chase around a dude, his future wife and a robot? . I think the franchise should have ended after T2 and this was an obvious attempt for Arnold to get 1 last great payday before going into politics full time.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
1299,germfogg,Best movie ever,10,18 May 2005,"Many action scenes, sticky phrases, explosions, robot fighting, muscle, humor, drama, hot girl, etc. The classic Schwarzenegger action movie! The new terminator ""TX"" its a cold beautiful woman, and Arnold looks exactly the same as 10 years ago, that would stun you for sure. The DVD i have (region 4 South America, Australia)has the greatest extras I've ever seen, the menus, Skynet database, Terminator timeline, make your own special FXs, preview of Mc Farlanes toys, hilarious scenes, how special FXs where made, etc. It also has very interesting comments in movie by the director an the actors and its translated in many languages, the Spanish voice acting its great, the voices are very similar to the real actors. A must have for any Terminator fan!",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
1300,dbruce-89348,Not true to the original creator's vision,2,2 August 2015,"Okay this movie really disregards the previous ones in the series. Terminator 1 & 2 basically said Judgement Day could be prevented whereas this movie basically says it could only be postponed. So what was the point of the first two movies of doing all that fighting against the terminators if it would only lead to Judgement Day getting postponed?Lines of dialogue where really cheesy, I mean the terminator says to a convenience store clerk who confronts him for shoplifting, ""Talk to the hand."" Seriously. The film also felt like it was directed by Michael Bay rather than Johnathan Mostow due to all the freaking explosions and other excessive destructive special effects. Yeah I know there's going to be destruction inherently because that's what the war of machines is about but to have all this repetitive focus on it makes it annoying and boring rather than cool and emotion grabbing.I felt John Conner and Kate Brewster were rather lame characters in this movie, I mean I just didn't feel the awesomeness that they were supposed to portray. So in conclusion, the plot, characters, and dialogue of the movie SUCKED and didn't hold true to the previous movies. The music, effects were about the only thing that were good.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines
1301,Jeremylamm04,Another sequel screwing up the first 2....,1,1 August 2005,"When I first heard they were making Terminator 3 I shook my head in disgust. T2 is my favorite movie of all time and to top it would be impossible, not because Cameron is this all-mighty director, although he is very good, but that the movie was just done too well in T2. From the directing, acting, plot, the score, everything. T3 has none of these traits and that's what makes it a garbage movie.I hate how Hollywood lets movies like this be created and ruin the image behind the first two completely. Just like the Alien movies, the first two were ruined by the memories of the last two. It's too bad that directors would rather make money than let people remember what the good movies stood for. On to crap 3. T3- First off, where is the music? The theme that the die-hard Terminator fans have known to love wasn't until the ending credits. Not that that makes a movie but I was looking forward to hearing it in the beginning. Not only that but there was a no music until about half-way in the movie it seemed like. It was just quiet and lame.The beginning scene was total ridiculous. He goes into the male strip bar only to say talk to the hand and NOW! to his hand. It was so lame and a complete rip-off of the T2 bar scene.The movie also have a very rush feeling to it to me. There was no character development what-so-ever. The love story didn't flow at all. Her fiancé is killed and she really didn't show any remorse or sadness that he was dead for more than a few seconds. When the Terminators first come together and the truck bounces over the girl I think I laughed out loud at how stupid that was. Not only that but the TX wasn't even scary to me and seemed less advanced than the T-1000. Robert Patrick was far more freaky as the creepy T-1000 than that girl ever was. Also, the T-1000 really couldn't be damaged. You could slow him down by freezing him or shooting but he always came back together because he was liquid. The TX was still metal underneath and could be damaged, which didn't seem more advanced to me. They couldn't come up with a better idea than the T-1000 though so they create this crap of combining the two Terminators into one. Retarded.The humor in the movie was terrible and really took away from the Terminator feel in my opinion. The Terminator is supposed to be a killing machine, ruthless, relentless, careless. But this Terminator was cracking jokes and not really hurting anyone. In T2 it made sense but only because John was teaching him not to hurt people, and he still did. Also, when the Terminator was carrying the coffin and shooting at the police why didn't he kill anyone? Again, this made no sense because John didn't teach him not to do this so why didn't he kill anyone? I can't comprehend how people like this crap.I think a major clue that the movie was going to suck before even seeing it was that it was rated PG-13. Any movie called ""Terminator"" should automatically be rated R. The other movies were more violent whereas this Terminator was a damn kids movie. Since when were Terminator movies supposed to be funny? What are they having the Terminator cracking jokes? In the second movie it made more sense because John was teaching the Terminator human speech. In this one he was just throwing out lines with no one teaching him anything. I wanted to throw a knife at the screen this movie was so bad.One thing that I didn't get is that all of a sudden in this Terminator film he can crash through pretty much any wall, smash marble, get beaten to a pulp and he is fine, not to mention put his head back on after it was knocked off which makes no sense, and fight his programming. The film was complete garbage and frankly I'm shocked that as many people liked it as I see on this board. I read people said he was a different model from the other Terminators, but when did they ever explain that in T3? Makes no sense.I have a theory that most people enjoy crap movies with no plot and just mindless action. Sadly, this is true because people would rather be entertained than have to think and this is a prime examples of that. Just like many people liked the trashy movie Independece Day because it ""kept your attention"", the same people like T3 because of the lame car chase, or the fight scene between the TX and the Terminator.I watched the making of T2 and Cameron had first written the script to have T2 as the final Terminator. The beginning scenes were actually Conner and team taking over Skynet and destroying it and finding unused 101's, and that's when he sent it back in time. However, that was cut due to run time of the movie. I for one am going to pretend T3 does not exist and that they did in fact stop the war in T2 because I can's stand the idea of T3. I wish I could go back in time and stop this movie from being created. I give it -10 out of 10. Utter garbage.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

I like it because of the advanced technology used in the movie, I have watched it a lot of times. Some people say it is a bad movie, but my opinion is that it is a great movie. The bad thing is that I find it boring sometimes, probably because I watched it a lot. I also really like the Terminator T- X. I really recommend that movie. It is in my list of favorite movies. I also think that it is some of the best Terminator movies. I try to never miss it on TV. I enjoy watching it with my friends and family.

1304,dotsylvie,Terminator 3 destroys the franchise,4,14 September 2005,"I was really looking forward to the prospect of a third instalment to the Terminator series, but when i read that it was to be a 12A rating, i was outraged. There's no need for it, is there. If you look at the 3rd movie it tells you all. It has an edgy and out of touch storyline. It's not directed by James Cameron, it was left for 12 years to be revisited, it has no Linda Hamilton, no Edward Furlong(they left it to late for him, not seeing the inevitable, that he would end up in rehab)and the main attraction and the only attraction is a 56 year old Terminator who is on the verge of bowing out of the industry(Arnie). These are not the things that frustrate me in a big way, i'll tell you what it is, it's the films disgraceful attention to detail: 1) Nick Stahl(John Connor) says that the Terminator visited him first when he was 13, when anyone who actually watched T2 will know that John was 10 in the 1995 based Terminator 2, and he would have had to have been 10 because his mother, Sarah fell pregnant with him in late 1984(shown in Terminator). 2) It says on Sarah Connors coffin that she was born in 1959 and died in 1997 from leukaemia. She wasn't born in 1959, she was 19 in 1984, that was explained in T2, she had to be born in 1964 or 1965. 3) John says in T3 that his mother contracted Lukemia in 1994, and died from it shortly after the predicted Judgement Day. Now if that's the case why wasn't this mentioned in 1995 based T2, well i'll tell you why, they didn't expect Linda Hamilton to turn down the 3rd movie role, so they created some bull crap story to cover up her disappearance. I didn't reckon much of Nick Stahl's dry performance and i think that Director Jonathan Mostow & writers John Branicato, Michael Ferris & Tedi Sarafian should give each other some hard slaps and be cast out of the movie making industry for ruining a franchise by making the third instalment having never watched the first two movies. They just wanted to make money, they don't care about those hardcore fans, they don't love films, they mock the industry. 12A gets the kids in, gets the money in, takes the brilliance out.

And best ending anywhere.Downside? Yeah, there's one. No Linda Hamilton. She needed to be here with Nick Stahl. But otherwise, kicks @$$. Bring on T4 now, please.Comedy was a nice reprieve from the jaw-dropping action. So it was welcome there.Am pretty sure some of the $175 million was pocketed, though. No way in hell did all that money go for the film itself. Oh well. That's Hollywood, I guess.But either way, bring on T4 with or without Arnold.

1306,hanzo0313,Some thoughts about T3,9,7 May 2007,"I think the director of T3 just gave up doing one thing that other series movie director want to do. That is, ""N+1 should be better than n"". Yes, T2 is fantastic, outstanding, classic of all time, or simply-invincible. Trying to make more effects, explosions will not make any good, so why not ignore T2 and tell a whole new story for upcoming T4, T5? If you consider T3 as a introductory to the real judgement day, T3 has many clues and foreshadowing which can be developed for John Connor.But I still can not imagine how John lead the mankind to fight back. With some home-make bombs? And in T3, Skynet only has some prototype of T1 in 2003, that's a little bit too weak. Remember, T-800 are supposed to conquer the Earth in early 21st! Maybe John did see 2 terminators and know how they were terminated, but that's far far away from fighting back by a resistance leader who only know how to make dynamics!",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

1308,lunatic_goblin,Faithful add-on to Terminator series,10,10 December 2005,"I went to see this movie with open-arms and was rewarded with a wonderful action film (the best in the year) that totally lived up to the hype and my expectations.The CG is far superior to T1 and T2, and the acting never had any embarrassingly corny lines--like Terminator 1 (and the romance never did it for me in that film).The new Terminator (TX) is played rather well by Kristanna Loken, and the design of this cyborg is fantastic---a noted improvement from the T-1000, who I thought was a bit of a wimp.Of course, this movie belongs to Arnie, who commands the screen and has some very good scenes. As for Stahl and Danes, they are perfectly cast, and Stahl is a relief from someone who thought the Edward Furlong John Connor was pretty painful.Those two actors really do play second fiddle to the action here, which looks spectacular, and sadly (for some) does not leave as much room for character development as T1 and T2.However, if you're interest in the Terminator series is generally for the action and less about whether Terminators ""really can love and learn the value of human life"", then you will absolutely adore this movie, and without a doubt find it a welcome addition to the former 2.If, you are an aficionado of the series, you will be hard-pressed to find the human elements of the former two movies, although it goes without saying that there is a ton of information about the Machine uprising here that you would do well to take into account.I personally loved this film, and, while not yet considered the classic of T1 and T2, it is only a matter of time.",Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines

Also a neutral country can not comment on this because you don't have the nuts to choose sides. We bailed Europe out of speaking German twice so thats why the flag flies. When Sweden starts making movies that cost more than 100 million dollars then you can fly your own flag and maybe just maybe you can stop bashing the American flag.

It is an insult to the first two excellent movies. Personally I would of preferred it if they simply left it at two movies, this third instalment makes fun of a lot of the stuff that made the first two movies cool. It is more of a comedy than anything else and a bad one at that.
