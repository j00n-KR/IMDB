0,TheLittleSongbird,Lavishly produced and passionate telling of the Arthurian legend,8,1 June 2010,"I don't think Excalibur is a perfect movie, the pacing is rather dizzying not always the characters to fully develop as they could have done and the rape scene was horrible to watch and out of place. Flaws aside, it is lavishly produced, passionate and thoroughly convincing and is one of the better tellings of the Arthurian legend. Out of all the scenes in the film, Arthur and Guinivere's wedding was my favourite, it was beautifully done. As I have said, the film looks lavish, with sumptuous costumes and sets and mystical cinematography, and the score and battle scenes are excellent. The story is ambitious yet compelling, the direction is gritty mixing fable and magic with reality and the writing is intelligent. I also loved the themes presented in Excalibur, good vs. evil, paganism vs. Christianity and mighty Merlin vs. malevolent Morgana. And of course the acting is very good, Nigel Terry as King Arthur, Helen Mirren as Morgana and Nicol Williamson as Merlin particularly impress. All the characters are flawed and sympathetic, yet very intriguing as well. I loved Cherie Lunghi's Guinevere as well, she was beautiful. Overall, a solid telling of the legend of King Arthur. 8/10 Bethany Cox",Excalibur
1,bkoganbing,Long Cinematic Life To The Table Round,7,7 March 2010,"Nigel Terry who made his feature film debut as a real future King of England as Prince John in The Lion In Winter gets to play the legendary King Arthur in yet another retelling of the story in Excalibur. Terry joins such screen and stage Arthurs as Richard Burton, Richard Harris, Mel Ferrer and Brian Aherne.When we first see Terry as Arthur, he's not too different from Prince John, a callow youth and a bit on the dumb side. Over Excalibur's running time we see Terry move quite beyond that to a wise Arthur who gets betrayed by his friends and his love for them as well.Quite a contrast between the real King John and the mythical Arthur for the same player. But the Arthurian legend fascinates them across the pond. England and Scotland have had all kinds of rulers, some good, some really bad ones as well. Arthur serves as a kind of standard for rulers to behave. He's also a warning that even virtue has its traps.Nicholas Clay and Cherie Lunghi make a most attractive Lancelot and Guinevere, the knight whom Arthur prized and who brought down Camelot for his love for the beautiful queen. Nicol Williamson is a wise and elusive Merlin and in early roles before stardom are Patrick Stewart as Guinevere's father Leodegrance and Liam Neeson as Sir Gawain.However stealing the film in every scene she's in is the future Queen Elizabeth and future Inspector Jane Tennyson, Helen Mirren as the evil half sister Morgan LeFay. That woman's got one powerful lot of hatred to do what she did, engage in incest with her half brother Arthur and father the son who will destroy him.Robert Addie as Mordred gives an interesting interpretation of Mordred as a spoiled rotten youth, but for me the only Mordred is Stanley Baker in Knights Of The Round Table.Excalibur did get one Oscar nomination for Cinematography, but it lost in that category to another film that had a great historical sweep and a real one, Reds.This will be far from the last film that explores the myth of Arthur, what the British see as their ideal of a just ruler.",Excalibur
2,Leofwine_draca,Some very good material here - a shame it's so long-winded and drawn out,5,9 July 2016,"A worthy but slightly dull adaptation of the Arthurian tales, this is both overblown and overlong but not without its high points. Unfortunately the film drags on endlessly and is packed with interchangeable characters you don't really know or love. As with the director's EXORCIST II: THE HERETIC, there are some moments of undeniable beauty, and the film has fine camera-work throughout. I always get the impression that director John Boorman would be much better as an art director than a film director as all of his movies tend to be on the artistic side visually and Excalibur is no exception.Here the lush greens of the generally forested locations in which the movie is set are brought to the fore. Boorman decided to make his movie as realistic as possible, which is why the magic involved is understated and there are no monsters. Some may favour his authentic approach but personally I think a few monsters could liven things up no end here. Who cares if you stray from the text? The Arthurian legends had already been filmed so many times already that any deviation could only have been a good thing.With Boorman at the helm, you know you're in for one dark and occasionally disturbing ride and Excalibur is no exception when it comes to the inherent horror of the tale. In the action sequences, which are splendidly done, gore flows freely from cracks in armour and you never forget the mortality of the characters involved. Everything in the tales is present and correct, from the Sword in the Stone, to Merlin and Morgana, the wizard and witch, the Lady of the Lake and the search for the Holy Grail. The latter search occupies the second half of the film and includes my favourite scene, in which intrepid knight Perceval discovers a grotto in the woods from which hang the rotting corpses of knights who have previously come to claim the Grail. Boorman even has a crow pecking an eyeball from one of the corpses in a moment of extreme disgust which is welcomed by this horror fan.Cast-wise, Nigel Terry is just as strong-hearted and powerful as he should be in the role. He makes a fine transition from fresh-faced youth to wise old King and his acting is bolstered by fine make-up work which convincingly turns him from a teenage boy to a man of middle-age and beyond. Nicholas Clay is a mysterious and unusual Lancelot, not the knight in shining armour so usually portrayed in these adaptations (well he does have the shining armour but he's not exactly the heroic type throughout). Helen Mirren is perfectly cast as the creepy and evil Morgana, although I'm not too convinced about the accuracy of the cheesy fishnet costume she wears - it looks too '80s, that's all. One misstep I feel is Nicol Williamson, who plays Merlin with over-the-top relish. His is a character I just can't take seriously, and I don't think Williamson did either. He just comes off as silly.A cast of soon-to-be-famous (and very young-looking) British actors fill out the rest of the knights, including the likes of Gabriel Byrne, Liam Neeson, Patrick Stewart, and Clive Swift. The costumes are impeccably done, aside from the Morgana gear, and the action sequences have stirring music, including extracts from Carl Orff, to go with them. It's just a shame that the film is so relentlessly downbeat in its tone and goes on for so long, because there is stuff here that's definitely worth your while, making this a very mixed bag indeed.",Excalibur
3,SnoopyStyle,brash bold epic adventure,8,23 August 2015,"It's the Dark Ages and the lands are divided in war. Merlin (Nicol Williamson) retrieves Excalibur from the Lady of the Lake for Lord Uther Pendragon. He secures a short alliance with Duke Gorlois but he lusts after the Duke's wife Igrayne. Merlin disguises Uther as the Duke to have a night with Igrayne in exchange for the resulting child. Uther is ambushed and killed as he drives Excalibur into the stone. Years later, Sir Ector and his sons, Kay and Arthur (Nigel Terry) attend a tournament. When Kay's sword is stolen, Arthur goes and pulls Excalibur from the stone. Ector reveals that Merlin gave Arthur to him as a baby. It splits the kingdom with Leondegrance (Patrick Stewart) willing to support Arthur. Duke Gorlois' daughter Morgana (Helen Mirren) would grow up to scheme against Merlin's plans.It's high fantasy epic adventure. The characters are bigger than life. It's exuberance of unrestrained action. It's wild romance and dastardly treachery. There is no subtlety in the acting. There is no subtlety anywhere in this movie. King Arthur has never been more flawed. His fall is inevitable and tragic.",Excalibur
4,mark.waltz,"Whether fact or fiction, it's still a nice idea.",8,2 August 2016,"Whether it is ""Camelot"", ""The Sword and the Stone"" or Monty Python's ""Holy Grail"" or ""Spamelot"", the stories of King Arthur and his knights, the round table, Guinevere and Lancelot or the search for the holy grail remain all encompassing epics. The same year that a revival of"" Camelot"" appeared on Broadway, an epic non-musical appeared on movie screens. It remains a cult favorite, and now 35 years old, I can see why.Told from the times before King Arthur's conception, this shows Merlin's (Nicol Williamson) influence on the one and future king. It's as sinister as anything in mid-evil history, involving black magic as a fight against good and evil, showing how dark these dark ages really were. Going from young peasant unaware of his destiny to aged king fighting against his own son, Nigel Terry is totally commanding. Helen Mirren is bewitching as the evil Morgan La Fey, given understandable motives for her evils. Cherie Lunghi is tender and sultry as Guenivere. Violent but not excessively bloody, thus fortunately has the spectacle if not the loud noises of modern epics. This Camelot becomes a character itself, gorgeous and flowery when Arthur is in full charge of that spot that for one brief moment was righteous, and drab and lifeless when going through the sinister plotting of Morgan Le Fey and her Caligula like son, Mordred. This is difficult to perfect upon and makes me shake my head at Hollywood for even suggesting that it needs an updating.",Excalibur
5,claudio_carvalho,The Best Version of the Legend of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table ever Made,9,10 February 2019,"""Excalibur"" is the best version of the Legend of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table ever made by the cinema industry. John Boorman´s version has inconsistencies with the legend but it is a perfect blend of fantasy, drama and adventure. Visually stunning, it is worthwhile watching this film in Blu-Ray. The magnificent soundtrack is supported by music of Wagner and Carl Orff. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): ""Excalibur""",Excalibur
6,jboothmillard,Excalibur,6,20 August 2015,"I have seen The Sword in the Stone, Camelot, First Knight, The Magic Sword: Quest for Camelot and King Arthur are just some of the many adaptations I have seen of the famous Arthurian legend, and this was another one I was going to watch, directed by John Boorman (Point Blank, Deliverance, Exorcist II: The Heretic). Basically the sorcerer Merlin (Nicol Williamson) retrieves the mythical sword Excalibur from the Lady of the Lake, he hands it to the violent, powerful knight Uther Pendragon (Gabriel Byrne), but he is mortally wounded during battle, and before his death he plunges the sword into a stone. This legendary sword stays buried in the sword for months to come, Merlin proclaims whoever pulls the sword from the stone will become king of England, many try and fail, it only by chance that Uther's son Arthur (Nigel Terry) happens on the sword. Arthur pulls it out to give to his foster brother Kay (Niall O'Brien) after his original sword is stolen, Arthur is unaware of Excalibur's power, villagers and knights gather on hearing that the sword was pulled, so he hastily returns it, Kay with encouragement from his father Sir Hector (Clive Swift) tries to pull the sword, believing it to be loose now, but fails, so Arthur pulls it out once again, and is declared king of England by Sir Leondegrance (Sir Patrick Stewart). Arthur, guided by wizard Merlin, uses Excalibur to defeat the evil invaders and establish the great court of Camelot and the great Knights of the Round Table, including Sir Lancelot (Nicholas Clay), Sir Perceval (Paul Geoffrey) and Arthur's nephew Sir Gawain (Liam Neeson), he also falls in love with and marries Leondegrance's daughter Guenevere (Cherie Lunghi). In King Arthur's glory years and decline he experiences the shattering of his marriage to Guenevere following her affair with his best friend Sir Lancelot, the quest for the Holy Grail which produces many casualties among the knights, and there is the arrival of Mordred (Robert Addie), the son he had with his evil half-sister, the sorceress Morgana (Dame Helen Mirren). Through all of these events, Merlin watches over everything, always ready to throw in a Charm of Making when it's called for, including ageing Morgana and causing her own sons to kill her, in the end Arthur kills Mordred with Excalibur in a battle, he dies from a mortal wound, the sword is thrown into a pool to be caught by the Lady of the Lake. Also starring Keith Buckley as Uryens, Katrine Boorman, John's daughter as Igrayne, Corin Redgrave as Cornwall, Ciarán Hinds as Lot and Charley Boorman, John's son as Boy Mordred. Terry is a relatively interesting King Arthur, Mirren is good at being the villainess of the piece, but Williamson gets as the best lines and moments as the legendary wizard Merlin, I have to admit when I heard about this film I assumed it was a family film, I could not be more wrong, it had a lot of bloody moments, I also admit I think it should have been a little shorter, but for most of the fight and battles scenes and special effects ladened magic stuff makes it a worthwhile action fantasy. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Cinematography, and it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Costume Design. Good!",Excalibur
7,ccthemovieman-1,"Williamson's Goofy Voice, Poor Beginning Mar Otherwise-Good Film",6,6 March 2007,"Sometimes too much action can get quite boring. One example is the first half of this film, I found this pretty ""slow"" going, even though there is quite a bit of action. However, once the film reaches the halfway point, the story is much better told and winds up very interesting. I found this better to view on the big screen, and I when I saw it at a younger age. This review was from the DVD 20 years after the movie was made. Maybe because the cinematography is the best part of the movie, it was more awesome-looking on the silver screen. This is beautifully filmed.I didn't think the story was that involving only because I didn't the characters were appealing, particularly Nicole Williamson as ""Merlin"" with this incredibly stupid-sounding voice and laugh. What was with that?This movie got by in the '80s with the photography and special effects but today, it's nothing much.",Excalibur
8,rmax304823,Who Was That Lady?,6,14 May 2012,"Well, I'm glad I watched this because I know one or two people who are deep into Arthurian legends and, in order to converse with them at all, I tackled Le Morte D'Arthur and couldn't make heads or tails out of it. Everybody seemed to be fighting everybody else. This movie finally pulled things together for me.Of course I'd heard of many of the characters but I'd always gotten them mixed up or else only knew the names. Now I know where Morgana fits into the picture -- and Merlin, Lancelot, Gawain, and Mordred. I'm still a little confused though. What happened to Galahad? Wasn't he in there somewhere? And what is Percival doing in this story? I thought he had his own story. And if you're going to have Percival -- or Parsifal or whatever his name is -- shouldn't there be a Roland around someplace? That reminds me. A bit of Carmina Burana aside, the musical score is from Richard Wagner and I'm compelled to observe that Wagner stole a hell of a lot from Bernard Herrmann's score for Alfred Hitchcock's ""Vertigo."" Nobody pulls the wool over this boy's eyes. Wagner was not only a racist but a shameless thief.There's a lot of hacking and chopping going on in this movie, both in the mud and out of it. And I guess in all legends the narrative isn't what anyone would call ""taut."" Characters appear and then disappear for rather long periods. And since so many of them wear the same kind of armor it's easy to confuse them. I didn't mind the mystical or magical elements associated with Merlin or Morgana. The Iliad and the Odyssey have Poseidon and Aphrodite and whatnot and they're pretty straight narratives. Well, one of them is, anyway.It's impossible to fault the photography. It's murky without casting a pall over the events. And I liked Excalibur the sword a lot. It glistens with green highlights. I'd like to know which lake Percival threw it in. Maybe it's still there, just waiting for someone like me.The performances are reasonably convincing too. I'm not including the two babies in that observation because they weren't really acting, I don't think. Nicol Williamson is outstanding as a Welsh sorcerer. And it's curious to see the hulking, looming Liam Neeson with his hair combed back over his scalp. He's actually hard to recognize. Of course he's always wearing the same shiny aluminum armor as all the other knights, and that doesn't help.You know, in the end, I still don't know what all the fuss is about when it comes to Arthurian legends. Haven't they turned it into computer games? I can understand watching this movie. It's an enjoyable fantasy. But the myth itself is hardly enthralling.",Excalibur
9,Tweekums,An enjoyable retelling of the myths of King Arthur,7,2 June 2019,"This film tells the story of England's mythical 'Once and Future King'; Arthur Pendragon. It starts when his father, Uther, was king; showing how, with the help of Merlin's sorcery, Arthur was conceived and the kingdom lost. The years pass and the baby becomes a young man. This young man frees the sword from the stone and is declared king. He assembles the Knights of the Round Table, unites the kingdom and marries Guinevere. Now his problems really start; an act of unfaithfulness leads to the loss of those closest to him and then to the conception of his own son; who along with his sorceress mother is destined to be Arthur's greatest enemy.The problem with the story of King Arthur is that most people nowadays probably associate it with the very funny Monty Python film not more serious attempts to bring it to the screen like this. It perhaps doesn't help that even here it is often more than a little bit camp with battles in swirling mists; very shiny armour and some hilariously enunciated dialogue. Thankfully despite these issues I enjoyed this film more than I expected. The acting is fairly mixed; some is distinctly weak but much is pretty solid; including early roles from some now famous actors. The battle scenes are pretty exciting but lack the visceral feel or scale anybody who has watched the likes of 'Game of Thrones' would hope for. The Irish landscapes provide a good setting for the action. Overall I'd say that despite its flaws this film is enjoyable and worth watching.",Excalibur
10,BA_Harrison,Behold! Excali-bore!,4,4 January 2020,"Britain. The Dark Ages. The early 1980s, to be precise. Director John Boorman's Excalibur is unleashed, a lavish historical/fantasy epic largely based on Le Morte D'Arthur, Sir Thomas Malory's 15th Century telling of the Arthurian legend. Boorman throws everything he has at the screen, his film benefitting from stunning set design, creative costumery and impressive cinematography, but uneven direction and terrible performances are its ultimate downfall.Writer Rospo Pallenberg's adaptation includes many of the best-known Arthurian elements, from the drawing of Excalibur from the stone, to Lancelot and Queen Guinevere's adulterous romance, to the quest for the Holy Grail, but Boorman fails to capture the magic of the legend, his film becoming a muddled, long-winded bore that ultimately descends into total confusion (consider that his previous two films were the totally insane sci-fi Zardoz and diabolical horror sequel Exorcist II: The Heretic, and it's not all that surprising).As for the acting, Nicol Williamson is perhaps the biggest offender, his head-scratching turn as Merlin making one wonder whether he was dared by his mates to go through the whole film making inappropriate pauses and extending every vowel. Not quite as bad, but hardly the stuff of legend, is Nigel Terry as King Arthur: he lacks the gravitas for such a role, and comes across as bit of a wimp. Future A-listers Liam Neeson, Patrick Stewart and Helen Mirren also fail to make an impression, and nepotism is alive and well, John Boorman casting his children Charley and Katrine in the roles of young Mordred and Igrayne.The film does, however, provide a few unintentional laughs, some bits almost as silly as Monty Python's 1975 take on the story: try keeping a straight face as Arthur opts to keep his armour on while having sex (imagine the clanking!), or when necromancer Morgana (Mirren) uses her dark arts to protect her son: nothing says 'ancient magical power' more than a couple of handfuls of gold glitter thrown in the air!3.5/10, rounded up to 4 for the sometimes stunning visuals, and the occasional spot of nudity and graphic gore, which help to make matters a little more bearable.",Excalibur
11,moonspinner55,"Has visual interest, but Boorman doesn't have a very strong grip on this story...",4,12 June 2005,"Overrated Dark Ages tale of King Arthur and the legend of Camelot, given surreal, dream-like treatment by director John Boorman--but no introduction to the characters and no dramatic tension to the story. Parts of the film come to life, but I wouldn't necessarily call it magical: all the characters talk and sound alike, and the final bloody battle sequence (filled with thick fog) is a cinematographer's nightmare. Nicol Williamson is great fun as Merlin the Magician, Helen Mirren outstanding as the wicked Morgana, but most of the other performances fall short. Even Williamson has trouble emoting over the noisy din, and Boorman's fragmented handling never gives the audience a chance to really relish the actor's comic mastery. ** from ****",Excalibur
12,Quinoa1984,"the classic story told without any hint of parody or cynicism: a bloody, brutal tale for all times",9,19 May 2010,"It's hard to watch the story of Excalibur at certain points without recollecting Monty Pytyhon and the Holy Grail. This is not John Boorman's fault any more than it was Robert Bresson's when he made Lancelot of the Lake (both of which take the Arthurian legend and tell it with a straight face and upstanding production value). I chuckle at seeing Camelot (and it IS a model indeed), and when Arthur has to face off against Lancelot. But Boorman is so good a director as to still take me out of satire and into the real bloody guts and thrills and drama (or really fantastical melodrama) of this story.Excalibur does start a little shaky on some silly ground, or just a little like ""huh, really?"" This comes early when Merlin sets to task the impressionable and fiery Uther Pendragon to have his 'love' with the maiden, and has him cross the 'dragon's breath' (which is just fog) on his horse to ride over to her and so Merlin can do 'his thing' to which he'll have to recover in nine moons. Immediately I started to think ""yes, this is well-directed, but I can't shake off the connection that the same man made the inexplicable Zardoz."" And here and there Boorman goes into such strange and macabre territory that is a little bonkers; sometimes this works well, such as when Morgana puts into effect her plan to have her son with her brother, King Arthur, and it's done in such a way that is chilling and dark and evil, and just right.But once Boorman gets into the Arthur legend, of pulling the sword from the stone and becoming knighted by another who looked under him, and then met Lancelot and Guinnevere and had his ups and downs with Merlin and so on, it becomes more and more satisfying. The actors are well-suited for such material: Nigel Terry as Arthur and Nicholas Clay as Lancelot have very direct, two-dimensional characters and they play them as if they were the superheroes of their time, conflicted, troubled, and just a little uneasy in the Dark Ages, but willing to do what it takes when the time comes. And other actors, like Helen Mirren, just eat up the scenery in a delicious kind of way (she doesn't quite start like that, but in the last act as she's the villainess she really is something).Best of all though is Merlin. Whenever Nicol Williamson comes on the screen the film comes alive in a manner that is hard to describe. He just knows how to add the right inflections in the speech, get the right walk and the distinctive stare at Arthur or Morgana, and while his character starts off questionably (taking Arthur from his mother so soon after birth, you say), he makes his character believable and awesome every step of the way. Hell, he even looks the bad-ass when surrounded in a block of ice! All of this benefits Boorman as he takes his story to some epic heights. Very little of it, in fact, is dated because when visual effects or models are implemented they aren't the kind that stick out. Today an Excalibur would be filled with CGI, perhaps even for the metallic clang of the swords. Here, everything is costumes and real forests, castles and armor, body parts flying and blood spilling generously in those battle scenes (or just in any given scene there's some violence).Like Bresson with his 1974 film, Boorman is an iconoclast with his images. He wants things to stick in the viewer's mind long after they end (for me one of those in this case is the scene where Perceval is hanging from the tree and is near death but dreams of something crazy as he's being accidentally cut down). But where Bresson meant for his Arthur to be seen in a more subdued manner with his typical withdrawn non-professional actors, Excalbur is meant as popular entertainment for the masses. This is something that could conceivably be a family film, albeit the generous bloodletting and the occasional gratuitous female nudity. Excalibur takes its source seriously enough to make it work, and without it slipping at least too far into its own parody. Some lines, to be sure, may be delivered very over-the-top, and a particular moment with Morgana near the end is kind of laughable in a sick way. But in general, this is astonishing work of a professional variety. It gets the adrenaline moving when it needs to, and settles an audience in for those ""talky"" scenes just right.",Excalibur
13,JohnHowardReid,Disappointing!,6,24 February 2013,"I missed this film on first release. It had a disastrous city season at the largest cinema in town (it ran only one or two weeks) and then totally vanished. So I was very pleased to pick up the excellent Warner Brothers DVD. The movie itself, however, proved to be a vast disappointment. Writer/director John Boorman has gone overboard for gloom in this one. From first to last, the mood is decidedly dark. There is no shading at all. Rather than being captivated by King Arthur and his retinue, we are if anything repulsed. This is not the Arthur of legend and storybook, but a weak and totally uncharismatic figure who couldn't lead a duck to water, let alone sort out the one or two rights and the thousand and eleven wrongs of the Round Table. Of the large number of featured players, only Nicol Williamson's Merlin makes any impression – and that's not due to his personal charisma, but merely to the fact that he's in almost every scene! And I'll admit that Alex Thomson's award-winning photography masterfully conveys an overwhelming feeling of loss, gloom and despair.",Excalibur
14,BandSAboutMovies,A great film,7,3 June 2021,"Shot entirely on location in Ireland, employing mostly Irish actors and crew, Excalibur was an important film for the Irish filmmaking industry and helped start the careers of Liam Neeson, Patrick Stewart, Gabriel Byrne and Ciarán Hinds.It was also known as the Boorman Family Project, as several members of director Jonathan Boorman's family appear, with his daughter Katrine Boorman playing Igrayne - Arthur's mother - as well as his daughter Telsche as the Lady of the Lake and his son Charley acting in the role of Mordred as a boy. It was shot a mile from his home, so he was able to be at home for the entire making of the movie.Boorman has been wanting to make the movie since 1969, yet the three-hour script was seen as too costly by United Artists and instead, he was offered The Lord of the Rings, which he did not make yet did develop. He ended up using some of the work that went into that adaption here, as well as potentially being inspired by Monty Python and the Holy Grail.He'd worked with Rospo Pallenberg on that canceled film (as well as Exorcist II: The Heretic and The Emerald Forest; Pallenberg would also direct Cutting Class), so he worked with him here to bring Malory's Morte d'Arthur to theaters. Boorman said that his film was about ""the coming of Christian man and the disappearance of the old religions which are represented by Merlin. The forces of superstition and magic are swallowed up into the unconscious.""I love Roger Ebert's review of this movie, in which he said that the film was both a wondrous vision and a mess, ""a record of the comings and goings of arbitrary, inconsistent, shadowy figures who are not heroes but simply giants run amok. Still, it's wonderful to look at.""It's beyond gorgeous, actually, a movie that combines shocking gore with artistic flourishes, like the three ladies in white who attend Arthur to Avalon at the close. Boorman was also smart enough to cast Nicol Williamson as Merlin and Helen Mirren as Morgana Le Fay, two actors who had had a conflict when they acted in Macbeth together. He felt that tension would be seen on screen and it certainly is. That said, Mirren claimed that the two become friends while making Excalibur.It rained every single day of the shoot, which adds to the foggy look of the film. It had many issues, as the first fight scene had to be filmed three times. It was filmed at night and the exposure meter was broken, leading to two different scenes of underexposed film.Boorman's career is pretty great. Sure, there are the big movies like Deliverance, but I love that he shoots for the fences and makes off the wall stuff like Zardoz and Exorcist II: The Heretic. Here's to less playing it safe for directors, even if the misses end up being spectacular losses. I don't think that that can happen any longer in entertainment.",Excalibur
15,Scarecrow-88,Excaliber,8,30 November 2006,"I give director John Boorman a ton of credit for what he tries(..and, for the most part, accomplishes)to do with this film based on the life of King Arthur which opens with how he was conceived through the deception of his father using Merlin's magic, how he removed the Excaliber sword from the stone his dying father placed there, to his rise as King, to his first meeting(and swordplay)with Sir Lancelot, to his wife Guenevere's adulterous betrayal with Lancelot, to the rise of his evil half-sister Morgana(..and her deceit of Arthur in an incestuous mind-trick bearing a son)and how she will grow her son to hate him, and ultimately the search for the Holy Grail to lift a curse plaguing Arthur.All this is given a go as Boorman tries with all his might to bring a faithful and beautiful work from the Arthurian legend. The film moves relatively at a quicker pace than most epics despite it being over two hours through some cunning editing. He includes all the important elements which makes the life of Arthur so rich, but when you want to make such a feat on an epic scale, things are going to be left out. How can anyone include everything and not make an 8-hour mini-series. He has to bring us a film that aspires to bring awe..and he does. The film is so wondrous to behold with stunning story-telling as we see those who are important factors in the shaping of Arthur and how he will represent his land and people. The acting might be seen as a bit over-the-top in a theatrical sort of way, but it doesn't sway from the visual feast and sumptuous splendor Boorman brings us. The film includes adult themes within showing nakedness and bloody violence by staying true to the source. The film also has some breathtaking cinematography and the attention to period detail and a quickened pace makes this film entertaining without the lulls a period film could often suffer from.",Excalibur
16,LeonLouisRicci,Shiny But Somewhat Stilted,6,24 January 2013,"The beauty of this film is showcased and showcased some more. It is a lavish production with gleams of light reflecting off gleams of light. Everything shines and the colors are softly muted by the dense and damp surroundings. This is a shining example of a sublime surrounding inhabited by some really unimpressive Mythical icons.The worst part of the film is the flesh and blood participants. There is overacting and some of the worst voice sound recordings that feel like post production studio dubbing. The actors all seem to be trying to burst out of their confined armor with voice exclamations and theater emotes.The female participants fare much better and are beautifully attired and soft peddle their lines and are much more comfortable in their wardrobes. The male cast not so much. The Arthur and Merlin characters come from the Monty Python mode of straight faced farce and are simply just not believable. Both seem like they are miscast and mishandled.The film is wonderful to look at and has enough splendor to keep things moving along as the dialog and acting is forever pulling things to a stop, but fortunately things keep trotting along and some of it is breathtaking to behold. There is however, just too much going against this spectacle to be completely satisfying and ultimately is rendered impotent by hammy thespians and confusing exposition.",Excalibur

18,view_and_review,1981 Wasn't the Right Time,5,3 December 2019,"I suppose it would have been of great benefit to have been more familiar with the King Arthur story. Honestly, I only know of some key names and the sword in the stone, beyond that I don't know anything.Being that that is the case, I found myself hopelessly lost at times. The movie zoomed through the ages briefly stopping at key moments. Some of those stops were too brief to even feign a guess as to what was happening and why. Of course, today this movie would've been made into a trilogy. Maybe it was just made at the wrong time.Excalibur rambled through its different acts with some gross overacting that may have been fit for a Shakespeare play but not a movie. In fact, a long theatrical play is what it was. From the actors to the set it all resembled a theatrical play. This epic tale didn't make it as an epic movie.",Excalibur
19,neil-476,Fascinating and gripping,8,1 April 2011,"Excalibur is like no other film about the Arthurian legend. It makes a concerted attempt to present every aspect of that legend - even the magical and mythic parts of it - as if they were not so much factual as real life. In the same way that Star Wars gave science fiction a veneer of real life dirt and grime, wear and tear, so Excalibur presented the sword in the stone, the lady in the lake and so on, as if one could see such things in their awful magnificence simply by walking to the end of the road, where one would find the beautiful mythic woods one sees in the film.This is a remarkable looking film, and visually does its subject proud. Casting and performances are all good, although Nicol Williamson's Merlin affects a most peculiar accent - a kind of mixture between Gaelic, comedy Jew, and Spike Milligan. The storytelling is occasionally a little too leisurely, and personally I felt that the Grail quest was not a necessary part of the story and could usefully have been omitted.But if you've never seen it, this is definitely one to catch. You won't ever see anything else like it.",Excalibur
20,AlsExGal,I think people are just a little too hard on Morgana...,7,12 June 2016,"... after all she witnesses what amounts to the rape of her own mother, and then sees the product of that rape inherit a kingdom (Nigel Terry as Arthur Pendragon). Of course she wants revenge, and justice in the most ironic way for what happened to her mother. Let me explain.Uther Pendragon has peace, has his throne, has a truce with the duke of Cornwall. At a dinner celebrating the truce, Cornwall shows off his beautiful wife, Igrayne. Uther ruins the truce in an unspeakable breach of etiquette by going for Igrayne right there in front of everybody. Hostilities rebegin. Uther begs Merlin to let him have Igrayne by the spell of making so that he looks like her husband, Cornwall. Apparently it was the custom for husbands and wives to have sex in front of their toddler children, and furthermore Uther does not even bother to take his armor off during the act! That's what I mean by rape - Igrayne is being duped into having sex with Uther Pendragon. Morgana, Cornwall and Igrayne's child, looks on, sees through the spell of making, and also envisions her father dying on the battlefield throughout her mother's rape. This is something she never forgets.With Cornwall dead, Uther takes Igrayne for his own, and nine months later she gives birth to a child - Uther's from the rape. But, alas, Uther promised to give Merlin anything that came from his deception, so he must turn over the child, Arthur Pendragon, to Merlin. Uther decides a deal is not a deal, and pursues Merlin and the child, only to be killed by Cornwall's vengeful troops who are still hanging about. Merlin thrusts Excalibur into a stone and proclaims whoever shall draw the sword from the stone will be king. Why do the people keep listening to this guy? I guess the fact that he could turn anybody into a toad is part of it.Time passes, Arthur grows up looking and acting like nobody special (Nigel Terry), and is assisting Kay, a knight in a tournament whose sword is stolen. Arthur just sees the sword in the stone, does not know its significance, and just pulls it out to give to Kay. Merlin announces that Arthur has accidentally pulled Excalibur from the stone and he is king.Well it turns out that more than just the communist peasants in Monty Python's Holy Grail believe that pulling a sword from a stone is not the basis for an acceptable form of government, and Arthur has to work to solidify his kingdom. In the process, he marries Guenevere, daughter of one of his allies, and convinces Lancelot to join him. But Lancelot and Guenevere fall for one another, finally giving in to their feelings. When Arthur comes upon their post coital slumber he plunges Excalibur into the ground and wanders off broken.Now all of this time Morgana (Helen Mirren) is still bitter about her mother's rape and the product of that rape, Arthur, getting a throne because of her mother being deceived. She tricks Merlin into revealing the spell of making, traps him in a crystal, and then decides turnabout is fair play. She makes herself appear as Guenevere, causing Arthur to think his queen has returned to him, and he sleeps with her, conceiving an incestuous child. This child grows to manhood and challenges Arthur for his throne, which is easier than it would normally be because Arthur would have to kill his own son/nephew, plus the land has become barren and the people are starving because nothing grows from the ground, blaming the king. So how does all of this turn out? Watch and find out. This film is very atmospheric. Nicol Williamson steals the show as Merlin with his odd glances and one liners and looking very ""unmagician"" like at times. If he hadn't played a complete tool in ""I'm Dancing as Fast as I Can"" a year later, I might still like seeing him in this role.So what have we learned here today? Crime does not pay, the career options are not good for queens who commit adultery, and bitter half siblings can really mess up your life if you give them the chance. Recommended.",Excalibur
21,morrison-dylan-fan,Lifted from the river.,7,19 August 2012,"Being given a wonderful intro to the ""Camelot"" tale by a friend who kindly gave me the 1967 film version,and also helped me to find a pretty rare filmed version of the stage production,I was pleasantly surprised,when I recently received a surprise parcel from them,which along with containing Hammer studio's fun Sci-Fi Western Moon Zero Two,also contained John Boorman's 1981 take on the ""Camelot"" tale.Finding it almost impossible to resist another visit,I excitingly got prepared to once again enter King Arthur's court.The plot:Having helped Uther Pendragon to get what he has most desired, (Igraine-the wife of the Gorlois:The Duke of Cornwall) Merlin decides that it is time for him to collect what is owed to him for helping build the relationship:Pendragon and Igraine's son:Arthur.Trying to stop Merlin from taking his son,Pandragon gets caught in an ambush by some of Gorlois's knight.Having mere moments to live,Pendragon slams his faithful sword Excalibur into a rock,so that it can only be pulled out by the person whose future is destined to be king.Decades later:Attempting to find a replacement sword for his brother Kay, (whose sword has been stolen) Arthur stumbles upon a sword in a stone.Soon being surrounded by dozens of people,Arthur is told by his ""father"" Sir Ector that he is in fact not his son,but is really the son of Pendragon,who is destined to be the new king.Being officially declared as a knight and as a new king after helping to settle a huge on going battle,Arthur becomes smitten with a woman called Guinevere,who he decides will be his wife.A few years later:With being happily married and having his trusted aid Merlin by his side,the now King Arthur decides to build a Round Table for the residents of Camelot,so that all their voices can truly be heard.As the building of the Round Table nears its completion, King Arthur meets a knight called Sir Lancelot,who holds many of the same ideas which Arthur does.Being given a seat as one of the trusted knights of the Round Table,Arthur's wife: Guinevere and Lancelot soon start to ""secretly"" lust for one another,which leads Merlin to begin fearing that the relationship between Guinevere and Lancelot could destroy everything which Arthur and the other knights have done for the people of Camelot.View on the film:Filming all of the on-location scenes in Ireland,director John Boorman, (who also produced and co-wrote the film with Rospo Pallenberg) and cinematography Alex Thomson give the movie a tremendously lush ""wet"" green appearance,with the long,well exactitude tracking shots allowing Boorman and Thomson to fully show the woodland location as a fresh land with the grass and tress looking like they have been covered in light rain.Contrasting the ""fresh"" on location scenes,Boorman goes for a chilling,almost Gothic Horror style for the ""moments of darkness"" scenes in Excalibur,from Igraine having dragon like smoke come out of her nose,to the mysterious Lady of The Lake's arm coming from out of a river to try and help Excalibur to shine.Despite the very best efforts from the fantastic cast, (with two of the best performances being Nicol Williamson as a slightly mean spirited Merlin and Nigel Terry as the inspirational,but flawed King Arthur) Boorman's great stylised directing is sadly not able to over come the flawed elements of the screenplay.Appearing to have one eye on the Camelot tale and one eye on making the film pretty explicit, (such as having nudity and a slightly ott focus on the gore, in the otherwise good battle scenes) Boorman and Pallenberg are sadly not able to fully build the characters and the decades spanning plot into something with a real,deep emotional thread.As the optimistic rise and gut wrenching fall of Camelot is shown,Boorman and Pallenberg disappointingly make each ""decade"" section end rather abruptly,which whilst allowing for an outline of the character to be made,does not give the chance for the characters to be given the depth which would turn them into mythological legends.",Excalibur
22,AaronCapenBanner,Sword Of Britain,9,1 December 2013,"John Boorman directed this stylish filming of the legend of King Arthur and his knights of the round table. Film starts with Merlin(played by Nicol Williamson) giving King Uther Pendragon the mythical sword Excalibur, which, upon his death, he buries in a stone and proclaims that the man who can pull it out will be the next king. Many men try, but only one, Arthur(played by Nigel Terry) succeeds, and after a battle, is proclaimed by all king. Merlin is by his side, but Arthur's evil half-sister Morgana(played by Helen Mirren) plots against him, using her son to lead a revolt, as Arthur's peaceful kingdom is threatened, though the search for the Holy Grail offers some hope. Exemplary film is first-rate all the way, with brilliant direction and stirring score; a most imaginative and visually stunning film that stays with the viewer, with a most fitting(and moving) ending.",Excalibur
23,Wuchakk,Eccentric depiction of the medieval myths surrounding King Arthur,6,25 November 2018,"In the late 400s Merlin the sorcerer of Britain takes advantage of the lust of King Uther (Gabriel Byrne) for a Duke's wife, Ingrayne (Katrine Boorman), to grant him a boy who becomes King Arthur of Camelot (Nigel Terry) when he pulls Excalibur from the stone, a magical sword. Arthur marries Guenevere (Cherie Lunghi), but when Lancelot (Nicholas Clay) joins the Knights of the Round Table the two experience a profound affinity for each other. Meanwhile, Arthur's half-sister, Morgana (Helen Mirren) is intent on incestuous deception to produce a son, Mordred.The script to this acclaimed 1981 film by John Boorman was adapted from Sir Thomas Malory's ""Le Morte d'Arthur"" (""The Death of Arthur""), published in 1485. The Arthurian folklores are used as an allegory of the succession of birth, life, decline, and renewal. The resulting film is reminiscent of works of mythography and is therefore episodic in nature. For instance, the sequence where the concept of the Round Table is established comes and goes in an awkward way. Another example is at the 95-minute mark where the story switches to the Knights' search for the Holy Grail, which focuses on a heretofore unknown knight.Needless to say, the story's not consistently compelling because the movie's too segmented. The middle part detailing the romance between Guenevere and Lancelot, and the ramifications thereof, is the best part as far as that goes. The first half hour is a little convoluted, story-wise, and I suggest using the subtitles to discern accented dialogue and to keep track of the odd names. The search for the Holy Grail in the last 45 minutes breaks the film's momentum because it feels tacked on.Nevertheless, if you can roll with the hammy acting, the melodrama and the episodic framework, there are a lot of positives to enjoy. Some good examples include: the beautiful sylvan locations, the fairy tale-like castles & sets, the imaginative costumes (e.g. the armor), the lovely ladies and the lush colors. Also, the soundtrack/score, which greatly utilizes ""O Fortuna"" by Carl Orff and a few pieces by Richard Wagner, is notable. Meanwhile, watch out for a young Liam Neeson as the knight Gawain.The big flaw here is that the story lacks steady thrust. For that, check out the more reality-oriented ""First Knight"" (1995) and ""King Arthur"" (2004).The film runs 2 hours, 20 minutes and was shot entirely in Ireland.GRADE: B-/C+",Excalibur
24,Sylviastel,An Entertaining Delight!,8,5 November 2014,"Dame Helen Mirren gives a delightful performance as Morgana in this version of Merlin and Excalibur. With magic and mysticism, this film is entertaining but confusing at times. Nicol Williamson was a brilliant talented Shakespearan actor who should better remembered for his Hamlet and Macbeth than Merlin. His scenes with Mirren have a history of their own since they were lovers before filming. Mirren giving birth to Mordred reminds me of in Caligula. Mordred was born for revenge out of an incestuous encounter between siblings. Still the film has an all star cast but the film belongs to Mirren who plays Morgana with such wickedness that you want to root for her anyway. Williamson's Merlin is sorely needs a better costume and better dialog.",Excalibur
25,mm-39,One of the better versions of King Author!,7,15 October 2021,"I have over the years have seen so many versions of King Author, but Excalibur is so far the best. What works is the British cast creates a feel of realism of a British story. There is a few notable names before the actors became famous in Excalibur. Excalibur's script has all the ingredients of mystery, betrayal, action, and romance which blend together for a good story. The viewer is left with always wanting more as the sub stories unfold. The director and editors give away just enough to build up a simmering tension as Excalibur builds into the story of the search for the Holy Grail. A memorable ending which ties up a great story done by a great movie. 7 stars.",Excalibur
26,lasttimeisaw,Excalibur,7,14 September 2012,"England-born, Ireland-residing director John Boorman's THE LORD OF THE RINGS wannabe in the 80s has an epic contour and piquant visual stunts, fusing the legend of THE SWORD IN THE STONE (1963, 8/10) and KING ARTHUR (2004, 5/10), together shaping a thorough and staggering chronicle recount on the mythology with an intoxicating ancient Greek tragedy pathos. The film has its mark of its time since the CGI scenes are revealing its real age, but the overall ramifications (after a 144 minutes running time) are not laughable at all, Boorman's kitschy yet strenuously made settings (a golden and silver Camelot could never be more shining using the aluminum materials and lightning enhancement) and many superimposed special effects are effectually utilized, plus the right-place-right-moment playing of Carl Orff's CARMINA BURANA also insists in honing up the tragic atmosphere into the extremity. The actors are much better and more confident in delivering lines than in overshooting their clumsy battlefield slashes, from a fiery beginning combat until the final foggy father-son slaughter, all the action scenes are designed to not be taken seriously, however miraculously it doesn't nullify a sacred seriousness running in the pulse of the film, and what makes the film more than bearable is the uppermost devotion from the cast, an indeed fluctuating assemblage, Nigel Terry is steadily embodying himself with the true kingship as King Arthur, a late bloomer in the film since it looks like he is a tad gauche in playing a young Arthur. Helen Mirren's adult Morgana is viperous, phenomenal and Shakespearean while Nicol Williamson's Merlin has a fervent surge of passion and allure in enchanting his audience (both in and out of the film). By comparison, Nicolas Clay's Lancelot, Cherie Lunghi's Guenevere and Paul Geoffrey's Perceval are just too perfect in their molding as the straightforward good people, their struggles mostly fall flat. Also this is the film debut of Gabriel Byrne, Liam Neeson, Ciarán Hinds and Cherie Lunghi, it could be another reason for cinephiles to revisit this cult version of the dark age. For Boorman, my only preceding experience with his work is THE TAILOR OF PANAMA (2001, 5/10), then arguably Excalibur might be the summit of his career, a 7 out of 10 may do some justice to him.",Excalibur

The movie had an over all dark but dreamy look and feel about it which is hypnotic.

28,ThomasDrufke,The Dark Ages,8,9 May 2017,"Excalibur is probably the King Arthur film that most ambitiously tackles the in-depth mythology and legend of the medieval warrior, which is both a good and bad thing.Let's start with the good. This film is a fascinating dive into the ins and outs of Arthurian Legend, starting with the mystical sword, Excalibur. Sometimes the most interesting way to tell a story isn't through your characters but a representation of their strengths and weaknesses. Excalibur is just that for Arthur. He relies on the sword for strength and wisdom, which in turn is his weakness. The power the sword yields him is bigger than Arthur himself, which is where he can sometimes fall victim to the temptations of greed and self-value. At the same time, the sword is easily the films coolest asset.For the first hour or so, it gets increasingly harder to root for Arthur as a character. Here's a guy who stumbles upon power and acts like he's worked his whole life to get it, and he's hardly humble about his circumstances. It isn't until we realize where the story is going and who the main antagonist is that our protagonist (being Arthur) really hits the right note. All of a sudden, a whiny and largely unworthy King, feels noble and brave through the faults of the villain. It is then that the film takes off to an exciting, but equally strange place.This version of the King Arthur story isn't afraid of embracing the fantasy elements and downright weirdness of the source material. Not only do you have Merlin, the great wizard, manipulating certain situations in the background, but you have plenty of other mystical elements enhanced to fit the story that director John Boorman was trying to tell. With that said, when the film does tackle the mystical side of the story it doesn't always feel in place with the rest of the grounded war film that's in its place. So in that regard, I have mixed feelings on it.However, in all, this is about as good as you can tell the proper Arthurian story. It has everything from a brilliant focus on the sword, Lancelot's jealousy and betrayal, a twisted backstory, Merlin pulling the strings, bloody battles, to an overall epic journey for the King. If there was a film that epitomizes all that is good (and strange) about the mythology, Excalibur is probably it.+Crazy mythology embraced+Epic+Performances+Even dives into the strangeness-Which is where it sometimes takes the film off the rails8.3/10",Excalibur
29,ericstevenson,Longest one ever,8,5 February 2017,"Well, this is, as far as I know, the longest movie ever made based on Arthurian legend. Looking at the back of the box, I realize that it's based on a book called ""Le Morte Darthur"". I had no idea that Arthurian legend was contained in a single book or at least not as much of it in a book. I guess I'm not that familiar with the legends, but from what I did know, it was interesting to see it all come alive in this movie! Yes, this had everything I knew about King Arthur including the sword and the stone, the round table, Merlin, Morgan le Fey, and Mordred. I got everything I knew about them.The costumes and lighting effects were brilliant in this movie! For a movie named after the weapon, it wasn't entirely about it. Instead, we got everything we know from the classic stories. There wasn't much of an attempt to be elaborate or anything. I especially like Mordred's armor. I guess in that sense, it wasn't really that unique. It didn't offer anything that new to the story, but it didn't need to. It's simply a very fine looking film that holds up. I remember a time when 1981 wasn't that long ago. I loved Patrick Stewart too. ***",Excalibur
30,A_Different_Drummer,"35 years later, still the most visceral",9,3 April 2014,"The story? The cast? What makes this film the most dramatic and memorable of all the Arthurian re-tellings, even though it is three and a half decades old, and was done at a time when CGI was in its infancy? Mainly (with one exception, explained below) its Boorman, clearly one of the greatest and most passionate directors of his era, his films pop off the screen into the cortex of the viewer. Each scene is framed with passion. The early part of the story where magic is used to fool the wife of the elder Pendragon into believing that her husband has returned ""early"" is possibly one of the spookiest and yet most engaging scenes of its kind. It haunts you for years after. And the second factor to consider is Nicol Williamson, himself one of the most charismatic and intense actors of his era. His Merlin is equally iconic, unforgettable, driven, and the portrait of a man trapped within his own destiny. Even his accent (an odd mix I cannot clearly define) makes each sentence he utters that much more profound. An astonishing film, equal parts myth, action, fantasy, romance and also a strange creepy horror which no film since has captured or emulated.",Excalibur
31,CuriosityKilledShawn,"Weird, rather than magical",6,11 September 2004,"Back in the day, John Boorman wanted to make a live-action version of the Lord of the Rings but could not get the rights. Instead he made a similar movie and with a lot more seriousness than any incarnation before or after it. Excalibur is filled with sex, violence, incest and nudity. Trouble is none of it seems magical. Yes, Merlin is in there (played by Nicol Williamson) but he's more of a wild eccentric than the Dumbledore figure he more widely known as. He does magic, but most of it is not important to the plot.Uther Pendragon is played with viciousness by Gabriel Byrne, looking a bit harder than I'm used to and Helen Mirren pops up as Morgana, which was a bit of sly casting on John Boorman's part as Mirren and Williamson hated each other. My main problem is the guy who plays Arthur. He just doesn't look right, or noble or brave. I suppose this was supposed to be a contrast between him and the dashingness of Sir Lancelot but he does look a bit too much like Lenny from The Simpsons. Liam Neeson also has a smaller role as one of Arthur's knights as does Patrick Stewart (with hair!) as Leondegras.In the end it does follow the same old story with the same old ending but the journey is different and more adult. Though it still puzzles me why the Knights of the Round Table show up for their meetings wearing full armor and appear to search for the Holy Grail in Britain when they should be searching in somewhere like Israel. Unlike his score to Merlin in 1998, Trevor's Jones' score to Excalibur is serious and sparse. There's not much going on other than rumblings and the occasional blast on brass. Meh! It works, but not as magical as his later fantasy work in The Dark Crystal and Merlin. The DVD is 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen with Dolby 5.1 sound. The R2 DVD features a better cover art and also comes in a sturdy keepcase than a crappy old snapper. Pick up cheap or wait for a Special Edition.",Excalibur
32,Bored_Dragon,Unique in good and bad way simultaneously,7,14 November 2017,"Movie that succeeds to be at the same time bad movie and the best adaptation of legend of King Arthur and Knights of the Round Table. For 1981. it's visually fascinating and deserves Best Cinematography Oscar it's nominated for. But however magical and hypnotizing it may be, it's also full of flaws. It's poorly written, story is undeveloped, things just happen without explanation and movie makes rough time jumps without transition. Characters are two-dimensional and occasional attempts to add them some depth are tragicomic. With few exceptions, acting is better left uncommented. When I was a child I was stunned with this movie, but from current perspective, changed by few decades of movie experience, this movie is so hollow that I simply can not turn the blind eye to all its flaws, but still so beautiful that I can not rate it low either.7/10",Excalibur
33,sol-,My brief review of the film,8,30 September 2005,"Magnificently photographed, with superb sets and costumes too, this is great stuff on a visual scope, even if it is otherwise a bit messy. Some sections are somewhat rushed and ill explained, and there is not much room for characterisation amid all the action. Still, there are quite a number of exciting bits, even if the characters are hard to distinguish from one another and the individual actions sequences are not well developed. On the negative side, the fog effects are overbearing too, and there is close to no sense of time. There seems to be a lot of bad points to draw on when discussing this film, but there are plenty of virtues too, thanks to it being made on an appropriate budget and the director knowing how to make his project look interesting. It may only be gripping now and again, but the overall effective of the experience of watching this film is quite good. Suffice it to say, it is amusing stuff if one does not feel the need to look too deeply at it, but be warned... it has confronting sexual elements, so it is not for the kids.",Excalibur
34,didi-5,Morte d'Arthur as movie,9,16 April 2004,"This film is a superb and gory telling of the legend of King Arthur, his Round Table, and the betrayal of his wife Guinevere with Lancelot du Lac. This version, directed by the capable and imaginative John Boorman, starts with the conception of Arthur  his father, King Uther Pendragon, copulates with the mother of Morgana while in magical disguise as her husband, who lies dead nearby.  After Pendragon is slain, a bargain is made between the mother-to-be and sorcerer Merlin that he will be given the ensuing child to rear.This takes care of how Arthur came to be brought up under the mystical guise of Camelot  he later grows to be king and meets the mysterious Guinevere during a castle battle.  Despite her love for him, and Lancelot's respect for his king, the two lovers become embroiled in a union destructive to all. The return of the poisonous Morgana with Arthur's son, Mordred, is the final blow.What I loved particularly about Excalibur' was the way the stunning cinematography was teamed with musical interludes (O Fortuna, from Carmina Burana, in particular).  The performances are excellent  Nigel Terry as a world-weary Arthur; Cherie Lunghi as Guinevere; Nicholas Clay as Lancelot; Nicol Williamson as a quaintly comic Merlin; Helen Mirren as the witch Morgana; and Gabriel Byrne as the doomed Pendragon.The film is certainly violent and doesn't flinch from the more unpleasant aspects of the Arthur legend, but the result is a genuinely involving experience and one of the best films to come out of the 1980s.",Excalibur

Better even than Roman Polanski's gritty, sometimes too realistic version of MACBETH (take a nice, long look at those three witches), Excalibur, in a relatively short running time, tells an Epic Tale in an Epic Fashion. While it would be understandable if Boorman had opted to leave out some of the many details that comprise this particular tale, he doesn't (at least, not that I'm aware).

I was sixteen years old at the time and there are scenes of this movie I have never forgotten. I own a poster of this movie. But as much of a fan of ""Excalibur"" that I am, there's still a lot of it that doesn't sit well with me. The biggest problem is Nigel Terry. The role of King Arthur is just too much for him. He wasn't up for the task. He actually is pretty annoying most of the time. The rest of the cast is very strong. The movie's pace drags sometimes.

39,funkyfry,Boorman's fantasy masterpiece,9,1 March 2009,"A lot of the sci-fi and fantasy films that we fans used to treasure back in the 70s and 80s really have not been ""aging"" well. Their excessive effects sequences no longer dazzle one with wonder, their contemporary music jars with the time period depicted, or they simply feel overall too tied into the ethos and style of that particular time. John Boorman's ""Excalibur"" falls prey to none of these weaknesses. When I picked it up on DVD to watch it just recently, I was afraid that my memory of the film would be more rosy than the film itself. Actually quite the opposite -- it is a better film than I would have been equipped to realize back in my childhood days when I appreciated mostly the style and the violence of the film.The scope of the story is very ambitious. Taking in various elements from T.H. White's ""Once and Future King"" and Thomas Mallory's ""Death of Arthur"" as well as Tolkien's ""Lord of the Rings"" (more on that below), Boorman and his writing partner Rospo Pallenberg manage to take in pretty much the entire story at least in its broadest outlines (and minus the side story of Tristan). Ever since the French first got hold of this story, most re-tellings (including Mallory's) have focused quite a bit on the romantic element of the story at the expense of its larger mythic structure. Boorman and Pallenberg resolve this problem fairly well by weaving the romance into the mythology -- for instance the striking scene they invented with Launcelot fighting himself in a nightmare. Boorman's attention to detail is impressive -- CGI that is used for modern films could not create the kind of otherworldly beauty that we see in the wedding scene here, for instance -- but what's most impressive is the presence of the overall story and myth arc in every individual scene in the film.Also Boorman avoids showy effects and only uses some minor effects when they are necessary for the story. The whole transformation of Uther Pendragon, for example, is just shown through a fog and then an edit, where many film-makers would have wanted to show some kind of effect for the transformation that would draw attention to itself and look poor today. Since Boorman avoids composite effects like rear projection, stop motion, etc. (and since CGI composite was not yet invented), there are basically no ""outdated"" effects to be seen in the entire film. Boorman instead supplies wonderful scenery and asks the audience to use its imagination for a lot of the magic that he simply conjures with a smoke machine.The weakness of this film, arguably, is in some of the lead performances. Nigel Terry is very underwhelming in the central role, and Nicholas Clay can't really bring conviction to Launcelot either. Cherie Lunghi looks the part but can't emote. My theory has always been that Boorman looked at the success of ""Star Wars"", which had a young cast of ""unknowns"" supported by veterans like Alec Guinness, and tried to replicate that for ""Excalibur"" to disastrous results. Arthur deserves a more accomplished performer. But Nicol Williamson's Merlin and Helen Mirren's ""Morgana basically compensate for this lack in the film because they are, well.... just so awesome. Despite what seems to be extensive post-dubbing, Williamson really owns the role of Merlin and puts a very unique spin on the character. Always before, in cartoons or in romantic melodramas, he seemed too kindly and benevolent. Here we see a Merlin who has benevolent goals but who even his best friends would be afraid to cross. ""A nightmare to others"" indeed, this Merlin is what you see in him at any particular moment -- he is the dragon where Arthur is the land. You never see all of the dragon, or of Merlin, at any time. His chemistry with Mirren, famously borne of an old lover's spat between the actors, is rightfully the stuff of legend in fantasy film circles. There's a literally palpable distaste mingled with fascination in the air. While I appreciate the presence of actors of such high caliber as Williamson and Mirren, as well as Patrick Stewart and Liam Neeson in supporting roles, it's odd to have so much talent in support and so little evident talent in the lead roles.Boorman and Pallenberg originally worked together on an adaptation of ""Lord of the Rings"" in the early 70s which was never made, and they used a lot of the locations that were planned for that film and also some story ideas for that film here in ""Excalibur."" I was watching for these on the most recent viewing. There's Launcelot's wound, which he says will never heal much like the morgul wound of Frodo. And then there's the scene with Percival running through the forest like a wild thing, Launcelot drawing his sword on him as he wakes him, and then waking up to find that Percy has left a roasting rabbit for him. These scenes could have been storyboarded for Gollum and Sam.All in all, I have to say this is still probably the single most impressive film to depict classic European mythology -- comparable even to such films as Fritz Lang's ""Die Nibelungen"" or Jackon's ""Lord of the Rings."" An awful lot of myth is crammed into this one film, where most like those two had to use multiple films. This film has some amount of focus, and yet it also takes in the wonder and the epic scope of the imagination behind it.",Excalibur
40,Vartiainen,One of the finest of Arthurian films,9,28 August 2015,"Excalibur is another retelling of the life of King Arthur Pendragon, in this case by director John Boorman. Based mostly on Thomas Malory's Le Morte d'Arthur, it recounts Arthur's origin as the son of Uther Pendragon, follows him through his teenage years in service to Sir Ector, through his days in Camelot and finally ends with him sailing to Avalon. If you've ever heard about King Arthur, you know approximately how the story will play out, but that doesn't take away from the experience at all in this case because it's all in how you tell the story.The best word to describe the style of Excalibur is theatrical. The film makers themselves freely admit that they went for an ahistorical retelling. Knights are in full plate mail, even though it hadn't been invented yet at the time, Arthurian myths and legends are freely meshed together from different sources and the dialogue always chooses epicness over realism. And it all works really well for the movie's advantage. The whole film has a fantastic feeling of myth surrounding it. You really feel like you're watching an epic as the characters come together with the fate of whole England on their shoulders.The actors are also very talented. Nigel Terry plays the role of Arthur throughout the whole film, which is slightly problematic when the character is supposed to be a teenager (Terry was 35 at the time), but he gets better from there and absolutely nails the role of a suffering, dying monarch in the final third. The standout role, however, goes to Nicol Williamson as Merlin. This is an absolutely blast of a character. Wiser than anyone else, yet slightly unhinged from having lived on for so long, Williamson gives us just the right amount of over the top while still also selling the quieter scenes with equal amount of grace.Excalibur is one fine film and probably my favourite of the Arthurian films in general. It's a grand, sweeping epic that knows it's sometimes better to achieve a mood rather than stick to iron hard realism.",Excalibur
41,FiendishDramaturgy,Simply Magickal,10,14 August 2003,"I saw this movie in the theater 127 times. Paid for it 127 times. It was a very moving piece of cinema. Well told, beautifully portrayed and brilliantly captured.While it is beginning to show signs of wear about the edges, this movie is the epitome of the King Aurhur legend. It has every element, every character, every nuance one would expect to find. But it also has some beneficial extras which allow you to become involved in this beautiful, treacherous web of intrigue, magick, love, and death.Each scene was shot with a creative eye and love for the craft of film making. The set designs were awesomely executed, leaving one with a rock-solid sense of realism. The symbolism used is astounding considering the amount of research which had to have been done.The Quest for the Holy Grail within this telling is metaphorically representative of each man's search for immortality, a sense of self, and inner enlightenment. It shows we must go on our own journeys, make our own mistakes, and pass our own tests in order to gain the insights one needs to feel whole and complete as an adult and a person.This work bears some of the best musical score I've ever heard. Trevor Jones' score set the entire mood of this film, carried it through the few spots, and uplifted it to a level it otherwise may not have found.While the various versions of Arthur were excellently portrayed and artfully executed, Nicol Williamson's portrayal of Merlin was pure silk. The beautiful cinematography and Nicol Williamson's performance allow you to believe you are a part of the actual events surrounding the King Arthur legend. Nicol Williamson was the shining star of this work. He made it real, for me.It rates a 9.8/10 from...the Fiend :.",Excalibur
42,generationofswine,An Honest Review,10,10 August 2021,"I just showed this to my wife... and she laughed at it. It honestly hurt, because this movie was epic. This movie was a legend...... but my wife is from a totally different generation. She's a Millennial. I'm Gen-X. This kind of thing happens a lot, but this time it happened to Excalibur... and that kind of touched a nerve, especially since she liked the '04 King Arthur movie and you can't wash that film off you with a good shower.Anyway, since I first saw this as a little kid... I kind of became a historian, and one of those ones that firmly believe that he was a real figure. Re-watching it now, yeah, they kind of confused him with the Fisher King a bit didn't they? They kind of made it...not the 6th century. They kind of left out the Saxons.... and most importantly... where is the killer bunny?... yeah, I'm not going to get too deep into the historian kick. I'll say that if you move Charlemagne back a couple hundred years and a couple hundred miles out of France he's going to be a legendary and mythical figure too... and not just one that conspiracy theorists use.... and this isn't historical Arthur, this is Thomas Malory's Arthur.It's a little too Malory and not enough Geoffrey, but it's EPIC Malory, and probably one of the best translations of his King Arthur to the silver screen that you'll ever see... and that alone makes it such a great movie.And then it looks ethereal, and it really plays up the Welsh, the red dragon, and makes a connection there that Malory wished he would have thought of first. It took that quintessentially Welsh narrative and twisted it enough to make a connection that really needed to be in Arthurian Legend.And they did a great job of focusing on the story more than the characters, but it has that added appeal of having everyone who was about to be a big name actor from the UK taking up a role in it. So that's fun.Beyond that.... how do you add spoilers to a movie where everyone knows the story?IDK.Watch it, but remember it's dated, so dated that maybe it doesn't sit well with the newer generations.",Excalibur
43,freemantle_uk,The most acturate Arthurian film,8,6 May 2013,"The legends of King Arthur are so famous that most people know the very basics about legends. But because of centuries of alterations that most people have a shrewd view of the legends. John Boorman's 1981 Excalibur film sets out to be closer to the original Medieval legends and it is the closest we are going to get to them on screen.In the Dark Ages a land is a lawless land and is hindered by civil war. One man, Uther Pendragon (Gabriel Byrne) was able to proclaim himself king through force and cements his rule with the powerful sword Excalibur. But his power corrupts him, breaking an alliance because of his lust and uses Merlin's (Nicol Williamson) magic to fulfil his lust, but any child created from the union goes to Merlin.Years later Excalibur has been placed in a stone and whoever can lift it can be the king and a teenager Arthur (Nigel Terry), a squire to a knight is able to lift the sword. Soon the land is bound to Arthur, if Arthur prospers, so does the land and if he fails, the land and people suffer. During his reign he finds love with Guenevere (Cherie Lunghi) and forms a friendship and rivalry with Lancelot (Nicholas Clay) and suffers from a great threat in the form of sorceress and his half-sister, Morgana (Helen Mirren).Excalibur is a proper adult fantasy film that is filled with violence battle scenes and nudity and does not shy away from the implied rapes and the incest storyline that more child/family friendly versions shy away from. There are some liberties and there are different variations of the legends, the English versions were more grounded and realistic and French versions were more fantasy based, Excalibur still serves as a good summary of Arthurian legends.Excalibur is similar to other darker sword and sorcery films made at the time, particular Conan the Barbarian for his violence, general tone and having incredible film scores. Trevor Jones does supply an excellent score, using original music and classical tunes. Visually Boorman uses both dark visuals in the beginning during the time of chaos and the time of disaster in the beginning and end of the film and juxtaposed it to the brighter visuals when Arthur is at the high of his powers. Boorman does bring you into this medieval world, making you feel the dirt and mud and shows the highs and lows of it and with the costumes and art direction get the right balance between realism and fantasy. It was clear Excalibur did have some budgetary limitations because the battle scenes were pretty small scale and the special effects were weak, even for 1981 standards, Boorman was able to make it work and found ways around it.When the land was decay Boorman does the audience to feel the despair of the people and used some really dark visuals, such as hanging bodies with crows peaking at the dead men's fresh. Whilst a couple scenes did remind me of Monty Python and the Holy Grail on the most part Excalibur is an atmospheric film.The big problem with Excalibur is the acting, with some actors being so hammy that you could make sandwiches out the performances. The most notable was Williamson as Merlin and some moments in the films were funny, but it is unclear if was deliberate or accidental. Mirren is a strong performer as we all know and she did bring out a creepy, manipulative character and we do get see small appearances from Liam Neeson and Patrick Stewart.The 1980s was a period where a lot of sword and sorcery films and Excalibur is one of the best because of the strength of the man behind the camera and the excellent use of the source material, giving us one of the most loyal Arthurian adaptations. It is a shame adult fantasy films cannot be made now.",Excalibur
44,dee.reid,"The man, the sword, the legend - ""Excalibur""",10,23 December 2004,"I'm going to make this short and to the point:In high school, I got my first taste of one of the greatest legends ever told, the legend of King Arthur. I learned all about how a young squire, whose own irresponsibility (forgetting his brother's sword) sets him on a course with destiny. He searches everywhere, but eventually finds a sword, one that's been driven into a stone, and yanks it out with very little trouble. Others try to do the same but are unable to, and then Arthur (Nigel Terry) repeats his action and is crowned as the new king; it was all foreseen by the wizard Merlin (Nicol Williamson). I learned about how Arthur set about conquering lands, forming the ""Knights of the Round Table,"" befriended Lancelot (Nicholas Clay), who eventually betrays him by sleeping with Guenevere (Cherie Lunghi), and how Morgana (Helen Mirren) and Mordred (Robert Addie) set up Arthur's downfall. John Boorman's film is a beautiful and intricate epic that's sure to last forever and ever as the definitive vision of the ""Legend.""

Actors who would go on to distinguish themselves- Patrick Stewart, Helen Mirin, Liam Neesom, in supporting roles.I hated the Armor. Sorry, 15th Century full body armor had no place in a legend of the Dark Ages... It just made the thing unrealistic.The music- Wagner and Oorf. They both contributed the the ""epic"" nature of the film.This film is based on Mallory, so it essentially reflects Mallory's ideals of knighthood and chivalry that never existed outside of an ideal... but what does?",Excalibur
46,Fluke_Skywalker,A flawed masterpiece,8,24 September 2014,"I have seen many other films that were sunk by fewer and far less grievous flaws than the ones contained in John Boorman's controversial adaptation of the classic Thomas Malory version of King Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table. What does that say then about just how breathtaking those elements that do succeed are? Though it's narratively jumbled, with huge leaps in time that often leave it feeling abridged, the film works strictly as a tone poem, with music and visuals working together in perfect unison to create an experience that rises above simple melodrama and soars into the operatic stratosphere where this tale belongs.",Excalibur

This is a very exciting, fast paced epic with brilliant direction, exceptional acting and great cinematography. Nigel Terry makes a very good Arthur, Nicholas Clay plays Lancelot and Cherie Lunghi is Guenevere. There's a lot of chemistry amongst the three. The film is nearly stolen by Nicol Williamson as Merlin. Williamson is much more of a king maker than spell caster. The film is grounded very much in reality so the mystical goings on are even more astonishing. As Morgana, Helen Mirren makes a very sexy sorceress. The music by Trevor Jones adds a lot and Alex Thomson's cinematography captures a very lush, very green Irish countryside. This is one of Boorman's most assured films. The extremely large supporting cast includes Patrick Stewart, Corin Redgrave, Liam Neeson (as Sir Gawain), Gabriel Byrne (as Uther Pendragon) and Charley Boorman (the director's son) as the child Mordred.",Excalibur

His interest in myth, dream, landscape and memory may be compared with that of Resnais, Leone, and Roeg...Boorman's 'Excalibur' is characterized by his use of jealousy and adultery, sex and sorcery... It is also characterized by fire and fog, shadow and moonlight, creating an air of mystery that is essential element in the Arthurian legend...Boorman's 'Excalibur' is a mythical presentation leading the viewers to travel with the flow of the legend... It is a magical story with wonderful exotic sets, and interesting camera-work in the lush green scenery of Ireland... (The Cinematography won an Academy Award Nomination).Boorman's ""Excalibur"" is both fantasy and philosophy... Love seems to be a destructive force, lyrically beautiful and bravely realistic...The film brings to life the fateful story of a solitary hero, his ascension to the throne, the love triangle of Camelot, the quest for the Holy Grail, the decline and eventual fall of Arthur and Camelot... Along for the ride are his indispensable Knights of the Round Table, particularly Sir Lancelot...The characters in Boorman's ""Excalibur"" are extremely well developed... Arthur is seen as a naive squire, who develops into an idealistic king... Arthur tries to use Might for the establishment of Right, and according to his own laws, he puts reason over love...A prominent figure in the film is Merlin... He lives backwards, which makes him ""a dream to some, a nightmare to others."" He defines the cave of the dragon as a place where all things meet their opposite: ""The future and the past, desire and regret, knowledge and oblivion"". But when Morgana pronounces ""love"", one would expect Merlin to answer ""hate"", but he just says: ""O yes.""Morgana knows that Uther and Merlin are responsible for the death of her father... She dedicates her life to revenge.. Her scenes with Merlin are full of fire and poison... When she steals the ""charm of making"" from Merlin, Morgana gets stronger... We feared her lines when she affirmed: ""I can ease your loneliness.""Lancelot looks at himself as a sinful person who has betrayed a friend... He stays lonely in the forest, haunted by sorrow and pain... He dreams of a fight with himself... And when he wakes up naked, he sees his own sword stuck in his side... The film endures and inspires because it embodies mankind's deepest yearnings...Among the many elements that make the movie work is the cast: Nigel Terry, the rightful King who, accidentally, removes the sword of power easily, not once, but twice; Helen Mirren, the enchantress Morgana, Merlin's nemesis and Arthur's treacherous half-sister, who seduces Merlin, and then encircles him in a stream of vengeance; Nicholas Clay, persuasively ardent and athletic as the First Knight; Cherie Lunghi, the damsel in distress who loves her husband with her mind and Lancelot with her heart; Nicol Williamson, the wily Merlin who would see that the young Arthur receive the necessary training and guidance to fulfill his unlikely destiny; Gabriel Byrne, the hot-blooded Uther Pendragon, who plunges 'Excalibur' deep into a stone rock in one last act of defiance; Katrine Boorman, the woman taken as by a fully armored King; Liam Neeson, the knight who dares to accuse the Queen; and Robert Addie, the 'unholy child' who comes to Camelot to demand the throne of his father...One of the more fascinating aspects of the film (and there are many...) are the differences between Uther and Arthur... King Uther is unable to master his instincts... His world is confusion, disorder, and unlimited passion... The characteristic developments of Arthur occur as he faces the trials of his life... The knowledge of the affair yet his love for his beautiful wife and best friend wage war inside of his mind... When he sees Guinevere in the arms of Lancelot, he stuck 'Excalibur' between them loosing his connection to the extraordinary powers of Merlin and the Lady of the Lake...John Boorman's films frequently concern contradictions and polarities, tensions between nature and civilization, dream and reality...

49,slokes,"Well-condensed Malory, but missing some ingredients",7,3 October 2003,"It's hard to quibble overmuch with the impossibly lush and rousing tone poem of the eyes and ears that's John Boorman's ""Excalibur."" It's one of the best pure fantasies ever to hit the big screen, a capable retelling of the Arthur legend and, at times, a thrilling piece of cinema one is eager to share with friends.The problem is the story is too big to contain the film, even one as grand and epic in its reach (or overreach) as this. To focus more attention on a particular aspect might have left people wondering about the rest, but would have provided some needed plot discipline and encouraged the viewer to empathize with the characters rather than simply enjoy them. Even reading John Steinbeck's ""Acts Of King Arthur And His Noble Knights,"" itself a radically compressed account of ""Morte d'Arthur"" by Sir Thomas Malory, is to get a sense of the many verdant nooks and crannies left unexplored by necessity in this film. Like the fact Merlin's fate is sealed not by Morgana, but Nyneve, another sorceress of decidedly different character than her rival Morgana. Or how Arthur's subjugation of his realm involves years of hard fighting and diplomacy with friends and enemies alike.I could have done without the business of the Grail. It's a vital piece of the total Arthurian legend, mind, but it slows down things and calls attention to the shaky balancing act Boorman is purposely performing between the legend's pagan roots and its Christian dressings. I think Christianity is a vital part of the Camelot story, but Boorman sidesteps it effectively enough here I would have been content to let that part slip by. As it is, the Grail thing comes out of left field and distracts us too much from the main story just as it reaches its denouement.But so much else is good about this film. The brooding, fog-choked moors imbued with the green light of renewal and hope, the clunky battles of armor-bedecked maniacs, the gorgeous bodices on fair maidens that seem to ache for the ripping, and the sense of wonderment and possibility around every corner, especially when Merlin's about. Sheer magic.For those who only know Arthur from Bugs Bunny or Monty Python, this is a great place to start learning more. The film's best performance, as so many note here, is Nicol Williamson's Merlin. He growls his best lines in such a way to bestow them with both humor and authority, and uses his eyes the same way another necromancer would a wand. He's above the people who operate around them, he's not human at all, yet in a strange way he is, as Boorman and Williamson capture him.The other actors are quite fine, though keeping track of them all seems more a function of traffic management than true directing. It's early days in the careers of Liam Neeson, Patrick Stewart, and Gabriel Byrne, and they give solid if not spine-tingling performances. Maybe they were less eager performers when they realized they had second billing to the likes of Nigel Terry, Cherie Lunghi, Paul Geoffrey, and the late Nicholas Clay. All four are good, by the way, and Lunghi particularly shines with her beauty and charm, but it's not a surprise none really developed major recognition beyond their roles here, at least on this side of the Atlantic. They are serviceable, at times brilliant, but never compelling.Finally, Boorman is one of the most puzzling directors around, perhaps by design. What can you say about a director who has two of the worst films ever made on his résumé, ""Zardoz"" and ""Exorcist II"", and yet remains a compelling filmmaker over four decades? His visual sense is so unique, powerful, and uncompromising that he is forgiven faults that would sink the careers of lesser artists, or even just less headstrong ones. He's an impossible eccentric, and I get the feeling from watching him here and elsewhere that his dream project would involve having his immediate family strut up and down the screen stark naked for 90 minutes, but ""Excalibur"" shows the method behind the madness, and justifies the excess.",Excalibur

This is by far the best movie about the legend of King Arthur. The cast is excellent and played stone cold serious with some really excellent Shakespearian British actors. The film plays in an operatic manner with an excellent score with some violent action bits that have a very gritty, earthy quality to them. The theme of the film is that the land and the king are one and as the king prospers, so do the land and its people. In this film, everything is cyclical and a such is about balance, when everything comes full circle. Magic is dark and esoteric and is connected with nature and the ancient pagan ways. Nigel Terry is truly excellent as Arthur and has a tremendous supporting cast of now well known and highly respected actors such as Patrick Stewart, Helen Mirren,Gabriel Byrne and Liam Neeson all giving memorable, strong performances here. Excalibur is a truly captivating movie and while I regard Conan The Barbarian as the absolute best of 80's fantasy action movies, then Excalibur is the next most important film in the genre and absolutely essential for fans of the genre and for anyone that can appreciate a really well done film, Excalibur is a true work of art.",Excalibur
52,Witchfinder-General-666,Glorious Version of the Arthurian Legend,8,9 September 2008,"The legend of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table has been filmed several times so far. I've had immense interests in ancient myths and legend as long as I can remember, and the Legend of King Arthur is easily one of the most fascinating ever since stories have been told. While my personal favorite film on the topic is still the Monty Python's ingenious ""Monty Python And The Holy Grail"" (as far as I am considered, easily one of the funniest films ever made), ""Excalibur"" is my personal favorite out of all the 'serious' films on the famous legend. This is not least due to the fantastic atmosphere which ancient legends call for. Unlike many other films on the topic (such as the classic ""Knights of the Round Table"" of 1961, or the forgettable ""King Arthur"" of 2004), John Boorman's 1981 film makes no attempt at being 'realistic', or to explain the fantastic and supernatural elements with stories that could take place in real life. ""Excalibur"" tells a legend - and it remains a legend in doing so. Telling the classic heroic saga, the film uses many elements of the Sword & Sorcery genre which was extremely popular in the 80s, and it does so with utmost greatness. The film is highly atmospheric, and the atmosphere ranges from dazzling fairytale-like moments to raw, gloomy and archaic parts.I do not suppose that the Arhurian legend needs a plot description, as most people know it at least roughly. The cast of ""Excalibur"" includes several fantastic British character actors. Nigel Terry fits well in his role of King Arthur, but he is easily surpassed by some of the other actors. The greatest performances come from the wonderful Helen Mirren, who is brilliant as always in the role of Arthur's sister, the sorceress Morgana, and from the great character actor Nicol Williams who is great as Merlin. The supporting cast furthermore includes actors such as Gabriel Byrne, Liam Nesson and, most memorably, Patrick Stewart in the role of Leondegrace. The film does not scant with sex and violence, which is something I always appreciate, especially for a legend of the kind (since high budget productions often cut back on these elements in order to reach wider audiences). The photography and sceneries are fantastic. The film has some incredibly cheesy moments, but, in my opinion, even those fit in perfectly. All things considered ""Excalibur"" is a fantastic and highly atmospheric film which I highly recommend to all fans of cinema.",Excalibur
53,I_Ailurophile,"Imperfect but entertaining, and made with great care",8,4 October 2021,"Derived from renowned legend by way of a classic interpretation and otherwise adaptation, 'Excalibur' fits neatly into the wealth of fantasy films that saw release in the 1980s. Swords, sorcery, myth, allegory, and classic themes of love, loyalty, bravery, pride, and more are all swept up in an epic tale cobbling together various bits and pieces of Arthurian lore. The resulting picture falls short of perfection, but is highly enjoyable and noteworthy.The greatest consistent strength of the film is in the visuals, for 'Excalibur' is an absolute feast for the eyes. The special effects are average for the timeframe, and suitable. Much more fetching are the beautiful filming locations, and elaborate set design. Details like hair, makeup, and props get fine attention, and there's great use of lighting, too. Above all, the costume design is simply phenomenal, with every last vestige and piece of armor crafted with utmost care. I can only imagine how bulky and unwieldy some of the outfits must have been to wear them on set each day, but the pay-off is immense.Similarly, it's very much worth mentioning the contributions of John Boorman as director, and as co-writer with Rospo Pallenberg. As written and as executed, scenes are expertly arranged. This goes for the choreography as well - of fight scenes, yes, but dance as well. The script itself is quite fine, though all these aspects are a bit ham-handed at times, and one understands clearly what sort of grandiosity Monty Python were lampooning with their 1975 'Holy grail' classic.And before we even start watching, the cast is grabbing. Patrick Stewart only has a small supporting part, but it's always a joy to see him, and this marks a pretty early film role of Liam Neeson, too. Everyone on hand is fantastic - superb actors well exceeding the material, whatever one may think of it - but extra special mention must be made for a couple actors in particular. Nicol Williamson is wonderful as Merlin, deftly shifting between the wizard's varied moods - sometimes sage and stoic, sometimes playful and sardonic, and at other points outright cantankerous. Whatever the part calls for, Williamson has great presence, and commands the robes as though they were his own. Even more than that: to date this may well be the most young I've ever seen Helen Mirren in her turn as antagonistic Morgana Le Fay. Mirren is truly a world-class artist, and even in this fantasy romp she proves it with a performance that serves as a super foil to Williamson's cheeky mentor. Morgana is highly intelligent, underhanded, and devious, and in Mirren portrays the sorceress with an imperiousness both sly and imposing. Just as much as the outstanding visuals, one of the great joys of 'Excalibur' is watching her at play.For everything that the movie gets right, it does have its faults, and I mostly speak of the screenplay. In a runtime of 141 minutes, the writing still feels ham-handed and often terribly rushed. The careful consideration of some scenes is contrasted with inelegant execution of others. I do like the plot, though sometimes it feels thin. So much story is jammed into the length that the flow too often feels strenuous and forced. Admittedly, however, this could well just be an issue chalked up to the difficulty of trying to condense such a long, huge saga - spanning years in-universe - into a single feature film.Putting that aside, though, almost everything else is pretty great. I love the music, including both composer Trevor Jones' original score, and the implementation of classic pieces like Carl Orff's 'O Fortuna.' The initial scenes of the prologue are jarring and disquieting for their violence and cruelty - contrasting with the otherwise more evenly fantastical tone of much of the film, but also pairing readily with the dark turn the feature takes later on. It's not perfect, and between significant violence, more than a little nudity, and instances of sexual assault, this won't find favor with all viewers. Yet anyone prepared to sit through the picture with all its ups and downs is in for a great time.Initially greeted with mixed regard, today this stands as a classic of the fantasy genre, and rightly celebrated for the imagery on display.

It begins with Arthurs father Uther and his pact with Merlin and tells the entire story of Arthur's life.Comments: Oh, tell a tale with swords and shiny armors, and you got me. And there are lots of swords and the armor is almost ridiculously shining. No need to say much about the story. It is a classic (in every sense of the word). It got elements of courage, love, betrayal, and death. It got fiery battles, magic and tender moments.However, I not entirely convinced by the directing. It actually annoyed me that every sentence in the dialog seemed to end with an exclamation mark. It was actually worse than 300. There is just no need for it. A story with those elements, those changes in pace and emotion should be able to change tone in the dialog too.The cast is interesting though. It is fun too see Patrick Stewart, Liam Neeson and Gabriel Byrne in very early roles, especially in shining armor and with drawn swords.So, anyone who likes knights and swords should like this movie, as I did. But it could have been better...7/10",Excalibur

Unlike White's version, Excalibur deals with several areas of the Arthur legacy including his father Uther and Merlin's involvement. The entire first chapter of White's book is missing from this movie except for the classic scene with Arthur pulling the sword from the stone.

56,Jonny_Numb,Sir Thomas Malory rolls in his grave,4,30 June 2007,"Wow. Maybe it's just me, but I think ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" is a far more reverent rendering of Sir Thomas Malory's ""Le Morte Darthur."" ""Excalibur"" comes closer to the John Boorman of ""The Exorcist II"" rather than the John Boorman of ""Deliverance""--the film is epic in scale (lord knows it runs long enough, at 141 minutes), but absolutely gonzo in its execution (in some ways, it's actually like a long Monty Python sketch, sans humor). The sets are gaudy, cluttered to the point of distraction; Merlin (Nicol Williamson) is reduced to a cosmic jester with a silver pate; Arthur (Nigel Terry) is unimpressive in performance and character; the remaining knights (Lancelot, Gawain, Kay, among others) fade in and out of the action, and the periodic shifts in focus are often confounding. The film is arguably most problematic in its compression of a 500-page book into a 2 1/2-hour movie, leaving certain plot elements poorly explained (if explained at all), certain characterizations minimized (or excised), and a feeling of overall tonal disjointedness. Boorman pulls out all the stops in making ""Excalibur"" an Arthurian tale of grand cinematic excess, but ultimately misses the humanity; the result is a cold, detached film that runs way too long.",Excalibur
57,Steffi_P,"""Dragon's breath""",9,29 October 2011,"The 1980s are known as a decade of style over substance. That's why there were so many fantasy movies, full of magic and lofty ideals but noticeably lacking in dramatic credibility. Excalibur is one of the first 80s fantasy pictures, and also one of the most bizarre. Full of sex and gore, carried out with dreamlike surrealism and possessing a shameless silliness, this is one of the greatest triumphs of style over substance ever to grace our screens.Perhaps the oddest thing about Excalibur is its cast. You have to wonder where director John Boorman got some of these people. In Nigel Terry we have a King Arthur with a thick Bristol accent, perhaps vaguely appropriate since King Arthur is often said to be from the West Country, but it's hardly the most regal of brogues. Terry successfully portrays Arthur as both the fresh-faced squire and the grizzled old ruler, but apart from that there isn't much special in his performance. He has some painfully bad moments, such as all the blustering and blinking he does when he confronts Gawain over Guinevere's fidelity. Then we have Nicol Williamson, whose portrayal of Merlin veers between the theatrical and the tongue-in-cheek, worth a chuckle at times and certainly gaining points for differentness. There are some familiar treats among the supporting players, but even these are pretty weird choices, such as Clive Swift (best known as the archetypal put-upon husband in a certain 90s sitcom) playing Arthur's adoptive father Sir Ector. And everyone looks so much of the time Excalibur was made. Even Nicholas Clay (Lancelot) is handsome in a very 80s way. He looks like he would wear a headband, and go jogging a lot.If you are familiar with John Boorman's style you can see this as a kind of fantasy equivalent of his surreal sci-fi masterpiece Zardoz. It is supremely and beautifully rhythmic, with scenes that segue to music and build up to intense climaxes. Boorman's shots are simply exquisite, with compositions that emphasise a vast depth and sprawling width just with careful placement of figures, such as the knights dotted around the river bank during Outher's truce with Gorlois, creating spaces that seem at once very solid but also quite unreal in their distortion. But it is Boorman's imagery that really makes Excalibur stand out; a snake curling around the foreground of Morgana's lair, the inexplicable green tinge of the forest or the impenetrable fog of battle, not to mention knights having sex in full battle armour before a backdrop of flames. I first saw this movie when I was about twelve, and the images have seared themselves into my memory. Boorman is in many ways an heir of the greatest British director Michael Powell, even if he seems lack the earlier filmmaker's gift for pathos.And strange as it is, Excalibur all fits together very well. The frequent use of Orff's ""O Fortuna"" is rather appropriate, the words of that piece being from the heretical medieval text Carmina Burana. The Alex Thomson cinematography is dazzlingly baroque, full of striking natural light and unnatural colour. Costume designer Bob Ringwood fashions armour almost reminiscent of industrial machinery (remember this picture is a contemporary of Mad Max II). Yes, the whole thing is incredibly ostentatious, there is some woeful acting and dialogue, but as if in recognition of this the makers have gone for broke in terms of look, polish and sheer madness of ideas. This is a work of fantasy cinema that is truly fantastical.",Excalibur
58,ShootingShark,The One God Comes To Drive Out The Many Gods,7,25 July 2011,"In the Dark Ages, a necromancer called Merlin guides the destiny of Arthur, a boy fated to be King and to unite the realm with the aid of an invincible sword.The Arthurian legends are great stories and there have been a lot of agreeable movies based on them, from straight adaptations like Prince Valiant, First Knight and the recent King Arthur, to the animated The Sword In The Stone, even a musical (Camelot). The best of all is Monty Python And The Holy Grail. But the best serious one is Excalibur. It manages the tricky task of amalgamating most of the main ideas from Thomas Malory's fifteenth-century eight-book opus La Morte D'Arthur, tying them together using Merlin as an overarching link and ranging over several decades, yet still somehow keeping the narrative tight and flowing. Equally impressive is its mythical and magical feel, despite a relatively modest budget and sparse effects - it does this through great staging, theatrical performances and superb photography by the great Alex Thomson. The Irish locales are lush and evocative, alternating shimmering valleys and grand castles with the blood and mud of sweaty jousts and battles. Anthony Pratt's sets are terrific, and the costumes by Bob Ringwood (Dune, Batman, A.I.) are sensational, from Lancelot - the original knight in shining armour - to Morgana's slutty gowns to Merlin's sweeping cloak. The cast are all very good, carefully balancing the big-and-loud acting required without ever toppling over the edge into hysteria. The cast was largely unknown at the time and it's strange that the supporting players (Mirren, Byrne, Stewart and Neeson) are the ones who went on to stardom, but everyone is good here; Williamson has the role of a lifetime as the watchful, mischievous, cantankerous old sorcerer, and Mirren is deliciously evil as his rapacious understudy. The final element in this rich tapestry is Trevor Jones' excellent score, which is mystical, exciting and scary all at once, with terrific interludes from Wagner's Parsifal and Tristan & Isolde (both of which themselves are based on Arthurian tales) and perhaps the definitive use of Carl Orff's classic O Fortuna cantata from Carmina Burana, as a restored Arthur rides through the countryside, his new-found health rejuvenating the land around him. Boorman extracts all he can from his actors and technicians and creates an extraordinarily stylish, exciting, romantic and evocative picture. Even if you don't like the sword-and-sorcery genre, don't miss this classic British adventure movie of one of the oldest and most influential stories in the history of literature.

59,davidmvining,John Boorman is a crazy person.,7,13 January 2020,"This is a film that needs to be watched differently from most films. It operates very differently from the more realistic bent that the vast majority of films lend themselves towards and leans very heavily into a much more formalistic approach. It's an effort to bring Romantic painting to life with an operatic feel, and if you can't get into that different style of reality, then the movie's going to just be funny. Buy into the hyper-reality, though, and you have an entertaining 140 minutes ahead of you.Everything about this film is big. Costumes entail men walking everywhere in full plate armor. Sets are huge and completely impractical. Performances reach for the rafters. The world is filled with magic and the implication of a huge dragon. It's very much of its own style, and the fact that Zach Snyder considers Excalibur his favorite movie makes just so much sense.It's the traditional Arthurian legend filtered through the crazy mind of John Boorman. It goes beyond the formalistic stylistic approach to the story, but the inclusion of every weird factor of the original myths plays into Boorman's wheelhouse. Merlin using the magic of the dragon to disguise Uther to trick Igraine is a prime example. But Boorman also includes some extra-mythical elements like having Morgana be Mordred's mother and Arthur his father, creating an incestuous relationship that was never there before. It's rather fertile feeding ground for Boorman's insanity, and I'm really glad he used it.It blows through the Arthurian legend, mostly propelled by Nicol Williamson's awesomely weird performance as Merlin, watching Uther father Arthur, Arthur claim the sword in the stone and rise to become king, the peace that follows, and the dissolution of that peace precipitated by the affair between Guinevere and Lancelot. Alongside is the rise of Morgana, her tutelage under Merlin, and her raising of Mordred. All of this is big and entertaining (if weird and uncomfortable at certain moments), but it's the late introduction of the Grail Quest that kind of derails the latter half of the film for me.The Grail isn't mentioned until about 90 minutes into the film, and it's just very suddenly dropped in as a very important thing that needs to be found right then. Arthur is sick, the country is sick, and they need something to revive the nation and its king. Suddenly, ""Hey, Percival, go find the Holy Grail.""The Grail Quest feels really tacked on. There are some striking visuals like the actual vision of the Grail that Percival has and the image of Percival hanging from the tree because of where the Quest took him, but it's a sudden late introduction that actually doesn't come to fruition. Maybe if the Grail had been introduced earlier in the film it would have worked better, but as it is, it feels like the Grail is in the film because it's a common part of the Arthurian legend and not because there was a compelling reason to include it in this telling.Overall, though, the film is really quite an experience. Divorced from reality and existing in its own fantasy realm, it creates its own rules of behavior and sticks to them. It's really pretty from beginning to end, well using the Irish countryside (around John Boorman's house) with mise-en-scene that really evokes Romantic paintings. The performances, especially Nicol Williamson's as Merlin, fit well with the material, and it's an entertaining look into another reality that follows different rules from our own.",Excalibur
60,pc95,A Favorite Fantasy Movie,9,28 November 2016,"Owning this movie for years and years, I've finally gotten around to gushing about it here. There's a Shakespearean quality to Early 80's gem ""Excalibur"" thanks to high quality stage actors recruited and selected by director John Boorman. The script is wonderfully introspective and philosophical. While these are noteworthy, perhaps best of all is the magnanimous score mixed with Oscar-winning Cinematography - unforgettably powerful, strange, and enchanting - all that you could want in a fantasy movie experience. The movie is full of lust and energy. Nicol Williamson, as Merlin, turns in one of the best performances in any fantasy movie with marvelous curiosity and wit. Nigel Terry as Arthur is also excellent, melancholy and earnest, as is Gabriel Byrnes, angry and battle-hardened earlier. A younger Helen Mirren is brooding and enchanting as well. Boorman deserves much credit and praise. He's captured medieval and magic better than movies decades after it. His cast is unparalleled in performance. 9/10 - highly recommended",Excalibur

(R)Boorman's robust, refreshingly adult-oriented retelling of the Arthurian saga, primarily from the source of Thomas Malory's ""Le Morte d'Arthur""; mixture of mythical storytelling and hallucinatory dark magic with bloody, mud-soaked battles and sexual frankness. Covers a lot of ground, perhaps too much for the time allotted (the Grail quest is introduced abruptly and lacks orderly plotting), but its splendidly elaborate production gives the viewer plenty to look at. Trevor Jones provides a few bits of original music, but the well-placed classical pieces by Carl Orff and Richard Wagner are the ones that won't soon be forgotten. Williamson is an arch, eccentric delight as Merlin; the film suffers for his absence during most of the last hour. Kick-started the sword & sorcery boom of the 1980s, none of which could really hold a candle to this unrestrained epic.

62,Spuzzlightyear,Medeival Cheeseball,3,23 October 2004,"John Boorman seemed to have made an interesting trypitch for himself, with Zardoz, Excorcist II and this mess, Excalibur. The plot as it is, focuses on the life and death of Arthur, and the many characters that came and went in his world. Now, I am not the biggest sword and sorcery nut in the world, but surely one could make a film a lot better than this.Following closely on Zardoz's look, the film is largely flash and glitz, with no substance. As a matter of fact, after the first 15 minutes, I was laughing heartily at how hooty the film was. Full of Grade Z acting, laughable special effects and just plain weirdness, this was a sight to behold! Unfortunately, there was another 2 hours of the film to go, and believe me, fair viewer, I tried my best to stay awake during this, but finally the inanity wore me out.

64,classicalsteve,The Best Theatrical Re-Telling of the Arthurian Legend--Largely Based on Malory's Le Morte d'Arthur (1485),10,30 May 2007,"Late in the film, King Arthur is about to fight his last battle against his estranged son Mordred. His kingdom of Camelot is falling. The knights of the Round Table are disbanding. Guinevere has entered a convent. In short, Arthur's world is collapsing. He rides to the nunnery to see Guinevere for the last time. And there, she produces the ancient timeless object hidden beneath some linen: the sword Excalibur, still gleaming, still magical, still potent to fight in the battle that Arthur cannot win. He sheathes Excalibur, and, in full knightly regalia rides with his remaining loyal knights through the English countryside, their pennants and banners flying in the wind. The fortissimo chorus of Carmina Burana accompanies their ride in perfect harmony, chanting the lyrics from the medieval poem ""O Fortuna"". This is the stuff of legend...Artistic treatments of the Arthurian legends date back to illuminated codices from the Middle Ages. Thereafter the first, and one of the greatest, attempts to bring the stories into a novelistic form was written in the late 1400's by a knight, Sir Thomas Malory, entitled La Morte d'Arthur (""The Death of Arthur"") which is probably the most famous work of English letters proceeding Chaucer but before Shakespeare. Even later renditions include T.H. White's ""The Once and Future King"". By the 20th century, theatrical adaptations began appearing as well, including ""Knights of the Round Table"" (1953), Disney's ""The Sword in the Stone"" (1963), and the musical ""Camelot"" by Lerner and Lowe which was possibly the most popular rendition of the story before ""Excalibur"". These last renditions, although they have their appeal, cannot measure up to the movie ""Excalibur"" which was largely based upon Malory's original tome.Many here have detailed very well the merits of the film, and since most people know the story, I will keep this short. The reason why this is the best of the Arthurian-based films is its imagery and its dedication to the original Arthurian myths. The entire look of the film, which I have not seen in a movie since, reeks of Medieval Legend. The lush forests, the huge castles, and the glittering swords give a visual and dream-like reality. This is NOT how it was in the Middle Ages. This is how people in the Middle Ages would have liked it to have been, which is the entire point of the Arthurian myths. The filmmakers of Excalibur understood that myth is about dreams.Several moments in the film are inspired directly from Malory and earlier Medieval codices. For example, several Medieval illuminated manuscripts feature the hand of the Lady of the Lake bestowing the sword Excalibur to Arthur. Strangely this episode, which becomes an important theme throughout Excalibur, is lacking from other theatrical versions and yet it is central to the original myth. Another is the strange rhetoric that Arthur and the land are one, and when Arthur becomes ill, the land of his kingdom becomes barren. This concept was a widely held belief in the Middle Ages: that the sovereign was essentially married to the kingdom.Another aspect that makes this film outstanding is the portrayal of Merlin by Nicol Williamson. This was possibly the best Merlin ever to come to the large screen. Some of the most humorous moments of the film occur with Merlin. Instead of being the absent-minded wizard of ""The Sword in the Stone"", he is the last of the Druids, a race giving way to Medieval Christians. Worth the price of admission. It is sad that he obtained very little recognition for this portrayal.The fact is, a viewer either experiences ""aesthetic arrest"" with Excalibur, or he or she doesn't. If the scenes when the knights go riding through countryside with their pennants flying behind them doesn't give you the shivers, this is not and will never be your kind of movie. If Malory had lived to see this film, he would have been awed and proud. Malory gave Arthur to the world, and Excalibur gave Arthur back to Malory.",Excalibur
65,SanteeFats,Great stuff,10,7 July 2013,"This movie is so well done. There is good humor, especially the portrayal by Nicol Williamson as Merlin. His acting and the inflections he places on his dialogue are so funny even when the subject matter is serious. The naive squire that first appears and takes the sword from the stone (ring a bell?) is so unassuming and unprepossessing that he is funny until he gets the throne and gets Guenevere as his queen. Of course she turns out to be a tramp and hooks up with Sir Lancelot. When Arthur finds out the consequences for the country. Every thing falls to wrack and ruin as Arthur falls into a depression and just doesn't care about anything. Morgana has raped Arthur by means of magic and born a son by him. At the end Arthur kills his son on the battle field and tries to get a squire to throw his sword into the lake, which he does not do. The battle scenes are pretty well done and the armor is very authentic as far as I can tell.",Excalibur
66,phubbs,Excalibur,7,29 April 2017,"Set in the wilds of Ireland and with a pretty full cast of Irish actors, which set in motion the careers of both Liam Neeson and Gabriel Byrne, whilst also utilising some classic/cult British names for spice.Like Robin Hood there are many stories of the legendary King Arthur and his Knights of the round table but this film is probably the most accurate in terms of an adaptation from original period text. This film is based around the tales from 'Le Morte d'Arthur' and seems to follow each 'segment' quite closely (haven't read it so I'm not sure).The overall essence of this film is like a fairy tale of sorts, a kind of slightly cheesy shiny armoured fantasy with glittery sets, soft colours, strong religious/iconic imagery and a Clannad vibe running through it. The film reminded me of the classic British TV series 'Robin of Sherwood' (which also starred the dastardly Robert Addie) and the classic British fantasy film 'Krull'. I think the latter took inspiration from the visual aspect of 'Excalibur', possibly.The design and look of this film is really very good, its clearly rather dated but it still has a high polish to it and looks quite epic. The locations really give an authentic feel, an solid impression of old medieval England complete with excellent costumes. Of course this being the 80's the armour does look a bit fake, a bit plastic, flimsy and too shiny in places. There is also a kind of music video feel to the proceedings in places. Some sets look a bit too sparkly, some characters have some dubious haircuts and to be utterly honest the acting and dialog is pretty hilarious in places, but you can't deny the effort and scope of this historical fantasy.This being in the days before CGI when historical epics were all the rage, the battle sequences are small with some blood and minimal gore. You can easily tell they didn't have a big crew to make such grand battles so clever editing is used with lots of darkness and fog. Luckily old England was a foggy place...or so I've been led to believe. The other slightly amusing thing was the soundtrack, there is original work here but the use of classical pieces slapped on top of key sequences didn't really work (for me at least). The combination of certain scenes and certain pieces of music felt very rickety and really did seem crowbarred in badly. You can see what the director was going for but it comes off more like a parody of sorts, something not too dissimilar from 'Monty Python and the Holy Grail'.The plot is straight forward and it doesn't become dull despite the heavy romance involved. The film is layered and rich, vivid imagery and beautiful design giving the whole production much flare and class. It all works pretty flawlessly because you know these were the days when everything was hand crafted. The film is a cult classic with a bitchin' powerful poster that demands your attention (it draws you in). On a final note, the acting in general may be acceptable but Nicol Williamson's Merlin is also another good reason to see this film. A truly unique quirky take on the character spouting some glorious lines, 'oh that's grand'.7/10",Excalibur
67,Holt344,"Excalibur is a flawed masterpiece, with memorable imagery - among the best interpretations of the Arthurian legends",10,24 October 2021,"Excalibur is a epic medieval fantasy film directed, produced and co-written by John Boorman that retells the legend of King Arthur and the knights of the Round Table, based on the 15th-century Arthurian romance Le Morte d'Arthur by Thomas Malory. You might be confused why I rated this film so high as it could easily be seen as a very flawed film, but underneath those flaws is a masterpiece and that might be hard to believe. Excalibur is truly an interesting film and something I can personally call cinema. The cinematography is superb and the imagery is right off a painting, John Boorman clearly understands the characters and mythology but also respects the legend. With it stunning set pieces, scenery, camera work, costumes and simply the whole production makes this into the flawed masterpiece it is. If we take the writing for example, I find the overall story to be amazing and the world building to be quite great. But some of dialogue is flawed, it's also very poetic in a way. The dialogue might be poorly executed by the actors because of some of them over-acting. But the acting improves in the second act, it's also good to understand that many actors had never done a theatrical film before. Some scenes are also poorly written, and haven't aged well. The pacing is quite slow and might be off putting for some, but I like slow burn films like this one, it's my cup of tea.It stars Nigel Terry as Arthur, Nicol Williamson as Merlin, Nicholas Clay as Lancelot, Cherie Lunghi as Guenevere, Helen Mirren as Morgana, Liam Neeson as Gawain, Gabriel Byrne as Uther Pendragon, Corin Redgrave as Gorlois, Duke of Cornwall, and Patrick Stewart as Leondegrance. With a cast of many well known actors, it's nice to see their faces and see their performances in this epic medieval film. It's about: Merlin the magician who helps Arthur Pendragon unite the Britons around the Round Table of Camelot, even as dark forces conspire to tear it apart. But you're probably not here for the performances, but for the grand scale of the production and to witness an epic film. I do want to give some praise to Nicol Williamson's performance as Merlin, he does it with a light touch but still doing the character justice and showing off every attribute he has. The performances of Nigel Terry as King Arthur and Helen Mirren as Morgana Le Fay is also some that need praise.The battle and action sequences are choreographed nicely and feel chaotic which is realistically with the armors that the knights wore. It's also a very violent movie, both in battles and outside battles. The sexual violence is something that haven't aged well, it's there for story reasons but are completely unnecessary as dialogue between characters could have done it justice or just trim down the scene I'm talking about. I would not recommend this film for children, only older teenagers and adults. But back to the positive side of this review, the film is edited in a great way. The musical score is epic, mystical and suspenseful, fitting the time period perfectly.I also want to add how big a fan of King Arthur and the knights of the Round Table I am, having grown up with it in all forms of media, mostly movies. But I have for some reason never watched this one, and I'm glad I saved it until now as I've such a bigger knowledge of the mythology and that means I can appreciate it more. John Boorman, the director, he have created something memorable and I understand how this can be someone's favorite movie and it seems like it's filmmaker Zack Snyder's favorite film. Is it mine? Far from it, but the imagery and dark take on the Arthurian legends will stick with me for many years and I'm sure I'll rewatch Excalibur sometime in the future.",Excalibur
68,petra_ste,"A dream to some, a nightmare to others",6,1 December 2014,"Today, if you want to start a quarrel in a group of cinephiles, mention Prometheus; once, it was Excalibur - a controversial movie some see as a compelling and reasonably faithful version of the Arthurian myth, others as a wonky mess. Although I lean more towards enjoying the film, I'd argue both sides have a point.Like most long-in-the-making passion projects by talented artists, Excalibur isn't great, but it's interesting. Structure is problematic - there seem to be more narrative ellipses here than in The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, and at times Boorman appears overwhelmed by the material: the ""sword in the stone"" sequence is curiously anticlimactic and feels less mystical here than in the Disney movie. Boorman occasionally taps into striking images: a skirmish in a forest bathed in a sinister orange light; two lovers embracing in a green glade; the titular sword emerging from the silver water held by the hand of the Lady of the Lake; the last confrontation between Arthur (Nigel Terry) and a gold-clad Mordred as they stand silhouetted against a red dusk. Before a recent rewatch I had last seen Excalibur twenty years ago, and I was surprised by how vivid those moments remained in my memory.The movie has a remarkably physical feel, with its roaring fires, armies clashing in the mist, bright-armored knights battling in lush forests and sinking in rivers. Boorman conveys the impression of a lived-in world; the same script filmed today by a lesser director with an overload of green screen and weightless CGI would have been a laughable disaster.Acting ranges from the stiffness of Clay (who was ideally cast as the smug gigolo of Evil Under the Sun but is a limp Lancelot) to the high camp tones of Mirren and Williamson; the latter steals the movie as Merlin with his high-pitched, hammy performance which is memorable in a cult classic kind of way.6.5/10",Excalibur
69,gab-14712,A Fun Re-telling of the King Arthur Mythology!,8,27 February 2019,"I remember the first time I laid my eyes on Excalibur. It was my high school freshman year English class. I thought the movie was incredibly boring. Flash forward a decade later, I took the opportunity to revisit the movie. Thankfully, my opinion changed. This film is a solid take on the King Arthur mythology with hammy (although enjoyable) acting, great special effects and costume designs, a rather violent screenplay, and character development/dialogue that could have been better. Based on that last sentence, you can see that I thought of this film as a mixed bag. In the end, it is a fun fantasy adventure.Ever since learning about the legend of Arthur in grade school, I was always fascinated by this legend. Is this story real? The only thing anthropologists have discovered regarding this legend is some Celtic texts. It is apparent that Arthur was a real person, but I do love all the fantasy stuff added to the story. The Knights of the Round Table, the evil Morgana, the sword in the stone, etc. This particular adaptation is based upon Malory's Le Morte d'Arthur which was one of the original versions of the tale as it was released in 1485 and is considered a great piece of literature. By the 20th century, American audiences were enthralled with this legend as well considering the popularity of films like 1953's Knights of the Round Table and the 1963 Disney flick The Sword in the Stone. With this 1981 feature, people say this is the best adaptation to date. A more spirited, operatic, and philosophical take on the famous tale.The film is directed by John Boorman and was adapted to the screen by Boorman and and Rospo Pallenberg. Prior to this film, Boorman wanted to adapt the Lord of the Rings as his big fantasy movie, but that never came to be. However, his big fantastical ideas live on in this movie with great visuals, lavish costumes, and striking imagery. Boorman also added his own take to the Merlin/Arthur story. When the world was still young, the sword Excalibur was forged and it was given to Uther Pendragon (Gabriel Byrne) by the all-powerful wizard, Merlin (Nicol Williamson). When the violent Uther dies, the sword is cast into stone where the next man who pulls it out would be named the new king of England. Many years later, a squire named Arthur (Nigel Terry) happens to be the one. He also happens to be the illegitimate son of Uther. Arthur is the one to bring peace and prosperity to the kingdom, but his lustful and evil half-sister Morgana (Helen Mirren may have other plans for the kingdom.This movie gives the chance for English thespians to have fun and bring their own style into a legend of old. Sure the acting can be hammy at times, but its clear the cast is having fun. Of course, I would expect Merlin to be an old, wise man with a flowing white beard ala Dumbledore or Gandalf, but this Merlin is different. There is hardly any beard if at all, and Nicol Williamson plays him as a witty wizard that you do not want to get on the wrong side of. Nigel Terry made a great King Arthur, although he portrayed Arthur from young to old as a 35-year-old and the age difference is noticeable. The cast is filled with upcoming stars who would have long careers including Gabriel Byrne, Liam Neeson, Helen Mirren, and Patrick Stewart.Director John Boorman made this film with a philosophical edge. He explores ideas on love, leadership, heritage, among other things. Purists may scoff at this movie, but Boorman has some very close to making the ""perfect"" Arthur movie. The battle scenes are well-staged and visually impressive, the set design is actually rather realistic. Looking at these castles and knights made me think about the actual history of medieval England. I liked the music and the use of Richard Wagner. I wondered why Wagner's music was used, but I understood how well it blended in with the story. The movie is not perfect, but those who do not mind campy action films will have a blast with this King Arthur itineration.My Grade: B-",Excalibur

71,AngelHonesty,Baffled!,1,15 December 2019,"I am baffled how this title got such a high rating. I am an avid movie watcher; I can truly say that this is one of the very few most boring films I have ever watched in my life. The story is incredibly slow and uninteresting. I acknowledge that this is a ""classic"" film and maybe in its day it was a great film; but I would never watch this again.",Excalibur
72,rebeljenn,probably the best Arthur film,5,17 November 2005,"'Excalibur' is based on the classic tale of King Arthur and the knights of the Round Table. It's the best film that I have seen about King Arthur. The film is produced well with attention to detail (just as you would imagine it back in those days) and some good performances...and a general overall good story with a little bit of romance, betrayal, and battles.The best thing about the film is the detail and the cinematography. It's just a visually beautiful film. The story itself, although changing over history and warped with other artistic minds, is Arthurian but not that stunning of a story because we are all familiar with it. Overall, a job well done and it does have a few surprises.",Excalibur
73,grahamsj3,"Good film, superb score",6,19 February 2001,"First, the score, which relies almost exclusively on Wagner's heavy operatic music, is perfectly utilized. Much of the film has a very dark mood, and the use of Wagner underscores that prevailing mood very well. The story is a classic, based on the book ""L'Mort d' Arthur"". The casting and acting are fair at best. However, the story is so strong that it carries the cast! It is easy to be caught up in the beauty and magic that was Camelot. Then, as Merlin says, ""Good and evil...there never is one without the other"" evil shows up. Arthur is betrayed on two fronts. The result is a battle against the forces of evil. This is a film well worth a watch! It is not a great film, but it is a good one. Watch for a crewman moving in the background at one point!",Excalibur
74,Son_of_Mansfield,The Death of Arthur.,8,2 April 2006,"As far as I know, this is the best version of the Arthur legend on film. Unfotunetly, the movie feels like a collection of scenes at many points and is a little too glossy. There are several good scenes including: The bridge duel between Arthur and Lancelot, The short, but deep first look between Lancelot and Gwenevere, Morgana's betrayal of Merlin and Arthur, Merlin's foggy revenge, Mordrid's beating of his mother/lover, and Arthur and Mordrid's final embrace. There are also some scenes that I probably shouldn't have laughed at. Such as when Morgana pushes Mordrid out of herself and thrusts him in the air in one motion or when Lancelot bares his butt to fight himself in an unusually green forest. The cast is good, the fiery Gabriel Byrne, the manipulative Helen Mirren, the drunken Liam Neeson, the passionate Nicholas Clay, the stiff Nigel Terry, the fatherly Patrick Stewart, and the beautiful Cherie Lunghi. The best is Nicol Williamson's goofy Merlin, who steals the movie. The nudity and violence add a nice realism to the film, but it could use more to effectively counter all the chivalry. John Boorman(Delieverance, Point Blank) has made a fine film that still is exciting and grand at twenty-five years old.",Excalibur
75,FloatingOpera7,The Arthurian Epic Gloriously Brought To Life,10,11 April 2006,"Excalibur, Starring Nigel Terry, Nicol Williamson, Helen Mirren, Cheri Lunghi, Nicholas Clay, Liam Neeson, Patrick Stewart, Gabriel Byrne, Robert Addie, Katrine Boorman, Paul Geoffrey, Clive Swift Director John Boorman, 1981 Director John Boorman and screenwriter Rospo Pallenberg worked on adapting the centuries old Thomas Malory epic ""Le Morte D'Arthur"" into a stunning, intensely dramatic movie masterpiece the likes of which had never been seen before. This is, for me, the most definitive version of the Arthurian saga. There is so much to admire about this film and so much to analyze but for lack of time on IMDb I can only offer portions of my praise. Boorman masterfully captures the grandiosity as well as the humanity of the fantasy legend about a young innocent who draws a sword from a stone and inherits the right of kingship, establishes the beautiful city of Camelot and the Knights of the Round Table, who protect the innocent and rid the world of evil, and search endlessly for that most elusive religious artifact - the Holy Grail. First of all, we must look beyond the fantasy elements and the special effects which everyone enjoys - the magic sword Excalibur, itself a symbol of strength and kingship (in the film the Lady of the Lake who gives the sword to Arthur and who receives it again in the finale is played by one of Boorman's daughter Telsche Boorman), the elaborate details of the medieval, Celtic-Christian England from the clothing, to the fortresses, to the armor and weapons, and we must see into the heart of the long epic. First off, Nigel Terry and Nicol Williamson as Arthur and Merlin carry the movie. Their relationship as mentor and protégé has never been most wonderfully portrayed, their friendship as two men who try desperately to fulfill the ideals of brotherhood and who fail has never been more poignantly captured. The most moving part for me is still the climatic finale, in which, after the death of Arthur, and the world seems to have ended, Excalibur is brought back to the Lake and Three mysterious queens take Arthur away on a barge, all this while the dramatic music to Wagner's Siegfried's Funeral March blares triumphantly. Boorman used the music of Wagner's operas most effectively in the relevant spots in the film- the sensual Prelude to Tristan and Isolde plays as Lancelot and Guenevere have their tryst in the forest, the spiritual, ethereal strains of the Good Friday/Holy Grail music from Parsifal plays as Parsifal himself encounters the Holy Grail and Siegfried's Funeral March from Gotterdammerung opens and closes the film as both the Sword Theme and the tragic motif of Arthur's heroic death. The relationship between King Arthur, Queen Guenevere (Cherie Lunghi) and Lancelot (Nick Clay) is also well-developed. For once, we realize how the Queen loved her husband as a king, but because he was so consumed by his duties, she could not love him as a husband. Instead, she finds romantic-sexual gratification in an affair with Lancelot. The Quest for the Holy Grail could have been further elaborated but this is a minor quibble. The film builds up to a fiery finale. The character of the wicked sorceress Morgana (Helen Mirren) is also a strong point, and one everyone misses. She was only a small child (played by Barbara Byrne) when she witnessed the rape of her mother Igrayne (played by Boormans' daughter Katrine) by Uther. This single moment of deception and witchcraft triggered her mistrust of all men and ruins her innocence. She becomes a corrupt, greedy, power-hungry witch who even manages to trap Merlin in an icy cave. Her vengeance against Arthur brings about the final destruction as her evil son Mordred and Arthur fight to their own deaths. Well-known British actors live up to their own possible Arthurian/Brittanic heritage. Patrick Stewart (Captain of the Enterprise on Star Trek) is doing a superb performance as is Liam Neeson even though their roles are minor as knights of the Table. Clive Swift, Sir Kay, is better known as a comic actor in the British series ""Keeping Up Appearances"" he plays Hyancinth's husband Richard. The look of the film is a tapestry of moods. Green is magic, silver-metallic is mankind's power, the forest is a place where Lancelo and Guenvere revel in their primitive essence. It's a world of dark and light, spring and winter, happiness and despair, illusion, but other than its good versus evil themes there are many layers. Humanity is flawed, the end of the world is coming, but the world may still be renewed again. There is no greater truth than this.",Excalibur
76,Hayden-86055,"Very weird, not my sort of thing",6,31 December 2020,Excalibur is a rather bizarre film with a confusing and jumpy plot.

77,innocuous,How can a really bad movie be so good?,6,20 April 2012,"I watch ""Excalibur"" at least once every year and I just finished my annual viewing last night. Once again I was bemused by how well it is regarded by many and how lousy a movie it really is. That's not to say that I don't enjoy the heck out of it. (Doesn't Ebert say that enjoying a movie doesn't mean it's a good movie?) I do, and that's why I watch it.But even fans have to admit that it's a pretty crummy movie. Between the wildly uneven score (the classical music used in certain scenes is really laughable), the histrionic acting, and the weird plot tangents, the film has no right to be regarded as the best film about the Arthurian legends.Still, there are some great moments and some great writing here, if you choose to wade through the dreck.

The stories are ok I guess, but nothing terribly exciting to me. This film had some good stuff in it, but overall, nothing to get hyped up about.  The only major complaint I have about the film is that it was VERY confusing, I had a great deal of trouble keeping track of who was who and what two parties were fighting and why.  I'm glad I watched the film with someone that knew a fair amount about the King Arthur legends, if I didn't I would have had some serious problems.The acting in the film is quite over-dramatic at times, but pretty good over all.  Most of the actors I'd never even heard of, with exception of Gabriel Byrne, Patrick Stewart and Liam Neeson.  I also recognized Nicol Williamson from some of his other work, but I didn't know his name.  The rest of the cast was pretty good in this film, but like I said there were a few moments where I couldn't help but laugh or roll my eyes at how the scene was over-dramatized.If you're a fan of fantasy films and/or the King Arthur legend, then you may want to check this film out.

They're in huge suits of armor so of course they're going to be slower than we're used to but sometimes they were like in molasses.

Has the writer of this thing even heard of the term 'exposition'? Characters in this film are totally undeveloped and for the most part they strut around in their ridiculous armour, doing things we do not understand the context for. New characters are casually introduced and quickly thrown into action without any real explanation. Identical knights in armour bash each other without the audience knowing who is who or who they should root for. Bizarre ellipses occur regularly, making you wonder what the hell happened in the meantime. Wizards appear and recite spells and summon spirits without any explanation for what they are doing... and so on.

82,dfle3,"Magical, inspiring, exhilarating legend",10,3 July 2008,"A mythical story about the legend of the boy who would become King Arthur and his magical sword ""Excalibur"", this movie is one of my all time favourite British movies. Pretty much everything you ever wanted to know about King Arthur is here-including his back story-who his parents were etc and how he was conceived (actually, you end up having a very good impression of how Arthur was conceived...vigorously, it would seem. For this scene, and scenes of a rather gruesome nature, I would not recommend this movie for youngsters).Even though it's been many years since I've seen this movie, there are a couple of things that have stayed with me about this film: 1) the imagery, and 2) the use of recentish music to dramatise the goings on. As for the imagery, I mean the use of vivid images and stark scenes which are gorgeous to look at. It's the LOOK of the movie which is just so impressive.As for the music-well, this movie introduced me to the music of Carl Orff, specifically, Orff's ""Carmina Burina"". The way that the music and the images combined was just absolutely magnificent-truly rousing...makes you want to get into battle gear, get on your horse (assuming you have one) and to ride to Frankston for a spot of pillaging...get a new pair of ug boots or something.In fact, I loved the music so much I bought a cd of the piece. Doubt if I had the exact same version as used in the movie, but that might be my Holy Grail...to get the exact same recording of the Carmina Burina as used in the movie! Maybe it was just the power of the movie that lifted the music to such great heights. Anyway...Excalibur is an awesome movie that brings out something primal in you and, like the sorcerer Merlin in this movie, leaves you lamenting the passing of an era.",Excalibur

As for the cast; Helen Mirren was ok, Cherie Lunghi was sweet, Nicol Williamson was dreadful, I managed to discern Sir Lancelot, but all the rest, including Arthur, were interchangeable and unidentifiable, spending much of the time clumsily crashing into each other, while wearing the most improbable armour. I did get a clear picture of the round table, which is not saying a lot. There was no explanation for the enigmatic Grail. Was this directed by the same man who made Deliverance and Point Blank ?

84,Rautus,A Classic movie,10,9 January 2008,"There has been quite a few movies based on the Legend of Arthur such has The Sword in the Stone, First Knight, King Arthur, etc. Exalibur is a great adaptation of Arthur legend, the film is also based on the novel La Morte D'Arthur. The acting in this movie is good and the effects are cool for the time. The film shows the life of King Arthur and the legend of the Exalibur and the director John Boorman does a great job showing this.The film sees a battle going on, the leader Uther Pendragon discovers the legendary blade known as Exalibur with the help of the wizard Merlin, with the sword Uther joins an alliance with his enemy. During the party to celebrate Uther falls in love with the wife of the enemy's king and starts another battle begins. Uther asks for Merlin's help to be with her so using the Dragons breath Uther becomes disguised as the king and sleeps with her. The king gets killed in battle so Uther marries her and has a son, Merlin shows up and takes the son off him since Uther made an offer with Merlin. He takes him away and names him Arthur, Uther brings a few of his men to find Merlin so he can get his son again but they get ambushed by people in the woods, injured Uther impales Exalibur into a stone so no one can have it. Years later Arthur is a young man and with his step-father and step-brother they go to the tournament where the winner tries to pull Exlibur from the stone, Arthur misplaces his brothers sword so pulls the sword from the stone. Everyone gathers around and Arthur takes it from the stone again to show them. Merlin then appears and tells Arthur about who he really is and that he was destined to wield Exlibur and become king.

The score from Trevor Jones is superb and the cinematography is fantastic, as is the production design. The cast are good, although Nigel Terry grates as Arthur, this is somewhat of a problem as he is the lead character. Nicol Williamson is excellent as Merlin though and there is also a great performance from a very sexy looking Helen Mirren. Cracking stuff! Also with the recent poor adaptation King Arthur from Jerry Bruckheimer this looks like remaining the best adaptation of the classic tale. The film has an underlying and subtle campness and humour that is noticeable from the cast. It never gets too dark and dreary as some fantasy's like Conan have been known to get. ****",Excalibur
86,roghache,"Dark and murky Camelot rife with sorcery, gore, and sex",1,12 May 2006,"While this retelling of King Arthur's legend remains popular with many, this bloody tale of dark sorcery and sex is definitely not for me. To its credit, this fantasy does somewhat follow Thomas Mallory's Le Morte d'Arthur. However, it seems more concerned with visual imagery and sensationalism than informative story telling. The viewer would do well to brush up on the myths BEFORE seeing this picture to avoid being confused as to the unfolding events.The movie reveals the travels of Arthur's mystical sword, Excalibur. Uther Pendragon, Arthur's father, is given the sword by the magician Merlin. Morgana, Arthur's half sister, witnesses Uther's rape of her mother, Igraine, resulting in Arthur's conception. Years later Arthur, Uther's now adult bastard son, draws the sword out of the stone and becomes the new king, setting up his court at Camelot with his Knights of the Round Table. However, his Queen, Guinevere, engages in an adulterous affair with his trusted knight, Sir Lancelot. Meanwhile, the knights are off on a Quest for the Holy Grail. Arthur has produced an incestuous son with Morgana, who is herself a sorceress and has vowed revenge on Arthur for his father's heinous deeds. This malevolent son, Mordred, arrives on the scene, claiming his father's throne for himself and ultimately causing Arthur's downfall.In terms of the acting, I don't wish to disparage any of the cast, as it's been some years since I saw this film. Nigel Perry portrays King Arthur and Nicol Williamson is the sorcerer, Merlin, whom we see far too much of. Liam Neeson and Patrick Stewart both have minor roles here in their days preceding fame. Admittedly, the music is effectively dramatic with Wagner's operas and O, Fortuna! Also, the shining silver castle and dark greenish armour of the knights are well portrayed. However, not much else good can be said.Obviously, this is really not a very pretty tale, involving as it does rape, incest, lust, adultery, dark sorcery, and brutal battles. Some have complained that other adaptations create a fanciful, glamorized storybook portrait of Camelot, but frankly, that is what I would have preferred...or at least some reasonable middle ground. This rendition goes out of its way to exploit to the highest degree possible all the dark aspects of these myths. It is a movie rife with explicit sex, nudity, vulgarity, and endless, endless gore. Rape scenes by a knight wearing full mail armour are not my idea of entertainment. Furthermore, the atmosphere is constantly dark and murky. Cold, misty castle depictions and fog shrouded battles under a blood red sun are certainly effective images, but this is a Camelot that never sees normal sunlight. These particular Dark Ages are very dark indeed, both figuratively and literally.My main complaint apart from the gloomy darkness, sex, and blood is that there is no real character portrayal. The Arthurian myths are actually far too extensive to be effectively captured in a regular movie. Hence there is little emotional engagement with any of these characters. The main interaction here is between Arthur and Merlin, and Merlin's sorcery never much interests me. Camelot's love triangle seems not very engrossing nor Arthur even a particularly sympathetic character. Even in a fantasy, if the characters fail to capture your interest, it really doesn't matter much what magic or other drama befalls.Admittedly, there are serious time constraints and the movie is intended to focus on Arthur & his sword. However, there are definitely vital parts of the legends missing. Little is revealed of the knights' various chivalrous exploits, no Sir Gawain and the Green Knight or other such derring do. The knights' Quest for the Holy Grail seems detached from any Christian significance, it's all rather pagan. If they weren't going to 'do it up properly', they shouldn't have included it at all. And where is Sir Galahad? I do realize that some of the earlier myths have Sir Percival finding the Grail, but Galahad is the ultimate pure Grail Knight who should have completed this mission. Of course purity seems to be of little concern to this film's producers! No Galahad, thus no reference to his conception when Lancelot is deceived into sleeping with Elaine, believing her to be Guinevere. Many have disparaged First Knight, which admittedly totally deviates from the Arthurian legends and is actually not intended to portray them. That movie keeps the story simple and provides an engrossing character depiction of human strengths & frailties, far more fascinating than Merlin's magic. It boasts a sympathetic Arthur and a compelling love triangle. In short, it depicts a noble Camelot, perhaps less faithful to the myths but vastly preferable to this dark and gory one. Excalibur has no dearth of action, but I personally found it not only unpleasant viewing but actually boring to watch. My husband, who normally revels in medieval battle tales, literally dozed off part way through.",Excalibur
87,mrb1980,"Expansive, Breathtaking Story of King Arthur",9,19 May 2008,"The time around 500 A.D. truly represented the Dark Ages in England. The Romans had left Britannia, and the native Britons were dealing with an invasion of Angles and Saxons from mainland Europe. While the origins of the Arthur legend are obscure, the story is well known. Arthur, Merlin the Magician, Sir Lancelot, and Guinevere are familiar characters to most people, who know the story of the Knights of the Round Table. Arthur is generally thought to be a real person of this era, but no one really knows for sure.Of course, while there's no concrete, verifiable record of Arthur or the other characters in this film, that doesn't matter; director John Boorman has created a movie that is magnificent in its scope, and vividly tells the Arthurian legend in entertaining style. The film pulls no punches in its portrayal of the brutal, difficult time of the late 5th and early 6th centuries. During battles, men didn't hide and shoot weapons at one another from cover, instead they clubbed and stabbed each other to death in hand-to-hand combat, resulting in bloody carnage on a massive scale. Boorman also has included some pretty steamy sex scenes, showing us that life during these times was not all bloodshed and battle.The movie gives us colorful portrayals of Merlin, the sword Excalibur, the Lady in the Lake, and the ascent of the young Arthur. Eventually the Knights of the Round Table fall into disorganization and decay, only to be acquitted on the battlefield by an older Arthur and Lancelot, who find glory one final time. Long but never boring, bloody but realistic, ""Excalibur"" is simply enchanting and enthralling. Try to catch the widescreen versionyou're cheating yourself otherwise.",Excalibur
88,HelenMary,"Aside from the dreadful acting, a superb retelling of Arthurian legend",6,11 July 2015,"Excalibur, as the name suggests, is a retelling of the legend of King Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table. It tells the whole story from Uther Pendragon getting the sword from Merlin and faithfully tells the well-known tale through to the return of the sword from whence it came. It has lots of parallels with the Disney's Sword in the Stone including a Merlin and a fish scene (no songs like ""to and for, to and fro, that's what makes the world go round"") but similar philosophies are mentioned and the morality of the story is not lost.The sets, design, wardrobe and scenery are perfect for the film - historians might disagree. Stunning and reminiscent of the old historical/Biblical epics and I love the way that Wardrobe put a modern and beautiful slant on the clothes, especially the ladies (see Knights Tale for a more up to date version of similar clothing). Many of the stunts were very good, special effects fair for the time and for an early 80s film it tried to be as ""real"" as possible showing some quite graphic (for the time) sex scenes and nudity. The Direction was definitely mature and Boorman clearly had a very vivid image in his mind and this was clearly a labour of love but sadly much of what he tried to do looks naive now (2015)The major - but only - fault with this film, and it's a big one, is the acting. Everyone shouts, over-acts or is reading-from-script- wooden and Merlin can't decide whether he's a comedy schlock-fest of funny voices or a dark and foreboding apparition who's voice sends shivers down the spine. No-one acts sensibly and there's a glut of big names so you'd expect better; Helen Mirren, Gabriel Byrne, Clive Swift, Liam Neeson, Patrick Stewart, Cherie Lunghi to name a few. The acting is so bad it turns a dramatic, sinister, historical (sort of) narrative into laugh out loud comedy but for bad reasons not good ones. A few times during the film I felt I was watching a bad school production on stage and couldn't believe how amateur it seemed. Perhaps Merlin (Nicol Williamson) was supposed to be the ""plucky comic relief"" or perhaps it is just a very dated film, and hammy was what he was asked to do. It did very well for gongs and so clearly was well received at the time. Watching it forty years on, for the first time, however, it hasn't aged well but is still a terrific film in terms of spectacle and if you love untampered retelling of the legendary Arthurian tale you'll love it despite its flaws.",Excalibur
89,RiffRaffMcKinley,"A ""Wow"" Moment",9,24 February 2011,"It took me three tries, but I finally got into John Boorman's 1981 fantasy epic, ""Excalibur."" Now that I'm in, I'm all in. In spite of a rocky start (the result of abrupt pacing, overly dramatic vocal characterization, and general weirdness), ""Excalibur"" emerges one of the most incredible, certainly the most visually impressive cinematic rendering of the Arthurian legend.Somewhat episodic in structure, the film features everything you could want from a regal fantasy film: swords clashing with armor on the battlefield, shimmering magic, good and evil in head-on conflict, and breathtaking sets and costumes. Alex Thomson's rich cinematography is another plus for the film, as are Nicol Williamson as an appropriately mysterious and clever Merlin and also Helen Mirren, used to the exquisite extent of her blossoming abilities as wicked Morgana.Not in the best interests of the film: blending some of Trevor Jones' original score compositions with existing opera selections, which feel too well-known and are not mythological or timeless enough to score a picture like this. Jones should have been allowed to carry the entire soundtrack-- he could have handled it quite easily; this is the ""Dark Crystal"" composer, after all. The most painful of these is a culturally ubiquitous passage from ""Carmina Burana,"" extremely overrated and a bit on the cliché side.The abrupt pacing is also not kind to the movie, with major new plot points being raised in a matter of seconds and, at times, dropped just as quickly. Nigel Terry seems initially overwhelmed as King Arthur, but, like the character, rises to the occasion. Although Cherie Lunghi is an enchanting Guenevere, in fact one of the best in any version of the story.Look also for Patrick Stewart and Liam Neeson as knights. This is before they were quite so famous.Of the John Boorman films I've seen (which includes ""Deliverance"") this is by far the best, in spite of its shortcomings. If only he'd been allowed to direct ""Exorcist II"" with as much narrative cohesion as ""Excalibur"", it would have been a masterpiece comparable to the original.",Excalibur

He has surpassed himself, for here we have his interpretation of Thomas Malory's book, Le Morte d'Arthur. A passing of stories through time, as Excalibur is passed on through heritage. We are given an insight into the English myth that is Merlin, Arthur and the Sword of Legends; Excalibur.We owe, at least, the legend of Merlin to Geoffrey of Monmouth, this Welshman born in 1100, became a Clergyman after studying at Oxford University. Myrddin, the Welsh Wizard, was quickly changed to Merlin as his original name came a little too close to a particular vile French word. Writing three books, that all contained in some form or other, Merlin. This, the second piece, was to bring the Legend of Arthur and Merlin together. Historia Regum Britanniae (The History of the Kings of Britain) was written in 1136, and here is Arthur the Dux Bellorum, the War Leader, as the earliest text would describe him. Geoffrey of Monmouth died in 1154.One of the earliest mentions of Excalibur can be given to the French poet Robert De Boron's verse entitled Merlin, in this poem it tells us of The Sword in the Stone.Many years of Chinese Whispers later, and the rest has become subconscious Legend. Beautifully filmed in the country of Ireland, the scenery is breath taking. It is not just the unknown actors in this movie that make it what it is. This is a movie of behind the scene experience, of the Director, the fantastic work of the Cinematographer, Wardrobe and Set Design, which have truly made Excalibur stand out.Alex Thomson was nominated for both the 1981 British Society of Cinematographers and the 1982 Academy Awards for Excalibur; other works include Legend (1985), The Krays (1990) and Alien3 (1992). Bob Ringwood won the 1982 Saturn Award for Best Costumes, as well as John Boorman winning the 1981 Cannes Film Festival for Best Artistic Contribution. In total, ten nominations and two wins. Casting unknown actors has given Excalibur it's own identity, it is The Sword of Legends that is the Star here. With new faces, that would, in time, find their own niche and blossom into Stardom, being, Gabriel Byrne, Liam Neeson, Patrick Stewart and Nigel Terry, who have all worked very well to bring us an excellent performance. Having Helen Mirren as Morgana and the very well placed Nicol Williamson as the Magical Enigma and Mystic Seer that is Merlin, brings Excalibur to greater heights. With charismatic cunning and devious Wizardry and Witchcraft, they project fear, loathing and respect from the Dark Aged minds that seek their wisdom. Playing their parts in history, as they really do know the outcome of the future of Man and their own inevitable demise. John Boormans own son, credited as Charley and now known as Charlie, plays the young Mordred. Story telling, through the ages of time, has continually changed its format, but the lure of fantasy and escapism has and never will change. This, Excalibur the movie, will be, till the end of time, another part of the History that is Arthur, Merlin and Excalibur. For to partake in watching Excalibur, we all are participating in our own History Lesson, a lesson of brave Knights, Dragons, Wizards, Witches and Legend.This is one lesson that no one should miss.",Excalibur
91,Thrashman88,Superb Film,10,17 February 2004,"This is the kind of film that makes Oscar material, so  I was extremely saddened when I found out it didn't win any (Its sole nomination was for cinematography). As other users have commented, this is probably the best, pre-LORD OF THE RINGS fantasy feature ever. It's the story of King Arthur from his stained conception until his inevitable end. Those of you expecting a typical Hollywood blockbuster, be warned: EXCALIBUR is an artsy film, but one that is truly entertaining. It's a fairy tale for grown ups, as the Sex and Violence are prominent through out the entire movie. The performances are outstanding, especially Nigel Terry's (King Arthur). We watch him transform from a humble squier to being THE king of kings himself! I watched EXCALIBUR when I was 13 years old and I'm glad to say that it holds perfectly well in this age of Computer Generated (CG) special effects. And it also has something that most recent fantasy flicks don't have: a terrific story and screenplay. This is one of those movies to OWN on DVD! 10* out of 10*!",Excalibur
92,antagonist117,"""Excalibur"" is a mess that consistently falls short of its laudable aims",3,6 April 2014,"""Excalibur"" is a cautionary case of overreaching. I refer to the film itself, not to the story it tries to tell. It seems to be an attempt to radically condense the whole Arthurian cycle, as transmitted by the 15th-century knight Sir Thomas Malory, into a single film, but that very long, overstuffed, barely-linear, beautiful mess of a text defies adaptation. By the standards of modern taste its dialogue is too baldly moralistic, its action too repetitive and predictable. It is nevertheless an enduring work because the basic theme of the tale— our desire to create a perfect society despite our irrepressible personal imperfections—and the romance and magic of the setting are still appealing. ""Excalibur"" understands the source text on more than a surface level, and clearly tries to engage with it in an artful way, but it is undone by a lack of conceptual grounding and an execution that is as poor as it is audacious.In trying, haltingly, to center the story on the famous sword, the movie preferences an inanimate object, no more than a McGuffin really, over the human characters. The first act provides characterizations of Uther, Arthur, Lancelot, and others only by proxy, through the tenor of their shouting about the sword and the way they behold it as it glows in an oversaturated green aura. The acting is far below the standards that some of the stars, including Gabriel Byrne, Liam Neeson, and Patrick Stewart, would later set for themselves, which suggests that their spastic line deliveries are intentional. Nicol Williamson as Merlin is the worst offender, even more comically absurd than John Cleese's ""Tim"" in Monty Python's comparatively sophisticated riff on the legend. The technique of overacting can work to create a sense of heightened reality, but in this case it comes off as a silly affectation. Only Helen Mirren, as Arthur's malevolent sister, turns in a controlled performance of a quality generally recognized as good. As the movie progresses, its focus remains more or less on the sword, which is shoehorned into the romances between Lancelot and Guinevere and Guinevere and Arthur in a way that owes little to the medieval texts. Its trumped-up significance overshadows their scenes without adding to them; by devoting vague words to the subject of Excalibur, opportunities are missed to delve more deeply into the socioreligious significance of Arthur's kingdom and the inner worlds of the people who populate it.The sword, however, has no bearing on the Holy Grail portion of the film, which therefore feels tangential and ultimately irrelevant despite being the most creatively-staged episode in the production. Here the script engages with the ancient legend of the impotent king whose land is barren. The reference and some of the imagery used to underline is is appreciated, but it is little more than a reference, neither scrutinized for its significance nor linked to the rest of the loose script. The macabre trippiness of this part of the Malory text is on vivid display through dream sequences and a grotesque hanging tree. Here if nowhere else in the movie, the special effects that are superimposed in bright, artificial colors on top of washed out sets and landscapes seem appropriate instead of unnecessary and frankly shoddy.""Excalibur"" is a film for Arthur aficionados who are willing to look past its awkwardness, excesses, and digressions to appreciate its good intentions and kernels of good ideas.",Excalibur

A great representation of one of the greatest legends ever told. The myth of King Arthur brought to the screen. Uthur Pendragon is given the mystical sword Excalibur by Merlyn. At his death Uthur buries the sword into a stone, and the next man that can pull it out will be King of England. Years later Arthur, Uthur's bastard son draws Excalibur and becomes king. Arthur's evil half-sister Morgana sires a son with him, who may prove his downfall. This film is brought is brought to us by great British thespians and I say that because it shows. It's great work, I loved it. The main lead Nigel Terry who plays Arthur when we first see him in Camelot I immediately thought to myself yep that's a perfect choice for King Arthur. Same when I saw Nicholas Clay as Sir Lancelot and just about everyone cast int this picture. The pacing of this movie was great as well. The story movies along in a brisk pace and tells its story in a great amount of time, it's not too long or two short it feels just right. The director John Boorman I feel wanted to tell the whole tale of those wielded Excalibur and make a faithful interpretation of the myth of King Arthur.

The sets were fantastic and WHAT a cast! I've seen a lot of films that involve knights on horseback and guys fighting each other with swords dressed in armor but this is the only one with hugely over the top acting and way too out of this world grossly exaggerated dialog. Merlin, played by Nichol Williamson is incredible in this and put in one hell of a performance, much to the surprise of the directors who, as rumor had it, wanted to recast him!! Patrick Stewart puts that booming voice of his to good use too on more than one occasion!! This is by far the best film made in Ireland in the '80s. It also covered the story of King Arthur better than any other film before or since.",Excalibur
95,bbhlthph,Thru' mists of time,9,17 July 2010,"Most film directors spend available time watching well regarded films made by other directors; both learning from them and, equally valuable, considering how they could have been improved. Often the director concerned develops a strong urge to re-make a film which he or she feels could have been created much more effectively. Conversely established studios may reward in-house directors for exceptionally financially successful films by providing full support to make any film of the director's choice. In this way James Cameron's success with Titanic gave him the opportunity to create Avatar, and Peter Jackson, after directing the Lord of the Rings trilogy, became able to create the 2005 version of King Kong. John Boorman had long wanted to make his own film of Tolkien's Lord of the Rings, but was beaten to the post by Ralph Bakshi's 1978 animated film - now overshadowed by Peter Jackson's award winning trilogy but still a remarkable film which has just earned a new lease of life as a Blueray release. Film enthusiasts must be grateful that Boorman sought the opportunity to film the Arthurian legends instead. Although never accurately dated, these relate to the period immediately following the withdrawal of Roman forces from Britain in the first half of the fifth century. In AD 379 Christianity had became the official Roman religion and these legends have it that Arthur battled to preserve both Christianity and Roman civilization from Barbarian invaders. Although his name is found in some Roman records, there is no record of his exact status, or even any convincing proof that he ever lived. Despite prolific legends, other written records all date from a much later period so historians still put them in the unproven category. Clearly all the written accounts of battles between armies of knights in the type of shining armour only developed in the twelfth century must date from this period or later and, if not fictional, can only be reporting verbal traditions. This situation is similar to that with Troy, which, until archaeologists finally unearthed the remains of the city, was long regarded as a legend to be found only in the pages of Homer's Illiad. There have been many attempts to unearth remains proving the Arthurian legends in this way, but to date nothing totally convincing has been found. Many feel that such a mass of detailed stories is unlikely to have arisen without any foundation, but as with Troy this would not confirm the individual tales which have been passed down for so many centuries. We may never know whether Achilles or Hector really existed but even if this is one day proved we will still not accept the legends linking them to the immortals of Mount Olympus. Similarly with Arthur, archaeological discoveries confirming his participation in some of his legendary battles would not even prove that he was a legitimately crowned monarch, let alone support the stories of magical interventions on his behalf by Merlin. .Historically, Arthur is a Celtic hero and these legends appear to have emanated from the Celtic refuges in Cornwall, Wales and Brittany. This might point to a slightly later historical period when the Celts had been driven far to the west by the invading Saxons. But the legends speak of Arthur's conquests, at their peak, extending over most of Britain and parts of both France and Scandinavia so it is equally easy to understand why oral legends of past greatness would have become increasingly important a few centuries later when his people had been forced into a smaller and less hospitable area. Early written records come mainly from Wales where Geoffrey of Monmouth incorporated many of the legends into a history of the Celtic kings. These and other similar works were used by Sir Thomas Malory to create his major work -:""Le Morte d'Arthur"", printed by Caxton in 1485. Prepared as eight books covering the entire life of Arthur, this was perhaps the most important work he printed. An excellent summary of the contents of each book can be found on line in Wikipedia. Four hundred years later Tennyson, using considerable poetic licence, converted them into the soaring blank verse of ""Idylls of the King"" which so naturally complemented Victorian concepts of Christian morality. John Boorman clearly knew and loved the works of both Malory and Tennyson. Perhaps more important this was also true of his scriptwriter Rosco Pallenberg. For them, history was uncertain, this was to be the film of a legend; and I believe they produced the most atmospheric film of legends almost lost in the mists of time ever to have been created, a film which deserves a place in any list of the hundred best films.But both critics and the public have been split on this. This is one of the films that is either loved or hated. The problem I think was that many who saw it were expecting a fictional reconstruction of the life of the great King Arthur. This could make a good film but it should be called King Arthur, not Excalibur; and it was not Boorman's film. He did what he set out to do incredibly brilliantly and I find it hard to criticise his great work. However, disappointed with its reception, he is now in the process of filming it again with an IMDb expected release date of 2012. Boorman is a director capable of creating an even more outstanding film, but because re-makes have a history of so often falling short of the original I am writing these comments now to urge fellow film lovers to buy the DVD of the existing film before it is withdrawn and becomes a very elusive masterpiece to track down. I rate it at a rare but well deserved nine stars.",Excalibur
96,coop-16,"Operatic,mythic, retelling of Arthurian legend.",10,10 May 1999,"At different times in his illustrious career, John Boorman has announced that his intention to make film versions of both The Lord Of The Rings, and  Wagners ""Ring"" cycle.Like Scorsese's plans to do film biographies of Gershwin and Robert Johnson, or Coppola's plans to make versions of Faust and Pinocchio, these grandiose projects have come to nothing. Fortunately, in Excalibur, we have something that comes close..VERY close. Boorman retells the Arthur legend in a way that evokes both the mythic power of Tolkien and the operatic splendor of Wagner.. ( Indeed, the sound track makes frequent use of Wagner.)Some have criticized Boorman for making the story of King Arthur too sexy and violent. Well, in their original , unexpurgated form, the Arthurian legends were just that. Boorman also looks at the Druidic and pagan roots of the arthur story, ("" The Land is the King.""), and examines the inner conflict between Paganism and Christianity that gave the myth its original power. A great film, and one of my personal favorites. I have not seen Robert Bresson's version of the Arthur myth, Lancelot Du Lac, but I suspect that it may be the only other one by a major film-maker that comes close to the eerie, mythic, glorious heart of Arthurian legend.",Excalibur

Visually it owes something to Monty Python's spoof / homage The Holy Grail, and it gets a lot of its impact from the soundtrack of Wagner and Carl Orff, but the poetic nobility with which Boorman infuses the film is his own and in that respect I can think of no other - on any subject - to match it.Yes it is of its time in showing the influence of 60s hippie fallout; yes you could do with a few more extras in the battle scenes; yes it was a mistake for Boorman to cast his daughter Katrine in it (a surprising role, too, for a father to cast his daughter in!). But it succeeds in striking the true, archetypal note of mythic grandeur; and when you do that you make people feel that life has meaning, and that they are more than just their everyday selves. I feel sorry for anyone who doesn't feel uplifted by the ending of this.The bottom line is that it will never be bettered, least of all now when British films seem to have given up all ambition other than social commentary and - if we're lucky - a few laughs.",Excalibur
100,skallisjr,Vivid Imagery,9,3 May 2005,"As with some previous reviewers, I was fascinated with the Arthurian myth long before the picture came out. I knew the Mallory Morte d'Arthur cold, and looked forward to seeing the film. I did so in the theater when it first was released.The pictorial composition is extraordinary. One could freeze-frame the film at any point and have a really good image, suitable for framing.Spoilers follow: Nobody before me mentioned that the Sword in the Stone was *not* Excalibur. In Mallory's original story, Arthur got Excalibur later from the Lady in the Lake.The film had to wrestle with complex issues, and got some wrong. The worst was the Grail Quest. The Grail Quest story is very spiritual, and Galahad never brought the Holy Grail to Camelot, in Mallory, nor did anyone else. This is the weakest part of the film.Margawse, not Morgana, was the woman who bore Mordred, according to legend. She was Arthur's aunt, for those interested in the incest aspect.However, Boorman did an interesting thing with Mordred's armor. It wasn't made of gold; it was bronze. The imagery on it was frankly Pagan, specifically, Graeco-Roman. This focused attention on the struggle between the waning influence of the older religions and the advent of Christianity in Britain, as alluded to in the film. (Also, it symbolizes Bronze Age to Iron Age.) Whatever else, John Boorman strove mightily to follow Mallory's opus, though he missed on some counts. Well worth a look.",Excalibur
101,budmassey,The English language's greatest legend in its best retelling.,10,23 April 2001,"Sir Thomas Malory is thought to have written Le Morte Darthur (original spelling), a series of books about the adventures of a Saxon king named Arthur who had lived a thousand years before Malory, in the fifteenth century while he was in prison. A monumental work originally cast in Middle English, LMD was rewritten and repackaged for centuries in both English and French. A movie that recounted Malory's work in its entirety would be impossible, so any cinematic version must work, as does Excalibur, from a hugely condensed story, which accounts for the many discrepancies between this story and the original. But since Arthur is perhaps the greatest legend of all time, it deserves a reverent treatment on film. Boorman's version, Excalibur, not only affords the masterpiece the respect that is its due, but imbues it with grandeur and awe, and, owing in no small part to a magnificent assembly of Britsh actors whose brilliance may not be easily accessible to the average American viewer, a freshness of character that would not emerge as a literary paradigm until centuries after the original work. The legend of Arthur arose from a millennium of chaos we know as The Dark Ages, some 1500 years ago. In the ages since, the story of the king who united a nation has been told and retold in countless variations. Even the great Robert Redford film The Natural is based on Bernard Malamud's retelling of the Arthurian myth. Lush and lavish cinematography, breathtaking costumes, and theatrical performances make this retelling quite simply the best on film. This time out, we have Gabriel Byrne, Nigel Terry, whom you might remember from The Lion in Winter, the incomparable Helen Mirren as Morgana (aka Morgan LeFave), and a towering performance by Nicol Williamson as Merlin. Also look for buried treasure in the form of cameos by Patrick Stewart, Liam Neeson and even members of director John Boorman's familyAn absolute sensual delight, that succeeds on more levels than most American movies even address. This story doesn't rehash the classic themes of literature, it invented them. Little since then has come close, and this film is a worthy showplace for what may be the greatest story ever told!

Excalibur is the finest movie about King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table I've seen since Monty Python's version.Excalibur seems to be a theatre performance brought to the silver screen. The direction always focuses on the actors, the lines and sets are larger-than-life. The story closely follows Thomas Malory's original classic from the 15th century, making this a rather Shakespearean movie.Visually we get ridiculous amounts of plate armor, huge castle corridors, ludicrously pompous setpieces and costumes, artistic nudity (male and female) and lots of green lighting. This is a movie with no realism in the mix. This is an epic tale of mythic events and characters, told in a mythic manner, as if a child's imagination was conjured up to the world to see. Sadly, there are no dragons, but the witches and magic swords make up for it.There is much in the way of hubris, betrayal and tragedy.

Nigel Terry and Nicol Williamson are excellent as Arthur and Merlin, although somewhat melodramatic and larger than life, but then again those are the roles they were meant to play. The scenery is beautiful and the photography flawless. What really sets Excaliber apart from others before it are the fight scenes. Knights in armor are slow moving men in heavy metal skins lifting heavy metal objects in an attempt to hit the other fellow before they are themselves hit. There are no swashbuckling moves, no feints or finesse to the battles. These are bloody, brutal fights that ring true in the mind of the audience.

The heyday of classic fantasy fiction films, for good or for evil.Considering the time period, and the lack of effort Hollywood put into fantasy films back then, Excalibur is really pretty good.The production values are surprisingly high for the genre. They put a lot of effort into set designs, and put quite a bit of thought into the depictions of Dark Ages medieval warfare. The plate armor is a bit too fancy, but at least they didn't build spotless castle replicas, the construction is as shoddy as it must have been back then.The script holds water as well, at least until the last 1/3rd of the film (the scripting concerning the Holy Grail quest is completely ridiculous). And yeah, the Arthur-Guenevere-Lancelot triangle isn't given the best treatment, but again, at least they tried (more than what would be expected).The real plus in this film is Nicol Williamson's portrayal of Merlin. He has the best lines, well-delivered, and really sells the idea of a half-mad wizard. They also don't overplay the magic, there's no lightning bolts out of the fingers here.

You'll be surprised by performances from Patrick Stewart, Liam Neeson and Gabriel Byrne, in addition to the stellar English actors listed above. Mirren is particularly efficient in her role as Arthur's half-sister Morgana; if you saw her in Caligula, she's just as good here. Based on the Mallory play, the film traces the events preceding Arthur's life, how he came to the throne and the strange events we all know about during his reign. For those who do not know the Mallory play, the new story lines will invigorate you. What stands out the most in this film? The sets are fantastic, especially the actual Round Table.

If you're tired of computer generated monsters, trolls or light swords, look no further than this. As Arthur puts it, ""We'll use the old ways.""Excalibur is a dense, bombastic, aural, noble and spectacular telling of the Arthurian legend. So what if it's not exactly in line with accepted texts? I can't quite hold too much against the script since Arthur may never have existed to begin with. To put it short, I love this film. It's a fantastic companion piece to the Disney Sword in the Stone telling - itself one of my favorite all-time films. There are those who would laugh at the effort here of Boorman and his massive cast, but Excalibur has proved exceptionally influential. Coppola's Dracula production owes more than wink to the style and execution to this film. For good reason. The home spun quality, practical effects and dense physical drama are a prize in the sea of computer fakery these days. There's some magic far beyond Merlin's hand that you will never forget. When ""Oh Fortuna"" booms away as Arthur is showered by cherry blossoms, you're ready to grab the chain mail and ride. A good number of the players in this film went on to bigger and better things. But there was hardly a star during the production. There's no Oscar winning special effects and the film is riddled with rough edges, particularly the extremely poor ADR sync, it's nonetheless hard to fault the overall spectacle. There's a genuinely epic tale told with the care of a handmade sword to command your attention from beginning to end.

In fact it has too much material and i would say the first part when Gabriel Byrne was king should of just been cut out and just started with Arthur pulling the sword from the stone. Some parts of the story are basically skipped over like the knights of the round table, most likely because it was a time of peace then and couldn't wait to get to the fighting. Something else that didn't work was having King Arthur look like such a wimp when you first see him and after getting the sword all of a sudden become a great fighter.

Then he goes out in the forest all the time, she's a wee bit sad, and everyone gets suspicious.  He defends her and wins, then goes out again; she goes after him, in their joy at seeing each other they can't control themselves, etc. etc.  ALso, it was unneccessary to give Arthur an Irsih-Scottish brogue.  The nudity is overdone; whenever Lancelot's in the forest, he takes off all that heavy armor (and absolutley everything under it, too), and something always makes him jump around so we can all see his bare fanny.  No real reason for it, wouldn't you agree?  That said, the rest of the movie was quite good.  Though the legends are rearranged, it doesn't detract from it at all, because it's well-acted and directed.  Nicol Williamson plays Merlin with a fiery intensity and just the right mixture of wisdom and madness.  Helen Mirren is also good (and very attractvie!) as Morgana.  In fact, there's not really a bad acting job, and it's also fun to see Gabriel Byrne, Liam Neeson and Patrick Stewart in early roles as others noted.  I thought the editing was imaginitive; I'm not really an expert on stuff like that, it's just my opinion.  ALso, the music was good.  The film is lavish but in a quiet way; the wedding of Arthur and Guenivere is very striking and sticks out.  Very good aside from those mentioned flaws; I do recommend it.",Excalibur

115,The-Last-Prydonian,Self indulgent with a disjointed narrative but has flashes brilliance,5,1 September 2009,"Over the years there have countless versions or of the legend of King Arthur and the stories that revolve around the mythical kingdom of Camalot. Too many to count and only just last year the BBC had produced a television series that retells the youth of Arthurs sage court adviser, Merlin. Taking many liberties with the folklore surrounding the wizard as well as Arthur himself as well as several other characters.But 'Excalibur', brought to the screen by British director John Boorman is arguably the closest adaptation to the King Arthur mythos. Boorman, the man responsible for a somewhat diverse range of movies that include the critically acclaimed ""Deliverance"" as well as ""Beyond Rangoon'""and the semi-autobiographical ""Hope and Glory"" delved in to the pages of author Thomas Mallory's ""Le Morte d'Arthur"", using it as his primary source material. As a result 'Excalibur' is a ponderous, laborious motion picture which far from being suitable for a family audience is very much adult in nature. Delving in the very roots of Arthur's origins it opens with the details that led to his birth. Proceeded by the boy's journey from young squire, right up to him being King and the formation of the Knights of the round table. As well as the eventual collapse of the Kingdom of Camalot and Arthurs demise at the hands of his treacherous son Mordred. And to do so means their are some fairly graphic scenes of a sexual nature and brutal violence involving well choreographed battle sequences. The fact that the story involves an incestuous tryst which forms an important basis for the plot only further justifies It's unsuitability for younger viewers. With a cast of well known and not so well known British/Irish thespians which include Nigel Terry, Helen Mirren, Nicol Willaimson, Cheri Lunghi, Patrick Stewart and Liam Neeson. It certainly had and still has high credentials. Terry being a wonderful and inspired piece of casting he manages to effortlessly portray the good King from being a spirited, foolhardy and naive squire to the noble, wise and just ruler of Camalot, bridging the transition brilliantly. As the wise yet manipulative and to an extent morally dubious Merlin, Nicol Williamson is wonderfully twitchy and offers a thoughtful, dark side to the eccentric magician. While the radiant Cheri Lunghi brings beauty, grace and class to the role of Arthurs wife and Queen Guinevere. A woman torn between her duty to her husband and King and her love for Arthur's closest friend and ally, Lancealot. Here played with passionate, conflicted agony by Nicholas Clay as well as a serene nobility. The man in no uncertain terms partially responsible as is Guineverere for the downfall of Camalot and the Knights of the Round Table. While final praise must be awarded to Helen Mirren who plays Arthurs vengeful, ambitious half sister Morgaine(spelled Morgana here). Embewing the vengeful seductress with wily cunning, secreted ambition and notable elegance.But while much praise can be heaped upon the film It's performances cannot rescue It from many of the glaring faults It suffers from. Boorman's habit for allowing his direction to be overly theatrical at times, particularly in the closing moments of the movie and during Arthur's final confrontation with his evil son Mordred. Here played relatively briefly by former 'Robin of Sherwood' actor Robert Addie in a role not a million miles unlike that of Sir Guy De Guisborne. There is also Boorman's habit of leaping during the narrative from one section of the movie's story to the next, disallowing any gradual transition in the thread of the story and as a result if feels somewhat disjointed. And while the films looks visually impressive and sumptuous Boorman let's the movies story be buried in too much narrative symbolism when the tale concerns Itself with the Knights quest to find the Holy Grail which will in an attempt to restore and ailing King Arthur to full health. Especially in the scenes which revolve around Sir Perceval (Paul Geoffrey), thus resulting in a confusing and muddled narrative. This means that Boorman is decidedly at his most pretentious and make's me wonder if there were scenes in Thomas Mallory's novel which were plain and simply un-film-able. Consequently meaning that they could not be satisfactorily brought to life on screen.As for the acting style in the movie, I personally adore It although It's declamatory style which somewhat similarly used by Shakespeiran actors may not sit well with certain viewers and one or two of the performances are decidedly over the top and involve a fair bit of gnashing of teeth which made me balk. So Boorman's 1981 effort while beautifully realised visually and conceptually as well as for the most part being expertly acted is a somewhat shallow affair, partially a result with It's at times nonsensical script and self indulgent direction. A shame as there was potentially a great film in there somewhere although given some of the complications in the source material and telling the tale. It may have been wiser to not have bothered attempting to bring Thomas Mallory's novel to the big screen. It's not an awful picture and is just about adequately watchable. But with it's stunning yet pretentious imagery which clog up the narrative amongst another failings It can be nothing more than a moderate distraction.",Excalibur
116,Marx_Bros_Fan86,Visually spectacular adaptation of the Arthur legend,7,10 February 2009,"John Boorman created a new world with his adaptation of the King Arthur Legend, Excalibur. He takes us back to a 6th century England with swords, armor, magic and chivalry, with lush forests and gold castles. The production design is up to par with the best movies of the time period. It is nice to see a film that can create such an engrossing atmosphere without the use of CGI. To paraphrase Roger Ebert, the film's visual beauty makes up for its other flaws.Unfortunately this film has its share of bad actors and terrible dubbing. Even Shakespearean actors like Patrick Stewart overact, although it's nice to see him in a role other than Captain Picard. I am not sure if Nigel Terry is actually doing the voice of King Arthur; if he is than all of his lines must have been dubbed in post production. The bad dubbing is fairly distracting and can take you right out of the film. Another significant problem is how condensed the film is. The plot does not have a natural, logical flow, and it feels more like a collection of poorly developed short stories. That might be because the Arthur legends essentially are a collection of short stories, but I feel the movie would have been better if they had just chosen one short story and stuck with it. The film started with Uther Pendragon conceiving Arthur with the help of Merlin's magic, which was a natural place to start, but then it jumps to Arthur pulling the sword from the stone, Arthur becoming king, Lancelot having an affair with Gwenevere, Morgana LeFay killing Merlin, and finally the search for the Holy Grail and the battle with Mordred. The plot progression feels arbitrary and we don't really understand why the characters act the way they do, we just know that is how it happened in the original story. It really helps to have some knowledge of the Arthur legend or else this movie could be confusing. They really could have made a trilogy out of all these stories, but I guess Boorman did not know if he would get a contract for sequels so he decided to make one epic movie.Aside from the visual aspects, the other great strengths of Excalibur are Nicol Williamson and Helen Mirren. Williamson plays a wonderful, multi-faceted Merlin. He can be very sinister, yet he is the funniest character in the movie. Helen Mirren plays Morgana LeFay, Arthur's half-sister and the mother of his child Mordred. Morgana is Merlin's rival, a wretched sorceress bent on getting revenge on Merlin and Arthur, because Merlin cast a spell on her mother which made her think Pendragon was her real husband. Arthur was conceived through this act of deceit on Merlin's part. Mirren has great chemistry with Williamson. Supposedly they had had an affair during a play or movie in the past and could not stand each other anymore, and both actors tried to convince Boorman to fire the other! These actors really carry the movie.Excalibur is a fun romp with great visuals and two outstanding actors. It is the best adaptation of the Arthur legend that I have seen, much better than First Knight. I hope one day someone makes a trilogy out of the Arthur legend, it could be great fun!",Excalibur
117,FlorisV,"Graphic, enchanting, fascinating",8,25 May 2009,"The first half of this film is definitely not it's finest hour. Too much chaos, overacting, shouting around, a rape scene that unintentionally comes across as ridiculous...but stick with it and you'll find one of the most fascinating films on the Arthurian legend I know.The focus lies a lot on mysticism and religion. The ""pagan"" sorcerer Merlin slowly loses his power as his ways become forgotten, while the weight is shifted towards Christianity later on in the film. But Merlin is not evil and the most fascinating scenes are the ones in which he and Morgana use their mysterious powers.Graphically, the film is amazing, though at times exaggerated with all the shiny armors and swords. There are some truly stunning and sometimes equally shocking scenes that speak volumes without a word. Other than most films in this genre which can be horribly stiff in their dialog, this film comes alive with it's likable characters and it's imaginative scenery. Arthur, Percival and Lancelot are flawed but sympathetic, Merlin and Morgana are very intriguing.There are no bad actors in this film and many became famous later on. The direction is sometimes at fault not finding the right balance between intensity and subtlety.Forgive the film for it's flaws and you will be rewarded with a mesmerizing experience if you're open to it.",Excalibur
118,sbox,Arthurian Legend Done Good Service,8,15 January 1999,"Medieval England was no fun.  But I think that's obvious.  This film does a good job at portraying the Arthurian Legend for all it was.  Simply, the best great hope for civilization during the dark times.  One is reminded that the greeks didn't hold the patent on tragedy.Moreover, Excalibur tells the tale with film, not the printed word.  This is an exercise made all the more difficult.  Example given;  how many greek tragedies have succeeded on the big screen?  I think you get the point.  I suppose then that Excalibur has filled a nice niche.This film does work.  The story is lucid, recognizable, stunning, and disturbing all at once.  Despite the high mileage on the Arthurian legend, the movie makes it all seem so fresh.  The audience is drawn to Arthur, then to Lancelot, then back to Arthur, then back to Lancelot, etc.  We feel we are Percival, searching and hoping for the one thing that can restore Camelot.Some of the acting in this movies is first rate.  Patrick Stewart and Liam Neeson deliver performances which evidence their extraordinary skill. However, it is without a doubt that Nicol Williamson steals the show as a believable and sometimes bumbling Merlin.All in all, if you choose to skip this film, you are cheating only yourself.",Excalibur

120,Mike Astill,Excellent battle scenes. Well worth seeing.,7,13 September 2001,"John Boorman's semi-adaptation of La Morte D'Arthur may come as something of a surprise, albeit a pleasant one, as the usually glamorised and fanciful tale is furnished in grimly realistic fashion. The armour, weapons and castles all look very authentic, and indeed it is in the battle sequences that the film excels, especially due to the stirring music selected to accompany each pivotal scene. Purists will doubtless find plenty to frown and tut' about, but doing justice to the Arthurian legends in film is a monumental task and Boorman delivers a true classic. Acting is fine, although dialogue is shouted more than spoke, and delivered with all the subtlety of a flanged mace.  Nicol Williamson stands out in particular as the creepy Merlin, but it's fun to see Helen Mirren, Patrick Stewart and Liam Neeson paving their ways to future stardom. Of course, if the film has any reputation at all it is with its vicious battle scenes, which are still gory even today. They are, it has to be said, very welcome, because without the depictions of desperate, hand-to-hand battle, you might start comparing it with First Knight  which would be something close to sacrilege. My older DVD copy looks fine but sounds a bit tinny, so it's with some annoyance I see there's a special edition out now, which presumably has had the full restoration work done on it. If you haven't seen Excalibur but have an interest in the subject (and hated First Knight), you should certainly give it a try.",Excalibur
121,rondine,bad acting spoils it all!,3,29 August 2001,"I have to tell you this movie has some of the worst, cheesiest acting I've ever seen. Costumes are good, sets are beautiful, I could care less if all equipment is correct for the time period. The stealing of music from Wagner's ""Tristan und Isolde"" is a nice touch (also another tragic love story where the hero & heroine die) and the Orff's ""Carmina Burana"" (which has been overused nowadays to the EXTREME!) is appropriate.What's missing? good acting. From anyone. Even Nicol Williamson is depressingly crappy. And why? this is a cast that should be first rate... Helen Mirren, Nigel Terry, Nicol, a young Liam Neeson. But it sucks. And Cherie Lunghi... who would sacrifice for this woman? she's not even close to being as beautiful as Helen Mirren! (Odd that Cherie should also have a small part in The Misson w/Bobby DeNiro as the woman that comes between him & his brother.) The scene where Arthur is knighted is a prime example. The person that knights him has some of the WORST acting I've ever been privileged to see. He's as hammy as it gets.so... I don't believe this movie is the ""Camelot"" version of the Arthur tale.

122,Bry-2,Zehr gut!,7,12 December 2002,"Despite the chromed armour plate, and the fact that plate armour itself is about 500 years too late for true Arthurian-era, this is the best retelling of the Arthur saga ever, or at least of the Mallory-ized version, with some obvious influence from Alfred, Lord Tennyson.  The Wagner and Orff in the sound track is some of the best use of pre-existent classical music since Kubrick's 2001.  The battle scenes are not for the faint of heart. 
Boorman's settings are beautiful, intimidating, dark and musty -- whatever is required!  The perfomrances are, by and large, excellent, with Nicol Williamson's Merlyn fey and sardonic, as you might expect of a person so intellectually and culturally superior to those he must ""serve.""

The hope of mankind seems to rest with these gallant ""Knights of the Round Table"" and only a director of the calibre of Boorman could capture the imagination the way he has in this film. Merlin and Arthur are powerfully portrayed. The myths are ""believable."" The music is superlative. This movie boasts one of the finest endings of any movie I have ever seen. To Wagnerian strains ""Excalibur"" is returned to ""The Lady of the Lake."" Nowhere have I found a film that sends shivers up and down my spine as this particular scene does at the end. The whole movie is worth watching just for that one final scene. The ""Valhalla""-like ending, with Arthur carried off by the ""Valkyries"" after a bloody battle, resounds again to Wagner with lightning bolt effect. What a movie! Makes one proud to be English! It must be said, however, that although there is no Viking burning of the funeral pyre in the ""bloody"" sunset scene at the end when Arthur is transported off to realms unknown, I think Boorman has successfully discredited the Celtic ""river dancing"" legend and instead superseded it with the Siegfried legend offering us the Germanic interpretation of the founding of the English race flavored by the Aryan strains of Wagner and the Germanic foundation of the English people, language and culture.",Excalibur

One can't watch Excalibur without hearing lines from Monty: 'just a flesh wound...stop that music!...back foul temptress!' There is virtually nothing new in this version of the story, and the fact that the characters seem instructed to only recite their few lines, making them one-dimensional pawns to the ""legendary"" predictable plot is the killer. Only the humorous character of Merlin, perhaps an ode to Monty Python (he's like John delancie's 'Q' in Star Trek) is interesting, thoughtful, and played with wonderful vitality by Nicol Williamson (who was awesome as Sherlock Holmes in ""7 % solution"").Compare 2 movies from 1965: the Batman movie with Adam West and the James Bond ""Thunderball"": very similiar movies, both very ridiculous except ""Batman"" was (& still is) suppose to be funny, the latter is suppose to be serious and becomes embarrassing.

That works out fine for me as it is good, damn good.If you usually go for these hardcore mid evil fantasy stories of sword and sorcery like I do, you will get a lot out of this. It's, epic, full of sword fights and magic and imaginative storytelling. What truly makes this one work so well is how it is told, how it follows the character of Arthur from a baby till an old man. It shows the reign over his kingdom, all the downfalls, and all the betrayals. dark when it needs to be, romantic when it needs to be.

Orson Welles loved Shakespeare but nothing was sacred to him when adapting the plays to films. He cut out ruthlessly as the medium demanded. The first two Potter movies were slavish in their faithfulness, but things got interesting when they made bigger changes in the last two. A lot of people who complain, ""They changed the book!"" make me roll my eyes. This is a movie, and usually the case is the filmmakers were not ballsy enough to change even more things, try a daringly different approach. In the same vein, Excalibur is my favorite version of the Arthurian legend, mixing a heady brew of historically researched details, bloodiness, dramatic license and over-the-top acting to create a rollicking good story that describes, in film terms, the same grand arc of the original epic.

Boorman has an excelent eye for how to make art-work of a movie and Excalibur is no exception. He has put together some not-so-famous actors, and yet he managed to make them more trustworthy than most of the more famous actors. It is just sad that it doesn't seem to be Boorman who will be making the saga ""Lord of the Rings"" into an epic movie.

It's visually stunning, with an undeniably grandiose and epic quality, no doubt fueled by the superb performances.In fact, this is among the finest fantasy adventures created, rubbing shoulders with the likes of Conan the Barbarian and the Lord of the Rings (which was ironically what John Boorman initially intended to make). Some early and even a few debut performances grace the film, such as Liam Neeson, Gabriel Byrne, and Helen Mirren.Some have argued that the full plate armor donned by the knights is not ""historically accurate."" Seeing as King Arthur is a legendary and/or mythical figure who may not have existed at all, this is not a terribly valid criticism. Furthermore, much of the myth surrounding King Arthur that many are familiar with comes from a work published in 1485 (Thomas Mallory's Le Mort D'Arthur), a time when armor design was at its zenith and plate armor was common amongst those who could afford it, i.e. knights and other nobility.I really don't have much criticism. I was not in the least bothered by the depiction of Arthur and his knights in full plate armor when engaged in battle. But it was more than a bit silly to see everything else from feasting to sex also portrayed in full armor. Such small issues did not detract from the splendor of the film. It is passionate, violent, with a mystical aura that enhanced the settings. Highly recommended.",Excalibur
130,Zoopansick,EXCalibur EXCellent and of a high CALIBUR!,7,14 July 2003,"Puns not withstanding this is a great fantasy movie.  In general most fantasy films are done with low budgets and are usually boring and tedious sword and sandal adventures.  Excalibur however, draws from it's source material extremely well to create both and engaging, visually impressive, and fairly accurate retelling of the timeless story.  Other Arthur adaptations fail at presenting the story itself and often focus on the love triangle, or the sword and the stone part.  Here both parts of the story are included but there is so much more!  The magical element is there but it exists within a believable medieval setting.  I think one of the problems I had with First Knight was that it left out the fantasy all together and was bogged down with a boring love story.  Here the love story is portrayed but so is Merlin and the mythical elements with Morgan and the sword, Excalibur itself.I really liked the visuals in the film.  The fights seem very real but the foggy atmosphere lets the audience know that the film is fantasy.  Mordrid is especially diabolical and the audience just has to hate him.  No one likes an arrogant punk kid with an annoying laugh.  The story evolves nicely as we see both the rise and fall of Arthur.  It's really a great movie, especially if you are looking for a fantasy movie and have already seen Lord of the Rings multiple times.  Check this one out, it may not have the special effects, but the story and fight scenes make up for it.

Short of the televised version of the ""feminist"" take on the Arthurian legend, ""Excalibur"" was, in its time, a ""revelation"" of sorts.

Arthur, aged and exhausted, within the sacred circle of Stonehenge, calls on Merlin, who then circumambulates the veiled bedchamber of Morgaine, his nemesis, and, chanting, undoes her foul outrages in a fog of impotence. Finally, as in ""The Mists of Avalon,"" the image of a dying Arthur being ""barged"" away to his eternity of deathlessness, Boorman's film images are indelible, including those of the blood-red night riders and the glimpses of the knowing child-Morgaine.

If Boorman had spent time on exposition and still delivered the stunning visuals (the blood red sun in the background of the final battle between Mordred and Arthur is gorgeous when accompanied with Wagner's music), then this movie would have been 4 hours long.  And I would still love it.  The performaances are top-notch and it's amazing to see Nigel Terry playing a wise king after his wonderful performance as the snotty brat Prince John in The Lion in Winter.  Could this be the same person???  He took his Arthur characterization and used it in the TV series Covington Cross, which sadly only lasted 6 episodes in 1992.  Liam Neeson is fun to see in a small role and Nicholas Clay is the handsome, shining knight straight out of legend. No wonder Guenevere had the hots for him!  And Nicol Williamson is the dottiest Merlin ever -- he's been around for eons, so he's entitled to some eccentricities.  Even if some historical aspects (like the armor) aren't exactly on the mark, it's a legend -- not history!

Tell a student of Arthurian legends of the differences between ""L'Morte D""Artur"" and ""Excalibur"" and they might suspect the story is a dumbing-down of the Arthurian legend for the masses.And that's simply not the point of ""Excalibur"".""Excalibur"" is filmed with great care and attention to detail in showing the transition that is symbolic of the Dark Ages making way for the new ideas and Christianity taking root. It's about what the king is all about, and why a king has power in our imaginations. It's about vicious wars giving way to hope, and the danger of complacency and comfort. It's about more than it seems.John Boorman went through incredible pains to make this movie as exacting as he did, and you can see it. He didn't want to merely retell the well known legend of Arthur and his world. He wanted to illustrate the meaning behind Arthur himself. The sword was merely a connection and metaphor for that power and purpose. In the end, the story was about the myth of the king and how his condition was once believed to be the extension and direct representation of the state of the kingdom he actually ruled.But forgetting all of that, the movie is cool.

The second time i watched this movie, many years later, I had to use my remote control, as the boredom was almost unbearable. A few days ago, i tried to watch the movie again. This time i could not even finish it, shut down the TV, and went to the beer cooler to recover from the very bad impression this movie gave me. It is surprising to see the many positive reviews this movie has. Indeed, the movie is overrated. My opinion is that many people who saw this movie as children, still have good memories about it, and keep reviewing it positively. Also, as the theme of the movie is very appealing and famous (hey, we are talking about the round table, King Arthur, Merlin, blah blah), they just confuse the myth and the movie, and my belief is that they are rating the quality of the Arthurian legend and myth rather than the movie itself. Excalibur is a very slow movie, with shallow characters, very bad actors( have you seen the King Arthur they gave us???) and an even worse direction, plot and script. Also, the movie is too long. I could not recover from the bad impression it gave me the King Arthur Character and the actor who portrayed it. Maybe the actor was a relative of someone in the management of the studio, or there was a mistake, or perhaps the director was drunk and wanted to make fun of the audience. They just depict and portray King Arthur as a person who would not be even fit to take an IQ test to clean toilets¡¡¡¡ Watch it, and unfortunately you will agree with me. That Arthur has no chemistry, intelligence, not to mention charisma¡¡¡ a Big mistake.

136,berberian00-276-69085,Holy Grail for the Adults,10,29 January 2014,"""Excalibur"" (1981) appears to be the most prized Movie coming from the so called King Arthur Films List. This is easy to establish if you do some research in Wikipedia. Next to nothing emerge when you try to make a selection out of those 50 something movies that refer to the subject at hand. I don't mean to embellish anyone, but it seems hard and cumbersome task to have watched all those titles for a rather long historical period - the Dark Ages if we mean precisely for Historians and the 20th century cinema if we mean film critics. It's important. Beside the fact that ""King Arthur"" has become a household name and has been studied by little kids from 1sr grade, the name of that dynast or monarch has insignificant connotation in the mind of adults. Adults are occupied with the job of bread-winning and don't necessarily have to know who the Hero is, where he lived and die, or when. This is obsolete because even if you wish, there are sparse chances to find all answers in a nutshell.I spent whole afternoon reading about King Arthur. I have a large library and possess half-a-dozen books strictly on the topic. That doesn't mean that I am an expert on Arthurian Romances. The theme of British Mythology is very complicated. With respect to the fact that English is the most widely read language today worldwide, that Internet offers most of its information in English language, and that most of WWW servers are based on formerly British territories - what else do you want. Thus I reconcile with myself because I think, at least to the nominal, that I belong to the classical heritage of the Greek-Roman World. Those were the pillars that made the foundation of Europe, its Empires and Republics, and then straight to the Americas. This was the world of Christianity and King Arthur was its First Christian Hero, mythical or not. But let the archaeology speak about it.Joseph of Arimathea is key figure here. He participated in the burial of Jesus and gathered his blood on crucifixion in a chalice (Holy Grail). Joseph was tin trader and had ships trading with British Isles. Jesus had accompanied him as a boy in one of his travels and built a small chapel on Glastonbury Hill (Somerset). In his later life, Joseph of Arimathea returned to Glastonbury as disciple of St. Philip (63 A.D.) and stayed there till end of life, keeper of the Holy Grail. Other stories may tell otherwise, but King Arthur was the first ruler to have initiated Quest for the Holy Grail. Most notoriously about King Arthur wrote Geoffrey of Monmouth (1150) and Thomas Malory (1460) in their semi-romantic (Romanesque) histories - cf., Camelot Castle, Knights of the Round Table, Excalibur Sword, etc. are mainly their fabrication. Other nations in their Medieval Literature and Romances pretend to be localization of Holy Grail Keeper (France, Germany, Scotland, etc.) but essentially King Arthur is Welsh and Cymru Cymraeg.I wish to finish with few words on John Boorman, producer of ""Excalibur"" (1981). Very extravagant film magnate with special touch in every Movie he made. Specially creative is in the period 1967-1987, when produced films like ""Point Blank"" (1967), ""Hell in the Pacific"" (1968), ""Deliverance"" (1972) - his best movie, ""Zardoz"" (1974), ""Emerald Forest"" (1985). Thank you!",Excalibur
137,dbogosian-1,"big on atmosphere, short on plot",7,3 May 2007,"The problem with this movie may well be the source material. I've never read the original stories, but I gather (from other comments) this movie was quite true to them, both in the micro as well as the macro sense. To the viewer, however, it comes across as totally disjointed, a bunch of pieces that don't add up to very much together. At the end (and at several points along the way), I felt dissatisfied with the way the tensions between characters were (or were not) being resolved. And in the end, (nearly) everyone is killed, Arthur sails away to the great beyond, and we have no idea what the point of this whole exercise was? What did these knights ever accomplish? How did the country ever benefit from their services and sacrifices? Again, I strongly suspect these are the same issues with the literary sources and not unique to the movie, but all the same, it leaves the viewer grasping for something to hang on to.The film is very well made, though. Lots of good action and fight scenes, and the overall medieval feel comes through very well. The cinematography is excellent and well thought out. Some of the scenic views as the knights are out searching for the grail, those are awesome. The acting is top notch, especially Merlin and Arthur who were very convincing. Arthur's transition from youth to old man was surprisingly credible.I also couldn't help comparing to Monty Python and the Holy Grail. At first I thought MP copied/borrowed/parodied this movie, but then I saw that MP preceded this one by a few years. In light of that, I'm surprised the makers of Excalibur kept as many obvious tie-ins as they did; little things, like limbs getting slashed off with blood spurting out (cf. the Black Knight), or the ghostly music when the grail appears, that sort of thing; or even the rabbit roasting on the spit.And speaking of music, the soundtrack for Excalibur is often pathetic. It careens back and forth from a really cool, convincing medieval sound (including Carmina Burana to great effect) to this sappy string and flute orchestra sound that was just awful.Oh, and the horrid font for the credits: what *were* they thinking? It looks like an ad for ice cream, not medieval dark ages with knights in armor.Overall, worth viewing, but far from flawless.",Excalibur
138,pranderson063095,One may well grow to like this movie.,9,6 May 2021,"I really did not like this film for the first 40 minutes. But I came to like it once Arthur stopped being Henry II's petulant youngest John. Nigel Terry just barely works. He looks to much like the imbecile John in Lion In Winter and early on act that way too. As most of the film becomes a pleasure to watch the feeble attempts at comedy/humor make me think of Monty Python rendition of prancing knights with no horses. Clippity Clop.The quality and story otherwise being near excellent, we can look past the poor casting of Arthur, Merlin, and Percival. Also the amateurish bits of the directors. It is such there had to be some assistants directing.",Excalibur
139,FloodClearwater,"Unenlightened Arthuriana, Darkening Further?",6,24 August 2015,"For years this film remained atop the viewing preferences list of many a medieval genre buff for the simple reason of its existence. Excalibur was a bold effort, boosters would say, to try and wrap live action around the Arthurian legend, a big story seen through a dark glass for want of historical aids. But the film is no longer aging well, and in fact the entropy of it is accelerating. With the advent of new histories of the post-Roman, pre-Alfred British Isles by the likes of Norman Davies, and the lifelike historical fictions treating the same times and places by the likes of Bernard Cornwell, characters in the Arthur saga now seem ridiculous to us if they are not portrayed as reasonably modern in personality and psychology.The lead characters in Excalibur--consider the lords sitting at the feast hall table at the film's first interior scene--are portrayed as near-savages. Their communications include visceral growls and guttural sounds behind gnashed teeth. This depiction always seemed juvenile, but before the good histories and the good fictions illuminated the age for us, enthusiasts for the film batted away the creeping sense of sophomoric primalness the actors were directed to display as, 'well in those days they ate very bad food, and carried quite heavy swords, and so they growled all the time.'The better our popular histories and storytelling got about Dark Ages Britain, the less and fewer charms Excalibur seemed to hold. This falling of blood-soaked wool was then compounded by new films such as Clive Owen's ""King Arthur."" New films which, regardless of whether their histories were classical or revisionist, at least got the modern human sensibilities of the characters right.Read Cornwell's Merlin in Excalibur, Enemy of God, or The Winter King. Cornwell's Merlin is urbane, brilliant, affable, solipsistic. And whether or not we find Cornwell's visage of Merlin to our liking, we must surrender the fact that his personality is plausible because it is so human and so humanistic. Now hold up the portrayal of Merlin by Nicol Williamson that John Boorman directed in the film. That Merlin is by comparison ghastly, an unconvincing theater clown in a (chrome?) skullcap.Some songs don't age well with us as we learn more about, hear more of, music. Some paintings we are besotted with in our first museum lose their allure, becoming less brilliant with each new museum we visit. Surely this Excalibur still has a place in the hearts and libraries of ""sword film"" lovers, but it increasingly is a place that is less and less visited.",Excalibur
140,MoneyMagnet,Flawed yet timeless,8,23 April 2009,"To say that this version of the King Arthur legend isn't so much a drama as a series of tableaux, is hardly a criticism. The film unfolds in a deliberate and courtly fashion, you know everything that's going to happen, almost every line that's going to be uttered -- and yet because of the obvious love for the legend and the commitment of all involved, it's simply the most successful film about the Arthurian legend that ever was or ever will be made. (I don't even know why people try to do King Arthur movies any more.) Yet, it is very much a movie of its time - back when fantasy could be an adult subject (and oh, how ""adult"" this movie was, but not without thoughtful purpose) and you could have philosophy and thrills in the same movie. That this was considered at the time by some reviewers to be a ""boring"" or ""flat"" film compared to others of its day, shows you how far Hollywood has sunk from the level of film-making in the '70s and '80s.At the heart of Boorman's Excalibur is an exultant hope that speaks to all ages and especially our age here in the early 21st century. That although good things must come to an end, as long as we behave with courage and honor, and pay attention to the spiritual and mystery of the universe (embodied by Merlin), we can let go of what we possess now, and still hope for a greater future to come.",Excalibur

Answer : I doubt anyone could outdo this film for being in bad taste, being crammed full of historical and literary inaccuracies, being full of over-the-top melodramatic claptrap, replete with a complete lack of common sense. This film is an absolute waste of any viewer's time. I just could not believe how terrible it was. Is. Every actor, except the one playing Morganna (and she even falters on occasion), cheerfully mistakes intense voice-breaking volume for earnestness. This includes, worst of all, the actor ineptly playing the pivotal part of Merlin. People shouting at each other for the entire length of the film gets very old, very quickly.

142,bigwig_thalyi,Real might and magic.,9,22 July 2005,"This is not the Arthur of ""First Knight"" or childhood fable,this is an Arthur of might,magic and brutality. This movie strips away any pre conceived ideas that knights were noble and spent their time rescuing maidens in distress. This film showed that in reality the world of the medieval knight was one of violence and brutality where fighting was up close,in your face and death by a sword was not pretty. Some of the battle scenes were the most brutal i have ever seen in a movie. It wasn't just the fights that were brutal some the images were pretty gruesome as well.One that stands out in my mind is a crow plucking out the eyeball of a half rotten corpse. King Arthur was played by Nigel Terry who was impressive as a king racked by indecision and tortured by the knowledge that his queen was sleeping with Lancelot ,who was his best knight and his best friend Nicol Williamson was enigmatic as Merlin,the wizard,who was willing to use his magic to help Arthur while realising that the time of magic was passing to be replaced by the time of man. Helen Mirren was deliciously evil as Morgana who slept with Arthur,her brother,to enable her to give birth to Mordred who would be pivotal in the death of Arthur. Morganas'death at the hands of her son was another brutal scene that embodied the violence of the era. This film is very violent. Some scenes definitely make you wince and some will literally turn your stomach but this film has some rare moments of great beauty,the wedding of Arthur to Guinevere being one that springs most readily to mind. this is certainly not a film for children but as an adult adventure it pushes all the right buttons.i would give this 9/10",Excalibur
143,claybo76,A classic epic retelling of the oldest fairytale,8,6 May 1999,"Having only seen this film in the last two years, it really hasn't dated. While not as graphic, the battle scenes are as brutal and terrifying as Braveheart.  The acting is first rate and the imagery is fantastic.I love the old story of Arthur and Excalibur.  There have been so many rehashes in film and cartoon alike, but this has to be the best version. An extremely enjoyable movie, easy to watch over and over again.  Highly recommended.",Excalibur
144,Pigalina,So good,8,11 October 2005,"This is one of my Dad's favourite movies. He sometimes quotes from it in a crazy voice. I now know why, Nigel Terry who plays King Arthur, has a very thick English-farmer accent. Excalibur is a great film, I didn't know the whole story of King Arthur before - it is very sordid. Not only was Arthur conceived when his father was magically transformed into his (Arthur's) mother's husband who was dying at that very moment, there is incest and adultery to boot. The man who plays Merlin, Nicol Williamson, sounds (and sort of looks) like Alec Guiness of Obi-Wan Kenobi fame. I thought it was him at first. The whole movie looked marvelous - lot's of armour, castles and jousting. Arthur went a bit crazy after Guinivere cheated on him, fair enough I suppose, but he should have listened to Merlin, who warned him against her when Arthur first mentioned that he liked her. He sent his knights on a huge quest for the Holy Grail which is not only fruitless but is the only boring wee patch of the film. Don't worry though because it is only very brief. I am refusing to even watch the new King Arthur movie which looks like a huge pile of steaming crap. This movie is true to the legend (even though I admit that I don't know it inside out) whereas the other one has Guinivere (great name by the way) as some sort of Amazon warrior wearing strips of leather. RIDICULOUS!",Excalibur
145,TJMBuddlake,A Remarkable film with a great cast,9,7 April 2012,"This movie has got to be an epic story-telling masterpiece of King Arthur. What hasn't been said about this movie. Remarkable story, great cast, the sets were great, the special effects were good. The cast was phenomenal. Nigel Terry played Arthur perfectly, he had that leadership role down flat. Nicol Williamson played Merlin very damn good. He had that mysterious look and glitz that brought Merlin to life. Helen Mirren as Morgana is what really surprised me. I'm used too her in National Treasure 2 and Red, but this role just showed me that she is a well-refined actress. The rest of the cast were true brilliant stars, Gabriel Byrne, Patrick Stewart, Liam Neeson, to name a few really grasped their roles that would launch their brilliant careers. This movie I recommend for any history buffs. Overall, 9 out of 10.",Excalibur
146,guylyons,Has not stood the test of time,7,1 March 2017,"This film should be seen, as it has good things about it. However trying to cram into a couple of hours the whole story of the king Arthur, shows up the film's limitations. There is simply far too much to tell, and looking at today's dramas like game of thrones, it simply looks dated. There is a quality T V series waiting to be made about the complete Arthurian legend, on the scale of game of Thrones, with a colossal world wide audience of millions and millions. I have yet to see a proper film of the Arthurian legend, having read the Lancing Green book as a kid. What I liked about the book was there was so much of a story to be told, and if it had to be re made as a film, there would need to be at least three.",Excalibur
147,Johnny B,Bloody representation of popular legend,10,26 October 1998,"This is a great movie.  From the very beginning, before Arthur's conception, it is gripping.  It is a mixture of the most popular Arthurian legends, still it holds together and the final product is excellent.  Its sex scenes are quite shocking - in fact a great deal of importance seems to be given to these scenes.  The battle scenes are no good for the tender-hearted - my sister nearly fainted watching them. The gory detail of blood being spilt and body parts flying here and there are alarming.  Still, back to square 1, it is a great movie and it depicts fittingly the era in which it is set. After all the Middle Ages did not only consist of monks copying old manuscripts in convents.  It mainly consisted of wars, bloodshed and mutilation.  And this is the picture this movie gives, from beginning to end.  Explicit entertainment in all ways - a must see to all lovers of medieval culture.",Excalibur
148,ETO_Buff,What's With All The Headbands?,2,10 March 2006,"Patrick Stewart had a bit part in this movie, and Liam Neeson played Sir Gawain. I wondered while I was watching it if either of them ever regretted being in such a bad movie. Besides the acting, one of the worst things about this one was that all of the knights wore headbands (as if we didn't know it was made in the eighties), and were always wearing full plate armor! If they had also worn spandex, the headbands would have been understandable, but wearing the armor all day, every day as opposed to normal clothing, was a bit trying on a person's common sense.It was pretty ridiculous from a factual and realistic point-of-view, and pretty much worth missing.",Excalibur

That he takes some liberties with the story of the Arthur saga is of no consequence. A myth aims to convey some strong moral ideas. This movie succeeds in this better than any other movie I know. The idea Borman compellingly depicts in this beautiful movie is the following. Men strive very hard at achieving harmony. Once in a while, for a short moment they succeed in realizing it. But than someone makes a small, stupid mistake (in casu: the affair between Lancelot and Guinevere) and the world falls back into war and disorder.

151,dracopticon,This film is my liege and has my total allegiance,10,16 May 2017,"With a magical green light among the meadows of old Roman-Keltic Britannia, John Boorman tells us the epic tale of a young squire who takes more upon his shoulders than any mortal man can be asked to do. Arthur, superbly played by Nigel Terry, is acted through the whole range from young, reluctant squire-thrust-into-kingship to tired and exhausted emperor of Camelot.And all characters here is portrayed most believable from the first rate acting of Helen Mirren, Nicholas Clay, Cherie Lunghi and others. The one though, that makes an effort that stands a head higher than the rest, is Nicol Williamson's Merlin.All I can say is, do not entangle yourself in historical fact hunting and correcting nit-picking of all the over-the-top weapons and armor belonging to other eras. It's the saga of eternal values and the clashing of murky evil and brightly good in such as Paul Geoffrey's portrayal of Percival and his search for The Grail that stands out, not forgetting Charley Boorman's Mordred which is surprisingly good.",Excalibur
152,ignatz928,An uneven but memorable retelling of the Arthurian legend,6,30 October 2005,"A very flawed movie, but still one I enjoy, if mainly as a visualization of the Arthurian legends. One problem is that John Boorman, director, co-writer, and overall driving force behind the project, tries to cram the entire legend of King Arthur into 140 minutes, and as a result is unable to sustain much narrative momentum and often seems to be rushing through the story. Excalibur is often cheesy, with bad dialogue (""I, the best knight in the world, bested!""), and overacting, particularly in the opening scenes, where the knights can't seem to utter a word without growling. The production design, while evocative in some scenes, in others reveals Boorman's stretching of a less than generous budget, such as in the cut-rate set of Merlin's ""crystal"" cave. And despite the scope of the film, the number of participants in a battle rarely suggest more than a small-scale skirmish. For all of these flaws, I don't hate Excalibur. Some of the cheesy acting and dialogue is unintentionally funny, though the rustic accent used by Nigel Terry to play Arthur in his younger years is truly irritating. Luckily, by the end his performance has greatly improved, gradually taking on the kind of quiet, uncomplicated dignity that I always imagine Arthur as possessing. The actor who plays Percival also turns in an effective performance in the potentially embarrassing role of the ""holy fool."" The best performance by far, however, is by Nicol Williamson as Merlin. He probably overacts more than anyone else in the movie, but in his case it's obviously intentional. Boorman's choices for Guinever and Lancelot are least impressive, with Guinevere coming across as little more than a pretty Irish peasant girl, and Lancelot as a bland hunk. Their affair is one of the film's weakest elements, a casualty of Boorman's determination to fit the entire Arthurian corpus into a single movie. This is how he establishes the beginning of their illicit feelings for each other; Guinevere runs into Lancelot, he gazes soulfully into her eyes, she gazes soulfully back, and the opening theme from Tristan and Isolde blares onto the soundtrack. This problem extends to Boorman's use of musical themes in general; his choices are unoriginal but effective, but they're also too few, and are consequently are used too many times with too little variation. On the plus side, Excalibur is visually spectacular, and Boorman crafts plenty of plenty of memorable scenes, such as Merlin's hilltop, torch-lit exhortation to the knights following a battle (cribbed liberally from Henry V). Boorman also handles Arthur's conception with plenty of audacity and stylistic panache. Arthur's father Uther, transformed by Merlin into the shape of the Duke of Cornwall, has sex with the man's wife while the real Duke lies dying in battle against the King's troops. As if this wasn't weird enough, throughout the entire sex scene Uther wears full armor (or nearly full armor, I guess), and all of this is juxtaposed with Cornwall dying, bloodily impaled on a spear. In contrast to the baroque insanity of the opening scenes, Boorman creates a touching and reverent conclusion for the story, capped off by the indelible image of Arthur, revived from a sort of spiritual coma, riding out to battle with his men through a shower of flower petals.",Excalibur
153,eapplebaum,So 1981,8,5 March 2013,"I am watching this film for the 1st time ever. I have always loved Medieval (fantasy) but somehow missed this film 30 yrs ago. Now, watching it I find it interesting to see why I would not have liked a film of this kind back then. It starts out as a superficial and kind of hollow version of the story (compared to so many other more recent versions of the story), but it has some fantastic elements that mark it as a classic story of King Arthur. For one it's fascinating to see some great actors over 30 yrs ago when they were young, particularly Helen Mirran, who imho gives the best performance and is so beautiful. Most of them look the same. But I find, some of the actors had not quite honed their acting skills yest, and the Directing was..dare I say...imho lame. There's a lot of yelling and most of the time everyone is in a state of perpetual urgency. it's a bit annoying that all the women speak (except Helen Mirran's Morgana) in feigned high pitch voices.

154,xenophil,Intelligent but trashy-looking,6,24 January 2001,"'Excalibur' is an intelligent interpretation of the Arthurian legend.   I appreciate the attempt to convey some of the symbolic depth and psycho-sexual aspects of the story.   But the Camelot saga is also poetry. It should be evocative and beautiful.    Despite the use of generous, even spectacular sets and fine outdoor locations, and lavish, probably authentic-looking armour, the movie has a trashy, dated look.    All the actresses looked tarty, the actors floppy and goofy.  There was no overall look to the costumes and sets, unless it is eighties club schlock.   For example, Camelot castle seems to be made of aluminum blocks, and Guinevere's wedding veil of mylar tinsel.  The set for the final confrontation of Merlin and Morgana reminded me of a lava lamp.The casting is disappointing. Lancelot wasn't too bad, but only Merlin had anything like the appropriate gravity.  I know the story of how Arthur came to be king is an 'Ugly Duckling' story, but the failure to deliver an adult Arthur so devoid of kingly dignity is artistic negligence!I was interested to notice that John Boorman has portrayed the collapse of a utopian society at least twice - here, and in 'Zardoz'.",Excalibur
155,Magellan Grey,Entertaining and Pure.,8,10 February 2004,Very operatic and stylish in its presentation.  It strikes one as an direct interpretation from a book of legends complete with the syntax.  I am not totally familiar with the legend of King Arthur and the sword Excalibur but I truly enjoyed watching this movie.  The excellent usage of Richard Wagner's operatic classic Gotterdammerung.  This ovature added to the pathos of the story.  It magnified the mystical glory of the death of Arthur at the end with his body being born away into the west by the three spirits (graces?) as Perceval watched from the shore.  That scene in itself sent chills through me.A very enjoyable film.,Excalibur
156,Steviereno,A great treatment of the Arthurian legend,10,1 July 2019,"I checked the spoiler box, yet how can a story 800 years old be spoiled by one review? Reviewing the eternal story can hardly miss telling something of the story.Lo, these many years since I first watched Excalibur, and a few viewings, I have nothing but praise for this movie. Another review pointed at the final battle with Mordred, and I have to put down what I realized the first time watching that scene. I realized that all the main characters were analogs for parts of a person's psyche - male, female, dark side, light side, core energy, wisdom, purity, emotional, hero, warrior, saboteur, logical, etc. (My terms, borrowed from others.) At that moment, I had to flash back through the story to each character and do a quick test. In doing all that I had two linkages that came to mind. One is that eternal stories need to have all these, like Arthur, and like Star Trek, and like hero stories everywhere. For them to last, the more of those essences have characters, the longer the story lives on in the human psyche. I didn't force this - it just hit me. Star Trek had Kirk and Spock and Bones and Uhura and Chekov and Sulu, etc. Each was a part of KIRK's psyche. It was a hero story about the Kirk character. Kirk was the hero. Spock was his logical self. Bones was the emotional self. Uhura was the feminine self. Where the Arthurian story had the MacGuffin item of the sword, Excalibur, Star Trek had what? The Enterprise, perhaps.In Excalibur, it was a hero story about Arthur, the hero. Guinevere was the feminine self. Merlin the logical self and magical self. Mordred was the dark side of self. Morgana was the feminine dark side. I am not any sort of expert on mythical stories, so I can't take it past that very far. But that both hero stories have endured - Star Trek LONG after I had the first inkling in 1981 (a decade before TNG came along to carry the story forward with Picard and HIS archetypal crew) - and that I DID apply it to Star Trek, too - this suggests that I was onto something. Hero stories last and last. WHY? Because we can see and identify the parts of ourselves in the story and the characters and the challenges and the resolutions, too - in our own self-hero story, of our lives.Arthur and Mordred HAD to kill each other and die such a wonderful death, to merge their essences, their archetypes, if you will, and to make the hero whole, dark side and light side both within him, and extinguishing both.Is any of this correct? I find it correct for me, and how I have now viewed both for 38 years. A Long time. All this is besides how lush and textured this telling is. Boorman had become my favorite director before this, but Excalibur took him up to levels unforeseen in my mind before. (I wish he'd been more prolific, but I generally have loved his work.) Even his actors were so excellently chosen, though I can't remember their names. The actress who played Guinevere was so magically and unprotectedly feminine. The Lancelot actor depicted such a pure warrior, almost feminine himself, unable to fight love, his weakness his heart. The Arthur actor was so innocent to so much in life, a Tarot's Fool card, bumping into life even though lord of all the domain. Merlin's actor was so able to allow the powers to rule everything, though he had his fingers on the pulse all the time. Mordred's actor's dark portrayal showed how we are doomed to follow certain paths even to our clear demise, out ahead. The actress's Morgana manipulated for purposes she thought she commanded, so darkly, so insistently, and so doom-pointed for all. It simply was a nearly perfect portrayal of a hero and the many sides he is oblivious to, as the story ends, a fool off into the wild beyond. (Now apply any or all of that to Star Trek, and it fits a lot. Kirk, off 'where no man has gone before"" - really? No MAN? This alone tells us it is the story/mythos of the hero, Kirk. That Arthur was also the story's uniter of England, he was taking England where it had not gone before, but also himself.) Carl Jung must have had fun with the Arthurian hero story. I did.A WONDERFUL movie, with lessons for all us humans, and wonderfully done. A movie not to miss.",Excalibur
157,eichler2,"So over the top, it's perfect",10,28 May 2017,"I was recently watching a Sherlock Holmes movie from the 70s on one of those TV channels devoted to old movies, and my wife walked in, watched about a minute of it and said ""I'm pretty sure the guy playing Sherlock is the same actor who played Merlin in Excalibur"". And of course, she was right. She loved Excalibur so much back in the 80s that she bought a framed copy of the movie poster which hangs proudly in our living room.So that observation led us to dig out our DVD of Excalibur and watch it for the first time in decades. And you know what? It still holds up. You can tell by some of the hairstyles, effects and other details that it was made in the 1980s, but overall this movie has aged remarkably well. And a lot of the actors who were unknowns (at least to us) back then have become household names in the years since (Helen Mirren, Gabriel Byrne, Liam Neeson, Patrick Stewart).Now, one could certainly make the argument that this film is way over the top in nearly every aspect. The actors chew so much scenery that you can almost hear the director off screen yelling ""More! Bigger! Sell it!"" Everyone wears shiny armor all the time, the good guys are incredibly good and the bad guys are incredibly evil. And then there's the soundtrack that uses a ton of Wagner and the O Fortuna section of Carmina Burana no less than three times. But it's all fitting for a serious film about the Arthurian legends. If the scene towards the end where Arthur, recently healed by the holy grail, rides out with his knights and brings the land back to life while O Fortuna blares in the background doesn't bring a tear to your eye, you might be dead.Balancing out all this seriousness to some degree is the character of Merlin (played wonderfully by Nicol Williamson), who has a few wicked one-liners and adds a much-needed dose of subtle humor to nearly every scene he's in.Many of the actors do a remarkable job of portraying their characters all the way from youth to old age. It's almost hard to believe that it's Nigel Terry playing both the young Arthur who acts as a squire for his brother at a joust early in the film and the elderly, gray-haired Arthur in the climactic battle.Another reviewer mentioned that this film came out just a few years after Monty Python's Holy Grail movie (which I also love) making Excalibur play almost like an anti-parody, with many nearly identical scenes done with deadly earnestness. Well...of course the movies are going to have similar scenes - they're both based on the same legends. The Pythons just took it in a comedic direction while Boorman played it mostly straight.All in all, this will probably always be my favorite King Arthur movie. Before the Lord of the Rings movies came along, this was the best epic fantasy film I'd ever seen. And it's still one of the best.",Excalibur

I don't know where to begin, but perhaps all I really need to say is that the casting of Nigel Terry as Arthur ranks as one of the greatest casting blunders of all time. His weak face, his lack of conviction, his negligible screen presence -- it's just totally baffling. In this film, the sun never shines, and the players never smile. Ah yes, the players. They bark their lines as if they are performing in the round at the Globe Theater or, alternatively, upstaging Cary Grant and Katharine Hepburn in their latest screwball comedy. Seriously, has there ever been more incoherent dialogue? And, if you hadn't read the Classic Comic back in the 1950s, would you have ever had a clue what this movie is (ostensibly) about? The direction. So stiff, so uneven, so uninspired. It's just a complete mess, and, despite the acting achievements of the players in other endeavors, I decline to get caught up in the usual momentum, where bad movies are invariably praised because they are not just bad, but astoundingly bad. This is storytelling at its very worst,and doleful, dark, and dreary only suggest how awful this movie is.",Excalibur

That really describes everything there is to say.When you can make a movie that looks worse than a comedy, that was intentionally made to look terrible, years earlier, you've just got to be bad, and this was bad. When you can watch the last two seasons of Stargate SG1 and get a better story of King Arthur, than a movie ""based on"" the myths, you've got some movie making issues.

Indeed the music score does contain a good bit of Wagner's score. While I love the story of Arthur and his knights, I found myself dissatisfied with this rendition. Based on Malory's Morte d'Arthur, the dialogue often sounds stilted, even for such a period piece. Most is delivered in a manner better suited to Shakespeare's blank verse. The actors sound as if they are on a stage declaiming to an audience. The sequence of events is mostly episodic,Where more action is needed, the scene simply fades to black.With his odd accent and weirdly accented syllables,Apparently he's the comic relief of this dark piece.There's epic splendor, beautiful scenery and the costumes, and the armor, look authentic. Giving a tint of green, the color of magic to various men and objects lends a touch of supernatural aura to the entire story.This movie has its moments and it was enjoyable, but...it needed something, perhaps more fleshing-out of the script instead of merely following a basic outline of a well-known story.This movie is owned by me and no remuneration was involved in the writing of this review.",Excalibur

The rest of the cast was equally good including many newcomers such as Liam Nisson, Patrick Stewart, Helen Mirren and Gabriel Byrne. All very popular actors today and they can all credit this movie as their stepping stone. I admired and pitied the character of Sir Lancelet. He was a tremendous hero and athlete and very well respected. He was the simply the greatest and most honorable knight ever and yet... how sad that his one true love, his soulmate, Gwenhwyfar, could never, ever, be his. To have her and betray the love he shared with his best friend and king, Arthur, hurt him more deeply than any sword could ever do.

172,ninja_superstar-1,Comments on the edited USA version,6,25 May 2005,"I think I would have enjoyed an extended version of this film. The edited version seems choppy at times, especially during the first half of the film.Visuals: This is a beautiful movie. The cinematography is wonderful and recreates the world of King Arthur with a great sense of imagination. It's a pre-industrial world completely filled with trees and rife with nature and magic. The color green is everywhere. Even swords and armor  stuff of the earth forged by man  have a greenish hue to them. The director's patience with lengthy scenes is truly appreciated.However, the fake blood is distracting and some of the battle wounds look like props.Sound: The sound is mostly great. Sometimes the swords and armor sound rather tinny, but this is not an overall problem. The music is great and works well with the visuals.Story: This is a difficult story to tell. After all, Thomas Malory's _Le Morte D'Arthur_ is over 1,000 pages long. John Boorman condenses the story without totally diluting the characters. Some paring down is inevitable, but the viewer is left relatively satisfied.Acting: This is by far the most inconsistent and distracting element of the film (and it may be due to the 21 minutes worth of editing in the USA version I viewed, but I cannot say). Nigel Terry (King Arthur) is not a very strong lead actor. In the first half of the film, he doesn't seem to transform from a squire to a king convincingly. He's wooden at times, makes weird facial expressions, mumbles through lines, and, sorry to say, is quite ugly with that mullet he's got going on. In the second half of the film, when he grows a beard, he not only looks better but he also suddenly learns how to act. In the first part of the film, he doesn't have any control over his voice. Eventually, though, he becomes quite authoritative and believable.Nicol Williamson is extremely inconsistent as Merlin, and, as with Nigel Terry, most of the problem has to do with the inflection of his voice. Sometimes, Williamson delivers lines entirely through his nose. That nasal, pseudo-Shakespearean is simply pompous. The only times he's actually dramatic and a pleasure to watch and listen to are the times he's with Morgana (Helen Mirren). Apparently, the two didn't like each other, and Mirren definitely brings out the actor in Williamson.All of the supporting roles are fairly well acted.Overall: I couldn't watch the film all at once. The questionable acting in the beginning was simply too bothersome. The final 80 minutes or so is smoother and is probably the least edited from the original. Boorman could have easily cast Liam Neeson as King Arthur and Patrick Stewart as Merlin. Some actual lead actors would have made the film 10 times better.",Excalibur
173,blowfly13,"captures the spirit of the legend, with awesome music",10,7 October 2007,"This is one of my favorite movies. At first it seems sort of weird, with the actors speaking in weird, choppy ways, and parts of scenes that seem almost like Monty Python and the Holy Grail (e.g., an arm cut off and blood spurting), and Merlin seems particularly odd. And of course the details vary from whichever book you might be familiar with, as those books vary from each other. But as the movie goes on, I found that it perfectly captured the SPIRIT of the story, which in my opinion is far more important than retelling the story word for word or fact by fact - movies that do that always seem so dry and flat. Nigel Terry was excellent as Arthur; in the early scenes he managed to look and sound like a dolt, and to grow from there into a self-possessed king. Nicol Williamson was great as Merlin; making him seem odd turned out to be the right thing to do, since he's a magician. I didn't particularly like the actors who played Guenevere and Lancelot, but maybe that's because those two characters are so unlikable, as the cheaters who betray their king and help bring about his downfall. I was happy to see Gabriel Byrne and Patrick Stewart. But the thing that really makes this movie for me is the amazing soundtrack. Boorman choose his classical music perfectly, and the special recordings are better than any I've heard. Siegfried's Funeral March is also one of my favorites, and thank you Norman Del Mar for toning down those damn bells! My only complaint about the movie is that it moves right from the creation of Camelot to the downfall, without showing even a tiny bit of the knights doing good - saving maidens in distress, righting wrongs - that were the main point of the legends. If you didn't know the story, it might be pretty difficult to see why the downfall was so tragic.",Excalibur
174,octagonproplex,Don't believe the hype,2,24 May 2017,"If any should find the verbiage of the review impenetrable, then congratulations, you possess the prerequisite disabilities necessary for deciphering the deeper logic of this illogically lauded landmark of cinematic stupidity. But by all means, I do welcome someone to please reasonably enlighten what exactly is good about this movie... And while I wait for pigs to fly -- and before getting onto the intricacies of its incompetence -- I will first, in as pithy a fashion as can be mustered, thoroughly explain precisely what is bad about this movie now: EVERYTHING.I first encountered director John Boorman's 1981 abomination ""Excalibur"" on VHS as a child of that decade. and without any passion recalled only that it never particularly resonated, aside from its memorable molestation of Carl Orff's fantastic ""Oh Fotruna"" on the soundtrack. Under the ignorant indoctrination of distance, I eventually succumbed to the assumption within popular consensus that it must be pretty good -- afterall, its status as the finest cinematic translation of Arthurian legend is constantly evoked to the point of having created its very own mini mythos. Upon resent sober reevaluation, I disturbingly found myself at a complete loss as to what could have possibly gained this film such a following of ardent acclaimers. I do not know what necromancy has perpetrated such a mass delusion upon this vocal constituency, but their adoration is patently misplaced. Due to its utter incomprehensibility, as I attempt to critique the wall-to-wall flaws of this film, I will dwell exclusively on the deficiencies that render its ponderous plotting unintelligible rather than dare delve into the details of describing the silly scenes arbitrarily stitched together to resemble its said plot.An incoherent unfocused mishmash of checklist attributes found in Arthurian Lore does not unto itself make for engaging cinematic storytelling, when the needed essentials of solid drama are shunned. I stress the faults within Excalibur's ""cinematic language"" here, because regardless of its adherence to sequential events, it is the dramatist's very purpose to call upon technique to link those happenings with a rationale that lends them credence, creating a suspension of disbelief for their fantastical nature to nevertheless ring true. Rather than allowing even a summery reading, the movie plays like being granted only the chapter titles and footnotes from a sprawling novel to glean inference from, without sufficient context of the vast content composed between to inform how each random caption connects to a cohesive whole. Any decent yarn-spinner resigns to the responsibility to at minimum entertain, if not edify. Artists enter into intmate bonds of good faith with captive audiences, assuring that their attentive trust is a reciprocal investment that will be rewarded in kind with some recognizable or relevant reflection of life as comformation of a shared humanity and therein pay off the indebted obligation owed for luring their patronage. Absent in Boorman's ""Excalibur"" is any variant of satisfying narrative tropes; Establishing the stakes for audiences to buy into, through engrossing conflicts, relatable ambitions, and objective goals. The anticipatory tensions and delights derived from setting up character and plot details, dynamics, quirks, traits, and motifs to be revisited in inventive ways. Using dramatic-irony, reversals- of-fortune, tragedies, and triumphs to engage empathy and entice desire toward resolution.In lieu of chivalrous ideals, Boorman lathers on stilted misogynistic posturing, and not much else. As a confirmed admirer of composer Trevor Jones, its with apprehension that I admit his music here provides nothing worth note, having been relegated to incidental ambiance due to the desperate amount of ""needle-dropping"" of Richard Wagner and Carl Orff -- whose classical pieces were already autonomously great before being desecrated in this nonsense and therefore cannot be applied by commandeered proxy to the picture's credit. Character nuance in thought process and relationship dynamics are non- existent, nor is any action granted even a crudely drawn motivation, therefore the drastically broad yet thin arcs are simply devoid of plausibility. The heavy- handed expositional dialogue is truly ridiculous -- every single word that comes out of a character's mouth is an embarrassingly lame soliloquy stating exactly what is already evident, but not explaining any reasoning for any of its indiscernible merit. For a film that employs many indisputably talented actors, it's quite the shameful accomplishment that every performance is over-the-top and affected with hysterically pretentious theatrics. The costume design, in all its gaudy grandeur, has not the slightest semblance of practicality -- all the knights just lounge around in shiny polished full body armor, while the caricatured buffoon Merlin wizards a meticulously tattered yet pristine jet black robe and nifty platinum skull cap. The production-design is like sets from a cheap stage play. If some trees seem to appear legit, I'm gonna go ahead and just credit nature and God for their surely accidental inclusion within this vulgar vomit. The usually great Alex Thompson's cinematography is all gauzy and unnatural light, with magical moments casting a nauseating ""non-diegetic"" neon green. At no time do any of the boringly vapid and across-the-board malevolent characters demonstrate a shred of rationality or principal to explain their lack thereof... the same is true for the filmmakers.I've heard the apologist excuse this clumsy pile of drivel because it was supposedly a revolutionary step forward for the fantasy genre in contemporary cinema. However this argument simply cannot hold water, when the fact that ""Excalibur"" arrived in the immediate wake of fantasy masterpieces like ""The Empire Strikes Back"" and ""Conan The Barbarian"" is taken into account. I could go on... but why? John ""Borefest"" Boorman's irredeemably tedious ""Excalibur"" is cheap, inane, inept, and flat-out awful.",Excalibur
175,chrisart7,twin films from the same 'father',9,18 August 2012,"Fans of ""Excalibur"" would find it interesting (puzzling at first, perhaps) to see it on a double bill with ""Deliverance"". John Boorman directed both films, and there are echoes of ""Deliverance"" (1972) throughout ""Excalibur"" (1981). Both films are about people living in wilderness vs. living in cities/castles (both manmade structures).

D: Ed (John Voight) falls into the water after the rope has snapped, but the mountain man's corpse and the entangled rope make it difficult for him to resurface.E: King Arthur (Nigel Terry) is wasting away in health, having lost his will to live (and Excalibur---and his wife and champion knight).

D: At the film's end Ed (John Voight) has a nightmare of the mountain man's hand emerging from the water (after having weighed his body down with a large stone tied to a rope).Interesting to compare and contrast these two; Rospo Pallenberg also had a hand in both films.",Excalibur
176,nomercy,Transcendental,10,12 May 1999,"Having read ""the knights of the round table"" as a child, and ""Le Morte D'Artur"" in old English as an adult, I have always been profoundly touched by this story of rise, fall, love, hate, betrayal and hope. As a result, I have developed an intense dislike for most pathetic attempts to put this story on film.Excalibur is the first, and so far, the only film, in my opinion, to come very close to the brass ring.First some ranting.The early film with Cornel Wilde was a swashbuckling story, no more.The Disney cartoon ""sword in the stone"" was one of the first in a long series of extremely offensive attempts to take inspirational and tragic stories and turn them into something  banal.(Anastasia, The hunch Back of Notre Dame to name a couple)First knight was perfect for displaying Richard Geere's lack of talent, and wasting a perfectly good actor (Connery). This ranks up there with ""Plan nine from outer space""Excalibur has put faces to the characters I read about. It infused them with personalities, and gave them life beyond the pages.I was transposed by Merlin's magic on the mountain top, awakening the dragon. I felt a strange elation when Arthur drew the sword, one of the most meaningful and defining moments in literary, and now movie, history. I trembled and rejoiced when Arthur handed Excalibur to Uriens and was knighted. And my eyes welled up with tears when the ship took his body away to AvalonAnd the music... That glorious music, never intrusive, but always suggestive and underlining the drama subtly.After seeing this movie, anyone hearing Carl Orff Carmina Burana's Deres Luna will forever associate it with courage, rebirth sacrifice and redemption.Anyone seeing this movie will be moved to believing that one day Arthur may indeed return to redeem us all.

178,Erik G.,A spellbinding fantasy,7,18 February 1999,"I must disagree with a previous comment.  I actually enjoyed the PG version more.  This movie was made at a time when being graphic with violence and sex was considered 'en vogue' and frankly in this movie it only serves to distract because of it's excessiveness.  There is so much more to this movie, but all anyone seems to remember is the gore and the rape in plate mail.  Boorman tried too hard to provide stark images to contrast the beauty of Camelot.  Excalibur doesn't need it, it provides the contrast anyway. With that said, this is a great film.  It is heavy with poetic themes, and music of Wagner and Orff are used perfectly with the imagery--unforgettable. The performances are occasionally overdone, but this is because most of the actors Boorman used were used to the theater, so this is forgivable.  The whole movie is emotionally charged and intense from beginning to end, not one moment is wasted.  But even more, it is complex and intellectually challenging.  Various themes and parallels exist in the story, too many to list:  The Dragon, the Celtic idea of the King and the Land, Merlin and Excalibur, the rise of Christianity.  This movie bears more resemblance to the pre-Christian myths of the Celtic god Artur than to the later Christianizations of these stories, which demoted him to a king.  In fact Christianity was given very little attention in the story, which I think was a good move, giving the story a more primordial feel.  Overall, I enjoyed this movie very much (sans all the unnecessary gore/sex that so many people can't seem to live without) and will watch it again and again.",Excalibur
179,avezou1,"Not good, not bad, just... boring.",4,12 April 2002,"With such a talented director and such an evocative story, I think ""Excalibur"" should have much, much better. Everything is not bad yet: costumes and fight scenes are credible, the movie conveys pretty well the (supposed) barbary of that era and the dreamlike interludes are interesting efforts in attempting to give another dimension to the story.Alas, the hitches are far more numerous and decisive: no character development, no dramatic intensity, poor acting, poor special effects... It made me think of a comic. The movie is very long too, at least considering what it has to say: basically, nothing.What was the point of J.

180,raop74,Only Monty Python's Quest For the Holy Grail is funnier than this film,7,26 March 2002,"I like movies and books about Arthurian tales, because these tales contain so many of the elements that people find fascinating (adventure, good vs. evil, romance...).  Excalibur is an interesting interpretation of the Legend of King Arthur.  Interesting because much of the film is unintentionally funny, generally when director John Boorman was actually aiming for a serious moment.  Granted, the movie was made in the early part of the 80s, so it's aged slightly better than many of the other fantasy flicks of that era.  I do find the ""fuzzy light"" look of the film rather annoying, though I guess it suits the soft porn moments that Boorman insisted on including.The movie score, which has Richard Wagner's works (Wagnerian operas in Arthurian times? Who knew!), is a surprisingly good fit.  The movie's cast is generally suitable, though there are a few duds (Liam Neeson is truly awful here).  Some of the lines in this film are also silly, which is where the unexpected laughs come in (SPOILERS AHEAD!).  An example of a hilarious line is in a scene with Uther Pendragon and Merlin (our famous wizard).  Uther, who would become the father of Arthur, is besotted with Igrayne, the wife of another lord.  With Merlin's magic, he goes to the lord's castle one foggy evening so he can be with Igrayne (the future mother of Arthur).  My favorite line is stated when Uther Pendragon is told by Merlin to cross the sea to the castle.  Uther expresses doubt about riding his horse across the open sea, but Merlin exclaims, ""Ride! Your lust shall hold you up!!"" Totally unexpected, totally ludicrous.The movie is full of strange/funny lines like this, but others are quite beautiful and profound.  The movie would be awful without the incredibly talented Nicol Williamson, who plays the slightly mad but very shrewd Merlin.  He redeems what would otherwise be a campy movie. If only he had more screen time in the film, as he deserved. But much like his brief appearances, the film ultimately leaves us unsatisfied.",Excalibur
181,dgriggs6,"A wonderful, epic movie",10,7 October 2010,"I can't believe this movie is now 29 years old. I found the character of Merlin to be the most captivating, not Arthur, especially when he did his chant of ""Ahnal nathrac, uthas bethude, dothiel dienbay (spelling?)."" And what really made this movie so memorable for me was the incredibly beautiful background music. If you ever get a chance to see this movie in a movie theatre, go see it!! Especially if it has surround sound. And some of the special effects are terrific, too, especially after Arthur has a bit of rejuvenation and leads his knights on horseback, and the landscape magically changes from dreary to green and blooming as he passes by. Helen Mirren was a luscious babe back then who did a wonderful job portraying Morgana ... now she is 65 years old. By the way, if you have seen neither this movie nor Monty Python and the Holy Grail (which was released in the 1970s, before this movie), see this movie first, then Holy Grail. The latter has an incredibly hilarious scene early on in which Arthur meets some peasants who start reciting socialist dogma to him.

Carl Orff was a good choice as well), some beautiful cinematography and sets (some scenes almost take my breath away, like when The Sword is thrown into the water), imagination (I've never seen intercourse in full armor before), and a great story.Unfortunately, it also has some bad casting (who in the world picked Cherie Lunghi to play Guenevere?--flower child as mythological queen? They could have done better by Lancelot as well), a few not so great lines, and, worst of all, the pacing is often too frenetic. If one is going to film the entire Arthurian legend, there is no way you can squeeze it into 2 hours and 20 minutes--not and have coherence. Some have said it was too LONG, and I can understand why they might come to that conclusion--so many scenes, so much plot thrown at us, that for some it must have had a dulling effect. The mind can only absorb so much in 2 & 1/3 hours. So cut it down so there isn't SO much to take in. Understandable, but the wrong remedy. It should have been extended by at least an hour, giving us more time to appreciate all the beauty, all the personalities (Merlin could have used more screen time, and some of the Knights could have stood further development), all the carnage, all the story in this film. Still, the good out weighs the bad by a considerable amount, imho. I can't help feeling disappointed, though. Just a few changes and we would be talking about the film in the same breath as ""Casablanca,"" ""Vertigo,"" or ""The Third Man."" Too bad. We could always use another masterpiece.

183,avidnewbie,A Vivid Dream..,8,7 December 2014,"I remember sneaking to watch this movie from behind the couch when I was a child. I was completely blown away. The armor, the swords, the magic. The brief nudity. This has always been one of my favorite films. There have been many other official adaptations and even a few good rip offs but this is the definitive version of Camelot. In this film King Authur was a real person with a real conscious. He broke the sword in a bout of jealous pride , admitted his folly and immediately displayed a level of humility that made him beloved by all. Of the many iconic images to be found in the film there are a few that I will never forget. Such as the lady of the lake reaching up out of the water to grasp Excalibur's hilt or the image of Mordred, clad in his brilliant gold armor, galloping defiantly upon his steed or when Merlin calls upon the dragon to trans-morph the former king's identity. A must see. A must own.",Excalibur
184,howlandowl,Dismal. Never has a director been so appropriately surnamed.,2,18 May 2000,"Not so much one bad movie as three or four bad movies haphazardly stuck together, Excalibur lurches from one embarrassing and baffling scene to the next. Terrible dialogue, bad acting, laughably inappropriate theme music, and a special effects department that thinks that enough fog can make anything look good (they're wrong). Gee, how could one possible resist this?",Excalibur
185,matthewpr06,Simply the Best,10,19 May 2008,"Basically Excalibur is a contemporary retelling of Arthurian legend. The cast is an exceptionally strong ensemble of Anglo-Irish talent like Patrick Stewart, Helen Mirren, Gabriel Byrne, Liam Neeson and Nicol Williamson. It's also got an epic feel to it (not surprising given the source material) with a lengthy running time and a plot that spans decades.I don't think it's that outlandish to say that this film was Boorman's labour of love, it's very well crafted; sumptuous cinematography, lavish sets, lean dialogue, brilliant music (various Wagner efforts performed by the London Philharmonic) and a range of interesting characters that each has an arc that develops in tandem with the story.Tonally the film (purposefully) wanders wildly from darkness to light; the acts are very clearly defined; first the Kingdom is established and flourishes; which leads to betray and the emergence of evil in the second, then in a blistering third act there is a muted sense of forgiveness and resolution. The first act is very entertaining and full of familiar stories (the Sword in the Stone & the Knights of the Round Table) the second act where Lancelot and Guinevere get their rocks off is all about the melodrama and the third act is a searing blend of startling imagery, fierce battles, sorcery and redemption that really does mark out Excalibur as an extraordinary piece of cinema.There are some amazing moments that stick in the mind; the opening ""teaser"" (for want of a better word) in which Merlin counjours up the dragons breath so Uther Pendgragon can ride across a great expanse of nothingness to bed his rivals wife and play his part in creating the future King. Perceval's search for the grail through a nightmarish vision of medieval Britain, the bright red sun setting over the body strewn ground as Arthur and Mordred face off against each other in a brutal and bloody embrace....Overall, all the ingredients of a great film are present and accounted for, and I'm sure there are plenty of people out there who have never seen or heard of this movie but who, should they ever see it, may actually end up loving it almost as much as I do.",Excalibur

187,SnorriGodhi,A great piece of wisdom in an otherwise uneven movie,9,30 June 2009,"Excalibur includes the single greatest piece of wisdom I found in any movie. This is the exchange between Arthur and Merlin, about 1/3 of the way through. I quote from the ""memorable quotes"" section of IMDb:Arthur: Where hides evil in my kingdom, then? Merlin: Always... where you never expect it. Always. (One does not need to read Nassim Taleb's The Black Swan to appreciate this wisdom, but it helps.)Merlin's wisdom is highlighted, ironically, by his own failure to heed it: pretty soon, Merlin is trapped by an enemy whom he took to be a friend. We all delude ourselves that we are wise, that evil hides where _other people_ do not expect it; but evil actually hides where _we_ do not expect it.There is really no need to say anything more, except to draw a balance sheet. The modifications and simplifications of the original legends are sometime annoying and perhaps unnecessary, but the movie captures the mysterious, haunting aura of the legends. There are some unforgettable scenes, but other scenes are over-the-top. The acting is not always top-notch, but Merlin is outstanding. The soundtrack is very well chosen, especially the Carmina Burana, but also the Wagner pieces (I'll never be a Wagner fan, but his music works very well here). On the whole, the movie is a bit uneven, and I have made it clear what I consider to be the high point.",Excalibur
188,greenman-06994,"""My Kingdom for a Can-Opener...!""",10,5 April 2021,"That was a snipped from Playboy's ""Sex in the Cinema"" section talking about a scene early on in the movie.Seriously though, this is still (One Man's Opinion) the BEST ""King Arthur"" movie and that is saying a lot.While many King Arthur stories make good movies - such as ""Sword of the Valiant"" - the ""Arthurian Mythos"" itself is an immersive set of stories that really can not be turned into a movie for a modern audience. In the legit ""Auld Days"" a master bard would entertain a noble lord (or a rich merchant) for a week or two weeks to provide the whole experience - usually during the winter months. That was similar to the ""Robin Hood"" story.In short while plenty of King Arthur stories make excellent movies - even fictions set in his era - such as ""Prince Valiant"" do well - a solid 2.5 hour at most movie for a modern audience...? I'd rather try to film DUNE. Save perhaps ""Camelot"" there was no real attempt to do this because beyond the logistical nightmare most children had grown up with stories of King Arthur and his Knights. The other film - ""Camelot"" was mostly about the romance between Arthur and Guineviere, again an aspect of the Arthurian legends and had much more time than a modern movie does.The modern ""Politically Correct"" aka ""Social Justice"" aka ""Woke"" era has had lowered educational standards and an outright attack on western civilization so very few have any idea beyond perhaps knowing the name on King Arthur. This is why they try to make films that encapsulate it but fail. ""First Knight"" was a noble try, but...This movie is the exception. It does almost criminally skip over King Arthur's origins and reign+downfall - but it truly captures the spirit of them. I don't want to go over a bunch of scenes and make a spoiler but as one who read those old tales I loved this movie much more than any since and I've watched about all of them - gagging at recent ones.My recommendation:Do NOT re-make this movie.Watch it.And read the legit King Arthur stories. Public domain, can find with a search.For a new movie - try to support making ""Camelot 3000"" into a movie. That as a movie would capture the spirit, have many refs to Arthurian mythos to inspire people to look him up and be very entertaining with even some progressive themes rammed in for the 'woke'...",Excalibur
189,dylankielman,A great adaptation of Le Morte d'Arthur,9,11 April 2005,"When I saw Excalibur about twenty years ago I thought it was one of the greatest films ever. Now with Lord of the Rings and Braveheart this film I think has lost some of its finesse it use to have but it's still a great film. Now the plot to this film rather accurately follows the Arthur legend as in ""Arthur's father dies, he impaled Excalibur into a stone. Arthur pulls sword from stone. Arthur becomes king of Camalot,the knights of the round table is formed."" You get the idea. But I think the one redeeming quality of this film are the sound effects and music, every sound of a sword hitting armor,or a spear puncturing metal is extremely vibrant and realistic.The music in this film I could write an entire review on but to summarize the music as being ""if Lord of the Rings was done in the Eighties."" Overall Excalibur is the perfect film to watch if you want an old fashioned Eroll Flynn style movie with plenty of character development and action.Overall 9.1/10",Excalibur
190,roofusdc,A pleaser,10,9 March 2006,"This isn't a perfect movie. But it sure is a crowd pleaser. Whenever it's on TV I can't help but watch it. The cast is really stunning. This movie is not exactly star-studded as much as stars-to-be-studded. Look for future stars throughout the film. Gabriel Byrne appears in one of his first film roles. Liam Neeson's role as Gawain is one of his first movie roles. Look out for future TV and Film superstar Patrick Stewart in the role of Leondegrance. Helen Mirren chews up the scenery as Morgana. She's one of the real pleasures in this film. That being said, even the minor parts are played with such great force and clarity -- no one goes subtly. John Boorman is to be applauded for making a great film telling an age old story.",Excalibur
191,Hecate-3,Best Camelot/Arthur Movie I've Seen,7,27 July 1999,"This retelling of King Arthur's and Camelot's legend is an adult movie that will not appeal to those looking for a dainty, sugar-coated period piece that is a slavish recreation of Le Morte d'Arthur, but the film is worth watching if you can take the graphic violence and sensuality.  The music tends to be heavy and ponderous except for the delightful number played for Igrayne's dance, and the acting is dramatic, but these things are inevitable given the story.  On the whole, the cast retains interest and sympathy.  A notable flaw is the number of battle scenes that look staged - though the gore looks real enough, but the gruesome battle between Arthur and Mordred at the end makes up for any earlier shortcomings by sheer emotional impact.The film's storyline strays from Le Morte d'Arthur, but Sir Thomas Malory also wrote his own original work that was based on old myths and legends, so Boorman and Pallenberg deserve recognition for making new contributions. None of the actors had the appearance I expected for their characters (except for Sir Kay), but that made it possible for them to redefine their roles.  Nicol Williamson's atypical Merlin who blends wisdom and humor in equal measure is the real star of the show.But the film's triumph is how it balances realism and fantasy, how it manages to capture a hint of the harshness and brutality of a primitive age while retaining the romance and idealism now associated with the ancient myths of King Arthur.  Excalibur has the magic of the old legends and a freshness all its own.  It is a stirring tale of war, lust, revenge, duty, honor, and the power of hope.Recommended.",Excalibur
192,vhsiv,"A great film, one of my all-time faves...",9,27 January 2004,"Before we had Peter Jackson to interpret our 'modern' fairy-tales, and wire-work to negate the effects of gravity, we had John Boorman's 'Excalibur'. Not to deride all of the CGI fans, there *was* a way to do things in the days before computer-generated SFX. That said, this film still holds substantial amounts of water, more than 20 years after it was filmed.I'm one of those feebs who never managed to read all of the Tolkien books (one only), but I've read no fewer than 4 versions of Mallory's 'Mort D'Arthur' as a teenager and musty college English Literature student. *This* is the film that always did it for me. The script, the cinematography and the performances are all top-notch, especially with the many off-center characterizations, Nigel Terry's Merlin being the most outstanding.The other notable thing about this film is it's relative *lack* of slickness: These days, anybody who rides a horse or wields a sword in a film is ninja-graceful - not so here. I'm not so sure you could classify this as realism per se, but Yuen Wo Ping (The Matrix) was *not* the fight choreographer, and nobody associated with the Chinese Opera School had anything to do with this production. Rather, Boorman embraces the fact that anyone who straps on a couple hundred pounds of armor and tries to fight on top of a horse with 30 pound weapons *isn't* going to be the most graceful or coordinated bloke around. This kind of 'realism' is both admirable and refreshing.So, if you're in the mood for a swords-and-sorcery film without all of the slickness, an engaging (and faithful) storyline and more than a bit of 'creative anachronism', this film is well worth checking out.8/10",Excalibur
193,gino_monaco,Hands down greatest version of King Arthur,10,11 July 2012,"This truly is hands down the greatest version of King Arthur and the Knights of the round table i have ever seen. I loved everything about this film, the costumes, the cinematography, the story arch, the settings, the lighting, the colors, the mood, the violence, the sex, and most of all the music is the most epic of all time. I dare anyone to name me a film that has better music for an epic film.I've watched this film since i was a little kid, and it holds a special place in my heart. The more i watch this film over the years, the more i wish i felt more movies were like it. This film is never boring, even when there's no violence or sex taking place. Why? Because the film maker allows the story to develop and make us care what is going on with our characters. A key ingredient that has been missing from modern day films. That's why TV is so much bigger than movies now a days. But enough about that, more about the film.After viewing this film, you will feel like you have just taken a full throttle journey through the land of Camelot. Which makes the climax all the more fulfilling. The magic involved is cool and not geeky, the violence is gruesome, as is many of the characters, the sex is sexy, and story is one of the greatest of all time and told in the best way imaginable. This film should be regarded as a classic.",Excalibur

If one has no knowledge of the tale of King Arthur, the Knights of the Round Table, the inscrutable Merlin, this then is the quintessential enlightenment. The acting is beyond excellent. Nigel Terry, King Arthur, wrenched with the pain of kingship, Cherie Lunghi, Guenevere, torn between passion, love and loyalty, Nigel Williamson, Merlin, present and then absent guiding the youthful Arthur in the ways of royalty, Patrick Stewart, as Leon DeGrance, what can I say, it's Patrick Stewart, Helen Mirren, Morgana, jealous, lustful, confused, and Keith Buckley, Uriens, wishing to be loyal but doubtful of the youthful Arthur ,,, The greatness of the casting and acting goes on and on. The scenes, each in itself a picture of the real and surreal. Not to cite a spoiler, but when Uriens 'breaks knee'(genuflexes) in the murky moat, grabs Arthur's hand and declares,'I doubt you no more' to me eclipses all other scenes except for the last fifteen minutes of this epic.This film, a masterpiece, hearkens to one's frailty, vulnerability yet epitomizes the essence of personal strength.

197,howardvause,"Ripping, Gripping... and essential viewing for Python fans!",7,27 August 2009,"It's weird, but watching ""Excalibur"" - John Boorman's rollicking Arthurian epic - you'd swear it was the prime inspiration for ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"". But you'd be wrong. The Python team came up with their movie 6 years BEFORE ""Excalibur""! Monty Python and the Holy Grail (1975) vs. Excalibur (1981).Nevertheless, load up Boorman's chivalrous romp and I guarantee the Knights Who Say Ni (et al.) references will start leaping out at you. It's like a re-make without the jokes. All this may detract from the gravitas of ""Excalibur"", but you'll enjoy no less for that.All the juiciest bits of Malory's Le Morte d'Arthur are squeezed into ""Excalibur"", so while it occasionally feels rushed, the story gallops along with an heroic vigour.But be prepared (especially if re-watching with fond memories); the film has not aged particularly well. The acting style looks stilted, the soundtrack (Wagner, Carl Orff - now genre clichés) is often obtrusive and the script - despite some very quotable bits - is rather patchy.What the heck!

This movie has bloody violence, humor and terror rolled into a great story. We see King Arthur's life story from his conception due to a rape, being taken away by Merlin to be raised, to discovering as a young man he was born to unite Britain, to falling in love, to betrayal by his half sister, to his final battle and death.The actor who portrays Merlin gives the best performance.

I only give it a four because I like Joseph Campbell. The acting (despite Helen Mirrin) was terrible. The sex scenes were even bad. I know what everyone says, this is a mythological film with symbols and meanings way beyond your comprehension, I say I understand all of the symbols and they are cool, but that does not change the fact that this film sucks. This is not a Friday with the girlfriend film, nor am I implying that it is. Merlin was a cheap rip-off of Sir Alec Gunniess and Obi-Wan Kenobi. Merlin is scary, and reminds me of a child pedophile. The fact is this film bored me to tears, and when it was over I cried with joy. I watched this in a Mythology class, and almost fell asleep. Even the teacher admitted it sucked, but as I said the Mythological importance of this film is very important. If you are looking for an ancient knight war movie, please do not watch.

203,darkharvey123,Great air of mystery,8,28 January 2007,"Along with Ken Russell, John Boorman can be seen as a key figure in the modern British cinema... His interest in myth, dream, landscape and memory may be compared with that of Resnais, Leone, and Roeg...Boorman's 'Excalibur' is characterized by his use of jealousy and adultery, sex and sorcery... It is also characterized by fire and fog, shadow and moonlight, creating an air of mystery that is essential element in the Arthurian legend...Boorman's 'Excalibur' is a mythical presentation leading the viewers to travel with the flow of the legend... It is a magical story with wonderful exotic sets, and interesting camera-work in the lush green scenery of Ireland... (The Cinematography won an Academy Award Nomination).Boorman's ""Excalibur"" is both fantasy and philosophy... Love seems to be a destructive force, lyrically beautiful and bravely realistic...The film brings to life the fateful story of a solitary hero, his ascension to the throne, the love triangle of Camelot, the quest for the Holy Grail, the decline and eventual fall of Arthur and Camelot... Along for the ride are his indispensable Knights of the Round Table, particularly Sir Lancelot...The characters in Boorman's ""Excalibur"" are extremely well developed... Arthur is seen as a naive squire, who develops into an idealistic king... Arthur tries to use Might for the establishment of Right, and according to his own laws, he puts reason over love...A prominent figure in the film is Merlin... He lives backwards, which makes him ""a dream to some, a nightmare to others."" He defines the cave of the dragon as a place where all things meet their opposite: ""The future and the past, desire and regret, knowledge and oblivion"". But when Morgana pronounces ""love"", one would expect Merlin to answer ""hate"", but he just says: ""O yes."" Morgana knows that Uther and Merlin are responsible for the death of her father... She dedicates her life to revenge.. Her scenes with Merlin are full of fire and poison... When she steals the ""charm of making"" from Merlin, Morgana gets stronger... We feared her lines when she affirmed: ""I can ease your loneliness."" Lancelot looks at himself as a sinful person who has betrayed a friend... He stays lonely in the forest, haunted by sorrow and pain... He dreams of a fight with himself... And when he wakes up naked, he sees his own sword stuck in his side... The film endures and inspires because it embodies mankind's deepest yearnings...Among the many elements that make the movie work is the cast: Nigel Terry, the rightful King who, accidentally, removes the sword of power easily, not once, but twice; Helen Mirren, the enchantress Morgana, Merlin's nemesis and Arthur's treacherous half-sister, who seduces Merlin, and then encircles him in a stream of vengeance; Nicholas Clay, persuasively ardent and athletic as the First Knight; Cherie Lunghi, the damsel in distress who loves her husband with her mind and Lancelot with her heart; Nicol Williamson, the wily Merlin who would see that the young Arthur receive the necessary training and guidance to fulfill his unlikely destiny; Gabriel Byrne, the hot-blooded Uther Pendragon, who plunges 'Excalibur' deep into a stone rock in one last act of defiance; Katrine Boorman, the woman taken as by a fully armored King; Liam Neeson, the knight who dares to accuse the Queen; and Robert Addie, the 'unholy child' who comes to Camelot to demand the throne of his father...One of the more fascinating aspects of the film (and there are many...) are the differences between Uther and Arthur... King Uther is unable to master his instincts... His world is confusion, disorder, and unlimited passion... The characteristic developments of Arthur occur as he faces the trials of his life... The knowledge of the affair yet his love for his beautiful wife and best friend wage war inside of his mind... When he sees Guinevere in the arms of Lancelot, he stuck 'Excalibur' between them loosing his connection to the extraordinary powers of Merlin and the Lady of the Lake...John Boorman's films frequently concern contradictions and polarities, tensions between nature and civilization, dream and reality... Equally, his career as a whole swings violently between success and failure, intelligent ambition and pretentiousness...",Excalibur

This is probably one of the, if not the best movie about King Arthur ever made. I have seen a bunch of movies about King Arthur and none come close to this version. This one smokes all others out of the water. There are some stories from King Arthur that didn't make it into this movie, but considering all the material they had to cover, I think they did a great job. I loved Nicole Williamson, Helen Mirren was riveting as a sexy Morgana and Nigel Terry was awesome, playing Arthur from boy to manhood. And the soundtrack is especially stirring.

This was a load of garbage and either shot in some foreign country, which is the usually why a film sucks, or done on such a low budget that they could neither employ good actors or they had promised parts to their backers kids.

207,Lloyd-23,A beautiful translation of a legend into sound and light.,10,11 October 1999,"More people telling me their favourite film, have named Excalibur, than have chosen any other film.  People tend to feel strongly about this film.  I can remember that when it came out, a film magazine reviewed it twice, feeling that it had to do so, since its two reviewers had such contrasting opinions. In short, people who don't adore it, tend to hate it.Those who hate it have failed to understand something very important: that it is set in the land of dreams.  Excalibur makes no attempt to be realistic.  It is the film of a legend, and it tries to create a world of legend, and it succeeds.  Once one has realised that this is not the real world, then the film is internally consistent and works splendidly. Merlin, towards the end of the film, even says the line ""Your love brought me back to where you are: in the land of dreams.""  If anything, this makes the film even more tragic, because all of Arthur's sufferings have been not for his world, but for ours.The Arthurian legend is probably the world's best legend.  It has been told a thousand different ways, but is so strong, that no retelling can harm it. The story is familiar, but this telling of it is not.  The screen starts blank, with the distant drums of Seigfried's Funeral March playing, and after a few captions, the curtain lifts to reveal a stunning opening sequence with horses breathing fire-lit breath into the night air, as Uther's men do battle with those of the Duke of Cornwall.  The armour is dark, and greenish, and the movements slow, making this seem like a scene of battling dinosaurs.  It is brutal and bloody.  These are the dark ages. This is the time of chaos from which Arthur's kingdom must come.  Into the scene, in a cloud of swirling fog, comes a figure who will be present throughout the film, ageless and mysterious, Nicol Williamson's Merlin, whose voice carries over the din.I remember how suddenly I found myself immersed in this world when I first saw the film, and even now the hairs stand up on the back of my neck thinking about it.  Allow yourself to become  involved with the film, and you will be rewarded.The costumes are magnificent.  Special mention must go to the shining armour, and Morgana's (Helen Mirren) ever-increasingly impressive series of outfits.  The music is stirring (it uses ""O Fortuna"" from Carima Burana before this had become a cliche).  The acting is theatrical and good. Each of these characters is on a stage, to be examined.  This is not a film of quiet intimate moments.  It is a legend, and legends are public.Excalibur distills the Arthurian legends into one film of watchable length very cleverly.  At several points during it, a clever cut tells the viewer that several years have passed.  Single characters represent many things. At one point Sir Percival represents all the questknights, at another Morgana is all that is evil.  In telling the story quickly, the film uses simple direct speeches.  In one scene, Arthur visits Guinevere, the woman he loved deeply, whom he hasn't seen for many years.  He spends just a minute in her company and leaves, and yet the speech he delivers to her is so complete and so moving, that you do not feel robbed.  He says his piece and leaves, needing to say no more.It is true that the film has dated a little.  Some of the hair-styles and special effects are not quite what they would be today, and the quality of the dubbing is not first-rate, but this is still stunning.  Everything seems to have come together to help this film look and sound good.  The skies over the castles are spectacular, the Irish landscape (it was shot there) looks the part.  The visual imagination and daring to have Camelot as a castle literally made from silver, and to have Arthur's final battle fought in fog with a huge blood red sunset behind it, makes this a feast for the eye.I am writing about one of my all-time favourite films.  I cry every time I see the land burst into blossom as a reborn Arthur gallops through it, and I feel the heavy warmth of tragedy as he is carried off towards the sunset to the Isle of Avalon.  I am spoiling nothing by telling you that Arthur dies in the end.  Everyone knows that he dies in the end.  The whole film is leading to that moment.  When you reach the end of the film, ask yourself this: where did he go wrong?  What was it he did to lose his wife, his son, his sister, his best friend, all his questknights, Merlin, his kingdom, his life - everything he held dear?""The one god of the many comes to drive out the many gods.  The spirits of wood and stone grow silent.  It is a time for men and their ways.""  That's it.",Excalibur
208,m_bong1,Unusual spiel,2,16 March 2006,Reading the superlative reviews I decided to give this medieval classic a try. In the beginning I was flummoxed with the acting and stilted one-liners. As the movie progressed I didn't know whether to laugh or take the movie seriously. In the end I decided to watch it like a spoof of Monty Pythons--...Grail..... Some of the characters do resemble them ( well heck!! with the armor on everyone looks alike). Watch it from that angle and its almost funny. else shun it like a leech. The battle scenes are pathetic people die on being touched by anything without any entry of the weapon. I guess Boorman thought that during those days people died of shock of a weapon touching their armor and not of the actual entry of the sword. Merlin is amazingly cheesy ( and he has the best lines) what a pity and waste. Do not be swayed by the obvious adulation as these reviewers have low standards.,Excalibur
209,Jazzcat,Pathetic!,2,13 November 1999,"I will confess right away that I did not watch the entire movie, so maybe it gets 90% better (it would have to to earn that 7.5 rating) after the first 20 minutes, but I seriously doubt it.  The thing that killed this movie for me was the terrible acting, the lame dialogue, and the ridiculous and unbelievable events.  Can a man actually have sex with a woman while wearing full plate armor?  Amazing.  And I was amazed as well to learn that when you thrust a tempered steel broadsword like Excalibur into the ground, it will wobble drunkenly from side to side like it was made from Reynold's Aluminum Wrap.  Then there is the young Arthur, played by some yokel who is so uninvolved in what is happening to him that he might have been sleep-walking.  He is completely blase about pulling Excalibur from the stone.  This is supposed to be a holy, awe-inspiring moment; but judging by his response, he may as well have been shoveling manure.  He takes everything in stride.  He pulls Excalibur from the stone, is taken away from his family, accompanied by a powerful wizard with unknown intentions, and led into a dark medieval forest filled with ""terrifying"" snakes and lizards (some of which migrated from a tropical rain forest -- maybe they were carried there by an African Swallow ;^), yet he has virtually no emotional response to any of this.  Apparently, it's all a normal day in his life.That this movie is supposedly true to the original Arthurian legend is no excuse for its many glaring flaws and poor production quality.  See this only if you are a fanatic about Arthurian legend and have a high tolerance for stupidity.",Excalibur
210,romain-4,One and only one,10,11 June 1999,"Every person has got a ""one and only one film"" in his heart.When I first saw Excalibur, I was 10 years old. It's been an incredible revelation, the revelation that cinema is more important than reality, that a movie can take you a lot more far than anything in this world. It's the film that made me love cinema.To thank John Boorman for what he did for me, I've seen Excalibur at least fifty times and each time I meet someone that has not seen it yet, I take him to the movies and watch Excalibur one more magical time.",Excalibur
211,guajolotl,Historical context for Arthur,10,26 December 2006,"All legends are rooted in some sort of fact. The fascinating thing about Arthur is that he spans the time from 100AD to about 700AD, that is to say, the fall of Rome and the proselytizing by the new Christians into England, where they found witches and rituals as ancient as anything in Persia or Sumer. The first arrivals, according to the 6th-century British writer Gildas, were invited by a British king to defend his kingdom against the Picts and Scots. A tradition reached Bede that the first mercenaries were from three tribes--the Angles, Saxons, and Jutes--which he locates on the Cimbric Peninsula, and by implication the coastlands of northwestern Germany. Archaeology, however, suggests a more complex picture showing many tribal elements, Frankish leadership in the first waves, and Frisian contacts. Revolt by these mercenaries against their British employers in the southeast of England led to large-scale Germanic settlements near the coasts and along the river valleys. Their advance was halted for a generation by native resistance, which tradition associates with the names of AmbrosiusAurelianus and Arthur, culminating in victory about 500 by the Britons at the Battle of Mons Badonicus at an unidentified location. Add to this the psychosexual elements, incest, homosexuality (I am convinced Arthur, Guenevere and Lancelot were a menage a trois, although not at the same time) the economic and moral crisis of a system that had played itself out, an almost Christ-like feeling of betrayal, death and resurrection, and you have a story as compelling as anything told by Homer.",Excalibur
212,youngjedi,A Grand Spectacle,10,14 January 2001,"Excalibur is a masterpiece, simply put.  It dazzles us, excites us, even makes us cry.  Not only does it fully realize the Arthurian legends in film format, but is a great work of art on its own.  A huge, gifted cast brings to light the memorable characters of Camelot, and chief among them is Nicol Williamson, who will forever be Merlin.  The set design is awesome, with detailed armor and accurate medieval weaponry.  But best of all, it treats the Arthurian legend with maturity.  While I don't believe that sex and violence makes a movie, the Arthurian legends are FULL of sex and violence, and too often that is compromised to make it more mainstream and marketable to kids.  Finally, the legend as it should be.  If you love sword and sorcery and haven't seen Excalibur go rent (or buy) it now.",Excalibur

It is nice to see Patrick Stewart and Liam Neeson in a film together before they got famous.",Excalibur
214,bojopm,A great tribute to Britain,10,5 July 2020,"This film goes out of it's way to prove to the viewer that British women are the sexiest type of women in the world, with men such as King Arthur's Father willing to go to war purely to have sex with British women like King Arthur's Mother. The film clearly shows how appreciative British people are to have such good lucks and clearly explains why Brits scoff at the looks of other ethnicities. Due to this film I have lovely adventures every day looking for the lovely Lady of the Lake, looking to seduce her and cuddle with her and tell her everything is going to be okay as I love her so very much, as I gently cradle the ExCalibur sword when I eventually find that too.These epic adventures and quests that I have probably wouldn't have been possible without this film so for that I'm very grateful and I'm just going to flick some wet soggy cheese that's wedged in between my toes at my computer screen as an appreciative gesture towards this lovely website. GOOD LUCK BRITS!",Excalibur
215,scttwortman,Stealth Wagner,9,1 April 2001,"I saw this movie on opening day,1981.It enthralled and depressed me a little at the same time,and I could never figure out why....till now.I am an Arthurian buff without being a fanatic.I have ""Knights of the Round Table"",""Sword of Lancelot"",""Excalibur"",even the obscure""Young Arthur,Warlord""[from british TV.] I've read Tennyson,Mallory,and Steinbeck.I've read historians who have pursued the authentic Arthur. After reading the many comments on this site,I slapped it on again today.Those remarks praising the use of Wagner's music as used in the film were just a little off the mark.This whole film is Wagner minus the arias.Richard would have loved this!There is a near cultish devotion to the nobility of barbarism in it's purest form.Lancelot was heroic ,literally till the armor came off.If Boorman hadn't thrown in the occasional reference to justice for everyone I believe Hitler himself would have financed this film.This is close to Aryan mysticism [without the Aryans].I'm surprised Boorman mellowed to the point he could make ""Hope and Glory"".Aside from the Wagnerian fatalism,I still love this film! Forget the 14th century plate armor,17th century saddles,and polo ponies with polo bridles.This is still the best Arthur to date!![And if you think this film is long and covers too much ;read Mallory.]",Excalibur
216,kirk_williams,decent retelling of Mallory's tale,5,30 October 2002,"Hmmm, not a bad movie by any means, but not great either. Your basic retelling of the entire Arthur legend, which does get a bit confusing at times. Definitely helps to bone up on Thomas Mallory's version before viewing. Of course, it also includes the requisite early-80's cheese: rather unappealing sex scenes, cartoonish gore, etc. That being said, it's not bad in a ""I hate myself for wasting 2 and a half hours of my life"" kind of way, but it lacks flow. It also glosses over alot of details, but that's to be expected, I suppose. Boring at times, as well. Basically, if you're into Arthurian stuff, check it out.",Excalibur
217,elandyll,One of the greatest Epic Medieval Fantasy movies of our times,10,22 November 2004,"Adapted from one of several versions of the King Arthur's legends, John Boorman's iteration takes us to a world of Sword and Sorcery in Mystical England. The film opens with Uther, father of Arthur, showing us how lust can deprive a man of his senses, all the while Merlin is trying to finally find the King to unite England. The rest of the story, Morgane, Mordred, Knights of the round table, Lancelos's and Guinevere betrayal, is fairly standard but told in a powerful way. The images are sublime and the musical score (Carmina Burana) matches those perfectly. It is by far -imho- Boorman's best movie, and it truly is one of the great classics from the 80's. It will probably stay as the most impressive Arthurian Legends adaptation for a loooong time.Maybe until Peter Jackson decides to do a remake in fact :)",Excalibur

Credit goes of course to the great story and presentation. First off, the costumes , music, lighting and set design look quite epic and otherwordly.It is a great adventure movie that features a good blend of drama, romance & gritty action. Wish it had some more philoshical musings, and also wished it was a bit longer. Some characters like Merlin and Morgaine are being very underused during a good portion of the film. Especially the last third of the move felt a bit rushed compared to the steady and slow pace of the majority of the film.I enjoyed all of the actors, escially Nigel Terry gives such a great charismatic performance of young Arthur to elder Arthur.",Excalibur

It's got some plot gaps, some overacting, but it aims high and achieves the myth it's aiming for.  Nicol Williamson is simultaneously disturbing and engaging as an over-the-top Merlin, but it works.  Arthur is a total straight man, but with a human touch that breaks the 2-D mold and also works.  The plot is rich, vibrant, and evocative.  And the soundtrack is lush and perfect.For those looking for a faithful adaptation of any of the myths, don't look here.  But for a good movie, you can't go wrong.",Excalibur

Arthur and the land are one, and when he thrives, the land will, too.This movie will always be in my top 10 favorite movies of all time list!Note: Two versions of the film do exist - an 'R' rated version and a 'PG'.

223,kayper54,Didn't improve with age,5,4 December 2010,"I first saw this in a theater when it came out, when I was too young to be seeing it. Thus, it went a bit over my head, I thought. I couldn't really put it together and it made almost no impression on me at all. So when I thought about it again recently I figured I'd try watching it now that I'm grown. It was evidently supposed to be an excellent film; the 7.4 rating here indicated it couldn't be horrible.It's not horrible, but it does suffer from really bad and stilted writing leading to campy over-acting from actors I know for a fact are excellent actors. I still love Patrick Stewart and Helen Mirren in anything I see them in, this film included. But I got the impression the director wanted the actors to all channel Shakespeare and though they tried courageously, the script failed them miserably. It didn't make any impression on me back then because, well, there was no good impression to make.Its music is not even its own, which for a film of this size and scale would be unthinkable today. If there is any original music in it, it's barely noticeable. I thought this would have been a perfect vehicle for John Williams, but he was busy on Raiders of the Lost Ark at the time. I wonder how much better this film would have been if he'd scored it.It sounds as if the entire movie was looped in-studio, and very badly.It is wonderful to look at. The scenery is lush. The darkness and gore are glamorous and the light and beauty are sparkling and lovely. It was fun spotting the younger bit-players, some of whom are now huge, international stars. I loved a young Liam Neeson as a drunk Sir Gawain in the accusation scene at the round table. I appreciate Nicol Williamson's attempt to insert humor into a character who was not written particularly humorously. Charley Boorman was an appropriately creepy-looking little dude at that age. Helen Mirren is, of course, gorgeous as always, but spends a good part of the film with her right hand resting high on her left shoulder for some odd reason. Some of the knights sport some truly bizarre hairstyles. I actually liked Nigel Terry's and Paul Geoffrey's performances. But in the end I found myself both wondering how much better Peter Jackson could have made this film, and feeling very relieved that John Boorman's plans to film The LOTR failed.",Excalibur

Also all the actors seem to be unknowns, so one can really concentrate on the character and not have any foolish thoughts on someone famous.

229,mdana,Best Arthurian Film,10,14 June 2002,"Ok.  I haven't seen any others so, maybe that is faint praise.  However, it is in my top 20 of all-time and I have seen thousands of movies.  I would like to comment on some of the other comments I have read here about Excalibur as much as the movie itself.  Someone mentioned the music was ""ok"".  It's freakin Wagner!!! It is fabulous for this movie.  I don't think a composer alive or at the time of the movie's release (1981) could have created a better original score for the movie.  I think Wagner is used better here than in the chopper scene in Apocolypse Now and that is high praise indeed, because that is one of the most magnificent scenes in all of film. You like action?  You like fantasy, sex, or blood?  Well this is the movie for you.  I don't understand what all the fuss is about the sex.  It is integral to the plot.  Uther's lust destroyed the peace and provided the seed that became Arthur.  Arthur' betrayal by Guinevere and Lancelot leads him to be seduced by his half-sister Morgana and impregnate her with Mordred his eventual death sentence.  Thankfully, the scenes are erotic and beautifully filmed in stark contrast to the dark and grim life these people lead when not killing. The acting is pretty good as far as I am concerned.  I loved Nicol Williamson's Merlin, he is hilarious and eccentric.  Helen Mirren's Morgana is sexy and evil.  Paul Geoffrey's Perceval ages like 20 years in about 25 minutes and is quite believable.  The Boorman family is quite good especially Katrine Boorman as Igrayne (she dances and heaves very well). Her sister Telsche Boorman was the Lady of the Lake and her brother was young Mordred who taunts Perceval. The movie is beautifully lit and has many powerful scenes and images that other better known movies cannot match.  I am amazed at the power Boorman was able to capture in many scenes especially the Lady of the Lake, the Last battle, and sunrise boat farewell. Maybe the most amazing thing is how Boorman got so much action and story into so little time (around 2hrs and 15 minutes).  He tells the stories of Uther, Merlin, Arthur, Mordred, Morgana, Perceval, Lancelot, and Guenevere, when a single story about any one of them could make up a 90 minute movie. Some in this forum have bitched about the short strokes he makes in characterizations, but he is very deft at telling you enough to push the story along.  If you want to know more about a specific character, go read a book about that character.  Don't expect to find it all here.  Especially a secondary character like Morgana (who is important, but the name of the movie is excalibur, woman will take a backseat in this phallic world, thank you very much). I cry at the end of this movie everytime I see it and part of the reason is because I am sad at the death of Arthur who legend or not was a great man. The other reason is because this is almost perfection in film and it is rarely achieved and it deserves to be appreciated.  This is what movies are all about loss, power and redemption, all filmed in breathtaking beauty.",Excalibur
230,bjmilhist,A beautiful retelling of the Arthurian myth,10,6 June 2002,"I believe that Excalibur is the very best Arthurian film.  It is a brilliant retelling of the Arthurian legend and it gets the story right--he is the once and future king, a messianic figure.  Boorman beautifully captures the myth.  Spoilers:  Furthermore, a line that Sean Connery delivered in Zardoz dully and ineffectively is delivered by Helen Mirren to great effect in this film--you really believe that Morgana wants Merlin's knowledge so badly that she will sacrifice herself.  And the ending works so well, you believe in Arthur.  The ship heads toward Avalon, somewhere toward the setting sun, to the West.  And I love the music, Wagner works so well in this film.

It pares the Malory epic down to its basic core and recreates an entire fantastic world--the myth of Arthur, not the historical reality of Arthur. It suceeds magnificently.  If you love fantasy you will love Excalibur. Furthermore, the music is divine:  Siegfried's Funeral March (the sword's motif), more Wagner (Lohengrin and Parzival), plus the Carmina Burana.

233,movie-enthusiast,The Dream Is Realized - On Screen,9,30 June 2011,"It is the best film ever made about The Arthurian Legend and is likely to remain so. Sir Thomas Malory would love this film.This fantasy spectacle is extremely well done. The picturesque renaissance-style armor is very romantic and Pre-Raphaelite. Though the armor is not of ""Arthur's time"", one could not imagine these knights wearing anything else.There is clanking and banging of sword against sword, sword against armor, and men wearing armor riding around on horses wearing armor. There is armor everywhere! Perhaps hundreds of suits of armor were made for the film.And the costumes are beautiful... Flowing gowns and dazzling jewelry (Why don't women dress like this all the time?). The Lady of the Lake is perfectly depicted in the Pre-Raphaelite style.By the way, if you are a Helen Mirren fan, she has never looked better and believe me she is dressed to kill.One cannot imagine a Merlin that is not Nicol Williamson nor a Morgana that is not Helen Mirren after seeing this. They were terrific. (Their chemistry on screen was aided by a personal feud going on in real life at the time, according to Boorman.) I'm sure it was a labor of love for the cast. Some other impressive performances were: Paul Geoffrey as Percival, Gabriel Byrne as Uther Pendragon, and Patrick Stewart as Leondegrance.The music in the film is remarkable. Dark and moody classical passages, ethereal vocals, brass fanfares -- all enhance the fantasy.--Personal footnote: This story is basically a pagan myth. Malory's version adds Christian aspects to the story. The saints among the magic and potions of the Druids doesn't really make sense. To take a sword that is empowered by a Druid spell and knight someone in the name of St. George, St. Michael, and God isn't logical. It seems that Christian aspects were imposed on the original story. Some think that Malory was commissioned to Christianize the Arthurian Legend, though there is no proof. I only mention this as an explanation why these things are mixed together. J.R.R. Tolkien stated in an interview that he believed the whole story to be a prank by the French. He also stated that it was one reason why he wrote The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit. In closing, I want to say that no facts will ever get in the way of this story.

The close shot of Arthur's face as he rides through the blossom shedding trees with his Knights in tow and the Carmina Burana score playing is, IMO, one of the greatest in modern cinema. I wonder how many takes it took to do!It is a pure fantasy made fantastically! They don't make 'em like this any more!",Excalibur
238,warlover,A delight,10,11 February 1999,"This version of the Arthur legend is simply a delight to watch. One simply can't help but get caught up in all the magic.  Nicol Wiliamson playes Merlin in such an eerie way that it makes my hair rise.  Nigel Terry portrays Arthur extremely well.  And of course, Gabriel Byrne in the small role of Uther, a far cry from the aging D'Artagnan in The Man in the Iron Mask.  But what really makes this movie is the scenery and the music, there's something very eerie about that music that simply puts the whole show together.  Mordred in his gold armour really looks scary in that dark and mystical time.  If you want to see a movie that you'll probaly have to see many more times, check this version out and prepare for one of the greatest movies ever made.",Excalibur
239,The Realms,One my all-time favorite movies,10,15 September 2000,"Excalibur has to be one of the movie world's most excellent features. I would recommend this film to anyone who enjoys `a good movie'. It is almost 20 years old and I still watch it when I can. I've owned it on videotape and now, on DVD as well. It moves me as much today as the day it hit the theatres here in the states. An awesome movie, good vs. bad, honor and truth... Beautiful sound track too!",Excalibur

Boorman's view of a tragic tale of lust and deception and magic and steel is presented without a message.

241,aabrams,Far better in it's day then people today realize.,8,25 July 2002,"Way back in 1981 I saw this film at the cinema for the first time. It was an incredible experience, in the cinema the mixture of Wagner and powerful (if somewhat violent) images were almost overwhelming. This is not a film that translated so well to television. Much like ""Saving Private Ryan"" the power of the movie is lost on the small screen. None the less this was a firm favourite amongst young British lads for the next 10 years or so. The film is steeped in dark age pagan mysticism and offers an almost ""other worldly"" experience to the viewer. This movie was far more impressive then it's contemporary rival the rather silly (though still enjoyed) Conan the Barbarian. I believe that Excalibur remained easily the best sword and sorcery flick until the 2001 release of Lord of the Rings.",Excalibur

I hadn't seen the film in over 2 decades and decided to watch it again recently.

245,michaelwoods-11911,Greatest Film Ever! A film that should be watched by all Britons!,10,18 August 2019,"As a lovely wild filthy long haired bearded white British Barbarian who lives in the green pleasant forests of the sexy island of Great Britain, this film is a real treat. First of all, I'll just like to say that it's such a great honour that my beloved country's lovely island is the home of the setting of the greatest film in existence and it makes me SO proud to be British. My island is the most beautiful place in the world so that really helps the film look so nice, there was a lot of forests, marshes and meadows in this film so it had such a great level of diversity with it's different landscapes in the film and it just looks so pretty onscreen. Say what you like about the Dark Ages, but they certainly had more forests, there wouldn't have been any dull lifeless modern homes and life would have been visually a lot prettier back then, this film showcases that brilliantly.I also loved the character's accents, it's great to understand them properly in this film as a lot of the time when I watch a random film nowadays it's a silly American accent I can barely understand so watching this makes a lovely change. I really liked the mystery of the film and this film made me more interested in the Anglo-Saxon invasion of Britain during the 5th and 6th Centuries more than any other part of British history. With the lack of much historical documentation of the people, it truly does make me believe that there were probably so much more amazing things that also happened during the time of King Arthur and Merlin which we have no clue about so it gives me plenty of food for thought and the story is just so deep, complex and thought provoking to the extent me and my wife were talking for hours on end about the film after we first watched it together.The film shows the magic of my sexy island wonderfully, Britain is full of enchanted forests and many exotic talking animals and supernatural beasts which I see reasonably often in my rural fun life, ExCalibur showcases the very real phenomenon of wizardry brilliantly with Merlin, it's just a shame magic isn't so common nowadays. The significance of magic in the film gave me a positive attitude on life and made me believe even more that anything's possible and that helps build confidence and also makes me more excited in desolate unexplored places in anticipation of what magical powers I might uncover. Due to that, this film really makes me go out deep into the magical forest and explore, I truly do love exploring especially after seeing all the possibilities of magic in ExCalibur so this film cheers me up whenever I feel bored and depressed,I love violence and gore, this film had plenty of it for me to be happy with and as a result of the frequent lovely exciting violence in the film, it truly get's my love balls stirring so much indeed every time I see it. This film always inspires me to go out hunting which I love and ride my horse really fast, the film really does make me feel less guilty and much more excited when I'm killing my hard-earned prey. The lack of non-white people in the film also makes the whole film so much more connected to my culture than the average film and therefore more meaningful and personal to me when I'm watching it because it gives more things to think about it when there's more thing's in a film which you can relate to.The ExCalibur film is truly sexy, one of my favourite scenes was when Lancelot and Guenevere had sex in a lovely bit of forest hiding the two star struck lovers from the rest of the world. That scene not only showed how beautiful British people can be but it also showed how sexy our island can be as well so it was a brilliant mix of both land and people in that scene to get the viewer at his or her ultimate sexual arousal pretty easily so it's definitely not a film to watch with children around hehe! This film should be compulsory to show this in schools at least once a year to all school years, due to the lack of CGI and great historical telling this film is timeless and will forever stand the test of time.",Excalibur
246,pottedstu,Pointless and confused retelling of Arthurian myth,1,4 January 2005,"Boorman has always been a director more interested in intellectual themes and the play of symbols than in plot, characterisation, action, drama, or the other perks of commercial cinema. Sometimes, as in Point Blank, this produces a film which is austere yet impressive and resonant; at other times, like Zardoz, the result is unintentionally hilarious and leaves the viewer clueless as to the director's intentions.Excalibur falls in the middle. It's not powerful epic film-making, and it's not camp nonsense. It's just dull. Most of the action takes place in near-total darkness, so it is almost impossible to follow the plot even if you can work out which of the million variations of the Arthur myth he's trying to tell. Occasionally Helen Mirren's naked body looms out of the night, which may have been nifty when the film was made but now there are websites for that kind of thing.The cast (mainly not-quite-famous stage actors) don't seem to understand how to put their characters across on film. The cinematography is occasionally pretty, but generally dysfunctional since it fails to serve the needs of plot and character. Even the story itself is poor, demonstrating that the legend of Arthur is less a coherent narrative and more a string of sometimes contradictory events conflating numerous historical figures and folk tales.The film has no discernible intellectual, social or political message, and though it promises the chance to see a record of some good stage actors, the expected performances never materialise through the darkness and mud. The story of Arthur has been presented so many times it's almost impossible to do anything original other than be worse than whatever has come before (as the recent King Arthur demonstrated). Watch Disney's The Sword and the Stone instead.",Excalibur
247,arngest,Entrancing visual opera (very minor spoilers),8,25 June 2004,"There are so many ways to describe this film - enchanting, bombastic, captivating, breathtaking, operatic, yet occasionally silly, uneven, and disjointed. At certain points characters go through emotional extremes in the blink of an eye (such as when Percival suddenly breaks down crying when offered a drink by Morgana), disrupting the otherwise almost poetic flow of the storytelling and visuals. Elsewhere the moments are so powerful as to be addictive (when Arthur slumps against a stone and calls out for his long lost mentor Merlin, I could almost feel the pain and weight of his years on my own shoulders). Perhaps it is best summed up as an example of myth masterfully crafted for the screen, its lyrical power bolstered by its stunning photography and carried along by the Wagnerian score. Despite its hiccups, 'Excalibur' achieves its aim with power, grace, and hypnotic allure.",Excalibur
248,lastaria,The Best of all King Arthur Movies,10,1 March 2010,"No other King Arthur movie has made an impression on me like Excalibur has. No other movie seems to capture the true magic and feeling of myth like this movie.It captures the very essence of the legend we have come to love telling the story true.Unfortunately those of a younger generation (bring 33 at the time of this review I do not consider myself that old myself) who are used to CGI laden and fast paced action may not like this movie. Some may say the acting is a little cheesy or hammy too. It could be taken that way, I would say it is more theatrical in nature which asks for big performances and if you take it as such, then you appreciate the performances all the more.The action may not be on the level modern audiences are used to, however it still givers a good account of itself with plenty of battle scenes to keep you happy.But the real meat of the film is its story. Excellently scripted with subtle and not so subtle devices used to tell the story it does not insult the viewers intelligence leaving the viewer to spot much of the little story devices that lead to later big story plots.If I had anything I would change in the movie, it would be that Sir Gawain had a bigger role and was not just best known for challenging Sir Lancelot in the movie accusing him of desiring Guinivere. In the myths he is one of the finest and most noble of Knights, his own story with the green knight an excellent one. But I guess this would have diverted from the main story which is about Arthur himself.It crams the story into the hour and 40 minutes well, and perhaps would have benefited from another half hour, but they rarely made movies that long back then and it still does a sterling job in the time it has.Overall a great version of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round table. In my humble opinion no other versions come close to this, and I would be surprised if do in the future.",Excalibur

I finally found one store who ordered it for me and now that it is in my collection I am in my happy zone. The script is fantastic, the actors are wonderful and overall it just makes for one extremely well made film.I have seen other versions of the King Arthur legend but none come even close to this version. I do not mind watching my favorite film on a weekly basis because it is that good.

The accents were a mixed bag of classic west-country and RP (recieved pronunciation) with great dialogue and understanding of chivalry. The sex scenes were brutal and yet strangely erotic at times and Merlin is played by N Williamsomn with utter relish but making it really entertaining. The images from Boorman and the use of water as an obsession are extremely well shot and there is fabulous hope in the use of Wagner's music. The battle scenes are realistic and harsh - water, blood and mud mixed together with pain and suffering. Great flick!! Ironduke",Excalibur
253,j-p-porter,A great film - maybe a classic,9,11 June 2015,"I have seen both the heavily edited version (119 minutes) and the extended cut (140 minutes), and the viewer is gypped by the shorter version. Things are left out that are central to the atmosphere of the movie, and for all intents and purposes, this movie depends upon its atmosphere for its full effect to be felt.The settings are from Boorman's own estate in Ireland, and I envy him his property. Again, the atmosphere of the film is central, and the settings make the film a beautiful film to watch.The actors are uniformly excellent in their roles, and it is fun to see some of the faces in this movie and appreciate how their careers would develop - particularly Patrick Stewart, Helen Mirren and Liam Neeson. All three (for whom this was their film debut) have become household names and guaranteed box-office draws.I've watched the film more than a dozen times, and although it no longer thrills me as much as it once did, it still stands up as one of the better movies I've ever seen.",Excalibur
254,guydeleo,Arthur would have found this film treatment artless!,3,7 April 2005,"This film was a dreadful Boor! There was no discernible sense of poetry or wonderment, as there should be in a movie about King Arthur. The acting was wooden and the direction was uninspired. The music was also terribly disappointing. Couldn't the director have commissioned some interesting original scores rather than recycling Wagner and Carl Orff; Carmina Burana is based on 13th century drinking songs. The legend of Arthur deserves better. It has been wonderfully depicted in literature, from Geoffrey of Monmouth in the 12th century through Marion Zimmer Bradley's The Mists of Avalon, a contemporary retelling. Sadly, there has been no credible film version. I suggest you immerse yourself in the literature until a decent movie is made. Or read some of Richard Barber's books (e.g. King Arthur: Hero and Legend).",Excalibur

257,005,Disjointed and Lacking,3,29 January 2000,"*½/****After reading the Arthurian legends in my English class, we were treated to a viewing of the movie Excalibur.  It wasn't much of a treat.  I don't think that 1 movie about Arthur can EVER be really good.  The major problem is that there's way too much to fit in to 2 1/2 or even 3 hours. The only good way is to make a TV miniseries out of them. This forces Excalibur to become too quick paced and disjointed to effectively tell the story.  It rushes going through all the motions of the important stories while missing out on other parts.  Events come flying out of nowhere. One moment Arthur is eating dinner the next he's at a lake and in less than 30 seconds he pisses someone off and starts fighting him.  Then in another 45 seconds, surprise(!), it's Launcelot.  When it takes moments of ACTUAL character development, the acting and dialogue is so bland, it's hard keeping awake and I did fall asleep for 15-20 minutes.  Didn't miss much though.  The whole movie, especially most of the ending ends up like a series of clips they show on TV shows like Leno.  My advice, get off your lazy a** and read a book about them. It's much more satisfying. I know from experience, and usually I hate reading!  You'll get to enjoy stories like Gawain and the Green Knight, Sir Gareth, Knight of the Kitchen, and Sir Tristam and Iseult.  They're great stories that were nowhere to be seen in the movie (although, there'd be no reason to put them in, but, you know).",Excalibur
258,fildapimp,Awesome,10,6 December 1999,"I have seen the movie Excalibur many times, and I believe it is an excellant movie.  Many people say that it was cheezy looking (Yes, Excalibur the sword does get a tad flexible at points.)  However, was not The Day the Earth Stood Still cheezy too, yet it is one of the greatest movies of all times, most people agree.  And if anyone tries to down the movie by claiming it was not true to the legends, I have read many Arthurian texts, and the legend is not true to the legends.  John Boorman picked through the haystack, and found his needle.  Another excellant thing about this movie is for the most part, the acting is underscored.  Not like in many modern movies, I believe Nicol Williamson, Helen Mirren, all the actors from the round table, and Mrs. Boorman did excellant jobs.  The only complaints I had were so minor they practically do not exist.  So go, see the movie, and be swept away.",Excalibur
259,aheyde,Great,10,11 May 2000,"This movie is animated fantasy. It shows the mythical aspects of the arthurian legend, a world of wonder, wizards, violence - and Wagner. His music (especially from ""Tristan und Isolde"" and ""Parsifal"") appoints to the film its tragic and melancholy atmosphere. The characters are a little flat, ok, but its not a plot written by Dostojewski or Proust. Its a heroic fairy tale, remembered and told for centuries, and this film gives it a depth till the beginning of our world. SEE IT!!!",Excalibur

Oh, I know it's not intended entirely seriously and I do love a movie with its tongue firmly planted in cheek, generally speaking. On the whole, sad to say, it's just bad. The dialog is atrocious yet not *quite* bad enough to be funny on that account (unlike, say, Plan 9 From Outer Space). They should either have gone whole-hog for the absurd ""python-esque"" parody or else gone for something truly dramatic. The cheesy Wagner and overdone, saccharine sentimentality comes across like warm Velveeta poured over lukewarm Doritos passed off as nachos.

262,totot57,"A strange mix of bad acting, murky fantasy, disconnected narrative, and cutesy whims",3,21 March 2005,"Sorry to say it right from the start: this movie is not just a disappointment, it simply turned me off, and I gave it the benefit of the doubt by watching it 3 times over the span of 10 years. Reaction: the same, every time. As much as I like ""knights-in-shining-armor"" movies and fantasy films, there has to be a certain narrative logic to the stories and a certain reality to the characters. Not to mention likability.The knights run around in their heavy duty armor (60-80 pounds plus in reality) as if they wear them as business suits to the office (and don't even take them off in the bedroom). The plate metal armor is so extravagant that even the richest of rich in the late middle ages couldn't have afforded more than one ""outfit"". And that was the only time, knights' armor became so elaborate. King Arthur mythology places him in the early 6th century, weapons technology was that of the dark ages, not that of the early Renaissance. Why not add some early handguns or canon to the movie, just for effect, because any sense of historicity obviously did not matter in this movie. (Did it even occur to the director?) The dance one female performed in the knight's hall early in the movie could have been inspired by Martha Graham and the modern dance movement. Fight scenes in creeks, moats and ponds, can you imagine? Wearing all that armor, which incidentally rusts easily, and wading into pools of water to fight for your life? Fake celtic music that drifts off into modern harmonies at a whim, Wagner opera pieces when the director tries to instill serenity into the scenes and audiences, because the acting sure doesn't accomplish that. Helen Mirren, an accomplished actress, is made to float around Merlin like an evil witch wind up toy, rather than a real person. Merlin himself makes his contribution to the story as seer, wise man, conspirator and occasional wise crack commentator, even court jester. (I take Gandalf the ""White Wizard"" and his twinkling eyes any day over this joke of a wizard's character. There, I did it: I mentioned LotR, and I really wanted to avoid that).Lancelot appears out of nowhere, and when he is indisposed, Percival appears out of the director's magic hat. Where did they come from, what led them to King Arthur?In conclusion, this movie does not do justice to the story, the mythology of King Arthur and his roundtable, movie storytelling in general, and the many great actors that happened to appear in this sad version of a great story of western culture (Patrick Stewart, Helen Mirren, Liam Neeson, and many more).",Excalibur

And let me tell you if you have a good DVD player with surround sound.  This movie becomes that much fascinating to watch. That is why I have added this one to my DVD collection.

264,magicgrabz,A Cinematic Masterpiece Paving the Way,10,2 June 2017,"This film is one of the best examples of visual mythic storytelling I've ever had the pleasure of watching, and the film has been with me since I was in school. It was required viewing in English Literature for me and, other than maybe Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings saga, represents the best sword and sorcery epic on the big screen. The colors, the armor, the characters, the setting, the over-the-top dialogue and the music, OH the MUSIC, all combine to form an absolute cinematic and artistic treat that perhaps will never quite find a peer.This film, of course, was made after attempts to make The Lord of the Rings failed, and therefore seems to pave the way, quite elegantly for future epic films, decades ahead of it's time. It helped launch several actors into ""household name"" status. If you want a real treat, watch the film without seeing the cast list and be surprised every time a superstar appears! Treat yourself. Watch this film. Let it grow on you. Let it become part of who you are.You'll be a better person for it, and, I promise, you'll be humming ""O Fortuna"" for the rest of your life, every time you wish to feel like the Once and Future King, clad in shining armor, ready to save the day!",Excalibur

In its attempt to weave together the various Arthurian legends into a semi-coherent whole, it manages to create an enjoyable departure into fantasy and myth. It is also to see some of the actors (Patrick Stewart, Helen Mirren, Liam Neeson, Nicol Williamson, Cherie Lunghi, Gabriel Byrne) who later went on to fame in other forms as their early selves. It also set the stage for a host of genre movies to follow. And, provided enjoyment to all the fantasy buffs at the time who had little in the world of movies to turn to.

266,kuheylanus,a film on the legend,7,7 April 2005,"John Boorman's Excalibur is one of the numerous reflections of King Arthur and Holy Grail Story on silver screen. (No less than 262 works exist on the topic) Film tries to represent King Arthur of legend primarily drawing on Malory's Le Morte D'Arthur. It is obvious that making a historical film on this topic is very difficult as not much is known on the ""true"" personality of King Arthur. So Excalibur like many other films made on the subject serves to the legend not to the history. Majority of the central personalities in Malory's Le Morte D'Arthur were given voice in the film.Although their historical representation is questionable, I found Excalibur's display of historical topics like the relationship between the chivalry and courtly love, transition from paganism to Christianity and Grail story interesting. Sir Lancelot is captured between his loyalty to his king and his love for Arthur's queen Guinevere. His chivalry is superior  he defeats all the knights including Arthur himself before joining royal army  but once Arthur defeats him  he becomes his loyal best friend. However at the same time he falls in love with Guinevere. His long struggle with this temptation is extensively depicted in the movie. Aberth claims that it was Arthurian romances  that were largely responsible for linking together the martial ideal of chivalry with the ideal of courtly love. It is also interesting that Boorman does not find it problematic representing paganism alongside with Christianity without any conflict between the two. Although it seem like the period of transition from paganism to Christianity  the conflict between two is no evident anywhere. Magic and sorcery is everywhere, Merlin is almost more central figure than Arthur himself, but still we also see Arthur's wedding taking place in a church and other symbols of Christianity around. Lack of conflict between paganism and Christianity is a distinguishing feature of the film. Representation of the Grail Story in the film is unusual. It comes out that secret of the Grail is that Arthur and the land are one and there is no religious symbol attached to the Grail. Arthur rejuvenates after drinking from the cup so in a sense he is savior of himself. No reference is made to Christianity at all.To conclude, although film is not a historical film and based on a legend, it includes important topics from medieval history like the relationship between chivalry and courtly love, transition from paganism to Christianity and the story of Holy Grail, although their historical representation is problematic. Christianity and paganism displayed side by side without any conflict and Holy Grail story is completely de-Christianized in the film.",Excalibur

All they were missing was Daniel Day Lewis... but, you've got Gabriel Byrne (in his first filmed roll), Jean-Luc Picard... I mean Patrick Stewart, Liam Niesen.Beautiful costumes, women in Arthurian times were pretty hot, and the costumes are down right sexy in this one. Some find it cheesy... have you seen Polanski's ""MacBeth""? Or some of the other movie contemporaries... like ""Clash of the Titans""? There's a cheesy turkey! With Olivier, none the less! Or, ""Sword and the Sorcerer""? Those are films that fall victim to their time. They are VERY dated.At least this film stays relatively true to the Arthurian Ledgends and is competently acted. It's still a helluva lot of fun to watch.And, Helen Mirren was pretty hot then! This flick is a good one, it's plenty gory, gratuitous nudity and a great sound track.

269,deckard-17,"""Out of the darkness rose a legend......""",10,26 October 1998,"The Dark Ages began around 500A.D. and lasted nearly 1,000 years - a vast period devoid of human intellectual progress and characterised by social chaos. Somewhere in the midst of this endures the legend of an English Saxon king who rose to unite his countrymen, drive out invaders, provide an enviornment in which learning flourished and administer justice with fairness. The basis for the legend is undoubtedly true and almost certainly refers to the pre-Norman kingdom of Wessex. Embellishments have subsequently been added to the tale, most notably by Alfred Tennyson's ""Le Morte D'Arthur"", on which this screenplay is based. With music mainly from Wagner as a backdrop, John Boorman delivers a visually stunning tour de force, complemented by excellent casting, particularly in the case of Nicol Williamson, who portrays Merlin memorably.This is a story of hope in the face of despair, of aspirations defeated by lust, of order in the face of chaos, of the importance of truth as a human quality and ultimately of redemption. I rate this as one of my top three all time favourites.",Excalibur

From the very first scene to the last fading image, I was (and still) entranced by the story line, cinematography, effects, and haunting music.This movie weaves it magic and then draws you into the story itself. Witness the birth of a legend (Excalibur), the deception of King Uther, the drawing of the sword, the battles fought, the love affair between Queen Guenevere and Sir Lancelot, the search for the Holy Grail, King Arthur's final battle and his death.Of all the movies both before and after, this one does the most justice to the legend.

Many years (and many movies) later, I have still not seen anything to displace it from the peak of its genre, and indeed have seen very few movies of any genre which are so repeatedly watch-able. Despite its falseness, the shot of Mordred spearing Arthur against a bloody sunset is still one of my lasting impressions of film history. I would agree with John Boorman himself that the direction and acting have some small shortcomings, but that the enchanting qualities of the myth override any physical elements of the movie itself. This is a case where the story is truly greater than its tellers, just the way it should be.",Excalibur
274,mypcforums,Some of the acting is terrible but . . .,6,1 September 2009,". . . the movie is the essence of the Arthurian legend.When I began to watch this movie, I was looking forward to settling down to watch good movie but, in the beginning, I was disappointed with the acting. Much of it, particularly in the first half of the movie, is some of the worst I have ever seen. The only believable actor is Patrick Stewart, who acted his part and didn't ""play-act"" in any of his scenes. Unfortunately, he was in very few scenes. I'm very surprised that he involved himself with this production, unless he did it just to have some fun. To give you an idea of the quality of the acting, there were times that Sir Lancelot reminded me of Dudley Do-Right of the Mounties.What redeems the movie, though, are good scenes, good action, some good settings and a good storyline. I enjoyed seeing the men in armor as they would have been, moving awkwardly because of the heaviness and restrictions that armor would cause, not lithely, as shown in most movies. They slip on the grass as they walk at times because of the smoothness of the metal against grass. The natural camaraderie that exists between men during the jousts and the jousts, which are not upstaged, are enjoyable to watch. The people didn't move in exact step with one another during the dance sequence. Sometimes it becomes very tiresome to see no one make a misstep during a dance in movies. The wedding of King Arthur to Guinevere was beautifully done and I enjoyed seeing, from above, the knights in their truly shining armor sitting down at the round table. But the best thing is that the movie holds true to the Aruthurian legend in all its dreamlike quality, which only a child can truly believe. This movie serves this up to adults wonderfully.",Excalibur

It is truly one of my all time favorites because it does such a compelling job of transferring the Arthurian legend to prose, film, and music.And look at some of the cast. Nigel Terry, (a young ) Helen Mirren, a superb Merlin, Nicol Williamson, as well as Patrick Stewart and Liam Neeson. Wow! One can not watch this film without feeling some emotion.

There is action, love and magic in this film. Obviously its about King Arthur and his sword that makes him king. The acting is very believable and especially from King Arthur and Merlin. The story begins with Arthur's father Uther who wants a woman he cannot have. Using the powers of Merlin he gets what he wants, which gives a scene of what I think is one of the most erotic on film. (I stress the word erotic, if you want to watch all out get a hardcore video.) After this action by Uther he creates Arthur who finds the sword and becomes King. The film follows with again for love for a woman. Lots of action in battles and lots of magic from Witches. If you haven't seen Excalibur, you need to get hold of this cos this is a classic.

Although in present times the special effects of the early 80s look corny, they still add to the movie's atmosphere.  The score is in my opinion that greatest asset of this film, using such pieces as Wagner's ""Funeral March"" and Orff's ""O Fortuna"" from his 1930s ""Carmina Burana"".The one gripe I have with this version of the legend is that Boorman used the character of Merlyn as comic relief in certain parts.

Yes, the cheesy special effects are taken into account with 1980's movies. First off, the age of the characters is all wrong. This always annoys me when they make movies off of stories. This is NOT a boy king. A man in their 30's is hardly considered to be a boy. Overall the storyline would of been pretty good had the acting not been such a train wreck. No emotion whatsoever. The fight scenes are just a bunch of men stumbling around flailing their arms around or hitting air with their weapons. No contact or any choreography whatsoever. I mean really, I get it is a movie from 1981 but man, could they have worked harder to find such horrible actors? Even the armor is way over the top. Many of the men look like they have lose breasts or other strange protrusions that just flop around with no purpose. What the heck was up with that? Now, let's get to what they got wrong with the storyline. Now, if you know any part of the story of Excalibur, there is a very vital part that is missing and that is its sheath. It doesn't exist in this movie. How people have fallen in love with such a horrible adaptation with acting that one would expect to see in a spur of the moment pornography. Whatever you do, don't waste your time with such a horrible movie. I could go on about all the horrible things are with this movie but I have already wasted too much of my life watching this train wreck hitting a garbage truck loaded with nuclear waste in New York City where 5 Million people are killed of a movie.",Excalibur

288,rorriel27,Stunning Imagery,10,20 September 2008,"I can think of only a tiny handful of films I would award 9 or 10 to, and this is right at the top of the list. I know it may sound unusual to be putting this up there with the likes of Godfather Part II and Apocalypse Now, but that is how highly I rate this film. First I thought I would comment on the two main concerns that are raised with this film by those that are not fans. The first is that the acting is very Shakespearian with constant raised voices. This for me adds to the film and simply helps to portray a different time. The other main complaint is the use of plate armour in a film that is apparently set in the Dark Ages before this was invented. This misses the point, as the armour is more for the imagery of the film, and in many ways the setting is of no particular period, except for one to fire your imagination. In terms of the positives, they are endless. It is one of those few films that you can genuinely watch several times and keep getting something new out of each watch. The cast is incredible, something that nowadays would cost an astronomical amount to assemble, but was luckily done before some of the people were household names. The cinematography is breathtaking, particularly near the end with the search for the Grail. It's also superb at the climax as the Knights ride through orchard filled landscapes to their final battle and near certain death. It is alongside this cinematography that the overall imagery takes shape that really (providing your happy to allow yourself) takes you to a magical yet at times very dark place that is full of metaphors about good, evil, greed etc. To try to give an example that hasn't already been noted is hard, but just as a small point, the wonderfully scary armour that Mordred wears is a great example of how the film conveys the imagery. As a very small point, I always wonder to myself if they were nearly out of money at the end. The last battle is very foggy which although is apparently to hide the Knight's small numbers, may have actually been to reduce the difficulty of completing such a large final battle. Either way they just pull it off. Seeing Lancelot come back for the final battle in agony with his old wound almost brings tears to your eyes. A masterpiece.",Excalibur
289,ru124c,"one of the greatest fantasy movies ever, a landmark!",10,2 November 2003,"Every movie has its flaws, and Excalibur is no exception.  However, it is by far the greatest cinematic retelling of the Arthurian Legend, and one of the greatest fantasy films ever!  The cinematography is brilliant, the music (some original, some by classical composers) fits wonderfully!  The acting is sometimes great (go Merlin!) and sometimes a bit mediocre, although never bad.  The special effects in my opinion look MUCH more realistic than any of the ugly computer trash done on most movies nowadays!  However, the strong point of this film is the storytelling -note: this SHOULD be true for all films!  A superb retelling of the main points of Sir Thomas Malory's ""Le Morte d'Arthur"" -of course being a movie, not everything could be included, but after seeing the movie you'll be happy with how it was managed!  If you have no imagination nor a romantic bone in your body, maybe you won't enjoy this film, but anyone who has always wished to see knights in battle, wield magic, or be a hero, should love this film!bottom line: one of the best fantasy films EVER (makes the current Lord of the Rings movies look like a highschool project devoid of emotion and direction)!",Excalibur
290,Columbo90,An Instant Classic,9,19 June 2007,"Boy, am I glad I saw this movie.OK, there hasn't been a movie yet, that I've seen, that follows King Arthur's story as well as Excalibur does. It shows us his father, his birth, his life, his everything.The story begins with his father Uther, played by Gabriel Byrne. He is a ruthless, violent warrior that infiltrates his enemy castle, with Merlin's help, and rapes Igrayne, who is the queen of the castle, and mother of Morgana. She becomes pregnant and gives birth to a boy, which Merlin takes and puts in the care of Sir Hector.To make a long story short, he becomes King Arthur and we follow his life as it is written by Thomas Malory.The cinematography is one of the best I've ever seen and the lighting is surprisingly good and even up to par with today's standards, such as in the scene where Arthur meets Lancelot for the first time, or in the final scene, which is one of the best in the movie.If I didn't know better I would say that this movie was made in the 90's not the 80's. The only downside to the movie is the rather weak acting it has. But it makes up for it in other parts of the movie.The make-up is also very good.

This movie has the care, the special attention to and taste for detail that elevates some works of art beyond the ordinary. The casting and acting for virtually every character is inspired. I especially love Nicol Williamson as Merlin; a great marriage of actor and character. Boorman's love for nature is quite evident as he uses the seasons and their flora as part of the story telling. The anachronistic use of plate armour can be excused since the overall styling and costumes for this movie are timeless and focus on the mythical in Arthurian legend.

294,pool_unit,The one god drives out the many,10,23 September 2014,"'Where hides evil in my kingdom?' Arthur asks Merlin after the wars are over and happiness abounds. 'Everyone of my subjects enjoys his portion of happiness and justice.' Merlin replies: 'Always, where you never expect it Always.' And as the knights rejoice at the banquet strewn table. Morgana is whispering to Gawain, instilling seeds of doubt in him and gossiping about Lancelot and Guinevere. Even as happiness is achieved other forces are at work and the world is sliding away into anarchy. The turbulence of the human heart is a kind of evil that will not allow for stability, or for kingdoms and empires to last. So when Arthur asks if we have defeated evil, Merlin knows this to be an impossibility.One aspect of the Arthurian mythology is that it takes place during the time when paganism and Christianity coexisted and influenced each other. Boorman really gets into this in and brings alive the mystery of it. Arthur is a Briton, the Romans have gone, pagan Saxons are invading from the sea. The Romano-British elite were Christian via Roman influence, but much of the land and peoples remained Celtic. None of this is mentioned, but it can all be seen. The knights have a priest, a church, but they also have Merlin, a Druidic character and self identifying necromancer, who laments that the spirits of wood and stream grow silent. There are changes going on here. He laments the coming of men, and their ways. But he must also lament Christianity putting his gods to sleep. This, then, is the tertiary background upon which everything takes place.'Do you know what's out there?' Merlin asks of Arthur, terrified of the night and the unknown. Merlin tells him: 'The Dragon. A creature of such power that to see it whole would burn you to cinders.' This dragon seems to be present in everything. A kind of pantheistic presence whose scales glisten in the bark of trees, whose roar is in the wind, and whose forked tongue strikes like lightening. This same dragon's breath held up Uther's horse over the sea so that he could sleep with Igrayne. This is not Christianity, but more like Hermeticism and Alchemy. The Corpus Hermeticum speaks or Poimandres, a being that fits this description - the Shepard of men. And this pantheism seems to reflect the Alchemical Great Work, the idea that all things are of one substance interchangeable and divine; that base can become gold. In the dragons lair beneath Camelot we seem to be walking through the heart of Arthur, within the coils of human passion itself.' You are the land and the land is you' is the spiritual revelation that brings bloom back to the desolated kingdom as Arthur drinks from the grail. The grail myth is Christianity at it's most mystical, but this too is seen through a prism of paganism. We are getting into J G Frazer and Jesse L Weston territory here, with their books 'The Golden Bough' and 'From Ritual to Romance'. The king's life is bound up with the health of the land. A sacrifice is made to rejuvenate the land, the king dies, but a new one takes the place of the old. The king is dead; long live the king! For me the film brings these elements into the Arthurian story brilliantly. It attempts to capture all the passion and darkness of this most opaque period in history. A time from which legends have emerged and persisted within our collective imaginations. No other Arthurian film has delved into the soul of the material in this way. A brilliant piece of cinema. Not to mention all the other great aspects, the cast, set design, music for example.'You brought me back. Your love brought me back. Back to where you are now. In the land of dreams'",Excalibur

Williamson is truly weird, his accent is bizarre; Nigel Terry is this side of awful but collectively the whole thing works. Boorman was inspired to use Wagner, a true Romantic in the much abused form of the word. Each of the central characters seem to understand that they are merely mechanicals (in the Shakesperean sense), part of the legend.Sadly we can all compare Boorman's film (filmed in Ireland) with the Bruckheimer travesty with Clive Owen et al. As a proud adherent of the cross of St George, Boorman did the legend proud. Completely romantic, with Celtic mystery imbued throughout this is antithetical to the modern world, and the better for it.The is the real Engliand, a mix the of the Celtic world with the Angle/Saxon/Norman invaders.Excalibur recognises this.

298,formiddominatus,"Holy god, what a weirdly awful movie",3,20 September 2007,"What an impotent film. Oh man. I strive to find an outlet for the impending rant that bubbles inside me, and I strive to find words to express how strange and terrible and weird and awesome and awful 'Excalibur' is...but nothing comes forth save an incomprehensible rant. I'll start with some formal analysis....The film should have been two hours longer. The temporal pacing is so terrible and confusing that it eventually becomes funny, much like everything else in the film. The Grail quest for instance, could be its own film, but instead gets caught in a terrible twist in the timing of the film, and Boorman uses shots that are almost incomprehensible when compared with others in the rest of the film. Ten years pass in five minutes - and suddenly Lancelot, who I just saw two minutes ago as a dashing young lad - is bearded and reminds me of that one hobo who talked to himself in the Cousins on Oakland Avenue. You can't put your mind around that kind of senseless and terribly thought-out leap.The acting....the acting! How awful. Patrick Stewart and Liam Neeson and Helen Mirren turn in the low points of their professional careers - although Stewart and Neeson have about four lines put together, and you can just *tell* Stewart regards it as a joke - he just has that tone of voice that illustrates he's doing it for fun to have a story for the grandkids - ""Did I ever tell you about that *awful* Camelot movie I was in? Jesus, you kids should see it. Wait, nevermind, no you shouldn't."" And Nicol Williamson's Merlin puts that same kind of inflection into every line - it sounds like he's doing the voice-over for a kid's TV show instead of a serious cinematic effort. And what was with that helmet? Was he a medieval amateur boxer? And when he falls into the river - good god almighty. That much camp should never be taken seriously, and obviously wasn't intended to be.And speaking of acting - someone please explain to me how the absolute WORST actor in the entire film ends up with the lead role? Nigel Terry, whose film acting is so bad he doesn't even have a photo on IMDb, can't deliver one single line right in the entire film - he blabbers through them all, and when he's required to put some bravado into a line he screams it at the top of his lungs like Arthur was on fire.All the scenes are so unintentionally funny - through terrible acting, ridiculous staging, Merlin (Merlin!), and verbal bastardization of what is actually a quality script. The film is devoid of emotion for all but three minutes, sapped of the stuff by the incompetent acting best demonstrated by newborns and hamsters. When Mordred beat Morgana to death - that was *funny*. I know the beating to death of a haggard old woman really shouldn't be, but...Christ, it never occurred to me in that scene that it was anything but a joke; it was carried out and acted so god awfully.As for Mordred, he was the only character who actually convinced me of his role, let alone of his portrayal. The golden armor was actually quite creepy and weird and scary, and the ""Come father, let us embrace at last"" line is delivered with such evil and venom that for a second I forgot about the other 99% of the movie - almost. Jesus, did I mention that toothless old lady got smacked around? Oh right, I did. And she vomited SMOKE. Good god, I'm rambling.And then there's the serious misuse of classical music, which could encompass an entire rant on its own - you never, NEVER fade out of a classical piece. Why? Because it was impossible to write them that way. And they fade out of 'O Fortuna' three or four times - god it makes me angry.But on the whole, no matter how awful and terrible and strange (at the risk of repeating myself) 'Excalibur' is, it is an absolute Camp masterpiece - every scene is unintentionally hilarious in some way, the lighting is consistently and rampantly awful, the sound is abbreviated and often poor, the acting (o god the acting), the staging, the pacing - it's all FUNNY. It's a movie that you watch and laugh and are embarrassed like you were seeing an episode of 'I Love Lucy,' but at least on 'ILL' the humor was intentional - here it's just...odd. And the scene where he finds the Holy Grail...well, you'll just have to witness it yourself. But not after you see the Grail scenes from 'Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade' - just to put things in perspective. He was wearing a loin cloth. How the hell did that happen?

The (sometimes humorous) interpretation of MERLIN as a nature-near druid, rather than an old man with a loooong white beard (...""a dream to some, but a nightmare to others!!"") was setting standards for later visions of the wise old man that ages backwards (as in ""PRINCE VALLIAND"" for instance)... Mordred- both as the child and as the young, grown knight- haunted my nightmares when I was younger. The vision of a golden knight, wearing an armor shaped like the body of an innocent boy, that personifies pure evil and sin stayed in my mind and changed my vision of ""bad"" forever. Lancelot- oh Lancelot... ""never have I seen a knight as magnificent as this one""... If you ever were into medieval movies then you cannot avoid this one.",Excalibur
302,Ruadhan-2,A visual treat with action and wit to boot,10,21 June 1999,"This film is a real joy to behold. A visual treat from start to finish, this is one of the most atmospheric films I have ever seen. A typically intelligent work from John Boorman, Excalibur full of action, romance very funny in places, especially  Merlin as he mumbles his way through the forest. Although the film is based on the sublime story in Le Morde d'Arthur, the work cleverly blows away any Hollywood preconceptions about what the characters should look like. Look out for the wedding scene- a cinema masterpiece combined with a very clever off-action scene. Also look for a recurring theme throughout the film about how the old pagan ways are falling to modern religion. As in Le Morde d'Arthur, the concepts of friendship companionship are tested dramatically. The film very original, very clever and very very good.",Excalibur

At age 37 I am still fascinated by this movie. I have seen this movie approxamately 50 times and each  time I see it I continue to be drawn in by the finest telling of the Arthurian legend that has ever been done on film today.

304,morgana869,A wonderful representation of the most popular version of the legend.,10,25 January 2000,"This film is a wonderful portrayal of the most popular version of the King Arthur legend. The characters are reliable and definitely believable. I personally liked the way they portrayed the romance between Arthur and Guenivere. It showed the love and respect between them while still showing cause for her betrayal. They didn't portray her as a harlot just a woman who made a mistake and later tried to repent for it. I highly recommend this movie to anyone, but most definitely to any Arthurian Gurus out there.",Excalibur
305,burnt_ash,A unique film with a strong cast.,9,8 April 2000,"In my opinion this film is unique.  It follows Thomas Mallory's ""Le Morte D'Arthur"" fairly accurately.  This is something rarely achieved by other films focused on the genre. The casting is excellent, Nigel Terry portrays both the naive boyish Arthur and the elder statesman with great panaché. Helen Mirren makes for a convincingly evil Morgan Le Faye whilst the gorgeous Cheri Lunghi shines as Arthur's bride.  Lancelot is convincing as he struggles with divided loyalties but the main credit for the film's success must surely go to Nicol Williamson as Merlin. The film attempts to portray a dark period of English history and this is convincingly portrayed in the atmosphere, costume and make up of the actors but by adopting a light hearted portrayal of a serious character, he manages to balance just the right amount of comic relief. Towards the film's conclusion the charge of the knights through the orchard to the sound of a choir singing the ""Carmina Birana"" has to be one of the high points of British cinema.",Excalibur
306,SimonTheDog,Well worth seeing,9,11 June 2000,"Excalibur is a very clever film, in that it managed to remain true to Thomas Malory's excellent fifteenth century account of the Arthurian legends. His book ""Le Morte d'Arthur"" is a VERY lengthy collection of stories, not so much in terms of its volume, but in the amount of action that takes place. While Malory focused more on the knights of the Round Table and those associated with it, Excalibur focused on Arthur. John Boorman elegantly captured the essence of Arthur's story, Lancelot's betrayal, and the fall of Camelot. Constraints (likely in the budget) lead to some obvious technical weakness in the film, though that did not detract from the quality of the story. It is easily the best film adaptation of the original legends, and is not a ""modern retelling,"" though it manages wonderful revisionist technique.All-in-all it is a great film, though admittedly would be enjoyed most by those with an interest in the legends. My vote (of 9/10) is enthusiastic, but qualified.",Excalibur

The scenery and customs (mainly the armor) are belong to the Gothic era (late Middle Ages) and not to the era that Arthur ruled (which is about 600AD). But it isn't bad, on the counterary - it is good! The movie is much more impressive with full metal plates suit of armors and great swords.

The sets are simply brilliant and have great a dream-like quality, which is reminiscent of one of John William Waterhouse's paintings. This coupled with Wagner's music has produced for me the most out-standing film for the past 20 years. There's only one slight criticism, the West country accents, these couldn't be more out of place in 5-6th century Romano-Britain, but I must emphasise, on the whole they're insignificant to the impact of the film.

That's what is captivating about this movie. The events are approached with total emotional reality. The film creates a world in which these events really happen, there's no jarring pull back to reality while watching it. The special effects hold up fairly well because there isn't an over-reliance on them to begin with. Knowing that CGI techniques are so prevalent tends to make me hyper aware of them in movies that use them, creating friction that makes it harder to suspend my disbelief. I don't want to sit there spotting the special effects, I want to live in the film for the time I am watching it. Excalibur achieves this in spades. Excellent casting. Excellent acting, really appropriate and gorgeous costume design. One of my all time very best movies ever, especially viewed through the lens of Jungian psychology.",Excalibur

Some movies have good production, some good casting, others good dialogue. This movie has ALL of it. The script of this movie is so poetic and vivid that it's impossible to miss the artwork of this film. On top of that, there are a lot of then not so big names such as Liam Neeson, Gabriel Byrne, Patrick Steward, and Helen Mirren just to name a few.This is an actor's movie. For certain it is obvious all participants thoroughly enjoyed this production and put their hearts into it. The chemistry is so perfect that Nicole Williamson (Merlin) and Helen Mirren (Morgana) in real life have a strong distaste for one another since their days of acting aside in live plays. It's appropriate since in the storyline, Merlin and Morgana are diametrically opposed enemies.The music score is just as intense and Wagner pretty much owns as it is outside of this film. If there HAS to be a negative on this film it would be the length and the pace it moves. Personally I have no problem with it but a lot of impatient people would find the movie ""slow"" or ""too long"" However I am only stating this as an absolute forced negative aspect. Do not let this deter you from at least renting the feature. WELL worth the time.This movie IS the standard for this time period storyline. Many others have been released since and they, to me are frustrating to even see advertised because of how disappointing they seem next to this film.

The late Nigel Terry is great as King Arthur, I also loved him in Caravaggio, a shame that he was so little known as an actor. Nicol Williamson's Merlin is also unforgettable, in fact the entire cast is excellent. The music (Wagner) fits right in and enhances the power of the images.

There is no respect for the historical costumes, weapons and armors at all. The story is set in the 6th century, but it looks like the 14th or 15th century ! It would be less anachronistic to make contemporary people wear the same garments as in the movie !

I first watched this movie because I was curious, I thought it was totally over acted and cheesy as a movie gets; then I watched it again and said ""Where have you been all my life"". I just fell in love with this movie & wondered why it isn't very popular. So good, so skillfully made, so underrated. I have it on stop to write this for crying out loud. Watch it, hate it, watch it again and love it. I know it sounds stupid to get a movie and have to watch its 2 hours and 20 minutes twice to see if if you like it.

320,t-gato,"My third all time favorite movie, and so far the best presentation of Arthur's legend",10,19 June 2008,"I first saw this movie when I was 5. My family lived in Germany at that time, and my dad would take me to all these castles and armories and I would see all this beautiful full plated German-crafted armor. That's how my on and off interest with knights began. When I first heard of King Arthur, I knew it was the story for me. Furthermore, when I saw this film, I wore out our tapes a few times that we had to buy more.This movie has everything you could want in a good movie. Action, love, friendship & betrayal, magic, great wardrobes and good lessons in morality. The armor by Terry English is fantastic. He has always been a great armorer and has done other great knight films from The Messenger to the awful King Arthur (2004). It was great to see the contrast between the black monstrous helmeted armors, to the graceful silver armor worn during Arthur's reign. The characters are all developed well, but it's a shame that most of the main character actors (Nigel Terry, Nicholas Clay, etc) didn't achieve the fame they deserved. Personally, my favorite character and knight in this film is Kay, Arthur's brother. He remains loyal to Arthur throughout the whole film and protects him as his older brother until his death in the final battle. Speaking of that, the final battle is fantastic, as are all the battle scenes. Good fight choreography.So all in all, a 10 star film, and so far the best of the Arthur films. This is my 3rd all time favorite movie after only T2 and The Terminator. If you like knight cartoons and movies, I suggest stuff like the Record of Lodoss War saga (an anime from Japan) and The Messenger (starring Milla Jovovich).",Excalibur
321,michael-abatemarco,A Dream to Some,10,16 March 2013,"1981 was a great year to be an 11 year old thanks to such films as Raiders of the Lost Ark, Clash of the Titans, and, of course, Excalibur. I love the technical aspects of it as a film and then there is the timeless story. Few film versions of the Arthur legend capture the ""Once Upon a Time"" feeling of Excalibur, but director John Boorman bathes his mythic vision in blood and grime. Excalibur plays like great tragedy. As others have mentioned, even minor characters make an impression like the reluctant Uryens who has two or three brief but memorable scenes. All the leads do fine jobs carrying the film. Nigel Terry's transformation from the young, naive Arthur to the just and commanding king of legend is remarkable. It's hard to believe it's the same actor in this under-appreciated performance. Cherie Lunghi's portrayal of Guenevere is flawless and Helen Mirren appropriately vamps it up as the sorceress Morgana, bent on exacting unholy revenge. Her on screen chemistry with Nicol Williamson comes with a memorable repartee. Paul Geoffrey's Perceval is also an underrated performance that follows a similar trajectory to that of Terry's in that he plays the character across a broad spectrum of years beginning first as a lad. For a time, he carries the film. Nicholas Clay as Lancelot deserves more recognition, too. It saddens me that Clay died so young; the world was robbed of a great and talented actor. Here, he delivers dialogue with confidence and also undergoes a transformation that's very much in keeping with some of the source material. His ventures into the forests, where spends much of his time, provide opportunities to see some gorgeous, emerald landscapes — dark, mossy Irish forests — rendered dreamlike by Alex Thomson's cinematography. If Clay and Lunghi as Lancelot and Guenevere represent Excalibur's heart, Williamson's Merlin is its soul. He embodies a world of dreams and magic, of pagan nature religion in the autumn of its days as Christianity spreads throughout the land. The heady mix of pagan and Christian imagery and symbolism is a leitmotif as embodied in the juxtaposition of Merlin and Arthur. There's nary a dragon to be found except for the metaphorical variety. Here the real monsters are only men and women and our greatest adversaries are ourselves.",Excalibur

The film is mostly Drama with the odd bit of violence and sex thrown in. Although at times it is hard to relate to the character's emotions in this version, the acting is (Mostly) excellent. Nigel Terry handles the role of Arthur well as he matures from boy to older man. Helen Mirren is excellent too, along with Liam Neeson and Patrick Stewart popping up for the first time. Nicol Williamson brings in a unique performance as Merlin which is sheer genius in its portrayal. He is the true star of this film.Some acting, however is poor. Nicholas Clay and Paul Geoffrey lack a sense of characterisation. This does not subtract from the film's overall greatness though.A worthwhile buy for King Arthur and fantasy fans.

I cannot imagine any other piece of music being used in place of this largely forgotten gem.John Boorman has given this film something for everyone, action, fantasy and romance, whilst adding subtle humour.

For many years in teaching Fine Arts I used clips of the film as an exemplary story that emerged from transition of the Dark Ages into the Medieval. Gnostic mysticism and strongly metaphorical references due to anticipation of completion of the first millennium set into motion much European culture, arts and music that led to the Renaissance and mass production of books, through which the story was preserved. Everything therein is powerfully metaphorical and clearly food for thought. Use of Carmina Burana and Gotterdamerung, and the all-star cast well thought and compelling.I showed clips of Excalibur when my concert band and choir learned Carmina Burana for the spring concert. I wanted my students to understand the Arthur legend, the cyclic ""wheel of fortune"" period when Carmina was written, and film is a powerful educational tool. Administration deemed the film inappropriate, called it educationally worthless, even though they never watched it, and I was dismissed a week before the Spring concert for poor judgment by showing it. The students were denied their concert.Excalibur is hardly educationally worthless. Boorman produced a masterpiece that I highly recommend people watch, or watch again.

It does not stray too far from the usual canon, which pleases the purists and makes it easier for the novice to follow.

The truth of the grail in the story is that the king and the land are one, something Merlin tells Arthur at the beginning, but Arthur unfortunately forgets during the years of his kingship. This truth is lost to him when he becomes separated from Guinevere, his queen and his subsequent illness infects the land. It takes the fool, Perceval, to find the grail, for only the fool who has no pretensions of knowledge or ego, is innocent enough to see the truth without judging it.

333,claus-245-7474,Excalibur - The Western Kurosawa experience,9,14 September 2019,"Boorman's star specked Excalibur (Liam Neeson, Patrick Stewart, Gabriel Byrne) is arguably one of the greatest Hollywood epics ever. For decades, it has consistently been on my Top 10 list for the genre for a few simple reasons:The first time I watched it on late night TV, two minor elements stuck in my mind: The rape of Igraine, depicted as a shockingly despicable act but without pandering to sadism. Gabriel Byrne is on top of a naked Katherine Boorman, wearing full knightly armor for perverse effect.The rest of the story is a product of this unholy union, facilitated against his more ideal wishes by Merlin himself: Arthur's throne and court, the subsequent betrayal by Lancelot and Guenevere, the curse on the land, the rise of Morgan Le Fay and Mordred, the final battle - all are consequences of this one daunting moment in movie history, so to speak.The second stunning moment is Lancelots transformation to the point of unrecognizable, fostering the iconic line from Sir Percival upon reunion: ""Lancelot, is that you?""Both these moments stand out for their audacity - the courage behind the decision to take Mideval high drama and translate it without filter to a modern audience. In most cases, a classical story will go through layers of remodelling, during which elements that a thought to repulse the audience are sifted out and replaced with more ""elegant"" plot options.Excalibur does not wallow in violence or gore from today's standards, nor does it routinely cut down darlings for effect, like, say, some popular TV-shows with wizards and dragons. It is, however, surprisingly coarse, which is not so much a result of trying to be contemporary for the age (1980s) as the desire to stay loyal to the original prescript.Even if the acting may appear stiff at times, production values sub-par with today's blockbusters, and the pacing swift enough to justify at least a mini-series with this title, the attentive viewer is left with the sensation of having watched something truly great.On my second viewing it struck me that this is the closest thing you get to a Western version of a Kurosawa epic like Ran or Seven Samurai - at once gritty and sparkling, mixing mud with nobility, like a diamond half rough and half masterfully cut.This rendition of the Arthurian legend draws you into a zone, where magic and curses seem natural rather than exceptional. The director has the guts to destroy his heroes, both by having them picked by birds as their corpses hang from a tree, and by exposing the depth of their human shortcomings.Third and fourth time around, it dawned on me Exalibur is a supremely mature movie, adult in the sense that it lets whatever happens to people in life happen to its protagonists - while it also offers glimpses of hope along the way and the possibility of redemption. There are more than a few scenes laden with peculiar sexual symbolism, such as Lancelot kissing the tip of Excalibur after having been defeated. Excalibur does this all the time, drawing on popular theories of psychology and sexuality of the day, Jungian as well as Reichian.Still, what you must love about it, is it's loyalty to the Mideval myth, the superstitition and the innate logic of the twists and turns in the plot.",Excalibur

Having sung many operas, I can tell you that if that element is missing, it is boring. Directors are very conscious of that element in their product. I felt it between Morgana and her son, the beautiful sequences of Guinevere and Lancelot and Merlin himself. After all that is one of Arthur's failings to her. That is what makes for such a powerful tragedy. We just ache for Arthur at the end. That's why we cry. Not just for him but for ourselves. Don't you think that is what makes us so taken with most myths, for instance Tristan and Isolde. Last night I watched ""Troy"" and noticed that Nigel Terry was a player. I honestly don't know who he played but it got me thinking about ""Excalibur"". It is one of my favorite movies of all time. One of the reviews calls Nigel Terry to task for his acting in the first part of the movie. But isn't that one of the great things that he shows us; the way Arthur changes from a youth to a man. It seems a paradox that though the characters in ""Excalibur"" are mythic, they are human too. In contrast ""Troy"" is bloodless, yes sexless. Brad Pitt is beautiful (don't care much for the hair) but boring. The best performance is by Peter O'toole when he pleads for his son's body. The music in ""Excalibur"" is almost a character too. Wagner operas use the voice as an instrument to convey the grand emotions and here he uses the music to enlarge the experience. And all that energy becomes deep emotional love, its beauty for beauty's sake. Love's power is the life force of the universe. We can all of us experience its power for good or evil. I think that is another tragedy of Arthur, once he had that love's power and lost it. Not just Guinevere but his whole domain. But you see, we have the same thing, only we don't get the same send off that he did. But we can dream.",Excalibur
336,mannystylz,Somehow Solid & Shaky Simultaneously,8,27 September 2018,"I stumbled upon this movie by chance as I was looking up things related to the mythology. If you're like me and enjoy the story's base then you will enjoy it as most things seem to have been checklisted. (round table check, lady of the lake check, holy grail check, etc)
As a movie, I feel some parts have not aged well. This is not necessarily because of special effects (although lightning effect in one scene looked especially terrible.) I put the blame more on the director who seems to have split personalities. Some scenes are beautiful beyond words while other scenes are laughably awful. Some acting is great (Nigel Terry, Helen Mirren) while others are cringe-worthy bad (Gabriel Byrne, Liam Neeson.) Some fight scenes were awesome, some not so much. It appears as if the director was super on point one day; and then the next day he didn't really care and said, ""meh... whatever... alls I know is we're shoe horning more fog in somehow!""Oh and Helen Mirren absolutely steals the show.",Excalibur
337,exclamationpointquestion,"Pretty bad, overall.",3,6 October 2005,"This movie made me hurt. Badly. The acting is poor (the actor who played Merlin, in particular, is guilty of some pretty serious overacting-related sins). The dialogue is stilted. The film does not flow coherently from one scene to the next, in many cases stopping the action and then simply starting back up at a later point in the plot with little in the way of signposting. The characterizations, as well, are pretty poor: more than once a character does something that, from a motivation standpoint, simply makes no sense (and which is made much more sense of in the literature associated with the film). The fight scenes are extraordinarily hokey. The music is frequently inappropriate to the point of being funny; on the other hand, there is at least one fight scene that contains no music at all, and suffers badly for it.This is an all-around sub-par film. If you want to watch an Arthurian fantasy, you'd be better off picking something else.",Excalibur
338,ceyhunbirinci,Legendary Performances for a Well-known Legend,10,5 February 2008,"Many movies has been made about the Arthurian Legend, many different versions of his story has been told, but i think John Boorman's version tops them all. It's based on the 15th century author Sir Thomas Malory's book Le Morte d'Arthur, perhaps the best-known version of the legend. What separates this movie from others is, definitely, it's theatrical acting which put on the scene by many soon to be famous actors alongside with the masters in the cast.Nicol Wlliamson creates an unlikely figure of Merlin which will entertain you through the movie with such a mysterious way. 'Born to be queen' Helen Mirren does what she does best once again, like Liam Neeson, a Jedi knight to a medieval knight, it's his job to represent the 'knighthood'. Along with Nigel Terry, Nicholas Clay and Patrick Stewart they form the most splendid Round Table ever.Must see movie for fantasy fans which can't resist the excitement of knights in shiny armors (especially if they're in award-winning costumes), sword & sorcery, charity, battle of good against evil, and a good soundtrack which contains 'O Fortuna' will lead you through Dark Ages..",Excalibur
339,rosemachine,Excalibur zone,9,26 January 2006,"This is my first entry on this site. I humbly ask to join your exchange regarding the movie ""Excalibur."" Movies are for going places. I believe to appreciate the maximum spectrum of movie types, one must allow himself to ride along without devoting significant attention to analysis. Turn off the spell check and let the artists' craft wash over you. Our work lives are analysis; let your movie watching be not work. Obviously if things are ridiculous, inconsistent, or annoying enough, one is distracted out of the zone. There seems to be significant majority of movie criticisms based on tech flaws like empty, then unempty coffee cups rather than criticisms about how flawed movies derail you out of the artists' intended zone. If you don't want to be in the zone intended by the movie, you shouldn't be at that movie. I think some of the most interesting criticisms are the ones that detail how they derailed you and what they should have done to keep you in the zone. I think Excalibur is a great movie if you drop the microscope and drop into the story. I think Excalibur does what I think a movie should do which is consistently put you and keep you in their intended zone.",Excalibur
340,houseonarthur,The best of this line of films,10,10 February 2006,"It stayed with the epic theme of the story. A boy who would be king, and his struggle for his kingdom. It touches on all the aspects of the Arthurian mythology. His father falling to lust, the sword in the stone, the betrayal of Lancelot. I would rather see a remake made in this style rather than the cheesy Richard Gere/ Sean Connery bomb that was horrible. Now for the bad. It did have bad special effects though they were top-notch for the period of movie making. Some of the story also begins to get lost as it gets later in the film. It is nice to see young Liam Neason and Patrick Stewart. Which seem to be the only box office worthy stars within the film.",Excalibur
341,sinicolson,Excalibur. The best of the King Arthur films.,10,16 February 2006,"Excalibur is a truly atmospheric film. It has the ability to take you back to the time it depicts, without using sentimentality or rose tinted spectacles. Having seen the film numerous times, I still get more out of it with every viewing. It certainly seemed to start many careers on the right path and many of the actors are very well known now. My only sadness is that Paul Geoffrey and Nigel Terry, two of the main character actors, seem not to have become such household names. They both stand out in the film and to my mind have made it what it is, brilliant. Great direction, production, photography and music. King Arthur himself would have been proud of it.",Excalibur
342,bongates,Sir Percvevil,10,6 November 2018,"Love this film, Sir Percival, AKA Paul Geoffrey, is my fav, just love him, he is the hero in this film.",Excalibur
343,irinap-1,Excellent,8,15 March 2006,"I don't think I have ever seen a 10/10 movie before so my giving this one an 8 is way up there. I've seen this movie many many times and I still find it entertaining and mystical every time. It has, by far, been the best rendition of the old ""sword and the stone"" legend that I have ever seen. There is plenty of action, adventure, drama, love & lust, and of course gore to satisfy just about every mood. Directors and producers did a wonderful job in my opinion as well as the actors of course and I don't think a single character from the old legend was left out of the script (unsure about this one though). It was also nice to see that the movie wasn't full of superstar actors but rather incredibly talented and dedicated actors and actresses that brought me one of my all time favourite movies. This one deserves a spot in the private collection.",Excalibur
