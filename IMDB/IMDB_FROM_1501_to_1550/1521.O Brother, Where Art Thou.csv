0,MartinHafer,The film gets better and better each time I watch it,10,19 September 2007,"Despite me giving this film a 10, it is NOT my favorite Coen Brothers film (that honor would go to the even more bizarre and quirky HUDSUCKER PROXY). However, it still is an amazingly good film. The first time I saw it, I might have scored it an 8, but now after seeing it again, I find myself laughing even harder and enjoying it even more. Plus, while the film is a hilarious retelling of Homer's ""ODYSSEY"", I find myself spotting more and more story elements from this great book. The cleverness in doing this was truly a work of genius. On top of that, the music is so infectiously fun that you can't help but tap your feet and even sing along--it's THAT good.The film begins with the escape of three idiots from a chain gang. The normally handsome George Clooney is rather greasy and stubbly looking but he always manages to look far more attractive than his incredibly ugly and occasionally dim-witted sidekicks. I liked John Turturro quite a bit, but especially fun was Tim Blake Nelson as the dumbest and ugliest of the lot! He was incredibly funny throughout--especially when he was convinced that Turturro had been turned into a frog (much like when Odysseus' men had been turned into pigs in THE ODYSSEY).However, these three guys were not the whole show, as like most of the best Coen films, they are surrounded by the best supporting performances you can find in film. Charles Durning (who was great in THE HUDSUCKER PROXY) was delightful as the wily old governor and Holly Hunter was wonderfully awful, but so many wonderful actors and actresses adorned this lovely film. So many odd faces (much like a Fellini film) and quirky personalities made this film truly memorable.The look and sound of the film was also terrific--with a real nice early 1930s look about it and great sepia-toned cinematography and the best toe-tappinest soundtrack I've heard in years. I usually hate old time country music, but the songs they chose were amazing! And the actors did a great job in pretending to be singing the songs.See this film. In fact, after you see this film, see ANYTHING the Coens made--THE HUDSICKER PROXY, RAISING ARIZONA, THE MAN WHO NEVER WAS, INTELLERABLE CRUELTY, MILLERS CROSSING and pretty much most of their other wonderful films. Oddly, while it won so much fame, one of their worst and most disappointing films was FARGO--a one joke film. Plus, I gotta admit that BARTON FINK really fell apart towards the end.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
1,bkoganbing,An Odyssey Through Mississippi,9,11 October 2020,"George Clooney, Tim Blake Nelson, and John Turturro star as 3 Mississippi escaped convicts in 30s Mississippi where they run into all kinds of adventure on the way
back to Clooney's home and hearth and aa 'treasure' purportedly buried there.
There's a gubernatorial race going on in Mississippi at the time and that's woven
into the plot.As this film is based on Homer's Odyssey and that work is a few thousand years
old I think the Coen Brothers took the point of view that this is already a few
thousand years in the future and the mythology of the times is being explored
So who will know or care that Pappy O'Daniel did this thing in Texas and Baby
Face Nelson never did his criminal deeds in Mississippi.Speaking of which Charles Durning as Pappy O'Daniel and Michael Badalucco
as Baby Face Nelson are having a ball overacting in their outsized performances. In fact this whole film has everybody overacting like crazy.
Nothing subtle here.The tone however is set by George Clooney as the leader of the three escaped
convicts. His droll style is nothing short of marvelous. Nelson and Turturro
are a pair of brain dead followers who probably did something along the lines
of what Paul Newman did to earn his place on the chain gang in Cool Hand Luke. As for Clooney when we find out what he did his gift of gab is explained.As we know Ulysses was just trying to get home to his Penelope here is Holly
Hunter with her seven daughters. She hasn't exactly let grass grow under her feet, but married to Clooney who could blame her?What Clooney did might be considered white collar crime. But Mississippi had
no minimum security prisons then. Not sure the state has one now. As he sees
it a man like himself is wasted on a road gang and his choice of companions
is dictated by who he was chained with.You will have one rollicking good time watching O Brother Where Art Thou? It's a film that could use several viewings to get all the humor out of it.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
2,Leofwine_draca,Typical Coens,6,18 September 2021,"A typical Coen Brothers movie: quirky, period fare, with some earnest performances and idiosyncratic humour. I admit that I didn't laugh very much during this one but I enjoyed it all the same and George Clooney is clearly in his element.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
3,SnoopyStyle,Coen masterpiece,8,14 September 2013,"Loosely based on Homer's ""Odyssey"", Ulysses Everett McGill (George Clooney), Delmar O'Donnell (Tim Blake Nelson), and Pete Hogwallop (John Turturro) are escaped convicts in 1930s Mississipi. They travel the roads to get to Everett's buried bank loot. A whole lot of fanciful adventures including creek side sirens, the KKK, chased by Sheriff Cooley, and an epic flood.Through it all, they sing some good songs. There is a lot of great fun old time music. Music is such an integral part of this movie, and it fits the style of the movie. This is a beautiful piece of art. A fast-talking fantasy. A sumptuous visual love letter.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
4,Hitchcoc,Master Storytellers,9,24 February 2006,"Those Coen brothers' movies really do grown on you. I had just seen Fargo when I rented this. It is one of the most creative, off the wall films I have ever seen. As these characters bumble their ways after a prison break, they are embraced by a series of the most unconventional personages ever to hit filmdom. And one gets turned into a frog--sort of. their flirtations with fame, the Klan, a cyclops, and all the other episodes, make this a hilarious romp. George Clooney's Ulysses is an obsessive, full speed ahead, damn the torpedoes, coupled with the charming half-wittedness of his fellow travelers, works at every level. Like Greek poetry, he is butting heads with the gods, but despite setbacks, keeps moving. It is story telling with charm and a load of bull. Everyone is some kind of philosopher, but the words come out of gap toothed, shaved headed hillbillies. And, of course, Clooney has hell to pay. I could watch this over and over again. And then there's the really cool music. I didn't even mention that!","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
5,classicsoncall,"""...it's a fool that looks for logic in the chambers of the human heart.""",9,3 March 2012,"I get just the biggest kick out of this picture. So much so that I regularly listen to the film's soundtrack and have been inspired to memorize the words to 'The Big Rock Candy Mountain"". That song singularly captures the whimsical nature of the picture, and prefaces the adventurous escapades of our hero trio - 'In the Big Rock Candy Mountain, all the jails are made of tin, and you can walk right out again as soon as you are in.' Not being a fan of George Clooney, I thought he did an exceptional job here as the nominal leader of the chain gang misfits that make a break for it on the road to fame and fortune. It's only later that we come to realize that Everett's quest is really to reunite with his wife and kids, and dispel the notion that he was hit by a train. Clooney's given all the best lines by virtue of his good looks and snappy delivery, and his 'dumber than a bag of hammers' line is one I'm apt to use from time to time myself.So everyone knows by now that the story is based on Homer's 'Odyssey', but I haven't heard anyone yet make a connection to one of my favorite childhood films. Remember when Everett, Pete (John Turturro) and Delmar (Tim Blake Nelson) pop up over the hedge and join the procession at the Klan rally. Wasn't it oddly reminiscent of ""The Wizard of Oz""? The only thing missing was Delmar trying to tuck a tail underneath his robe. And say, didn't Pete look a lot like the scarecrow? To sum it up - good story, cool characters, witty dialog and a great musical score make this a favorite of mine, and probably the first Coen Brothers film to get my attention enough to seek out their other pictures. This one though is the one I'll keep coming back to watch again and again, it's that entertaining.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
6,gavin6942,"One of the Best, No Question",9,20 February 2015,"In the deep south during the 1930s, three escaped convicts search for hidden treasure while a relentless lawman pursues them.Saying this is the Coen Brothers' greatest film would be hard, as so many of their movies are among the greatest made in the last few decades. Does this surpass ""Fargo"" or ""The Big Lebowski""? Some would say yes, but how do you decide that? ""Lebowski"" is one of the biggest cult films of its generation.What is great about this film is... well, everything. Solid acting, beautiful cinematography (particularly the sepia tones) and a great adaptation of the work of Homer. Classic literature does not always come across as fresh to modern generations. In this incarnation, it certainly does. A special nod must go to Tim Blake Nelson. Although not as big of a name as George Clooney or John Turturro, he is an equal part of this comedy trio.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
7,lee_eisenberg,Only the Coen brothers could create something so magical AND wacky,10,9 May 2005,"Most people would probably never imagine transposing ""The Odyssey"" to 1930's Mississippi, but the Coen brothers pulled it off perfectly. George Clooney, John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson play three jailbirds (named Ulysses, Pete and Delmar, respectively) who escape from a chain gang and subsequently travel through a world containing a blind soothsayer, Sirens, a cycloptic Bible salesman (John Goodman), and even Baby Face Nelson (Michael Badalucco). Yep. You read that right. And to crown it all, Ulysses always needs some Dapper Dan pomade for his hair. Holly Hunter plays Ulysses wife Penny (short for Penelope) who has all but given up on him.Of course, the movie's real forte is its music. A litany of mesmerizing, folksy ballads, they truly could not have come up with a better soundtrack.And as a final note, ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" gives new meaning to the idea of a ""horny toad"".","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
8,jboothmillard,"O Brother, Where Art Thou?",7,14 September 2005,"I don't exactly understand the meaning of the title, probably something to do with country folk or the time that the characters were living in, but it is a good film from the Coen brothers. This is quite an interesting story about some escape prisoners (with some accent) on the run and trying to get on with a new life. Golden Globe winning George Clooney as Ulysses Everett McGill is really good (and if it was really him), he is good at singing. On the way Clooney and his two companions Pete (John Turturro) and Delmar O'Donnell (Tim Blake Nelson) meet farm people, some police and a KKK group run by Big Dan Teague (John Goodman). Also starring Holly Hunter as Penny Although the ending is a tiny bit unlikely and confusing, the rest is still a film to watch. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Cinematography and Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material Previously Produced or Published, it was nominated the BAFTAs for the Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music, Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design, Best Production Design and Best Original Screenplay, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Comedy/Musical. George Clooney was number 72 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and he was number 7 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols. Very good!","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
9,ccthemovieman-1,"Mixed Emotions Message-Wise, But Extremely Entertaining",7,17 March 2006,"This may be the only film that is blatantly anti-Christian that I still give a high rating, simply because it was so entertaining. Hopefully, some of the religious digs were tongue-in-cheek and not meant in a mean-spirited way, but I'm not sure, especially considering who made it.I DO know this was fun to watch and hear, except for the excessive usage of the Lord's name in vain with George Clooney as the main culprit. The music in here is super, led by the catchy ""Man Of Constant Sorrow,"" performed by Gary Tyminski. I also loved ""Soggy Mountain Boys"" humorously sang and presented by the three main characters: Clooney, John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson. Those three guys were hilarious, particularly Nelson with his rubber-faced looks. Audibly, the entire soundtrack is outstanding, under the direction of T-Bone Burnett. I wound up buying the CD as millions of other people did. Fantastic music.The way this was filmed makes it visually fascinating, with scenery enhanced by computer graphics and all-time great Roger Deakins in charge of the photography. All the people in this movie are wacky, as are the people who made it: the unfortunately clever-but-biased Coen brothers. The parade of wild characters, wild scenes one after the other and the three likable leads (yeah, even the profane Clooney) make this an extremely fast-moving 103-minute movie.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
10,Tweekums,Another Coen Brothers' Classic,8,11 July 2008,"Like most Coen Brothers' films that I've seen this had a surreal quality to it. Very loosely based on ""The Odyssey"" it follows the adventures or three convicts on the run after escaping from their chain gang in rural Mississippi during the depression. Everett Ulysses McGill (George Clooney), there self appointed leaded has told the others that he has over a million dollars from a robbery unfortunately the area he has buried it in is due to be flooded to make a reservoir in four days.On they journey the meet a variety of interesting characters; a blind oracle who tells them they will find treasure but not that which they expected, a man who had sold his soul to the devil to play the guitar, three very alluring sirens and a one eyed character played by John Goodman amongst others. Much of the story involves music, in fact at one point they even make a record to earn a few buck then unknown to them it becomes a hit.The story telling is superb as is the acting. While at times it feels more like a collection of incidents rather than a single story that is no bad thing as each incident that happens along the way is interesting and usually amusing.If you want to watch something a little bit different which contains little to offend and much to amuse then this could be the film for you.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
11,ma-cortes,Fun and entertaining Coen film with three convicts set out on an Odyssey-like journey through Depression-era bound for home,7,20 January 2016,"In the deep south during the 1930s , Ulysses (George Clooney) leads a chain escapee along with fellow escapees (John Turturro , Tim Blake Nelson) , all of them find themselves caught up in extraordinary situations . The three escaped convicts search for hidden treasure while merciless lawmen (Daniel Von Bargen , Royce D. Applegate) pursues them . Along the way the trio meets curious characters as the historical Baby Face Nelson (Michael Badalucco) who was a homicidal gangster named Lester M. Gillis, he was known for his hot temper and itchy trigger finger ; and Governor Pappy O'Daniel (Charles Druning) who is based on W. Lee (Pappy) O'Daniel, who served as Governor of Texas (not Mississippi) from 1939-41 and later as U.S. Senator . As the main starring getaways bound for home , where waits his wife Penny or Penélope (Holly Hunter) . Sometimes, you have to lose your way to get back home .¨O Brother, Where Art Thou?¨ is an enjoyable film by Cohen Brothers that packs thrills , dry humor , action , wonderful songs and numerous references to Homer's ""Odyssey"" . ""O Brother Where Art Thou?"" comes from the title of the movie-within-a-movie in Preston Sturges' Sullivan's travels (1941) . Starred by three rare characters suffering several Coanesque adventures ; what the trio encounter along the way are a number of surprising situations and weird roles that , when all is said and done , seem like just that individual incidents that never really add up to a whole plot . 3 Protagonists fit well enough to comprise a pretty agreeable yarn , though relies heavily on their peculiar and continuous relationship . The film includes characters or places with the stereotypes of the regions they take place in , as the Southern accents and dust-bowl landscape from Mississippi . The whole concept is loosely based on author Howard Waldrop's novella ""A Dozen Tough Jobs,"" which recounts the labors of Hercules in a similar Mississippi setting , albeit ten years earlier ; another possible link comes from the William Faulkner short novel, ""Old Man"" . Sympathetic acting by main stars accompanied by a magnificent plethora of secondaries as Charles Durning , Thomas King , Ray McKinnon , Lee Weaver , Ed Gale , Stephen Root , Musetta Vander , as well as Coen regulars as John Goodman and special mention for John Turturro . The picture had big success , being nominated for 2 Oscars and another 7 wins & 35 nominations and won five Grammys . Highly keen soundtrack by T Bone Burnett , in which mundane sounds are made to seem eerie or used for absurd effect . George Clooney practiced his singing for weeks, but in the end his singing voice was dubbed by country blues singer Dan Tyminski . The film's soundtrack became an unlikely blockbuster, even surpassing the success of the film . By early 2001, it had sold five million copies , spawned a documentary film, three follow-up albums . Colorful as well as evocative cinematography by Roger Deakins , Coen's usual , the whole film was graded digitally on computer , the negative was scanned and then colors were digitally fine-tuned .The motion picture was well written and directed by Joel and Ethan Coen . They have shared these duties on all of their films, but Joel has always been listed as director and Ethan as producer . The first Coen brothers film where both he and brother Ethan Coen are given directing and producing credits was Ladykillers (2004). Both of whom are part of the prestigious group of individuals to have won Oscars for writing , directing and producing in the same year, for the film No Country for Old Men (2007). Their career is splendid from first film : Blood simple (1984) to Arizona Baby (1987), Miller's crossing (1990) , Barton Fink (1991), the great Lebowski (1998), The Man Who Wasn't There (2001) , Intolerable Cruelty (2003) , Burn After Reading (2008) , A Serious Man (2009) , True grit (2010) ,among others .","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
12,BA_Harrison,The Coens done good.,8,2 January 2020,"Loosely based on Homer's Odyssey, the Coen Brothers' 'O Brother, Where Art The hou?' is the saga of Everett, Pete and Delmar (George Clooney, John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson), three bumbling criminals on the run in the deep south, hoping to dig up a hidden stash of treasure before the valley where it is buried is flooded. At the start of their journey, they meet a blind man who prophecises that they will find a fortune, though it will not be the one they seek; indeed, life for the trio takes many strange and unexpected turns before fate smiles upon them, their adventure involving encounters with many unusual characters (including three sirens, a Bible-selling conman, a bluesman who has sold his soul to the devil, infamous bank robber Babyface Nelson, and the KKK).Combining smart witticisms with superb slapstick and American folklore, the Coens have crafted a sparkling comedic delight, helped no end by excellent performances, not just from the three endearing leads, but everyone involved, the superb supporting cast including such wonderful talent as John Goodman, Holly Hunter, and Charles Durning. The film also benefits from stunning photography (much of it sepia-tinted to add to the depression-era ambience) and a superb soundtrack bristling with 'Old Time America' bluegrass and country music (if you're not already a fan of the genre, you might well be by the end of the film), making it a treat for both eyes and ears. If only the film had smell-o-vision, so we could appreciate the odour of Ulysses' Dapper Dan pomade as well...","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
13,moonspinner55,"Handsome production, but awkward, detached serio-comedy isn't too funny...",3,5 July 2006,"Terrific production and a good comedic performance by George Clooney can't save curiously detached, occasionally clumsy quasi-comedy from Joel and Ethan Coen. Depression-era road tale hearkens back to yesterday with three escaped chain-gang prisoners seeking a hidden fortune, and inadvertently becoming country music stars in the process! The film meanders along but never builds any momentum. It does get a big boost from Clooney's charismatic, Gableesque mugging, and also from the art direction and T-Bone Burnett's lively music. Otherwise, the screenplay (by the Coens) is seriously lacking in humor and interest, supporting cameos by John Goodman and Holly Hunter fail to add any lift, and the second-half of the movie slides precariously into self-indulgence. ** from ****","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
14,Quinoa1984,a rollicking good time,10,31 December 2000,"The Coen Brothers (them being Joel and Ethan) have a pretty good film here; recommendable to say the least. If it's not one of their very best it might be because it goes for so much within the framework of the Odyssey that it threatens to run off the tracks. But there's a great deal of originality here too, from the KKK musical number to the tommy-gunned cows to the horny-toad mystery following the ""sirens"", to a great final hoe-down involving men with fake beards. It's crazy, and it works most of the time. It's an odyssey inspired by Homer, though it isn't exactly ""based"" on it; from what I described up above it's really a jumping off point, as if the brothers took what they remembered from the story after reading it in school, and then put on their own ideas for the characters based on who could best play them. The film takes place in 1930's Mississippi where 3 convicts (Tim Blake Nelson, John Tuturro and in a Clark Gable-like face, George Clooney) escape to go look for a hidden treasure, but, like in the original Homer odyssey, there are their sidetracks (sirens) and villains (John Goodman does a good job as this villain). About the 4th best Coen brothers movie you can find, with some enjoyable comedy and some ironic moments. Definitely fun and with some memorable tunes. A-","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
15,Coventry,The terrific odyssey of the Soggy Bottom Boys,8,27 January 2004,"SPOILERS! The Coen brothers have done it again! In a time where cinematic art and inspiration never ceases to reach new lows, they manage to deliver extremely funny and original film adventures. With their amazing sense of subtle humor and their unique talent of storytelling, the bros present us yet another triumph in a complete series of highlights.  Not one film of the Coens fails to satisfy the audience and that makes them the greatest directors alive at the moment. O Brother Where Art Thou deserves most of its praising thanks to the sublime structure and the terrific atmosphere. The story takes plays in the depressing 30's and the rural way of living in this decade is transferred to the screen terrifically. A convicted prisoner escapes but he has to drag along two other (not so bright) prisoners because they're chained together. The makes them believe there is a buried treasure waiting for them if they stick together. They do find many adventures on their way indeedO Brother is filled with eccentric and hilarious personalities and each of them has a bunch of bizarre characteristics. Our three meet a lunatic bank robber who's merely looking for fame instead of fortune, a well mouthed Bible salesman who doesn't seem to be so religious after all, a threesome of wicked but lovely sirens, a guitar player who sold his soul to the devil and  top of the bill  they have to face an entire group of the Ku-Klux-Klan! The often melodramatic and depressing subjects are presented with an overload of humor and sarcasm, which makes the whole film very unique and typically Coen Brothers. The three heroes' even record their own hit and grow to be famous without even knowing it!! George Clooney gives away his best performance ever as Ulysess Everett McGillhis charismatic charm and sublime vocabulary fits this movie so well. John Turturro is a regular cast for the Coen brother and no doubt that he does his best work under them. Very good side roles for John Goodman and Holly Hunter (also frequently cast by the Coens) as well. In short, few movies come with such high recommendation as O Brother Where Art Thou. If you appreciate good cinema, you'll love this film. Just like all the Brother's movies by the way.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
16,michaelRokeefe,Hillbilly hi-jinks. Bluegrass music. Laugh out loud funny!,7,16 February 2002,"The Coen Brothers have done it again. Three depression era convicts(George Clooney, John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson)escape a Mississippi chain gang and head off in search of buried treasure that will fund their new lives. Along the way, they sing on the radio and become much sought after stars as well as escapees. Great laughs and a soundtrack that is a lesson/introduction to bluegrass music.Clooney is outstanding as the fast talking, quick witted Ulysses Everett McGill. Holly Hunter plays his estranged wife. Turturro and Nelson are flawless stumblebums. Also in the cast are John Goodman and Charles Durning.Dan Tyminksi provides the singing voice for George Clooney on ""I Am A Man of Constant Sorrow"", the Soggy Bottom Boys song that serves as a template for the bluegrass laden soundtrack that also features Alison Krauss, Ralph Stanley, The Whites, John Hartford, The Cox Family and Gillian Welch. Toe tapping, knee slapping fun for the whole family. You'll be surprised with how relaxed and funny this movie is.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
17,jotix100,The Odyssey according to the Coen brothers,8,1 September 2005,"The Coen brothers are probably America's most creative minds in recent years as shown by the many projects they have brought for our benefit in order to entertain us. As with all creative persons, some films are extraordinary, some are excellent, and a few miss the mark. Having seen the film in its original release, we were fortunate to see again in DVD format recently. With ""O Brother, Where Art Thou"", the Coens are at their best. Joel and Ethan Coen gathered one of the best group of performers to be in the film. George Clooney is seen as Ulysses, or Odysseus in the Greek epic, the man at the center of the action. Never has this actor been given this great opportunity and he has responded in ways that bowled us in watching him portray his character on the screen. To say this is his best work in the movies, is perhaps not saying anything at all! Mr. Clooney can thank the Coens for trusting in him and giving him the role of his career.The rest of the cast is perfection. Most of the players are part of the Coen's troupe of talented players at their disposal to give life to their characters in film. John Turturro, John Goodman and Holly Hunter have been in other films by the brothers and shine in this movie. Tim Blake Nelson, Charles Durning, Del Pentecost, and Daniel Von Bargen, among others do extraordinary work for the Coen team.The musical score by T Bone Burnett is what makes this movie unique. The use of the music works so well with the film as does Mr. Clooney's singing. Roger Deakins' cinematography also adds a rich texture to the story. A must see for all Coen brothers fans!","O Brother, Where Art Thou"

Yes, I am still cutting grass the last week of November.The cinematography and music in this film is a delight in itself, but the characters are just a thrill to watch.John Goodman. a Coen Brother's favorite, Holly Hunter as the wife, Charles Durning as the Governor and his crazy crew, and, of course, Mia Tyler, Musetta Vander, and Christy Taylor as the Sirens.Baby Face Nelson, the KKK, and Mississippi politics all rolled into a fun movie.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"

I expected a weird movie with a typical style similar to maybe a Tim Burton movie. The movie however had a very easy to watch style which makes this movie very accessible to watch for all people.The story is filled with some wonderful and comical situations and not so likely characters.The cast does a very good job although in my opinion George Clooney was at times overacting a little. Holly Hunter is always a pleasure to watch and I really loved her in this movie. Two fun small unforgettable parts are played John Goodman and Michael Badalucco. I also enjoyed seeing Wayne Duvall in this movie, I never really liked him as an actor in his role in ""The District"" but he really impressed me in this movie.A very fun and stylish, easy to watch, movie.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
20,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Not sure what to make of it...,7,14 August 2005,"The Coen brothers continually astound me... and I'm not sure if that is a good thing. Every time I think I've figured them or their films out, they pull one over on me. The Hudsucker Proxy had some great humor, but was mostly a homage to old comedies. Fargo was somewhat weird and oddly repetitive, but had plenty of great humor. The Man Who Wasn't There is an excellent noir film. Intolerable Cruelty was very funny. All of them had great writing and dialog. Then, around comes this... what is it, anyway? A fresh interpretation of The Odyssey? The film revolves around Everett, a man on the run from the law with the other two thirds of his chain gang. He goes through many trials and tribulations throughout the just over 90 minutes the film lasts, until the conflict is finally resolved. The plot is fine, but there seems to be a nearly unlimited number of characters that just show up, serve their purpose and disappear. The pacing is daft. The characters are fairly well-written and credible. The dialog and script is well-written, as is expected from the Coen's. The acting is very good all-round. The humor works some of the time. The quirkiness of some characters makes for some good laughs, but that's about it. All in all, a fairly forgettable Coen brothers' film. I recommend this to fans of the Coen brothers and the actors involved. Fine for a single viewing. 7/10","O Brother, Where Art Thou"

23,ferguson-6,"O Plot, Where Art Thou?",8,5 February 2001,"Greetings again from the darkness.  Another quirky experience from the Coen's, who have provided some of my favorite moviegoing moments.  ""Blood Simple"" and ""Fargo"" are classics, and ""The Hudsucker Proxy"" ""Miller's Crossing"" and ""Barton Fink"" are right behind.  I was never a fan of ""Raising Arizona"", but this similar film has some really great touches.  No one casts more brilliantly than the Coens.  Not a fan of George Clooney, but he is outstanding in his role.  Many Coen regulars make their appearances (Holly Hunter, John Goodman, John Turturro) but I loved Tim Blake Nelson as Delmar. My favorite bits include the spoofs on legendary guitarist Robert(called Tommy in the film) Johnson selling his soul to the devil at the crossroads, and infamous bank robber George Nelson's (wonderfully played by Son of Sam actor Michael Badalucco) reaction to being called ""Baby Face"". As a film lover, I trust the Coens to push the envelope every time out.  Weak story in this one, but truly enjoyable nonetheless.  The funniest part is that after seeing this film, people are buying the soundtrack!  T Bone Burnett does a remarkable job of making one want to purchase a hillbilly CD.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
24,Wuchakk,Amusing rural Mississippi odyssey in the 30s,6,22 July 2021,"During the Depression, three guys escape a chain gang in Mississippi (George Clooney, Tim Blake Nelson and John Turturro) to experience many misadventures with a blind prophet, a gifted musician (Chris Thomas King), a radio station, baby-face Nelson (Michael Badalucco), baptism in a river, ""sirens,"" a one-eyed Bible salesmen (John Goodman), an ex-wife (Holly Hunter), the KKK, corrupt politicians and an area with hidden treasure about to be flooded.A Coen brothers film, ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" (2000) is a farcical odyssey taking place in the Deep South of the 1930s. The cast is entertaining, which also includes the likes of Daniel von Bargen. It's quirky and amusing augmented by its setting and locations, not to mention one of my wife's favorite movies (possibly because Clooney was in his prime). In ways, it's like ""Deliverance"" (1972) if it were a comedy, just mixed with ""Cool Hand Luke"" (1967) and a dash of Homer's Odyssey.I like it, but don't love it; it's fun, no doubt, but also kinda forgettable. Yet the song ""I Am a Man of Constant Sorrow"" is well done and catchy.The film runs 1 hour, 47 minutes, and was shot mostly in Mississippi, plus some stuff done at Universal Studios.GRADE: B-","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
25,zetes,By Far the Worst Movie the Coen Brothers Have Ever Done,7,19 January 2001,"Like many people, I first became associated with the Coen brothers through Fargo. They might have been the first filmmakers whose entire body of work I searched out and watched. And I liked every one of them. And then I was the first person in line to see their next film (their previous film now) The Big Lebowski. And that one just added to their shining reputation.
And now, some three and a half or so years later, comes their next film, O Brother, Where Art Thou? It has all the marks of a Coen brothers' movie, but, for some reason, it doesn't work at all. And I know why, or at least I think I do. What makes a Coen brothers' film distinct from a film of another director? Some would say quirkiness. This is certainly part of it. But people can copy quirkiness, and have. Take Being John Malkovich. It is possibly the quirkiest film ever made outside of the Coen universe. But no one would mistake it for a Coen brothers' film. Why is this? Well, in my opinion, which, of course, is informed, it is the Coen brothers' sense of perfection and meticulousness both in the technical aspects, the performances, and the script. Technically, O Brother is a match for any of their other films. The cinematography, mise-en-scene, sound and editing are great. The script is the biggest problem. It is bad. Not that there aren't good ideas in there. In fact, any one of the episodes could have turned out to be hilarious. Possibly, its just that there are too many episodes. Therefore, each episode runs for approximately two minutes before it is over. Each episode comprises about one sequence, and each sequence is composed of about two or three scenes. Take a look at Miller's Crossing, for example, to compare. The pace is slow. O Brother is not a short movie, yet it feels that way. And because of the sloppy script, there are no performances to speak of, really. I like any one of the actors on screen, but their characters, even the character of George Clooney, are all one dimensional. It isn't necessary to flesh out every character of a comedy, but I think some of the more colorful supporting characters should have had more screentime, more development. John Goodman should have had a more substantial part, for instance (although his Southern accent is not very good), and Charles Durning's part should have been better. In fact, the whole gubernatorial race part of the plot should have been more in focus. I would have based the plot more around it, rather than having it taking place in the corners. The way the Coens get rid of Durning's opponent is just bad.
The only thing the film did get right is the music. The main song that the escapees sing is just marvelous. And all the other songs written by T. Bone Burnett are excellent, also. In fact, it would be a travesty if at least that main song didn't get nominated for an Oscar. It completely deserves it. I would have given the film an all-time Coen brothers low score of 4/10, 7/10 being the former low (The Hudsucker Proxy), but I have to give it at least one point for the music, so final score = 5/10.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
26,SimonJack,"Early 20th century setting for ""The Odyssey""",7,22 November 2016,"""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" is a disjointed comedy film that takes place in the American South of the early 20th century. Brothers Joel and Ethan Coen wrote, produced and directed the movie, intending it as a modern version of Homer's ""Odyssey."" The film mixes serious social problems of time and place, with humor and somewhat with a nod to lesser crimes. In an interview, Joel said it was a Three Stooges film. The acting is good, with George Clooney, John Turturro and Tim Nelson in the lead roles as Everett, Pete and Delmar, respectively. John Goodman has a smooth-talking violent part as Big Dan Teague. Charles Durning gives one of the best performances as the governor of Mississippi, Pappy O'Daniel. The movie pokes fun at the type of politics of the time, and at the Ku Klux Klan and at good ole Southern religion. The songs and singing are some of the best part of the humor. Some viewers may be put off by the considerable amount of profanity. I noted one thing curious about this movie. It was entered in the Cannes Film Festival in May of 2000, and then released in France on August 30 of that year. It was released all over Europe and elsewhere through 2000, but didn't make it to screens in the U.S. until February 2, 2001. This isn't a movie to rush out and buy. But, it's fair entertainment, with the reservations noted above, for adults on an evening when one doesn't have a great film or more interesting movie to watch.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"

I remember traveling in the South and seeing these men in chains along the side of the road and thought what a horrible punishment in the hot steamy sun and the great physical pain the men had to endure. George Clooney(Ulysses Everett McGill) along with John Turturro(Pete) gave excellent drama and comedy with their great acting skills.  However, John Goodman(Big Dan Teague) with a one-eyed patch and a suppose to be ""Bible Salesman"" gave some good punches to Ulysses over a picnic lunch.   Charles Durning (Gov. Pappy) shook his big round bottom along with Ulysses to all the Western Tunes and even cut a Top Hit Country Western Song.

I'm not into the southern theme type of movies nor did I ever get into The Odessey. I'm also in no way interested in Country music; and George Clooney. But surprisingly, O Brother turned out to be a fantastic movie that I was completely wrong about and am so glad to have given it a chance.The acting and story line is just so great and both my mom and I surprising loved the music! It's just such a great feel good movie with great comedic moments. This is definitely is worth a watch and a buy for anyone.

30,=G=,Good old fashioned fun uniquely Coen.,8,13 June 2001,"""O Brother"" is a meandering comedy set in 1930's Mississippi which tells of the misadventures of three chain-gang escapees. A highly original and creative piece of work, the film amuses, taunts, and teases as it delivers a cleverly crafted script, some unique characters, and simple fun with little fanfare. As with other Coen flicks, the hype is after the premier and comes from the audience...the best kind. Good fun most likely to be appreciated or understood by mature folks...people who remember pomade, spittoons, sparkling oil, and phosphates. Did that car really hit the cow?","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
31,MovieAddict2016,Huh?,4,1 September 2002,"Why does everyone like this film, and what is it with all these 'creative' films. I thought it was weird, only a bit funny, and maybe worth seeing once. I wouldn't highly recommend it though! 2.5/5 stars--","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
32,MovieAddict2016,"O Cohesion, Where Art Thou?",4,2 December 2003,"I haven't seen many of the Coen Brothers' films, although one of the two I have seen is one of my favorites (""Fargo""), and the other I've seen is one I don't care for very much (""O Brother, Where Art Thou?""). One of the films has a lot of humor, the other doesn't. One of the films is extremely entertaining; the other is just sort of boring.""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" is a retelling of Homer's ""Odyssey,"" or ""Homer's Odyssey,"" since you never see the title without the name preceding it anymore; Homer's name is practically part of the title, now. Am I digressing? It starts with three runaway convicts, Ulysses Everett McGill (George Clooney), Pete (John Turturro), and Delmer (Tim Blake Nelson). Everett - as his chumps call him - has a strange fascination with his own hair, and Dapper Dan hair cream. ""I'm a Dapper Dan Man!"" he proclaims after being offered another brand of hair cream by a store clerk (who unfortunately doesn't carry Dapper Dan but looks as if he couldn't give a hoot either way). And, in another one of the film's few funny scenes, we see local police picking up a trail on the threesome after a bloodhound finds a tin can of Dapper Dan and a hairnet lying by a diminished fire.The trio has escaped from jail in hopes of finding an ancient treasure not delved into by the film so very much. Along the way they meet an odd assortment of characters, including a black guitarist who sold his soul to Satan so that he could learn to play guitar; a baby-faced criminal trying to make a name for himself; and a bulky thief (John Goodman) who steels what little fortunes the men have achieved by singing on the radio under the combined name of The Soggy Bottom Boys.Along the way they also encounter Everett's wife (Holly Hunter), who claims he was hit by a train, tells her seven children this, and refuses to acknowledge him as her husband. With the law in hot pursuit of them, the boys have only their brains to fall back on - and they don't have much of that available for use.The plot's not the problem with the film (per se). It has fun with itself; the bluegrass music is perfect for the film and makes you feel like you're in Mississippi. The problem is the way the film has a million different ideas going on that it never seems able to make sense of. The film takes spiritual detours that pay off at the end, but nothing is ever truly resolved. In one scene towards the overdue finale, Everett gets down on his knees and prays to God to deliver them from their doom. Suddenly a gigantic tidal wave roars through and demolishes their surroundings, leaving them alive and bobbing on the water's surface.I've read ""The Odyssey,"" but even with all its weirdness in mind I don't remember it being this weird. It's been a while, yes, but I don't remember a giant tidal wave and I certainly don't think it belongs in a feature film with enough wasted ideas. At least `The Odyssey' was weird for a reason  `O Brother, Where Art Thou?' could certainly do without the strangeness.Every time George Clooney is on-screen you'll be having some minimal amount of fun at least, but when he's gone and the film takes its time rooting through some unimportant sub-plots, it gets to be a real bore. It's not even two hours long but it feels like it's three.The plus side? Depression-era Mississippi comes alive, and in some scenes the dry filming makes you thirsty for a glass of cold water. Not only that, but just as in ""Fargo,"" the Coen Brothers are able to make us feel a sort of attachment to the characters - but even with Everett's funny infatuation with hair gel, he's not in the same league as Marge Gunderson, and he never will be.The first time I saw this movie in 2000 (the year of its release), I absolutely hated it. Back then, perhaps I was expecting something too close to ""Fargo."" Maybe I just wanted something better. So with last night's repeat viewing, I made sure I wasn't expecting anything. I made sure I put away all pretensions. It still didn't impress me.""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" does have some good parts, but for being a comedy it certainly doesn't have very many laughs, and for being a lightweight, uplifting drama it seems too caught up in darker ideas that don't need meddling with. And, apart from everything else, it's just plain weird. It's a whole lot different than ""Fargo,"" which might sound good since change is often welcomed from director(s). But whereas M. Night Shyamalan's ""Signs"" was different than ""The Sixth Sense"" in a delightfully splendid way, ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" is sort of like George Lucas' latest installments into the extended ""Star Wars"" series. They may be different, but they're definitely not any better.2.5/5 stars.John Ulmer","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
33,thesar-2,D'Oh! The Misadventures of Brother Simpson,3,26 July 2010,"Today's color, kids, is Brown. Boring, tan-tinted BROWN. Hope you like that color, because in today's video presentation of the old Depression-Age, you'll see a lot of it.Unfortunately, I don't like that color. Nor the color of the blues.Coffee's an acquired taste and so is the ever strange O Brother, Where Art Thou? Both I get, I'm not blind or lack taste buds. So, I understand the need for such substance from either source. But, since this is a matter of opinion and not a fact-based article..PHOOEY!Not everyone likes Adam Sandler, but if you do, chances are you don't like Jim Carrey and the reverse is also true. Comedy is very subjective. Here, I understood the slapstick and the screwballness of it all, but it wasn't my cup of brown, brown tea. I did not laugh once, but I admired the actor's balls for following the Coens wherever they wanted to lead. Including Clooney.Though he only started the movie on a different track from his normal performances, unfortunately, about half-way through, if you can get past the dirt on his face, you'll see the Clooney you've always seen. In addition, neither John Turturro (or Goodman) or the Coens change either. It was business as usual for them. They even had to throw in some classic Coens: Animal Cruelty.Three prisoners escape a real chain gang in the Depression Era – no not the late 2000's – and they're on a mission for gold. Along the way they meet goofball characters, do goofball things and sing aokay, good song.Sure, there's search for them there Goldor an ulterior motive. That's not that much of a spoiler – anyone who knows what this is based on should see where this is headed.And with that: They say this movie's based on Homer's Odyssey. I doubt the original text/poem, for which I have, in fact read, was meant to be this ridiculed. Heck, where was that Jim Carrey to step in and start singing? To watch this, you'll have to like the Blues. You'll have to like George Clooney. Wackiness. Barely a character to root for. And the color brown.Sorry, I just can't get over that brownish, tanish tint over 98% of the movie. Nor could I get over this incredibly array of wacky characters, so out of left field, it's distracting.Again, I get what they were trying to say and covey, but it just wasn't my bag. So, since I know it has a select audience, and you might be part of that – if you agree with what I wrote about what the film's about, I can't completely down-rate the movie to 1 star. At least I am able to acknowledge it does, in fact, have a following. More power to those who like it, I'm just not part of that group.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
34,ElMaruecan82,"O Coen Brothers, Where Were You?...",6,9 September 2016,"Praising a Coen brothers' movie because it has style is like praising an ice cream because it's cold, there's got to be more. ""O Brother Where Art Thou"" has all the style a fan of the directing siblings can ask for, but a little more substance wouldn't have hurt the film.Talent is a double-edged sword, the more you prove yourself capable to surprise the viewers, to mesmerize them, to please their eyes and challenge their intellect, the more they expect from your next creation. And after ""Fargo"", perhaps the most universally acclaimed Coen brothers' movie and ""The Big Lebowksy"", a bizarre take on the noir genre whose brilliance sprung lately in our minds, came ""O Brother Where Art Thou"". Watching it, I want to ask the two Coens ""O Brothers, Where Were You?"" A Coen brothers' comedy is an offer you can't refuse, but there are many ways to play comedy, goofy and borderline-parody like in ""Raising Arizona"", surrealistic and over-the-top like in ""The Big Lebowsky"", bleak and engrossing like in ""Barton Fink"" and ""A Serious Man"", or dark and atmospheric like in ""Fargo"", even in the so-called dramatic movies, there was also a few scenes to channel their wicked twisted of humor. But as far as comedy is concerned, the case of ""O'Brother Where Art Thou"" is puzzling, it obviously tries to play on the ""Raising Arizona"" level with the atmosphere of ""Sullivan's Travels"" in the background, but the humor never really manages to hit that special chord so that you can follow the story with the confidence that this is going to be one hell of a belly-laugh ride.And it's even more puzzling because the film actually got the casting right, the first shot with the three fugitives from a chain gang running and ducking in the midst of a cornfield is like borrowed from a 30's cartoon, it successfully sets the tone, something in the line of ""Of Mice and Men"" and Tex Avery. George Clooney is a 'clowny' version of George crossed with a Clark Gable wannabe, his name is Everett, John Turturro is Pete, a sort of Lenny without the good heart, and Tim Blake Nelson is Delmar, a pint-sized Lenny without the strength, and none of Turturro or Nelson even tries to steal Clooney's thunder, which leaves him enough space to display his comical abilities. But there's not much given to him. For instance, there's one part where Pete asks Everett why he's the boss, Everett proposes a vote. Pete proposes himself so it all comes to Delmar, there's no time for him to come with a funny line, their first encounter: a black blind man driving a handcar on a railway.And this is only one of the many colorful tropes of the Great Depression era, a time, full of pastoral melancholy immortalized by so great classics, interestingly many road movies: ""The Grapes of Wrath"", ""Bonnie and Clyde"", ""Bound for Glory"", a time made popular through bluegrass music, the sounds of banjo, sepia tones and so many visually appealing details that it's no wonder the Coen brothers decided to venture into this chapter of America and where else than Mississippi could they complete the picture with pies, long railroads, hobos in freighters, a governor who look like the KFC old man and Klan rallies? A Depression film is no depressing premise, not when it is tackled by the Coen brothers and cinematographer Roger Deakings. So what went wrong exactly? Well, the film is said to be adapted from Homer's Odyssey. While it gives the film a certain edge, it doesn't really add much to the story as the Coen brothers reckoned they didn't read the book, so why handicapping a great premise with a needless framework. Are the Coens so uninspired they couldn't make a story of their own? In fact they did, because nothing really evokes the Odyssey apart from the Sirens' encounter, Penny, the wife, played by Holly Hunter is obviously Penelope, with her knitting habit, but what do they add up besides simply 'reminding' of the Odyssey. Take the sirens part, what does that part offer except from the recognition that they are the Sirens? I believe the film would have been more interesting had they stuck to an original screenplay, with so many great characters, they could. But the film was just so busy loosely imitating a never-read book that it created a series of events, enjoyable in their own terms but so inconsistent that even the resolutions feels a bit artificial and unconvincing.At the end, we enjoy it for the stars, the atmosphere (some religious moments are haunting), the performances of John Goodman as Bible salesman and governor Charles Durning as Papy O'Daniel and naturally, the defining song of the film ""A Man of Constant Sorrow"". I would lie if I said the film wasn't enjoyable, every single department is well done but something is lacking in the whole. %aybe if it was made by other directors, we would have been less critical, the fact is the film was made after ""The Big Lebowksy"" and it just didn't compare. Still, as a minor offering, ""Brother' is never as good as when it takes departure from the whole Odyssey's outline and its homage to ""Sullivan's Travels"", a film I didn't even like in the first place. Maybe that's why I'm so critical?Nah it's precisely because I have been so admiring of most of the Coen brothers' works that I allow myself to say this one made me a viewer of constant sorrow.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
35,paul2001sw-1,Distinctive and daft,7,25 September 2007,"Whether or not you actually like them, no-one could accuse the Coen brothers' films of not being distinctive. 'O Brother Where Art Thou' is a zany, indeed stupid (although still highly enjoyable) comedy about a hair-gel obsessed prison escapee (played by George Clooney), set in a lovingly created bastardisation of the depression-era American South, underpinned by the music of that time (and the music, surprisingly, is treated with some reverence, however farcical the other elements of the movie). To its credit, it's funny, and quite unlike any other film you'll have seen before. To its detriment, as with a lot of other Coen films, it's not especially emotionally engaging, and there's little in the way of coherent plot, just a ramble through the brothers' strange imagination. As for the claim in the opening credits that it's based on Homer's odyssey, there are some nods in this direction, but don't expect anything too literal; just remember that 'Fargo' was ""based on a true story"" in the same fashion.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
36,gbill-74877,"Funny, and evokes an era",8,14 September 2020,"I've always liked this Coen Bros. production - the fantastic folk music, the Americana applied to an inverted version of The Odyssey, and those three lovable convicts on the run (George Clooney, John Turturro, and good old Tim Blake Nelson as dimwitted Delmar). The moment they become the Soggy Bottom Boys singing into a ""can"" always makes me smile, as do all of their little idiosyncrasies, like the loquaciousness of Clooney's character and his penchant for Dapper Dan pomade. I didn't care for the subplot involving the politician quite as much, but it does allow another dimension to the satire of racism, showing the Reform candidate to be a part of the Klan, and the incumbent to then gleefully take advantage of his missteps, without really caring for people of color in the slightest. The film has a great look and feel to it, and even though the story is contrived, the comedy comes through and it evokes an era.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
37,g-bodyl,Interesting Film!,9,23 November 2012,"Well, the Coen brothers made another interesting film to add to their directing repertoire. This is somewhat more mainstream then their previous films but that's not saying much. This film still has the delightful quirky feeling that their movies seem to feature. Despite some preachiness and a weird music score to this film, I really had to like a film like this.This film is about three prisoners who escape and they go on an ""Odyssey"" like adventure to reclaim treasure before the wealth gets flooded away.George Clooney is one heck of an actor. He chooses his roles very wisely(other than Batman and Robin of course) and that's why the Academy loves him so much. The rest of the cast led by Turturro and Blake Nelson were superb.Overall, this movie feels like a cross between ""The Three Stooges"" and ""the Odyssey."" There are some adventures here that feature sirens and cyclops figuratively speaking and a trio of unintelligent delinquents. But, this a very fun Coens movie albeit a little more mainstream.

41,ironhorse_iv,"O Brother, this movie is a masterpiece! I love it!",8,29 May 2016,"Written and directed by the Coen Brothers, ""O Brother Where Art thou"", tells the story of three Depression-era Mississippi prison fugitives Ulysses Everett McGill (George Clooney), Pete Hogwallop (John Turturro) and Delmar O'Donnel (Tim Blake Nelson) on a journey to reach for the money buried in Everett's backyard, before that area slated to be flooded by a local dam project. Without spoiling the film, too much, I like the fact that entire plot contains various shout outs to the Ancient Greek poem, 'The Odyssey' by author, Homer. While the film doesn't follow, the poem to the letter, it does borrow some notable plot elements from it, such as the blind man, the Cyclops, the sirens, and one of the main characters trying to get home to his wife so she won't marry someone else. The connections to the poem can get pretty clever the more you look for them. A good example is how Everett is surrounded by Peter and Delmar, which in Greek, means 'the rock' and 'the sea', referencing to the Charybdis and Scylla in the original poem. Even the term ""odyssey"" in the original Greek can be roughly translated to ""Constant Sorrow"" which is aptly, the title of the song that identifies our heroes. Although the fictional story is mostly based off, 'The Odyssey', the canvas of the film come from the fictional book/McGuffin of the same name in Preston Sturges' 1941 film, 'Sullivan's Travels'. Since that socially-conscious novel has never been define with any sense of a story, besides some downtrodden themes taken from author John Steinbeck, 1932's film, 'I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang', William Faulkner's novel, 'As I Lay Dying' and the Holy Bible; it allows, the Coen Brothers to draw their own creative artistic license to make whatever was, 'O Brother Where Art Thou' supposed to mean. One of those prominent themes is the idea of change. In this film, spiritualism is seem as a backward belief, made for laughs, that it's not needed for the more modern and technologically advanced. However, given the ambivalence with which the movie treats the idea of reform, and perhaps Everett's change of heart, toward the end. It is ultimately left to the viewer to decide whether the vast reform of America brought about by technology is, itself, a step-backwards or a step forwards. I like that, about this film. Another thing, I like, is how this film is almost a musical. In many ways, the Coen Brothers really wanted to make a period piece version of the 1980s comedy film, 'Blue Brothers'. This comedy choice in direction allows the movie to have fun with the sophistical meaning of the themes, without going all grim and somber. While, this movie might not have the action that 'Blue Brothers' has, this movie has nearly the same style of music. Both films emphasize the power that gospel and bluegrass music has on its characters, both in positive and negative ways. There is no better example of that, then the 'Down in the River to pray' & 'Go to Sleep Little Baby' (Didn't Leave Nobody but the Baby) sequences. Both songs are able to shown, the struggles of being sinful while, also righteous. Great singing from bluegrass singers, Alison Krauss Emmylou Harris, & Gillian Welch. I also love the other songs on the soundtrack, including music artist, Harry McClintock's 'Big Rock Candy Mountain', Norman Blake's 'You are my sunshine' and 'In the Jailhouse now' by Tim Blake Nelson. Yet, the best song, in the film, has to be, Soggy Bottom Boys (Dan Tyminski, Harley Allen, and Pat Enright) 'I Am a Man of Constant Sorrow'. It really tells, how life was like, during one of the most downtrodden period of American history. The notable use of dirges and other macabre songs in this film is wonderful. Hearing dark songs like ""O Death"", ""Angel Band"", in contrast to bright, cheerful songs ""Keep On the Sunny Side"", ""In the Highways"" in other parts of the film, make this film, one of the best movie soundtrack ever. This film really shows, how extreme poverty can indeed foster, a rich musical tradition of classic hits. Another great thing about this film is how well-shot, it was. One of the notable features of the film is its use of digital color correction to give the film a sepia-tinted look. If they didn't do this, the Southern summer landscape would have been a bright green, which is too cheerful for the Dust Bowl-type feel they were going for. Director of photography, Roger Deakins really did a wonderful job, capturing that time period. Another thing that I love about this film, is the acting. Everybody in the film, ranging from supporting actors, to the main actors were great in their roles. Mad props goes to George Clooney for making this film, a lot of fun. I have always love, his fun comedy side, better than his dramatic roles. It just sucks, that he can't sing, worth jack. It's a little more tragic, because he's from a line of well-known singers, like famed cabaret singer and actress Rosemary Clooney. Anyways, due of his lack of skills in the music department, he had to be dubbed by Dan Tyminski, during any part, where singing was involved. The other faults of the film is that many characters are introduced and then disappear seemingly without any point or purpose. Did we really need George 'Baby-Face' Nelson (Michael Badalucco) to cameo in the film? Wasn't he dead in 1939? That's another problem with the film. It's not historical correct, at all. The real Governor Pappy O' Daniels was a Texan, and the film's theme song, ""You are my Sunshine,"" was written by Louisiana's Depression-era governor, Jimmy Davis. However, since it's a fiction fantasy movie. I'm willing to give this, some leeway. Despite some faults, this movie is a bodafine classic. A must watch for any Coen Brothers fan. Overall: Go see it. I do recommended.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"

43,kenjha,Meandering Comedy,6,26 December 2012,"The Coen Brothers ought to be applauded for attempting to make a film out of ""The Oddyssey,"" but it goes about as well well as one would expect of a film made out of an ancient epic poem. It has its moments but the narrative is too meandering to hold together. Clooney is fine, as is the rest of the cast, but the comedy is too broad to make this anything more than a curiosity piece. The songs are tuneful, particularly ""The Man of Constant Sorrow."" The title of the film pays homage to the Preston Sturges classic ""Sullivan's Travels,"" in which Joel McCrea, tired of making fluff, aspires to make a serious film with this title.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
44,johnnyboyz,"O Coen Brothers, Where Art the real Thou?",5,15 November 2009,"The Coen Brother's 2000 film 'O Brother, Where Art Thou?' is too much of too many slightly to reasonably good ideas patched up and sprayed all over the screen at once. The film will cover so much ground in terms of the flicking between genres; grounded content; off-the-wall content and tacked on character development that it just all fuses together and comes away somewhat of a mess. With hindsight, we can all say that films like O Brother, Where Art Thou? represent one of two different sorts of films the Coen's have in them; some of their best pieces of work are restrained, looming, ominous and quite grim. However, they have this tendency to throw these sorts ingredients out the window from time to time, and just come up with 'stuff' (and I do mean 'stuff', in inverted commas) that's wacky; carefree; loud; trying too hard to be funny and just generally obnoxious.O Brother, Where Art Thou? is one of those films; a film that'll shoot all over the place with absolutely no shame whatsoever, encompassing musical numbers; bank heists; a general sense of chase as they run from authorities as well as an electoral campaign running on a separate equilibrium. Between the film beginning and ending, some pretty far reaching material will have unfolded within a pretty small proximity of area. The unfortunate thing is that we're never given a chance to take any of it in and we're never given much of a chance to pause and reflect. The film is in so much of a hurry to shift onto the next 'funny' or 'quirky' encounter with the next misfit that none of film's character's encounter hold any sort of dramatic weight, and thus, do not add up to anything. A little of O Brother, Where Art Thou?'s approach goes a long way.On paper, the film should've worked a lot better than it did: a Coen Brothers film about three escaped convicts in 1930s deep south America running from the law in the hope to un-earth some self proclaimed 'treasure' hidden out there somewhere, only one prisoner of whom knows its whereabouts. The additional catch is that they only have a few days to find it because where it's buried will be flooded shortly. Yes, Yes, Yes - hand me that premise in the hands of these two guys and I'd lap it up anytime, any-day. But somewhat annoyingly, what we get is a hodge-podge of a piece, a stumbling and fumbling picture attempting to create comedy out of a young man's simplistic mindset; a film that uncomfortably straddles the line between realism and escapism with its all-too coincidental chance encounters and general outrageous content blended in with its sharp attention to the three guys throughout as they need to change clothes, find food, garner money, discover places they can safely rest and be able to maintain a consistent speed of travel in whatever capacity.The three men out and on the run are Tim Blake Nelson's Delmer; John Turturro's Pete and another individual named Everett (Clooney), whose authoritarian presence dwarfs the other two somewhat by being the one claiming to know where the loot from a raided armoured van is hidden. Their road-movie inspired journey is introduced somewhat obviously, and somewhat crudely, by a camera shot which begins on ground level by a railway track before shamelessly craning upwards to encompass a the rest of the single railway track going off into the distance, thus informing us of the singular line voyage these leads will go on. This occurs mere seconds after some kind of prophetic blind man lays out the long and spiritual journey the characters are to go on from here. It's all very self-aware, all-very post-modern and all very silly.But what of the journey? For a film to adopt that singular line strand narrative arc, what happens certainly unfolds in the crudest and elementary of fashions. I don't think there's much sense that these characters have progressed an awful lot from the point their journey begins to the point the film rounds everything off. The Coen's play a couple of wild-cards to create the illusion that the characters do so, one of which occurs very early on when a local Christian congregation are baptising people in a river and two of the stow-away prisoners take up the chance to supposedly rid themselves of sin. But this is a stark and jarring occurrence that takes the character from one extreme item to another; the film's in a rush, and rather than allow these guys to bond and figure things out for themselves in terms of who they are and what they ought to be doing in life, one scene very early on prematurely thrusts certain leads from criminal/ex-prisoner to apparently reformed citizen.A lot of the quest can unfold in any order it likes; there's no flow or consistency to any of these guy's mis-adventures. An encounter with some sirens; a coming across a one-eyed conman; interactions with a bank robber; some altercations with the police – it's all loud, garbled nonsense and can unfold in any order you want it to while I found some of these wacky and outrageous encounters further pull me away from the focus of the leads and their supposed goal of finding the loot. Twinned with this is a somewhat disturbing overtone of gun-play, or gunfire made funny. Early on, a shotgun wielding kid will provoke a would-be humorous encounter with the criminals trying to get back on their feet; bank-robber Nelson's (Badalucco) eccentric attitude as he fires off Tommy Gun rounds I'm sure spawns a few laughs amongst others, while the exploding ammunition in the police truck probably does the same thing. But by the time a certain rug has been pulled from underneath us linked to the premise, and we've had a series of country and western warblings; I think we're just about ready for ""O Brother"" to end.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
45,filipemanuelneto,A worthy and successful effort.,6,24 June 2017,"Any film director who decides to try to use material of Homer, Ovid or another classic immediately deserves congratulations for the courage. Even if his effort wasn't positive he tried. I say that because I read Homer and I know how heavy this author can be. Its a kind of literature extremely difficult to adapt. The Coen Brother's went a step further: they took Homer to the cinema in a way that hardly resembles Homer. They put old Greek story into a new context, giving it a different shape. All done with the usual touch of sarcastic elegance that is the signature of these directors.The plot's main idea is simple but takes time to show itself: Everett Ulysses McGill is a convict who decides to flee his labor camp and try to prevent his fiancé from marrying another man. He takes two other prisoners who were fortunately chained together with him. Some moments of the film are very funny and the irony is always there. Sometimes we wonder where are the logic but the film quickly explains most of the illogical moments (except, perhaps, the hundreds of pomade cans that appear throughout the film, which I honestly don't quite understand). In contrary to some critics, I don't think reading ""Odyssey"" is important to understand this movie, although it helps us to notice some nebulous scenes. The work of the actors is well done but no actor overlaps George Clooney, almost unrecognizable, with an intense southern accent. Well, maybe Tim Blake Nelson is as good as Clooney, thanks to the naive way he played Delmar. Finally, a word of appreciation for the costumes and scenarios, absolutely faithful to the period in which everything happens, as well as the enveloping and animated soundtrack, that gives life to the story.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
46,Rectangular_businessman,A great film by the Cohen Brothers,10,23 September 2010,"A really enjoyable well-rounded film going experience with great music, great cast and plenty of laughter to go around. The film is about three chain gang prisoners who make a cunning escape while on work detail. George Clooney's character was particularly amusing what with his similarities to Garry Shandling (how's my hair?). I also didn't realize what a physical comedian John Turturro is, funniest thing I've seen him in yet! Without money (but seeking treasure) they embark upon a strange and comical journey. From becoming a recording act called the Soggy Bottom Boys to a bank robber to sirens...it's almost like Forrest Gump in a way I guess. The ridiculous cast of characters they stumble upon are surprising and enjoyable. It's a feel good movie despite the fact that so many things go wrong but in a Coen brothers sort of way. I don't think this was quite as awesome as The Big Lebowski but it's close, definitely one of their finest. The great thing about this film is that it does have something for everyone and I would recommend this to all.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
47,TheMovieDiorama,"O Brother, Where Art Thou is a rather unusual offbeat road picture that is somewhat entertaining.",7,27 February 2018,"I'm not entirely sure how to review this flick. Don't get me wrong, it was enjoyable but something was missing that prevented this from being great. Essentially three chain-mates, who crush rocks on a prison farm, escape in an attempt to find buried treasure. But, in typical Coen fashion, the group go from one crazy scenario to the other. Constantly. From recording a country song for some cash, to getting robbed by a one-eyed Bible Salesman. From being seduced by sexy sirens, to being disguised in KKK uniform. It's just crazy fun. But there is just something about the narrative that seems...off. Like I wasn't fully connected with this biblical journey that's filled with religious connotations. I mean heck, the main character is named Ulysses. I just...didn't get the purpose of the biblical context. As a road caper, it's extremely enjoyable with plenty of humorous moments. Boasted with energetic performances by Clooney, Nelson and Turturro. Great supporting cast as well with dependable performances from Goodman and Hunter. The scenarios that our characters are put under are also hilarious and instantly memorable. As simple as falling from a train is, it still produces a good laugh. Hence why I admire the simplicity that Joel Coen was going for. It's not over-the-top slapstick humour, it's all in the dialogue. The Coen brothers pump out scripts that are consistently witty for every film they produce. They are known for damn good dialogue and this film is no different. I just...couldn't get on board with the context and subtext that was conveyed. Just didn't work for me. But as a hilarious adventure road flick, it works on every level. Might need to re-watch it at a later date to truly appreciate this. Not the Coens most accessible film but still a good watch.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"

49,Movie_Muse_Reviews,Smartly captures the mythology of the Deep South through music,9,8 January 2016,"The Depression-era Deep South comes alive like mythological Ancient Greece in Joel and Ethan Coen's ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" An adaptation of Homer's ""Odyssey,"" the Coen brothers came to the realization that the folklore of the Deep South is the heart of American myth and tales of long journeys and they marry Homer's epic to this aesthetic in a way that respects the original story and American folklore while imbuing them with a semi-silly tone.The 1930s Mississippi setting also makes a difference; post-Civil War and pre-Civil Rights, the South is caught between past traditions and forces of change and the American Dream feels well out of reach yet not impossibly beyond grasping. The trio of escaped chain-gang convicts, Ulysses Everett McGill (George Clooney), Pete (John Turturro) and Delmar (Tim Blake Nelson) are in search of more than a million dollars that Everett has hidden back home, money that will change their lives. Their long journey takes varying episodic twists and turns as they encounter all manner of characters, good and evil.The heart and soul of the film, however, is its music. Folks songs, hymns, spirituals and more have both a pivotal role in the film in terms of plot, in addition to providing the mythical tone. Songs are often tied to strange turns of events in the story, such as three mysterious women singing along the river and enchanting the runaways (obvious parallel to the ""Odyssey""). The gang even picks up Tommy Johnson (Chris Thomas King), who went down to the crossroads and sold his soul to the devil to play guitar, the very legend that started blues music.The film's arrangement ""I Am a Man of Constant Sorrow,"" the song that the trio plus Johnson sing into a can for $10 under the pseudonym ""The Soggy Bottom Boys"" when they come across a blind radio producer (Stephen Root), proves strangely key to the story and is unbelievably catchy to boot. Music in the film, as it so often did in the South, brings people together and makes a difference. The Coens' film has as much to say about that notion as it does anything else.The Coens' irreverent, silly but whip-smart humor also pervades ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" The dynamic of the loquacious and self- absorbed Everett along with hotheaded Pete and the clueless optimist Delmar has endless appeal, even when it's clear early on that it's not a healthy one. The oddball characters along the way, especially George ""Don't Call Him Babyface"" Nelson (Michael Badalucco), John Goodman's Big Dan Teague and rival politicians Pappy O'Daniel (Charles Durning) and Homer Stokes (Wayne Duvall) provide a similarly intriguging effect to the many creatures Odysseus and crew meet in their travels.""O Brother"" stands testament to the power of American folklore, that even for a country barely 200 years old, there's a certain magic in it that the Coen brothers tap into with the appropriate use of magical realism and narrative technique that resembles Greek mythology. Its concept and music may be more exciting than its plot, but ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" is a special film to behold of a genre all its own.~Steven CThanks for reading!

50,Vartiainen,Dapper Dan Dares You to Disapprove!,7,27 March 2020,"Yes sirree, I did see this here picture show, featuring the gentlemen three George Clooney, John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson. A fine picture. More than fine. Directed by the esteemed Coen Brother. Ethan and Joel. Such fine boys. Very respectable in their fields and purveyors of quality entertainment, of which I've partaken more than once. If I dare reveal such tantalizing little nugget of personal information to your kind self.And I do belief that you don't need to hear any more. But nevertheless, because I'm a throughout man, who believes in not leaving a job unfinished if I can at all help it, I shall go into more detail. Yes sir, I did say more detail and I meant it, so help me God.Misters Clooney, Turturro and Nelson play here three gentleman of ill repute. Veritable scoundrels they are and fresh off the hook of the great state of Mississippi. So to speak. For you see, and I know you'll find this hard to believe, but this here picture show features escaped convicts as its main characters. Now, I know that there are those among your humble and pious ranks whose first reaction is to find this offensive. And to you I say, bless you, kind madams and sirs. Bless you. You are the salt of the Earth and yours is the kingdom of Heaven. And yet to you I also say, open your hearts. For these are the most likable dirty chainbreakers you're ever likely to witness on this good Earth.I might go on to praise the acting of these gentlemen three. Especially that of Mister Clooney, slipping into the guise of Ulysses Everett McGill, a man of words if there ever was one. Why, this man could charm the feathers of a singing bird. He could talk to rain and make it dry. He would don you his hat, flash a smile and become your most trusted friend before dinner.Alas, if we are to talk about this picture show, and talk about it we must, it behooves us to also talk about the mistakes that have slipped in. For you see, and I must ask those weak of heart in the audience to praise themselves, this here picture ain't perfect. I'd dare even say it's flawed.Now, I hear you crying. Mister, what could possibly be wrong with this picture. It's directed by the Brothers Coen. It has Mister George Clooney in it. Its story is based on Homer's The Odyssey. It even has the honour of being the first feature film ever to be fully digitally colour corrected. What possible fault can be found in it?And to you, good sir, I say that the fault lies in its attempt to be a Grecian epic. It's precisely its attempt to imitate art greater than itself which reveals its flaws. Certainly, there are scenes within it that are lifted from the pages of Homer. But they're pale imitations and unwieldy in the setting of Deep South during the decade of 1930. I dare say, they don't fit. They're out of place. They're misaligned, out of whack, purposeless. They are an ill fit.Nevertheless and despite my misgivings about certain aspects of storytelling as they pertain to the general cohesiveness of the cinematic grandiose this picture represents, I did enjoy watching this film. It was a lark, a gay old time. Why, I even find myself recommending it to my friends. Can you imagine?","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
51,billcr12,Clooney and Coen's,8,19 March 2012,Brother where art thou is taken from Preston Sturges World War 2 era comedy Sullivan's Travels in which a movie director sets out to chronicle the misery of the depression. Instead he decides that people in the country need to have something to laugh at. The Coen brothers use Sturges' style in a prison escape comedy with George Clooney leading the way. Ulysses(Clooney) has been informed by a cell mate that he has buried over one million dollars and that it will be underwater due to a project creating a man made lake in four days time. The escaping convicts meet hobos on the railways and encounter a Christian revival and are baptized along the way. Further adventures include a run in with th ku klux klan and a man with a radio station recording Christian music. The accompanying soundtrack is awesome and the Coen brother have made a lasting tribute to Preston Sturges.,"O Brother, Where Art Thou"
52,thinker1691,""" It's a Fool who Looks for Logic in the Human Heart """,7,29 March 2013,"The Film is called "" O Brother, Where are Thou ? "" is directed by Joel Coen and having been written by his brother Ethan Coen. The story is a Hy-bred cross between a Depression era saga and Homor's ancient epic 'The Odyssey.' Three convicts escape a Chain gang and set off on a journey of discovery during the 1930s'. Though a bit confusing, the Characters more than explain their philosophies and their thoughts on life, each concluding that their suffering and predicaments are part of the natural order of things. Indeed, the stars of the movie more than anything else, give life to the escaping prisoners. George Clooney plays Everett McGill, an educated con-man with family troubles. John Turturro is Pete Hogwallop and Tim Blake Nelson are his two inmate followers who share his trek across the countryside. John Goodman, Michael Badalucco (As Baby-face Nelson) and Charles Durning join the cast and are credited with the spark of Good Ole southern Boys found throughout the story. Escaping from their captivity, the boys search for a buried treasure and are warned by a blind man that what they'll find is not what they hope for. In the meanwhile during the country election they find that their musical talents promise more than they know. What is a complete surprise in this film is the singing talent of George Clooney. Sophisticate in many other movies, in this one he delights audiences with his true down-home demeanor. All in all a real home-spun movie which will delight audiences everywhere. Well Done. ****","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
53,drqshadow-reviews,This Depression-Era Tall Tale Never Gets Old,10,16 January 2012,"Maybe the perfect adventure film, this instant Coen classic is impossible to turn away from. Though it makes no mistake about its influences - an early title card immediately identifies the picture as an adaptation of Homer's Odyssey - the brilliance of O Brother is in its departures from the source material, which come so frequently that the carryovers (the Sirens, the Cyclops, the protagonist's escape from captivity) are celebrated as nods and winks, expected but also unexpected. George Clooney, John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson are perfectly cast as the charismatically brainless scoundrels at the story's epicenter, while guest spots from John Goodman, Holly Hunter and Charles Durning take the whole mess over the top. Amazingly rich, sharp-witted, engrossing stuff that's accompanied by an all-time favorite of a soundtrack.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"

George Clooney is at his best and combines comedy, drama, romance and singing in his performance.

55,MaxBorg89,Another Coen ride!,10,24 August 2008,"Despite the ""based on Homer's The Odyssey"" credit at the beginning of the film, Ethan and Joel Coen claim to have never read the book. It's hard to believe otherwise, because aside from explicit plot references to the great Greek poet O Brother, Where Art Thou is a pure piece of Coen extravaganza: iconic characters, silly names, absurd situations and dialogue worth remembering.The brothers' fourth ""comedy"" (after Raising Arizona, Barton Fink and The Hudsucker Proxy) tells the story of three convicts (George Clooney, John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson) who manage to break out of jail and set out to find a buried treasure (1.2 million dollars) somewhere in a Depression-stricken Mississippi. Everett Ulysses McGill (Clooney), a man who knows how to talk his way out of trouble, is also determined to win back the love of his wife Penny (Holly Hunter). During their colorful journey they run into a trumpet player who says he has sold his soul to the Devil and form a country music band to avoid regular people's suspicions, something that ought to come in handy when law enforcers, an evil salesman (John Goodman) and even the Ku Klux Klan are looking for them.O Brother, Where Art Thou? is a light affair, but that doesn't make it less satisfying than other Coen brothers pictures: alongside their usual care for dialogue and performance (Clooney and Turturro are the standouts), plenty of plaudits should go to their reconstruction of the historical period the movie takes place in, particularly through Roger Deakins' Oscar-nominated cinematography. In addition, given the story, the soundtrack is another source of joy, especially when the Soggy Bottom Boys (that would the stage name used by the main characters) perform in front of an audience. It's a hilarious film filled with vitality and happiness, and a strangely optimistic piece of work coming from the Coens.In short, this is another artistic triumph for cinema's most talented brothers, definitely worth watching, even if you haven't read the (alleged) source material.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
56,Lechuguilla,Journey Through A Bad Dream,7,14 February 2016,"Three not-so-smart convicts escape a chain gang in Depression-era Mississippi and in three stooges fashion, go from one disaster to another. The semi-humorous plot is like a bad dream that goes on and on, each segment brief and with little or no continuity to the segment that went before. Along the way our stooges encounter interesting, oddball characters, most of whom represent some stereotyped persona from that era in American history. Probably the most interesting of these characters is ""Radio Station Man"", a blind one man outfit that records and plays corny songs to a local hick audience.Given the surreal storyline, lack of scene continuity is not a problem. But some segments and some characters seem like unnecessary filler. Character exaggeration works well for some characters, but not others. Toward the end the plot gets a little silly and the climax seems tacked on.Except for the wide ratio, letterbox screen format, color cinematography is terrific. The brownish yellow sepia toned images, which exist throughout, convey an appropriately dry and old look, consistent with the story's bygone era. Overall mise-en-scene design adds emotional support to that visual feel.I could have wished for less screen time for George Clooney, whose character dominates the plot. Aside from that, casting and acting are acceptable. Possibly the best element is that harmonic music, a down home type that generally has gone out of style, though it remains popular among mostly rural Americans.A splashy, big budget, in-your-face satire of some elements in American history, ""O Brother ..."" holds your attention as we journey dream-like through a world of three guys whose collective IQ may be limited but whose capacity to find trouble is not.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
57,jimbo-53-186511,A complete failure on all counts,1,23 September 2014,"This is another example of a film that once again fails to live up to its relatively good premise; IMDb Plot Summary ""Three escaped convicts search for hidden treasure while a relentless lawmen pursues them"". That is all I was looking for - a nice little cat and mouse chase with laughter and fun thrown in throughout the film - sadly you get none of that here.I'm aware that this film has been adapted from Homer's Odyssey, but I'm not going to claim I know much about this work. I am aware that some of the characters and scenarios depicted in this film are based on this Odyssey, but does that make it a good film? God no!!!! The problem with this film is that many characters are introduced and then disappear seemingly without any point or purpose. Let's look at a few examples;GEORGE NELSON - a mobster whose character is presumably meant to be some kind of parody of Baby Face Nelson whose real name is also George Nelson. His character arrives and the only memorable scene involving his character and our trio of fugitives was a rather disgusting scene which involved him shooting cattle and then their pursuers running a couple of cattle over. Is this meant to be funny? It was pretty sick if you ask me. His character is then randomly introduced at the end when he's arrested and sentenced to death - again possibly a parable of the life of the real life character. TOMMY JOHNSON - a hitchhiker that our trio pick up who has sold his soul to the devil. He then quickly disappears and then reappears later in the film when he's captured by the KKK who wish to sacrifice him because he sold his soul to the devil??? I honestly couldn't believe how stupid it all was.DAN TEAGUE - a religious fanatic whose character served no real purpose in the film other than to shock the audience. I like John Goodman, but his presence in this film wasn't enough to save this catastrophe of a film.Added to a whole host of pointless characters the Coens also present you with a screenplay that's a complete mess - they'd go from one scene to the next without any sort of logical connection. As I've mentioned characters are introduced and then disappear without any real explanation and then are reintroduced in the most ridiculous and contrived of ways. Factor all of this with a stupid sub plot involving two government officials both fighting to win people's vote. What the hell did that have to do with anything? Also, I thought this was meant to be a film where the fugitives are being pursued. Did anyone really get the feeling that they were actually being chased? I think I only saw the law enforcement official about 3 times during the entire 105 minute running time.I would have forgiven most of the above if the film had even been remotely funny, but it couldn't even fulfil that basic need. We have the running joke of RUNOFT. Is that supposed to be a joke about how people speak in the Deep South or is the joke that they are thick and are unable to spell? That was lost on me. Then there's the scene at the start where our trio of fugitives randomly enter an establishment and start singing into a pan. What the hell was that all about? I kept scratching my head and wondering if I just didn't 'get' it.The main failings of this film are simply that there's too much going on; too many characters who serve no purpose, too many sub plots, it wasn't remotely funny, poor chemistry between the 3 leads. I think the Coens may possibly have been trying to weave stories together, but it doesn't work because there's just too much going on and too much for the average viewer to take in. The only positive I took from this was the initial scene with the blind man on the rail road where he says 'There's a fortune out there, but there's a long road ahead of you to reach that fortune'. It's clever because it makes the audience believe one thing, but by the end it's interpreted as something else. That is the only positive that I got from this film.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
58,noralee,Listen to the Soundtrack and Skip the Movie,5,19 December 2005,"""O Brother Where Art Thou?"" features some of the best and worst tendencies of the Coen Brothers as they reexamine another movie genre. The cinematography is lush -- where ""Fargo"" was visually about white, ""Miller's Crossing"" visually about dark and ""Barton Fink"" fascinated by the look of fire, ""O Brother"" lingers over golden and amber waves of grain. ""In Fargo,"" I thought the Coens had genuine love for their home turf underneath the satire and cruelty, but here we have a South of yokel myth, that makes Preston Sturges' magical ""Sullivan's Travels"" --which this is close to a remake of--seem like a documentary. The Daughters of the Confederacy who walked out of ""Gone With The Wind"" for showing that the South lost the War Between the States would surely walk out of this one.Like a humorous counterpoint to ""Dancer in the Dark,"" this feels like a European musical's look at the South of the Great Depression, from corrupt politicians, to chain gangs, to river baptisms, to KKK rallies, road kill BBQs, and bank robberies. But it comes alive through the overpowering music selected by T-Bone Burnett that becomes the central focus of the movie (complete with a pilgrimage to a radio station as in ""American Graffiti"" but with a commercial and political exploitation angle: ""Hey a man there will pay you for singing into a can!""). Few other than public radio listeners will feel disconcerted having the very distinctive voices of Allison Krauss, Emmy Lou Harris, Gillian Welch, the Fairfield 4, and Ralph Stanley come out of actors' mouths, like in ""Pennies from Heaven,"" because the music is the basis for mesmerizing, highly theatrical set-pieces. It must have been at the directors' direction that John Torturro gives the worst performance of his otherwise exemplary career and Tim Blake Nelsonis worse, as their faces are frozen in Ma and Pa Kettle stereotypes. George Clooney tries a Southern accent for 30 seconds then gives up, which is ironic as he was born and raised in Kentucky. His container of Dapper Dan hair pomade becomes an ongoing leitmotif like the hat in ""Miller's Crossing"" with no significance other than the visual. I did miss the opening minute or so due to strong hunger pains and a slow refreshment line, but I don't think seeing the opening quote from Homer would have changed my impression. I recommend the soundtrack rather than the video.(originally written 12/30/2000)","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
59,NateWatchesCoolMovies,A bona fide Classic and a sensory experience all its own,10,21 November 2015,"The Coen Brother's O Brother Where Art Thou is just a rush of pure originality, musical genius and inspired storytelling, situated outside the box of used conventions, and rooted deeply in a whimsical realm of absurd, charming characters on an epic odyssey across the American south during arguably the most eccentric time period, the 1930s Great Depression. It's the Coen's second best for me (it's hard to top the Lebowski, dude), and a film that I watched so many time growing up that it's almost now a piece of my soul. It's loosely based on Homer's The Odyssey. Three bumbling convicts escape from a dusty chain gang in a delightful opening romp set to Harry McClintock's The Big Rock Candy Mountain. Ulysses Everett McGill (George Clooney) is their silver tongued, trouble making leader, on his way to reunite with his estranged wife (Holly Hunter, reliably stubborn and sassy) and little daughters. Along with him is short tempered Pete (Coen regular John Turturro in top form) and sweet, dimwitted Delmar (Tim Blake Nelson). Together they get in just about every kind of trouble that you can imagine three hapless convicts on the run in depression era south getting into. They briefly share paths with musician Tommy (Chris Thomas King), cross the radar of a boisterous bible salesman (John Goodman, stealing scenes as usual with his effortless, booming charm), become involved with duelling governor candidates Homer Stokes and Pappy O Daniels (Wayne Duvall and Charles Durning), and have run ins with sexy sirens led by Musetta Vander, the KKK, notorious mobster George Babyface Nelson (Michael Badalucco has to be seen to be believed as the lively, likely bi polar suffering wise guy) and more, all the while pursued by mysterious Sheriff Cooley (Daniel Von Bargen, RIP). It's quite al lot of goings on for one film, but the Coens are masters of telling zany, eclectic stories that deviate into all sorts of unexpected subplots without ever derailing and losing us. This one flows along wondrously, a wild, funny and haunting fable that almost feels like a dust bowl Dante's Inferno at times, albeit of much lighter subject matter. Roger Deakins spins poetry with his lens, capturing every chaff of wheat, every ray of southern sun and brown hued set design with painstaking expertise. What really holds it together though, is the absolute knockout soundtrack. There's so many moments of now iconic musical storytelling that we feel we're watching a strange bluegrass lullaby that just happens to take place in cinematic vision. The Coens have always known their music, but they transcend to another level of intuition here, gathering an incredibly evocative group of songs and artists together that stir the collective ancestral memory of historical Americana. Off the top of my head there's You Are My Sunshine, Keep On The Sunny Side, I'll Fly Away beautifully warbled by the Kossoy Sisters, Didn't Leave Nobody But The Babe sung by the slinky sirens, In The Highways by the adorable Peasall sisters, Jimmie Rodgers's In The Jailhouse Now, Lonesome Valley, Ralph Stanley's two eerie pieces O Death, and Angel Band, also by the Peasall Gals, and the classic Down To The River To Pray, which sneaks up on you and leaves you in rapture from its inescapable grip. My favourite by far though is I Am A Man Of Constant Sorrow, an endlessly catchy hobo tune of jangling melancholy and highway humour, sung by John Hartford but cheekily lip synced by Clooney and team, an original piece made up on the fly by the three characters that goes on to make them ridiculously famous under the pseudonym the 'Soggy Bottom Boys'. It's all an intoxicating wonder to take in, the period authentic screenplay and production a feast for the senses. The Coens seem to be adept at whatever they try; sly satire, period piece, stinging violence, dark humour, and even touching drama when they put their minds to it. This is a career high for them, a totally unique piece of art that demands multiple viewings and a spot in any avid movie collectors pantheon.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
60,davispittman,I really don't get why audiences enjoyed this....,1,20 March 2017,"Oh brother where art thou is a very strange film. I wonder if I'm just not the right kind of person to watch and enjoy this, I know lots of viewers like this movie, but I absolutely hate it. I think George Clooney is a very talented actor and I usually like him both on the big screen and in real life, but he just really annoyed me here. His acting seems way too over the top funny and it's all just too obvious. What I mean by that is that I don't really like it when actors deliver comedic lines so obviously that it's not funny, I prefer more dry/witty type humor. But it's not just the way the actors say the lines, it's also the writing, it's too over the top and obvious. When comedic dialogue is written in that way, in my opinion, they lose their appeal and amusement factor. It drains the funny reaction out that the audience is supposed to experience. And the issue is that it's not like this movie drops lines like that, it's all the time, I could forgive a few moments like that, but not all throughout the whole thing.... So really since the comedy didn't work for me and actors that I normally like were held captive to this bad writing, the whole thing just doesn't work. Also I really hate bluegrass music so whenever that would occur it would just make it that much worse. 1/10.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
61,Kdosda_Hegen,Interesting movie which doesn't lead anythere.,7,29 May 2020,"This film is full of great music and interesting situations, but the story leads nowhere. I was waiting for a big finnale, but the movie just ended, before going somewhere.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
62,slokes,Opryland Odyssey,8,15 May 2006,"Mississippi Gov. Pappy O'Daniel is consulting with his campaign staff about a tough election opponent:""He's pulling' our pants down."" ""Gonna paddle a little behind.""""Ain't gonna paddle it - gonna kick it, real hard.""""No, I believe he's gonna paddle it.""""I don't believe that's a proper characterization.""Such a discussion can mean only two things: Either we are witnessing one of the most inept campaigns in the history of democracy, or we are watching another marvelously quotable Coen Brothers comedy.""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" is something more than that, though, a fun story that resonates with the spirit of the bygone American South and cadges elements of Homer's ""Odyssey"" to create a sturdy central story featuring three runaway jailbirds who encounter a number of detours (including O'Daniel's re-election campaign) while seeking treasure.George Clooney shines as the leader of the three, the loquacious, philosophic Ulysses Everett McGill (""It's a fool that looks for logic in the chambers of the human heart,"" he says when pressed to explain why he stole a watch.) Clooney rises to the challenge of playing a period character with nice touches of slapstick enhancing his characteristically slick delivery.Clooney is ably aided and abetted by John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson, who play hayseeds ""dumber than a bag of hammers"" who accompany Ulysses on his quest. Turturro, who made his name playing more modern urban characters, does particularly well as the most ornery member of the group.The characters may not be that deep, but then they never are in Coen Brothers' films. They exist only to serve the film, and in this case, they serve quite well. The Coens are not taking things too seriously this time around, as if incorporating the highbrow structure of re-doing Homer freed them to concentrate on entertainment and audience immersion instead of arty flourishes.You really feel like you are back in 1937, with the attention to detail in look and sound. When Ulysses curses about his favorite hair pomade not being available in a general store, the proprietor admonishes him this is ""a public place"" and he won't stand for such talk. The ""old-timey"" musical score put the film on the map, and you get a rich gumbo of bluegrass and Jimmie Rodgers-era country music, with some blues and gospel thrown in. It's such a throwback, it comes across as exotic. Then again, you could say the same of the whole film.Some of the bits work better than others. John Goodman, great in the otherwise erratic Coen Brothers film ""The Big Lebowski,"" is a weak link as the film's version of Homer's menacing Cyclops, and Holly Hunter is a bit one-note as Ulysses' adamantine wife.But any weaknesses are easy to overlook when you get such wonderful bits as the campaign of Gov. O'Daniel (Charles Durning, never better), a bank-heist spree with George ""don't call him Babyface"" Nelson and Stephen Root's deliciously goofy turn as a bug-eyed music promoter who re-directs Ulysses' fortunes. The music is very cleverly integrated throughout the film; even the Ku Klux Klan gets to perform a pretty cool number.Watching ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" you'll wonder where the time went, and want to see it again for all the clever bits of Coen business you missed the first time. And if that last image of the film isn't forever burned in some corner of your mind, there is something serious wrong with your soul.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
63,TOMNEL,"Usually very entertaining, It certainly looks great.",8,3 February 2008,"From the opening of the film, almost to the end, this movie has a great feel. The cinematography is beautiful, and following around these three escaped convicts is interesting to watch. But, unfortunately, these characters are only so interesting, and the situations are what the movie has to rely on. The situations become tiring, and then the characters have to run the show. It would've been good if both were great at all times, but they just weren't.Everett (George Clooney), Delmar (Tim Blake Nelson) and Pete (John Turturro) have just escaped from prison. They go on several long adventures, sing a few songs, and more than anything, try to avoid the police. All 3 of the leading actors are very good, and have an odd (but great) chemistry with each other. Tim Blake Nelson, especially, stands out acting wise as the confused convict who wants to be erased of all his sins. The movie has no real plot or center, which is fine, but some of the sub-plots are dull, and bring this movie down a level from where it could be. Overall though, this is a beautiful looking, interesting character piece on three good hearted convicts.My rating: *** out of ****. 100 mins. PG-13 for violence and language.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
64,Steffi_P,"""An old-timey harmony thing""",10,26 March 2012,"America is a young country, but it is not without a rich mythology. We may not think of it in this way, but the modern era has its folk tales, and they are defined in literature, theatre and of course cinema. In recent years some of the best American folk tales have been woven by that eminent fraternal writer-director team, the brothers Coen. O Brother Where Art Thou? was among their most profound yet playful.In writing this picture the brothers weave together numerous cultural motifs, many of them from the movies. The title itself is that of the fictional movie in Sullivan's Travels. We see depression-era legends such as the good-natured bank robber and the blues guitarist selling his soul alongside cinematic references as disparate as The Wizard of Oz and Doctor Strangelove. All this is loosely structured around Homer's Odyssey, drawing together the strands of this modern mythology with that of the ancient world.And as a directorial team, the Coens have a mark of simplicity and gentleness which allows the best elements of the movie to shine through. The pacing of each scene is considered and languid. This doesn't make things boring; it allows us to savour each glorious country scene or earthy expression. There is so much packed into each moment, showing us a rich world beyond the storyline. The Coens bring out period details, not through the wider shots but through seemingly inconsequential bits of background business, like the copy of Ward's catalogue that props up Hogwallop's boy on his seat.The resultant movie is both witty and meaningful, but also beautiful and human. The brothers Coen show us a people whose peculiarities are just as beautiful or as harsh as the landscapes around them. Filled with deliberate anachronism (""You Are My Sunshine"" for example was not written until some years after it's set) and broad stretches of logic, O Brother Where Art Thou is not so much a historical movie as a mystical yet familiar dream of America's past.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
65,ShootingShark,Musical Mississippi Odyssey Comedy,7,24 July 2005,"Three cons in depression-era Mississippi escape from a work farm and embark on a strange series of misadventures in which they are chased by the police, record a hit record, hook up with a bank robber, are waylaid by three sirens, get ambushed by a bible salesman, rescue a man from the Klu Klux Klan, get pardoned by the State Governor, and are saved from certain death by a divine flood.Joel and Ethan Coen's strange but wonderful variation on Homer's Odyssey is delightful, filled with typically crackling dialogue (""Friend, some of your folding money has come unstole !!"") and awash in great period music - blues, gospel, hillbilly yodelling, zydeco, what have you, supervised by T-Bone Burnett. Clooney, Turturro and particularly Nelson make for a fine latter-day version of the Three Stooges, with plenty of good-natured face-pulling and double-taking. The large cast all make the most of their tongue-twisting lines and good IL' boy wardrobes - I especially like Von Bargen as the Archetypal Coen Demon-Fiend, complete with hell-hound and sunglasses at night. The title of the movie comes from the film Joel McCrea wants to make (but never does) in Preston Sturges' brilliant Sullivan's Travels, and some of the characters are based on real people (King is legendary Delta bluesman Robert Johnson, for example). The links with Homer's epic poem are a bit tenuous to say the least - a guy estranged from his wife seeking to win her back, some sirens, a Cyclops (sort of) - and the script sometimes feels like it's a collection of funny episodes strung together rather than a coherent story, but it's so much fun that it doesn't really matter. Director of photography Roger Deakins captures a fabulous sepia-toned look to the rural scenes and there are plenty of wonderful visual touches - my favourite being the moment the flood comes and as everything is submerged a school of Clooney's Dapper Dan haircream tins perform an impromptu little aqua-ballet before our eyes. This is a wonderfully unique toe-tapping comedy.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
66,truemythmedia,My Favorite Coen Brothers Film,10,11 September 2019,"As I write I find myself wondering why this one gets me laughing so hard and I think it's for a lot of reasons. The first is that there is something hilarious to me about adapting a story like ""The Iliad,"" a Classic (in the Greek foundational principles sense of the word) High Myth Hero's Journey, and setting it in the deep south during the great depression. There couldn't be anything less grand than that.The other thing I find so funny are the characters. Between the three of them, Everett (George Clooney, ""Burn After Reading"") Pete (John Turturro, ""Barton Fink"") and Delmar (Tim Blake Nelson, ""The Ballad of Buster Scruggs"") are each one of them hilarious on their own but the interplay between them is priceless.Everett is the fast talking knowledgeable man of the world, always scheming and angling for what will give him an edge. He may be knowledgeable but he's not always right or even trying to be right. He's just trying to get his own way and facts, exaggerations, stories, and quickly spoken half truths are his way of doing it.Pete is easily out matched by Everett because while he may have a better sense of what is just and looks out for what is fair and right, he is also dumb. As such, Everett almost always gets away with whatever he wants and Pete is left continually frustrated in his attempts to make sure he isn't getting the short straw.Delmar is dumb as well but sweet. He wants everyone to just get along and is always looking to be helpful. Of course, as Everett, Pete and pretty much any other person they run into is always looking to pull one over on each other, this puts him in the awkward position of never really knowing whose side to be on, since he's on everyone's side.This trio of silliness leads to some of the funniest back and forth conversations, shouting matches, and name calling I've ever seen on screen.The last thing that makes this movie really funny to me, and I know this is controversial, is the southern drawl of every character in this film. My Grandmother was originally from Arkansas and while her accent has much diminished over the 35 years I've known her, it was very strong to me when I was younger. I always thought it was funny that she referred to Meijer (a local grocery chain) as 'Maars."" For me, a southern accent is both funny and fond when I hear it so I know some people may not get the same feeling from this film as I do but for me it is a perfect combination to go with the themes of the movie.The themes in this film are certainly Coen Brother classics. The values of brotherhood, family, sacrifice, and hard work, with edges of fate, the supernatural, or karmic justice are ever present in their films but the way they blend it with that southern gospel and dry dust working man mentality cuts through strong in this film. It isn't lost on me that the three leads in this film form a close bond, the film is called ""O BROTHER, Where Art Thou,"" and it was directed by the Coen BROTHERS. As a brother myself I can attest to the spirit of camaraderie that can form between siblings and this film oozes with it. There is nothing like the bond that can form between people when they journey together and seem to meld into one person in three bodies almost.The last thing I will extol in this film is the music. I leave it for last because it is the best. Old time twang and southern gospel in its many forms. Upbeat and praise filled, down low and mournful, and wistful longing for a home that is not yet ours. It is used for good and evil alike and the solace of those broken by life and their fellow human beings as well as the joy in the hearts of children still ignorant of life's troubles. There are many songs in this film that feels as if you might have been able to hear them on any summer evening as you drove by the porches of families all gathered outside to enjoy the cool breeze accompanying the setting sun.Perhaps that is what I, actually, love the most about this film. The sense of coming home after hard times away. The belief that, while family is worth everything, close friends are often the crucible through which we are refined and make us better people for our families when we do get home and join them. The journey is not the destination, but it does change us and make us into the people who will arrive there.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
67,Spleen,Gold,10,30 August 2001,"At least the Coen brothers know how to use modern technology, if nobody else does.  That wonderful sun-drenched look is the result of an effects house digitally manipulating the original photographs to desaturate the greens - but at least there WERE original photographs.  Computer MANIPULATION of images need not be a great crime.  The manipulation here is at heart optical; they could, in principle, have used a film with an unusual colour response.  -It's computer-GENERATED images that are particularly evil, and the Coen brothers, bless them, have no truck with such things.  That wooden house we see at the end, for instance, is a model.  Maybe a few directors will notice how good that sequence looks; maybe it will even persuade them to stop reaching for the computer animators at the first sign of difficulty, like a hypochondriac reaching for the antibiotics.""O Brother, Where Art Thou"" is the Coens' best work since ""Barton Fink"", a constantly entertaining, visually beguiling, musically delicious film that I had great difficulty understanding.  Others had to explain it to me, and I still don't get everything.  I don't get the title, for instance.  It comes from ""Sullivan's Travels"", and while I haven't seen that film, I know the story: film director Sullivan is tired of churning out shallow entertainment, and sets out to make a socially aware piece of moralism that will expose the plight of the poor; he plans to call it ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"".  -I get the reference, but I don't get the joke.  Would Sullivan's film really have looked anything like THIS?Of course not.  The Coens have succeeded in doing what others have merely attempted - they've turned a twentieth-century era into a mythical, prehistoric golden age.  They make it seem effortless, too, as though all they had to do to make the enchantment lying over the landscape visible was place a filter over their lens and turn it ninety degrees.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
68,onepotato2,Hee-Haw for film snobs,1,24 July 2010,"It's possible to make a smart movie about yokels. It's much more common to make a movie about Yokels that traffics in stupid yokel humor. Sadly, this is the latter. The Coen brothers have a very sophisticated understanding of American regionalism; which they blend with their unrefined, idiotic sense of humor to make some very awful movies. There comes a point in this movie when a viewer cuts his losses, as the scales tip from enthralling regionalism, to repellent juvenile low-humor; which probably wasn't even funny when it last appeared (vaudeville?). There isn't a gag in the Coen canon that rises above cornball. How they've managed to parlay this into a respectable career is confounding. Only the blue-grass and gospel songs save this turkey from being totally dead in the water. At the 30 minute mark, all the energy has wheezed out of it, forward momentum has completely expired, and you're left with over an hour with no perceptible value whatever.O bother...","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
69,Seraphion,Not quite the Odyssey I know but it's nice,7,17 October 2015,"While stated at the very beginning that this movie is based on Homer's Odyssey, I feel that the Coen Brothers really take their freedom and gives a loose interpretation of the extant. The story feels like it's not a complete version of the Odyssey, rather a collection of snippets of the more significant incidents. The characters and backgrounds are also getting reinterpreted, wildly must I say. Yet those interpretations get to be very funny and entertaining. I really enjoy the interpretation about the Cyclops and the sirens. The mood gets to be formed very nicely with the coherent choices of lighting and coloration. The acting in overall looks also good. George Clooney takes most of the credit for it, but John Turturro did also quite good, especially on their face expressions.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"

It is full of wit, fun, and beauty-this is seriously one of the most well made films of the 2000's. I would highly recommend watching this on a large screen, because some scenes are so wild and epic that it is essential to view them with the best sound and audio quality possible on the biggest screen possible! I really wish I could have made it to the theater to watch this film when it was originally released, what a fun time that would have been!

73,lewiskendell,Fun to watch!,7,1 February 2016,"The first thing that struck me about O Brother, Where Art Thou? was the locations. The Coen brothers did a stellar job of portraying the Mississippi of this time period as I have always imagined it would look. It makes me want to seek out these parts of my state myself, just to see what true rural Mississippi once looked like.The second thing that caught my attention about this movie is how over-the-top it is. That will automatically make it unpleasant for some, but it became endearing for me after only a short time. Yes, George Clooney's accent doesn't work nearly as well as John Turturro's or Tim Blake Nelson's, but after a while it all seems to fit and just seems right.The third element that stands out about O Brother is the songs. Awesome. Every scene is highlighted by some of the most kick-ass, old-timey tunes known to man. Anyone who doesn't want the soundtrack after seeing the movie is just being contrary. The fact that this is loosely based on The Odyssey is only occasionally apparent, but the story that is here is more than enough to entertain. Every new character is captivating, no matter how long or brief their screen time. The movies starts off brilliantly, sags a bit toward the middle, and then finishes fairly strong. It's not quite consistent enough to be a classic, but I definitely would like to see it again. O Brother, Where Art Thou? is just a lot of fun to watch.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
74,philip_vanderveken,The Coen Brothers did it again,9,21 July 2005,"I'm pretty sure that when you tell people that this movie is a comedy that has been based on Homer's Odyssey, you'll get two reactions, but never a good one. Either they don't believe you, thinking that such a classic story can never become a good comedy, either they will not give the movie a try, because they are convinced that this will be much too difficult for them to understand or because they aren't familiar with the Greek writer and his work. No, tell everybody that this is a comedy from the Coen brothers and you'll be sure that you have an interested audience...This movie tells the story behind the adventures of three escaped convicts. It's 1937 and the economic crisis weighs heavy on everyone. But the three man aren't exactly worrying about their financial status. They escaped from the jail chain-gang with the intention to pick up the the loot of a bank heist that Everett had stashed away near his home. But their way is long and difficult. They meet all kinds of strange characters (sirens, a bank robber, a campaigning Governor and his opponent, a KKK lynch mob, a blind prophet...), but don't have much time to really think about all that happens to them, because the house will soon be flooded by a newly built dam...After watching this movie, I just needed a little break before I could go on with something else. The reason for that is quite simple: I had been laughing so hard that it almost started to hurt. This is an incredibly funny movie with some excellent humor in it. With this movie, the Coen Brothers really made an excellent adaptation of the ancient Odyssey, although ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" isn't exactly a title that reminded me of an old Greek writer. Before having all the correct information, I even believed that this movie had something to do with Shakespeare or someone from that time period.It isn't a very strict 'translation' of the Odyssey of course, but it isn't too hard to find some similarities either (like for instance the sirens). But what would a movie be with a very good story when the acting isn't excellent? Indeed, nothing at all. But don't worry, George Clooney, John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson are absolutely brilliant. Their performances are amazing and I was especially surprised by Tim Blake Nelson. I can't remember that I've ever seen him play in another movie, but what he did here, only promises the best for the future.All in all this is a wonderful comedy that will not only be loved by the people who are familiar with Homer's Odyssey. This movie has been based on it, but only loosely, leaving enough room for a new interpretation and some excellent humor. Add to this some very fine acting and you know that you have another hit from the Coen Brothers. I loved this movie and I can't remember that I've ever seen any comedy better than this one. That's also the reason why I believe that this movie doesn't deserve anything less than an 8.5/10.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"

77,jacobs-greenwood,"Second viewing no better than the first, crude and lacking appeal",3,12 October 2016,"First saw this Coen Brothers movie around the time it came out, or shortly after it was released for rental ... I can't remember. Wrote it off as a disappointing film, one of several from the brothers whose work is inconsistent: sometimes great, but all too frequently fair or nothing special.However, some friends kept mentioning it, quoting lines from it, cracking each other up saying that - like Monty Python's Holy Grail - it grows on you. So I gave it another chance.Oh well.The second time around I found it worse than disappointing; I found it offensive. The movie should be rated R for the number of times it takes the Lord's name in vain. I almost turned it off but, as I'm apt to do no matter how bad a movie is, I stuck it out until the bitter end, which means I had to suffer through the blasphemous KKK scene.O Brother Where Art Thou doesn't work as a comedy (I know I didn't laugh, and am not even sure I smiled) or as a drama. It lacks a sympathetic character (Tim Blake Nelson comes the closest, and it's hard not to like Holly Hunter in anything) or even any memorable scenes.Yes, there are the typical Coen Brothers' eccentric characters and references to classic stories (Homer) and movies (like Cool Hand Luke) but, instead of enhancing this film or honoring the past, they just don't work. I suppose - as my friends mentioned - there are some repeatable lines (smugly delivered by George Clooney's character, no surprise there), but why would one want to be reminded of this forgetful film?","O Brother, Where Art Thou"

The adventurers this time are escaped convicts, wandering about the Depression afflicted South bungling their way into trouble.The greatest strength of the film is the wonderful music soundtrack, effectively evoking not only the era that this is set in, but the spiritual references that run rampant in the film. Besides its value to the tone of the movie, the music is just plain fun to listen to.What cripples the film is that the characters really aren't that likable. In a comedy, you need that element in order to have fun along with them in their misadventures. Instead, we have a bunch of selfish, arrogant, soulless, mean spirited nobodies who really have no positive points at all. They're not imposing enough to make you hate them either, so it's hard to relate to them at all. They're offered up as clowns, but like people who put clown makeup on and march in parades, they just aren't funny.Like the story that inspired it, the movie takes these guys on an ""odyssey,"" encountering a variety of symbolic (some even mystical) characters. Everybody is stamped with offensive stereotypes, the operative word being ""stupid."" People are mocked right and left, and consequently, no one is left being particularly interesting or appealing. The movie doesn't like its own characters, and it doesn't let you like them, either.Riverside baptisms, beautiful sirens, stolen cars, fistfights, radio preachers, people being whipped with sticks; all are thrown at you in disjointed fashion. Some evoke a few laughs, others confuse or bore you. I did laugh when a nerdy guy beat the snot out of an especially obnoxious lead character. But there were a lot more pointlessly gratuitous scenes; an example: some '30's Dillinger-type guy strafes cows with a tommy-gun. Comedy? Symbolism? No; just mindless violence, which detracts from the intellectual nature of the original source material this story draws upon.Other adaptations of the Odyssey are much better. Unless you're a George Clooney fan, rent something else. But buy the soundtrack CD; the music is great.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
79,DeeNine-2,You're gonna love this movie,9,22 March 2005,"This depression era period piece is simply a delight. The music is wonderful; the fanciful, on the road story of lovable escaped convict country bumpkins, who pratfall their way through numerous scrapes invites hilarity; and the beautifully dove-tailed script by the Coen brothers is marvelous.That script was nominated for the Oscar for Best Screenplay based on material from another medium for 2001, but didn't win. (Stephen Gaghan won for Traffic.) But never mind. The writing is just so clever and that is part of what makes this movie so much fun to watch.That won't surprise viewers who are familiar with the work of Ethan and Joel Coen. Those guys are strikingly original talents who can write comedy and noir with the best of them as in, e.g., Raising Arizona (1987), Blood Simple (1984)--their first, and in some ways, their best--and of course Fargo (1996). Their work is characterized by irony, satirical intent, and sly plotting in which later events are foreshadowed by previous events. O, Brother, Where Art Thou? is especially replete with clever foreshadowing. Characters appear, as they are wont to do in road movies or epic wanderings, and then they are left behind as our heroes move on. Here however, the first appearance of a character is probably not the last appearance. When John Goodman first appears as a morally and ethnically-challenged Bible salesman who welds a mean stick, we may think he is gone, but (I'll keep this vague) when he reappears we are not surprised; in fact his reappearance is just right.One of the highlights is George Clooney as Ulysses Everett McGill whose sweet-smelling Dapper Dan hair pomade plays a bit of a role in the plot. He is perfect as a slick-talking, hairnet-wearing country wordsmith who could charm the birds out of the trees. With the slicked-back hair and the thin moustache, he reminded me a bit of Clark Gable, which is only right since Gable was a thirties film star whose style was much imitated.Clooney is supported by John Turturro, who has played in at least two other Coen and Coen movies that I have seen. He is one of those non-glamorous actors who is at the top of the profession. It may seem a bit of a casting stretch to play him as a Mississippi bumpkin, but he pulls it off. This is the same guy who was just perfect as a New York Jewish writer gone to Hollywood in Coen and Coen's Barton Fink (1991).This is the first time I've seen Tim Blake Nelson, but he was also very good as the third country musketeer. As usual the alluring Holly Hunter gives a solid performance as Everett's estranged wife about to marry another man, the mother of his six daughters. But make no mistake about it, Clooney clearly steals the show, and I am surprised he wasn't nominated for Best Actor. He was really that good. (He did win a Golden Globe award.) And the music: country, bluegrass, hillbilly, gospel, traditional--and I know not what else--is really at the heart of the flick. When the ""Soggy Bottom Boys"" come on with their ""I Am a Man of Constant Sorrow"" it really brings the house down. The Coens know this, and so later in the movie when the boys appear on stage, looking a little like ZZTop on a budget, they reprise it to the delight of the Mississippi folk at a political rally and really get the joint to jumping--and of course it all figures in the plot. And how appropriate is that lyric for a depression era song: ""I Am a Man of Constant Sorrow""! See this for both the Coen Brothers who know how to have fun with a movie, and for George Clooney, who puts on a mighty good show.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon!)","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
80,Screen_Blitz,Depression-era comedy sees the Coen brothers in return in one of their most delightful forms,8,21 November 2016,"Since their entrance into the cinematic realm in 1984 when they brought birth to the thriller 'Blood Simple', Joel and Ethan Coen have proved capable of handling just about every genre they have put in front of them. This feat is often accomplished by their ability to bend genres with their sardonic humor, aberrant characters, and narrative twists; all of which is greatly demonstrated in this comedy starring George Clooney, Tim Blake Nelson, and John Turturro as a trio of hillbillies on a cross-state adventure through the Depression-era Mississippi. Sporting up some unconventional characters, fancy period-appropriate dialogue, and a taste of one of the most lively musical numbers ever brought; this film is just another surprise orchestrated by the Coens, but its a pretty good one to say the least. Set in 1930s, this follows three hillbilly convicts: Everett (played by George Clooney), Pete (played by John Turturro), and Delmar (played by Tim Blake Nelson) who escape from captivity in prison and wander off through the old roads of Mississippi in search of a treasure Everett secretly buried. In the process, they encounter a slew of unexpected figures including Tommy Johnson (played by Chris Thomas King) who sold his soul to the devil to generate his talent as a blue musician, Big Dan (played by John Goodman), a ruthless leader of the Ku Klux Clan, and the law enforcement who sets out to hunt them down.The Coen brothers flourish a handful of surprises for a movie with a title resembling a bible verse (though its confirmed that the title actually derives from a line in a 1941 film 'Sullivan's Travels'). The film is funny, eccentric, and surprisingly heart-filling. The minute our three main characters make their escape, we are introduced to some appropriately quirky characters with eccentric southern dialogue and pop culture references that suites the 1930s period quite well. From there on, the story progresses on these men on some of their most colorful moments including a lively musical number that offers nothing short of charm and fun to listen to. One particular involves a trio encountering three scantily clad women at a pond which leads to shockingly funny end results. Yes, the film does leave a little wiggle room for slightly darker moments which are greatly encountered towards the final act; but the Coen brothers do a genuine job of not escaping their ironically humorous roots. Furthermore, they offer just enough to surprises to make up for a few slogged scenes that don't work well as intended. Regardless, these fine directors know how to keep things moving.When it comes to setting a movie in the Depression-era, it is highly appropriate (though not essential) to go to great lengths to give the film the vintage look and feel of the 1930s. That is where frequent collaborator of the Coens' filmography Roger Deakins and editor Tricia Cooke arrives into the picture. Deakins blesses this beauty with astounding cinematography that is nicely painted with a deep sepia-tone to the film a look of an adventure set in the old Mississippian times. With the use of low saturation and old folk music popular during the Great Depression years, the film effectively fosters an old timely feel of one of America's most unhappy decades. It works pretty conventional, but that's not all. The Coen brothers' have an extremely nifty talent in writing dialogue, and most of it shines through the strong, if a bit eccentric performances by leads George Clooney, John Turturro, and Tim Blake Nelson; all of whom adopt a thick southern accent that feels authentic, though slightly contrived every now and then. This trio of fine actors make the best of their idiosyncratic characters with their charm and darkly funny persona, and the best part is they do not their opportunities to be bring out some good laughs for granted.O Brother Where Art Thou is a splendid comedic piece that sees Coen brothers in one of their freshest, if not classic forms. It is a delightful film filled with just about everything a moviegoer can expect from filmmakers like the Coens, and even it is doesn't go down as a classic, who can deny the immense memorability this film generates.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
81,punishmentpark,"""We thought you was a toad(!).""",8,18 May 2015,"A fine comedy / road movie by the Coens. I never read Homer's 'Oddyssey', but it seems one can do without when watching this. As per usual in a Coens comedy, there are lots of striking, over the top characters here, and I like them a whole lot better than the ones in 'The Hudsucker proxy'. The leading trio reminds me of Laurel and Hardy, especially Tim Blake Nelson looks and acts like the spitting image of Stan Laurel at times.The story is more like a series of events, although towards the end, things are quite neatly tied together. As with some other Coen films, this time around it didn't speak to me as much as it once did, but it's still highly enjoyable, which also had much to do with the loads of fantastic (old country and blues) music, and the terrific (cinematographic) atmosphere of that ol' American South.A good 8 out of 10.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
82,bobsgrock,Looking for logic where there is none.,7,29 December 2009,"There is a line in O Brother, Where Art Thou? that sums up not just the consensus view of this movie, but also that of nearly every Coen Brothers production. George Clooney says to his chained counterpart John Turturro, ""It's a fool that looks for logic in the chambers of the human heart."" Indeed, there may never have been a better and more meaningful statement uttered. For that sums up the total outlook Joel and Ethan have given to us ever since their stunning debut in 1984 with Blood Simple.Although this is not a new concept for them, I think these themes work really well with the setting of this movie, one of the most original in remembrance. Here, we get the story of Homer's The Odyssey set in the 1930s of the American South as three bumbling ex-cons search for a treasure while encountering many obstacles along the way. However, like many a Coen Brothers movie, the plot is just a spot to hang up the arc of the story in order to give way for the really interesting aspects; here being the idiosyncrasies of the characters, the gorgeous wide-screen photography, and the overall crass view of human existence.Through all this, there is a great amount of fun and joy in this story. Clooney is the fast-talking, slick leader of this weirdly likable trio and despite many believing he is too good looking and polished for the role, I believe that only adds to his repertoire, for this Everett needs to be a fast-talker in order to be taken serious because of his looks. Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson add comic support but also depth with their portrayals of Pete and Delmar, chained to Everett and loyal followers the whole way. Even with the clever writing and shifty characters, there is something of a heart behind this story as well as the typical cynicism of the Coens.This is certainly the type of movie that grows on you and multiple viewings are needed not necessarily to understand the plot but to capture the tone and message of the movie; if there is one. Still, if nothing else, one can certainly appreciate the intelligent/stupid mixture of humor the Coens are capable of mixing together so well. Clooney, Turturro and Nelson are wonderful in their respectable roles and of course, Roger Deakins perfectly captures the feeling of the old South with his colorful and rich cinematography. Here is a great looking, fast talking, clever movie with not much of a message. With the Coens in charge, what is the problem?","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
83,Sergiodave,Over-rated,5,15 July 2020,"Had high hopes for this movie after seeing so many great reviews, but by the end was totally deflated. The acting is fine, cinematography is good, but the story just meanders, and the whole package i thought was lightweight. The Coen Brothers have made some great movies, as well as some shockers, I place this just above The Ladykillers and Burn After Reading","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
84,lambiepie-2,They ain't even old timey!,10,16 May 2003,"Gotta tell you, I fell in love with this film. This was not love at first sight, this is a film you can have a relationship with and within that relationship you'd find it endearing, loving and without expecting it, you'd fall in love with it. I am a Cohen Brother's film fan and almost all of their films had the same effect on me. Ya can't immediately fall in love with their films, they take time to enjoy and find out how loving they can be.(Spoilers?) This film is loosely based on Homer's: The Odyssey. (And not Homer Simpson either folks!) Once you know that basic story you begin to find out just how endearing this film really is. Three ex-cons were 'conned' into breaking out of jail and go on quite an adventure. Believable? Hmmmm, maybe. Unbelievable? Hmmmm, maybe. The key line of this film is told right in the beginning by the old man riding the rail when he tells them that they are seeking a treasure, that they will get it but it will not be the one they seek. But that is just what makes this fun. The music is to die for, and to be honest, you don't have to like ""bluegrass"". It has that PLUS other styles as well that adds to the richness of the adventure. George Clooney, whom I don't usually like, turns in a good performance here as well as his ""partners in crime"". The one liners in this film are fun and the actors carry them off well, such as the one I used to summarize the film. Quirky, silly, funny, strange can all be used to sum this film up.One problem I had was that I felt the ending of the film wasn't that great. You could have actually ended the film 15 minutes earlier and it would have been just as fine. It's worth a look...or two, believe you me, you'll find that over a few viewings you'll see it for what it is, a very craftyly done adaptation of an age old story. Like me, you may just grow to like it and hold it dear!","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
85,areatw,Quirky comedy from the Coens,7,12 August 2018,"While not as well-known as some of their other films, 'O Brother' is another great film by the Coens - a unique comedy/adventure with an enjoyable storyline and some genuinely hilarious individual scenes. It's a real whacky, offbeat comedy with equally eccentric characters that isn't intended to be taken seriously. It's clear that this film wants the audience to have fun, and it definitely succeeds.'O Brother' is put together really well. It looks great and is beautifully shot, making the most of the rural setting and stunning scenery. The Coens attention to detail always shines through in their films and this one in particular stands out for how every scene is crafted to perfection. It's difficult to find any technical faults. 'O Brother' is a quirky comedy gem from the Coens - a hugely enjoyable film.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"

87,baumer,It will grow on you,10,25 January 2001,"I have walked out of a Coen movie before and not quite known how to feel. The two best examples of that are The Big Lebowski and Fargo. Lebowski was so ridiculously original and so filled with strange humour that I had to like it. On the other hand, there were some unnecessary reveries with flying people and killer bowling balls that just didn't seem to fit the mold of the film. Still, I liked the film and now own a copy of it. Fargo made me howl with hysterics, sometimes I wasn't sure why I was laughing so hard that it made me cry, but nonetheless I was. There were many seemingly strange characters in Fargo, but upon further investigation, they were really just real people talking about real situations. That is why the man with the shovel ( or was it a broom ) was so side-splittingly funny when he was telling the police officer about some funny looking man down at the bar the other night. And that is also why the theater erupted in laughter when he then says that there are some funny looking clouds coming in. (I own a copy of this film too) The Coen's have a way of masking their film and their characters as being somewhat eccentric and perhaps a little off the wall. But if you look closer at some of those same characters that seem zany, you will always find that in some strange way, they all ring true. That is what is quite exceptional about O Brother Where Art Thou? This is a film that is out there. I mean it is not even in the same ballpark as a traditional film. I reviewed the film Shaft this past summer and in it I said that Shaft was an okay film that I have seen a thousand times before. But you can not say that about a Coen Brother's film and you most certainly can not say that about this one.This film has everything in it from a jail break, crooked southern politicians, muses, references to what I can only assume are historical figures, riverside baptisms, bank robberies, violence towards animals, singing flocks of religious fanatics, KKK, lynch mobs and so on. There are obviously many references to Homer's Odyssey in here as well, but I wouldn't know that because I have never read Homer's Odyssey or even knew one thing about it. Every other newspaper reviewer seems to know all about it and they think that this cynicism and almost spoof-like quality towards it makes the film that much better. Well coming from a guy who doesn't know anything about it, I can tell you that it is still an entertaining film. There were times when again, as is usual for a Coen film, I wasn't sure why I was entertained or laughing, but I was.This is a road picture where three men travel along the way to find a hidden treasure that Clooney says he has hidden to his two other cell mates. He has to take them along because they were also chained to him when they had their chance to escape.I like all the principal actors in the film and many of them are Coen cronies. It was nice to see Goodman again. It was nice to see Hunter and especially Turturro who seems to have a place in every Coen film. It's too bad they didn't find a place for Steve Buscemi but that is a different story all together. But back to Clooney. The man just has charisma. He is a one hell of an actor as well and here he is not quite as zany as the others but even he has his own idiosyncrasies. His work here is quite awesome and I really hope this shows that he is capable of playing any range of character.Now after heaping all this praise on the film, let me just say this as well. I didn't really enjoy the film at first. I found it to be quite tedious and a little boring. There were too many ideas in here and not enough care went into harnessing them for all what they were worth. But then the film began to grow on me. It took a while but it did grow on me. I don't think this is their best film, but it is still a good one and I am giving it a 8.5. But the reason that I do recommend this film is for one reason only.Every day you can go look into the paper and look at the films that are playing and say to yourself, seen it, seen it, oh, seen it last year, that is the same as this film and that is the same as that film. Most films have been recycled in some form or another. Not the Coen's films. They have not been recycled and if they have I don't know about it. That is reason enough to see something that they put out. Originality counts for a lot in my books. The Coens are original and they are good. And that is not common in todays cinema. Enjoy them while they are allowed to make films. Because you don't get vision like this in many films, so when you do, enjoy it!","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
88,kevin c,odyssey,7,18 September 2000,"You can always rely on the Coen Brothers to try something original and fresh. This is an excellent comedy, with Clooney especially showing he's come on so well. Can you believe he was Batman? Even the music becomes quite catchy after an hour or so. Give it a go, you won't regret it.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
89,mentalcritic,The most fun I've ever had watching a (relatively) non-violent film...,10,6 January 2001,"If nothing else, this film proves just how short-changed we've been by the music industry since about 1985 or so. When I was told the film relies on numerous American musical numbers from the 1930s, I was expecting to spend a lot of time squirming in my seat from sheer agony. Surprisingly, I almost felt compelled to sing along with whomever dubbed the vocals, a radical difference compared to the mood that the crappy synthetic drum-machine garbage of such films as The Corruptor and The Replacement Killers puts me in. If I could put the music of this film in the same boat as one that is set in modern times, it'd be Desperado. The reliance upon musical talent rather than trendiness to sell this component of the film works well in its overall favour.That is not to say the film's only plus is the music. The cinematography is beautiful, and it will teach you why television screens are being made wider with the advent of digital television. If anyone tries to tell the distributor they want a panned and scanned version of this film, I'm going to kick their butts into the middle of the 22nd century. Even when there is nothing going on outside of the central focus of the shot, the wide, sweeping plains of 1930s America keep one's eyes focused upon the entire picture, not just whomever happens to be speaking. This is why 16x9 Enhanced DVD is the ONLY way to view films.George Clooney is delightful in his role as Ulysses Everett McGill, while John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson provide wonderful comic fodder in their roles. Chris Thomas King is delightful as Tommy Johnson, the guitarist who sold his soul to the devil at the crossroads. Their recording session was delightful to sit through, and it is a hilarious reflection on the times that they could cut a record while on the run, and then travel across the state, blissfully unaware that they have a number one record on their hands. Contrast this with modern pop ""stars"" who can't get enough of themselves or their record company's attempts to make them out to be the greatest thing since sliced bread. There is a moral to this part of the story: truly good music only needs word of mouth to make people want to listen to it.Oh, and the Sirens scene... now that was worth watching the entire film for, even if it was quite bizarre. In five minutes, we have a more pleasant image to look at than the entirety of Sirens, the meandering (not to mention ugly) film of Norman Lindsay's story that was filmed not far from where I live. I thoroughly recommend this film. It succeeded in entertaining me beyond my most generous expectations.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
90,mattymatt4ever,Entertaining,7,13 July 2001,"I can't say I enjoyed this as much as ""The Big Lebowski"" or ""Raising Arizona,"" and felt a little slighted, but ""O Brother"" is an enjoyable film worthy of some good laughs and a taste of the Coens' brisk, twisted sense of creativity.  The DVD edition contains the featurette, and I was interested to find out that the Coens are pretty simple in their directorial techniques.  That surprised me!  Of course, this movie is not the best example (and I'm only saying this in comparison) and it wasn't worthy of any Oscars (many feel it was robbed), but maybe it depends on the appeal. 
Though I enjoyed the Coens' previous work, I've never been a fan of old westerns or ""The Dukes of Hazzard"" or any of that stuff they show daily on TNN.  I guess that's why I didn't feel as enthusiastic about checking out this movie, seeing that it revolves around Southern folk.  For all those from the South who are reading this, I don't mean to offend ANY of your people!  I'm sure you guys feel the same way when you watch movies about urban areas like ""A Bronx Tale.""  When you live in the city all your life, it's hard to get accustomed to films of this nature.  But all apologies aside, I found the characters fun and quirky.  I think John Turturro nailed the accent perfectly, and seeing the way he talks in real life I find that amazing.  Tim Blake Nelson was also good.  Of course, George Clooney--who I assume is not the best at feigning accents, judging by his decision to chuck the idea of working with a dialogue coach and developing a New England accent for ""The Perfect Storm""--naturally seems a little miscast and continually struggles with the accent.  His performance was good, though. You can also spot Coen regulars like Holly Hunter (in a short but sweet role) and John Goodman (also on screen for a short time, but steals every minute of it).Though I don't normally dig country music, I liked the title song ""A Man of Constant Sorrow.""  The DVD also contains the music video for that song. 
Overall, I found the film entertaining and original, but it doesn't have that in-your-face quality that the Coens have shown to us in the past.  It's a slighter effort, but a good one.  I still suggest you check it out. 
My score:  7 (out of 10)","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
91,hall895,The Odyssey with music and laughs,6,1 August 2015,"The Coen brothers present a reasonably entertaining comedy very loosely based on Homer's Odyssey. The hero of this film's journey is Everett, whose first name is actually Ulysses, and whose story parallels that of Homer's hero. But Everett's story is very much unique, the Coens take a rough outline from Homer and then make the story all their own. The story unfolds in rural Mississippi in 1937, a unique and, as we will come to see, rather strange place. Everett is an escaped convict who has two companions on his journey. Pete and Delmar were chained to Everett at the time of his escape, he convinced them to go along with him by filling their heads with a story of buried treasure. They lose the chains, will they find the treasure? The first person they stumble upon after their escape tells them they will find a fortune, but not the one they seek. Interesting. What will fate have in store for our trio at the end of their arduous journey? This is a comedy film which has its funny moments but the film is rather uneven. The laughs don't come as consistently as you would like. It is music more than comedy which really sparks the film to life. Everett, Pete and Delmar end up unwitting radio stars, the Soggy Bottom Boys. Their hit song, Man of Constant Sorrow, is a treat. The film has a good, lively mix of folk and bluegrass music throughout. So, the music is fun. The story doesn't quite match the music though. There are times where things move a little too slowly, times where things get a little too weird. At one point Delmar is convinced Pete has been turned into a toad. Yes, weird indeed. Delmar is a bit of a dim bulb, Pete isn't much brighter. Everett is the brains of the operation but, while he's got a quick wit, he's surely no genius either. There are times when the dimness of the trio is endearing, but there are times where it wears thin too.Everett, Pete and Delmar are certainly the focus of the story but they meet plenty of interesting characters on their Homer-inspired journey. And, keeping with the offbeat theme of the entire film, many of these characters are exceedingly odd. This really is a strange film but the Coens pull it all together reasonably well. George Clooney, playing Everett, is a good star to build around. Clooney brings real personality to the role. John Turturro, as Pete, and Tim Blake Nelson, as Delmar, complement Clooney well. There may be times the story drags, times where the comedy misses the mark. But it is not the fault of the performers, everyone suits their role very well. John Goodman and Holly Hunter are among those who pop into the film, portraying characters who take the story in some surprising directions. It seems a simple story, that of Everett and friends on an ordinary journey. But there is nothing ordinary about the world of this film. The Coens have populated this world with some supremely strange people. And that makes for a decent bit of fun. Maybe the film doesn't always work as well as it should but it perks up enough here and there to keep you interested and entertained. Things get a little bizarre at times but there is some fun in that too. And the music keeps things lively, you'll be clamoring for more of the Soggy Bottom Boys. This is certainly not the greatest comedy the Coens ever produced. But it's good enough to satisfy.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
92,sharky_55,Hot damn! It's the Soggy Bottom Boys!,9,17 August 2015,"O Brother Where Art Thou is a magical retelling of Homer's Odyssey weaved through rural Mississippi during the great depression. The Coens draw us into the setting with ease; times of economic desperation, growth of chain stores (and stay out of Woolsworths!), the rise and spread of music through radio, populist politicians appealing through sweeping campaigns and folksy country western music, racial tensions behind public image...There's also the reference's to the Greek myth that blend seamlessly with the period piece: a boisterous and large man as Polyphemus (John Goodman), three haunting and mesmerising girls bathing by the river as the Sirens, a prophetic blind old man as Tiresias...The film blends this narrative with its setting so well, at times almost dream like in its atmosphere - take the soul-stirring choral rendition of Down to the River to Pray by a mass of baptismees, as the camera gracefully unveils the progression heading to down the river and Everett and Delmar's conversation about gophers comes to a standstill in amazement. Confronted with a lush green Mississippi upon principal photography, the Coens enlisted long time collaborator Roger Deakins to oversee a ground-breaking digital colour correction process that saw the fields of green turned into a dry and dusty rural canvas. The browns of the sepia tone seep into the frame and enhance the already dirty and ragged look of our trio of escapees (mistakenly identified as coloured after days of weary grimy travel by the KKK). Whenever you get the chance, make sure you watch the correct version with this post production process in it, otherwise be treated with garishly jarring green fields in the background. And of course the boys hauling the blocks of dripping ice across the fields becomes a less immersive image.George Clooney plays the leading man Ulysses Everett McGill, full of charm and suaveness. Twice he wakes up from his slumber to worries of his perfect hair being ruined (I'm a Dapper Dan man!), and despite his overall easiness and wisdom he still exhibits some peculiar insecurities or emotional tangents, but his best lines come from his exasperation or cheerful sardonic quips (Well, ain't this place a geographical oddity. Two weeks from everywhere! and Baptism! You two are just dumber than a bag of hammers!). The second smartest of the three is Pete Hogwallop, despite his name possessing heart, with Turturro hitting a wide range of notes including the absurd (Do. Not. Seek. The. Treasure) and over-the-top humour (I'm gonna kill you, Judas Iscariot Hogwallop!). The funniest is Delmar, played with such heart and good intentions by Tim Blake Nelson, always curious but naive (We thought you was a toad!). There's a sort of gullible and lovable idiocy about Delmar that can only be displayed by Nelson and that big smile, whether it's the grand sweeping gesture as he indicates that the water is indeed fine, or the sympathy he shows for the livestock. Delmar is the glue that holds the group together (Okay, I'm with you fellas). If you haven't already figured out, OBWAT is endlessly quotable. They're joined by a varied host of colourful and memorable characters, like the humble Tommy, a black guitarist who sold his soul to the devil for his wicked talent, the well rounded and grinning Nelson, feared through the state for his machine gun and babyface (but don't say that in front of him), the well endowed Pappy O'Daniel and his escort, irate but a politician through and through, and the reform candidate Homer Stokes, well mannered and good natured but possessing seedier ideals underneath. He's revealed as the Imperial Wizard of the KKK at a nightime rally, the mass choreography and the fiery chants managing to look ominous and over-the-top ridiculous at the same time. But what would OBWAT be without it's immensely successful and award winning soundtrack, that perfectly sets the mood for the southern Depression-era tale? It features a impressive cast of country, bluegrass and folk musicians: Emmylou Harris, Alison Krauss, Norman Blake, Ralph Stanley and of course the jaunty and effortless voice of Dan Tyminski on the iconic Man of Constant Sorrow. That and many of the rustic two and three part harmonies blend so easily in the story world and with those warm accompaniments of guitar, mandolins and banjos. Who didn't cheer when Delmar and and Pete launching straight into the harmonious intro in that hall? Its musical romp is simply infectious. As the radio station manager says, it's some mighty fine a-pickin' and a-singin.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
93,Beta_Gallinger,A good comedy adventure set in 1930s Mississippi,8,5 September 2007,"I first learned about this movie years ago, possibly around the time it was first released, and first heard ""I am a Man of Constant Sorrow"" from the soundtrack soon afterwards. However, it wasn't until just over a year ago that I finally actually saw ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" (I guess that was because I didn't watch many movies during the early 2000s). With my first viewing, I wasn't amazed, but it was still enough for me to give positive feedback, and I don't think that changed with my very recent second viewing.The story is loosely based on the ancient poem, ""The Odyssey"", by Homer, but takes place in Mississippi, during the Great Depression of the 1930s. Ulysses Everett McGill, Pete, and Delmar are three convicts who escape from a chain gang. After doing so, they set out on a journey to reach the buried loot that Everett speaks of! Along their way, they encounter many people who influence their trip, and may cause them trouble, including sirens, a crazy bankrobber named George ""Babyface"" Nelson, a Bible salesman named Big Dan Teague, a Ku Klux Klan lynch mob, etc. Trying to avoid being caught is not the only challenge that these three convicts have to face! I'm not sure about the first time I watched this, but while I watched it a second time, I had trouble staying into it early in the film, and trouble seeing the motion picture as much of a comedy. However, I eventually found myself more into it, and started laughing more, even though I may not have found any of the gags absolutely hilarious. Overall, ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" is a good comedy adventure (not great, but good), with the memorable ""I am a Man of Constant Sorrow"" song, as well as some crazy characters (which is mostly what makes it funny), for those who want that.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
94,jhclues,"The One ""Sullivan"" Wanted To Make",10,12 February 2001,"Producers/writers/directors Joel and Ethan Coen evoke the essence of such classic films as `Sullivan's Travels' and `I Am A Fugitive From A Chain Gang,' with their Depression Era comedy, `O Brother Where Art Thou?' directed by Joel Coen and starring George Clooney.  Borrowing the title of the `meaningful' film that successful comedy filmmaker Sullivan wanted to make in the 1941 Preston Sturges film `Sullivan's Travels,' and finally-- in reality-- making it, is only the beginning of this clever, funny tale based on Homer's `The Odyssey.'  The hero here is one Ulysses Everett McGill (Clooney), who along with two others, Pete (John Turturro) and Delmar (Tim Blake Nelson), escapes from a chain gang, commencing an `odyssey' for the trio wherein they ultimately traverse many of the railroads, back roads and tank-water towns scattered throughout the good State of Mississippi.  It becomes an adventure of the first magnitude as the three cohorts encounter situations and characters that are humorous and sometimes poignant, and-- for the audience-- always fun.  It's a richly woven tapestry of Americana (including plenty of traditional music) that is bound to leave an indelible impression in the mind of the viewer. 	Leading man Clooney has one of his best character roles yet-- it's a Clooney we've never quite seen before-- and he is more than up to the task. Invested with the mustache and rugged good looks of Clark Gable, and with his natural charisma working overtime, he creates a likable, articulate character that stands out in marked contrast to just about every other character in the film.  And he's a joy to watch; his Ulysses is a real kick from start to finish, and it's a performance that is worthy of an Oscar. Turturro, as well, creates one of his most memorable screen characters, drawing heavily upon the naturally quirky side of his own personality and accentuating his own unique physical traits which lend themselves so well to the embodiment of Pete.  And Nelson does the same with his Delmar; like Turturro, he successfully captures the soul of the character, both physically and emotionally, and-- it must be mentioned-- both actors (with Coen's help, of course) manage to avoid the trap of making their characters mere stereotypes, and it's one of the reasons they are so engaging:  These guys are the genuine article. 	The extraordinary supporting cast, all of whom individually create truly original characters in their own right, includes Holly Hunter (Penny), John Goodman (Big Dan), Chris Thomas King (Tommy), Charles Durning (Pappy O'Daniel), Del Pentecost (Junior O'Daniel) and Michael Badalucco in a memorable turn as George `Babyface' Nelson.  Not content to sit on their laurels, the Coen Brothers constantly seek to expand the boundaries of their personal cinematic universe, and they succeed splendidly with `O Brother Where Art Thou?'  It's a rousingly warm and witty and-- most importantly-- highly entertaining and creative film that takes the viewer on an unforgettable journey.  The Coen's distinct imprint, like the cinematic equivalent of The Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval, is stamped on every frame of the film, and it's like an assurance of quality and a good time to be had by all.  There's magic in the movies the Coen Brothers make, and this one goes far toward proving what anyone who has followed their movies over the years knows already:  Nobody does it quite like Joel and Ethan.  This one is not to be missed.  I rate this one 10/10.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
95,aciessi,Oh Brother.,5,8 December 2020,"This film is ambitious and well-intentioned. It's Homer's Odyssey in the Deep South. Honestly, it should be a masterpiece. But, it never gets off the ground. Unlike The Big Lebowski and Raising Arizona, O Brother can't commit to being a comedy. That's the fatal flaw. I kept thinking that I needed to be laughing and I wasn't. It's also too jolly and whimsical to be a drama. When it goes for a big moment.. man, is it awkward.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
96,CharltonBoy,Another bore from the Coen Brothers.,3,13 April 2001,"I have cime to the conclusion that when it comes to films from the Coen brothers there is conspiracy going on. First it was Fargo,then The Big Lebowski and now this. Each of these films were given rave reviews for being classic comedies, the question is WHY????????????? Fargo was dull and if it wasnt for Willam H Macy would have been unwatchable. The Big Lebowski was as funny as piles and now this film takes the biscuit! O Brother Where Art Thou? is as unfunny as it is boring. Nothing of any significance happens to make the viewer laugh. Nothing happens to make this film interesting in ANY way. Goerge Clooney does his best but the poor script makes it impossible for him to come out of this with any merit. Who ever decided that this rubbish should be rewarded with a Golden Globe had fall for what most critics have...The Coen Con! I'm pleased to say i'm not following like all the other sheep, this film Stinks! 3 out of 10.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
97,gbheron,"Very Good Movie, Better Soundtrack",9,18 January 2002,"""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"", a retelling of the Odyssey but plomped in 1930s Mississippi, has its champions and detractors. I'm a champion, but understand what the detractors are saying. One criticism is that the movie doesn't hold together, that it's too disjointed. I agree it doesn't have a strong narrative flow, but that's not much of a drawback. The movie is morality play, it's written in crayon, not with a word processor. Criticism two is that it's not on par with the Coens other work like ""Blood Simple"" and ""Fargo"". So what? It's not supposed to be. And the soundtrack?  It's one of the best in years, and worth the price of a rental by itself.  I found OBWAT a very entertaining movie and definitely worth a rental.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"

It figures the Academy wouldn't even nominate it.This is a TERRIFIC recreation of an era, every bit as impressive as ""Titanic"" and ""LA Confidential"".  Even better, this is laugh out loud funny"".  Very loosely based on ""The Odyssey"" by Homer, this story of three dim bulb convicts escaping a chain gang to recover a ""treasure"" in Depression-era Mississippi boasts terrific performances, great production values and much good humor.  Most outstanding is George Clooney (!!!???) as Ulysses.  Ulysses talks ""smart,"" but he is every bit as thick as his partners.  He is the perfect example of ""starting with an incorrect premise and using perfect logic and reason to come to an incorrect conclusion.""  Clooney well deserves his Golden Globe award and should have received an Oscar.The Coen Brothers have a terrific talent for taking unfilmable material and making great movies.  This movie seems closest in spirit to their near masterpiece, ""Raising Arizona,"" another live action feature length cartoon which was never tiring.  Part of the Coens's brilliance is that they can brutally satirize their characters and communities without being condescending.  They have retold ""The Odyssey"" if it were told by the classically great country comedy team Homer and Jethro. This is a movie to be enjoyed through repeat viewings, far and away the best film of 2001.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
99,Holt344,Coen Brother's masterpiece,10,19 November 2018,"The Coen brothers created a superb adventure comedy about three well written convicts played by there great actors; George Clooney, John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson, their chemistry and acting made the characters feel alive. The hair pomade, great running gag!
The side characters were also funny and well written, George Nelson being my favorite.
Comedy was clever written, made me laugh and it felt natural and not forced.The cinematography and the soundtrack was the other two main things that made this a perfect movie. I'm a fan of the genre so I loved it, but for everyone else, I believe they will feel the same, critics did.
I've to say this was so much better the second time, I watched it back in 5th grade, I sure didn't know much about movies back then. Superb movie!","O Brother, Where Art Thou"

T-Bone Burnett supplied an impeccable collection of traditional country and bluegrass songs for the soundtrack. O Brother, Where Art Thou? was the first time a digital intermediate was used on the entirety of a first-run Hollywood film which otherwise had very few visual effects.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"

This time I was much less disappointed than I was with Fargo and I must say that most of the credit for that goes to the good jokes and the good acting of George Clooney. Well done Mr. Clooney, make more of these and less 'Perfect Stormish' movies. You can act and you showed it here.7 out of 10","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
102,SmileysWorld,Charming recall of days past.,8,8 January 2005,"What we have here,is a charming fictional story with a much more wholesome period in American history as it's backdrop.Though I personally was not around in the 1930's,it's clear that the Coen Brothers remained as true to the depression era south as they possibly could.Also worthy of note is the film's soundtrack.The music is beautifully placed in the film,and is such a prominent part of the overall film that it can almost be considered an additional cast member. It contains songs that came from the heart of the songwriters,rather than board rooms filled with greedy record executives.Very enriching. The cast was excellent,with nearly flawless performances across the board.The only trouble with the film in my view is the depiction of cruelty to animals,which I am always against.Setting that aside,I have no doubt that this will be regarded as one the great films of the new century.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
103,Angry_Arguer,Leaving the Basics,10,14 February 2004,"After the disaster that was 'Raising Arizona', the Coens worked and worked until they created this.  As opposed to Paul Verhoeven, who hasn't changed his method since RoboCop, the Coens are an interesting pair.  Even in their failures (except 'Intolerable') their work is something to behold.  This isn't a failure.The music is the undercurrent of the film, not the characters.  I frankly don't care for the particular country style (I could live without it),  but it serves its purpose as supporting the period.  We've certainly changed as a society in the last 70 years, hallelujah.The Coens have the story structured wonderfully.  I thought a nonlinear timeline would work great for this story until I watched it again and realized that it is a nonlinear Odyssey.  Heck, it's better than the Odyssey!What I really like is Clooney.  His character is a mix of his 'Three Kings' major with 'Ferris Bueller'.  Instead of obviously winking at the audience, he does it unconsciously.  That's a tougher skill to master and he pulls it off really good.  Can Hanks do the same for 'Ladykillers'?Final Analysis = = Learn from this...","O Brother, Where Art Thou"

The story follows 3 convicts escape from hard labour in Mississipi. The acting and soundtrack are both excellent, but the script isn't that compelling. 7/10","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
105,EijnarAmadeus,"Strange, beautiful, funny and slick",8,8 July 2003,"O BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU? (2000) spoilers((( George Clooney, John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson plays the three main characters in this adventure / satire / crime of a movie where the whole plot is about:Clooney plays Everett, he has a wife and daughters. But the problem is that he is sitting in jail with his two buddies Pete and Delmar. So the two of them run away, and the only way Everett get the two of them to take that risk, is that he tells them there's a big treasure hidden someplace. So they set out and soon they'll meet a lot of strange happenings like a Bible - salesman that's a member of Ku Klux Klan, they'll sing in a single and be a huge hit, they'll meet sensual clothes washers, they'll meet a loser bandit that shoots on cows...I mean, it is a adventure movie with laughs, high dramatics and family problems and the movie is: great. Joel and Ethan Coen has done one of their finest jobs (if you're looking away from Fargo) and the three actors are great together. You can't expect a pure comedy when you're going to see this movie, cause it really ain't. It is more like a satire...a crime/adventure, it's hard to put a word on it. But it is very nice wathcing especially the song they sing ""I'm a man of constant sorrow"", great!! The movie has a special mood that keeps it going, and off course there are dark sides as when the three of them dress up like Ku Klux Klan members, saves a negro friend and then kills a bunch of them, I laughed. It has a sweet style with the fine ending of Everett getting together with his wife and as we leave them we see this man on a rail that we also saw in the beginning of the movie, that makes a time perspective.

Ulysses Everett McGill (George Clooney) has just escaped prison with two cell mates Pete Hogwallop (John Tuturro) and Delmar O'Donnell (Tim Blake Nelson). Ulysses tells Pete and Delmar that they have escaped to go find a fortune but it's really so Ulysses can get back together with his wife (Holly Hunter) who divorced him when he was sent to jail. Along the way they meet all kinds of characters. They meet Tommy Johnson (Chris Thomas King) a guitarist who sold his soul to the devil, George ""Baby Face"" Nelson (Michael Badalucco) a high strung prohibition gangster, and Daniel ""Big Dan"" Teague (John Goodman) a one eyed Bible salesman who is secretly a Ku Klux Klan member. They are being chased by a Sheriff (Daniel Von Bargen) who loses them at every turn. Eventually they make it to Ulysses' wife who demands her ring back. When they go get it they are caught by the police. But then a massive flood comes in and sweeps them away. I love this movie. It's funny, engaging, and of course has that Coen feel to it.

I've read Homer's Odyssey, seen Preston Sturges's Sullivan's travels and all of Joel and Ethan's major films.  I love this one.  Why?  Interestingly enough, reading the comments by those who didn't like this film revealed more about the tastes of the reviewers than any real substance about the film.  Some didn't like ""abusing animals,"" Clooney's dialect, or Klansmen marching in a Busby Berkeley parody.  All well and good.  Let's be perfectly politically correct and inoffensive...something Joel and Ethan don't do so well.  Page, Turturro and Clooney are great.  So are Durning and Goodman.  In fact, everyone was great.  There were no soft spots in the acting.  I especially loved the  folks down at home.  No cute little yuppie extras.  Those folks looked like Depression era Mississippians.  But seriously, folks.

But no! This contrived comedy with music just went down-hill after that.  Oh dear! just tell me when to laugh. The Ku Klux Klan scene was quite striking though it did not go anywhere, the ""sirens"" in their wet clinging garments were nicely seductive, the idea of carrying around a friend (turned into a toad) in a little box was intriguing and a furious escape from a barn all ablaze was exciting enough, but.... May be it was the melodramatic delivery of the lines and the strain of trying to understand the assumed southern accents that got at me.

110,Blue-Grotto,20th Anniversary!,10,18 September 2020,"""O Muse! Sing in me, and through me tell the story of that man skilled in all the ways of contending, a wanderer, harried for years on end.""Sirens, cyclops, oracles, villains, and heroes from ancient Greece assume new forms in 1930s Mississippi in this whimsical, brilliant, funny, and deeply American Odyssey.Three prisoners on a work crew escape into the countryside. While the iron chain that binds them is soon broken, it is replaced by a stronger bond, friendship. This new link is tested repeatedly and relentlessly by a diabolical sheriff, Klansmen, con men, scheming relatives, alluring women, charred gopher, bad hair and other monstrosities, but luck, desperation, a talent for music and the inveterate resourcefulness of the trio gets them out of much of the trouble that their impulsiveness leads them into. Deeper problems are their own demons. The unlikely companions travel across Mississippi in search of a treasure that proves illusory, but a much more valuable fortune awaits.O Brother, Where Art Thou is a thick slice of Americana. Much of this comes from the bluegrass soundtrack. I fell in love with the sound along with singer Gillian Welch. Cinematographer Roger Deakins is at the height of his creative powers as he brews something modern and antique at the same time. His images are a little grainy and blurry, which gives them the historical feel, but the composition and quality do not suffer for it. One of the best things about the writing and directing of the Coen brothers is balance. Each character has strengths and weaknesses, good and bad, flaws and noble aspects, and this is in accord with human nature. The stories told by the Coens are drenched in truth and authenticity. Actors George Clooney, John Turturro, Tim Blake Nelson, John Goodman and Holly Hunter are perfectly cast and amazing in their roles. I laughed so hard I lost my breath when Delmar (Nelson) was convinced the sirens turned his friend into a toad, and when Big Dan (Goodman) squishes it. There is satisfactory depth to the film with its references to the Odyssey, the themes of racial harmony, love and politics, the beautiful images and more. It is one of my favorite films.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
111,Movie-12,"One of the worst movies released in a long time; pointless, and absolutely moronic. * (out of four).",2,18 February 2001,"The Coen brothers are very gifted filmmakers. Considering some of my all time favorite movies, including ""Fargo,"" ""Blood Simple,"" and ""Raising Arizona,"" were products of their excessive capability of making good productions only contributes to the enormous disappointment of their latest effort, ""Oh Brother, Where Art Thau?"" It is as if they took several bad actors to play bad characters thrown in a bad script with bad dialogue and bad situations. Everything about this movie is bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. The movie is a complete waste of 106 minutes of your life. It makes sitting on the couch watching ""Survivor"" look good. I am sorry to say this but I may hold this one against the Coen brothers for some time to come.""Oh Brother, Where Art Thau?"" is your standard road/buddy comedy, but missing comedy, laughs, insight, and interest. The story feels tedious, yawn-inducing, slow-moving and ridiculously stupid. It takes place in 1937, in Mississippi where three convicts escape from a pretty chain gang. They are Ulysses Everett McGill (George Clooney), Delmar (Time Blake Nelson), and Pete (John Turturro), who quickly find themselves discussing their dreams with a crazy blind seer. This man explains the three escapees must travel a long and difficult path before they find a treasure at the bottom of a lake in four days. Being the absolute idiots they are, Pete, McGill, and Delmar find themselves following the advice of this clearly eccentric drifter.The three idiots are pursued by various other characters, including a local sheriff (Daniel Von Bargen) who's bound and determined to bring the criminals to justice, a young musician (Chris Thomas King) who sold his soul to the devil in exchange for musical abilities, George ""Baby Face"" Nelson (Michael Badalucco), a manic depressive bank robber with machine guns up the wazoo, Big Dan Teague (John Goodman), a deceptive one-eyed bible salesman, and incumbent Governor Pappy O'Daniel (Charles Durning) in a close campaign with Homer Stokes (Wayne DuVall), whose manager (Ray McKinnon) is married to McGill's ex-wife, Penny (Holly Hunter).""Oh Brother, Where Art Thau?"" is a moronic shadow of ""Of Mice and Men,"" minus the legitimate plot and defined character intentions. This film contains the most annoying of characters; they are bland, boring, dual, dumb, negative-adjective inspiring. What is that you say? The movie's intentions were to induce laughs through the stupidity of the characters? Well, if that were the case I think I would have laughs, or even smiled at that. I found myself moaning and groaning in disgust and agony. Not a single character is the least bit intriguing. That is one of the biggest problems the movie makes, finding a character in which audiences can relate. Maybe if the characters were introduced or developed, or had the slightest interesting personality, then there may have been some involvement.albeit not much.The dialogue is typical redneck blahblah, wooden and straightforward. There is little creativity or sharpness in the writing. The screenplay, by Joel and Ethan Coen, based on a poem by Homer, puts you right to sleep, especially in the scenes where the outlaws sit around campfires exchanging depressing, meaningless gibber jabber. The soundtrack is equally as painful, consisting of irritating old-fashion country music, and even some numbers sang by the characters themselves. Those scenes, dragged on way too long, are irrelevant to the story. All of these horrible qualities precede an ending that is not satisfying and inconclusive.""Oh Brother, Where Art Thau?"" is just a really dumb movie; there is no other way to explain the quality. It is just really dumb. Not in a funny way. Not in a slapstick way. Not even in a bad movie sort of way. It is inexplicably dumb. Dumb. Dumb. Dumb. Oh, yeah, did I mention that this movie is dumb. Still considering going to see this junk? Fine, but do not say I didn't warn you.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
112,the red duchess,"So much brilliance, yet...",5,8 November 2000,"The Coens use their two sources wisely, if not well.  Like 'Sullivan's Travels', the narrative is not a 'realistic' straightforward story, despite the attention to period detail, but a Frankenstein's monster made up from different bits of movies of the time, the musical, the gangster movie, the chain-gang movie, the socially conscious movie, like a Frankenstein's monster.  Similarly, the allusions to Ulysses are overturned - Penelope is not faithful, Ulysses is beaten up by the Cyclops.  It depends on how you take all this - the Coens suggest not too seriously.  This is probably just as well, because the implications of the fascist basis of American popular culture and democracy are kind of alarming.  This is my least favourite Coens movie, irritating as much as it astonishes.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"

While Fargo and the Big Lebowski were excellent, they seem to have this obsession with symbolism.In the Big Lebowski it was a rug, in this film it's the tin of hair gel. Bizarre.  It got a bit off putting by the end actually.This wasn't as good as some of their other writing accomplishments, but is a well told little tale without ever jumping out at you as being an outstanding film.Clooney is as good as ever, and someone in the theatre was even stupid enough to think that the signing tracks were George himself, D'uh!","O Brother, Where Art Thou"

115,khatcher-2,Attractive and entertaining,6,25 September 2003,"Though the story is not all that special - we have seen numerous stories of convicts on the run - this film is ultimately attractive for a number of different reasons. The interpretations displayed by the three run-aways is always acceptable or better, the photography is excellent, and a few songs from country' and negro spirituals add fine-tasting ingredients to the proceedings. Together with some handsome cars from the 1930's, the whole is an entertaining result - as long as you are not looking for anything too deep, philosophical or otherwise intellectual. Thus religious references - including the Ku Klux Klan - should not be taken seriously. Indeed, that is part of the point the Coen brothers - Jewish in origin - wanted to make: being neutral or non-believer often allows you to open your eyes to other points of view and not be critical of those who profess other religions. Which is perhaps the best religion of all .............I cannot think of any other film at this moment in which George Clooney as Ulysses communicated to me better than in this film ......... or even John Turturro, come to think of it. The three escaped convicts played really likeable characters, which overode any shallowness the story-line might have had. Whether the original Odyssey by Homer really has much to do with this film is up to you: obviously it is with no disrespect nor by fortuitous accident, that the rotund politician went by the name of Homer, as well as the evident connection with the use of Ulysses. However, all that Mississippi countryside was filmed lovingly, with exquisite care playing with the sunlight.I certainly found this film more attractively entertaining than the other famous film by the Coen brothers, `The big Lebowsky', and is worth the high side of 6½ on my scale.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
116,WriterDave,A-Musing Oddity from Coen Brothers,9,14 June 2003,"By sheer dumb luck, this film became the Coen Brother's highest grossing film ever. Essentially this is Homer's Odyssey by way of the Three Stooges. Everyone in the cast seems to be having a good ol' time. To get an idea of the sense of humor running through the film, witness about 90 minutes through the most beautifully staged and choreographed Clan rally ever put to film. There's plenty of Depression-era shenanigans and Southern fried humor throughout. Cinematographer Roger Deakins does here for color and the South what later he did for black and white and suburban California in his next collaboration with the Coen brothers, ""The Man Who Wasn't There."" He turns photographing shades, shadows, colors and textures into high art. This ain't no ""Fargo"", folks. It's not even as deep as say, oh, ""The Big Lebowski."" The Coen brothers really don't have much to say here, but I'll be damned if I didn't get caught up in the old timey spirit of it all. In one of the strangest pop-culture phenomenas of the past ten years, the old timey bluegrass soundtrack went on to become more popular than the film and swept the Grammy Awards. I dare you not to tap your feet while Clooney and the gang schuck and jive their way on home.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
117,LebowskiT1000,Coen Brothers do it again!!!,9,15 February 2002,"I've seen just about all of the Coen brothers' films now, and I have to say this is one of their better films.  I wouldn't dare say it's better than ""The Big Lebowski"", but it was very good in it's own right.I thought the story was very interesting and hilarious at times.  I loved all the characters, especially Tim Blake Nelson (Delmar) and John Turturro's (Pete).There really isn't anything bad I can say about this movie, but this movie isn't for everyone.  It might be safe to say that if you liked the other Coen brothers' films, then you'll hopefully like this one too.  And if you liked what you saw in the trailer, I think you'll like the film, but don't hold me to it.Anyhow, I hope that you like(d) the film as much as I do.

118,johnnymonsarrat,"Jon Monsarrat review: Accessible to non-arty types, best of Coen brothers",10,3 May 2002,"I'm an action movie buff and typically don't take a hankerin' to arty films. I just don't have the sophistication or film school training to appreciate the cinematography or makeup or score if the plot is bad.But I was really dazzled by ""O Brother, Where Art Thou"", which comes with a big dose of arty, but it's not overwhelming. Rather, it's accessible, with a fast, intellectual plot, lots of comedy, and lots of wonderful bluegrass music.What a wonderfully original film. And unlike many musicals, where the characters just say, ""Oh, I think I'll break into song now,"" there are real plot reasons for the singing to occur everywhere. If you are familiar with Homer's ""The Odyssey"", there are some in-jokes as well. There are a number of wonderfully clever plot gimmicks, too such as the ending.My only concern would be that bluegrass music is sometimes so religious it's overkill... but that's just the culture and the music is great. I immediately went out to rent some other Coen brothers films, and with the exception of Miller's Crossing wasn't that impressed with the others.Who should see this film:-- EveryoneI'll give this film a 10 out of 10.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
119,policy134,Not the best of an otherwise exceptional Coen resume,4,6 September 2005,"The best Coen films are usually the ones that have extreme quirks like the one and only ""Barton Fink"". Here, however, the muddled storyline is too ordinary or to put it another way, the Coens seem to want some kind of mainstream acceptance that has otherwise not been their goal before. The cast does well in their respective roles but there is something too familiar about the whole set up. Yes, there were a lot of rural dramas in the 30's and 40's but the Coens seem too much in love with these movies to satirize them. That means that it is more of an homage than reinterpretation and that's a shame because they had so good luck with their ode to screwball comedy ""The Hudsucker Proxy."" All the Coens' favorites are here including John Goodman, John Turturro and Holly Hunter but most of the time is wasted on crass southern stereotypes and to make fun of them is acceptable but it's annoying to see it for the umpteenth time. The best thing about this is the tinted photography which gives the film a worn out look that goes great with the rural setting. Otherwise, this can only be described as a failed effort but even low-grade Coen is better than almost every other movie so I have continued to see their movies because which other director/writer/producer team do the U.S. have that are more than just providers of pop corn entertainment.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
120,Horror-yo,Fine Cohens Modern Fairy Tale,7,20 May 2016,"This is one of the rare examples where good story telling and good execution alone are enough without a strong morality at the end or guiding principle. This is ""just"" a well-told Cohens film, therefor special and setting itself apart from other productions of its time in the world of cinema; a modern fairy tale set in the early century deep south, with all sorts of crazy unlikely events, zany adventures, particular characters found along the way and along the miles traveled by the protagonists, miles of fun had by the viewers. This is cinema in its most gratuitous form - a simple experience of taking in the produce from the minds of film-making creators and enjoying it to the fullest, without any exercised effort to determine a particular goal within the plot or deeper meaning of the story. Just good fun, a tale with a beginning and an end, all the while rediscovering the folklore and flavors of that setting.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"

123,bregund,"Starts off well, but erodes into banality",1,11 April 2004,"***SPOILERS HEREIN***This movie starts out as a wonderfully cartoonish, big, brawling, slowpoke of a film.  With his hillbilly mannerisms, wall-eyed expressions, and perfect delivery, George Clooney gains redemption from the dreadful ""Batman and Robin"" and ""Solaris"".  ""I'm the paterfamilias,"" he proclaims when he sees his daughters.  Priceless.This film's defenders are those who find genius in things that are merely different.  For example, watching John Turturro yodel is startling, but then so is watching a homeless man urinate in a bottle; genius lies in context, not in eclecticism.  After listening to the wonderfully original music that permeates the score, the viewer is then treated to an audience singalong of ""You Are My Sunshine"", a song even more loathsome than ""Disco Duck"".The subplot about dueling politicans made no sense and contributed nothing to the storyline, other than as a convenient way to wrap up the ending. Is there any politician in the world who would storm into a crowded music hall and proclaim ""I am a member of a secret society""?  It was a very weak and very lame way of disposing of the subplot villain.  Why would a man who was so careful and crafty with his campaign throw it all away by raising the ire of a roomfull of people?  So stupid, and made no sense.  This is very sloppy writing by the Coens.John Goodman is not a very good actor.  Although he was brilliant as Dan Connor on ""Roseanne"", he just doesn't have the range to play different characters.  He delivers his lines as Dan Connor would; little wonder then that the character is named Big Dan.  Fred Flintstone, Babe Ruth, King Ralph:  he plays the same character time after time, just like Morgan Freeman does.  However, he has a good screen presence, so it's understandable that he's a Coen brothers staple.  Holly Hunter, normally a firecracker, is ice-cold, and it's difficult to understand what Everett sees in her.  John Turturro is, as always, on the edge of mania, ready to fall off the deep end at any moment.  His howl of lust when he sees the women at the river is one of the funniest things he's ever done.  ""Looks like Pete's got the itch,"" Delmar deadpans in his philosophical way.My main problem with this movie is that there is no point to any of it. There is no goal and no storyline.  You can't identify with any of the characters, and it's difficult to accept Everett's longing to be back with his frigid wife.  Villians pop up right and left, but they are just temporary.  This film is like a series of half-finished thoughts, or half-remembered dreams, all leading up to a whole bunch of nothing.  The ending fizzles out like a dying candle, with Everett begging Penny to take him back.  Hmm, we're back where we started.With better writing, this could have been a great film.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
124,DavidSim240183,Another Coen classic!,10,21 March 2007,"The Coen Brothers are among the finest filmmakers in the world. Nearly every one of their films has been a delight in some way. They're just so unique. Bursting with ideas. And they're never less than engaging. And in the case of O Brother, Where Art Thou? they've made their first attempt at rewriting an already preexisting work of fiction, rather than adapted a story from scratch like their previous films. And what a film it is! O Brother may be a slightly disjointed tale, but its filled with so many fascinating characters, absorbing situations and catchy musical numbers that you're hooked.Based (rather loosely) on Homer's Odyssey, the Coens' have taken a stab at reworking the story as a sort of unconventional road trip movie. And its a largely successful attempt. Set in 1937 during the height of the Great Depression in the Mississippi Delta, O Brother follows the adventures of three escaped convicts from a chain gang. The (self) elected leader of the group Ulysses Everett McGill (a surprisingly hilarious George Clooney). Pete (John Turturro). And Delmar (Tim Blake Nelson). One more dimmer than the last.McGill is searching for buried loot he supposedly pillaged from an armoured truck robbery. Since he was chained to Pete and Delmar he had to bring them with him. Promising to cut them in on the stash, they begin an unforgettable adventure across the Deep South, encountering a diverse number of eccentrics, numerous run-ins with the law, finding fame as a singing trio, corrupt governors, the KKK and a race to reconcile McGill with his estranged wife Penny (Holly Hunter) before she remarries.O Brother is a film that pulls us in quite a few different directions. Its a film of many sorts. One minute its a comedy, the next its a musical, some parts serious, and other parts tragic. It even touches upon mystical tones at times. In the hands of another director, O Brother could have emerged as a fragmented mess. But these are the Coen Bros. In all their films, their direction is masterful. And so it is here. They transform O Brother into a wonderfully rich, multilayered experience.One thing that makes O Brother worth the price of admission is the sheer number of bluegrass music, gospel songs and blues numbers that populate the background. They're incredibly catchy, intensely hummable, and seriously memorable. They create an almost magical mysticism at times. Like the scene where McGill & Co encounter modern day Sirens. Three beautiful washerwomen who do nothing except sing. Its an eerie scene because even as they appraise these men, they still keep singing their hypnotic song.Or the scene where they come across a communal Baptism. They're in the woods, when suddenly from out of nowhere people arrive in droves slowly walking to the lake to be baptised. They just keep walking and singing like in a trance. The music infuses these scenes with an almost tangible feeling of magic in the air.But the one song that you have to hear is the one they sing as the Soggy Bottom Boys. They make a side-trip to a radio station just to earn some quick cash. But the song they come up with is an instant hit with people. And its a great song too! You'll be humming it for hours after the film's finished.O Brother is filled with great actors from beginning to end. In fact I can't think of one single bad performance in the entire film. The acting is great all across the board. George Clooney is a revelation as the slick, fast-thinking McGill. He's never been as likable in any other film as he has here. Some of his slack-jawed facial expressions are hilarious. He's an entertaining leader. And Turturro and Nelson are comically endearing as his travelling companions.John Goodman, a Coen regular appears halfway through as a surprisingly scary Bible salesman. I had no idea he could be so convincingly sinister. He at first emerges with his usual jovial personality, but when he crushes a toad with his bare hand, you'll see a side of him you never knew existed.The Coens' trademark black humour crops up from time to time, even if it is a little restrained by their usual standards. In fact O Brother is surprisingly light for a Coen film. Except for one scene that's shocking in its audacity. An encounter with the KKK that turns into a choreographed dance number. Its a stunning scene that simultaneously highlights their evil, and their single minded mentality. It also shows you what the Coens' can get away with too.As things draw to a close, quite a few of the films plot lines converge, involving a crooked election, the trio's last stand against the law, McGill's marriage and some divine intervention.O Brother, Where Art Thou? is among the Coens' best work. The golden cinematography gloriously highlights the film. The different individual vignettes takes us on a marvellously entertaining trip through the Deep South, and the eclectic actors and their performances make the film into a real treat.Unmissable!","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
125,majikstl,"O Brother, Gimme a Break!",3,17 January 2001,"You know a film is in sorry shape when the film makers stage a Klan rally as though it were a half-time show at a football game and still can't make it funny or interesting. The characters in this film are sorry stereotypes (they're from the south, so naturally they are presented as morons; the oracle is, of course, a blind man; the politicians are fat and crooked, etc.). The story wants to ramble, but the direction is sloppy and clumsy. The film's only asset is the music. I am not a Coen brothers fan; I find their work cold, mechanical and lacking simple humanity. That is fine for a stylish film noir like Blood Simple, but cruel, almost sadistic in films like Raising Arizona or Fargo. They are akin to Kubrick (not necessarily a compliment) in that they have neither the desire nor the talent to explore human nature or emotions in anything but the most superficial manner. Thinking about O Brother, I can't help but think that Robert Altman, in his prime, could have made something fascinating and wonderful out of this material. As is, the film is typically Coen, empty and flashy and absolutely forgettable.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
126,david-meldrum,Enduring And Endearing,9,21 November 2020,"Still a pitch-perfect entry in the Coen brothers canon, this recasting of the Odyssey as the tale of three escaped convicts trying to make their way in the world is deft, funny and still surprisingly moving. The choice of setting allows us to truly question what we understand heroism to be, and the carefully timed emergence into the narrative of the KKK also causes us to question what we see as monstrous and what our own role in that may be. It draws on many familiar tropes and reshapes them into a new setting superbly, and the performances remain beautifully judged. An endearing and enduring film.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
127,Majikat76,A Coen classic!,7,28 March 2018,"Much like other Coen Bro's films, it's a love it or hate it, kinda piece.

128,steiner-sam,This is a fun movie,8,2 September 2021,"The film is set in 1937 Mississippi and is a comedic road film. It is loosely based on Homer's ""Odyssey.""Ulysses McGill (George Clooney), Delmar O'Donnell (Tim Blake Nelson), and Pete (John Turturro) are three convicts chained together who escape from the prison road crew. Ulysses tells the others he has $1.2 million buried near his childhood home from an earlier robbery. In addition, the area is about to be flooded by the creation of a dam to generate electricity for the state.The odyssey of the three men leads to encounters with Pete's cousin, Wash Hogwallop, an African American guitarist named Tommy Johnson, a blind bluegrass radio station manager, the bank robber Baby Face Nelson, a one-eyed Bible salesman and con man, a baptismal service in a river where Delmar and Pete are ""saved,"" three women who seduce and drug the men and turn Pete in for the reward, a Ku Klux Klan rally in which Tommy is threatened, and two candidates for governor of the state, including the incumbent.Bluegrass music accompanies the action throughout as we learn that Ulysses is a smooth-talking blowhard that went to prison for impersonating a lawyer. He only wants to get back to his estranged wife and six daughters before she remarries. He is a vain man who uses Dapper Dan pomade to style his hair, though its scent helps the police follow the trio throughout the film.There is much almost slapstick humor throughout as Delmar and Pete are portrayed as hayseeds. The Coen brothers have described the film as the Three Stooges meet Homer.This is a fun movie. Sometimes the flow between episodic events is jerky, and verbal phrases central in one scene disappear to never appear again, e.g., Ulysses repeatedly saying ""We're in a tight spot"" in an early crisis but never again repeats it. Coen Brothers movies are a bit of an acquired taste; you're OK with the required leaps, or you're not.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
129,mdm-11,Depression Era South Nightmare,7,21 May 2005,"Althoug many details are extremely far fetched, this story of rural Mississippi ca. 1935 has many realistic elements reminding of the ""dark side"" of life ""down South"" in the years prior to WWII. George Clooney is convincing as the street-wise and ""worldly"" self-appointed leader of a 3-man team escaping from a chain gang. The trio encounter a series of situations, including a recording-session at a make-shift studio owned by a blind radio station DJ, encounters with a bank robber, a shifty crook posing as Bible salesman, and several near-lynchings. Inbetween scenes we see a rivalry between the incumbent Governor and his radical challenger.Several scenes are powerful testimony to the social injustices of the day. A secret nightly KKK rally is awe-inspiring. To see how an innocent man was to be ""offered up"" due to nothing other than his skin color is a shocking thing to view. Another vivid reminder of ""how things used to be"" is the sadistic prison official, who has a keen interest in ""law enforcement"" (namely lynchings).Several critical moments turned out OK for our heroes, right down to the ""act of God"" towards the end, which gave a satisfying conclusion to the story. I appreciated the many historically correct details, yet the entire story was quite unlikely (as in ""The Green Mile""). It's like getting struck by lightning AND winning the State Lottery both on the same day (and living to enjoy the fortune!).","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
130,Mort-31,"If you don't know Coen, go and watch it!",8,31 December 2000,"For me, being a great admirer of the Coen Brothers' movies, it is hard to rate this movie justly. Let me express it like this: It is better than most other films in this world but as a Coen baby it's only average. I'm afraid the two guys are getting older and losing the density of dialogue they once had in films like Barton Fink` or Miller's Crossing`. Their characters are getting shallower, their point is not in the characters any more, only in the plot and mainly in weird, atmospheric moments, which they still do better than any other American director. They always used fantastic technical effects to the full  photography, music, post-production. But in O Brother` they rely too much on those effects and leave the dialogue behind. In Barton Fink` & Co. you could at least belive that the film has a deep meaning (even if it hadn't). O Brother` is only a comedy  a most entertaining one, however.They haven't made many films. Maybe I'm being unfair, and the next one will be brilliant again, I mean, not ordinary brilliant but Coen-brilliant. I hope so. Come on, Joel & Ethan! Don't sleep!

I groaned through ""Romeo & Juliet"" *both* times I had to read it for school. I thought ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" was ridiculous. And I absolutely loathed ""The Odyssey"" (which I also had to read twice). Fortunately, ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" successfully updates the story and makes it accessible, enjoyable, and an absolute delight.George Clooney is Odysseus (actually, that's Ulysses Everett McGill), trying to get back to his wife Penny (Holly Hunter), who's told their children he got run over by a train. Instead of war, he's been working on a chain gang, and instead of some kind of vengeful force, he now has to elude a sinister Sheriff (and a cyclops bible salesman, played to perfection by John Goodman). I can't begin to spill all the hilarity that happens within this one dreadfully short movie. There's some doozies, believe you me!

134,jackasstrange,"May be not so Coen, but is a great film anyways",8,21 November 2013,"I definitely loved this film. It's just as perfect as a film can get. Some can say that this is not a 'Real' Coen film, but who cares when a film is good as this one? Everything is just flawless. The plot is way lighthearted for a Coen film, it's really the kind of film that follows the arc 'the protagonist suffer,suffer, and in the end he met happiness'. Similar arc with the Odissey of Homer, whose book was used here as the mainly inspiration for the film. Obviously, the name of the protagonist is indeed the same in both O Brother Where Are Thou and in the Odissey: Ulysses.The acting in almost all the Coen's films are phenomenal and over the top, and this repeat itself here in this film. Great job by Turturro and Clooney, which held the lead of the film and did very well. The cinematography by Roger Adkins, and as well the art design, are essential to build the dread and sunset ambient of the south. Really deserved Oscar nomination for it.And how to not talk about the fantastic music in the film? It really left speechless. Music in the film was originally conceived as a major component of the film, not merely as a background or a support. Noted producer and musician T- Bone Burnett worked with the Coens while the script was still in its working phases, and the soundtrack was recorded before filming commenced.The ""Soggy Bottom Boys"" singing ""Man of Constant Sorrow"".Much of the music used in the film is period-specific folk music, including that of Virginia bluegrass singer Ralph Stanley. The musical selection also includes religious music, including Primitive Baptist and traditional African-American gospel, most notably the Fairfield Four, an a cappella quartet with a career extending back to 1921 who appear in the soundtrack and as gravediggers towards the film's end. Selected songs in the film reflect the possible spectrum of musical styles typical of the old culture of the American South gospel, delta blues, country, swing and bluegrass. There is a notable use of dirges and other macabre songs, a theme that often recurs in Appalachian music (""O Death,"" ""Lonesome Valley,"" ""Angel Band,"" ""I Am Weary"") in contrast to bright, cheerful songs (""Keep On the Sunnyside,"" ""In the Highways"") in other parts of the film.The voices of the Soggy Bottom Boys were provided by Dan Tyminski (lead vocal on ""Man of Constant Sorrow""), Nashville songwriter Harley Allen, and the Nashville Bluegrass Band's Pat Enright. The three won a CMA Award for Single of the Year and a Grammy Award for Best Country Collaboration with Vocals, both for the song ""Man of Constant Sorrow."" Tim Blake Nelson sang the lead vocal on ""In the Jailhouse Now"".""Man of Constant Sorrow"" has five variations: two are used in the film, one in the music video, and two in the soundtrack. Two of the variations feature the verses being sung back-to-back, and the other three variations feature additional music between each verse. Though the song received little significant radio airplay, it reached #35 on the U.S. Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart in 2002. The version of ""I'll Fly Away"" heard in the film is performed not by Krauss and Welch (as it is on the CD and concert tour), but by the Kossoy Sisters with Erik Darling accompanying on long-neck 5-string banjo, recorded in 1956 for the album Bowling Green on Tradition Records.Tommy, the lead guitarist of the Soggy Bottom Boys, is an intentional reference to the legend of Delta Blues artist Tommy Johnson, who claimed to have sold his soul to the devil in return for blues fame.So, what you are expecting?

I am not familiar with the Odyssey story at all, but I really enjoyed this nostalgic romp.Clooney is great in this role as Ulysses Everett McGill, a wise cracking, brylcreme addicted personality, who goes on about the state of his affairs with a huge smile and a rambling southern accent.  It was a real treat to watch him in this role.  The cinematography is also quite good, and it had that great 30's nostalgic feel and captured the era perfectly.  I am a big sucker for nostalgia in movies and this film handled it perfectly.  And Turturro is great as always, he's definitely another favourite actor of mine.I suppose being familiar with the original story I would have gotten more out of it, but still it was a fun ride.

The acting was dead-on, the best performance given by Clooney, EVER, South Park cameos notwithstanding.  The visuals and soundtrack were entirely too much fun, and 100% unique to the era that this movie was released into.What else could we expect from the Coen brothers, who have been creating completely original visions since the mid-1980's?  The story is a wonderful spin on Homer's ""The Odyssey,"" and cribs several characters and events from the ancient tale.  If there were any complaint about this film at all, it would be the (few) liberties it takes with the poet's tale, but it still makes for an epic film, the kind of loopiness that was missing from ""The Newton Boys"" (remember that one?), or certain modern day remakes of classic stories.A 10/10 on this one-- sheer mindless, random fun, but still grounded in reality... exactly as Homer would have dictated it.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
137,jldmp1,Home At Last,8,24 June 2006,"When tackling Homer's 'Odyssey' within a modern medium, the question is not only how do you abbreviate it, but what modern underpinnings can you apply? For example, Steely Dan used the blues idiom infused with self-deprecating irony to produce a deceptively simple reinterpretation.Here, the Coens have to rely on movie phrasing to permit audience digestion. Visibly, we have ""Ulisse"", ""I Am A Fugitive.../The Man Who Broke 1000 Chains"" (with Durning as the anchor), ""Sullivan's Travels"", ""Crossroads"", ""Dillinger"", etc.But the key is, all of this is reconstructed on top of the Coens' own ""Raising Arizona"" reimagined as a musical. The combination of real place/surreal events/surreal characters plainly derives from that earlier work. Goodman even replicates his earlier fight scene.And this is better than most musicals, because the musical narrative is not a 'separate reality' imposed on top of the 'movie reality', but seamlessly integrated to serve both the art and the story.A fun little journey.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
138,mhasheider,A real hoot.,8,15 May 2001,"Hilarious and glorious adventure set in Mississippi during the Great Depression about three convicts (Everett - George Clooney, Pete - John Turturro, and Delmar - Tim Blake Nelson) who escape from prison and try to stay a step ahead of their demented pursuers although they're attached to each other in chains and search for a bundle of money that the Clooney character claims to have hid from the authorites.The Coen brothers (Ethan and Joel), who (are now the masters of dark comedy since director Stanley Kubrick passed away) have certainly created another gem in ""O Brother, Where Art Thou"" and the film's story is based on ""The Odyssey"" by Homer and ""Sullivan's Travels"".  There are plenty of bizarre and funny moments in the movie like watching KKK members dance and sing before a hanging (my favorite) and the convicts who run come upon three singing women (sirens) who are washing their clothes in the river.Also, the film's photographer, Roger Deakins, has done a remarkable job here in capturing the scenery and the composer, T-Bone Burnett (Love the name), brings in a lovely mix of country and bluegrass songs.  One of the bands that's appears on the soundtrack - The Soggy Bottom Boys  actually consists of the convicts and a guitar player who sold his soul to the devil for the guitar.The best performances that stand out in the film are given not by Clooney (who's mocking Clark Gable), but by Nelson, who has a few great one-liners and John Goodman, who appears as Big Dan Teague, a slithery and loud one-eyed Bible salesman.""O Brother"" is a real hoot.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
139,Miles-10,work of weird genius,9,8 February 2001,"The Coen brothers have made a mark on the movies since their 1980s debut, ""Blood Simple."" They reached a mass audience with ""Fargo."" Now they have given us another skewed vision with ""O Brother, Where Art Thou."" The question is, a skewed vision of what? Of Homer's Odyssey? Of America's fly-over country? Unless I have missed something in previous Coen movies, while these co-script-writing brothers are obviously literate, this is the first time they have based the plot of a movie on a classic story, but it is not the first time they have told a story set in that vast part of the US which many movie-makers ignore. On the other hand, some residents of fly-over country might prefer to be ignored. The Coens paint America's hinterland with broad and comical strokes. I laughed at the antic characters in this movie, but I winced, too. The Coens make sport of hicks, hayseeds, rubes and hillbillies--the only people it is still politically correct to make fun of. Perhaps this is allowed precisely because such folk are themselves famously politically incorrect, or more to the point, they too often look on political correctness as alien to common sense. (If one becomes genuinely sophisticated as opposed to being a poseur, one realizes that the rubes are often right.) A sense of fair play makes me think that rural folk ought not to be picked on so much. On the other hand, I want to say, ""Yeah, but this is really funny!"" That, of course, would be regarded as a poor defense of any comedy made at the expense of some politically correct sacred cow. That said, ""O Brother Where Art Thou"" is so full of fun that I can hardly wait to see it again. Homer's tale becomes a departure point whereby every cliche about 1930s rural America in general and Mississippi in particular is rendered larger than life. You have chain gangs, ""ole timey"" country music (the way it was before Nashville discovered electric guitars), folksy politicians, new Deal hydro-electric projects, dirt-poor farmers covered with real dirt, women with seven or more children, bank-robbers who drive fast cars while wielding tommy guns, and even the Ku Klux Klan. If you don't appreciate this movie, you should check out some of the fare on American Movie Classics. The Coens are making loving fun of the style of 1930s movies, complete with a performance from George Clooney that often parodies '30s mega-star Clark Gable.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
140,The_Wood,3/10 Bring a drool cup,3,23 January 2002,"The Coen Bros. are usually the most obscurely directors working today.  I say usually, because with O Brother, Where Art Thou? they went from perfecting the obscure, to dwelling in idiocy.  The film might be gorgeous to look at, but underneath the lush cinematography is a pin headed script, with dreadful performances.Many admire the film because they love the blue grass barnyard yokel music, but I have never been one to reside in the the South, so I didn't buy it.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
141,marcus_stokes2000,Odyssey in the South of USA,9,30 October 2006,"*O SPOILERS, Where Art Thou?* Three chained inmates, the loquacious and a little vain Everett Ulysses McGill (George Clooney), the child-like and easily foolable Delmar (Tim Blake Nelson) and the temperamental Pete (John Turturro) embark in a spectacular journey after a great treasure; or at least, that's what Everett assures them of.They'll find a treasure, but like a blind man predicts to them, 'it's not the one they're looking for', and manage to become Country stars on the way.This is one of the funniest retelling of Homer's 'The Odyssey' I have ever seen; the atmosphere of the '20s is really palpable here, and everybody does a great job with what they have to work with.We also find out that yes, there *is* one thing George Clooney can't do - singing. In fact, he seems to have been so bad he had to be dubbed by a professional singer, especially playing a lead singer in the film.Anyway, minor quibble. Watch this movie and have a lot of fun, Coen style! O Brother, Where Art Thou?: 9/10.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
142,moviewiz-4,O what a wonderful movie.,7,17 May 2001,"I think this one is not as good as the previous Mr Coen's movie. The plot is ok but what i find out this movie did not have any interesting part at the first half an hour. What i believe is good from this script is the musical, how great that Mr Clooney can sings in his part, simply too good.Beside that, i found something very different. The colour of the movie change sometimes near the end. Maybe the projector is not good or the movie is create to be like that.One more to comment, it seems that the camera has too many close-up. All the things that appear on the screen looks very big even-though i sit right at the back.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
143,noahgibbobaker,Uninteresting.,5,10 February 2021,"This is the first Coen brothers film I haven't really liked. Like all of they're other work ""O brother, where art thou?"" is great from a technical standpoint, but I don't connect with the characters or story in any way.Almost the only enjoyment I got out of this film was from the music. I quite like this era of American music and I have a personal connection to ""you are my sunshine"" by Norman Blake.
The other elements I like are the lighting, camerawork (Roger Deakins) and all the Tommy Johnson stuff. I also think the performances are good, even though I don't like what our main three cast members were going for.A huge issue this movie encounters is the length, the runtime of a film doesn't bother me unless it feels unjust, the runtime of ""O brother, where art thou?"" feels unjustified. The story is bland, conventional and predictable, the storytelling isn't interesting, the characters don't interest me and there aren't enough funny moments to warrant the hour forty minute length.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"

George Clooney and two other guys give wonderful performances as jailmates who break free and are on the run.  This movie has very brilliant direction.  If George Clooney and the other guys would've at least been nominated for an Academy Award, I would've been much happier. This is a true gem of a movie.Overall the entire movie is excellent and the whole John Goodman's end was awesome.  Rating 10 out of 10.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
145,tnrcooper,Entertaining and interesting take on the South,10,11 July 2006,"This 2000 film from the Coen brothers, Ethan and Joel, features the adventures of three southern men criss-crossing the South and encountering different Southern legends and famous features. The adventurers consist of two rather slow, if likable men, Delmar and Pete, (Tim Blake Nelson and John Turturro, both fantastic in signifying slow reaction times) and a smooth-talking would-be renaissance man, Everett (George Clooney, playing a role which the smooth Clooney imbues his character with naïve short-sightedness typical of many would-be smooth-talkers) cross the south, encountering many archetypes and legends of the area as they go. Joel and Ethan Coen have done a fantastic job of linking many tales of the South and connecting the characters to this voyage by taking as their framework, Homer's The Odyssey in which the characters had adventures all occurred within one day. The film opens with the main characters working on the chain gang and seeming northerner (and coincidentally the schemer?) Clooney concocting a scheme whereby he and some other men can escape and thereby return to his wife (the versatile Holly Hunter, playing Penny, Everett's tough but exasperated estranged wife) before she re-marries. They cross The mythical Crossroads, the site supposedly where guitarist Robert Johnson sold his soul to the devil in exchange for amazing guitar-playing abilities where they pick up a man obviously envisioned as a stand- in for Johnson, Tommy Johnson (Chris Thomas King), and with him they perform ""black music"" for a blind record producer to whom they tell they tell some sly and very funny lies. Pete and Delmar are baptized and re-born while would-be renaissance man Everett mocks their sudden reverence for what he regards as foolish superstition. They encounter a particularly psychotic religious huckster in Big Dan Teague (a fantastic John Goodman). The Klan is also lampooned hilariously and savagely. Some have critiqued this film for being less than the sum of its parts but I think that this criticism misses the mark. Although the settings might be distinct, the use of The Odyssey to tie these sites together seems to me to provide enough structure to give the film a narrative coherence. And to be honest, even were the narrative of The Odyssey not used, I believe that the examination of many Southern features also provides the film with a thematic constancy. And even were that not so, I believe that the notion that the film is too varied in tone is not really a legitimate criticism. I don't see that there is a lot of criticism of many big Hollywood films which are narratively incoherent, let alone consistent in tone and I believe that the variety of concerns which Coen address make for an interesting and rich film tapestry.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
146,MovieGuy109,Coen brother quirks,8,8 October 2011,"The Coen Brothers follow up their two last crime black comedies with a more light-hearted piece. The risk pays off. The film is silly and full of eccentric characters. The film is also more period oriented than any other Coen film. It is full of convincing sets and a good amount of extras. Roger Deakins' fantastic cinematography is a highlight, using color lenses for dramatic and comedic effect was one of the smartest decisions the Coens made with this one. Clooney, along with his two co-stars dominate every scene, even when the dialogue is a bit on the uncredible side. Still a knock-out though, with lots of laughs and always entertainment value.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
147,Indy-52,"boring, unfunny",4,16 June 2001,"I was really ready to enjoy this movie. After reading some very positive reviews for it and hearing it was weird and funny I decided to rent it. It had competition from the likes of Space Cowboys, Meet the Parents, Crouching Tiger, and Nurse Betty (all of which I could've rented) but I felt confident somehow this movie was going to be worth my money. But it was quite a mistake I made. Although this movie looked beautiful, it was boring and often made no sense. I didn't laugh once. It was definitely weird and unusual, but not worth the money to see. It was completely pointless. Maybe I just didn't ""get"" it. Perhaps you'll like it; I guess it's a ""love it or hate it"" kind of movie. Thank you for reading this review.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
148,Brogan,Joel & Ethan's Odyssey.,10,18 January 2001,"There are two sides to film directors Joel & Ethan Coen.  There is the dark and suspenseful side which they showed in BLOOD SIMPLE and FARGO. Then there is the goofy and wacky side displayed in RAISING ARIZONA and HUDSUCKER PROXY.  With thier new film, O BROTHER WHERE ART THOU? the Coen Brothers use the wacky and silly road in telling a modern version of Homer's classic poem, 'The Odyssey.'  And the Coen's use their trademarks throughout this film, from the comical and amazing stunts to John Turturro. Ulysses Everett McGill (George Clooney) is a prisoner in the state of Mississippi during depression 1930's.  Ulysses is a man who takes good care of his hair with 'Dapper Dan' hair grease and wearing hair nets while sleeping, and has a rather unusual intellect for a prisoner in the 1930's. Ulysses decides to break free from work detail one day bringing along his two chainmates, Pete (John Turturro) and Delmar (Tim Blake Nelson).  Where Ulysses is smart, Pete is arrogant, and Delmar is not too bright.  Ulysses convinces his mates to escape from prison to seek the pile of gold that Ulysses hid before getting sent to jail. They first run into a blind prophet on a handcart who predicts that the three men will be going on a great journey on their way back home. While on their way back to Ulysses' homestead, they have the same encounters that the character of Ulysses encountered in 'The Odyssey.' Like 'Odyssey' Ulysses, Pete, and Delmar encounter Sirens, a criminal being George ""Babyface"" Nelson, a godess turning one of them into a frog, Zeus (as Governor Pappy O' Daniel), Cyclops (Big Dan Teague), suitors, and even Charybdis.  All of these enconters led for Ulysses to see his soon to be ex-wife Penny (Holly Hunter) before she marries a crooked suitor and taking their seven daughters with her. The very enjoyable thing about O BROTHER WHERE ART THOU? is comparing this film to The Odyssey.  Having been ""force read"" Odyssey in high school, I understood the ""inside jokes"" that Joel and Ethan Coen put into this film for the modern telling of the thousands of years old poem. If Hollywood filmmakers like Baz Lurhman can do modern version of William Shakespeare's ROMEO & JULLIET, then why can't the Coen's do Odyssey?I also did enjoy the acting in this film.  George Clooney proves that he is not only a cool actor, but also funny and good!  He makes Ulysses a character what Pete calls, ""a big mouth smart aleck.""  Ulysses is a man who doesn't believe in faith, but believes in coindences and luck instead. While Pete and Delmar who Ulysses calls, ""dumber than a bag of hammers,"" do believe in faith and superstition, which makes Ulysses either egotistical or intelligent or perhaps both. And Tim Blake Nelson is also very enjoyable as the not too bright Delmar who is usually in the middle of the arguments between Ulysses and Pete, and who does believe in old fashion superstition.  And the other actors, from John Turturro, Charles Durning, John Goodman, Holly Hunter, and Michael Badalucco all deliver good performances as well. But two things stand out with O BROTHER, first is the bluegrass music, it's outstanding!  There are lots of classic songs that are depression era time that is played on the soundtrack of the film.  But the modern written ""Man of Constant Sorrow"" which is sung by Ulysses, Pete and Delmar as the ""Soggy Bottom Boys"" is the best song that will have you humming as you leave the theater.  And the directing by Joel Coen is also very well done, with great pacing, some very amusing scenes, and wacky characters makes O BROTHER a splendid comedy. In the Year in Review 2000 issue of Entertainment Weekly, film critic Owen Gilbertman said that O BROTHER was the ""Worst Movie of 2000.""  The worst?  More worse than other terrible movies with the likes of READY TO RUMBLE, BIG MOMMA'S HOUSE, SUPERNOVA, NEXT BEST THING, and the dreaded BATTLEFIELD EARTH?  I think Mr. Gilbertman either had obnoxious people sitting next to him, or had a bad hangover from a party the night before while watching O BROTHER at the Cannes Film Festival.  How could this very enjoyable and wacky film be bad?  Yet he give a movie like CHARLIE'S ANGELS a ""B"" for being trashy, yet fun?  At least film critic Roger Ebert gave O BROTHER another chance before giving a final review, to saying that some scenes were good, but not good enough to recommend.  I think Mr. Gilbertman should pick up a copy of 'The Odyssey' and realize the similarites between the film pieces of art. But there are still plenty of big and small named critics who praise O BROTHER, and it's even nominated for Best Picture (Comedy/Musical) for Golden Globes.  And after watching this movie I can see why.  It's the Coen's doing their Dr. Jekyl filmmaking, the lightweight fun and goofy side of a story.  But some critics and Coen fans prefer the Mr. Hyde vision of the Coens, with dark and moody.  But whether you enjoy wacky films or just the Coens in general (like me) then O BROTHER will please you a great deal, with you humming the songs from the soundtrack on the way home.  ***** (out of five)","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
149,Ziya90,A painful memory,1,30 December 2009,"I think that Coen Brothers are two of the greatest directors of all time, they are two of my favorite directors too. Art, entertainment and cinema feeling, most of their movies I have seen include all. People under-appreciated their last movie, No Country for Old Men and some people even hated it and say very overrated. To me the best Coen movies are Barton Fink and No Country for Old Men. However, O Brother where art Thou was not art, was not enjoyable and extremely insipid (lack of cinema feeling?) Besides, Coen Brothers make black comedies, there is black humor in their movies, except for Raising Arizona (it might be seen as black comedy too), but many people say that this movie is a definite comedy, it is very funny, full of laughs. There are a few possibilities. These people may be the people who have never watched any Peter Sellers film, Robin Williams film or Bill Murray film, these people may have a very different comedy conception or these people were cheerful at that time. Because, there was not even one moment I laughed or found funny in the movie. However, this is not important, it was one of the worst movies I have ever seen, because it was not entertaining, it was not stylish (not art) and cinematically tasteless. Is there anything makes person flabbergasted, astonished? The only thing interesting was Red Kit reference. It is an uninspiring adventure of three men. The series of uninteresting events. I wish I did not write this review, because I have remembered the day I watched the movie.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
150,ThomasColquith,Not my cup of tea,3,4 June 2021,"""O Brother"" is certainly a unique film which boldly tries to do something, but just what that something is, is not clear. While I liked other films of this sort such as ""The Big Lebowski"" and ""Big Fish"", ""O Brother"" just did not work for me in the same way. The stilted characters and dialog bugged me, as did the washed out colors on the screen. And while I like some folk music, the score got repetitive and monotonic. Also, the film would have been better without that long Klan scene, had to fast forward. So, 3.0/10.0, not a film I'd recommend, but everyone has different tastes.Though I am still debating whether this film is rife with symbolism, metaphor, and meaning, or if it just has the superficial appearance of depth. I suppose the three escaped men could be dead and lost souls stuck in purgatory. As Clooney's wife repeatedly states that he was hit by a train, and so he could be dead, but he was killed by God for being deceitful for practicing law without a license. And the Bible salesmen who hits them over the head is like a preacher who hits congregants over the head with the word of God, but is really in it for their money. He has one eye, implying partial insight into the spiritual realm. And the themes about repentance and baptism are obvious. But even still, the stereotypes, flat characters, racial insensitivity, and dullness of this film are problematic.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
151,pinkliz41,More fun than a dozen movies put together!,10,2 July 2008,"O brother where art thou is a funny, exciting, at times emotional and all out comedy adventure of three escaped convicts in search of treasure, whilst being pursued by lawmen. It is tightly based on Homers The Odyssey and takes place in the deep south during the 1930's. George Clooney plays Everett, a man of big ideas but no real sense. John Turtorro plays Pete and Tim Black Nelson plays Delmar.Why i say this is an instant classic is the adventure comedy aspect. Both pay of tremendously well all throughout the film. I cant think of any other bunch of talented actors who could up-hold the funniness like Clooney, Turtorro and Nelson could.All in all a timeless and epic achievement that one could be happy enough to watch over and over.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"

153,aramo1,and the music is good too,8,20 January 2002,"Based on R2 DVD 103 minThough not a fan of comedy [Python excluded] this movie was a joy to watch. The Coen brothers must hand pick actors for roles as all the actors seem perfect for the parts they play. Clooney {Gable look alike or what?) deserves a special mention, he is proving to be a very versatile actor.The gags are low key but there are plenty of them, the KKK gathering is a hoot and the music is; like the movie; surprisingly good.7/10 well worth watching","O Brother, Where Art Thou"

In this sometimes weird and uneasy trip, they find a saucy Governor (Durning), a thief (Goodman) and even Baby Face Nelson, the famous gangster. Joel e Ethan Coen try to built an ironic portrait of American society, mainly the communities of Mississipi and Kentucky in the thirties but fails in this attempt.

In my opinion this movie definitely deserved an Oscar nomination for the best picture. People may have different idea about the movie, especially those who are not familiar with American culture. But I liked it a lot, regardless of some jokes that I didn't get.It is said that the movie is loosely based on the epic poem ""Odyssey"" by Homer, which I didn't believe in the first place. But after some moment, the movie become more and more convincing and disturbingly ironic. It really took me some time to realize that it's a political satire rather than some cheap comedy.The story begins with 3 prisoners escaped from a grave-digging field, and tried to escape to one's cousin's home. Later on, more and more irony happened like snowball running off the mountain. For 10 dollars they sang a DIY folk song along with a blue singer who supposedly sold his soul to the ""Devil"" or whatever. And they hoorayed at the 10 dollars they made, knowing little about their future in the music career....The story, which has so much to tell, virtually involved so many recognizable historical moments in US. From the great depression to the KKK. In the eyes of the 3 prisoners, all the people around are crazy as hell, just like the messages they try to communicate in the epic poems.Besides, George Clooney again played a likable character.9/10","O Brother, Where Art Thou"

I found it to be quite dull. The acting was ok. George Clooney was miscast though, in my opinion. The other two fugitives were good though. Holly Hunter was fine. John Goodman was good, as he is in most of the Cohen Brothers movies.
The writing is fine, it has some good lines but its flat compared to the likes of Fargo. The direction is fine. What really shines is the beautiful Cinematography. Thats one nomination the movie did deserve.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"

Everett, Delmar and Pete end up looking for a treasure which is buried by Everett's cabin. Along the way, the three encounter many obstacles such as: sirens, bible salesmen, horse-eating family members and a cow on a cotton roof. (Which really isn't an obstacle) This movie is pretty unique and funny at the same time. The story and music may be a bit unoriginal, but the jokes certainly are. They aren't slapstick or complete randomness, but a bit clever, and silly at the same time.Filled with jokes and tons of bluegrass music, there is some more appeal added into the movie. Though, some of the movie really depends on your sense of humor and taste in music, it is a great film, nonetheless.

Ethan and Joel Coen, brothers born in Minnesota and film educated at NYU is arguably the most original filmmaking team in US film history to date. Known best for FARGO fame, they first cracked Hollywood with BLOOD SIMPLE and except for FARGO, almost faded away with sputtering levels of fruition after their first outing. In this film, a borderline musical about three escaped chain-gang convicts, they come back with a vengeance. 	The cast, headed by a surprisingly new character rendering by George Clooney, story and direction, editing and production values are totally engaged here.  This is worth a rental for almost anyone who has a sense of humor and most decidedly a value if only for the hysterically bizarre Ku Klux Klan sequences.

All set in the Deep South during the Depression, and all surrounded by some terrific folk music.I thought this movie was a lot of fun. The plot is goofy, the characters are goofier, the situations are quite ridiculous but that's the point. It's the Coen brothers!

It has a realistic depiction with a touch of fantasy to it, one that will really skew into some goofy scenes. It's a film that plays with your suspension of disbelief for a little, but stays focused nonetheless. The cast was well picked out, with George Clooney and John Turturro as the lead, as well as Tim Blake Nelson, all of which do an amazing job. The tone is one of the best parts of the movie. It should be a drama, given the source material and the setting, but it plays off as a light comedy, with several over the top scenes that set up for an excellent music score. The songs in this had me humming for days, T Bone Burnett really did a good job in capturing the tone and time period for the film, and it pays off.The film at times feels a little clustered, with some big stars that don't get as much screen time. Holly Hunter is pretty top billed, but isn't around until three fourths of the movie. The film is adapting itself into The Odyssey, so there are some appropriately added scenes that are there to be symbolism, and even though it's well done, it kind of slows down the adventurous pace. With that, the fantasy element of this film is strong, I feel like anything can happen in this movie, and that anything is possible, a free feeling I don't get in movies very often.Not one of my favorite Coen's, but entertaining nonetheless, with some great characters, interesting storytelling, and a fun tone and excellent music.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
164,calspers,Joel Cohen's side step,6,20 October 2019,"""Oh Brother, Where Art Thou"" (2000) directed by Joel Coen is visually stunning and boasts an intrestingly realised soundtrack, but ultimately suffers from general flaws and an unnatural script.From the opening credits, the film is clothed in style and colour. Apart from the brilliant cinematography shot by Roger Deakins (in a first for all-digital post-processing), I felt the film lacked in story, direction, and most profoundly, realistic dialogue from the actors, particularly Clooney.Overall, though, I consider it a decent film by general standards, but not by Coen's usual levels - especially when compared to the masterpiece that he and Ethan created just two years befote - this is by no means among his finest work in my opinion.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"

I've never seen a film by the Coen brothers I didn't like; a few of their films rank among my all-time favs. So my expectations were sky-high and even so I came out thrilled, surprised, and more than satisfied. This story is a wonderful homage to the Homeric epic, but crafted so nicely that even one who has no knowledge of the Odyssey will still love the film! (One or two scenes might be slightly confusing...the Baptism scene and the Sirens for example, but not enough to ruin the film for anyone). The cinematography was *wow* good! Gorgeous scenes, gorgeous sets, just plain gorgeous. And the film was marvelously acted, Clooney was a stand-out, his best performance ever (even topping the Peacemaker, and he was brilliant in that!). And Coen regulars John Turturro and John Goodman were fabulous as always! Allusions were everywhere, not just to Homer, but to Robert Johnson and Babyface (the bank robber, not the producer;), among others. The script was masterful, a perfect combination of epic flavour and modern story. This film is a keeper! Hilarious, well-written, well-crafted, beautifully shot...it proves that you don't need a 100 million dollar budget for special effects to make a quality film. This is right alongside Traffic and Crouching Tiger as the best films of the year! The only reason I don't give it a perfect ten is that it runs just a little long.

And that's how half joke, half serious the movie introduces us in a endless plateau of ridiculous characters, fake obsessions and clowny language. And three friends in the Search of a treasure will find how the treasure itself is the hunt for it.Visually striking, meaningful, great acting. I hope I can find, o brother, such a quality film like these with such a sense of poetry again.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
168,allar100,Coen brothers keep it coming,9,28 February 2003,"Have the Coen brothers ever made a bad film??  I mean really, they always have topnotch acting, their writing is always excellent, the direction, cinematography, and editing is always superb.  O Brother Where Art Thou gets even better when you see what they did to get the get that great dust bowl era look. Full of quirky characters, as in all of their film, this movie gets better and better with each viewing.  Excellent music, and well thought out story adaptation have me giving this one a 9/10.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
169,hbs,another excellent Coen Brothers' movie,9,17 August 2001,"This is a sweet, wacky movie with a feel not unlike ""The Big Lebowski"". I skipped it in theaters because of Clooney, but I regret that now. His performance is, I think, even better than his work in ""Out of Sight"", and completely free of the mannerisms that he used in ER (something I was beginning to find quite irritating). The plot is loosely based on the Coen brother's misconception of the Odyssey (a book they acknowledged they had not read before making the movie), but it is a harmless conceit. The look is somewhat artificial, due to the digital post-processing of the film, but I found that this enhanced the feel of the movie. And I liked the songs...","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
170,benjyboom,Pros and cons,7,21 November 2019,"Pros:
Decent main trio and great side characters, people can walk in and make scenes enjoyable for a few minutes
Good acting, so many character moments are punctuated by a small gesture or action
Excellent soundtrack, moments where the background switches to characters singing and vice versa were cool
Good set design and use of extrasCons:
Plot points being random or random for the sake of variety was unwelcome sometimes
The two crooks who weren't George Clooney didnt get a lot of good lines or scenesBest part: the adventure before meeting the wife was all fun, so the sirens or the cyclops scenes were the standout fun bits
Worst part: stopping the KKK leader through the power of music, a touch cheesy and out of character for the speakeasy politician to act a fool in public","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
171,kekca,My rating: 8,8,13 August 2013,"It is likely that most often I will write reviews about the movies of Coen brothers. In a movie showing from well known to painfully well known themes, they succeeded to show their Coenism. As a perfect cinema culinary, the brothers powdered the main dish with the flavor of the collision of science and religion, the ignorance and faith, destiny and the personal choice. And in a what way! In moments grotesque, ironic and satiric, with the wonderful play of George Clooney, the main characters, like Odysseus and the Bremen musicians, led on the story line of Candid of Voltaire, are involved in adventure.On the background of the individual lamentations for wealth and power, the heroic ensemble is being caught in the trap of the state laws and God's will. Who is authorized to judge? The providence attach to them colorful adherents which draw them into the stream of their personality acts. For final, the garnish is bittersweet and hard-baked.Love. The woman of the main hero appear and she is capable of everything. It seem like it is written for them to be together, until she counts to three. The eternal motor is being found and the motive of the history is not reason. There is only one explanation.It will be good if there were more of these movies. The sight which Coen brothers have is unique and can be put to a row of similar themes and plots. We hope there will be more of their movies but until we hope – watch this one.http://vihrenmitevmovies.blogspot.com/","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
172,datautisticgamer-74853,An odyssey? I'm in,8,11 June 2016,"O Brother, Where Art Thou? offers some very interesting mixes of comedy and drama that overall makes it a very successful adaptation of the Odyssey. I watched this film late at night, so I was awake for most of the first act, sort of like April and the Extraordinary World. The film managed to wake me up with its action, though, and I was wide awake for the rest of it, laughing pretty hard at some of the jokes and getting captivated by the sense of mystery in certain scenes. The cinematography is very well done, portraying the southern US (or what it seems like) very well despite some areas where the color schemes of the set seem monochrome. The Odyssey is technically the story (just replace the characters) and finds an ideal balance between following the Odyssey and adding its own concepts (like the Soggy Bottom Boys). The characters were excellently cast and portrayed their counterparts in the Odyssey with both a sense of sticking to the source material and being progressive. Most of the songs are catchy to listen to, even if they don't enhance the tone of the movie or have dull parts. It's one film that you would want to consider viewing.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
173,Ron Plasma,Oh boy!,8,28 February 2001,"Then came the Coen brothers!  The trailer-hobo-trailer had whetted my appetite even before I had spotted the Ethan and Joel rubber stamp of excellence.  But then came the film itself.  O Brother is such a wonderful film.  Beautifully, beautifully shot.  Fabulous acting from George Clooney - yes that George Clooney, and John Turturro; and John Goodman.  And Michael Badaluuco.  And Tim Blake Nelson. A fabulous script.  Magnificent references to Homer; to Johnson; to Southern politics, (and this praise from someone who thinks that the South starts at Stoke).  Were I not laughing so much throughout O Brother my jaw would have dropped to the level of Delmar's at the sheer perfection of this film.Ron (Viewed 21Sep00)PS More clues to those of you trying to piece together my biography through these reviews - my ex father-in-law claimed to be related to Baby Face Nelson through Shetland origins.

174,Derek237,A great musical comedy,9,16 March 2003,"One thing that makes O Brother, Where Art Thou stand out is its incredible soundtrack. It's probably one of the most popular soundtracks since Saturday Night Fever. ""Man of Constant Sorrow"" is one particular song that sticks in your head. Other than the great music, there are many funny scenes and all the characters are very likable. O Brother is loosely based on Homer's Oddysey, but I thought they didn't need that to tie in with the story. 3 convicts on the run from the law is good enough. That would be my only complaint about it. Some people are always complaining how unrealistic George Clooney's perfectly straight and white teeth are. But really....who cares?All in all, this is one damn entertaining movie. George Clooney (in his Golden Globe winning performance) proves just how great an actor he is.My rating: 9/10","O Brother, Where Art Thou"

176,Chrissie,Grows on you,8,9 November 2001,"I had no inkling this film existed until I saw a poster for it outside a theater. I was killing time waiting for a friend, so I decided that I could look at George Clooney for an hour and a half.I was expecting a goofy jailbreak movie. I didn't realize this was art film. But art flic is was, and I left the theater weirded out but strangely intrigued.Ulysses Everett McGill is a smooth-talking fop of a prisoner who convinces two buddies to make a break with him. Their goal: to retrieve the loot from McGill's armored-car heist before it's left at the bottom of a brand-new lake. The misadventures loosely follow Homer's ""Odyssey"" in a lush visual and musical landscape. To say more would, I think, diminish the magic of just letting it all unfold before you.I bought the soundtrack -- a must, since I couldn't get the music out of my head. I rented OBWOT a few times. I can't get George Clooney lip-synching ""Man of Constant Sorrow"" out of my mind.When I spot OBWOT for sale, I'm adding it to my collection. This one is destined to become a classic.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
177,smashattack,I guess it's an acquired humor.,3,25 February 2002,"Frankly, I don't see how this movie has been given such a high rating on IMDb.  Maybe the people who have voted need to really watch it again and pay really close attention.Especially to the lack of a plot and storyline.Sure, the movie has a ton of subplots, which could be a good thing.  I'll give it that much.  However, the subplots lead nowhere and don't add up to anything.  The main plot is just as shallow, as only parts of it are revealed, hidden within the different and, to put it nicely, ""unique"" characters.The characters are shallow and flat.  You know nothing about them except that they have run away (or R-U-N-O-F-T) from their prison.Conflict.  Every movie and book has one.  Every great story has a conflict that leads up to a climax and resolution.  However, O Brother, Where Art Thou? lacks this trait and tends to rely on subplots, such as the Sirens and the Ku Klux Klan rather than staying with its central plot.  This gets really annoying twenty minutes within the film, when the viewer is left behind just like the three escaped convicts were left behind the train.The movie is classified as comedy.  I found nothing funny about dragging people through a tedious, dim-witted movie without even living up to its own genre.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"

179,MrVibrating,Wonderfully odd comedy!,10,18 November 2006,"Coen movies are easy to spot. They have that feel, the feel of originality and oddity, the crazy story lines and characters. Oh Brother has all that. The toned down dustiness of the movie feels less like a gimmick and more like it's supposed to be there, adding to the already thick Southern filter the movie's viewed through.The storyline is imaginative and totally impossible to predict. Giving credit to Homer is a bit silly, since the references to the Oddessy are made for fun and could easily have been discarded without changing the story.Characters are the usual bunch of misfits and crazies you expect. George Clooney does the role of his life-time. Remember the usual, smug, to a varying degree annoying Clooney you see in every movie he's in? Forget him. This is another person. His two companions are good support and fodder for his clever remarks and half-baked plans.Since this is set in the 30's South, there are tons of things to use as comedic elements. KKK, crooked politicians, religion, rednecks... amplify that with Coen's script-writing talent and you will laugh. A lot. There is even one of the trademark hallucination scenes, kind of.What more can you say than: ""Thank you Coens!"" I wont tell you to enjoy this movie. It's very simple. Just watch it!","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
180,shaid,Funny but pointless,8,15 January 2001,"I'll say right away.I like the Coen brothers. I find them to be truly originals. They try to show that there are more to films than cliches and in every film they show that what concern the technicality they are superb and this is no difference. Technically speaking they are superb. However it seems that in this film they some how neglected the story. The basis for the story is Homer's Odyssey but you won't miss anything if you have never read it because it's the characters from the Odyssey that the film is full with and nothing more.Further more the films is full with characters who come in to the film and disappear after a few minutes only to re-appear in a later stage,with no explanations to their motives or a better insight to their characters,which were one dimension. I also had  a feeling that the whole story was formed as a meaning to serve for the music numbers and that made the film a little bit pointless though I like music and musicals I found it here to be ill serving the movie.But in a strange way I rather enjoyed the film, and I wasn't bored from it and in order to enjoy this film you have to be a real fan of the Coen brothers.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"

I was shattered during the screening, and left the cinema in a state of shock. It would be easy to blame Clooney as he ruins every movie, but this was a deeper problem. It failed in so many areas, especially the script.Perhaps the only ray of light was John Goodman, who continually impresses me with his acting. I'm prepared to give the Coen's more chances because of the awesome material they have produced in the past, but this will scar me for a while.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"

Bone Burnett, who should be nominated for a special consideration for the music.

The Coen Bros. can always be depended upon to deliver memorable personalities, even for characters with less than a minute of screen time.Clooney was the only real problem, for me. His perfect Hollywood face, dirty as it was, still seemed out-of-place among the 'real people' cast. He delivered a much better performance than I was expecting of him, though. He just stuck out from the rest of the actors. Maybe that was the point in casting him; I don't know.Doesn't hurt that I also loved the music (no, that's NOT grammatically correct. I know).

190,Wulfstan10,Superbly Entertaining,9,8 March 2005,"This is absolutely one of the most fun and entertaining films I have ever seen, easily ranking up there with the Adventures of Baron Munchausen.Somewhat like Terry Gilliam and his cohorts, the Coen brothers have a knack for creating a wacky story with colorful, odd-ball characters and odd events in a surreal manner that is utterly compelling and convincing. They achieved all of that in this film, providing a surreal and very fun take on a stereotypical movie-land version of the South combined with many ideas and characters certainly based on the Odyssey and Aeneid. Although they supposedly claimed never to have ""read"" the Odyssey, and some have criticized this film as incorrectly claiming to be inspired by the Odyssey, it is quite clear that that inspiration is there. Numerous characters and events are clearly taken from the myths of Odysseus (and, in fact, Aeneas), but they are simply dressed up in a wacky Southern guise. The events may not happen ""exactly"" as they did in the Odyssey, etc., but that is irrelevant. The fact remains that the parallels are undeniably there and that everything in the film works beautifully. The cinematography, visuals in general, soundtrack, and the acting are all excellent. The result is, in my book, certainly one of the Coen brothers' best achievements, although not quite the equal of The Hudsucker Proxy, which is simply incredible. It is possibly their most fun move ever.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
191,tonyhic,Weak and Witless,3,20 February 2001,"On seeing the shorts to this film, I decided against it because it seemed very annoying, especially George Clooney's exaggerated facial expressions. However, a friend told, me that if I liked Fargo (which I loved), I'd also like this one. Since then, I've significantly reevaluated my judgment of this friend's taste. It was just as annoying as the shorts suggested. For quite a while, I was waiting for the story to turn around and improve, but it was a long, uninteresting story that finished too late. The characters were unlikeable and the jokes were painfully obvious. I've seen more sophisticated plots and humour in most Dukes of Hazard episodes.The only redeeming features were beautiful scenery and some nice music, but surely we have a right to expect a bit more of a movie than that.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
192,segacs,"Funny, but don't expect it to be typical",6,5 February 2005,"The Coen Brothers are weird.If you take this as a known going into the movie, it will certainly help you know what to expect. That is, expect the unexpected.O Brother, Where Art Thou? is a tale about three escaped convicts who are racing against time to get to a treasure. On the way, they encounter all sorts of colourful characters and do all sorts of interesting things. It is loosely based on The Odyssey, but since I've never actually read The Odyssey it would be difficult for me to draw parallels.Parodies of everyone from Robert Johnson to the Carter Family show up at some point. There are hillbilly rednecks, a political election, a blind prophet, religious fanatics, some hooded KKK members, and a bunch of pyromaniacs with a penchant for killing.Somehow in this hodgepodge, a plot (and I use the term loosely) gets strung together. However, this movie isn't about the plot, nor is it about the acting, even despite George Clooney's golden globe award. Each time his accent slipped I questioned how well he deserved that one. But none of that was the point. The bottom line is, this movie is very, very funny.Of course, being able to pick out some of the references helps. I admit that I probably missed most of them, since many were very obscure, but there was still enough humour in there to entertain almost anyone.Just don't go into the movie expecting something typical, because O Brother, Where Art Thou? is anything but.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"

Thy meet Cyclops and sirens like Odyssey or at least a weird more modernized version of it. Well, it's actually set in the 30's. George Clooney, John Turturro and John Goodman (who represents the Cyclops in Odyssey) are great in it as well as Holly Hunter who walks around say her new beau ""is Bonafied"".

In ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"", three escaped convicts (George Clooney, Tim Blake Nelson, John Turturro) leave the chain gang in search of treasure and of home, encountering an ""odyssey"" of strange adventures as they amble through the Depression-Era South. John Turturro Tim Blake Nelson do a wonderful job of playing affable dimwits, and Clooney puts in a top-notch performance as a flim-flam artist who's about as dumb as his two fellow escapees . . . he just knows more high-falutin' words that make him sound smart.  The other cast members are equally impressive -- Charles Durning, John Goodman, and Michael Badaluco all put in some stunning performances as well.Like most Joel and Ethan Coen movies, the story is both bizarre and highly entertaining, with some memorable one-liners punctuating some equally memorable scenes.  (""We're in a tight spot!"") Where the movie falls short of some of their other efforts is the overall plot -- ""O Brother"" is more a mishmash of loosely related scenes than an actual story; as such, it sometimes drags or otherwise fails to grab your attention. Still, all in all, quite good -- and I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the Delta bluegrass soundtrack, which adds a healthy amount of texture and depth to the laid-back charming fun that is ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?""

At times in the middle of this picture, it started to slow down and all of the characters started to run together. What makes a character actor interesting is when he/she is playing opposite some straight characters as well.  There were so many character actor roles in this, that at times it got a bit tiring to watch. Kinda like The Grinch Whole Stole Christmas, but nowhere as bad.The movie picks itself back up from Clooney's bootstraps and he and Holly Hunter (who had a way too small role in this) show us how these types of roles are done.

196,RaiderJack,One of the Coen's Brothers Very Best!!,9,21 May 2007,"I must say at the outset that I am a TOTAL Coen Brothers fan and have seen ALL of their projects. This ranks right up there as one of their crowning achievements.This is a re-telling of the ""Odyssey"" by Homer and after viewing this, I finally got a handle on just what the ""Odyssey"" was about. In a nutshell, it follows the exploits of a man and the exotic characters he meets along his journey. The way the Coen Brothers personified such stalwart literary characters as the Cyclops (John Goodman) and the Furies is most creative.Excellent performances all around from the likes of George Clooney (in one of his most endearing roles), the incomparable John Goodman, Holly Hunter, John Turturo, Charles Durning and a wonderfully strong supporting cast.However, one cannot mention the merits of this movie without a mention of the soundtrack. It is most obvious that the Coen Brothers invested an enormous amount of research to make sure that the music adequately accompanied the mood and tone. A wonderfully indelible example is the use of an acapella song (that utilizes no words, only moans) still used in African-American churches that is beautifully realized.The music in this project is positively spellbinding, regardless of your particular musical preferences - there is something here for everybody. The soundtrack deserved the kudos it received.This one you will enjoy over and over and over again!!!! Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeexcellent!","O Brother, Where Art Thou"

198,angelynx-2,Rich and beautiful,9,13 January 2001,"I have been shaking my head over the reviews this film is getting - even Roger Ebert and CNN, not to mention many writers here, apparently find it disjointed and plot less. How bizarre! I, and my housemates, walked out raving about the tightness of the plot. No character is superfluous, every thread begun is knotted in at the end - it's as neat as fine beadwork. I don't want to give away plot points, but trust me, it's just delectable how elegantly characters weave in and out of the plot, found and lost and saved just in time to do their part. Look, just for one example, at the scene where the Soggy Bottom Boys perform at the political rally, and at least five plot elements converge in about ten seconds of lovely reaction shots. Disjointed my boot! How can people be missing this?And that's not even all the good stuff! This is a beautiful movie, handsomely shot in bleached-out tones that fill the screen with the heat and weariness of the Depression South. The much-praised soundtrack deserves it. The performances are rich with quirky humor and affection; I can hardly remember feeling so good after a movie. That the Coens have chosen to use just about the entire catalog of pop-culture period Southern references - open-air baptism, singing chain gangs, the Ku Klux Klan, Huey Long-style politicians, bluesmen selling their souls at the crossroads - only adds to the abstracted and gentle comedy of the film. Even the firelit Klan meeting combines menace with absurdity, looking as if choreographed by the team of Leni Riefenstahl and Busby Berkeley. (Honestly, I just don't see all the ridicule and mockery of country Southerners that others are seeing here. It's too good-natured for that.) The thread of Homer's Odyssey runs through it more smoothly than you'd expect, from the prophetic, blind handcar man as Teiresias the seer (and maybe as Charon the boatman of the Styx as well); to the alluring sirens at the river --with a nod to Circe, the sorceress who turned men into animals, when a frog is mistaken for a transformed man; to big John Goodman as a club-wielding, eyepatched Cyclops; and of course to Ulysses' need to get home before his wife Penny (Penelope) remarries. And there are scenes of wonderful beauty and magic realism, like the singing, white-clad Baptists drifting through the woods toward the river, and the dreamy vision of the Sirens at their washing.This is a fine, fine movie, the Coens back at top form after the *utterly* disappointing and depressing ""Big Lebowski"", and the rest of 2001 is gonna have to do some work to come up with a better film.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
199,mercury-26,a musical journey,10,17 January 2001,"""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" is unmistakably a Coen brothers film. I first noticed the common denominator between all their films when I was watching ""Fargo"" for the first time: These guys' films feel like they're made up as they go along, even if they're not. Fortunately, the results are always good (aside from the disappointing ""Big Lebowski"").I suspect they employed their usual 'anything goes' strategy to ""O Brother"". This time though, whatever story there is seems to take a back seat to what the boys really hoped to accomplish with this film. In the liner notes to the film's soundtrack, the Coens describe the film as a sort of valentine to the music of the pre-Great Depression era. ""There are very few scenes in the movie that don't have an in-screen musical element to them,"" says Joel. Thinking back on the film, indeed, a scene not driven by music or built around music is hard to find. While the boys manage to piece together a quality story by merrying up folklore with the bonafide history of the South, it's all about incorporating the music, somehow, some way. ""O Brother"" is about as close as there is to a musical that isn't a musical.To quote the liner notes again, ""Before a single frame of film was shot, these musicians and others created the 'canvas' upon which the colorful saga of O Brother Where ArtThou? would be painted"". So first they had their theme, namely, spirituality. The condition of the soul. Sin, punishment, and forgiveness. The Coens must have felt that as long as they abided by this theme, the story would take care of itself. Any story about the old South could be about the thick mist of good and evil spirits that inhabit it. It's the American home of both God and Beelzebub, of more angels and demons than any other region. One of the film's best sequences features escaped convicts Delmar and Pete (Tim Blake Nelson and John Turturro) wading into a river to be baptised and cleansed of all sins. In the very next scene the convicts (Nelson, Turturro, George Clooney) pick up a hitchhiker (aptly named Tommy Johnson, played by Chris Thomas King) at a crossroads, who tells them he's just sold his soul to the devil so he can play the guitar and make lots of money. The four of them then proceed to the next recording studio and cut a hit record together. Fantasic!""O Brother"" is a playful, flaccid romp through the backwoods of Mississippi. I couldn't help but imagine how much fun these guys were having making this thing and the attitude is contageous. It's the year's funniest film. Ethan's too smart for his own good sometimes though, and a lot of it flies right over your head. The humor takes you by surprise but doesn't shock you.""O Brother Where Art Thou"" won't be looked back upon as a Coen brothers masterpiece. It's no ""Fargo"" or ""Miller's Crossing"".Grade: A-","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
200,iamyuno2,One Of The Best Comedies Ever Made,10,28 December 2013,"Arguably the best Coen brothers film ever (and that's saying a lot), this work of genius would be in my Top 10 great movie comedies of all time, if I had such a list. The script is brilliant, as is the story. Then add the off-the-charts performances of so many top-notch actors starting of course with George Clooney (who puts in a bravura performance that brings to mind the brilliance of a Cary Grant), John Turturro (who was never better and never more endearing, stealing many scenes in fact as the backwoods Pete Hogwallop), and Tim Blake Nelson as the lovable but terminally dumb Delmar O'Donnell...but then there are the exceptional performances of so many great character actors it's almost impossible to give everyone credit. Charles Durning puts in perhaps his funniest comic performance ever (you have GOT to see him dancing!) as Gov. Pappy O'Daniel. John Goodman...what a performance he delivers, as Big Dan Teague! You have to see this film just to see the incredible job Goodman does here (one of his best roles ever)! Even vignette-player and fine character actor Stephen Root impresses as a blind radio station guy - what an imagination! He creates one of the most memorable comic characters you'll ever see in a movie. He leaves an indelible impression, one of the highest points of a film with many high points. He will have you in stitches. I'm not a fan of Holly Hunter usually, but here even she puts in a brilliant performance as Clooney's quirky and quixotic wife. Ray McKinnon as Vernon T. Waldrip and Frank Collison as Wash Hogwallop - both bit parts - shine brightly as well. The music's incredible too - I had to buy both the DVD of the movie and the CD of the score, the music was so endearing. This movie sizzles on every level and the cast and crew all were on the top energy level in synch and with a chemistry rarely seen in film. Can't top this. (And, by the way - if you like this film, by the way - try to see Preston Sturges' great classic, Sullivan's Travels, upon which this movie was in part based.)","O Brother, Where Art Thou"

Both me and my daughter fell asleep towards the end. The film had two serious flaws - I couldn't understand the dialogue (due to the strong southern drawl), and (when I could hear what was said) it wasn't funny. Apparently, it was based on ""The Oddysey"" by Homer and - like most classic literature - the film was slow, difficult to follow, and boring.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"

203,pro_crustes,"Confusing, but pretty to look at.",6,18 July 2001,"Touted as a version of Homer's Odyssey, this could-have-been-great film is beautifully photographed, but makes no sense.  Forced inclusions of Homer's famous characters (The Sirens and Polyphemus being the most broadly recognizable) don't help prevent this oddment from ultimately failing to meet its own goal of being about... well, what?  It's the comic evolution of three men escaping from a Depression-era chain gang.  Clooney, playing the overeducated leader, has some witty lines, drawing their laughs from the misfit way he rambles polysyllabically (sp?) at simple folk who neither know, nor really care much, what he is talking about.  Finally, neither will you, as it turns out he has no real mission.  The character himself turns out to be confused, despite his vocabulary, even to the point of flatly ignoring the severe beating a friend receives while sitting next to him. The ""Odyssey"" metaphor ultimately fails, too, as he is not quite rewarded with his archetype's deserts, gaining nothing of any great consequence in the end.  See it after ""Being John Malkovich,"" if you liked that film (Carter Burwell, who scored the latter, added some music to this one, too).","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
204,EThompsonUMD,O Brother! Why Art Thou?,3,27 January 2001,"Although not a big Coen brothers fan, I am an admirer of their dark humor films like 'Fargo' and 'Miller's Crossing.' I have been much less impressed by their other comic mode, goofy-camp (or is that Camp Goofy?) Unfortunately, 'O Brother, Where Art Thou?' falls into the latter category and isn't even as good as 'The Big Lebowski' or 'The Hudsucker Proxy.''O Brother' is basically an episodic series of in-jokes without much point, and not all that much humor or cleverness either. As most reviewers have noted, the film's plot is very loosely  and, as far as I could tell, quite arbitrarily  based on The Odyssey. Its main character, Ulysses Everett McGill (George Clooney), is an 'adventurer' like his Homeric namesake and has as his 'real' goal the return home to prevent the marriage of his wife Penny to a suitor. Of course, we don't discover that this is what the Clooney/Ulysses character really wants until long after we've stopped caring. And what does Homer have to do with ""Cool Hand Luke"" chain gangs, Ku Klux Klan meetings a la ""Indiana Jones"" cult gatherings, a disbarred lawyer's vocabulary, a talent for blue-grass country music singing, an association with Baby Face Nelson, a Clark Gable lookalike hairdo, and other random and sundry character traits and encounters? I leave that for others to discern.The allusion to Preston Sturges' 'Sullivan's Travels' in 'O Brother's' title is equally pointless. Yes, viewers familiar with the Sturges minor screwball comedy classic might find it mildly rewarding to recognize the title of the socially conscious Depression movie Sullivan abandons Hollywood and comedy hoping to make. And they might even be mildly amused by a couple of shot/scene riffs (e.g. hopping freight cars, and the chain gang shuffle into view a movie). But so what? The Coen brothers don't seem to have anything to add to the art-for-art's-sake versus moral high seriousness critical debate about the function of art. They obviously fall into the former school, but that doesn't seem to motivate the reference in the slightest. Is it an homage? If so, why make it? I like post-modern pop culture reference and textual play as much as the next person, but it's a lot nicer when it amounts to something at least tonally, if not thematically, consistent  and not just an arbitrary concoction.This screenplay is simply a silly mess. The only consistent, and consistently pleasing, element is the folk/country music soundtrack. It doesn't have much to do with Homer or Preston Sturges, but, considering the rest of the film, that's probably a good thing. On the other hand, I'd recommend using the price of admission on the soundtrack CD.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
205,Mr_Mirage,Is there room for whimsy in the 21st Century?,10,24 March 2001,"1st: A disclaimer: If the title credits show the names Joel and Ethan Coen, it is a 10 in my book. The only exception would be Crimewave, which is almost a 10  simply due to it's Marx Brothers level of insanity and over the top silliness.O Brother, Where Art Thou? is so sublime, so perfect... a minuet in a world of heavy metal, a meraingue in a universe of soft serve.The film is seamless, and yet certain images remain: the ghostly Baptists approaching the river; the 3 weird sisters; each and every scene with Goodman; and my favorite, the burning cross that falls onto the KKK... reason enough to see the film, IMHO.The music on the soundtrack is must-hear.

206,javaman-7,""" . . . and the Oscar goes to . . . HOMER!""",10,17 September 2007,"Java Man Reviews ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" (2000, PG-13). Directed by Joel Coen. Written by Ethan Coen and Joel Coen. Starring George Clooney, John Turturro, Tim Blake Nelson, John Goodman and Holly Hunter. Running Time: 103 minutes. Originally appeared in LakewoodBuzz.com.OVERVIEW: During the 1930s, Ulysses Everett McGill (Clooney) and two of his prison pals, Pete and Delmar (Turturro and Nelson) escape from a Mississippi chain gang and embark upon a Depression era odyssey. While their primary goal is to locate an elusive buried treasure, Ulysses is also eager to return to his long-neglected wife, Penny (Hunter). Along the way, the trio's exploits parallel those of the hero of Homer's hexameters: They meet a blind prophet who guides their journey, a one-eyed brute (Cyclops) who thwarts it, and seductive sirens who pleasantly divert it. As the journey continues, ancient Greek mythology merges with modern American myth, with the landscape yielding up fabled characters from our own time, including outlaw George Nelson (""Don't call me Baby Face!"") and blues legend Robert Johnson (who sold his soul at the crossroads in exchange for guitar-playing genius.) Like the Odyssey, this movie moves magnificently toward an action-packed conclusion.REVIEW: 4 STARS OUT OF 4"" . . . and the Oscar goes to . . . HOMER!"" Though the Academy doesn't give out awards to 2,800-year-old epic poets, this film was nominated for best-adapted screenplay, with the ""material previously published"" being Homer's Odyssey. In earlier years, the Academy has given awards for original story, and once engraved a statuette for George Bernard Shaw for 1938's Pygmalion. (A bit of trivia: Shaw is the only person to have won both a Nobel Prize for Literature and an Oscar.) Whether it's Homer, Shakespeare, Shaw or the Coen Brothers, great stories make great movies.But the Coens ransack more than just Homer. The title of this film comes from Preston Sturges' 1941 classic, Sullivan's Travels, in which the title character wants to make a serious film, and has titled it ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" And of course, Sullivan's Travels, pays homage to Jonathan Swift's Gulliver's Travels, which in turn looks back to Homer's Odyssey. The performances also run back and forth through time. At the center of it is Clooney who plays Ulysses like the reincarnation of Clark Gable, even down to the well-trimmed mustache. One of today's big stars plays one of yesterday's big stars playing a character whose first name is the Latin version of Odysseus. Again, it all comes back to Homer and his seminal story.Coen regulars also portray a parade of quirky characters. Goodman is intimidating as the one-eyed Bible thumper who parallels Homer's Cyclops. (Look for him too in a hilarious Ku Klux Klan scene where his sheet has only one eye hole.) As the poet's Penelope, Hunter embodies a more modern, less constant version of wifely virtue, with seven daughters and little patience for her absent husband. Turturro is completely submerged in the pensive character of Pete, while Nelson's deadpan Delmar is performed with perfect comic timing. Even cameos were played to perfection, such as Stephen Root's blind radio station owner.Roger Deakins' Oscar-nominated cinematography provides generous views of the Mississippi countryside, adding to the film's epic quality. The music, which both the characters and the filmmakers take seriously, accounts for much of the movie's spirit. The twangy tunes were put together by a collaboration of some of today's finest folk musicians, including T-Bone Burnett and Gillian Welch.Like epic poetry, film can carry us beyond the horizon, beyond hard times, to a place where the spirit of the Odyssey and the spirit of the American dream become one.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"

210,eaglejet98,Absolutely terrible.,1,13 January 2005,"This is one of the worst films I have ever seen.George Clooney is a great actor when he stars in a good (or even mediocre) film. But in many respects he reminds me of Steve McQueen; whenever he takes a role in a poor film, his presence alone is not enough to carry the story, and he is very poor at comedy or self parody.""Oh Brother..."" is a perfect example of a bad film that George Clooney cannot save. The acting is juvenile, the story is dreary and rambling and the only good aspect, the title song, is only sung once or twice.Disappointing all around.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
211,Essex_Rider,A complete and utter joy.,10,15 January 2004,"I very rarely have any wish to watch a film where country music dominates it, so it was with an almost bored and disinterested mood I settled down to watch this with my wife. Within five minutes my position had changed. George Clooney is a revelation and I started laughing as soon as he was dragged from the boxcar by his prison chains. I also found it evocative and moving as the trio of the hapless wandered through the Bible Belt in the time of the great depression. I really can't say the film had a leading actor, because the three protagonists were equally excellent. I loved the music and I have to say, I bought the CD for the sheer pleasure of hearing Man of Constant Sorrow', and Jail House Now'. The story oscillates from the comic to the ridiculous and on to the moving seamlessly, and how on earth it flopped in the Cinema is a mystery.I believe this will be a cult movie in years to come and will be a defining moment in the career of George Clooney.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
212,IanIndependent,OH Brothers! Thou art Art,8,19 July 2021,"The Coen Brothers don't think like the rest of us. They are refreshingly different. A class apart. Since 'Blood Simple' the brother have been doing it for themselves. They certainly don't make films that are like those of anyone else. And... that is good.Although. 'Oh Brother, Where Art Thou' is not really an original story. It is in fact based, very, loosely, on Homer's Odyssey (or so I'm lead to believe - how would a simple Yorkshire lad know such a thing?) and takes a modern Laurel and Hardy approach to stereotypical - might have been offensive in other hands- view of Southern State events, people and folklores and make a truly original and funny film that is wholly Coen entertainment.It is a joyous film that just flows as we meet and greet various places and people along the films winding route. It is in some ways like 'Forrest Gump' only it never becomes in anyway tedious and has great music and dance moves.A fine and vital cinematic celebration of life's up and downs and completely absorbing and hilarious. .","O Brother, Where Art Thou"

214,Big S-2,A complete waste of time,1,18 May 2001,"I guess everyone's entitled to their own opinions about a movie, be they good or bad. But I just couldn't believe how many of the reviewers on this page wrote in such glowing terms about this turkey, and I can't help but feel that there's an element of the `Emperor's New Clothes' syndrome creeping in somewhere. No doubt the aforementioned hacks will all scream `Philistine' if and when they bother to read this particular review, but I for one found this film dull and tedious in the extreme. I found myself waiting for something momentous to happen but nothing really did. The whole thing just plodded along at snail's pace  uninspiring plot lines leading toward an equally uninspiring ending. By far the worst movie that George Clooney has ever been involved in. His character was obviously intended to be the brains of the trio alongside those two other dimwits, but the whole sorry bunch were just annoying and tiresome, GC included (and that accent - oh dear me). I usually enjoy movies set in the depression era and I sat down in eager anticipation to watch this one. The 30s backdrop and the atmosphere conjured up by the bluegrass soundtrack were perhaps the film's only saving graces. But the plot (such as it was) and the characters were just awful. I watched this movie with my wife and an American friend from the `deep south' and they too were bored out of their minds by it. Not worthy of all the hype, no way!!!","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
215,yddsp@aol.com,Here's to Homer....,10,19 December 2007,"This movie is the funniest rendition of the Odyssey I have ever seen, bar none. Odysseus, Ulysses to us of the Italian persuasion, lol, certainly has his hands full in his fervent quest for a return to his previous life of normalcy, and always just one step ahead of the law. While it is true that Tim Blake Nelson's performance steals the show, my own personal favorite is that of George Clooney's and his unyieldingly optimistic albeit pseudo-intellectual persona as it keeps the dialogue flowing and the storyline both humorous and riveting. I especially loved the ""Soggy Bottom Boys"" in their performance of ""Man of constant sorrow"", it certainly was ""bona fide"", LOL...but then again, coming from the ""petter' familias"", LOL, you wouldn't expect anything less would you? I would endeavor to say that another story of this ilk, containing various parallels, besides the movie ""Sullivan's Travels"" is that of the more well-known classic ""The Wizard of Oz"", though I cannot verify intent nor origin. So, although it may not be a ""bona fide"" hypothesis from which I bespeak, LOL, there are many similarities between them....bona fide or not.

219,filmfan92,"""O Brother"" is righteous",9,8 April 2007,"The Coen Brothers may just be cinema's greatest crackpot auteurs-they deliver sly, ironic stories that generally consist of several weird and wild subplots that all collide in an ending that always leaves a few loose ends for the audience to ponder. Bless them. In the midst of the blockbusters franchises and hipster road movies, seeing a Coen Brothers movie is like inhaling a breath of fresh air. This one is no exception. 'O Brother Where Art Thou' is an adaptation of Homer's sprawling Greek tragedy 'The Odyssey', retold in a new setting-Dustbowl-era Mississippi. George Clooney stars as Ulysses Everett McGill, a slick, suave greaseball of a man who was arrested for practicing law without a license. When he hears that his wife(Holly Hunter)is getting re-married to another man (the hysterical Ray McKinnon), Ulysses busts loose from a chain gang to set things right. However, he must drag along the two men who are chained to him; violent, confused Peter (John Turturro) and ditsy, dim Delmar (Tim Blake Nelson is witty without being one-dimensional). Along the way, the Coen Brothers find time to pack in a run-in with real-life criminal Babyface Nelson, a group of bewitching she-devils, a huge flood, and a KKK rally attended by a hopeful politician and a malicious one-eyed Bible salesman (John Goodman plays him with what could only be described as beastly allure). Through it all, the film (photographed ravishingly by Roger Deakins) is set to a glorious soundtrack of roots music. John Hart, Chris Thomas King and Allison Krauss all deliver excellent tracks, but the real highlight is when Clooney and his co-horts burst into a toe-tapping version of ""Man of Constant Sorrow"", not for the sake of the plot, but for pure enchantment. And that's what 'Brother' is all about-not story (although it has a great one), but serving up a great slice of unadulterated folksy bliss.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"

All the references to The Odyssey were fun, especially the teasers where they led you to think one thing would happen (to follow The Odyssey's story), then gave it a twist to keep you on your toes. I never expected to enjoy ""old-timey"" music that much either. All the characters were done well, and you really got the impression that almost every actor in the movie was having an awful lot of fun.The Klan scenes seemed awfully reminiscent of the Wizard of Oz (the oh-wee-oh guys etc.). It seemed like a deliberate reference.I was also struck by the amount of racial tolerance displayed in the movie. So often, movie-makers paint a picture that suggests everyone in the South before the civil rights movement either was a Klansman or supported the Klan. This movie bucks that stereotype by making the Klan into a disliked lunatic fringe.Anyway, the movie was great fun!","O Brother, Where Art Thou"

222,Hairy_Lime,One of the Coen Bros. Best. SPOILERS,9,6 April 2004,"Sometimes, Coen Brothers movies can come off as overly mannered.  Sometimes, that ruins the film; other times, you get O Brother Where Art Thou?  This movie does not exist in any kind of reality; the characters talk, move and think in a way that has no connection with how humans talk, move and think. And yet, this movie works almost completely.Perhaps it's the strange mixture of mythic and human; perhaps it's the dialouge, perhaps its the way the Coen Brothers focus on absurdities of behavior and make them the key to the characters.  Or perhaps, the movie works because it is the funniest of the Coen Brothers movies.  The whole movie is shot in a sepia wash that makes the movie feel old; perhaps the style of the acting in the movie represents a time when the whole cinematic world was bitoned.  Or perhaps its that old-timey music.Whatever.  The plot of the movie loosely follows the Odyssey, with a few obvious nods to the Wizard of Oz thrown in - the KKK Klose Order Drill team was outrageous.  Clooney, Turturro and Nelson play three convicts escaping from a prison chain gang - and apparently the devil as well.  Along the way, they meet the cyclops, turn into toads, are seduced by sirens, become old-timey singing stars, are nearly hung, are nearly drowned, and eat roast gopher.  (""Gopher, Everett?"" has become one of my favorite lines in recent movies; the way Nelson says it repeatedly, and the look of that poor gopher on a stick....).  In the end, they find a treasure, even if it is not the treasure they seek.As I mentioned, the performances are incredibly unnatural and mannered, so it is hard to judge them by regular standards.  Still, Clooney, Turturro and Nelson - especially Nelson - all pull off their characters admirably.  And as always with the Coens, the direction is interesting.  Not as good as Fargo and Blood Simple, but still quite fine.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"

225,msultan,"O Muse, what have they done?",7,20 June 2003,"I read on the trivia page that the Coen brothers hadn't read TheOdyssey before working on O Brother Where Are Thou, and I reallybelieve that.  If they had, this could have been a really smart movie.As it is, it vaguely refers to parts of The Odyssey, without muchthought being put.  The few scenes that are inspired by TheOdyssey are clustered together and late in appearing. I got theSirens' part, but why mix that with Circe?  Why does the KKKmeeting represent Hades (Hades in not hell and is not limited to'bad' people)?  What the heck is Cyclops doing there anyway?These elements are too randomly included for the movie to ""bebased"" on The Odyssey.One huge difference between O Brother and The Odyssey is thecharacter of Odysseus -he wasn't a thief, he was a king!  Hetraveled 10 years to reach his home and lost all his men on theway.  His outer beauty reflected his nobility and wit.  In a word, hewas perfect.  Although Clooney's character is a smartass, he's notexactly smart.  Penelope is of course the other great character inThe Odyssey, where she patiently waits for Odysseus's return,who , upon his return, kills all the suitors who abused thehospitality they were offered.  O Brother also forgets Telemachus,their son. If this movie intended to transpose scenes from The Odyssey ontothe rural American South, it could have done so in many differentways, but I guess reading Homer should have been the first step.Magic could have been out of it then.I failed to find this movie 'hilarious' but I did find the photographybeautiful, as well as the incorporation of music.  I am not veryfamiliar with the Coen's films -I only saw Fargo and that was 2weeks ago- but they seems stuck on idiocy, and I have a hard timeappreciating that.  Another thing they seem to do is open with ageneral appeal. In O Brother the opening lines of The Odysseyappear, and in Fargo we are told that the following story is true(which isn't because there's a disclaimer with the end credits).  I'mnot sure what the point of these openings is since they're bothdeceptive. Overall, this movie could have been full of genius with smarthumor and wonderful references, but I guess it falls short ofachieving that.  The end result is a little weak -or not as good as itought to be.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"

I just didn't know how good it was or what kind of movie it was. Didn't think of looking it up on the net either. Anyway as you all know this is related to the Odyssey. It's a great story, has great old timey music, is very comical, and just a good feel watch. It never gets old to me. I watch it at least twice a year. Give it a watch if you haven't. Unless you hate any of the things I mentioned, you'll love this movie too!","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
227,Jeddia,Pure Art,9,19 June 2001,"I'm amazed at how many shallow comments are here on imdb for this film. Everything from ""slow"", ""bad music"", to (my personal favorite) ""stereotypically racist""...You people obviously didn't get it.  And you never will.  For those of you who enjoyed O Brother, read on =)
They've done it again.  O Brother is another beautifully crafted film about extremely freakish people involved in extraordinary circumstances in an odd, surreal setting.  These factors can be applied to all the Coen Bros. films. It's what makes them fresh and enjoyable.  The dialogue alone is worth the viewing.  (e.g., the conversation in the car after they pick up the guy who just sold his soul to the devil).I did read one comment that was very true:  You either hate these films or you love them.  Well, I love them.  Raising Arizona will never leave my Top 10.  And I may have to add O Brother to that esteemed list as well.  9 of 10.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"

John Turturro, another talented actor, also does a great job.However, I bought the soundtrack of this movie first and as a result had certain expectations built up around it. The music is beautiful and actually plays a rather large part in the movie, so if you have no interest in bluegrass/folk or such similar stuff, you probably won't enjoy O Brother.I'm not sure, of course, but that's sort of the impression I've gotten.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"

I believed that everybody in the film did outstanding in this movie. i just saw this movie yesterday at the theaters and I was really impressed by it. When I when to the theater for ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"", people saw it because of George clooney and how much of a hunk he is. For me, i saw it because of the Coen Brothers. There are outstanding and talented filmmakers and I can't wait to see more of their work. They did a magnificent job on this movie and plus, they have a really good idea of how to make people laugh. The Coen Brothers are one of those writer/directors that are good at it. I hope this film gets some Oscar nominations. This is a very funny film and Joel and Ethan Coen, if you're reading this, i love you guys. Hey, cast me in one of your movies.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"

He told the boys the treasure in the bottom of the lake. But after all the treasure is the ring that belongs to the main charactor. I think it happend because after the boys confession, they didn't believed in God. God saved his life but throw the ring away. this time the old man in the very begining showed up. i suppose God changed to him. second, George's ""wife"" was cural to her husbened just because he don't have money. that is very different.(Please don't look at it thanks)","O Brother, Where Art Thou"

Here he plays the same person he played in ER and in THE PERFECT STORM.  His Southern accent comes and goes, and his range is from here to here, especially when compared to the rest of the excellent cast.  Hopefully, the Academy will not confuse him with his co-stars.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
233,mmunies,Starting the year off right,9,14 February 2001,"I'm so glad I finally got a chance to see this film before it got away. It was a movie that was lots of fun and greatly entertaining.  Not a movie to take seriously but you can still see the parallels between it and Homer's Odyssey. It's a pretty broad parody on southern life and the 1930's.  The actors even act like they are 1930 type parodies.  Clooney was just great - totally unlike I've seen him before.There were a few plot holes but not anything that you would count against this film. The movie really drew me in and I kept wondering what was happening next.All in all, a lot of fun.  I hope they make more movies like this one.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"

I felt pretty much the same way once I saw the actual film. Clooney is fun to watch, and the bits about his hair cream made me chuckle a few times, but, I'm sorry, I need more than hair cream jokes.  It was one of those movies where a lot transpires on the screen, but nothing really happens.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"

The video store was out of all the movies I was planning on renting, so then I came across this. I came home and as I watched I became engrossed and found myself laughing out loud. The Coen's have made a magnificiant film again. But I think the first time you watch this movie, you get to know the characters. The second time, now that you know them, you laugh sooo hard it could hurt you. I strongly would reccomend ANYONE seeing this because if you are not, you are truly missing a film gem for the ages. 10/10","O Brother, Where Art Thou"

Coen brothers usually make good movies, Fargo and Barton Fink were good. This movie and Big Lebowski are just awful.

237,ignatiusloyala,An interesting farce,7,22 June 2002,"The Coen brothers have definitely made better movies than 'O Brother, Where Art Thou?', but it by no means means that this movie is not good. The movie is presented very light-heartedly and the story is a bit exaggerating. However, it is this which makes this movie an interesting farce. Jokes flood every part of the film, and even though the story itself makes little sense, it gives us a great shot of fun at least. In fact, I kept laughing all the time while watching! If you are expecting great acting, Clooney, Tuturro and Nelson won't disappoint you. Indeed, they form a golden triangle much stronger than that in 'Three Kings'! All in all, the film is fairly good, and undoubtedly one of the best in 2000.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
238,Rupert__Pupkin,Boring about sums it up,3,25 July 2001,"I watched this movie because it featured John Turturro, one of the finest actors of our time. But this movie is boring, no two ways about it. I've heard time and time again how great the music is, but great music doesn't make a great movie. It simply makes a great soundtrack. O Brother can't decide where it wants to go. Is it about a man and his distant wife, a singing group, convicts looking for treasure, a political race, etc? The movie is a collection of scenes that don't tie together. Normally if you film 100 different scenes something funny will happen, if only by accident. Not in this movie. Why do I need to submit 10 lines? I thought nine was sufficient.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"

The music is right up my alley, and George Clooney surprised me with his performance. The comment about his accent coming and going interested me.  Clooney was born in Lexington, Kentucky and grew up in the suburbs of Cincinnati, so a southern accent is not entirely foreign to him.  I thought he did a creditable job with it.
Charles Durning has made a very good living playing good ol' boys, and he does his usual stellar job here.  Holly Hunter's character doesn't have much screen time, but she definitely made the best of it.Yes, the story is pretty silly, but I rarely take anything seriously so it didn't bother me in the slightest.  On the contrary, I laughed more here than I have since Chicken Run.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
240,catmagicusa,I watched for the music and fell in love with the story too,10,9 October 2021,"I was a young fan of Allison Kraus, and Gillian Welch, and heard they were on this movie soundtrack. It seemed like a weird movie with some famous people, so I gave it a shot. I fell in love with the story, the music score, and the actors and actresses. Of course, having a liberal arts degree, I recognized a similarity to ""The Odyssey"" as a framework for this epic. However, I later learned the writers had not necessarily been influenced by it as much as it seemed. Too many hilarious and poignant scenes to discuss here, except to say, watch and fall in love with it yourself. There's a little something for everyone, even though it's 21 years old now.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"

The story (loosely based on Homer's epic poem ODYSSEY) is very entertaining.  The music was outstanding.I only had two complaints.  First, the Coen brothers tried to hard to make this picture ""cute"" or ""off-the-wall.""  By setting the adventure story in the depression-era south the way they did, they did not have to expend all that effort and energy.  The nature of the idea alone could have carried it off by itself.Second, George Clooney's acting was terrible.  He portrayed his role as a charicature as opposed to a character.  And that was completely out of step with the whole rest of the movie.But in the end these complaints are trivial in comparison to the final result which is an overall good time.Now it is time for me to go out and buy that soundtrack.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"

Let me just say, that ""Raising Arizona"" and ""The Big Lebowski"" are my two all time favorite films. Heck, ""Miller's Crossing"" and ""Blood Simple"" are as well. These are two incredible filmmakers, the best! However, this film was a dud! Very blah and cookie cutter, just not your standard Coen greatness. Maybe I am being too hard, but I don't think so. In most Coen films, the greatness comes from the assortment of crazy characters, that is what is sadly missing here. John Goodman and John Turturro are both wasted! George Clooney is good, but not enough to carry the film. A lot of old Coen favorites make cameos, but they look to be tacked on and not much else. I am sure that these legendary filmmakers will get it back, but this one was sadly lacking.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"

At least I wouldn't have had to listen to that awful ""music"".  The characters were so dimwitted...I felt like I was watching monkeys at the zoo.  Really dumb monkeys.Once I recovered from what the Coen brothers had subjected me to, I managed to get home to check the IMDB.  I wanted to see if the word was out on how awful this movie was.  I saw that it was CRIMINALLY over-rated by people that wrote reviews.  These reviews mean a lot.  I usually base my movie viewing decisions IMDB comments.I want to make it very clear that this movie is NOT for everyone.  The Coen brothers have a vocal minority that enjoys their movies.  These are the people that wrote the reviews for this movie.  This is a SMALL minority. This film did not make a lot of money.  When the awful soundtrack was disappearing off the shelves at your local music store, it was this small, vocal minority that was buying it.  If you can, try to listen to some of the songs.  The music does not have any mainstream appeal at all.  You could say the same thing about this entire movie.  I'm sure it's the perfect movie for someone on this planet, just not me, or anyone else I've ever met.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"

More great lines than Forrest Gump (another love-it-or-hate-it film), music that makes bluegrass fans out of old time rock-and-rollers, and a plot that goes back a few thousand years. The digital manipulation was astonishing. My favorite thing about this movie? It's truly a film for all ages.

Though not realistic, the characters in this film are both likable and comical. I love the language they use. For example, after picking up a hitchhiker who has sold his soul to Satan and noting that his other companions had become ""saved"" Everett comments that he is as of yet unaffiliated. Their odyssey leads them through some classical situations, but always with a humorous turn. Holly Hunter is Everett's beautiful but nagging wife, but his love for his daughters brings him back to the straight and narrow. Not only is the acting great, but the script is brilliant. The music is well-done and sometimes wonderful, especially at the baptism. If it had been rock and roll instead of country, I might have given it a 10.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"

They are on the run from the law, and hope to recover a heap of money to make all their woes float away. Along their travels, they meet a cadre of merry pranksters, fellow criminals, musicians, and even Klansmen. Their resolve and courage are tested time and time again throughout the film.The setting is gorgeous. It soddens you down and makes you feel warm and lazy, like you're sitting on a porch with a jug of whiskey, watching the scenes unfold before you. The soundtrack is a winning combination of bluegrass, country, and folk numbers that embellish the setting even more so.Every line of dialogue is smart, fitting perfectly within the big picture. The blocking is clever and on point. You feel very much for the downtrodden protagonists and their quest for redemption and hope they get away from the long arm of the law, which is portrayed in a terrifying way.This epic tale, although derived from ancient literature, becomes its own tale, and slowly wins over the hearts and minds of the audience with style, wit, humor, and adventure. The Coens have a firm grasp of the picture from start 'till end.Terrific terrific film.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
249,Twillhead,The Coen Brothers Triumph Again!,10,2 February 2002,"'O Brother, Where Art Thou' is a gleeful retelling of Homer's 'Odyssey', set in 1930s Mississippi and rampant with splendid quirkiness that is the trademark of the brothers Coen. Three hapless convicts make their escape to find treasure--and more than their share of adventure--in this delightful film. George Clooney is in fine, ingenuous form as the chatty, amiable leader of the trio; but the real acting kudos go to John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson as his goofy but lovable cohorts, dubbed the 'Soggy Bottom Boys' by Clooney's character after they receive baptism by full immersion in a river. The three cut a record under that homespun nom-de-plume for the cash, and unwittingly become overnight sensations with veritable 'rock star' status. The film is accompanied by enough music and songs to almost qualify it as a musical. And there are some incredible feats of film-making here: the scene at the KKK rally is a real doozy, and is so similar to the scene when Dorothy's friends rescue her from the witch's castle in 'The Wizard of Oz' that it almost amounts to cinematic plagiarism. And what an amazing work of plagiarism it is! Without giving away the ending, I must say the climax of the movie is one of the most breathtaking sequences put to film in recent memory (on a par with the spectacular finale of 'Magnolia', another one of my favorites). 'O Brother' is a must-see, a perfect 10!","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
250,DavidPumpkins,Outstanding...the best of 2000,10,3 May 2001,"Having missed this film on it's limited UK theatrical run I made sure I purchased it immediately after it's DVD release.  I wasn't disappointed, far from it.  ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" is the most enjoyable film I have had the pleasure to have watched recently and, although it may be considered sacrilege by Coen die-hards, I thought it was better than ""Fargo"" and, let's face it, that takes some beating.  The story is loosely based on Homer's Odyssey, the magnificent George Clooney plays Ulysses Everett McGill, the leader of an escaped chain gang which includes John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson.  En route to find some hidden treasure they encounter the Cyclops in the form of Coen stalwart John Goodman's Bible salesman and become embroiled in an election campaign between Klan leader Homer Stokes and governor Pappy O'Daniel.  It's surreal, entertaining and by far the best film of 2000 and it's such a shame that the academy and much of the public ignored it completely.  Clooney's performance is on a par with that in ""Out of Sight"".  Turturro is, as ever, excellent and the little known Nelson is surprisingly good as dim-witted Delmar.A real treat, and the music's great too.  Miss this at your cost.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"

254,ljsmith-25626,Needs Rewatching,6,13 June 2020,"Every time I watch a Coen Brothers flick I walk away feeling unsatisfied with my initial viewing (with the exception of Fargo, the brilliance of which is explicit). In the case of No Country For Old Men and The Big Lebowski I recall being very eager to start over, almost immediately as the final credits rolled. With O Brother, Where Art Thou? however I don't feel so ready to rewatch right away. My enjoyment of my first viewing was lacking somewhat compared to Lebowski and NCFOM. Nonetheless I will ensure I give OBWAT a second chance at some point to see if my initial rating can be boosted.I didn't particularly care much for the soundtrack, which is getting a lot of praise amongst other reviewers. I've read comments suggesting the film grows on you as it progresses, which I agree with but must note it takes over an hour of runtime before this takes effect. Before Clooney's revelation about the truth behind his ""buried treasure"" (which with some prior knowledge of Homer's Odyssey would not come as a shock or twist at all to the viewer) the film presents itself as one disjointed scene after another. I would actually recommend researching a brief summary of Odyssey before watching OBWAT, as I feel this could make certain scenes and characters seem less random and therefore more enjoyable. For instance John Goodman's cameo does not seem so bizarre upon reflection, having now garnered some awareness of Odysseus' foe the cyclops.Credit where it's due, O Brother, Where Art Thou? does serve well as a comedy and I did find myself laughing throughout. And kudos to the Coen Brothers for managing to tie up every loose end of their rambling sketch show-like story. My overall enjoyment of the film is reflected in my rating however, and until I get round to rewatching O Brother, Where Art Thou? I must stick with 6/10.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
255,Iammymothersdaughter2,Be 'thou' not afraid . . .,10,10 September 2001,"Living in Music City USA gave me perhaps a unique reason to see this film. We're proud of our country music roots here.  Out of those same roots have grown so many branches of music, including bluegrass.  For the love of that 'High Lonesome Sound' did I watch this film.  I was not disappointed with the music presented in the film.  I was further delighted that the film contained a plot warped enough to be fabulously entertaining as well.  If there is one thing that soils this movie's entertainment value in my opinion, it is the unnecessary and nearly constant (at times) use of ""G.D."" - the dialog was spicy enough without it and that particular word offends me.  But the music, the cinematography and the actors all combine to provide a movie that leaves you with that potato chip feeling of you can't do it just one time.  You must see this one over and over.  If for no other reason than to see George Clooney do the bowl-weevil, rubber-leg chicken dance in that long gray beard.  All in all a super Coen Brother's effort.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"

257,sdl-2,"O Barf Bag, Where Art Thou?",6,17 June 2001,"Oof! This terrible movie, which I regret having wasted any time on, is built around racist stereotyping of the lowest sort, except the characters are white Southerners, so I guess that makes it okay.  According to ""O Brother Where Art Thou"", everyone in 1930's Mississippi was either a dancing Klansmen, a  dumb cracker, or a generic black victim (who gets virtually no lines in the film). I think the low point (and there were many in this horrible movie) had to be putting Ralph Stanley's sublime masterpiece ""O Death"" into the mouth of the Klan Grand Dragon as the prelude to a lynching. For old-time music lovers, this is roughly the equivalent of what a Catholic would feel watching a porn actor belt out ""Ave Maria"" right before a big sex scene.George Clooney proves once again that he can't act, John Turturro reminds everyone how well he can, Charles Durning gets a few laughs, and Gillian Welch, Emmylou Harris, and the rest of the singers get a paycheck at the expense of their immortal artistic souls.How could the Coen Brothers, makers of some of the best movies of the last 20 years, be responsible for this travesty?","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
258,PStyles,One of my Favorite Movies of all Time,10,10 May 2013,"Over the years, i've watched this movie maybe 20 or 30 times and every time I find something new to laugh about. The Coen Brother have crafted a hilariously dysfunctional buddy movie in O Brother, Where art Thou? which never ceases to make me smile. Loosely based off Homer's epic ""The Odyssey"", the story follows 3 men who, after escaping from a chain gang in depression era Mississipi, set out on a search for buried treasure left behind by George Clooney's character Ulysses Everett McGill. Along the way they meet all sorts of quirky characters which include an unscrupulous Bible Salesman, a horse eating redneck, a bank robbing lunatic, an ornery flour tycoon(who also happens to be Governor), a young man who sells his soul to the devil and a very peculiar blind man who owns a recording studio. It's safe to say the Coen Bros. took their time fleshing out the minor roles in this film and every new character you encounter feels very original. Credit is also due to the actors for performing these roles, but the writing in this movie is simply fantastic.Which brings me to my next point. The dialogue in this script is some of the funniest, most entertaining in films today. Everett McGill(played by Clooney) is the smooth talking, seemingly over-educated convict who self appoints himself leader of the escapees and is easily the bright spot of this film. Clooney's character is as hilarious as he is flamboyant and is definitely one of his best acting performances to date. Tuturro and Nelson are also quite funny as the bumbling idiot companions to McGill as they set out across Mississipi looking for the treasure. Some of the funniest moments in this movie involve simple conversations between the 3 and seeing the clearly uneducated companions try to make sense of McGill's over expanded vocabulary. Holly Hunter is also great in this movie as McGill's estranged wife and adds an extra dimension to the story that is quite interesting. The Coen Brothers are known for writing fleshed out, quirky characters in their movies and this one is no exception. The writing is witty and the acting is exceptional by everyone. The theme is meant to be light hearted while also maintaining a sense of realism for the time period in which it is set. I give them a lot of credit for staying true to the accuracy of the period but also keeping the feel of the film lighthearted and fun(Tough to do as depression era Mississipi was not a lighthearted or fun period in time at all). I also have to add that the score of this movie fits perfectly, mixing old time county/bluegrass to perfect effect. Overall, this is not only one of the best Coen Bros. films but, in my opinion, one of the best 50 films of all time. The humor is(mostly) clean as well so it can be enjoyed by a wider age group than many modern comedies. A can't miss film by some of the best Writers/Directors of our time.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
259,imdb3-3,Brilliant Witty Quasi Musical,10,23 June 2003,"Any semi-intelligent person should be reasonably amused with any production by the Coen Brothers since incredible care is placed into mocking the specific characteristics of common ordinary people. O' Brother Where Art Thou is another success which, like other Coen Brothers films, has a number of messages for the viewer in the course of a film that has several, oddly connected and hilarious scenes.The dialogue is witty and in this film, a good amount of bluegrass music is interspersed with the theatre-like dialogue. Initially it takes a little getting used to in sliding into the concocted dialogue. But what really takes the cake in this film are the incredible performances by all the actors who each have their moment to shine.Clooney is remarkably good as Ulysses, the leader of the pack of convicts who escape a chain gang and wander into the wild, crazy, and mad world of the early 20th century. They come face to face with a number of characters that are included not only for the comedy, but much for the messages that the characters seem to give to the audience through their dialogue. What is wonderful is that the audience, if semi-intelligent, gets to put together the pieces of the moral vignette rather than having it spoon-fed in typical Hollywood style.The running hair joke in this film is hilarious. Even more remarkable is the great performance by comedic Tim Blake Nelson, a relative unknown. Turturro, Goodman, Hunter and Durning are all special as well but we've come to expect excellence from that group. Some may not care for the Coen brothers style but that is most unfortunate since you would be missing out on a collection of the world's greatest non-commercial films ever made in the face of pretentious Hollywood. This one is a winner and very entertaining.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
260,cking1010-458-184844,Great,9,7 July 2018,"I realize this movie came out 18 years ago, but I wasn't on IMDb then. Did IMDb even exist? I don't know. But as I'm sitting in the barbershop right now, this movie is being played on the tv right now, and I'm reminded how much I love this movie. In my opinion, one of the best comedies ever made. I know it's not for everyone (I have friends who hate it), but it's a classic to myself and some others I know. Excellent writing and acting.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
261,Hypotheses,Lackluster,6,19 November 2001,"O Brother, Where Art Thou? 6.5/10I didn't laugh out loud once. The Coen brothers should've went back to the drawing board on this one. Or, perhaps, they should have actually READ Homer's Odyssey rather than Cliff Notes, or not relied on it at all. The whole acknowledgement to Homer is just insulting. The characters were simply too weird even for a Coen brothers film. How many blind men were there? Three or four? While I admit that Clooney had the best dialogue, he was simply too handsome--or out of place--for this film. I wanted to laugh whenever he went into one of those pseudo-intellectual riffs, but I couldn't. Something was wrong about them. (The film tried to explain it away later--Everett went up for practicing law w/o a license--but I wasn't convinced. That was just way too convenient storywise.)
The only genuine thing I saw in all of O Brother was the Klan scene. When it came, I couldn't believe it. I was right at the edge of thunderous laughter, but after 2/3rds of squat, just I couldn't do it. I did, however, rewind the scene. It's probably the only thing I'll remember about the film. I'm not counting the backward trio's engaging song ""I'm a Man in Sorrow"", though. While I certainly liked it, it was an obvious plot device at its introduction. Everything felt haphazard, truncated, predictable. I just couldn't get into it, which is unusual, because I'm a Coen Brother's fan. So, I don't think it was me. They (the Coen Brothers) were simply off the mark this time. Go see Blood Simple or Fargo instead. 6.5/10","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
262,martinr,A total waste of time,2,4 February 2002,"When I first saw the preview for O Brother Where Art Thou, I said to myself ""That film looks terrible.""  I am a big Coen brothers fan - The Big Lebowski is among my favorite films and Fargo is a masterpiece.  However, something told me to just stay away from O Brother Where Art Thou.  After many months of convincing from friends that it was a great movie, I picked it up. 
What a waste of time.  The preview completely captures the essence of the movie.  It is a boring script that is made worse by pitiful acting performances, especially by George Clooney in the lead role.  Remember Keanu Reeves in Dracula?  That's the level of quality we're talking about here. Clooney could stay in his pseudo southern accent for no more than 2 or 3 seconds before he relapsed back to Batman or that guy on ER or any of the other terrible performances he has given in the past.  It was just pitiful to watch.  To me, the Coens have always made movies that make you laugh because of the intelligent humor in them.  In O Brother, they apparently went for slapstick and failed miserably.  If I wanted slapstick, I would watch Chris Farley and see it done much better.  I hope this film is not a sign of things to come.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"

I thought the music was the best part, much better than the humor. I started it one night and gave up. I came back the next day and tried to finish it and gave up again. I thought it was a real waste of time. Although I could see lots of of attempts at humor (A guy breaks off a dead branch from and tree and smacks an idiot in the face with it. His buddy watches this happen and sits still while the guy then bashes this second guy in the face. Some of the food he was eating flops out of his mouth as he falls [a little funny THERE] over.

265,rlowe30,Coen's Best,10,21 January 2001,"As one who grew up in Mississippi, and spent a great deal of time in the Mississippi Delta, I'm invariably disappointed and irritated by stock characterizations of southerners in movies.  This one gets it so right it's 'righter than realistic'.  In fact, I'm probably related to Delmar! Alternately hilarious and obtuse, ""O Brother, Where Art Thou"" takes us on the jailbreaking journey of three Depression era convicts.  All the locations are right and Tim Blake Nelson is unbelievably spot on with his period Delta dialect. George Clooney amazes me by making this acting choice, and where he misses the mark dialectically, he makes hay with his ""Ulysses"" character.  John Turturro is fantastic, too. But the real star of this one is the writer and director. I'll see this one again, many times.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"

267,RHKLWK,"And You Thought ""Planet of the Apes"" Was Bad!",1,27 May 2002,"This is an awful film.But first, an historical note:  The Confederate battle flag is the centerpiece of an ugly scene in this film involving the Ku Klux Klan.  For the record, the Confederate battle flag was NEVER associated with the Ku Klux Klan during its heyday.  If you take the time to look at any of the news reels from the 1920's and 1930's, including film clips of the thousands of robed klansmen marching down Washington, D.C.'s Constitution Avenue, the only flag you will see is ""Old Glory.""  The Confederate battle flag was MISAPPROPRIATED in the late 1950's and in the 1960's by groups opposing the integration of the public schools and, later, by the handful of ""yahoos"" in this country who claim to be sepratists and Aryans, ad nauseum.  The point is that Hollywood's fixation on the Confederate battle flag as a symbol of evil is a continuing slander on the memory of millions of Americans who fought for independence.But, back to the film.  I dislike the Coens because they are not just mannered, they are pretentious.  Come on, folks.  Be honest.  The Coens are indulging themselves.  And we, that small slice of the movie-going public with the brain cells to write a review, are letting them get away with it.The story?  What story?  It's just a series of scenes.  Unless you know something about Southern American history, the movie makes absolutely no sense.  Even then, it's a reach.  The ""story"" takes place in Mississippi, but the real Governor Pappy (""Pass the biscuits, please"") O'Daniel was a Texan, and the film's theme song, ""You are my Sunshine,"" was written by Louisiana's Depression-era governor, Jimmy Davis.  Symptomatic with the way Hollywood views the South, I suppose the Coens are trying to cover it all in one film.The characters?  George Clooney is laughable as Ulysses Everett McGill. This man obviously never spent one day on a chain gang, or one day in the South, pretend or otherwise.  Burt Reynolds would have been better, but then the art house crowd would never have gone for it.  Holly Hunter?  Her pained expressions were all too real, I am afraid.  She has no direction, no scenes, no lines, no personality, and no interest in the film.  And what a waste!  She's a real Southerner with a real Southern charm and attitude.Tim Blake Nelson as Delmar O'Donnell is just too painful to watch.  He had me wishing the witches had turned HIM into a toad.  But, on the other hand, he represents the Coens' view of Southern people, so his performance is not atypical.  Charles Durning is completely wasted as Gov. O'Daniel.  The man has some range, but here he is just a one-note blowhard.  (Remember him in ""The Sting"" and in ""Tootsie""?)  John Goodman?  Oh, please.
I did not care about any of the characters.  I thought the Coens were going to do something with Tommy Johnson (played by Chris Thomas), thinking perhaps that he would be the Coens' version of ""Leadbelly,"" but he makes no contribution.  We know nothing about him.  In the end, he's just a black guy with a guitar.  Michael Baldacci's turn as ""Baby Face"" Nelson is filler.Not surprisingly, it is hard to like ANYBODY in this film, which is characteristic of a film by the Coens.The film did win a couple of Oscars, including one for cinematography. But how?  Many of the daytime scenes are hazy and desperately in need of a filter, and those outdoor shots that are attractive, are no more attractive than the outdoor scenes you see in a typical episode of ""The Crocodile Hunter.""I wonder what Tim Burton is up to these days?","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
268,abdurehmanarshd,Don't remember much...,7,6 May 2021,"I wasn't that much impressed by writing but direction was superb. Loved the way Coen bros pulled the shots and pace altogether.

The music is beyond compare of any movie put out that year.  The cast is incredible.Three inmates break out of a chain gang to seek a treasure.  In running, they encounter all kinds of adventures: An old man who prophesies that they'll get treasure, but not that which they seek, 2 of the fugitives ""get saved"", and they meet a guitarist who helps them become a hit band.I can't think of a single thing wrong with this movie.The DVD version includes a video of ""Man of Constant Sorrow"", one of the incredible songs on this movie, but you'll want to view this over and over again, and hear all the music and see the adventure again and again.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"

Add to it having Charles Durning and it's a must see for me.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
271,Maxta,Great in almost every way,8,26 April 2002,"The Coen brothers have outdone themselves with O Brother Where Art Thou. A thoroughly enjoyable movie that takes you back to depression era USA to follow three escaped inmates across the state looking to find a great treasure.George Clooney does surprisingly well in his role of Ulysses Everett McGill, never once slipping out of character or out of accent for even a moment. John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson were perfect as Pete and Delmar respectively, and were a joy to watch. The often confused Delmar has many of the finest and funniest lines in the film and seems happy to go along with everything and anything. The small parts of John Goodman as Big Dan T and Michael Badalucco as George 'Babyface' Nelson do little more than reinforce the many references to Homer's Odyssey, but are still a welcome addition to the film.The cinematography also deserves a mention with many wide shots of the open plains and fields of they early 1900s, along with radio shacks, town halls and general stores. Each drawing you more into the film.And finally the soundtrack. Absolutely brilliant!! I can't say enough good about this. The fact that the soundtrack was more successful than the film, alone says it all. The pure sounds of blues, bluegrass and old timey are easy on the ears. I would, however, like to have the chance to hear Clooney singing In Constant Sorrow himself (it was dubbed even though he practiced for months), perhaps a feature on the DVD...Overall a film that will have you tapping your foot and crying with laughter. See this film. You won't be disappointed.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
272,Bilstein,A great laugh,9,15 July 2001,"This film was pleasantly surprising. The concept of 'three idiots who escape from jail' seemed like a simple idea that could be made funny, if handled properly.It was funny right from the beginning. Moving at a quick pace, it didn't take any time to be boring and show you how these three blokes met or what they're in jail for. Instead, it goes right to action, and the humour comes thick, fast and very funny.Watch out for the toad scene, it's hillarious.9/10 - though some might find the stereotyping 'offensive.'","O Brother, Where Art Thou"

Great scenes, from the opening train scene (laughed so hard I cried) to the bluegrass.Watch it.  It's good, it's great, it's funny, and it's based on a famous story.  Worth your while, believe me.

274,stefano1488,What's the point of this film anyway?,2,5 August 2020,"I was curious to watch this film, remembering the rave reviews.
After a few minutes, I was already doing something else, waiting for the film to end.
I have never quite understood why the Coen brothers are held in such high esteem by cinema critics; after watching at least six of their films, I can say that only two of them deserved some appreciation (""No Country for Old Men"" and ""Burn after Reading""), the two of them in which their sarcasm is not an end in itself. But what about the rest? You find yourself constantly awaiting a funny sarcasm that never comes. I don't find them amusing, their films are damp squibs, but a certain type of intellectuals like them because they look so cynical and blasé, which makes them look cool (same reason why Tarantino is so acclaimed, in my opinion).
But when I think about corrosive satire it's Monty Python that comes to my mind, not the Coen brothers.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"

276,LessThanPaddy,Musical ecstasy.,8,20 February 2017,"This film is incredibly well cast, I can't praise the actors enough... The three main protagonists are extremely amiable. The likes of John Goodman, who I've never been a particular fan of to date also deserves praise for his part, as do almost all of the cast list. By the end, you'll truly find yourself attached to the protagonists, and you'll be invested in their well-being. Indeed, the cast plays an imperative role in this production,but they aren't the only aspect that requires praise.The whole concept of the plot being centered around Greek mythology is genius, and works astonishingly well. The whole production is very original, honestly there are few films like this one.But of course, the best aspect of the whole film is by far the musical contribution. Picking a favorite song is hard, every single one is naturally catchy. Truthfully, even if the casting was below par and the Greek mythological dimension was absent from the film, the music alone could probably carry it in my opinion. Indeed, from the very opening scene the musical dimension is ever-present and never fails to deliver on the next hit. I'm surprised to see myself write that, as someone who has never been a fan of musicals.Give this one a watch for sure, I haven't heard a bad word about it to date and I can't imagine I ever will.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
277,polos_are_minty,"An enjoyable, if not forgettable Clooney vehicle.",7,8 April 2010,"O Brother, Where Art Thou is a visually impressive film, with a great soundtrack, amusing characters, a few passing references to Homers epic Odyssey and a slightly above average plot.In a lot of ways the Coen Brothers have taken all the elements which make a blockbuster, added in a few extra ingredients of their own, stirred it all together and come out with what is an enjoyable little story. Many people cite the films references to the Odyssey as an important part of the story, I don't however see this. That's not to say there aren't any, what I am trying to say is that the film is more reliant on it's own unique and interesting characteristics, as opposed to those of a 4000 year old text.The colour in which the film is shot, is possibly one of the most important elements in generating the character of the picture. I think that shooting the picture, without the colour correction which was used in O Brother, would of detracted from the feel of the film. The dusty look, sums up the character of the Southern states. It also gives something of a dirty and lower class feel, which is perhaps important when we consider the backgrounds of the three lead characters.The music of the film is another important element. Which is again one of the things the film would not be able to be as enjoyed nearly as much without. The music adds to the rustic feel that the colouring of the film does. It also helps push through the spirit of the era in which the film is set. A particularly strong example of this is the Baptism scene. Christianity is obviously an important part of life in Ameirca, and the Gospel bands that have appeared in that area have spread throughout the world. This scene is particularly entertaining, and the music enhances the effect. If they had chosen any other type of Christian Hymn the scene would weaken considerably.However I am critical of the lead Actor, George Clooney. He dominates the film, in a larger then life manner. But, I don't think this is a good thing. From the opening moments, Clooney grabs the film by the throat and doesn't let it go. There is rarely a point where he is not centre of attention, and he always seems to position himself so that he is the dominate figure in a scene. Even in cases where he shouldn't be. The scene in the Barn is particularly irksome, with Clooney hogging the camera. I was amazed to learn that he earned a Golden Globe for this performance, because I really think that this is George Clooney at his screen hogging worst.I won't however fault what is an otherwise entertaining film on the basis of one actor. It is overly an interesting and enjoyable film. It is not something which I would ever own, or even something I would go out of my way to watch. But nonetheless I think it has a unique appeal and is certainly something worth having seen at least once.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
278,mrkramer,Okay movie with great soundtrack,5,16 January 2001,"I've always liked the Coen brothers' films, with my favorites being Raising Arizona and Fargo. This one is stylistically good and filmed very well, with some fun over-the-top performances from George Clooney et al., but for some reason it didn't resonate with me on any emotional level. I found it ultimately fairly forgettable. In short, it's my least favorite of their films. I probably won't see it again. The soundtrack is wonderful though--I don't even like country/folk music as a rule, but it's stayed in my mind so I just had to go out and buy it! It's beautifully sung and has some wonderful American folk music on it.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"

280,jacob rosen,An Amiable Ramble,8,20 October 2001,"A surprisingly entertaining comedy from the Coen brothers, who attempt to place Homer's `Odyssey' in the Depression-era Deep South. Maybe because they spend so much time focusing on getting the retelling right there's very little of the cold condescension towards the characters that mars most of their other films. (Not that there's a whole lot of warmth either; the Coen brothers don't seem capable of empathizing with people and many of the characters are present only to serve as comic relief.) There's also a rhythm that makes the film a very pleasant ramble, abetted by T-Bone Burnett's bluesy score and Roger Deakins' dusty, deep woods photography. The three convicts who escape from a chain gang and wander in search of home and family are played by Tim Blake Nelson and John Turturro (both very likable) and are anchored by George Clooney (passable but he does try). The large cast also includes Coen stalwarts John Goodman (as the Cyclops), Holly Hunter and Charles Durning. The title is a typical Coen film school in-joke, referencing Preston Sturges' `Sullivan's Travels'.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"

I saw it twice in theatres in first run, then again on DVD, and many more times as it plays on cable.  The dialogue sparkles with eccentric turns of phrase (""the acme of foolishness"" for instance), and the sound and music are glorious.  The DVD commentary provides insight about color processes and other enhancements to create this visually ravishing film.  The classic story receives a fresh review, with more than a passing reference to Preston Sturges' great film ""Sullivan's Travels"".  If you've never seen that one, it's a must, especially after viewing 'O Brother, Where Art Thou?'","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
282,bill_golden,Clooney & Turturro head an entertaining cast,6,15 September 2005,"Entertaining if somewhat ultimately silly picaresque tale set in the rural South of the 1930's. George Clooney is the brainy member of a trio of escaped convicts whose unlikely and sometimes scarcely believable adventures comprise the storyline. The photography is wonderful, the characterizations generally very good. Along the way they become unexpected recording stars when their spontaneous performance at a rural radio station strikes a chord with listeners. For those who might doubt John Turturro's credibility as a rural hick, check out his performance here. Holly Hunter has a minor role as Clooney's wife who has told their kids he was dead. Charles Durning is a hoot as the Governor of Mississippi. One scene that struck me as somewhat strange was the Ku Klux Klan scenario toward the end of the film. Certainly worth watching for escapist fare, and you might be entertained by the music, too, as so many were.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
283,bradleyadita,"For America, this is cultural Kudzu.",8,3 November 2007,"Following Fargo, and The Big Lebowski, writer, director, producer team Ethan and Joel Coen created a film no one could have expected. Viewers will enjoy the performances of Clooney, Turturro, and Nelson. As implied, the cinematography is lush and CGI is skillfully interwoven into the decidedly analog time and place represented herein. Solid and memorable musical performance and soundtrack add an integral sonic dimension to this barnstormin' hoedown.Oh Brother, Where Art Thou? is nostalgic psychedelia. The story and scenes float as if suspended in a lava lamp, or in the calm aftermath of flooded river valley. The picture is ""show"", not ""tell"" (there is literally no ""telling"" in the film). The plot is steeped in thick Christian revelry, but it's literally basis, Homer's Odyssey, pre-dates the Gospels by hundreds of years. Again, its not a matter of complete comprehension, what you see is what you get what you want to see. The music group R.E.M. comes to mind, with their speaking-in-tongues folklore. For America, this is cultural Kudzu, for the Coen brothers, rococo. Trials and tribulations. Lush. An once the film is both frivolous, but then again profound. In Greil Marcus's book, The Shape of Things to Come, he begins by expounding the ideology of America as an ideal / idea. That can be applied to the film. Here is an American moment in a pseudo-mythology, anachronistic, a steam-punk history impossible possible.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"

Unfortunately, the best I can say for it is that it had a few clever scenes.But for the most part, I found it to be predictable, slowly paced and the writing was... well, smug is the only word that seems to fit.  It strives to be clever for the sake of being clever and the audience pays for it by having to sit through for little to no payoff.Sorry, I thought it was an ok film, but nowhere NEAR worthy of the hype it has received.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
285,lucaslw-93145,"A solid movie, though certainly not a 10",8,26 October 2020,"I watched this movie on recommendation of a reddit post calling it the best movie they had ever seen (in their opinion). It's a solid movie, delivers a few good laughs, a rotating crew of great, unique characters.For reasons I can't coherently articulate, this feels like the film Hail, Caesar! wishes it were. I think it's just because the Coen brothers have some visceral cinematic signature in all their films that I can't place. Any other parallels to draw between the two films would be solely placed in both Lead roles being played by George Clooney.Anyway, if there were two things to commend this film on, it would be the seesawing motif that juggles between religion, superstition, intellect, and coincidence and the musical choices. The Big Rock Candy Mountain is a perfect fit for the film. Like actually perfect, no exaggeration. It feels like the movie is sculpted around the song.Great solid movie, though I'd hardly put this as a top 10. This movie is a modern spin on The Odyssey (a parallel that flew over my head until it was pointed out by the same redditor) and is a wonderfully entertaining way to spend two hours.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"

I thought it was pretty obvious, but I am afraid not. Every episode is a copy of what happened in this old Greek tale: even the main character played by Geroge Clooney is named after Ulysses.The movie then becomes interesting because it is fun to recognize the transposition of the story to the South of the first part of the century.One bad thing though: Tim Blake and John Turturro sound perfectly southern but George Clooney, although acting quite decently, CANNOT act with a southern accent.Because of this, I give the movie only a 7.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"

Maybe it's the amount of hype a movie receives, both pre- and post-release, that influences me.  This was a kind of word-of-mouth sleeper, most of which I find delightful.  ""Fargo,"" on the other hand, is continually held out as ""one of the great classics of all time,"" but I found it absolutely pointless and unfunny.  Both movies seem to rely on quirky characters, yet the quirkiness works well in this one - you care what happens to these yutzes.  The various story lines gel at the end, and you realize you've seen an adventure with all the classic elements of great storytelling - a beginning, a middle, and an end that justifies it all.  The music is appropriately ""old-timey"" and darn good (did someone here complain that it had no ""mainstream appeal""??  Did you want the gravediggers to break out into a hip-hop number or something??) Just one other thing...did anyone notice the similarity between George Clooney's ""Ulysses"" and John Ratzenberger's ""Cliff Claven""?","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
288,Benjy,The Coen Brothers' Odyssey,9,19 September 2000,"Throughout their film career, the Coen Brothers have never disappointed, except at the box office. Whether this film will be a commercial success remains to be seen, I saw it the first weekend of release in the UK with only a small handful of other people. This is a moderately faithful retelling of Homer's Odyssey set in a depression hit South, complete with the Coen Brother's now obligatory fake plot. The script is a masterpiece of dialogue realistically creating the 30s yet referencing modern day issues. The acting is sublime, George Clooney is on top form, John Turturro is always good but there's also an excellent performance from relative newcomer Tim Blake Nelson. John Goodman shows up in a brilliant cameo as a bible salesman/thief/KKK member. Also add into this an excellent supporting cast and Holly Hunter to boot. O Brother contains without doubt the funniest Ku Klux Klan scene I've ever watched which should be required viewing for Klan members and activists alike to make them all realise how daft they look! A word too for the soundtrack, a mishmash of 30s blues and country. I'll be queueing up for the CD! The Coen brothers really are master story tellers, true artists in an industry full of artisans. Who cares if it's a commercial success? Hollywood probably will so for the sake of there being many many more Coen Bros. movies go and see it! You will not regret it.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"

So the main character (Clooney) likes to keep his hair pretty with pomade and hairnets. And a Mississippi chain gang ain't the place to spend 1929. Why doesn't some big time movie critic just say it: ""This is a lousy waste of time."" This movie proves that everyone likes a fat pay day for as little work as possible.A Mississippi chain gang is probably a more exciting and involving experience than this movie. Some good moments and a tongue in cheek performance by George Clooney rate it a 5/10 stars for me. Glad I got it on a 'rent one get one free' deal.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"

293,danindenver,Another great art film from the Coen Brothers!,10,26 January 2002,Never has a movie captured my attention so quickly.  Never before have I gone to see a movie during the first weekend of its release.  And I was NOT disappointed!  I've always said that a great movie has to have good music. Other reviewers have said that the music is the star of this movie.  I feel that the great cast outshines even the great music.  Point of note: this movie has the absolute BEST climactic scene of any movie - EVER!The DVD contains a fantastic music video.  It's almost like watching a miniature version of the movie.,"O Brother, Where Art Thou"
294,williamknott,Love it or Hate it,7,15 June 2001,"My favourite Coen Brothers film to date is the Big Lebowski.  I thought Fargo, their most acclaimed movie so far, was a waste of time.  And that's usually the way it is with their movies.  You either love 'em or hate 'em. But this time, with O Brother, I found that I don't love it or hate it; I just like it.  I give it a 7 out of 10 so far.  I say so far because I've only watched it once, and watching a Coen Brothers movie is like reading a Kafka short story---there's so much there that you can't pick up on all of it the first time.  Greater appreciation comes from repeated viewings. And some people will never really get it; it's not for the immediate-gratification crowd and never will be.  That said, having watched O Brother only once, my summary is this:  There's virtually no narrative to the story; it's just a bunch of stuff that happens.  Therefore it's not as engaging as could be had there been a stronger narrative pull, and some people will think it's boring; there are some slow parts.  But when it is funny, it's hilarious, especially George Clooney's character who cracked me up just about every time he opened his mouth.  At the moment I wouldn't put it up there with the Big Lebowski, but the laughs, when they come, are so strong that it easily worth the price of admission/rental.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
295,nankipoo,"O Brother, This is Excellent!",10,14 September 2001,"I am still kicking myself for not seeing this film in the theater when it first came out. Oh well, at least I had the good sense to catch up with it on my local pay-per-view cable channel about a month ago. I can honestly say that I've only been surprised by a movie a few times, and this is one of those times. I saw George Clooney in ""The Perfect Storm"", and thought he did a very good job in that film, but I wasn't prepared for what ""O Brother"" had in store! I've seen ""Raising Arizona"" and ""Fargo"", and am definitely a Coen fan, but OBWAT is in a league ALL BY ITSELF. It's spirit is simple and poetic, its actors are dead-on, its screenplay is virtually flawless, its cinematography gorgeous, and its soundtrack is one that with have you humming/singing/whistling for a long time after. ""Surreal"" is a word that comes to mind to describe many of the scenes. The escapees are 3 of the funniest characters you'll ever meet on film; Charles Durning as Gov. Pappy Lee O'Daniel makes me laugh just thinking about his portrayal, along with his ""advisors"" and his rotund son, Junior; and all of the other supporting characters make for a superb collection of contributors to this rare jewel. I replay my tape of it to the auditorium scene over and over, just to savor the exuberant return of ""The Soggy Bottom Boys"". If you haven't seen OBWAT, you're missing a treat. 10/10","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
296,Tommy N,"O Brothers, Thank You",10,5 January 2001,"Brilliant.How can a one make a movie that is not an original story, yet make it entirely original?I cannot believe people that negatively review creative filmmaking (Almost a non-existence in Hollywood) and tear this film to pieces. While the postives far outweigh the negatives, the Coen Brothers are an aquired taste that I have had since seeing Blood Simple years ago. Yes, I am a fan. I own all of their movies, and each is getting better and better.While many will see similarities in George Clooney's performance to Nicolas Cage's H.I. McDonough from Raising Arizona. The two are still fresh characters that don't brandish action and suspenseful characters and gimmicky plot to carry them.  John Goodman's Cyclops role is reminiscent of his character in Barton Fink. Even the brilliance of capturing the era was very reminiscent of Miller's Crossing, but in the end is a movie that stands very much on it's own, not unlike Fargo.What singles out this performace and is without doubt the film's best character is the music. Has there been a more astute soundtrack to depict a movie to it fullest in the last ten years? While not a fan of Satuday Night Fever, needless to say what the music did for that film. I think the closest comparison could be 2001 a Space Odyssey or maybe the Godfather.I can only hope that this trend of filmmaking continues for many years to come, making the experience of cinema the art form it should be.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
297,Tirdun,Surprising and Hilarious,9,7 August 2001,"I actually only watched OBWAT because the rental store gave my wife the wrong box (she wanted Pay it Forward), and was I ever happy about that. ""Oh Brother"" was funny, sweet, surprising and simply fun to watch.The only rough spots were George Clooney's occational over-acting (yes, the character was supposed to be melodramatic, but it grated at times) and a few times where I thought the director was spoon-feeding the audience information.These minor potholes did nothing to deter my amusement and surprise from the first scene to the last. The music was excellent (not only the theme song, but the entire score), the story was funny, the loose ties to the ""Odyssey"" were interesting, and I found myself rooting for the characters more than I have in a long time. A simple, effective movie that Hollywood should pay attention to. 9 out of 10.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
298,wnewman106,Coen Bros: Try Huckleberry Finn next.,9,30 March 2005,"I resisted seeing this movie because of George Clooney's political views, but I guess I'll have to learn to separate his movies from his politics. This movie is one of the best I've ever seen. George is great, John Turturro is great, and Tim Blake Nelson delivers a fantastic performance as Delmar. The blind guy at the radio station has his act down pat also. The Coen brothers should tackle a treatment of Huckleberry Finn next. Huck meets a cast of characters in the book who would fit in just fine in a Coen movie and the time and place of the book would give them ample scope to do their magic. I have never cared much for country music, but this movie caused me to buy the CD and I and my family have fallen in love with the music and the movie. Listen to what the KKK is chanting during their drill and see if you don't laugh.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
299,Michael Laing,Coen Classic,10,8 May 2001,"In the past I have been weary of the Coen Brothers films.  It cannot be denied that they are arguably the most talented film makers in Hollywood today, whilst also making some of the most annoying films of all time. Just look at the ending of the Big Lebowski.  The first time I watched O Brother I felt indifferent about it, but then I watched it again and loved it.  I have seen it several times since and the film keep growing on me.  George Cloony is great, and should have got nominated for an Oscar, as should have the film which was easily better in my opinion than Gladiator.  Not to mention the rest of the cast though would be a crime.  John Tueturro and Tim Blake Nelson are extremely good along side Cloony.  This to me is easily the best film the Coens have made so go see it.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
300,paul-kristensen,o brother where art thou,8,19 November 2010,"O Brother Where Art Thou is a great movie that is based off of the Odyssey. It is about three guys in a chain gang who escape from a prison work force to look for a treasure. They meet a blind prophet, a man who sold his soul to the devil to play the guitar, and a one-eyed bible salesman. This movie is full of humor and adventure. If you know the Odyssey, the movie gets better. The movie is a bit of a musical, but they don't just randomly burst into music. When they sing anything it is always live. Like ""Man of Constant Sorrows"" where it tells a bit about the characters and is a piece of the Odyssey and they are just singing to get money. So this creates a lot of concerts and singing congregations. Overall it is a very unique movie.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"

George Clooney, sometimes looking like Clark Gable, will not be nominated for any acting awards, but his role wasn't very demanding. The same might be said for Tim Blake Nelson although he seemed perfect for the role. This movie doesn't need a lot of analyzing. It was simply good, mindless fun. The soundtrack will have you slapping your knees and you'll be cheering when the Hogwallows reprise their hit song.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
303,stemage,"Not the best Coen movie, but one of the best of the year for sure!",10,22 October 2001,"I'm a Coen fan.  Just as a disclaimer.  I love everything about this movie except for a few small points.  The cinematography was breathtaking! Extremely reaslistic and optically orgasmic (just to be silly).  The use of yellow was very soothing and added an organic and antique feel to the entire movie.  The music is well chosen, the acting was choice (it was good to see Holly Hunter again), and the parallels with Homer were well placed but not hokey.  I was not too into the last 30 minutes of the movie.  It appeared to me that the Bros had a good hold on the movie until close to the end, and were at least coerced to make for a little more tangible Hollywood ending. Other than that, I would say this movie is a very enjoyable movie, one of the most ""enjoyable"" movies I've seen.  Very pleasing.  And I would say it's one to own.  It's nice to see a movie that appeals to so many different types of people as well.  My parents even loved it.  Great production...","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
304,nessking,What the...,3,12 November 2001,"I am sorry i really am. I just can't understand how anyone could enjoy this movie.

Figure it out - the most obvious one is KKK meeting. There a number of others either in cinematography or verbally. How many are there?? I believe I have spotted at least four others. I would be curious as to whether or not you would agree and I ask if you know the reason why there are that many references to the Wizard of Oz by the Coens. Regarding the music, it has a stand alone property based on the awards picked up at the Country Music awards and the Grammy for soundtrack. I would have to put this one ahead of many other Coen films simply because of all of the elements.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
307,geo-546-616925,My Hair!,7,15 July 2013,"Being a man who didn't enjoy ""No Country for Old Men"", I was quite skeptical watching this movie. To my pleasant surprise, OBWAT became one of the few films that were much better than anticipated.The Coen brothers did a good job on the story and scenario, while the subtle humour was without a doubt the best choice. The performance of the three protagonists was amazing, with Clooney and Nelson offering many hilarious moments. The music, playing a significant role in the plot, was really enjoyable.Perhaps the only disadvantage is that the action began too early, even though a longer duration could make the movie boring. What is more, the ending doesn't sticks with the rest of the film.I believe this film can appeal to any kind of cinephile and this makes it a great comedy!","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
308,brainybrailler,Funny & action-filled!,6,3 June 2006,"I was extremely hesitant to watch this movie when I learned it centered around a trio of chain-mates, 1 of whom escapes to go in search of treasure - I guessed I'd be torn between hoping they'd succeed in their quest and that they'd get recaptured and sent back to the prison farm. As it turns out, this was my reaction, but the film was actually better than I expected. The sheriff who chased them annoyed me greatly - I hated it every time ""It's the authorities"" was bellowed through the megaphone they carried around. I found Delmar's quotes and misunderstanding with everything that happened to be not only amusing but memorable. I also appreciated Pete's being more moral than Everett, but Everett himself I despised. He jeers both his mates when they choose to become baptized, claiming Pete is being as dull as Delmar (though it's hard to believe he really is a gruff wanted convict when George Clooney's acting fails and his voice reveals an OK man at ease behind the beard). Why Pete - if he was so bad-tempered - didn't snap at him to shut up or else beat him is beyond me. I'm also curious as to how Everett managed to get the heat taken off himself with simplistic sentences the average person could've responded to in a flash. Having stolen from Pete's cousin, Everett reminds him that Wash betrayed them to which Pete (obviously) responds with a reminder that this was before any of them had known this - to which Everett replies ""Only a fool tries to find logic in the human heart."" I loathed him for getting away with that, the slime-ball. The one soft spot he has is for the family he hopes to reunite with. Again, I was torn at whether to applaud his wife for wanting to leave him since he's a greedy, selfish, lying atheist, or hope that he won her back. We later learn that this in fact the reason he broke free, not for a ""treasure"" he made up - to the disgust of Delmar and especially Pete, who wrestles him. Another character I hated was the exceedingly rude Pappy O'Daniel - yeah, his son's a fool, but he treats him like dirt, not to mention everybody else. I could see Stokes had better taste - so I was more than a little surprised to see he belonged to the world's worst racist group, not that I had a better view of O'Daniel, even if he acquitted the Soggy Bottom Boys! I had a lot of trouble with how some things in this movie didn't add up: Delmar is supposed to be a fool, an idiot, yet some of what he says sounds decent, but it sharply contrasts to his imagining Pete has transformed into a toad, and there'll be an available wizard to reverse it. We never learn why Pete and Delmar were imprisoned - with Delmar's lack of brains, what the devil would he do intentionally knowing it led to prison? - so my hoping for their escape ran deeper than for the protagonist who has no morals. When I watched this, I hadn't been told this was a modernized version of The Odesy - but it wasn't hard to believe after seeing sirens. Still, this was the only thing that they seemed to have in common without a stretch. I know John Goodman's character was supposed to represent a cyclopes, but it was considerably stupid how he was a Rochefort-like character who pretty obviously wasn't a Bible salesman...If Everett is so smart, why didn't he pick up on this - and why did he choose to join Teague who was ""selling Bibles"", or curse God's name if he was an atheist?! SPOILERS AHEAD: The climax is terrific, and my view of Everett did a 180 when I saw him praying to survive if only to return to his family, admitting openly his turning away from God. Now my hatred was merely focused on the nemesis sheriff who refused to acknowledge his pardon. However, after the excitement's over and his companions note how his prayer must've been linked to the following event, he is instantly back to his atheist attitude, showing he's fickle and shallow. I hated him once more. (SPOILERS END.) I think this movie was OK, but not great. The score and soundtrack were OK, and the message was good. Maybe if details made more sense and Clooney's acting had been better (if that's possible - I've only seen 1 other film of his, Batman & Robin, & his acting was better here), this would've gotten a higher vote from me. But it's amusing to watch and enjoyable enough.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"

313,brentsoffcenter,Authentic southern culture of the depression era,8,20 August 2007,"One of the many reasons that this film and story was so successful, is that it offers a true depiction and glimpse of part of depression era life in the deep south. It also offers a taste of that culture, social mannerism and behavior that is very interesting. As opposed to sliding by with approximating the southern personality, the director was able to pinpoint and authenticate the southern character and mannerism almost perfectly. It shows that everyone in the production either did their research, or came from that region of the country originally.Homer's Oddessey was well adapted to the time and place depicted here. Just the right amount of pathos, irony, comedy, hard luck, and hard times give the principle characters something to really work with. And all of them have accomplished this in excellent fashion. John Turturro, particularly, has accomplished the quintessential down on his luck southern boy so well that he is almost the standard prototype of all time.In addition to showing a historically accurate picture of southern rural life in the 30's, the film also deals briefly with the then condition of the Ku Klux Clan and its psychotic cultural behavior. We see, in this adaption, that the average African American was not hated and hunted down by all white men, but only by a small percentage of fanatical tribesman. It also suggests in a more masked way, that the Clan's behavior was highly influenced by a gangster mentality. Many of the participants in this behavior would not behave that way on their own, but only when masked, and in a large group. Sort of like sheep. For the most part, people of all colors were willing to get along at that time. But like today, race relations still had a ways to go.Another treat was the depiction of the prison chain gang. Although not shown quite as hopeless and harsh as in Cool Hand Luke, Oh Brother does touch on the helplessness an inmate must feel, albeit done with a humorous slant. In this film, inmates are observed getting along well with each other, accepting their state of affairs, and working away without too much worry, frustration and fatigue. In real life, the chain gang was brutal, to the point where many of the inmates were on the verge of collapse almost everyday.Finally, since this observation is mostly about the depression era south, it was very enjoyable to experience the progress of the music of the region and the period, when the bluegrass style was in its infancy. The ""Soggy Bottom Boys"" were great, as was the audience they played for. This was simply another feature of this film that was done precisely as it was when the story takes place.For anyone who has not read the Oddyssey, or has not been in the deep south, or just wishes to enjoy a story well researched and well presented, then this is the story for him. It is an enjoyable film from start to finish, with flair and creativity to spare.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
314,elkabong-dd,An old favorite,10,17 July 2006,"Like most of the Coen brothers films, I think this one takes repeated viewings to really ""get it"". Yes, it's a comedy, but it's not some stupid Adam Sandler drivel. It's got depth. And while some here have said the characters lack depth, I must disagree! They are all quirky, but the lead, Ulyses Everet McGill - he had a depth of character that I think could even have carried him, as a character into other movies. Quirky - hell yeah - he's a candidate for the quirkiest character in any movie I've ever seen - but it works in this movie.I'd say as well, that this is the highest review I will ever give for a pro-Christian movie. :) You may have to read back a few reviews to see what I mean, but I do mean it.This is a movie about salvation. Plain and simple. While his cohorts gain salvation the easy way (southern baptism), Everet spends the whole movie EARNING his salvation, which he plainly gets at the end of the movie, as he asks for salvation in front of the devil (and his hound dog), and is granted said salvation in one of the strangest manners you are likely to see.But religious or not, I liked the characters in this movie, almost without fault. And the historical nature of seeing the likes of Tommy Johnson (the first rock guitarist), and George ""Baby Face"" Nelson (Reputed bank robber), just added a nice touch of 1930s.And I would be remiss if I didn't mention that this has to be, without a doubt, for me at least, the movie with the most memorable lines of all time. From ""I'll be a sonofabitch - Delmar's been saved"" to ""How's my hair"", or ""I don't want Fop - I'm a Dapper Dan man!"" - this movie has some memorable dialog.My highest rating, and a must-own DVD!","O Brother, Where Art Thou"

Oh, excuse me, inanity is considered the new sophistication! Well, lordy, lordy, lordy, lordy! George Clooney was passable, and does John Turturo demand a lobotomy before he signs a contract?

Anyway...It wasn't until I sat down to watch this movie that I learnt it was adapted from Homers epic poem... which is Brilliant in itself.  And what a terrific adaptation it was.  Every single character that were created were wonderful and the actors that portrayed them were brilliant.  George Clooney especially.  I really think he should stick to these off beat roles and stay far away from Batman and characters similar to that.The story itself is a tale of 3 somewhat stupid people caught in a huge amount of misadventures.  This leads to a bunch of hilarity and a story line that'll keep you watching and interested.Do I even have to mention the soundtrack?  I dont' think so, because if you seen it.. you know.

OBWAT is a celebration of Southern culture, especially the folk music, (which for no aparent reason almost made the film itself.George Clooney did the best perfomance of his life, as only the Coen's can bring out.

320,dae5,Overall disappointment from the usually solid Coen brothers.,4,24 November 2003,"This film is very well-shot; its images of the 1930s South are visual candy. And the eyes don't have all the fun: the soundtrack is even better, with ""The Man of Constant Sorrow"" only one of a dozen excellent tracks.But in terms of writing, directing, and acting, O Brother is a disappointment.  Structured loosely around Homer's Odyssey, the tone remains cynical and detached.  Clooney, awarded a Golden Globe for his starring role, should be applauded for trying something different, but his performance seems like it was pulled from an extended bit part.  His two dim buddies, likewise underdeveloped and played as two-dimensional buffoons, embody the sneering jests the Coen brothers make about Southern culture.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"

This movie is filled with great comedy and great music. The movie is based on Homer's The Odyssey. I'd personally would rather watch this adaptation of the book than read the book itself. The movie stars as George Clooney stars as Ulysses Everett McGill, John Tuturro stars as Pete and Tim Blake Nelson as dim witted Delmar O'Donnell. All of them play escaped convicts looking for the treasure that Everett had buried before going to jail. So when they bust out out of jail it is a whole new adventure waiting for them. When they record a song to get some cash they end up recording a hit song. Everyone is looking for these new found musicians but they are trying to hide from the law. This whole movie is filled with hilarious one liners from Clooney. The move also stars Holly Hunter, Charles Durning and John Goodman as a greedy bible salesman.

The performances of the three escaped convicts (Clooney, Tim Blake Nelson, John Turturro) are all deserving of recognition. I was particularly fond of Nelson's numbskull ""Delmar.""  The script was based on ""The Odyssey"" by Homer and there are multiple direct references to the epic.  Set in the Great Depression, however, the Coens creatively weave half-truth histories into the story.  (Partially) Real-life politicians, crooks, Klansmen, and musicians meet up with the trio as they make their way to a hidden fortune.Another remarkable achievement of this film is the incorporation of some great period music.  The soundtrack is one of the best to come out in recent memory.  Under the direction of the legendary T-Bone Burnett, ""O Brother"" resurrects the Bluegrass sounds reminiscent of Bill Monroe, Lester Flats and Earl Scruggs.  Ingeniously, the Coens fashioned the script to present the music as a major star of the film, and not just background garnish.  It's not far off to refer to this picture as a musical...or at least a parody of a musical.I'm generally a big fan of Coen films.  I remember thinking that Barton Fink was the most underrated film of its day.  I think that ""O Brother"" which was really snubbed by Oscar might be picking up the baton.  Run, don't walk, to the theater to see this film.  In my estimation, it's better than each of the 5 nominees for Best Picture this year.9.5 out of 10 stars.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
324,drin,What a piece of garbage.,1,24 February 2001,"I went to see this movie because a few of my friends said they liked it.There was about 35 people in the movie and not once did I hear a laugh. This movie I noticed is in IMDB top 250.I,for one,cannot figure that out.It just leads to believe that my friends and the people who voted this piece of garbage in the top 250 can no longer be trusted to tell me what to see.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
325,hammjp,A Southern Odyssey,9,4 June 2002,"Blind Oracle, Sirens, a Cyclops, an all powerful, hateful pursuer, and a long journey fraught with danger.  Yep, that's the Odyssey!  I read it. Hard to read, hard to stick with.  O Brother wasn't! I'll bet Homer wished he had had thought to seed it with ""old timey music"" and a sense of humor. I really liked this movie.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"

I truly didn't really know what to think of it.  But after some thinking, it truly was a good movie.  A few scenes really left lasting impressions (Clooney dancing).  The Coen Brothers truly do have brillant, twisted minds.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"

328,emccoy71,An Excellent movie with a dumb title,10,3 December 2002,"The first time I saw this movie I almost busted a gut from laughing.  The three main characters (Pete, Delmar, & Everett) bust out of a chain gang to go find buried loot.  Along the way they meet all types of strange characters.  From a blind ""seer"" pushing a hand cart, to the KKK, and other outlandish characters......The music in this film adds to the country setting.  A most enjoyable film. I highly recommend for those who enjoy a good laugh.Perhaps this movie would have had a better box office performance had the title been different.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
329,jandersonpwco,An instant classic,10,26 December 2002,"George Clooney cements his position as one of today's finest actors. This is one of those classic movies like Forrest Gump or It's a Wonderful Life that does not fit into any pre-defined category.  It is not a comedy, but it is hilarious.  It is not a drama, but it has a gripping storyline.  The main thing consistent with other classics is that you really care about the characters and what happens to them.  Full of ironic twists and turns. Great, great movie!","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
330,sarahcoleman-79272,In my Top 5 films - EVER,10,18 November 2018,"There is NOTHING I don't love about this film; beautiful atmosphere and cinematography, script, actors, music, it's all top notch. Watched this again last night for probably the 20th time, and I STILL find so much to love. Everett's flowery delivery cracks me up afresh every viewing. I'm a huge Coen brothers fan so it was fated to be up there with Fargo and The Big Lebowski, but this really is top of the heap.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
331,niel,A pretty good flick,7,25 January 2001,"Oh Brother is not a bad flick but the Coen Bros. Have to go a long way to top Fargo. See it for the sound track and the jokes. Though the audience I saw it with did not seem to even giggle at a single joke, like the one-eyed mask of John Goodman or the funny faces made by the two fellow travelers at the siren scene. This is a fun romp with some good stuff it just doesn't achieve greatness though it does comes close.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
332,Mourn-2,See it twice....,9,12 February 2001,"There are already 180+ reviews of this movie, so I wont waste your time with a lengthy treatise on the Coen Brothers' latest offering.  I will say this however:  I am a huge fan of all of their movies except for Raising Arizona, and I did walk out of the theater wondering if I had missed something in O Brother, Where Art Thou.  Fortunately, Barton Fink and The Big Lebowski had the same effect on me, so I thought the movie over for about a week and then I saw it again.  The fact is, this movie is such a flood of sights and sounds and has so much to think about and at which to laugh, there is simply no way to grasp it in one viewing.  See it once, give yourself a few days to let it sink in, then see it a second time.  This movie is flat out brilliant, it just takes two viewings to realize it.9.5/10","O Brother, Where Art Thou"

What a joy to see they can still really make a clean non vulgar....fun movie! George Clooney, I forgive you for making The Perfect Storm. And John Turturro, I love those teeth too! (See the DVD featurette for this comment) And Tim Blake Nelson, you are my new idol. I'm throwing away my Prozac.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
334,Tomrad,Puzzling...,7,22 April 2001,"O Brother, where art thou? seems to be a combination of two different movies.1. A hilarious ridiculous account of three escaped stumblebum convicts searching for mythical treasure2. A dull boring tedious short pastiche of southern governors and spin-doctors.The fact that the two stories collide at the end is really rather irrelevant.I loved the first movie. It was hilarious, clever, beautiful and starred George Clooney in fine form, John Turturro and the wonderful Tim Blake Nelson.The second movie was, as far as I could see (maybe I missed the joke) boring, pointless and unfunny. No disrespect to the actors, but to the writer.O brother is essentially a good film, if it were not for the sub-plot. Nevertheless, it is bearable the first time and the three leads almost make up for it entirely, making the incredible credible. Also the cinematography is beautiful and the plot quirks are worth an essay of praise in themselves.7 out of 10:Don't see it at the cinema, rent it on video, if only for the use of the fast-forward button.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
335,Markark,Best of a great lot,10,25 January 2001,"I liked this movie best of all the Coen brothers movies, and I think more than anything it was the soundtrack, which seemed to carry the characters, as well as us, through the story.  Plus, it takes place in that Coen brothers world that seems like reality, except nobody in it is like anybody you ever met.  Delmar is the key.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
336,konadv,"""Down by Law"" meets Bunuel",9,14 January 2001,"I was fascinated by this movie right from the opening scene. Then followed one memorable scene after another: hopping the train, the authorities, and one of the most erotic temptation scene in recent memory - though everybody keeps their clothes on. The movie is somewhat low-key and moderately paced, but combines the real with the surreal, the sad with the funny, and the sarcastic with the human touch and joy. The plot seems to play a secondary role here, but who cares? I must admit I was surprised to see Mr. Clooney actually ACT, and not jut being a pretty face. As for the ""Coen regulars"" - they're wonderful as ever.This is absolutely one of the Coens' greatest: Excellent acting, witty dialogues, great cinematography and a delicious soundtrack. could you ask for more?","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
337,GirlwonderReturns,"Pure, joyous entertainment",10,9 February 2001,"I really, really enjoyed this movie. It had been a long time since I'd left a movie theater feeling really good as a result of what I'd just watched, but such was the case with ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" I know a lot of critics didn't appreciate this film, saying, among other things, that it was silly, had a thin plot, or didn't make sense. It also seems that a lot of critics feel a film must have deep social relevance or a ""powerful"" message to be worthwhile. I myself do not feel this way. Movies, after all, were created as entertainment - a diversion, to make people forget about their own humdrum, sometimes dreary lives. Above all else, I think movies are meant to make people feel good. And what struck me most about ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" was the sense of joy - yes, joy - that permeated the entire film. The music was transcendent, and the performances floored me. With every role, George Clooney rises in my estimation; Everett was a glorious creature, and this was thanks largely to his portrayer. John Turturro, as far as I can recall, has never given a single bad performance; I count him among the most wonderful actors of his generation. And Tim Blake Nelson - always more active behind the camera than in front of it - was a pure delight, often stealing the show from the two cinematic giants he shared the spotlight with.But I keep returning to the joy. Perhaps there wasn't all that much to this movie, but I was transfixed nonetheless. I was behind Everett, Pete, and Delmar the whole way, just because they were so much fun to root for. I applaud Joel and Ethan Coen for making movies simply for the love of movies (I think this film, as much as any of their others, shows that to be the case) - in other words, for the joy of it. This was unquestionably the best film I have seen in a long time, and its simplicity, lack of pretense, and happy-go-lucky tone all played large parts in that. These days especially, pure whimsy should be cherished in the movies - after all, there's so little of it left.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
338,amazme3,What a waste of time!,2,21 July 2002,"Though I am not a Clooney fan, I saw this movie on the recommendation of this girl I met. What a joke of a film! The acting was average or overdone. The plot was pedestrian and predictable and boring. There was no clear direction in the movie. To compare this piece of garbage to Homer's Odyssey is ludicrous. I think the Odyssey has not been produced on film because of its complex structure and Hollywood's general ignorance of this classic epic. People who have not read the Odyssey will be mislead by the film's advertised similarities to Homer's timeless work. Unlike Homer's brilliance in content and presentation and organization of his long poem, this waste of viewer's time is a below-average attempt to be funny and entertaining. Clooney as usual exposes his average screen skills. I fail to find any redeeming features in this movie, and it deserves its failure at the box office. I give this flick a 2 of 10 score, and I am being generous!","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
339,shecrab,The ODDyssey of Humour,7,29 June 2001,"This is perhaps the strangest version of Homer's Odyssey I have ever seen. Set in the rural south of the 1930's, George Clooney plays the character who is just trying to get back home to his wife and daughters (The Wharvey Gals and Penny Wharvey, played by the three cutest kids I've ever seen on film and Holly Hunter,) who are about to be whisked away by their ""new daddy"". The odyssey is very loosely referred to throughout the film. John Goodman plays the ""cyclops"" (a one-eyed Bible salesman who mugs our hero and his friend,) the incredibly beautiful and erotic ""sirens"" are three luscious women washing clothes and singing by the stream, and there's even some divine intervention.  Through it all, George Clooney searches for ""hair pomade"",  manages to inadvertently cut a hit record, and finds himself in more ""tight spots"" than Wile E. Coyote.Although the plot seems completely far-fetched at times, the humour is sophisticated and subtle, even intellectual, and the whole thing works to present a film which will delight you, amuse you and have you talking for weeks afterward.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
340,greeny24,Great movie!,10,19 December 2001,"This movie was sooooooo good! It was hilarious! There are so many jokes that you can just watch the movie over and over and not get tired of it. John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson were awesome as Pete Hogwallop and Delmar! I love those guys! I love the adventures they went on, too. I definitely recommend this movie.Also, the music in this movie is terrific! I love singing along with all of the songs!","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
341,romeolima47,WUNDERBAR,10,9 July 2002,"Like the Coen brothers' other masterwork, Fargo, this film was extremely well written and directed.  Of course, HOMER did have a small hand in it. Hope you have the same response to this film as I did and that it enriches you as much as it did me.  Own this one; it will be considered a classic in the world of film.  The music is also fantastic.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
342,troodon,"Beautiful, but boring as hell.",1,8 August 2003,"The cinematography in this is excellent.  However, even an excellent painting wears thin if there's nothing to do but stare at it.  This was perhaps Clooney's best role, but that's not saying much.  He's still terrible, just slightly less so than usual.  The soundtrack is an utter headache... when it doesn't grate on your ears it puts you asleep.  The so-called ""comedy"" bits are way too subtle to get any entertainment out of it.  The plot makes no sense if you're not familiar with the Odyssey... and if you are, it just strikes you as a rediculous substitution.In its defense, any moment on the screen is good to look at... but the movie has no movement to it.  The action is slow, the comedy isn't funny, and the drama isn't dramatic.  Whatever this film was trying to be, it failed at being so.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
343,donny-31,"Even with many small flaws, this is one of my favorite comedies.",10,31 May 2005,"In order not to make anybody angry about the small complaints I have, let me say first: I love this film. I have a copy and I have watched it three times.This movie was shot in several Mississippi towns, and I live in one of them. My wife, Jonnie Wilson Harthcock, was in the movie, but her scenes were cut and re-shot. My darling was the (first) waitress who says ""Yes, Sir"" to George Clooney in the hotel where they first encounter John Goodman's character Big Dan. Jonnie had Alzheimer's. I tried to impress this upon the Casting Director, but she liked Jonnie's looks for that small part. But my poor dear could not remember not to look down at her feet when she hit her ""spot"" by the table. So they had to re-shoot it with somebody else.John Goodman lied to me, outside. How did he lie to me? He was a nice guy...knew I was Jonnie's husband...he said ""She did great. Really, she did great."" She did not do great, but John Goodman was very nice for no particular reason. Why was he even in this movie, I ask myself...so briefly and inconsequentially...probably has or had a contract with the Coens.For Mississippians there's a lot of funny stuff that nobody else would get. For instance, all the towns the characters mention are real towns, but very jumbled up. Many scenes were shot in my town of Yazoo City, but they called it Itta Bena, which is an actual small town up in the Delta, but not as scenic as Yazoo. The ""Woolworth's"" that Clooney gets thrown out of is the old Saxon Hardware (now a trendy, artsy furniture re-do place). Did you notice...the guy who throws Clooney out calls it ""Woolsworth."" Of course, there never was a Woolworth's there, but the people who own the building left the signs up until they wore out.I am a big fan of the Coen Bros. to begin with, so don't think I love this film just because they shot it in my town and my wife was supposed to be in it. It's extremely funny and well-done. The three principals do a great job of lip-syncing some terrific music, and Tim Blake Nelson is beyond hilarious.Here are my small complaints:First, Parchman Farm (which is way up in the Delta, nowhere near here) never had chain gangs busting rocks. We don't have any rocks around here, and especially not up at Parchman. And why would they be busting them? And on a dirt road? And why were the prisoners all totally out of rhythm with the music?Second, where did the guys get gophers to eat? We don't have any gophers...that's a Western rodent. I think the Coens chose gophers because what they boys COULD have caught and eaten - squirrels or rabbits - are too cute and popular for movie fans to see spitted, roasted and eaten in a comedy. ""Let's just say 'gophers'; nobody likes gophers.""Third, we don't have horned toads in Mississippi; those are Western toads. And the so-called ""toad"" that the fellows thought that Turturro's character was turned into by the siren was not even a toad; it was a frog.And finally, the film showed a lack of knowledge of Mississippi dancing, music and dialog of that era. Bluegrass is not Mississippi music, for instance; it is Kentucky music. Most of the accents were fictitious ""generic southern,"" not Mississippi at all, and the dancing was just slapstick.Still, a very entertaining movie. At OpinionSoup.com, we love it!","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
344,hallesq,Wife said kids' father was hit by a train - Blue Ruin homage?,8,20 October 2014,"I just saw this very good movie for the first time. I was inspired to watch it because in the reviews of my favorite new movie, Blue Ruin, there were several comparisons to the Coen Brothers' movies. Everett's wife in O Brother tells his kids that he was hit by a train. In Blue Ruin, when Ben first sees Dwight, he tells him a guy (someone, I guess, they had both known) got hit by a train. It's the best comic line in the movie, in my opinion. I would love to know if it was actually an homage to the Coen Brothers. Jeremy Saulnier, the Blue Ruin creator, and Macon Blair, his friend and the star in Blue Ruin, strike me as being very subtle and intelligent, and I would be surprised if the train reference wasn't their way of honoring the Coens.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
345,bn229,Baffling collection of disjointed inane vignettes,1,17 May 2017,"Perhaps the fact that this film has received such high ratings (in the IMDB) from so many reviewers is more a statement about their short attention span than it is about any (alleged) cinematic value of the film.I watched the film with a small group of friends, so I felt compelled to sit through the entire thing. Otherwise, I would have left. And while I have certainly turned off a few VHS / DVD films at home, I have never walked out of a cinema in the middle of a movie. (And that includes 'The Flintstones' film!) I can find absolutely nothing redeeming about this film.While the film does boast a nice array of well-known actors, none of them can do anything in this film to save it because the script is so damned awful. As another reviewer put it, it should be called ""Oh Cohesion, Where Art Thou?"" It is just a string of isolated vignettes that do not add up to any kind of unified plot. The only constant is the inanity.And while I have liked Clooney in a few things, his performances can rarely be described as multi-layered or nuanced. He tends toward the wooden, in my opinion, and here he is both wooden and flat.Of course, different strokes for different folks. So if you like it, then vive la différence! But I just don't see it.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
346,Xenoid,Stop making fun of the movie,9,13 January 2001,"I didn't really want to write a review about ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" It's been a while since I've written one for IMDB, but I was looking at some of the other comments written here and I felt nessesarry that I should state my opinion, and back it up.I just saw ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" and naturally I logged online, and went to give it a rating. I gave it a 9 out of 10. The movie is about a chain gang, who escapes under the leadership of Ulysses Everett McGill (George Clooney), who has told the others chained to him Pete and Delmar (John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson) that he is on his way to get 1.2 million dollars of buried ""treasure"" the film follows their crazy antics, the range of different people they meet, to even a run-in with the KKK. The movie has a few sideplots, Pappy O'Daniel (Charles Durning) the Governer running for re-election, and his opponent Homer Stokes (Wayne Duvall). These stories intertwine with that of our gang. The politics intertwine with a song the gang recorded to make a few bucks under the name of ""Soggy Bottom Boys,"" which unknown to the group is climbing high in popularity.
The movie is very clean, no poor tasteless jokes, you could almost call it an adventure movie. 3 adventurers and their humorous experiences. I highly recommend it, although it ends without a true resolve, it still is well written, well acted, and of course (I have to say it) well directed. I enjoyed this movie thoroughly, and reccomend it to all.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
347,berrin,A word for the non-U.S. audience,8,15 January 2001,"I truly enjoyed this movie, and I don't have much to add to the 94 comments before me. However, this is probably because I have been living in the USA for 5 years, and to a certain extent Americanized. If you are reading this review from a country other than USA, and if you have no familiarity with U.S. culture and history whatsoever, YOU HAVE LITTLE CHANCE OF ENJOYING THIS MOVIE. I made the mistake of recommending this movie to friends back home, and none so far seemed to enjoy it. In fact they had pretty harsh comments about it. There may be several reasons for this. The south accent is very difficult to understand to a foreigner. So most of them had to rely on the subtitles, which can seldom do justice to movies. In this movie this problem is more severe, because this is not an action film. This film is heavily based on verbal dialogue, and you have to understand it in English to get it. Even when you know enough English to decipher the dialogue, whether you will find it funny or not is likely a function of your familiarity with the U.S. culture. If you need someone to blame after seeing the movie and not enjoying it, just blame whoever is importing these films into your country and marketing them as the next big thing... So, you are hereby warned...","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
348,BadRon,"Good, but maybe just a little too uneven",7,20 March 2001,"We can all count on the Coen Brothers giving us an offbeat presentation, and this is no different. There were moments in this film where I felt like a smile was glued to my face. But every once in a while, a scene would come along and be completely disturbing (animals crushed under cars; KKK meetings). It came along too abruptly. Perhaps they were sticking to the formula in Homer's ""The Odyssey"" by juxtaposing the pleasant with the horror. But I always felt that Homer's book had more horror than pleasantness to it which made the transition more welcome. Still, it is an interesting film to sit through if only because you will not be able to predict what will follow from one scene to the next. And Clooney is very good here as well. His best work since ""Out Of Sight."" Now, if I want to smile all the way through, I'll listen to the outstanding soundtrack. GREAT MUSIC!!!","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
349,lrn79,not a coen great,7,17 August 2001,"I love the Coens humour, i love most of their movies, but this one left me saying ho-hum. It was enjoyable and querky but nothing special.

Redeeming moment; Clooney's performance (the Cary Grant of our time?)and the truly Coen-esque ending. 5/10","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
350,Barry Kruse,"Great, quirky, Coen fun",9,18 September 2000,"I'm a Yank living in England, so in a rare turn of events, we received this film, for some reason, before my home country did! (Usually, American films arrive here 2-6 months after they have in the States, which sucks!)This is a great ""little"" film, with extraordinary cinematography, a well-paced storyline (which vaguely recalls the Odyssey), and some wonderful performances. If there are any weaknesses at all, it might be the marginal and obvious overacting in some cases, and John Turturro, who I never enjoy, for some reason.Generally, though, the performances, especially Clooney's, are superb and wonderfully fun. The music, which certainly plays a large part in the story (You could call this film a musical, but don't let that put you off for a second...), is wonderful. Surprisingly, part of this film's greatest appeal is the incredible scenery!See this film, and I hope you enjoy it as much as I did. It's great, clean fun.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"

352,kurt120,i enjoyed the film,7,4 July 2001,"A very humorous movie based on Homer's Odyssey.Three depression era convicts escape their Mississippi chain gang on the promise of sharing $1 million in cash  left over from a bank job.As they head toward their big pay off, the convicts come across an assorted mysterious and quirky range of characters who sometimes confuse you but whose purpose knits together by the end.George Clooney (acting scarily like a young Jack Nicholson) stars as the hair cream obsessed escapee leader, while John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson feature as good ol'boys.Big bad John Goodman has a star turn as a cyclopic Bible salesman while Holly Hunter also appears.A fantastic film about friendship and redemption, among other things, with some surprisingly great country and western music that will have you laughing until the soggy bottomed end.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"

354,misterlei,George Clooney over-acting,6,30 August 2008,"I was disappointed when i watched this movie because i had heard so much about it. I found a couple of bits slightly funny but it seemed to drag a bit just after halfway through so that i fell asleep while watching it. For the first half hour George Clooney over-acted so that his character was just irritating. The dim-witted redneck boys were a racial stereotype, as were many of the characters - why was that acceptable while racially stereotyping an African-Caribbean man was self-consciously not? I think more could have been made of Don Goodman's character, which was larger than life and comical. I was intrigued at how the directors handled the race issue (since it was set in a historical context) & i think they just about passed but tackling it was just asking for trouble. I liked the music soundtrack. I didn't like the assumption that we can have sympathy for convicts especially Clooney's character, that made me feel uncomfortable. Some difficult moral aspects were tackled efficiently; others left a nasty taste in the mouth. A movie to see just to say you have seen it.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
355,Bill-181,Incredible - I mean it really taxes your credibility,1,28 February 2002,"This is one of the worst excuses for a movie that I have ever seen. It starts out showing a bunch of black guys on the chain gang, then shifts to 3 white guys, running down the road shackled and chained together, running fast enough to catch a freight train, despite the balls and chains linking them together. Then they come up on a man and his son who have no shirts or shoes, but, all of a sudden, the 3 fugitives are fully clothed and ready to go. Then, it goes downhill from there, featuring some of the most God-forsaken blue grass music ever perpetrated on mankind. The movie makes no sense, makes all Southerners look like Bozos, and taxes the credibility of anyone with a positive IQ. But, the public can't get enough of the ""music"". I rest my case.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
356,Bill-181,Miserable excuse for a movie,1,24 July 2002,"What a miserable excuse for a movie!! A claptrap full of tired old cliches, old songs, and parodies of Southern people, who, for the most part, are too dumb to even realize that they are being put on. I started making a list of unbelievable situations, but, when I got to 20, I quit. For example, preachers don't baptize just anyone who ambles into the ceremony. There is SOME preparation for the event, and it should not be taken lightly, the way this film does. The fact that this garbage has achieved so much commercial success is a sad testimony to just how far our society has descended in its downward spiral into oblivion.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
357,Raoul-16,in fine--if different--form again,9,2 January 2001,"the most astonishing thing to me, as i read over the comments on this film, is the incredible range of opinion it has elicited.  people seem to react with polar opposite feelings about the same aspects of this movie, which is enough to make me wonder sometimes if we all saw the same one, but without dwelling on complex matters of interpretation, i'll just stick to the film.  for whatever reason, i find myself drawn to films which drastically divide audiences in their reactions, and this one is no exception--i loved it and thought it was a nice comeback from the (to me) good-but-uneven ""The Big Lebowski.""  things that are pretty safe to assert about ""O Brother"":  1) it is the Coens' warmest, most sentimental film since ""The Hudsucker Proxy."" 2) it continues certain recurring themes/obsessions in the brothers' milieu, most particularly in that the plot revolves around crime (often rebelliously championing the ""little man"" against the power of big money) and that the film as a whole focuses very specifically on a particular time and place.  i have thought at times that the coens are doing a region-by-region survey of the greatness and lunacy of the united states, but maybe i am reading way too much into their work.  be that as it may, here is what i loved about ""O Brother"" as i saw it: it did a beautiful job re-creating the look and feel of a certain era that is long gone and forever lost to us now--the depression.  there is much that is terribly romantic about the 30's (and never more so than here), in particular the fact that hobos and bank robbers and even convicts were not widely looked upon as dangerous elements of society but rather sympathized with, sometimes even admired and immortalized in song and story as folk heroes.  hard luck times then had the effect of making people depend upon each other and trust each other more, while reviling big money and banks. by setting this film in that time and place and by making the heroes escaped convicts, the coens are being at least gently subversive toward our current ""gilded age"" of vast wealth for the privileged few of the technocracy and bread and circuses for the rest of us.  any doubt about this fact is erased by the use of harry mcclintock's ""big rock candy mountain"" over the opening credits, arguably the quintessential outlaw folk anthem of the time. that being said, the film becomes a generous and hearty parable about the triumph of the flawed but noble common man over the devious, manipulative, and corrupt forces that seek to exploit and control him.  if that is not your cup of tea, then this film may be deeply unsatisfying to you.  for me, though, it was occasion to stand up and cheer.  viva la coens!","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
358,Toad--,The Coens' best film ever.,10,13 January 2001,"Having gone through a horrid dry spell for good movies recently, which hit rock bottom when I found myself, out of desperation, watching Vertical Limit, the Coen Brothers have come through once again, and have they ever.Let me start by stating that I'm biased - about 4 months ago I fell in with a few fellows playing old time music, so it's been on my mind lately. And what made this movie for me was definitely the music: The obvious hit is the Soggy Bottom Boys doing I Am A Man of Constant Sorrow, but the high points for me were the baptists singing Down to the River to Pray, The Siren Song, and Ralph Stanley providing the voice for O Death. The presence of Jerry Douglas on dobro in a few scenes ain't too shabby neither. For a fan of old time/mountain music, this movie is like a shot of heroin - you will be back again and again.But even without the music, the movie features that Coen Bros touch, a little bit odd without descending into overt weirdness, and somehow true to life - there were some truly hilarious moments, and moments of such beauty that I was shaken.I have only one complaint that I can make about this movie, and it's a petty one: during some of the musical numbers, you could clearly hear instruments being played that weren't being ""lipsynced"" onscreen, and sometimes the lipsyncing was a bit off. However, that didn't bother me enough to keep me from giving this flick a well-deserved 10.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
359,majeet,"Brilliantly heartwarming, glowing",10,26 April 2001,"This movie is like being in love...you can't stop smiling. The ingenious Coens have made another sweetheart of a film. Usually, when I leave a movie this happy, it's a love story. This is a kind of goofy buddy movie with charming, unexpected performances from everybody. Three convicts escape, have meeting with fortune teller/seer, make a record, get caught, escape, meet a famous bank robber, meet beautiful women, get caught, escape (and each escape is more poetic than the last), discover that their treasure has been betrayed, become a famous singing group (and they don't even know it)by virtue of their recording...and on and on. This film is fascinating, funny, freedom loving, and fine. The director's vision with perfectionist cinematography flood the audience with golden images, creating a nimbus of timeless radiance.But wait! There is more! The Music. So much fun and expertly done. I have new laugh lines on my face. I almost don't mind.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
360,dougpaz,"Wow, what a ride!",8,14 July 2001,"I really had no idea what I was in for with this inappropriately named film. I had heard that the music was great but that was like saying that the Titanic ran into a little ice.  Clooney, Turturro and Nelson were comedic kings and the Cohens rivaled their ""Fargo"" for regional humor.  The cinematography was beautiful, the story just funny enough, and I sang the songs in my head for days afterward.  It was a real injustice that this film was not nominated as best film among the Oscar set and just shows how little they really know. I was really impressed at a previously unseen side of George Clooney and will see this film again and again. (You have to just to catch all of the hidden chucklers!)","O Brother, Where Art Thou"

I dont know why, but I just had this false idea of what it would be. I guess I thought it would be more serious or something. In either case, I was happy with what I saw! First of all George Clooney plays a character I have never seen in him before. I never could picture him being funny or anything, because all of the roles I have seen him in hes pretty serious. I thought he did a great job as did everyone else. This movie was funny and very well made! I suggest anyone see it! (I personally dont think you need any prior Odyssey knowledge to get it...)9/10!","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
362,kimpham54,feel good,9,12 July 2002,"SPOILERS right from the beginning i knew i would love this movie.  i was right. it was not exactly artistic, but it sure did have some of its components.  the symbolism in the movie was so beautiful. first the filtered colours added a nice, old-fashioned southern effect. when i was watching the movie i really tried to find any deep greens, blues and reds, but i really couldn't find any...they were all drained of their colour.  adding all these images like butterflies around delmar, sirens, incorporating all these characters of Homer's Odyssey in such a creative yet more realistic manner made the movie quite charming. umm..acting was quite good. george clooney did sound like a boisterous know-it-all, and i think it comes naturally to him. all in all i love this movie! the music was classic! 8.5/10","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
363,ubbu2002,Great Movie!!!,9,25 August 2002,"If you're young at heart, you'll find this a very entertaining and surprising film.  Yes, there are many plot twists and funny scenes.  George Clooney does a great job with his role.  Bottom line, the story is original. It is set in Mississippi, where three prisoners escape in search of buried treasure.  What happens next? Well, you can find out for yourself. Oh, and the music is just awesome.  Overall, wonderful movie in all aspects.  I give it at least a 9/10.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
364,jgreenhood,Did you like Homer's the Odyssey?,10,13 February 2006,I thought this movie was great! I saw this when it came out in the theaters so I do not remember all the details. I remember it being based on Homer's tale on Odysseus. Names places and events are changed but you can still see the resemblance to the tale. I found it funny how they would get themselves into trouble and how they would get themselves out of it. I really enjoyed this version of modernized old tales much better than the Romeo and Juliet with Clair Danes.I will agree that in some parts of the tale it does get a little to silly at times but all in all it is a great adventure with some big name actors.,"O Brother, Where Art Thou"
365,dhughbnks,Smart idea not well executed,7,15 August 2019,"This movie has enough star power to create an enjoyable film, but it has underdeveloped characters and a bogged down script. The Coen brothers make it an enjoyable film but not something to watch repeatedly.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
366,Attila-2,Just plain boring -- and that's the best part,1,31 January 2002,"This is one of those movies that everyone who failed Lit 101 thinks is great because its boring and they can't understand it, just like they found all those classical pieces they read and never understood. Well, just because it's boring and you can't understand it doesn't make it good. It is, in fact, a genuinely awful film that claims to be based on the Odyssey (by Homer). Right, just like Charlie Manson is a Christ figure. One bright spot: the movie is perfect for George Clooney -- it's so bad, one hardly notices that he, as usual, displays no acting talent.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
367,KarlMaldensNose,Pretty darn good,10,9 October 2001,"Having seen most of the Coen Brothers previous films I expected something different and slighty off centre. OBWAT is certainly those things, but it also has a heart as big as..well..as big as Mississippi. It is one of the most plainly enjoyable movies to have come out in recent times, intelligent, well-crafted, clever and superbly acted.Characters are delivered in their myriad shades by a group of marvellous actors. George Clooney winning me over completely with his Clark Gable-ish looks and character. Having only ever seen him in Three Kings and his Thin Red Line cameo, I am now a fan. More comedy please George.John Tuturro and Tim Blake Nelson ably assist, especially Nelson. If ever ""The Simpsons"" is made into a movie then he must be a natural to play Cletus the slack-jawed yokel. I don't think there is a performance that falls short of excellent from the entire cast. My special favorite is Stephen Root as the blind Radio Station Man.Great old-timey music, a jiggy type dance by Clooney that I am trying to learn, and a feel of depression era southern US enhanced by sepia-like photography make this the best movie I've see  so far this century. The only drawback to the film is that it has almost sent me broke buying the soundtrack, the DVD and a DVD player to play it on....it's THAT good!","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
368,TommyTwista,Poetry,7,19 April 2002,"I was very pleasantly surprised by this film. George Clooney was superb, showing a comic side that is usually masked behind the stereotypical Hollywood leading man machismo.

369,mooncat82,Laughed out loud at George,7,25 December 2001,"This wasn't the best film I ever saw, but there were components to it, that I enjoyed completely.  The soundtrack is most excellent, especially for those of us who are lovers of traditional and bluegrass music.  George Clooney was the funniest..many of the scenes cracked me up.  It was a compelling, light hearted rendition of the Odessey..Much fun was had by all.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
370,Mystery-Tramp,Wonderful,9,2 September 2001,"I love the Coen Brothers' movies -- The Hudsucker Proxy and Raising Arizona are two of my favorites. They seem to be able to create a movie I've never seen before. Here, the story of Everett, Pete and Delmar may be taken from Homer's Odyssey, but the three are lovingly original as they travel through Mississippi during the Depression.Clooney has become one of my favorite actors. He was great in Three Kings and The Peacemaker. He even made a respectable Batman. He's great here, too.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
371,wgreid,Delightful laugh out loud performances !,9,10 September 2001,"After a summer of trivial fair (Almost everything) and an unusual number of movies with incredibly unsatisfying endings (Under Suspicion, The Pledge), this is a delightful comedy. The music is wonderful, the performances are exceptional (especially a surprising Clooney), and the comedy is laugh out loud.  The Cohen Brothers are brilliant movie makers.  If your only going to watch one movie this year this is the one to pick up.  How did this get so over looked at awards time ??? Brilliant !!","O Brother, Where Art Thou"

373,I_actually_am_sam,A Collection of Comedy Sketches,5,26 August 2014,"This the Coen's weakest movie that I've seen. It's not really a movie in the traditional sense, more like a series of sketches strung together rather tenuously. What makes it work is the immense likability of the 3 leads and some genuinely hilarious moments. What doesn't is its length and the broken nature of the plot. You could leave during the screening, return in 10 minutes and it really wouldn't matter. Perhaps if I'd seen this before some the Coens' more accomplished recent films I wouldn't have felt so let down. The scenarios that our 3 protagonists find themselves in grow more surreal and ridiculous as the film progresses, and then, bizarrely, for the last half an hour it's extended into a kind of boring melodrama before fading out with a whimper.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
374,Phoeniloculus,15 years later and still one of the best films,10,16 February 2015,"I'm rather young and haven't seen as much films as other film buffs out there, but I can't help but to think that this is one of the best films I've seen. I first watched this back in 2010 or 2011 and O Brother Where Art Thou still doesn't get old to me. For starters, they couldn't have chosen a better cast. It's hard to believe how amazing George Clooney's acting was. On top of that the storyline is phenomenal. How they were able to take an old story ""The Odyssey"", (one of my favorite Homer stories) and weave it into a Southern tale is seriously amazing. It's very believable.The soundtrack is one of the best music scores I've heard. I'm very hard to impress with folk or country music, mainly because I'm not exactly into the genre, but I can say that I was very impressed with the soundtrack and thought it couldn't be any better or worse.If you've never watched this film and are only reading reviews before thinking about watching it, stop reading now and watch the film already. You will not regret it. In fact, you'll thank most of us for writing about how great the film is.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
375,kerimakdogankp,Damn! We're in a tight spot,7,1 December 2017,"This is a Coen brothers product. I am talking Fargo, True Grit, No Country For Old Men and the list goes like that. This two is two of the best in the market. They put their signature in this movie to. Well written. The story is really good. Along their journey lots of weird things happening, bad luck and good luck. The acting is also really good. Well, despite all of this good sides, movie doesn't brings any emotions. At least for me. Even though, whit the good acting and good music you will enjoy the film.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
376,Spiner-2,Not your typical movie,9,3 July 2001,"I wasn't sure what to expect from ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" Homer's Odyssey set in the deep South during the Great Depression? A premise like that screams ""arty film,"" and an ""arty film"" usually equates to ""bad film."" Look no further than ""The Avengers"" to see a what I mean. On the other hand, it was the product of the Coen brothers, and I was quite entertained by ""The Hudsucker Proxy,"" so I thought I might like it. And if anyone can pull off an ""arty film,"" it's the Coen brothers.The story revolves around chiefly around three men who escape from a chain gang and rush to collect a hidden treasure before the place where it is hidden is flooded by a dam project. Along the way, they have a variety of interesting and amusing experiences.George Clooney plays the head convict, Ulysses Everett McGill, a man obsessed with having perfectly slicked-back hair (with nothing less than ""Dapper Dan"" hair gel), to the point of wearing a hair net while sleeping. He is accompanied by the rather dull (mentally) Pete Hogwallop (John Turturro) and the even duller Delmar O'Donnell (Tim Blake Nelson). Their on-screen exploits are, to say the least, hilarious.One of the funniest parts is how Ulysses, as described in one review, ""manages to pull ten dollar words from a five-cent brain."" My favorite scene was when the three cons, still chained together, attempt to hop a moving train. Ulysses hops on and faces a group of hobos. As the second convict climbs aboard, Ulysses says, ""Any of you boys smithies? Or, if not smithies per se, were you otherwise trained in the metallurgic arts before straitened circumstances forced you into a life of aimless wanderin'?"" During this, the last con trips and falls while trying to board the train, dragging the other two off with him.The cinematography is, as usual, gorgeous, and the music compliments the story and location nicely. Particularly good was the number performed by the three convicts in the story to earn some extra money.The storyline does wander somewhat, but, considering the topic, it's actually rather appropriate! If you like other movies produced by the Coen brothers, you'll definitely like this.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
377,lucifergary,Orgasmically enjoyable soundtrack,8,23 April 2001,"The movie is good, but the soundtrack is semen-hopping fantastic!  You'll need plenty of tissue paper for this one guys.  From Big Rock Candy Mountains to In the Jailhouse Now, you'll experience one long excruciatingly-pleasurable climax.  The line between pain and pleasure will increasingly become blurred as you listen to this enchanting early 20th Century folk-gospel hoe-down.  Don't walk, run to your nearest record store. You'll never need another blow-up doll again!","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
378,danhicks,The Coen Brothers' best,9,18 February 2001,"I think this is the Coen Brothers' best movie to date.  Like the others it's somewhat rambling and episodic, leaving the viewer intentionally a bit confused as to what's going on, but that style serves them well.The cinematography is exceptional, using the camera to great effect without having it become intrusive.I never really liked George Clooney in ER -- his performances always seemed a bit wooden and self-serving there -- but in his role as Ulysses Everett McGill he's exceptional, projecting precisely the personality of a likeable guy who is part schemer and part deer caught in the headlights.  Turturro and Nelson, as his two not-too-bright sidekicks, are perfect in their roles as well.The music is exceptional.  It's hard to believe that today's audiences would go for 30s country music, but it works and it's GOOD.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
379,Andy - Cardiff,Good film but not the Coens at their best.,7,22 September 2000,"This film is not of the same class as 'The Big Lebowski' or 'Fargo'. However, the period recreations are excellent and the lead performances, especially John Turturro's. The link with Homer is interesting but the film tends to drone on and I don't feel caught up in the usual Coen brothers intrigue.An excellent musical soundtrack carries the film along, but sometimes the displaced and surreal personal viewpoints that the Coen brothers project in their films fails to captivate in this instance. Hilarious KKK choreography, but the 'irony' of Everett being an astute social commentator as well as a convict has become an annoying cliche in Coen movies, where the most unlikely people talk in sociological language i.e. Lazar in 'Miller's Crossing'. I was slightly disappointed with this movie but with the Coens another masterpiece may be around the corner. The cinema would be a duller place without them.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"

But it is a series of events which came across as being well stitched together. Congratulations to the film makers for doing a great job of that.It's a comedy, and a good one at that. It does take a little while to get into (assuming it is a film that you can personally get into, it might not suit everyone!), but once you've got the theme sorted out you really start to chuckle at the events that take place.I was glad I sat down to watch this one, and I can see me watching it again in due course.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"

384,Rob-210,Far from a classic Coen Brothers movie,7,3 October 2000,"All a matter of opinion of course, but I hated this movie - maybe I enjoyed Fargo and,especially, The Big Lebowski too much but I found the humour childish, the acting average - apart from George Clooney who was obviously having a lot of fun - and the music ghastly. Trouble was, I saw O Brother in Edinburgh about an hour after watching "" Things You Can Tell Just By Looking At Her "" which is one of the best movies I've seen in years, so maybe this unfairly coloured my view.  I can't stomach the idea of sitting through the tedious ""odyssey"" again so I'll never know.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"

Because whence came those lines, the film, ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" Based on Homer's Odyssey, this delightful frolic takes our Depression-era adventurers, led by Ulysses Everett McGill, from the railroad to the recording studio, from the chain gang to river of redemption.""My hair!""Everett (played by George Clooney, doing a wicked Clark Gable imitation) leads his fellow prisoners, Pete (John Turturro) and Delmar (the incredible Tim Blake Nelson) through the fields and furrows of the Deep South. In the course of their travels, they meet a blind prophet; Pete's horse-eating turncoat cousin; a talented black guitarist (Chris Thomas King) standing at the crossroads (having sold his soul to the devil in order to learn to play the guitar; hmmm, wasn't there a movie called ""Crossroads"" that had to do with  oh, never mind); a blind radio station owner who starts the boys on their singing career; some incredibly hot babes (read: Sirens) who make off with Pete (""They loved him up and turned him into a horny-toad!""); and a one-eyed gluttonous con man (read: Cyclops) essayed by John Goodman.""Cow killer!""Oh, yes, did I mention George ""Babyface"" Nelson, who machine-guns cows, then makes off with a bundle in a bank robbery but gets depressed and leaves the loot with the boys? And Pappy O'Daniel, the fussin'-cussin' politician? Then there's the encounter with the excruciating little Wharvy Gals and their baby-factory mother (Holly Hunter) who longs for a ""bona fide"" suitor to take care of her and her girls. And a turn with the KKK, which constitutes a hysterical takeoff on the march of the Wicked Witch's guards in ""The Wizard of Oz.""""I don't want 'Fop'  I'm a 'Dapper Dan' man!""Through it all we have Everett's obsession with pomade and hairnets, Delmar's salvation and philosophical acceptance of the world around him (shades of ""Forest Gump"" here) and Pete's hapless encounter that leads to betrayal. And the mysterious lawman with the bloodhound (Daniel von Bargen) who shows up in the worst places at the worst times.Most of the acting is first rate (except for the Wharvy gals) and the story, aside from a little rough language, is mesmerizing. (The lack of Academy Award nominations for ""O Brother"" was disappointing. Tim Blake Nelson's omission was particularly puzzling.) The one sour note is the cruelty to animals - though digitized and computerized, it still looks all too real.However, the real star of ""O Brother"" is T-Bone Burnett, the genius producer (brilliant architect of Bruce Cockburn's career) who crafted the soundtrack. He has pulled together some of Nashville's finest - including my favorite killer gospel group, The Fairfield Four (appearing as singing gravediggers). The music weaves through the story to make a rich and colorful tapestry, so tightly woven that one can barely imagine one without the other. The main theme, ""Man of Constant Sorrow,"" turns up in two vocal and two instrumental versions, all of which rock (though the radio station version, with its awesome guitar, is my favorite). I couldn't wait to buy the soundtrack to this film. And I can't wait for the film to come out on video, so I can sit and watch it over and over again, reciting my favorite lines.

They do it again with O Brother (will someone explain the title to me?).The story is silly and fun and keeps a smile on your face. The music is a much needed cinematic nod to a unique American sound that has been lost to so many of us. The tunes fit the story perfectly and lift the movie to a level of pure enjoyment.There are lots of moments in this film that will leave you chuckling long after you see it: The Siren scene; Delmar's comment ""Good ole George, right back on top again"" as a wildly manic Babyface Nelson is lead to his execution; the upside down bloodhound drifting by in the flood; the blind radio station owner (talk about great character actors); Holly Hunter not needing to hide her accent for the second time in her career; and on and on and on.Finally, Tim Blake Nelson is incredible as the sweet half-wit Delmar. Clooney and Turturro seem like easy choices for the Brothers Coen, and both do great work here. But how on earth did they find Nelson? He's perfect as Delmar, and nearly steals the movie. Sings a pretty mean rendition of ""In the Jail House Now"" to boot. Who knew?","O Brother, Where Art Thou"

Half of the audience walked out on the movie after the first 15 minutes.  Most likely because they were bored.

390,trilobee,"Oh yes, this oozes charm...",7,22 September 2000,"Perhaps a little too much, in fact.  It's fun, it's sweet, it's sometimes inspired, the bleached, golden landscapes owe a lot to a nostalgia that for a non-American audience is instantly recognizable and therefore (I assume) pays a debt to fiction than historical reality, the music is great (clocking both Alan Lomax recordings from the period & intelligent country greats like Gillian Welch, Alison Krauss & Emmy-Lou Harris in the sirens' song) and the performances are fine: Holly Hunter is never less than a delight.  But 'O Brother, Where Art Thou' displays very little of the sardonic humour of 'Fargo' or 'Raising Arizona', or the technical perfection of the comedy in 'The Big Lebowski' (surely one of the absolute best comedies of the last decade).  This film is a lift, but it's a purely temporary one.
Go see, though, it might not be up to their previous standard but it's still a Coen brothers movie.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
391,filmdrift,"'O Brother' Is Enjoyable, Entertaining & Quirky",7,21 August 2001,"The Coen brothers have created another enjoyable film.  While O Brother, Where Art Thou?' is definitely not their greatest work, it is certainly enjoyable, and is likely better than 70% of the movies being released today.Loosely based on Homer's epic poem, The Odyssey', O Brother' is the story of three inmates who've escaped from a 1920's prison chain gang in Mississippi.  They're running from the law and soon meet up with several adventures as they try to regain a million stolen dollars hidden nearby.Despite O, Brother's' origins in the classics, the movie is actually rather shallow.  There's not a lot of character development, and the plot, while entertaining, is somewhat thin.  O, Brother' did not set out to change the world or to tackle any important social issues.  But what seems to make this movie enjoyable is a fun script combined with good old-fashioned movie making--along with a variation of non-standard filmmaking techniques.  The Coens use music, and lots of it, to help move the movie along.  I was surprised to hear full versions of well-done folk and gospel songs.  The soundtrack for this movie is wonderful, and worth a separate purchase if you like folk or acoustic music.  Additionally, the movie's cinematography is effective.  Hues of yellow and brown fill many of the scenes, and it is fitting.  The colors and scenery effectively place us in a dusty 1920's Mississippi setting.  The Coens also cleverly vary the pace of the film. Slow deliberate moments are followed by well-paced action sequences.  It has the effect of luring you into a scene, and then cranking things up again with a new adventure.  Some may think that scenes are ill placed or do not fit well with the rest of the film.  But to me, this is the movie's strength. . . a quirkiness.  (This is not standard Hollywood fare.)The acting was fine.  I wouldn't expect any awards here due to the fact that the characters were not written with any real depth.  But both Tim Blake Nelson and John Turturro are hilarious as sidekicks to George Clooney. Their characters and accents couldn't be goofier.O Brother, Where Art Thou?' is not a great movie.  But it has enough fun, and enough innovation, to entertain and impress.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
392,adam1117,"That old, weird America",10,5 March 2001,"Reactions to this movie can typically be cut into two groups. Those who love it, and those who just don't understand what's going on. While such a requirement may keep a film from being accessible, to appreciate this movie, you have to know where it's coming from. Forget Homer, what you really need is an understanding of American folk and bluegrass music. This movie is a screwball comedy set in the land where all those bizarre old ballads came from, what Greil Marcus calls ""That old, weird America."" (other movies that have been set there include ""Night of the Hunter"" and ""Housekeeping."") This movie uses folk more effectively than any movie since ""Bound for Glory,"" and maybe more improves on even that. If you saw the movie and didn't understand it, but would like to understand why so many people are calling it a masterpiece, you should start by reading ""Mystery Train"" and ""Invisible Republic"" by Greil Marcus, then listen to some of Harry Smith's Anthology of American Folk Music, or at least some Stanley Brothers. Get a basic understanding of that, and you'll see why this movie is so brilliant.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
393,Albicastro,The Coen Brothers' finest film,9,4 June 2002,"While it may not be the most profound movie ever made, ""O Brother"" exudes a cheerful, uncomplicated spirit that no other film can match.  Apart from introducing a great deal of beautiful music, the Coen brothers have managed to tell a pleasant, whimsical, and ultimately touching story which is no less than perfect after its own fashion.  If you want a movie that makes you think and feel deeply, than it might be better to give this one a miss, but if you simply want to smile and laugh and feel better about the world, ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" fits the bill.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"

395,pauldan,Exceptionally Entertaining,9,22 June 2001,"I'll start by saying I love Coen brothers' movies.  Don't think I've seen all of their movies, but certainly most of them.  This one is SO entertaining.  The three main characters are extremely well played and likeable.  Tim Blake Nelson was the only one of the three with whom I was not familiar, and naturally, his role turned out to be one of the funniest. Turturro is like a chameleon in each of his movies, he just becomes who he is playing.  Not many stars can make the leap from TV to the big screen, but it looks like George Clooney may have made a successful leap.  Great dialogue and humor and good ole down home music.  Gotta see this one.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
396,oldbollweevil,I'm right here.,10,3 July 2001,"First off, if you haven't seen the old movie Sullivan's Travels, try toscare up a copy before watching this.  There's a real connection,and being aware of it just makes your appreciation of this moviethat much deeper.This should have gotten the Oscar for Best Picture last year.  Andafter giving it to this film, they should have stopped giving it forabout ten years.  It's that good.I love everything the Coen brothers have done, but this filmtranscends.  It's the best film I've seen in years.  It just may be theGreat American Novel.  High school English teachers say HuckFinn is, but it was too early:  America hadn't happened yet.  Highschool English teachers say Huck Finn was based on theOdyssey just like this film is.It's very easy for me to wax mystical about this film.  It's a mysticalfilm.  By setting it in a mythical version of Mississippi--a land thatexists in its purest form in old country blues and protobluegrasssongs--the Coens have tapped into the motherlode, the jugularvein of American myth.  This is the real America--the absurdity, thecruelty, the violence, the beauty, the deceit, the Dapper Dan.  Thisis the best America--the America that gave birth to Robert Johnsonand the Carter family.  Critics used to say that the Coen brothers were technically brilliantand emotionally cold filmmakers.  I never understood that and I getit even less now:  this movie has more heart, more passion andlove and spirit, than just about anything else I can think of. 
Perfect performances (George Clooney gives us the ride of hislife), breathtakingly beautiful cinematography, and the bestsoundtrack maybe ever.  Mark Twain would be proud.  10/10","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
397,woodybrown20,A waste of time,1,7 August 2001,"O Brother, Where Art Thou? has to be one of the most dull, confused and laughable movies I've ever had the misfortune to see.  It is awful.  It follows three escaped prisoners in stripy costumes, getting into one misadventure after another. It is very distressing to see the Coen brothers make such a bad movie.  I absolutely love 'Fargo', and 'The Big Lebowski' is pretty good, but please, don't bother renting this.  You'll only be disappointed by it.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"

Others have said it's a film that can be watched over and over. That's very true. For those that just don't get it, or harp on about the Homers Odyssey tie in, I really think you've gone to see the film without an open mind. I never read a thing about the movie before I saw it except it was a Coen Bros film. That's all I needed to know. Millers Crossing, Raising Arizona, Barton Fink, Fargo..etc etc. Have any other filmmakers turned out so many classics in such a short space of time ?

Then after a funny western ballad the rodomontade line came out that read Based on Homer's Odysseys. It really made some sense on that. The Sirens, they are, er, they are beautiful. And the Cyclops, er, he is really strong. It is funny that in Homer's epic Ulysses was cursed by Poseidon, but in this film those guys was finally saved by a flood. As well as Ulysses was smote hip and thigh while Homer's Odysseus killed all those suitors heroically. Yes, a highly enjoyable film with a couple of lovely ballad and brilliant images that pleasing to both the eye and the mind.

""O brother..."" is so funny, so unique, all in story, characters, conversations, images and allusions - it is that much fun one can impossibly walk out of the cinema without knowing that he spent a wonderful evening.The Characters of the three fugitives are that intelligently formed in their unintellectual behaviour, the Coens prove to be the masters of cult quotes once again.Just go and enjoy the odysee...","O Brother, Where Art Thou"

The performances were great -- especially George Clooney. It was witty, clever and a lot of fun, not the least of which was trying to figure out which scenes in the movie corresponded to events in the Odyssey.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
403,SntBacchus,An acquired taste,9,3 May 2001,"I found this film to be a brilliant combination of musical, comedy, historical drama, and southern gothic style, but it's not for everyone. To really enjoy it, you kind of need to like all of those things; but more importantly, you need to be willing to let the story wash over you like molasses and accept the cartoony characters as part of the style. (To warm up, try watching something like ""Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil."") I wonder if the people who complained about the lack of realism got the point at all - the entire movie is so stylized it's hard to take anything literally. I thought the ""We're in a tight spot!"" scene was a dream sequence for at least half the scene! Maybe that dreamlike feel, more than any plot elements, is what the Cohens took from the ""Odyssey."" (Speaking of which, if I recall my English classes correctly, that classic piece of literature's plot consisted entirely of Odysseus going from place to place and encountering odd creatures. So why isn't anybody berating Homer?)Bottom line, I have no idea what the Cohens were going for, but it sure worked for me. Just be forewarned that it might not work for you.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
404,Parthurfilm,The Brothers' best,10,15 February 2001,"Most film makers use the same techniques, the same structures, the same cookie cutter to tell a story. The Coen Brothers have a unique voice, which is no better heard than in O Brother. It's light, but it's worth seeing more than once; it deals with big issues, but it's full of big laughs. And Clooney is a revelation. Post-modernists will tell me that I'm missing a deep irony when I say just how enjoyable this movie is at human level, but take it at face value: if you need a lift in your day and warmth in your heart (and two hours of literary allusions thrown in for good measure), go see this film.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"

I'm not a big bluegrass fan, but I went out and bought the soundtrack CD - something I rarely do.This is the kind of movie you want to go out and tell people about. Why is this playing in so few theaters!? It's been several days, and some of the scenes keep playing in my head. I really cannot wait to see it again, and will be buying the DVD. THIS is what movie making is all about!For those wanting to take kids, my advice is to go for it... The worst language in the movie that I remember is ""sum bitch!"" - and if your kids haven't heard that, well, you must be a puritan. Our girls, ages 13 and 11, loved this movie. We all left the theater smiling. Go see it!","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
407,Rambimbo,"A picaresque ramble through the deep south during the Depression, with the Coen brothers as the tour guide.",8,28 December 2000,"Three prisoners from a chain gang make an escape.  It seems that one of them has four days to retrieve his stash from a bank robbery before a government damn project floods it over.  This movie is set in the middle of the Depression in the deep South, where it is apparently pretty easy to escape from a chain gang.  The three prisoners are wonderfully portrayed by George Clooney, John Torturro, and Tim Blake Nelson.  Each of them present us with likeable goofball characters who are recognizably American yet aren't cliches.   (Anyone who remembers Larry, his brother Darryl, and his other brother Darryl will nod with recognition at these three.)On their travels to retrieve the treasure, they meet up with many colorful characters, and work their way out of several tight spots.  Some of the people they meet are ordinary people trying to get by during one of America's most hardest times.  Others they meet with are legendary, mythical, or even apocryphal.  (The makers of the movie acknowledge Homer's Odyssey as their main source of inspiration.)  They even meet up with a rascally scalawag or two.As with any Coen brothers movie, the characters in this movie are unique and indelible.  The movie's plot twists and turns its way into and out of one seemingly insurmountable scrape after another.  It's a marvel to watch how these characters writhe their way out of each situation.I saw this right after re-watching ""The Big Lebowski"", and it does suffer a little by comparison.  Some of the situations in ""O Brother"" are a little anachronistic, and the dialogue seems slightly less sharp.  On the other hand, the photography is beautiful, invoking nostalgic images of a simpler, more rural time.  This movie is a pleasure to watch, especially in this particular year of a seemingly endless string of bad movies, and I recommend it highly.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"

411,pourleschiens,"fun, but slight",7,24 October 2007,"Like all the Coen movies it's well-made and beautiful to look at and to listen to. It also has the common Coen problems- it isn't really ABOUT anything, and is kind of shaggy, and seems, once you step back and look at it, to have been primarily a stylistic exercise. But there's beauty and wit here, just the same. The music is well worth remembering. Still, there are nagging feelings- while everything in the movie WORKS, I get the feeling I didn't experience as much beauty here as the brothers intended me to. I only recall feeling chills (for sheer beauty) one time, this in a film with many shots and songs included for beauty alone. This review sounds much more negative than it should, I rather liked the movie. I liked the Babyface Nelson stuff, the joke on local politics, the sirens, the toad, John Goodman beating people with a tree branch- there's plenty to like! But everything is at a distance, or else seems air-light and inconsequential,- for instance even allowing that it's a comedy and, being a Coen Bros film, is a play on style and stereotypes, does the viewer care if Clooney gets his wife and children back? I didn't. Nor do we mind much when it seems Pete has become a toad, nor when we find out he's been put back in a chain gang- nor, more importantly, does the movie seem to care. The only time one feels anything like concern for the characters is when they're about to be hung after having been pardoned- and even then my interest and my thoughts of ""How unfair!"" only lasted a second or two. Then I remembered what movie I was watching and thought, ""Oh, it's all so damn lackadaisical."" Anyway, seven points for style.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
412,Islandeye,"Full of delight, diversity and comedy: O Brother, Where Art Thou?",9,8 July 2008,"Charming is a word I'd never thought I'd use to describe a Coen Brothers film, who previously have treated us to such violent extremities as bodies being jammed into wood chippers, and pneumatic cattle guns pulverising foreheads. O Brother Where Art Thou? Is on the surface a simplistic comedy/adventure story, but in true Coen Brothers fashion, nothing is as it seems.O Brother, Where Art Thou is set in Mississippi, 1937, as the Great Depression nears its end. George Clooney plays Ulysses McGill, a scheming, energetic criminal who flees the roadside as prisoners smash rocks. Unfortunately for him he's chained to two dim-witted co-escapees, and even after the chains are off they stick together to find the loot Ulysses buried before being prosecuted.The film is partially based on Homer's epic Greek poem, Odyssey, and many of the famous episodes from it have had a typical Coen twist of character and quirk to fit with the different time, space and the sensibilities associated with the Depression-era South. Instead of the monstrous Cyclops, there's a boisterous, deceptive one-eyed bible seller. The allusions to Odyssey are expertly weaved, avoiding indulgence and not seeming forced. Each character and situation seem to naturally belong in the world the Coens create, like The Big Lebowski and Fargo, the bizarre universe of O Brother is full of human behavioural traits and actions we can recognise, but still laugh at the ridiculousness of.There are references to other cultural tales, Tommy Johnson, a blues musician in the film claims to have perfect guitar skills after selling his soul to the devil, a reference to real life urban legend of blues musician Robert Johnson doing the same in return for a mastery of the guitar. Even the title is based upon the film-within-a-film from Preston Sturges's Sullivan's Travels, the director in the film wishes to make a Depression-era stark-realistic drama but gradually realises that a comedy would be much more beneficial. Conversely in O Brother the mood of the period is one that in theory wouldn't lend to the comedic material the Coens devise, one of the bleakest points in American social history is somehow reworked into a time of vibrancy and assorted excitement.Mythology in all its forms is both an important influence on the narrative, and a plot point in itself. Ulysses, his jail buddies and the blues musician record a version of ""Man of Constant Sorrow"" for a radio station after hearing they can make some quick bucks from just ""singing into a can"". The song travels fast through the state of Mississippi and the mysterious ""Soggy Bottom Boys"" are a hit. The mythology surrounding them brings people together in speculation and idolisation, so when they show up on stage at a dinner party the crowd goes wild. Even the politicians get in on it, as the running candidate for governor jumps on stage and dances along to help his failing campaign. The Coens both celebrate and explore the power of myths, of legends and word-of-mouth for our culture.I earlier referred to this film as charming, which is a clear understatement considering how hilarious, uplifting and exciting this film is. But charm is appropriate too, due to one of the best uses of music in recent years. The bluegrass/folk music is at the core of the films ever-changing mood, and vital to expressing each varying episodes' tone. From the opening scene of prisoners singing as they smash rocks, the unified beat provided by their labour, we know that music going to be important in the film. George Clooney excels himself as Ulysses McGill, providing excellent comedic timing while playing off his two sidekicks with quick wit and guile. Who knew George Clooney was such a funny performer? The physical comedy is done wonderfully too, as in the scene with Ulysses taking two punches in quick succession, Clooney widens his eyes and flits his head to the side twice to shrug off the punches as he circles his opponent. The rest of the cast are all impressive, providing another amusing array of Coen caricatures. Forming a delightful comedy trio with Clooney are Tim Blake Nelson and John Turturro, the group has masses of chemistry  The film could simply be the three arguing for the entire duration and it would be just as funny. Even with the quick-paced plot, the two supporting performers give the characters personality and depth.It's noteworthy that this is the first film in Hollywood to be entirely colour-corrected digitally. The film has a distinct, sepia-toned hue, reminiscent of old photographs, framing the landscapes in the period of the great depression, immersing us in that old lost time. O Brother, Where Art Thou? is a unique film in the Coen's canon, never have they made such a purely joyous film  and they may never again. But for now, O Brother is deservedly up there with their best.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
413,sarahcyn,Not really Homer,6,6 July 2004,"The Homeric parallels are very thin, very over-hyped, and don't go much further than calling the main guy Ulysses and his wife Penny. The real Penelope didn't get engaged to anyone else while Odysseus was away. She knew he would come back, and wanted him to come back. The film is more a picaresque tale in the didactic style of Voltaire.Look, say the Coen brothers, here is this aspect of the Depression, here is another; here are Baptists, here is a rough gubernatorial campaign, here an early radio station, here a bent Bible salesman, here the KKK; see how wittily we touch on each and make it quaint by stringing them along our loose little tale of convicts looking for treasure, using very old and rather wonderful songs that we didn't write, but which are well out of copyright, so we didn't have to pay for them.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
414,laincolin,Homers Odyssey.,10,12 May 2020,"This is one of my all time favorite Coen Bros. films.

A wonderfully funny movie with an incredible performance by George Clooney. GIVE IT A WATCH!","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
415,Maldoror,A beautiful delight,10,29 September 2000,"Luscious and gorgeous for eyes and mind. I've seen it twice and bought the soundtrack that I play all day, and I'm going again.The Coens have this peculiar ability to make the humans enter into a dimension where they are partly cartoon figures, apparently without the use of prosthetics, something which they have done before in the Hudsucker Proxy. This may be a barrier to identification with the characters and keeps the movie from having resonant depth, but sliding along through the visuals and story is a delight. In particular the, to me, quirky and eccentric music (making one of the most unusual soundtracks for a contemporary movie) is a delight, particularly those three little girls singing of working for the Lord slightly off key.George Clooney here clearly demonstrates that he can play someone other than George Clooney, with a vengeance; the entire musculature of his face seems to have been morphed. As an unique film it won't make everyone happy, but it is worth seeing a film without any green made in the greenest state of the USA (though oddly the green is still in the poster). Enjoy! After all,Ulysses is the bedrock of our culture!........","O Brother, Where Art Thou"

A modern day version of Homer's Odyessy but that is really irrelevant.  Interesting story and casting.  Clooney was great and I applaud him for taking on such an adverterous role - so unlike anything he has done or ever will do again.  Lots of surprise stars - why isn't Holly Hunter in more.  Do something different tonight and watch this really different and unexpected flick.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"

That was the greatest movie ever!"" but it is good and solid, and quite enjoyable, especially if you know the Odyssey.  It's fun to see how the Coen brothers based their characters on characters from Homer's epic (John Goodman as the Cyclops is awesome!).  The visual look of the film is by far the coolest thing about this movie--it just looks fantastic!","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
418,Pia-12,"Superbe Soundtrack, southern accents are hard ...",8,20 October 2000,"I have seen this movie twice and it was all for the better because I could only follow some jokes in the Southern accents after having seen it before. Despite these difficulties I loved many sequences and my favourite scene is when John Torturro is screaming in the car because he feels that there are women nearby. Of course the frog scene is really hilarious ! Yet, I realized that antagonists who one can somehow still anticipate with are preferable. (Patricia Highsmith for instance even says this about her strange murderers, i.e. Mr. Ripley)  The Coen brothers' choice seems another: To create nasty characters who are really disgusting. In my opinion this aim became too obvious, but it surely did not spoil this great masterpiece with its superbe soundtrack.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
419,officersmess,"Not everyone's cup of tea, but I loved it!",8,26 May 2001,"This film held me spellbound from the very beginning.  Excellent cinematography - brilliant use of colour and image - and an offbeat but clever score.  I'm not generally a fan of George Clooney, but concede that he was very good in this.See it on the big screen if you can - as with so many, it just won't have the impact it needs on video.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
420,das-7,Great American Myth-making,10,12 February 2001,"By far the warmest and most appealing of the Coen Brothers films, O Brother Where Art Thou is a quintessentially American film. A series of lovely vignettes are full of comic moments, yet go deeper to capture the making of Modern America. The film is beautifully photographed and lit, the hard-edge ambience of the era permeates a landscape in which innocence and cynicism fight for primacy, resulting in a draw. The music is gorgeous, the references to the Odyssey arch and humorous (Penelope with a brood of daughters, pursued by an oily pol who would replace her own flawed Ulysses, is an indelible image). And George Clooney's brave, self-mocking performance is matched at every turn by an exemplary cast. This is John Turturro's best ""everyman"" performance since Quiz Show, and there is an air of unsentimental nostalgia about the whole enterprise that is peculiarly sweet and affecting.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
421,elsycurr,LOVED IT!!!,10,2 September 2001,"This was one of the best movies that I have ever seen.  I never really liked George Clooney before I saw O Brother but he was hilarious! His acting reminded me of Clark Gable in one of his comedic roles (maybe the mustache helped too).  I was so inspired by this movie that I started reading Homer's Odyssey, rented the Odyssey movie (worth watching!), and bought the soundtrack to O Brother. I know I have watched it at least 10 times, and every time I find something different. Have you made the connection to the devil (as explained by Tommy) and the Chain Gang warden? Or how George Clooney denied that God was helping them in their journey, just like Odysseus denied that Posiedon helped him to win the Trojan Wars? I love this movie!!! Thank you Coen brothers!!!!!","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
422,wtomrice,Smart comedy!,10,10 February 2001,"What an unbelievably hilarious movie!!  Every time George Clooney opened his mouth and spoke with that unmistakable accent and diction, I cracked up! What a treat to see the respect the Coens had for Homer's classic story.This was one of the best times I have had in a comedy since ""Raising Arizona.""  Since the Coens seem to recycle actors/actresses in their movies (John Goodman, Holly Hunter), I hope that George Clooney will be in future movies by these great comic directors.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
423,RmatthewC,Great integration of music,9,17 March 2001,"I found this movie to be very enjoyable and was fascinated with the almost surreal integration of music within the movie. The movie manages to poke fun at many things in a playful, but effective way.  The ""Brothers-three"" raid on the KKK lynching and the resulting dissentegration of the grand dragon's political career is a wonderful example of such commentary.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
424,Cubcreer,Fantastic movie,9,20 December 2001,"It takes a rare movie to get better each time you see it. O Brother does that and then some. The first time I saw it, I have to admit I had never seen anything like it. Then I wanted to see it again, and now I'm up to double digits with this great movie, the Coen brothers' finest movie they've ever done, with Fargo and Hudsucker Proxy coming in a tight second and third for me.George Clooney gives the performance of his career playing Ulysses Everett McGee, a fast-talking know-it-all escaped convict who really doesn't know that much at all. Tim Blake Nelson and John Turturro are the perfect sidekicks for Clooney, particularly Nelson and his portrayal of Delmar, a loyal albeit uneducated fellow escapee. John Goodman is my favorite bit character as Big Dan, perfect. It reminds me of his part in Raising Arizona, he's just a perfect actor for this role. Coen brothers' favorites Holly Hunter and Charles Durning also provide memorable performances. 
Joel and Ethan Coen are masters of their trade. It's not like they try to win Academy Awards every time they make a film, they just try and tell a story that they want to tell, and it's entertaining. It's a loose adaptation of the Odyssey, and I mean loose for all of you Homer fanatics. It's just great.The most amazing part of this movie though is the coloring. I've watched how they got the dusty feel to the movie and I am still in awe just thinking about it. The coloring does become an important part of the movie. Great great movie.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"

426,laerke_cecilie,My reviews.,9,6 February 2020,"Who wouldve known a movie about the great depression dealing with some rly harsh subjects and is basically also a ""musical"" over Homers the Odysee would be this enjoyable to watch wow just that was great,thank you Brothers.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
427,isiscloud,This movie is BONAFIDE,10,29 March 2008,"The Coen's are excellent at regional movies and letting their characters find their own voice. This one speaks and sings volumes.From beginning to end, this is my favorite Coen brother movie with Fargo so very close behind. George Clooney is perfect as huckster with a hear Ulysses Everett McGill who leads his merry band of chain gang members through Depression-era Mississippi breaking down racial lines and galloping through the countryside meeting celebrities such as George ""Baby Face"" Nelson.After convincing his chain gang mates that he has a treasure hidden away they become targets for sirens, bible salesmen, and KKK members.Charles Durning, John Goodman, Holly Hunter (who I actually like here) as McGill's long-suffering ex-wife, and more join in.The soundtrack is just as wonderful on its own as it is in the movie.Remember: Keep on the sunny side of life.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
428,Garbo46,Oh brother is right!,3,8 July 2007,"Thought I would give a comment to balance out all those glowing reviews. When I watch a movie, I don't try to find a lot of symbolism or try to tie the scenes to great literature of the past. I just watch movies to see what I see, and enjoy it or not. This was an ""or not"" for me. There were very few scenes that were funny to me. I did not find myself caring for any of the characters. When Everett just sat like an idiot while Big Dan clubbed his companion, I lost whatever sympathy I may have had for Everett. I also cannot imagine that the participants in a KKK rally would march around like a high school band from the land of Oz. Maybe that was supposed to be humorous, I don't know. Being from Mississippi, I also did not appreciate that the state was presented as some exaggerated, grotesque caricature of how some people probably perceive the state. The scenery was also not as attractive as what I've personally seen in the state. I'm sorry, I just thought all the characters were stupid, foolish, self-centered and with no common sense. Again, maybe that was supposed to be humorous. I did enjoy some of the singing, but since I knew Clooney was lip-synching, I didn't have to be impressed with him. These are not characters I would want to know nor have around me. Oh brother is right!","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
429,zeppobu,Coen Brothers do it again,10,17 September 2000,"What a movie, I saw it at the Film By The Sea festival and fell in love with it. It starts with a black screen while hearing a song (one might instantly recognise a chaingang song) and is we get a picture it is a chaingang, singing and hitting rocks. The picture looks authentic, a bit vague, the mood is set. And that is what this movie was to me, a good mood. I LOVED the soundtrack and I wish and I hope that it will be available. I ( as America in the movie) was crazy about the song of The Soggy Bottom Boys, if anyone knows where I can find it and if there was an original by whom it was, drop me a line.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
430,MrPC,Train wreck.,1,3 February 2001,"A while back, I read that this movie had been tested and tweaked many times before its release...a bad sign. There are really just two problems with this movie: there's no plot, and it isn't funny. It's been a long time since I looked at my watch repeatedly during a movie, and I really didn't expect that that could happen in a movie made by the same guys who did Fargo, Miller's Crossing, Blood Simple, and Raising Arizona. So, if you absolutely gotta see a prison break movie, do yourself a favor: skip this and rent ""Cool Hand Luke"" instead!","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
431,behart43,Maybe I was expecting too much,6,19 June 2001,"I had heard how good this movie was so much, that I made 6 trips to the rental store over a period of two days trying to catch one of their 25 copys.  I finally did get one and real excited about watching a movie that was soooo good.  Well I watch it and was very disappointed to be honest.  It was ok but not at all great.  Maybe I was expecting too much.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
432,Muldrake-2,"O Script Editor, Where Art Thou?",4,24 January 2001,"While I have enjoyed all of the Coens' brothers previous works, I have to say that this movie is probably one of worst films I saw this year, if only because I had such respect for their previous works that I went in with high expectations. The problem as I see it is that the script was trying too hard. There are far too many scenes in the movie that do nothing to advance the story but simply exist to cause a recollection of Homer's work. Whole subplots could have been excised from the script, most notably the sirens subplot, which ended with the characters in exactly the same spot as they had been before but left the audience some 10-15 minutes older. Same goes with the Babyface subplot, or the Cyclops. At least one of these 3 should have been cut from the script and the minutes added to the other subplots. Instead, the Coens include all three and meander between these scenes like a bad sitcom. The Coens strong point, the creation of quirky characters, is also sadly lacking in this feature. What made Lebowski work is that you knew where the characters were coming from. Same goes for Fargo, Hudsucker, Raising Arizona, etc. The audience came to know and love the characters' quirks, and the Coens were able to let their quirks drive the movies. In Oh Brother, however, the audience is never really allowed to see what makes the characters work, and so the plot has to drive the movie. As I noted previously, this made the movie utterly unsuccessful because of the overloaded script. On the whole, I would give this movie only 3/10, only because of the music and because one of Babyface's lynchers yelled ""Cow Killer!"" as if this were his greatest crime.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
433,unarob,Coen brothers... need we say more,9,25 March 2001,"Since it would be unfair to rate this movie against other writer/directors works, rating it on the coen brother scale I would say this scores a definite nine.  While it might not quite measure up to Raising Arizona.. It is definitely a one of there shining stars.

I was hoping for a tighter interpretation of the Odyssey, but it was good enough. the soundtrack to this movie was amazing, and that's really what drove this movie along, the music.

I have now seen it probably five times, and must say that I like it more each time I see it.  The dialogue is so quick and so funny that you don't get it the first time through.  On re-viewing, it is hilarious.  I find myself quoting George Clooney's lines now.  ""Well isn't this place a geographical oddity, two weeks from everywhere.""  This movie is brilliant.

And I liked it! I especially liked the links to the Odyssey. I learned about the Odyssey a few years ago in High School and I recognized parts of it in the film, which I found very amusing. I was also quite surprised by George Clooneys performance in the film. It's so different from the roles I'd seen him in before! In this film, he really proves that he can handle all kinds of characters. A big hand of applause as well for John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson. The tree of them sometimes reminded me of the Daltons!","O Brother, Where Art Thou"

The ""Soggy Bottom Boys"" put the Backstreet Boys to shame! Should get ""Best Supporting Performance by a Toad"" as well. 8 -- Highly recommended.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"

If Frank Capra had had some spiked punch on one of his sets, he'd have come up with this movie.  As it is, we had to wait for Joel and Ethan to deliver it to us - worth the wait!  I hung on every word, could NOT figure out how it was going to all work out, was very happy with the end - but I didn't really WANT it to end.  I wanted more!  More bluegrass, more tight spots.  More aerated livestock.  More loved-up horny toads.  And some more George Nelson. Who else but the Coens would put together this AMAZING cast and then give them material like this?

443,Spaceballs,A Top Notch Flick,10,12 July 2002,"Alright, folks... here's your riddle of the day: Whaddaya get if you cross the Three Stooges with the Greek poet Homer?""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" that's what!Here is another superb comedy finely crafted by screenwriters /producers/ directors Joel and Ethan Coen. Starring George Clooney, Tim Blake Nelson, and John Turturro, it features a brilliantly written script, superb acting by a wonderful ensemble cast, and a musical score that's simply second to none. ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" is a simple story really... set in the Mississippi delta region during the Great Depression, it's the tale of three petty criminals who escape from the chain gang in quest of buried treasure and experience a series of misadventures along the way. Ulysses Everett McGill (Clooney) is the silver-tongued, self-appointed leader of this odd trio, a man who claims to have stolen and buried over a million dollars in cash. Delmar O'Donnell is the docile, sweet-tempered dimwit (played to perfection by Tim Blake Nelson). The third member of our little gang is an irritable, acerbic fella named Pete. Together they set off, chained to each other, in search of McGill's treasure, which is buried somewhere about to become a man-made lake. Our heroes have only four days to find the loot before it's lost forever at the bottom of the newly created reservoir.As they begin their journey, the run across an old blind seer who prophesies that they will find a fortune, but not the one they seek. with a posse of law enforcement officers and vigilantes hot on their heels, Everett, Pete and Delmar ditch their chains and prison garb and continue on their quest.
Our trio's journey is anything but quiet and uneventful. They continually run into strange people and situations... At one point, soon after stealing a car and picking up a guitar-playing hitch-hiker, they stop at a local radio station and, posing as an ""old-timey"" music group called the ""Soggy Bottom Boys,"" they cut a record that's soon all the rage throughout the region. Later they encounter a Baptist congregation at river's edge, singing a beautiful song, lulling our heroes into sweet forgetfulness for a few brief moments. They happen upon three washer-women, also at river's edge, whose siren-like song ensnares our three miscreants... George Nelson, a bank robber on the run, who nearly co-opts our heroes into a REAL life of crime... the one-eyed, fast-talking Bible salesman Dan Teague (played by John Goodman) who offers Everett, Pete, and Delmar a hard lesson on economics and life in general in the Depression-ravaged Deep South... and other characters as well: Governor Pappy ""Pass the Biscuits"" O'Daniel, running for re-election against a reform-minded candidate named Homer Stokes... Everett's ex-wife Penny, soon to me re-married to a real drone named Vernon Waldrip... and a whole gang of fellas dressed in white sheets and hoods who take exception to our heroes' intrusion into their ceremonies.One of ""O Brother, Where Art Thou's?"" greatest strengths is its musical score. As the Coen brothers point out, nary a scene goes by without some kind of music in the background. The songs - 19 of them by my count - are all wonderful. It's a sublime mixture of old-time gospel and country music and African-American spirituals. From James Carter and the Prisoners' ""Po' Lazarus,"" through Alison Krause's sweetly simple and reverent ""Down to the River to Pray"" (with brilliant harmonies added by the First Baptist Choir of White House, Tennessee); the old-time country classics ""I Am a Man of Constant Sorrow"" and ""Hard Rock Candy Mountain,"" and ""You Are My Sunshine;"" to the old-time Gospel classics ""Keep On the Sunny Side;"" ""I'll Fly Away"" and ""I Am Weary (Let Me Rest),"" (and many other songs as well), the music adds an extra dimension to this already multi-faceted film. (By the way, all these songs can be found on the ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" soundtrack compact disc... but that's another review!)I've now watched ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" about a dozen times. Each viewing has been a genuine pleasure for me. This film is clever in its conception, extraordinary in its execution, sublime in its storytelling, and masterful in its music. In short... wonderfully entertaining in every respect. A definite ""must-see"" for movie-lovers everywhere!","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
444,professor_asphincter,perfect in every way,10,17 March 2003,"This is one of those films you just know everyone will be watching in 100 years. Clooney is masterful as the clark gable esque Ulyses and the rest of the cast act their socks off. Not really a comedy, not at all a drama, part road movie, part fable. High points include John goodman as the cyclops and the water bound finale. also the dialogue is crafted from pure gold.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
445,melaniejbaker2003,HOMER MEETS THE WALTONS,10,4 October 2003,"The eighth outing from the Coen Brothers, this film is a delight from the very first frame. The film is set during the Depression, in the Coens' version of the deep south, a south that glows with the gold tones of a sepia tinted photograph and features a supporting cast of weird and wonderful characters. Loosely based on Homer's Odyssey, it features George Clooney as Ulysses Everett McGill, a convict who escapes from a chain gang with 2 dim-witted side kicks, Pete (John Turturro) and Delmar (Tim Nelson Blake), in a bid to stop his ex-wife from remarrying.  Along the way they meet a blind oracle, a young black gee-tar player who has sold his soul to the devil, a manic-depressive bank robber, a trio of seductive sirens, an evil one-eyed Bible salesman, and also manage to influence the race for the governorship of the state of Mississippi, integrate the races in the deep south, and have a hit record as The Soggy Bottom Boys.Clooney proves to be more than capable of handling himself in the Coen comedy universe, and gets some of the funniest moments of the film as the hair-obsessed Everett (the image of Clooney in a hair-net is one that is not going to go away).  Everett is a feckless petty crook, not nearly as smart as he thinks he is, but in the kingdom of the witless, the half-witted man is king.  Pete and Delmar are truly witless (dumber than a bag of hammers), and much of the film's comedy comes from their prat-falling and face pulling,  but just as much comes from the wonderful dialogue, which in places is so sharp it could cut itself.Pappy O'Daniel: `Thank God your mammy died givin' birth. If she'd a seen ya she'd a died of shame!'Everett: `Well ain't this place a geographical oddity, two weeks from everywhere!'Tommy: `I had to be at that there crossroads last midnight, to sell my soul to the devil.' Everett: `Well ain't it a small world, spiritually speakin'?  Pete and Delmar just been baptised and saved. I guess I'm the only one that remains unaffiliated.' Delmar: `Oh son. And for that you traded your ever-lasting soul?' Tommy: `Well I wasn't usin' it.'Throw in the wonderful gospel and blue-grass soundtrack, the tendency of many of the major characters to burst into song, the slightly over-the-top (in a good way) acting, and the dreamy, slightly out of reality quality of the southern setting, and the film starts to have the feel of an old-fashioned feel-good musical.  This culminates in a rally of the Klu Klux Klan, which is choreographed like an MGM musical, with marching blocks of knights of the KKK performing an elaborate dance and forming the shape of the cross.  Like the dance dream sequence at the bowling alley in The Big Lebowski, this is totally unexpected, but completely at one with the universe they have created.  The plot of the movie is rambling and episodic, much like the work on which it is based, with characters drifting in and out of the narrative, and no big emotional pay-off at the end - but that doesn't matter. What matters is the journey, and it's a journey well worth taking. Where else would you get to see a cow on the roof of a cotton shack, or a police van that shoots itself up from the inside out. Unmissable.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
446,gamer2284,"O Brother,Where Art Thou Review",10,16 April 2012,"O Brother Where Art Thou is a retelling of the Odyssey by homer directed by Joel Coen.The film main actors are George Clooney,john Turturro and Tim Blake nelson. My favorite scene of the film was when Everett,Pete and Delmar sang the man of constant sorrow for the radio station. The acting in the film was great by everyone involved in the film, George Clooney was the highlight in the film and he was very convincing in his role as Everret Mcgill. The story was very interesting and had a few twists that were not expected.Te movie is one of my favorite movies ever made and it was really entertaining throughout the 107 minute runtime.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
447,agray,Just go see it,8,19 January 2001,"One commenter said that he could tell the people who enjoyed this movie don't get out much.  That's pretty arrogant.  The Shattuck theater in Berkeley was full of people who must not get out much then.True to Coen form, the movie exemplifies what I like about indie films. It's quirky.  It doesn't conform to an ""approved"" plot formula.  It's experimental.  I can pay $8.00 for a movie like that, absolutely HATE the film, and still feel that the chance was worth taking.  Turns out I thoroughly enjoyed O Brother, so that's like getting a bonus.But the next friggin' Mel Gibson historical whitewash, or the next tom hanks 2-hour cliche or the next billy crystal meg ryan syrupy romantic comedy had better be on-the-money or I'll feel I got ripped off.So if you want to go see what everyone else is seeing so you can like what everyone else liked and jabber about the same stupid characters reshot ad nauseam, then you probably want to stay away from anything like this movie. Go rent Sleepless in Seattle for the 100th time and stay in bed.  God forbid you should risk seeing a bad movie.But if you like seeing something different from time to time, then get to the theater, pony up your eight bucks and watch the movie.   You'll probably enjoy it & if you don't you can still feel thankful for the opportunity. Just don't let some arrogant film snob or some overrated TV fat guy tell you you're not supposed to like it.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
448,BrianN,Great Soundtrack,5,26 September 2001,"The Coen brothers deliver a spectacular soundtrack accompanied by a film which is truly beautiful to look at but nearly impossible to watch.  It's a series of very much unrelated episodes--some scenes which would stand on their own as short experimental films, but taken as a whole produce no more than a hodgepodge of self-conscious exercises in cinematic technique.  The soundtrack deserves its monumental success, but the film was fortunate to do lukewarm business at the box office.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
449,bert-58,A wonderful movie,9,9 January 2001,"This is the best film that I have seen in a year.  It is a loose (very loose) retelling of the Odyssey, set in depression-era Mississippi.  The art direction and photography are excellent, creating a very convincing backdrop to the tale.   The script moves along briskly, without being rushed;  every scene serves a purpose.   The music, primarily old-time folk and gospel songs performed by contemporary artists, is completely delightful.   My wife purchased the soundtrack CD the next day.   The acting is loopy and great, as is often the case in Coen films.   Here is the proof that ""traditional"" films do not have to look for the lowest common denominator to entertain.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"

451,doctorklopek-1,"O Brother, Where Art Thou?",4,11 February 2001,"This is the worst film that the Coen Bros have ever made. I was looking forward to this film for quite a while but was severely disappointed. I generally like the Coen's very much, but this has missed the mark. While it still contains some of their signature eccentricity I feel that this was created to please the masses. It seemed to cater to a different audience. The cinematography certainly had its moments (the Klan scene), and I laughed once or twice, but overall I could not wait for it to end. To be kind, the characters were drab; more often they were just obnoxious, unfunny and sometimes completely unbelievable. Most of the time I get annoyed when people say a movie ""had no plot;"" however, that is true of this film. It meandered through the old south (a good idea, I admit - it could have been great) and pretty much got nowhere. Quite uninteresting altogether... On a scale of 1-5 (1 being poor) I would probably give this a 2 and hope to not hear much about it again in the future.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
452,toddaway,Clooney's Best Role Ever,10,13 February 2001,"This movie was very funny and enjoyable from the beginning. The side-kick characters were lovably unintelligent, while George Clooney's character spoke with an ironic eloquence; a charming trait for a back-woods hillbilly. The adventure pulls you along through the whole movie without letting up, and the music will make you want to buy the soundtrack. There is a charisma to Clooney's character that can only be compared to Russell Crowe's Maximus in Gladiator. I gave it a 10.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
453,dshaw-2,What a great movie!,10,4 January 2001,"I loved this movie. Great music. Great acting.I am a fan of George Clooney but was really surprised at how great he was in this movie. I've often been disappointed by his movies before but really loved this one. Great sound track too. I laughed my head off.Contrary to a lot of other postings, I thought the weakest performance was that of John Goodman who had trouble with the accent and just was not very believable as the bad guy. Maybe that's because I'm not used to seeing him in that role, but I really didn't like his performance.
The visuals in this movie are just gorgeous and the sound track perfect.I highly recommend this movie!","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
454,richjedi,Complete and wonderful,8,8 August 2001,"Going in to another Coen Brothers film, I was expecting a surreal masterpiece of novel characterisation and black humour.  I was not disappointed.I knew a little about the film, but not a lot, and was surprised by the opening screen explaining that it was `based upon The Odyssey' by Homer'. `Based loosely upon' may have been more accurate.  Or even `Makes references to', for I will freely admit that my enjoyment of and involvement in the film blinded me to the numerous parallels between the film and the original Greek legend.  The way the Coen Brothers cleverly, even casually, weave the references in to the film is a testament to their talent and creativity. Whilst I wouldn't want to spoil someone's first time viewing the film, it's certainly an enjoyable intellectual exercise to see how many references you can find.An essentially simple plot is imbued with life by fascinating characters and the diverting episodes they find themselves in.  The pace is unhurried without being slow, non-stop without being frantic.  Clooney's loquacious rogue is perfectly offset by the incessantly dim Delmar and the occasionally volatile Pete.  Although a truism to say that the writers obviously designed this trio, the three actors mesh brilliantly and create an impressive on-screen triumvirate that one can easily believe in.  Their appearance as Country and Western singers has left me irritating my colleagues with a poor rendition of `Constant Sorrow', and I may just have to buy the soundtrack to show them what it should sound like!A muted colour palette that is reminiscent of nostalgic American photography, and glaring historical inaccuracies that I can't help find endearing serve to polish a complete and brilliant film.If you have enjoyed any other Coen brothers, then you will feel absolutely at home watching this one.  If you haven't enjoyed any other Coen brothers, then this is a perfect place to start.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"

Wacky characters, brilliant photography, and strange plots are all present in their latest movie.  This is definitely not the movie to convert people who haven't liked their previous films, but fans will love it. The biggest surprise for me was George Clooney.  Those who know him only as the ""ER"" guy and from a few movie rolls will be amazed at the man's comedic talents.  His partners John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson are hilarious as well, and the movie has great performances from Charles Durning, John Goodman and Holly Hunter. No commentary on this movie would be complete without mentioning the music.  It is one of the best soundtracks I've ever heard, truly memorable.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"

""You get it or you don't
One of the finest pieces of story telling ever to hit celluloid. The performances are so perfect and dead-on, and the nuances so subtle, that this movie defies description. It is no wonder that the reviews you read run the gamut from ""piece of junk"", to ""superb"" to just plain confused. This is a must-see movie, and from there you're on your own, you have to decide for yourself. Note, however, that this film follows its own course -- *loosely* based on Ulysses, and with its own symbolism, characters, and themes. To spot them all you will need to watch carefully, think constantly, and, in all likelihood, see the film many times more than once.

460,almdemo,A waste of space,1,18 October 2012,"Truly awful Film,one of the worst I have ever seen,the humour of a seven year old delinquent with a story written by a two year old.Thankfully I will never have to watch this utter garbage ever again.As a Coen Brothers fan this Film sticks out like a sore thumb and the amount of praise it gets leaves me scratching my head at mankind.The music like the film is annoying and the story is riddled with holes in it.Anybody who likes this film i put a black mark against its that bad.Avoid like the plague.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
461,Jack-91,Coens have outdone themselves,9,5 March 2001,I didn't expect it to happen when I went to see this movie but the Coen brothers have really outdone themselves... My favourite Coens feature until now was Raizing Arizona but I think this one has replaced it. You always waited anxiously to see what would happen next and usually it took you by surprise. A fact that is sadly not common when you go to the movies nowadays. George Clooney was excellent as John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson. This was a Coens masterpiece and they are truly legendary filmmakers. And that song really catches on....,"O Brother, Where Art Thou"
462,stephp,A hilarious scene,10,24 January 2001,"I loved this movie. I thought it was one of y2k's best. It works on many levels which I look forward to studying when it comes out on DVD. I've read several reviews, and no one mentions the movie jokes. My favorite was the KKK scene. Compare it to the scene in The Wizard of Oz where Scarecrow, Tin Man, and Lion try to get into the castle of the Wicked Witch. I couldn't stop laughing.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
463,Mexx99,What a disappointment,1,22 November 2002,"I'm a fan of the Coens since Barton Fink and for me Fargo is one of the best movies ever but I don't get this movie. It sucks. It sucks hard. I haven't laughed once and I hated all this singing. It made the movie slow, too long and boring. There isn't more to say. Just don't rent it !","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
464,jea5393,Vastly Overrated,1,13 December 2000,"This film does not do the Brothers Coen justice. The humor is strained, the writing often predictable, and it almost seems like the actors are just going through their paces. The fact that it is constantly being ""fixed"" (tinkering with it, compressing it, etc.) before American release just goes to show that the distributors realize this, too. The best thing about this film is the music. Suggestion: wait for it to come out on DVD or video.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
465,itsiph,"Bizzare, unique, confusing but still funny and entertaining!",8,4 May 2001,"Another masterpiece from the Coen brothers!  The Big Lebowski and O' Brother are very similar in that they take a seemingly ""boring"" story and turn it into a very entertaining and funny movie!  The movie has its low points, sure almost every movie does but this movie delivers good laughs through its witty dialog and the irony.  The performances are excellent, the music is wonderful and the cinematography is stunning!  I think that this is a must watch movie but if you did not like the Big Lebowski you should not bother with it!","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
466,broberts-2,Complete and total bomb,2,18 December 2000,"This is not only one of the worst movies of the year, it's one of the worst movies ever made. It's like watching a train go off the track and being forced to sit there for 90 minutes and watch it crash.  At the crowded screening I attended the movie was watched in stony silence, every joke crashing to the ground and dying.  I love many of the Coen Brothers movies and to see one that goes so terribly wrong is a painful experience. Within 5 minutes George Clooney tried to deliver a  line of dialogue and the movie died.  If I had known the premise -- Everyone in the movie is a half-wit, except George Clooney, who dispenses pearls of wisdom, I would have known better than to even attend a film with so ridiculous a plot.  In other words, if the film had broken at any point and they sent us home, I don't think anyone would have complained.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
467,RayHandley,This movie has it all,10,3 June 2002,"This movie has it all. All but the gratuitous sex, violence, and foul language that seen to be the predominant theme of contemporary adult films. I have known people like the three convicts central to this story.. this makes the story somewhat plausible. The music is wonderful, the story is funny, casting was superb and the photography in (almost) sepia draws the viewer into the era. I loved the movie, watched it twice, and will watch it again.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
468,commodorjim,"Without Question, Fun Entertainment",9,5 March 2001,"Roger Ebert may have found that the Coen Bros. were mixing there periods, but this in no way get in the way of the fun.

469,roughale,Strike Three!,10,2 November 2000,"I chose the summary, because I think O Brother is the third masterpiece in a row by the Coen brothers, after Fargo and Big Lebowski.Though each film is different, they all include great acting, beautiful pictures and very interesting characters.The humour in places is hard to take, but I just could not stop laughing. Especially the KKK scene springs to mind, I thought that I should not laugh at that, but then memories of the Olympic Games opening came to mind and I nearly rolled on the floor...The acting throughout is amazing and it was great to see Clooney in a different role, not tilting his head ;-) Torturro was amazing too, it was hard to recognize him at first, then I knew and then it was gone again as he was living the role. Maybe the third (unknown to me so far therefor I lack the name) was maybe the best, since I don't know him, I hope he was acting ;-)Bottom line is that O Brother is an amazing film and the music fits in wonderfully. I saw in the end title that the yodeling was done by someone else, but was the singing by the actors? Yup, ah thank there ain't no way not gettin' that soun'track disc fellers...Peace, song and fun, Roughale","O Brother, Where Art Thou"

471,wpsantanose,O happy days!,10,27 February 2001,"I saw this film again today with a different friend just to make sure i wasn't over doing the praise spilling out of me everytime i talked about it. I wasn't. It's the best Coen film yet: in a long line of best Coen films yet. I'll try not to ramble on about everything you've already read about: the amazing camera of Roger Deakins, the phenomenal music sets up-then delivers atleast 5 perfect set pieces, the terrific acting by John Turturro, John Goodman, Holly Hunter, Tim Blake Nelson, Charles Durning, and yes, even Mr. Hollywood Blockbuster, George Clooney, all their praises are written about much more eloquently in these pages than i could, but i have to mention Stephen Root as the blind radio station owner who is outrageously funny in about seven minutes of screen time.(if only they gave Oscars for a cameo!).                       The only 10 of 2000. Give it a shot.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
472,matthewsjcha,O Muse tell this story for years on end...,8,15 February 2020,"With some of the finest dialogue ever written, to go along with such articulately performed mannerisms, O Brother Where Art Thou shows the Coen brothers at their most light-hearted in this retelling of Homer's Odyssey.Clooney, Turturro, and Tim Blake Nelson interplay brilliantly together, each bringing a particular dynamism to their own respective characters.The collective harmony between expert screenwriting and attention to detail by the acting creates a story of an epic journey, filled with humorous interactions, ever-accompanied by investing conversation.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
473,navka,Perfect it means!,10,15 November 2002,"To be perfect or not to be perfect, that's the question! Today in cinema and its industry you have a little chance to find a movie in such a perfect harmony. Its direction, performances, editing, scenes, costumes ... are great but above all transferring contents of a novel by Homer into such scenario is really brilliant. All these elements make this movie perfect and breath taking.

They're on a mission to collect 1,2 million dollars that he robbed. What his companions do not know, is that Clooney has a hidden agenda.On their way to the treasure they meet various people who show the threesome what the values of life are. In a quite unconventional way, mind you!

476,joetaylor13,Excellent Movie,10,10 April 2005,"I saw this when it was released at the theaters. It was excellent on the big screen. When it came out on video tape, I bought it. But I had noticed some of the footage had been left out. I am wondering why. At one point in the movie, Everette tells his wife, that he is one of the Soggy Bottom Boys, and she does't believe him. I remember that she said, ""You are not one of the Soggy Bottom Boys"", and don't go telling our girls that you were"" or something to that effect. Because this was cut out, I wanted the DVD version, and my son bought it for me. Well, it was cut out of the DVD version also. Does anyone know why? Anyway, near the end of the movie, as the Soggy Bottom Boys are on stage singing, Everette's wife, drops her jaw open in disbelief, as if she were thinking, ""He was telling me the truth!"" So, what happened to the part where he told her that he in the group? Thanks","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
477,trampoline,American cinematic masterpiece,10,29 January 2006,"This film hits every mark needed to qualify as a true classic. I'm not a slapstick comedy fan and i don't enjoy the juvenile situation comedies, so this film was indeed a curiosity to me when it was first released since it was based on ""The Odyssey"". But I had no earthly idea that its purely American themes of prison convicts on the lamb, stumbling/singing ones way to instant fame, seeking an imaginary fortune and political opportunism would meld into a story that is both charming and, thanks to Homer, intricate. The Coen Brothers were extremely fortunate to have cast George Clooney as the quick-talking philosopher Everet and Tim Blake Nelson as the simple-minded but revolutionary Delmer. John Turturro's Pete is Oscar worthy, enough said. The much glorified soundtrack is pure inspiration and deserves much credit for making this film so remarkable. The Three Stooges never had so many wonderful discussions nor displayed the innocence that the Soggy Bottom Boys put into their efforts. ""Being steeped in old timey"" is one of this film's best qualities for the cinematography is remarkably characteristic of the Depression laden South and the Coens use Dixie's traditions and its institutions to their full advantage. This is a don't miss film and one of the all-time best comedies.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
478,mcavnah,Timeless classic,10,21 November 2018,"Over the years, I keep coming back to this movie and I thoroughly enjoy watching it every time. The soundtrack is amazing and fun, especially if you're a lover of bluegrass, and the cast is hilarious in this touching and comedic take of Homer's Odyssey. It's an entertaining family movie that's great for any occasion. Fun to watch and sing along to! One of my all time favorite Coen Brother's movies.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"

483,drstrang-3,Compelling,10,13 September 2002,"After the first two minutes of getting used to Clooney's dialogue and delivery - the film takes off and never stops.  Homer surely had something else in mind - but apart from an excellent film, one finally realizes - it's all about the music.  Watch it - over and over and over.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
484,Lens-2,What movie-making is all about,10,4 April 2001,"Where would we be without the Coen brothers? Well, Prozac sales would be up for sure! Oh Brother... is a wonderful tale that offers up a hilarious antidote to the classic Steinbeck view of 30s America.
The dialogue manages to deliver wit through bathos and sharp visual humour through slapstick - no mean feat that. The movie is not just buoyed along by the amazing soundtrack, it is propelled by it.I saw this film on a long-haul plane trip and then watched it all over again on the way back - it was even better the second time. If you don't get this movie, you probably don't get much at all.I give Homer 9, Ethan and Joel 10.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"

486,FlyFish,Best rental so far this year.,10,17 August 2001,Sit back and enjoy. It helps to have read the Odyssey or at least have seen the movie before you watch this. Having done so I picked up on all the subtile and not so subtile references. I rented OBWAT not knowing anything about it. Don't over analyze this one. Seeing Clooney dance and sing on stage alone is worth the price of the rental. I literally fell in the floor laughing. I highly recommend this to anyone needing a break from reality.,"O Brother, Where Art Thou"
487,steelman-5,Comic book quality-- in a bad way,5,14 July 2001,"Given the very high ranking on IMDB, I was expecting something close to the quality of two other fabulous prison/prisoner movies, The Green Mile and The Shawshank Redemption. Sadly, this movie is middling at best. Among other problems this movie has no depth, George Clooney is out of his acting element, it drags, it is stiff, and it is rather piecemeal. The trappings of a quality, good and funny movie are here, but this one is hollow. I am shocked that this is listed as the #161 best movie of all time on IMDB. I gave it a 5/10... maybe overly generous because I quite enjoyed Fargo and Raising Arizona from the Coens.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
488,zebra83,"surprising, refreshing and hilarious",10,19 February 2001,"Thank goodness for the Coen Brothers. Their success has brought them bigger budgets,but hasn't rid them of their creativity. I had planned on seeing another movie, but it was sold out so I went to this one instead. By the time it began, I had forgotten what movie I was there to see. I was surprised in more ways than one. This movie is hilarious, but they don't make any cheap jokes just to get the laughs. The writing is brilliant, and delivered with great skill by George Clooney (after this, nobody can say he's just a pretty face) and the rest of the cast. It can be appreciated on many levels, whether you remember the Odyssey or not. I can't remember the last time I saw a movie that was this clever. I've seen others I would describe as beautiful, intriguing, funny and charming, all of which also describe ""Oh Brother,"" but this movie reminded me of older seinfeld episodes where all the subplots came together in the end. You can feel that their journey is building up to something, but you can't tell what. And the Coen brothers do not fail us, the end is certainly not disappointing. It's surprising, and ties up all the loose ends neatly, without wearing the story out.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
489,Triniii,More like the 3 Stooges than the Odyssey,2,10 June 2001,"I was looking forward to seeing this well reviewed movie.  Was I ever disappointed. Pros:  The actors did a great job with the material they had.  The ending was a lot of fun.  The music was fantastic. Cons:  The computer generated backdrops I found extremely irritating.  Ulysses matched his famous predecessor in bravado but not in brains or bravery.  I like characters that develop, that learn something, even in a comedy.  I've seen this kind of slapstick a thousand times; it did nothing original, even though it feebly alluded to literature.  Poor Homer. I give it a 2 out of 10, but only because of the marvellous Soggy-Bottom Boys.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
490,mrewster,Can't wipe the smile off my face,9,23 June 2001,"I first have to say that the Coens have been behind some of my favorite movies of all time. Fargo, Lebowski, Raising Arizona all are in my personal top 100. This film wanders down a somewhat different path than the aforementioned. It is truly a uniquely timeless work. There are not very many films that I can sit down and watch with my wife, my kids, and my parents, all of us with differing tastes, and have everyone agree afterward that they loved it. From the time Clooney gets pulled from the train, to the final argument over the ring, and even through the credits, I could not quit grinning. Although there are not many ""laugh out loud"" moments(the fight with Goodman is one-""What's goin' on, Big Dan?""), the overall feel of the film seems to lift my spirit. I also must commend the cinematographer-beautiful work-the bit involving the 'Sirens' is absolutely mesmerizing. All in all, a very satisfyin' experience, mixaphorically speakin'. 8/10","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
491,mis-5,A masterpiece,10,4 January 2001,"Being a true cineatic since my early childhood I have discovered that most films generally either move you AND end up tragically or make you laugh though not move you very much. Therefore I have sort of begun to ""collect"" comedies that really have depth and ability to reach my innermost feelings... yes, I collect these movies as somewhat rare treasures, and believe me: THIS MOVIE IS REALLY ONE OF THOSE TREASURES!!! Maybe even the crown-jewel of my shrine.Just taste the essential idea of it: A travesty of Homer's Ulysses located in the hot south of the United States, that takes place at the beginning of the 20th century - surely this must stimulate your curiosity, mustn't it? Three prisoners escape their captivity, together (they have to, as they happen to be linked together by their balls and chains) aiming to find the golden loot from a robbery . They bump in to the most wonderful version of the Greek Antique predicter of future, Tereisias, that I've ever come across: A blind, black man travelling on a rail dressin.After thousands of ups and downs, coping with prosperity as well as adversity, the trio reaches a well-earned success - how this is done I won't reveal here, but I will certainly buy the soundtrack! One can't but surrender. After have watched the movie on early night show I seriously contemplated to stay and watch the late night show as well. This film is an irresistible adventure from start to end. Favourite quote? Hmmm... o yes, that'll have to be: ""Of course it's Pete - look at him!"". Definetely.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"

A great movie, a must see!!!!","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
493,sprusik,Good Coen Brothes comedy,10,3 January 2001,"I think that many viewers (including Rodger Ebert) are not seeing this film in the intended context. This is a comedy, a silly one too. Yes, it is based on the Oddysey. But it is not a dramatic epic that will blow you away with meaning. It's creative and brilliantly filmed. The characters are creative in every way. From the way they talk to how they dress. The movie is spiked with perfect music to add color. In my opinion this is a good film, and a good Coen Brothers film.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
494,ericksob,The Coen masters create another wonderful world,10,23 December 2001,The Coen brothers are visual masters ... and possess a keen wit to boot.The unique feature of this movie is the way the music (from the famous soundtrack) is incorporated with the story. It's never wallpaper. It's never background. It's always in the forefront - actually being performed. Yet it's not a cheesy musical. It's honest and exciting and makes the film come alive.,"O Brother, Where Art Thou"
495,PLundblad,Travelling to Sullivans country,9,21 February 2001,"This was the best film I saw in the year 2000. The Cohen brothers have never let me down before, and they certainly didn't this time either.It's one of those rare movies these days - it's witty, intelligent and vastly entertaining. I left the cinema with a warmth in my heart. Of course, there's lot of Cohen stuff in there - odd characters and peculiar gadgets, well-developed plot and magic camerawork. But no Cohen film is resembling any other Cohen film, if you overlook the general quality of them, of course.The big surprise for me was that Clooney is so good. But the true master performance in this movie comes from Tim Blake-Nelson. But the rest of the cast is superb too.A film that is lightweight comedy with a musical touch that evolve it's story round rednecks and old time country music - dripping with wit and intelligence. Thats a very unlikely combination. But it's exactly what this picture is.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"

This movie is not for everybody, but if you have a respect for film-making you should see this movie.  George Clooney did an outstanding job as Ulyses while his clumsy side kicks made you laugh constantly.  The Coen brothers did a brilliant job recreating this book into a visual masterpiece.  I recommend while you watch it you think of all the creativity it took to use the characters from an ancient novel and put them in a film set in Mississippi.  Funny from start to finish O Brother Where Art Thou? is a must see for all minds willing to respect this movie.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"

I had seen it years ago but hadn't remembered much, including how good it is. Joel McCrea plays a Hollywood director of comedies who wants to make a ""serious"" movie. It would based on a book entitled ""O Brother Where Art Thou?""  Well, many years later, the Coen brothers have made a movie with that title, but true to the spirit of ""Sullivan's Travels,"" it turns out to be a comedy, not a preachy social tract.

502,pinturicchio_juve,Beautiful comedy with a near-perfect soundtrack!,9,11 May 2013,"O Brother Where Art Thou was one film which had been intriguing me ever since I'd heard about it and its storyline immediately caught my fancy. A comedy- road movie about three escaped convicts who go in search of a missing treasure in the rural heartlands of 1937 Mississippi and how they end up becoming one of the state's most loved folk bands. I am told that it is inspired from Homer's epic ballad, ""The Odyssey"" and the film recognizes this inspiration in its opening credits. But since I've never read the Odyssey, I cannot comment as to whether the film stays true to it or not. But I can tell you that it is a beautiful comedy, a genre which the Coen brothers have dabbled in lately with movies such as ""The Ladykillers"" and ""Burn after Reading"". Unfortunately, their comedies are the only films I could relate to. I never really understood Barton Fink or The Big Lebowski, maybe they have many complex political and social undertones which are not perceptible to a first time viewer.In O Brother.. George Clooney stars as Ulysses Everett McGill, a prisoner in a chain gang, who convinces his fellow inmates Pete Hogwallop (Turturro) and Delmar (Nelson) to come with him in search of a treasure buried somewhere in the heart of Mississippi. This starts off a long road journey where they meet a black guitarist, who claims he has sold his soul to the devil and they embark on a series of comic adventures, which include performing a single at a radio station calling themselves ""The Soggy Bottom Boys"", getting themselves swindled by an insurance salesman, disrupting a meeting of the Ku Klux Klan of which the Governor-Elect is a member, among other incidents. The film takes an extremely light hearted outlook on the depressing lives these people led and how they pulled on without any form of economic security whatsoever. George Clooney's performance as the charming, all-knowing Everett, with a crazy obsession for neatly parted hair is wonderful, and to me invited comparisons to his character in ""Leatherheads"", which is also set around the same time. Everett is the kind of character Clooney could play in his sleep, and I sense that he enjoyed the role immensely. John Turturro as the ever-angry Pete Hogwallop is also a treat to watch, and Tim Blake Nelson as Delmar the Dunce is pleasing. But I guess the real star of the film is its music. A wonderful soundtrack, consisting of several American folk songs of the time aptly complements the storytelling style of the film. Most notable among these are ""The Man of Constant Sorrow"" which is sung by the main characters in the film, and Harry McClintock's ""The Big Rock Candy Mountains"" which appears at the beginning of the film, and has now become one of my personal favourites. The tune and lyrics fit into the mood of the movie brilliantly and are part of the reason why its such an enjoyable watch. There is an almost constant background score throughout the film, and this gives you an impression of a magical land where everything was perfect and everyone was happy, far from what was actually happening at the time. But somehow the situations don't seem all that unrealistic and you end up loving the characters all the more. You just want to keep singing that song again and again.

503,apaullocreed,"No Coen, No way how!",3,28 October 2014,"If there was any way possible to do so I would be more than willing to place a worth while wager that if this movie was released without the Coen name behind it, it would flop!With the exact same cast, effects, budget & script, the majority that flourish it with praise would of looked away and rightfully so.I am a big fan of the Coen Bros Movies & have many (Fargo, Labowski etc) on DVDS but I think that this is one project movie where they went too far with previously unexplored ambitions due to egos dominating creativity. My only description of it would be a combination of an old fashioned western movie and a history lesson lacking any tale as powerful or intriguing as found in the usual Coen script probably highly influenced by Westerns seen as children.As usual one or two twists as present in all movies of this type but none that separate it from a 60 minute more summarised show on the general screen surrounding it's release date and today.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
504,paulndani,very near to a perfect movie!,9,27 March 2006,"what can i say about this movie? from the guys who made The Big Lebowski, Blood Simple and The Man who wasn't there, not to mention Fargo! Plus Raising Arizona! I could go on but please look the Coen brothers up for yourself. This film is very near perfect. The story is maybe not the most original in the world but the way the Coens tell it is! i don't want to give anything away for the people that haven't seen it. needless to say the direction, cinematography, acting and soundtrack are all absolutely first rate. Please if you get the chance see this movie you will absolutely not regret it at all! also look out for the cabin at the end it looks almost the same as the Evil Dead cabin! I wonder why? he he he Paul. p.s. stop reading go check out the Coen brothers you won't regret it!","O Brother, Where Art Thou"

Or perhaps I just need a new DVD collection. Never fear,cry the Cohen brothers, as they more than renew my love of Film and affirm to me it still is a very powerful tool.Films should capture something, should make you think, make you laugh , make you cry. They should be so seamlessly made you forget there might be a set somewhere, The careful Alchemy of The Cohen's proves they still know this.Thoroughly enjoyable film,genuinely funny, and truly American. To take the idea of Homers ye old Grecian tale wrap it up in old time music and cinematography so great-hmm- I have spun out all the reasons why one should watch this movie to anyone whose ever asked.So let me give the highest commendation I can. It's a damn good film.It is a masterpiece of Storytelling and Technical proficiency. It is the only film out of maybe 4 5 others I felt necessary to buy after it's Cinema run was over.-and ladies the score is orgasmic so forget the rabbit and watch this instead-","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
506,kpbutler,"Bizarre, yet highly entertaining",10,5 June 2005,"Whether you like the Coen brothers or not, there can be no debating that they make extremely interesting movies that aren't by the book. There's no question that ""O Brother"" doesn't deviate from that formula. The film has many scenes that don't make a whole lot of sense to me, but I suppose if you've read the Odyssey (I have) and actually remember it (I don't) then you might comprehend it completely. The cast is solid, especially Clooney and Turturro. However, don't listen to Clooney when he tries to tell you he did his own singing, because he didn't. And it's obvious, because if that was him singing, he'd have had a few albums released. The film's strongest asset is its soundtrack, and I challenge anyone who views it to just try and not have ""I Am A Man Of Constant Sorrow"" stuck in your head for days afterwards. All in all, ""O Brother"" is a lot of fun. Enjoy.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
507,hxb,Another Coen brothers triumph,10,21 February 2001,"Very delightful, fun to watch and great to tap your toes to.  I found the movie very satisfying with regard to acting with believable and unforgettable characters delivering great dialogue, a Coen brothers hallmark.  The photography is superb with a sepia tint adding to the ambiance of the past.  The music, and I am not what you consider a Country Music fan, is wonderful and beautifully blended with the action.  The plot is as deep as you wish to delve into it with true references to Homer.  I was immediately struck with similar references to the Wizard of Oz as was a previous reviewer here.  The KKK rally truly is done in the style of the segment called the March of the Winkies from the Wizard.  Also there are strong parallels between the Governor Pappy O'Daniel and the Wizard himself.I am an inveterate Coen Brothers fan, no doubt about it.  This just the latest of their superior movies.  Common to all later Coen Brothers movies are quirky and memorable characters, great dialogue and bizarre plots.  The Coen brothers make movies with a Dickensian flair.Highly recommended 10/10","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
508,hbj200,"Clooney is awesome, but story sucks",3,16 February 2001,"This film is neither fun nor funny to watch.

A big disappointment from the Coen Brothers.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"

510,milt-9,Rollicking Good Yarn,10,28 December 2000,"I am sitting here shaking my head... Blood Simple, Miller's Crossing, Barton Fink, Fargo, Big Lebowski and now this.  So much imagination being possessed by only two should be outlawed.Unwatchable?  I'll show you unwatchable - Gladiator (dud), Charlies Angels (stinker),  MI:2 (how exciting - a sequel worse than Jaws 2!), Blair Witch Project (a great cure for insomnia).I'll admit to being partially biased to the Coens having seen everything that they've put out and devoured it at least 5 times over.  However I'll also admit to being apprehensive going into this movie based on the comments I had read both on this board and from critics.Well within 2 minutes of this film beginning I was taken in. In short, the Coen's have made the most imaginative story told this year, with the best performances of the year - Clooney is turning into a very interesting actor following his turns in Three Kings and Out Sight, John Turturro is excellent as always and as for Tim Blake-Nelson where did he come from?  Holly Hunter, John Goodman, Stephen Root, Charles Durning and co also provide excellent suupport.It was also great to see it in a packed cinema with everyone enjoying themselves.My only gripe?  No Steve Buscemi.  Maybe next time.Perhaps if the Coens had loftier intentions they might find themselves having the critics and public salivating over them (ie like the mindless drivel of 'Saving Private Ryan'). They should be admired for having the guts to go their own way, not just churning out another Hollywood feel good story.  As long as these lads, along with the likes of PT Anderson, Spike Jonze and David Fincher keep challenging us, there may be something that the Hollywood studios may never corrupt - the imagination.Roll the dice boys - I'm ready to play again!","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
511,sickdogg88,"A great sound, a great look, and a great story.",10,13 February 2001,"I was into the movie right away.  I've seen the other Coen movies, with the exception of Raising Arizona, and I've noticed that each of their movies has a color.  Fargo is gray/white, Lebowski is bright orange, and this movie is a pleasant yellow.The bright pleasant qualities of this movie start right away.  Soon the look is accompanied by the great, great music.  It's the old folk sound, the kind of music that was written during a time when music was enjoyed as a part of day to day life.  Enjoyed by everyone, chain-gangs, church choirs, and even prison escapees.Now, about the prison escapees.  I don't know what crime their characters could have possibly committed, as they are a very very friendly group of guys.  Clooney is fantastic, completely nailing his role.Go see this as soon as possible.  I believe that it can be enjoyed by anyone at some level.  For some reason, the theater I was in was full of old ladies and old men, and they loved it.You'll love it too, I promise.

It did have good acting performances all around, but the story was very predictable (used to be impossible for a Coen movie!!).  Also disappointing was the plot - it was supposed to be about 3 escaped convicts on a quest for buried treasure, but that couldn't have been farther from what really went on (didn't want to put any spoilers there).
I give it 3 out of 10, for the acting alone.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"

515,Chris King,Great all-around movie!,10,23 February 2001,"If you are a fan of off-the-wall movies, and are tired of the same old cookie-cutter comedies that make their way out of the movie studios, go and see ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"". The movie is based enough on Homer's Odyssey to make you grin (his name is Ulysses, for example, and he's questing for Ithaca, and there are Lotus-Eaters and Sirens, and a Cyclops), but not enough to take away from the movie itself. The Coen brothers also did a great job of portraying the 1930's South correctly, but without being judgemental about the times or trying to make a statement. The best part, to me, was the soundtrack -- a great collection of ""old timey"" music that you'll be humming for days. A great experience overall -- check it out!","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
516,mrbill-17,The music alone makes this movie worth seeing.,8,23 February 2001,"Coen brothers movies are generally hit and miss for me -- as is George Clooney.  I almost gave up on this movie, but I like it more and more each day.  The soundtrack deserves credit for keeping this movie alive for me. I can't get it out of my head.  With the music, I can also visualize the scenes corresponding to each song.  There are some incredible individual scenes in the movie.  The subtle humor gets funnier and funnier the more I think about it.  See the movie, but don't judge it right away.  Give it a couple of days and see if you can't vividly remember almost every scene of the movie -- or are at least itching to buy the soundtrack.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
517,jakswan,Enjoyable Yarn,4,4 March 2001,I was looking forward to this given its rating but was left wandering how its scored so high.Clooney just doesn't work for me.

518,kulpinsky_75,one of the worst movies,1,25 October 2000,"After watching ""Big Lebowsky"" and ""Fargo"" new Koen brother's film could have been expected to be at least a funny one. But please, don't expect too much. This is one of the worst movies of last years. Cast is wasted, time is wasted, and the impression like you are forced to laugh, but you can't. I had only one wish - to leave the cinema still before the end of this delirium. Maybe somebody could answer why should I laugh when John Goodman is beating John Turturro and George Clooney with log, or long-lasting scene with wedding dancing? The scene with shooting-guns in the cab is copied from the previous brother's film. Or probably it's a new film philosophy - to adopt literature classics to the hopeless would-be funny gags?","O Brother, Where Art Thou"

I had expected something decent but I hadn't expected to walk out thinking ""I can't wait to be able to buy that film"". It has an excellent storyline, all acting is top notch and it is very funny. The only complaint I would have is to say that I had some trouble understanding the Southern-American accents which the characters had (I'm just dumb) but this did not spoil the film.  The film also gives you a good sense of fulfilment and leaves you satisfied when leaving the cinema.  Go and see it.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
520,pctune,Brief critique from non-critic,5,30 December 2000,"When I entered the cinema, I was slightly nervous.  This is because:1. It was my turn to pick the film,2. I had not read Homer's Odyssey, and3. I was accompanied by relatives who were more accustomed to the usual Hollywood-style film like ""The Klumps"" and ""Charlies Angels"".I picked ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" on the strength of George Clooney and the Coen Brothers.  Sadly, my apprehension had good cause.This is a film brimming with high points.  The music, characterisations, acting and the humour all add to this solid piece of work.Unfortunately, there is one downfall to this film.  Pacing.  Time after time I felt myself squirming in my seat waiting for something to happen.The film is set in the farm-laden south an area where not much happens in a day.  That doesn't mean that we have to be subjected to repeated ""Standing on the side of the road as the world goes by"" scenes.This is an entertaining film.  It would have been more enjoyable though if it was done in half the time.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
521,nycseand,The Coen brothers depression era Odyssey.,10,5 January 2001,"Loosely based on Homer's Odyssey, the Coen brothers' latest film follows the journey of three escaped convicts through the depression era deep south. The hair obsessed leader(George Clooney) and his two companions(John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson) journey takes them through 'a great many startlements' including sirens, bank robbers, the clan and the devil.  The story flows along well through all these situations with the help of countless great characters and Coen wit.  It is probably the best movie I have seen this year and should be an automatic Oscar nominee. The Coen brothers, as always, deliver the big three: Great writing, directing and acting.  Clooney is at his best and even pulls off singing, he is bonafied! Nelson and Coen vet Turturro are brilliant as the witless sidekicks, especially Nelson. In fact the movie is filled with great acting at even the tiniest characters but the best character in the movie might be the music.  The film is soaked with American folk music from the early 1900's.  The Coen brothers use it as Robert Altman used Jazz in Kansas City. Even if it is not your cup of tea you will find yourself considering buying the soundtrack. It may not make 100 million but it is a fantastic film. If you love movies this is one not to be missed.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
522,ianclarkshill,This film is Great!!!!,10,20 September 2019,I really like this film because it's funny and has some serious parts and it's an interesting time in history.

523,Cameronm-1,One of my favorite Movies,10,31 March 2001,"This movie is one of my favorite movies (after seeing it last Tuesday). It should have won the academy award for best picture, although it didn't get any awards. I thought it was really funny. It didn't get very good reviews in my local newspapers, but the imdb reports seemed pretty good. 10 out of 10 stars is what I would give it.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
524,jesper_tved,"One of a kind, a ""must see"" movie",10,13 August 2002,"O Brother where art thou? is one of my favorite movies, it has a story like none other. From the very beginning of the movie it catches your attention and never lets go, the movie does not have any ""slow periods"" where nothing seems to happen. The movie twists and turns and introduces small stories within the story, you will never be able to guess what happens next, unless you already have seen the movie. The characters all have their own well defined personality, and seems very vivid in the hands of the talented actors, many of the characters has small lines you remember long after you have seen the movie, such as ""I'm a Dapper dan man"", ""care for some gopher?"", ""Damn, were in a tight spot"" and ""she R-U-N-O-F-T"".The movie is not a musical but it is ""song rich"". Throughout the movie songs appear, many sung by the main actors, and done so very well. Personally I think it boosts the movie making it more fun to watch. The movie is a modern version of homers ""odyssey"", and in many scenes  you will recognize things from homers book, I will not mention what, you will have to find them yourself.All I'm really trying to say is, ""watch this movie because there are none other like it and it is excellent"".","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
525,bubbagod,Dapper Dan,7,24 April 2001,"It is always difficult to see what the Coen brothers will come up with next. Always shrouded in secrecy, the public have no choice but to be surprised by their next project. In this case, O Brother Where Art Thou does not fall short.In their latest project, the Coen brothers have given the film the same kind of dreamy atmosphere that was hinted at in the wonderful The Big Lebowski. The washed out but warm colours give a very hazy feel to it all, providing a loving background to the humourous situations our 3 escaped convicts find themselves in.The performances of our 3 main characters steal the show - so much so in fact that the film tends to suffer when they are not on screen, although thankfully these moments are both short and rare.Praise must also be given for the fantastic soundtrack. I must admit I am not a big fan of country music, but the songs in the film did raise more than a smile from me.If you liked the Coen brothers' previous work, or more specifically if you loved The Big Lebowski, then you will love this. However I can see that for just as many of those who will love this film, there will be those who hate it. But I am a great admirer of the Coen brothers' work and think that this film is one of last year's most original and imaginative films.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
526,frankie_time,"If it weren't for the music, I'd skip it",5,2 September 2006,"This slightly amusing tale of 3 escaped convicts is saved by it's music. Yes, there are a few humorous moments that produced a chuckle or two, but I wouldn't sit through it again, unless it was to hear the music.Considering the acting talent in the movie, it's hard to believe it's as forgettable as it is. George Clooney does a very good job of lip synching to Dan Tyminski (Allison Krause & Union Station) although it is uncredited, so those without the thought that George Clooney doesn't sing that well (he might, remember his Aunt Rosemary) may never discover Dan's music for themselves, that would be a sad thing.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
527,bmitche1,"A little Homer's Odyssey, a little Homer Simpson",7,25 June 2001,"My wife and I commented after seeing this that we should have re-read ""The Odyssey"" beforehand to get all of the character references, but it didn't really matter that much with regard to enjoying the movie, which overall, we did.Negatives:  1)  George Clooney's character is very uneven - at times brilliant, and at times boring.  I found myself asking ""What happened to the fast-talking, quick witted guy?""  2)  The storyline took some leaps.  After the KKK scene (see below), Clooney, et al., end up at a political fundraiser (or something).  I didn't know why they were there or how they got there. 3)  Lip-synching.  Why do directors insist on closeups when actors are lip-synching?  It just makes it all the more obvious that they are not really singing.Positives:  There are quite a few, but here are the biggest ones:  1)  John Turturro is exceptional - Oscar level performance.  2)  Tim Blake Nelson is also very good.  Great comic timing.  3)  The music is great!  I tapped my foot all the way through the end of the credits.  I keep an ear out for soundtracks to buy, and this is one on my list.  4)  The KKK scene is HILARIOUS (Spoiler ahead...)  I talked myself out of believing they were ripping off the Wizard of Oz when the scene first started, but it just kept going and Going and GOING.  No ""intellectual"" humor here, just superb parody.  4)  Dialogue.  This is usually a given for Coen Bros. films, but it is particularly witty in this film, although it does get a bit over-the-edge at times (Clooney's character).Not Fargo-level, but worth a rent.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"

I honestly do not like George Clooney, but this has to be his finest performance ever.  The soundtrack is a rare gem and works well with every scene in the film.  I never purchase movie soundtracks, but this is one that I had to have. Wonderful cinematography and an enjoyable (although cerebral) parallel to Homers' ""The Odyssey"".  Even though the film was based on that poem, the work stands on its own as a wonderful romp.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"

It is also quite hilarious, and more than any of their other films, jumps off from the catapult of the enchanting ""old-timey"" music on the soundtrack.  If you don't think you'll enjoy a flick about a bunch of no-account drifters bustin' off a chain gang to find a fortune, think again.

I reckon it should be about number 9. Shame on all the people who have voted on this movie. This movie is truly impossible to categorize into one genre. It succeeds as a drama, musical, action movie, love story and comedy all in equal doses. I might add that it succeeds brilliantly at all levels. This is the movie where I finally gained respect for George Clooney,s work and have been a huge fan ever since. Actually all the performances were top notch. The soundtrack is the best movie soundtrack ever and i,ve been a fan of Bluegrass music ever since. The most under-rated movie ever!!!!","O Brother, Where Art Thou"

Second, the adaptation of Ulysse myths in a prisoner escape is a great challenge and is perfectly mastered? Actors are great and sober.

The humour is hilarious and there are many great characters, even if they only appear in one scene. I am a fan of George Clooney and he plays Ulysses Everett McGill brilliantly. The music is also a very enjoyable part of the film with its soundtrack winning 'Album of the Year'. I've recommended it to a few friends and they thought it was great as well.

540,roykommers,Feels like a walk through a fairytale-forest,10,20 June 2002,"I'm a big fan of the Coen brothers and I think this is one of there best films. Well at least it is the one that is the most fun watching. If you compare the different Coen brother films you'll see that every film has its own style and use of colours and no two films are the same. Because of this every Coen brothers' movie is a surprise and this one certainly is.The story is about three prisoners who escape and go on a quest to find the treasure one of them as hidden before he ended up in prison. From the moment they escape the most strange and amazing events start to happen. At least that is how the viewer and the three main characters experience everything. In reality nothing strange happens, but the Coen brothers succeeded in making every little thing that happens seem very mysterious. For example: three women who are washing their clothes in the river, sounds like nothing mysterious, but the Coen brother make you believe the three women are sirens. The movie is full with little things like this, which makes it some kind of eerie, thrilling, fairytale, in which everything seems and is possible.The events occurring are not solely eerie end thrilling, as told previously, but are also good for a lot of smiles. Yes, smiles not laughs it is not a comedy, but it is a feel good movie and a good one. If the film ends you will have a big smile on your face, which will not disappear for quite some time. The movie feels like a walk through a fairytale-forest and that feeling will stay with you for some days.Like in the Coen brothers' movie Fargo the most important colour was white, this movie also has one most used colour, this time it is brown and yellow. In every shot these colours are present and dominant. Also there is a lot of use of filters. Those two things together give the movie the dreamy, mysterious appearance. Because of this the movie is full of beautiful shots and even that alone makes it worthwhile to see the movie.
To conclude: if you want to see a movie which is fun to watch, gives you a happy feeling, has a good and unpredictable story, gets you thinking, has great actors and sublime directing, than this is the movie you want to see.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"

I expect a good movie - and I got a really great movie.George Clooney, John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson played great. The atmosphere of the south-state feeling is great too. Into not one of the 106 minutes playtime you got bored or disappointed. There are a lot of humor and even more music in it. Yeah - sometime you think it is a specially art of a musical or something like this. But this is not negative for this movie - I think the music elements adapt oneself to the movie.All in one I can everyone recommend to watch this masterpiece of movie-art.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
542,khabilepravin,Visually stunning peace of art,8,24 December 2007,"O Brother this one is surely entertaining, the most beautiful Coen brothers movie.The screen play is so engaging that you almost feel traveling with the characters.There are lot of good things about this movie, acting and Screen play are one of the most important. But the two most powerful things which make this movie an unforgettable experience are its music and cinematography. You might as well grab an OST of this.George Clooney and John Turturro are great as always, but strangely the performance I liked is of Tim Blake Nelson he just fit-in perfectly in the character. The locations chosen of Mississippi are visually stunning. This like every other Coen brothers movie can be enjoyed multiple times.This is surely 8 out of 10.Visually stunning peace of art...!","O Brother, Where Art Thou"

I love George Clooney's character as a dumb man who thinks he has it all together. John Turturro is excellent as usual (""you stole from my kin!""). And anyone who's seen the Disney film Holes will appreciate Tim Blake Nelson's character.Definitely some political undertones in the film, but try not to read too much into them and you'll enjoy an adventure film with some moments of comedy, drama, and many religious themes.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"

546,muskrat-5,This is a classic.,10,13 November 2006,"I've seen this film three times now and each time I find new reasons to love it. It - just - gets - better. The scenery is exactly right, the casting was A-1, the acting is great and everything fits together like a jigsaw puzzle.I can't say enough good things about this film, but since we have a minimum requirement on IMDb I'll try to say more. Oh right, I really love the music in this film. I don't care that Clooney didn't do his own singing, the lip sync was very good and the pieces chosen for inclusion reminded me of my grandfather and my father who knew how to make that kind of music (but on the fiddle).This should be a required view for all students in American schools. Sure, it ain't ""hist'ry"", but it's ""derned"" close! Ahem...","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
547,Keith H.,"They've done it, again!",10,1 January 2001,"Several months ago, I was wondering what the Coen brothers might be up to. I figured they must be working on something. Well, this is it and oh, brother it was worth the wait!The performances are terrific. I've never disliked George Clooney, but I'd never seen anything to really make me a fan until now. The details he brings to the character in O, Brother are wonderful. The cast of Coen ""repeaters"" joining him is a real treat.This effort is not as rapid-fire as Hudsucker, but the barn scene in particular put me in mind of some of the faced paced stuff from Raising Arizona. The music in O, Brother, both incidental and source, is integral to the mood of the film. I'll be looking for the soundtrack tomorrow.If you're a fan of the Coen brothers, you will not be disappointed by O, Brother. I am a fan and can recommend it very strongly.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
548,Baenbreij,well so...,5,14 January 2001,"And yes saw it in France with a french girl with French people all around and made a real discovery about the audiences but as far as the movie it was well you know like not so damn great being a coen and all and then there's the whole thing about the etc etc etc 30's and you know funny yes but for crying out loud not as wonderful as so many things the coens've done and who could disagree that the very presence of Dr. Clooney was a terrible mark on the whole experience, the black guard that he is, the base sensualist..But as far the film itself regardless of the like two-dimensional characters which yes one expects from the Brothers you don't have any of the like mind blowing nice type of symbolic writing which you found in other of their films, like...  it was the twisting and wonderful writing and diolog without the like soul some how...  yet for chrissakes, still interesting to watch. a coen brother's movie, you know...  what can one say?","O Brother, Where Art Thou"

The writing, direction, acting, and music are superb. It's not often that the audience applauds down at the local megaplex, but they did tonight.  The snappy dialogue could have been written by Preston Sturges. This one is an original.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
550,celeborn-2,Sublime genius. An abstract masterpiece of adaptation.,10,15 January 2001,"In ""O Brother,"" the Coens have really outdone themselves! This adaptation of Homer's Odessey to 1930's Mississippi is an out-right panic attack of sublime comedic genius. Students of literature would do well to consider this running commentary on the ancient epic as a poignant analysis of what makes Ulysses tick. Clooney is perfect as the self-obsessed Ulysses, who is destined for greatness in spite of himself. Goodman is a hilariously menacing twist on Polyphemus. The Sirens are down-home, backwoods eroticism distilled. The featured song is also a grabber.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
551,MrJoe,I was surprised,9,10 September 2001,"I rented this movie out of desperation, I was surprised at how good it was. Thoroughly enjoyable, offbeat, with great music.

552,Trex21,Bonafide Gem,9,15 January 2004,"O Brother is a delightful movie, quirky and filled with laughs. The laughs don't come in rushes, but in a steady stream of wordplay and bizarre situations. I thought it was so-so the first time I saw it, but after a second viewing I was hooked. I had a similar experience with the Coen Brothers' The Big Lebowski. Repeat viewing adds to the pleasure because their films tend to have many layers. The music is wonderful too(partial proof being the album sold over 3.6 million copies!).","O Brother, Where Art Thou"

A MASTERPIECE for the ages.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
554,goodwin-2,One of a kind movie stuffed with a variety of pleasures.,10,6 February 2001,"I just got back from the cinema, and felt compelled to comment on this film. It just totally blew me away for several reasons. The 30s period detail wasn't period detail--you felt you were in a time warp and were back in the Depression era. George Clooney, especially in a couple of scenes, eerily reminded you of Clark Gable. The humor was unexpected and I haven't laughed so hard in a theater in years. And the photography was beyond gorgeous--the bleached out sunlit look of many of the settings was outstanding. Interesting film that gives you a lot to think about.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
555,songofthesouth,My hat is off in respect to the makers.,10,21 June 2001,"Trustingly, I purchased both the DVD and soundtrack without ever having viewed the film. I should trust more often. It now ranks among my favourites. You truly get the feel of being in the South from frame one, complete with a chain gang, shotgun-toting supervisors, and a cold, villainous warden. Every detail in this movie is beautifully accurate (minus a few intentional and very forgivable anachronisms). Even down to the title's font, a Tuscan Ornate-esque style poster font that is true to its era. Not to mention the film's colour effects (like the sepia fades and golden overtones during the siren scene, for example) add a clarity and crispness to the experience that enhances it perfectly. Those are but a few reasons why I have such a deep respect and love for this film. I would (and do) recommend ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" to anyone I feel deserves the honor. My hat is off to all those who worked on this film.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
556,al-263,The Best Coen Brothers Film Yet,10,27 May 2000,"Just seen this film at an NFT preview, and I was blown away by it. It is very funny, gorgeous to look at, has a stunning soundtrack and absolutely impeccable comedy performances. Sharing a similar meandering storyline with the Big Lebowski, it succeed where that film fails by still having a coherent storyline running through and a satisfying resolution. As I've come to expect from the Coens, the visuals are striking but they've never been this beautiful before, and at no time - unlike - in previous films, do they seem merely to be there as an exercise in cleverness. But what makes this film is the excellent comic performances from even the smaller roles (several of whom are Coen regulars) - Even though the characters, as in many coen films, are (slightly irregular) stereotypes the performances give even the shallow characters a depth and makes the scenes even more funny. Oh, and the soundtrack ain't too bad either.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
557,toddh,Another Great Movie from the Coens,9,3 January 2001,"Forget about the Odyssey, think Preston Sturges.  The Coens like to take a genre and make a new movie in that vein (Miller's Crossing is a gangster movie, Blood Simple is film noir, Hudsucker Proxy is the wisecracking newshen comedy).Yeah, OK, the main character (who looks a lot like Clark Gable) is trying to get home in a Homeric way, facing obstacles and fighting monsters, so he can return to his wife, but that's just the broadbrush outline of the plot. The reference to Homer might even be sort of a joke.  People know that a Coen movie is a tribute to some style of film, so maybe they deliberately put ""based on Homer's Odyssey"" in the opening credits.You might be looking for Homer, but what you'll get is Sturges.  It's a 1930s or 40s kind of comedy.Two things impressed me at the start of the movie.  There's that scene with the three convicts chained together, falling out of the freight train (you've seen it in the trailers or the TV ads).  Immediately after that, they meet a blind man who predicts their future.  It's a funny scene followed by a framing scene.  The wise old man (and a blind one at that) is an old story-telling technique -- like something from Joseph Campbell's explanations of the journey of the hero (or maybe something from the Odyssey).  Here and there, other myths or folklore pop in (a guitar player at the crossroads and a gubernatorial candidate whose theme song is ""You Are My Sunshine"").The Coens are creating a myth and they're borrowing liberally from myths both ancient and modern.Here's what I want from a movie: To transport me to a different world and to surprise me.  I could go through the movie and list the parts that transported me (the baptism scene was like watching mystical, musical ghosts).  And I love the scene where the three convicts, plus the guitarist, play their song.  In a period of about five or ten minutes, several plot lines were wrapped up -- bam bam bam bam.  But I won't spoil the plot for anyone who might be reading this.Plus, there's lots of humor.  It's a very funny movie.One thing bothered me: the Ku Klux Klan part.  Yeah, I know the KKK are the bad guys, but they're just so obviously bad.  It's like putting Nazis in a cartoonish movie like Indiana Jones.  The minor character who decided to be anti-KKK was basically a jerk.  However, maybe that's part of myth-making, you insert a character (like the devil) the audience will automatically hate.Overall it's a huge thumbs up.  Not as good as Miller's Crossing or Fargo, but definitely worth seeing.The Coen brothers have made another great movie.ToddH","O Brother, Where Art Thou"

I understand there are people who do not get ""real"" world humor and for those of them who just stumble into this one...oh well.I can see this film surpassing Raising Arizona as a college cult film.

George Clooney shows a deft (often deadpan) touch for comedy, and a dozen or so other characters are woven in and out of a tale that was amusing throughout.

Any lingering fears that the South shall rise again should be laid to rest by this film and the zany characters who inhabit it. Great film!!!","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
562,acm72,dammit,9,31 May 2000,"And there I was, thinking that I could get the first review in! I was at the same NFT preview, and I was damned impressed by this film. The Coen brothers have used many actors from their usual team (Johns Goodman/Tuturro etc.) and have mixed them up with a varied bag of others to produce a very fine character driven cast. The action rarely dwindles and there are some fine set pieces to remember, many of which are punctuated by the type of visual gags that are seldom witnessed outside of a Zucker/Abrahams film. The storyline is apparently based on Homer's odyssey, but as both brothers have admitted to never having read it the plot is not constrained to any level of accuracy, and their splendid imaginations are able to run rampant. This film is a visual and comic treat, more focused that the Big Liebowski, funnier than Fargo, and as those are the only other Coen brothers films I can remember now I will end my comparisons there. Go see it.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"

A few people had told me to go see this movie and I'd laugh the whole way through.  WRONG!  I kind of chuckled once and that was seeing George Clooney dance a little jig toward the end.  I noticed that it was only the late 40's and above crowd that was laughing in the theater.  My friend and I were laughing in disbelief at the people who were laughing at this movie.  The music was the best part so I should've just bought the soundtrack instead.,"O Brother, Where Art Thou"
565,cellypelican,"Hand-clappin', Tub-thumpin' Good Time!",8,5 July 2001,"The music should co-star w/George Clooney in this wonderful movie about Depression-era escaped cons, traipsing thru rural Mississippi. The screenplay is an adaptation of Homer's The Odyssey, as cited in the opening credits. Very strong performances by Charles Durning, John Goodman, John Turturro. Holly Hunter was a big disappointment, however. She appeared, almost as an after thought.The photography was beautiful, evocative of hot, humid summers in the South. Many scenes were sepia-toned, reminiscent of Butch Cassidy/Sundance Kid of years ago. The story did drag a bit in the middle.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
566,bhogadi,I loved it...,9,19 June 2001,"Though I knew that it's gonna be a good movie, I was a little skeptic about my readiness to watch such an artsy movie after a long day. The movie is so much fun to watch, plot-wise, comedy wise and the acting.Tim Nelson as Delmar O'Donnell is wonderful, esp the toad part. And John Goodman was terrific. Not to mention Clooney and Torturo. Impressive casting. I am going to buy the soundtrack of this Movies. (Needless to say the songs are good. ""I am a man of constant sorrow"" is quite enjoyable!)","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
567,folkman,Truly Lamentable. A Waste of talent.,3,30 October 2000,"One of the worst films of the year.  The humor (or lack thereof) is lowbrow, the acting mediocre.  The script is jumbled, discontinuous, and inaccurate; the acting talent (Clooney, Goodman et. al) is wasted.Clooney takes on another one of his trademark leader-of-the-pack roles, searching for a large sum of money he stole away before being carted off to the penitentiary.  He and his two southern sidekicks nose their way into a number of odd adventures on the way.Perhaps the defining (read: worst) moment of the film is when the three attend a KKK gathering.  The scene´s topic is too serious to be funny, but too poorly done to be convincing.  The resulting scene leaves the viewer unsure of how to react - usually eliciting a hesitant chuckle, followed by a long, confused silence.I saw this movie in Spain, and the entire theatre agreed in a hearty unison when I concisely and audibly summed up the movie as the credits started to roll: ""Mierda!""","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
568,Selene-11,Sheer delight!,10,8 November 2000,"This film made me feel happy!   I realise that it was tongue-in-cheek, but I saw a serious comment on bigotry with regard to the KKK and politics. Most of all, I enjoyed the production and the excellent acting by ALL concerned . It was difficult to single out any one actor but I really enjoyed George C hamming it up for all he was worth -  A change from his usual roles. My friend and I laughed a great deal and I shall remember it for that reason - I did not have any difficulty with the Southern accent - just had to listen carefully.  Another success for the Brothers C!","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
569,bizarrono1,"Boy, was that STUPID!!!!!",2,2 January 2001,"I just saw this movie, it was GARBAGE! I got dragged to it by a friend who gave it a 10 (???!!!!!). She wanted to see ""Quills"" more, as did I (to be honest I didn't want to see this at all). Since she doesn't like to see dramas late at night I deferred to her and unfortunately ended up suffering through this. I admit I am not a big fan of the Coen brothers, but this was really bad even for them. They are more ambitious than their talent can support imo. Joel Coen should NOT be allowed to direct ANYTHING he and his brother have written the script for.The combination of really stupid 'humor' and highbrow artistry in this movie made for an annoying experience. Yeah, yeah, the performances were good or better for the most part, but they didn't come close to redeeming this pile of dung; a wittier and/or more realistic screenplay (I say this knowing that the movie wasn't trying to be realistic; be prepared for a lot of masturbatory ridiculousness if you see it) certainly would have though. I personally gave it a 2 (it was going to be 2.5 until the INCREDIBLY painful scenes at the end) because I laughed a few times, and it had a few good fairly esoteric references.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
570,cham2,Pleasantly suprised,10,4 June 2001,"Headline says it all really. I was a bit sceptical about going to see the film. Firstly the location was an 'Arty' cinema house and that sort of gave me the impression of an 'arty-farty' concept film, not made for the pleasure of the mass public, and a film to establish Clooney as more than a hearthrob. However, I read the review of the film, and according to the review the film would need to be watched more than once to be able to appreciate all the humour, as it came thick and fast. I think that comment was meant for the Dutch, originating from the UK I had no trouble with following the film.To my delight I was delighted with the film. Clooney played his part excellently as did the rest of the cast. The humour was great, at times very stereotypical, at times very subtle. Even though I had heard of the film it was not a huge box office success to my knowledge, which I think it deserved to be. Watch it and be surprised.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
571,ndyja99,luke warm,6,6 January 2001,"I really, really wanted to love this move.  But I didn't.  When I realized I had gotten to the end, it felt as though I had stepped out from the movie for a good half hour, and came back in time for the end.  Poof it was done. I adored the acting, the wit, perfectly chosen soundtrack, the stunning cinematography.  Very clever idea of creating a hillbilly Odyssey -- almost worked for me. But the momentum within this little world was forced to get to an end, and I felt that I was missing a big chunk.Yea, I love these filmmakers too.  But it was a whole lot of very clever plateau as far as story goes. Gonna have to brand it with the horrible stamp of ""RENTER"".","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
572,bad.to.da.bone,The Coen brothers have a remarkable talent for making the incredibly stupid seem incredibly funny.,9,31 December 2000,"This movie is not for everyone.  I loved it  it even makes up for ""The Big Lebowski.""  You have to have a certain love of the absurd to truly appreciate it.  About 1/3 of the screening crowd I saw it with laughed uproariously in the right places, the other 2/3's were looking like they were on the outside of an inside joke.The story is (very) loosely based upon ""The Odyssey"" by Homer.  I'd describe it as ""The Odyssey"" meets ""Time Bandits"" without the short people.  It's about three escaped prisoners  two of which are few fries short of a Happy Meal  who stumble across an interesting cast of characters while trying to recover a fortune from an armored car robbery.I thought John Goodman was great as Big Dan Teague (Cyclops).  He plays it absolutely straight with no hint of the absurdity of his proposition. George Clooney displayed admirable comic and possibly singing skills.  I still don't know if they dubbed in someone else's voice for the songs. Charles Durning again proved himself as one of Hollywood's most versatile character actors.  My only disappointment was with Holly Hunter's part. She didn't get enough material with which to work.Highly recommended for those with an off-kilter sense of humor.

574,techarea,Best Musical since ''Singin' in the Rain'',9,5 June 2001,"I am of the old school. Brought up on Laurel and Hardy, Marx Bros. and Gene Kelly movies. (Am only 23) This movie has, as have most of the Coen Bros. movies, bought my faith back into movies. With some of the rubbish being churned out by Hollywood (could go on for hours) it's nice to see something wrote, directed and acted with such flare. The story follows three 'on the run' prisoners (Clooney, best performance so far, Tuturro, never fails to be at his best, and Nelson, Best part he could have) in pursuit of a great fortune.  I know a lot of people who won't go to see Musical films because they automatically think of 40's style films.But the music in O'Brother ties in beautifully with each scene without slowing the film down or seeming out of place.  No one just breaks into song in the middle of a sentence. Once again the Brothers and their casting director have picked out the perfect cast and their isn't a bad actor(ess) in attendance. The one aspect that really stands out though, is the filming.  Soaked in light, the backdrops and scenery look worn and fit in perfectly with the mood and setting of the film. I couldn't recommend this film any more to fans of real movies and indeed fans of Hollywood Trash who need to be enlightened.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"

We both went home arguing who would read Homer first (and we will probably both be disappointed).

O Brother, Where Art Thou? is not only enjoyable on an intellectual level but an emotional level as well.  The only problem that I have with it is the decision to credit Homer in the opening credits. I would have liked to find that out on my own.  There is simply no excuse for not seeing this movie.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
584,easyriderak,Spectacular,10,28 February 2001,"The movie kicks ass.  Eveything about it is amazing from the great soundtrack to the spectacular cinematography.  The Coen Brothers have done it agian except this time it is going to be hard to top.  I highly recommend seeing this great film, i have seen is 6 times in the theater and am not done yet.  This is defintly going to be a classic if it is not already.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
585,darkston,"Beginning to end, an A class film",10,9 September 2001,"As with any movie, audiences will have varying perceptions of a film, but it seems as though the Coen brothers' films lend themselves to a greater degree of difference in opinion.  O Brother, Where Art Thou?, in a nutshell, is a very smart movie about not-so-smart people (though that comment certainly can't incapsulate the depth of the film).  That is a common thread for many of the directing team's films, and it serves to show seemingly ordinary people in extraordinary circumstances.  The most humorous points in Fargo, for myself, came in points where there was no laugh-out-loud hilarity, just subtle close-ups on the strangely normal. Raising Arizona is certainly no different for me in that facet, and while I find these subtleties to be quite obvious, I doubt the type of people they parody would find it nearly as enjoyable.  O Brother, Where Art Thou? follows this trend inexplicably well with a hint less guarded humor.  Clooney's dialogue is quotable and hilarious at all times, and this movie is wonderful.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
586,atom_project2004,"Peculiar, and strangely impressive",9,12 July 2001,"Overall, I thought this was an excellent film.  It contains very artistic filmwork mixed with a unique plot and storyline.  This movie making technique usually makes for a successful outcome with the public. The only thing I thought could have been better in the movie was George Clooney's character.  You see, he was supposedly a traveler born and raised in Mississippi, but his acting was not very convincing.  Sure, he had the southern lingo very well, but what about the accent?  His two friends in the movie, Pete and Delmar, were a couple of countrified hicks, and their acting was very convincing.  Then there was George Clooney's character.  He made it seem like he was a yankee hanging out with a couple of rednecks.  And that is not what this movie was about. However, I thoroughly enjoyed the well-assembled cast, such as John Goodman, Holly Hunter, and Charles Durning (who was my favorite character, supplying most of the comic relief in the film)  It is obvious that a lot of planning was put into the production of ""O Brother, Where Art Thou"", and I give this movie a 9 out of 10!","O Brother, Where Art Thou"

588,alternatetitle,Educated,8,18 August 2001,"I being of what i would call infantile knowledge of filmmaking have to say that this was one of the best movies i have ever seen. Having been recently introduced to the finer points of moviemaking, and no longer satisfied with your typical commercial ""show"", this movie is exactly what i have been missing in all my years of moviegoing. Not having read Homer's oddessy i cant draw all the comparisons necessary to completely judge this movie with full merit, but if the movie did nothing else it did open my eyes to a whole new world and has given me a compelling desire to read Homer's classic. This is a movie that i could watch again and again and gleen more from it each time. I watched it just recently as most people did and am excited to watch it again very soon. One thing I especially like is that it is a movie that is not necessarily understood the first time you watch it. The movie left me wanting more at first almost unsatisfied, and yet that is what makes it so wonderful.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"

And all this is coming from a true Appalachian Hillbilly- if there's one thing I know, it's a good ole time- and this movie is a good ole' time in spades!

592,Corkscrewed,The Siren Scene alone is worth my $7,9,2 October 2001,"The Siren Scene, is beautifully choreographed slooooooow seduction set to the voices of three real sirens, Emmylou Harris, Allison Krauss and Gillian Welch. Even if you didn't like the film, as many people have a love hate relationship with the Coen Brothers, you owe it to yourself to bend an ear to the soundtrack.  For those of you who have already experienced the music, check your local arthouse for Coming Down the Mountian a film about the making of the Oh Brother Soundtrack.  It debuted at South By Southwest Film Festival (I believe) in 2000 and was just brilliantly recieved.  Check it out!","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
593,antialiasis,Hilarious and clever.,10,5 April 2007,"I saw this film years ago, and afterwards I named it as my favorite film on several occasions. Then I forgot why. Now I saw it again and remember.The plot is simple enough: Everett (wonderfully portrayed by Clooney), a handsome, vain man whose lines undoubtedly contain over 70% of the film's vocabulary, gets the two prisoners chained to him, Pete and Delmar, to join him in seeking a treasure he buried after an armored car robbery before a river is dammed and the valley in which he buried it flooded with water. Meanwhile they are chased by a cold-blooded Sheriff Cooley (at one point in the film subtly likened to Satan) and have to overcome various obstacles ranging from Pete supposedly being turned into a toad to being seduced by three blatant references to the sirens of the Odyssey. This all becomes amusingly tangled into the electoral campaigns of the two men running for governor, 'Pappy' O'Daniel the hotheaded old man who is striving for re-election and Homer Stokes, who is secretly a Ku Klux Klan leader.There are few films that stand out to me as being 'perfect', ones where there is nothing I can nitpick on, but this is one of them. It is neither too long nor too short, the humour is golden, the characters are endearing, every scene would detract from the film if it weren't there, and the ending is very satisfying but not sappy. Wonderful film.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
594,xjones,A superb and extremely enjoyable film.,9,5 May 2002,"Having never seen a Coen brothers' film, before (but having never heard a single negative comment about them) this film was both refreshing and engaging. From the fabulous gospel and bluegrass soundtrack, to the witty and clever adaptation of Homer's Odyssey, to the fine acting from the entire cast this movie was superbly crafted and as a result, extremely enjoyable in every regard (the pacing in particular was very well done). I especially loved the delivery of the clever but subtle dialogue. Clooney's character and his portrayal are gems. I am happy to give it nine out of ten, now that I've reread how many superlatives I've written!","O Brother, Where Art Thou"

(and not in a good way). Of course there is such a thing as suspension of disbelief, but there is equally demanding that the audience switch off brain faculty, and hope that a left-field reputation and Gorgeous George will be enough to disguise lack of content.It was entertaining in that I didn't switch it off but it was completely soul-less and without emotion. And doesn't lead to me to want to watch another Cohen brothers film again ever.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"

The ""style"" of the movie seemed to conflict with my opinion on a good movie. However, once I actually decided finally to watch it, I realized how wrong I was. A very clever comedy, very nicely acted, and with a certain ""flavour"" to it which is rare in movies these days. Clooney's performance as the fast-talking ""know-it-all"" with his explanations for every event in the movie make me laugh every time. The ending is a little weak, ending a little too abruptly for my tastes. I'm the type of person who likes to see a movie ended a little more thoroughly. Of course, that doesn't mean going over the top (see wonder boys)Worth watching, don't miss out.9/10","O Brother, Where Art Thou"

The story is great, the actors like Clooney or Goodman play fantastic and Roger Deakins did marvelous the work of the director of photography! Wonderful landscapes, and a lot of professional pictures! The portrayal and the characters are very entertaining, the Coen brother made great! Yeah, the music was great too, the country songs typify the mood of the US in 1930s!The connection with the Odyssey shows itself in many times: 1. the Cyclops was Big Dan, who got the car of Ulysses and Delmar 2. the Sirens were the three girls by the river 3. the Lotus-eaters were the Baptists in the forest 4. when Ulysses sleeps something bad happens 5. the journey in the Underworld was like the theater scene 6. in the restaurant, where Ulysses and Delmar brought the frog in, there was a statue about HomerI can only offer this movie for everyone, it's a great entertainment! Go to the DVD library and watch it! You will have a wonderful experience!","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
600,martin-rice,Quirky but great fun!,9,28 March 2012,"This is actually one of my favorite Clooney films. Y'see there's these three soggy guys by the names of Everett (Clooney) Pete (Turturro) and Delmar (Tim Blake Nelson), who escape from a chain gang and embark on a journey acrost the state of Mississippi in the depression era 1930s. Loosely following Homer's Odyssey, they jump from one frying pan into the next fire, and over again. They get lost, get saved (a marvelous baptism scene) and manage to squeeze themselves into the strangest musical renditions and dance sequences imaginable. Clooney gives a classic performance as a character I can best describe as the humanized version of Foghorn Leghorn: a know-it-all who loves to hear himself speak. Then there's Pete played by John Turturro who's a grumpy guy along for the ride. At the bottom of this food chain gang is Delmar played by Tim Blake Nelson. Ole Delmar is a simple fellow with a good heart who's trying to keep a clean spirit in leu of the events these characters become involved in. Woven into this deep South motif are a black blues singer who sold his soul to the devil, two shady candidates for the guvna's office, and a one eyed Bible salesman played by John Goodman. There's so many things to notice in this film. There's a looney tunes quality, but also a very realistic quality, portraying the Depression era politics and poverty to a T. There's also a three stooges quality, and the at the same time a very Preston Sturgess humanist thing. It's the perfect balance for me but quite possibly the coolest thing about this film is the music, topping off that old timey look the film has. It's awesome bluegrass, delta blues, and gospel music and it's a character of it's own in the film. Long live the Coens.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
601,CaptainSkye99,"Not for everyone, but awesome none the less.",8,21 October 2005,"When I first rented this movie, I had heard about the unbelievable soundtrack, and so my family and I decided to give it a whirl. I must say, it's one of my favorites to date.The story itself is clearly derived from the Odyssey, and we see frequent references and resemblances as such (our heroes run into various ""monsters"" and the like; cyclopes, sirens, etc). While some may be turned off by the ""strange"" themes and circumstances, anyone who had read, heard of, and/or liked the Odyssey will most likely enjoy this film. All the actors do their part well, especially Clooney who (while his role may seem a tad reminiscent of his other work) does a very nice job of portraying the main protagonist.The biggest treat out of all is the movie's score. The score is absolutely wonderful, featuring all variety of original music by popular artists such as Alison Krauss and Gillian Welch.Overall, this is a good movie for those who enjoy any one of the genres it falls under. I would suggest renting it and checking out, as it is not for everyone. Despite anyone's tastes, however, it is undeniably a fine work of art that will be remembered.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
602,runnoft-1,Still my *FAVORITE* movie,10,20 May 2007,"I saw this movie in the theater when it first came out, and loved it then. When it became available to own on VHS (and then later DVD) I bought it. I've seen it probably 25 times, and each and every time I see it, I glean a bit more from it.I love everything the Coen Brothers do, this being their best, in my opinion. EVERY line, I mean EVERY line, is genius. The comedy is often subtle, or ""dark"", but some is outright. I'm not familiar with Homer's Odyssey, (which the movie is VERY loosely based on) but actually bought a copy of the book to further engross myself in this movie; to see the correlations, besides the Cyclops.Terrific acting, terrific music, humor, action, romance, comedy, drama... does it lack anything? NO is the answer. The Coen Brothers combined brain is a theatrical genius. To me, no movie made prior or since, by them or anyone, comes NEAR the caliber of the brilliance of this movie. Do NOT miss it, OR the soundtrack!Just a note: I don't pick movies apart, I look at the total package. This one is a 90 minute vacation of pure enjoyment.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"

605,wild308,"Reformation and Progress in ""O Brother Where Art Thou""",10,12 February 2011,"Like many aspects of the movie ""O Brother Where Art thou"", the title is an allusion of an allusion. The Coen Brothers themselves have been quoted as saying that the title references the fictional book of the same name in Preston Sturges' 1941 film Sullivan's Travels. In this earlier movie, John Sullivan, a movie producer, is on a search for a better movie based on the adaptation of the fictional book, ""O Brother Where Art Thou"". This title is itself an allusion to the novels of Steinbeck and ultimately even to the story of Cain and Abel in the book of genesis. In the Coens' movie, O Brother Where art thou, the characters are on a search for literal treasure. In neither of these movies do the characters find what they are looking for. The viewer too, may not find precisely what they are looking for. Indeed, if one expected to find a story as ""fine"" as Gulliver's Travels or one whose moral is as universal as the story of Caine and Abel, Sullivan's travels would fall short. As would any viewer be disappointed if they expected the movie ""O Brother, where art thou"" to be, as the character John Sullivan would, a serious movie that about the plight of the downtrodden. following the trail of these allusions places the viewer too on kind of treasure hunt, never ultimately finding what we are looking for.The most overt allusion that the movie draws from, The Odyssey, seems conversely to give the viewer the most ""treasure"". Odysseus is there in the veil of Everett Ulysses McGill as are his shipmates and family. The angry gods make appearances, as do the sirens, the Cyclops and many more. However, the quality and scope of these characters seems to have degenerated throughout the ages. Instead of Odysseus (Ulysses in Latin) the great king overcoming great woes to guide his men home and return to his loving family, we are presented with Everett, a two-bit con man who fools his men into helping him return to his estranged family. The family too seems degenerate. Odysseus' wife is utterly faithful and goes to all length to fight off her suitors. His son is a brave prince who tries everything to find his father. Everett's wife Penny, on the other hand, is ashamed of her estranged husband. She lies to her daughters and tells them that Everett has been hit by a train, and plans to marry her ""suitor"". After seeing her, Everett even calls her a ""succubus"". The Coens seem to have gone out of their way to deprive the characters of ""O Brother Where Art Thou"" of any vestige of the heroism and greatness that their forebears once possessed. A one-eyed bible salesman has replaced the great Cyclops, the sirens are now just highway robbers and ancient Greece has become 1930's Mississippi. Even the comic narrative of ""O Brother Where Art Thou"" proves inferior in quality to that of the epic Odyssey. In framing their degenerate narrative in such sharp contrast to the heroic Odyssey, the Coens do more than invite comparison. They have re-formed the Odyssey and emerged with something poignantly less. In doing so, they seem to hint at the fact that reform is not synonymous with progress.This idea is one that recurs again and again in the movie, but never as noticeably as in the side-story of Pappy"" O'Daniel. Pappy, is the governor of Mississippi. Pappy is shown to be a fat autocrat. However, his opponent, Homor Stokes, the ""reform candidate"", is shown to be much worse. He is, in fact the leader of the KKK. We even find out that the nature of Homer's political reform is to combat racial integration in Mississippi. Again, we see the idea of reform leading to a reversal of progress.One notable exception to this idea comes in the form of radio. No doubt, the radio represents a ""reformation"" of technology, and yet it also is a positive image in this movie. Everett and his men are helped in a way that Odysseus could not be by the power of mass communication. ""The Suggy Bottom Boys"" are first made famous by their songs on the radio and then later use radio to vanquish Homor Stokes. No doubt, radio is a prime example of how re-formation can be positive. ""O Brother Where Art Thou"" does not seem to present the idea of reform as strictly positive or negative. Instead, we are offered a different image: that of manic depression. This notion is made manifest in the movie by the character of Baby Face Nelson.In the last scene of the movie, we are presented with an image of a flood washing away a valley. Everett explains that the entire state will be put on hydroelectricity, which will bring in an ""age of reason"" and put an end to ""backward"" ways. Indeed, the viewer knows that Everett's prophecy has come true. Since the 1940's America has been re-formed by electricity. However, given the ambivalence with which the movie treats the idea of reform, perhaps Everett's optimism is premature. It is ultimately left to the viewer to decide whether the vast reform of America brought about by technology is, like radio, a cultural progression, or else like the narrative of the movie itself, a step-backwards.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
606,chewy2k2,This is real Coen brothers,10,25 June 2005,"To me, this is what the Coen brothers means. Not Fargo, which is a bit more subtle, but this wonderful parody of one of the most highly regarded historic writings. to take a legendary story and put it in a John Turturro format is not seen nearly enough. Clooney does comedy well, especially when eating corn whilst Delmar is beating repeatedly. Script, Setting, Story, Parody, Blasphemy, Ku Klux Klan, this is Coen brothers. even better than ""Bar,ton Fink!, Bar,ton Fink!"" And then there is the song. Man of Constant Sorrow, made me get the entire soundtrack, now it's not even my favourite song! all those chanted songs are surprisingly awesome. Coen's picked well. And the first thing you say to someone after they have been arrested and you meet up in a cinema so must whisper should always be ""We thought you was a toad."" Wonderful, surreal, funny, pretends to be full of messages when its just Coen's taking the mick!","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
607,nutriafritz,Most memorable movie experience!,9,12 February 2005,"Like the rhapsodes who stitched together tales to form the Odyssey, the Coen brothers have brought together Homer, blues and bluegrass, George Clooney, and digital photography to create a modern-day epic-comedy. The first 12 minutes feature the memorable opening scene (which I understand uses the soundtrack from a real chain gang), the highly amusing song ""Big Rock Candy Mountain"" and the train scene which makes me laugh out loud every time I see it. In fact, this is all I saw the first time in the theater, due to a power outage. My husband and I received a voucher and couldn't wait to see the entire movie the next day -- based on only the first twelve minutes! I saw the movie in Louisiana, and ""You are my sunshine"" was written by our former Governor Jimmy Davis. I got a lump in my throat when the entire audience began singing ""You are my Sunshine."" O Brother is based on Homer's Odyssey, and it's a fun parlor game to see how many episodes from the Odyssey you can recognize (John Goodman playing the Cyclops is the most obvious). The one thing missing: they need a voodoo priestess to play the role of Circe to try and change the frog back into Pete! One word of warning (not a spoiler): There are two instances of animal brutality that are hard to watch (but it's obvious what's going to happen).The DVD is a must-have... it shows how they took the verdant Mississippi countryside and digitally enhanced it to make it look like the dustbowl of the 1930s.Film buffs will recognize tributes to Cool Hand Luke and the Wizard of Oz, among others. The Coen Brothers are geniuses.Now you'll excuse me... I've got to R-U-N-N-O-F-T.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"

We hung those boys but I guess this is a good Hollyweird take on that situation. Love George Clooney. He reminded us of a Gable or a Flynn type. Both had relations with our girls. We disowned all! Here is my niece Ethel and her story.We lived through the depression and related to some of the conditions portrayed. We have watched it perhaps a dozen times. Each time we see it we pick up on something we had missed because we were still laughing at, or discussing, an earlier scene or line. The entire film was a collection of photographically great faces. We are still asking ourselves whether the entire cast were professionals or whether some were individuals found on location. The film was rich with subtle tie-ins like the children tied together with twine, as the prisoners were connected by chains. We still think the cow may have been hit unintentionally. Fords of that era had mechanical brakes. The driver of the car may not have been accustomed the longer stopping distances required. The many allusions to Ulysses Odyssey inspired us to do an inter-net search. We found a modern text version and discovered more sly references. We appreciate blue grass and country music as originally American and found it thoroughly enjoyable, along with the authentic ""Go To Sleep Little Baby"" and ""Down from the Mountain."" We were emotionally touched by this film because of our age, and find it totally entertaining every time we view it. We are still amazed that someone not of our generation could have captured the essence of that period of United States history.My niece is mentally unstable and you should not take her seriously. These characters really existed and some still live. They are still interested in larceny, etc. so you should beware! We remember the Baptismals in the river ceremonies. Get Baptized!!!

I thought this was George Clooney's best movie he's ever acted in, with Michael Clayton a close second. The trio of guys fit perfectly and the rest of the cast was tailor-made for this type of movie. The score was fantastic as well by T. Boone Pickens. The digital color correction, which is also used in the recent TV series ""True Detectve"" is something I'm a big fan of. You really felt like you were in the deep south experiencing that era of life. I wish these kinds of movies came out more often. It's sad that these types of movies aren't typically guaranteed to make a lot of money. In today's age the world of cgi combined with action commercially is selling like wildfire, while our overall desire for well-scripted and acted movies is diminishing.

What a good surprise to find an intelligent comedy, with critics about religion, politics and every cliché from south America. We're following those three men as they travel across the land, where people elect the candidate setting up the best show and where religion is depicted either as a forgiving act of baptism or as a good and easy way to get money, both playing with credulity. The KKK and its link to both politics and religion is also well depicted, while the seductive money make families betray themselves, strangers sell each other, or Baby-faced man plan robberies.

What matters is the documentation and depiction of the Deep South as shown in this movie. Oh how it ""rattles one's cage,"" i.e., the KKK, yet beautifully depicts history and tradition that was locked in, and intractable to a certain way of life.The music is haunting, and cleansing at the same time. The song, 'Down to the River to Pray,' one feels the Baptism to one's very soul.

My wn] son, my brothers and I all loved Raising Arizona.  We laughed till our sides ached, and it was without doubt the most hysterically funny movie we had all seen... until O Brother Where Art Thou? was made.  Now we have TWO fabulous comedies from which to choose whenever we are down in the dumps and need a GUARANTEED LAUGH! A BIG PLUS in this movie was the excellent music.  The sound track alone lifts the spirits -- even with the Soggy Bottom Boys' big hit having such a ""downer"" title:  Man of Constant Sorrow.

And I mean not only because it is an American-made film, but it is about a part of the complex, many-faceted country we call the United States.  Oftentimes, the South is given short-shrift in films.  It is usually the scapegoat of America's sins in popular culture.  But, like any human thing, to see the South only as backwards, bigoted and uncouth is to miss the point that all places and peoples are at times and in places, bigoted, backwards and uncouth.  It shows us that not everyone in the South was or is racist or ignorant.  This film reminds us that in the midst of human lowliness, one can find beautiful things: the humor, the music, and the irony.  It also reminds us that, as one colleague of mine put it, that the two groups of people who have most in common are the poor whites and the poor blacks, and when they get together, beautiful things can happen.  This films is a ready-made American classic and only gets better with every viewing.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
617,dcallman,"Great Music, Very Good Comedy",9,12 January 2001,"I have been a fan of the Coen Brothers for Many years.  What surprised me about this movie was how they successfully incorporated bluegrass music into the movie(which I have previously not been explosed to) I am now a fan of this type of music.  I hate musicals, but without being a musical itself, it is very close to being one though and it added greatly to my enjoyment of the movie.  The movie is very funny in a 1930's version of Dumb and Dumber Kind of movie, but with the high quality integration of very entertaining musical moments it becomes a great Movie(at least for me).  The Sirens were the high point for me, the often repeated A Man of Constant Values was well done and the song Rock Candy Mountains was wonderful in its authentic sound.One of my favorites of the last several years.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
618,matinicu,A solid film that delivers.,9,4 October 2001,"I've already watched this film twice, and plan on seeing it again. It's a solid piece of work that delivers great entertainment. Acting, plot, cinematography are all flawless. It was easy to sit back and enjoy this one.If you enjoy Hollywood blockbusters, you might find O' Brother difficult to watch. The Coen bros. have a keen sense of pace that keeps the plot moving without lingering on details. Transitions between scenes can be fast, often times omitting information that you can otherwise assume. Very similar to Raising Arizona in this respect.The soundtrack is also worth noting. Traditional folk songs arranged by country veterans and newcomers. You've probably heard most of the songs, but never with such life breathed into them. They are beautiful, joyful, sad, and eerie. These recordings are only available on the soundtrack, so it's worth the purchase... even if you've never seen the film.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
619,JSL-3,One long stupid string of stereotypes.,1,5 February 2001,I could not wait for the movie to end. Should have been titled The Three Stooges in Mississippi.

What a disjointed collection of garbage.  It was almost bad enough to warrant turning it off, but how can you comment on something you didn't finish.  I think I laughed about a half dozen times.  My two co-viewers laughed even less, one even commenting something to the effect of ""What a waste of 2 hours.""  Thankfully it wasn't quite that long, it just seemed like it.Clooney was okay, but with that terrible accent he sounded like he was talking with a mouthful of Mississippi mud.  Was it just me or did that accent disappear and reappear several times?I also had a hard time keeping up with the plot holes.  Where did this car go?  Where did that car go?  What was the deal with the blind policeman? How could a river flood and fill up the valley so fast?  Did they just keep going in circles to end up in the same places and near the same people?Just plain bad!","O Brother, Where Art Thou"

This movie definitely deserves a strong 9 out of 10.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
622,boydnest99,Best movie I've seen in a long time,10,5 May 2001,"For those who expect a movie to make complete sense, and want a tidily written script which braids up all the loose ends, stay away. For those of you who like movies like The Holy Grail and Transylvania 6-5000, you might like this one.  There are anachronisms, there are certainly plot holes.  So what? This was one of the most genuinely funny movies I've ever seen.  I didn't slap my knee very many times, but I smiled from the opening scene of the three running through the soy bean fields to the look on the governor's face as he said, ""Aren't you, boys?"". The look on Delmar's face carried me through the slower times.  Living as I do in the center of Bluegrass and Southern Gospel music (I was not raised here) I loved the music. I went out after the first time I saw it and bought the soundtrack. The second time I saw it (two days later and four days ago) I saw and heard things I missed in the first.  I will buy the video when it comes out and wear it out. Just like my other cult favorite, The Holy Grail.Last bit of advice: if you have to ask why it's funny, go to another movie. It's not for you.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
623,kafka-20,boo,8,14 January 2001,"The Coen Brother's have done again what they are best at. This movie is flawless and well rendered. The dialogue is witty and interesting and the music is first rate. The problem, which was first posed to me by an article in the San Francisco Chronicle (I think), is that the movie has little to say in a broader context. There is no new philosophy to really be taken from this movie, though it is a kick-ass ride. I still think that it's the best movie of 2000, but then, that's not saying much.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"

PEOPLE, this is not a movie it is an abomination. Modern science and mathematics fail me at this point as I cannot find a way to give this tripe a score low enough to accurately reflect it's cinematic worth. I can only assume I am too far out of the main stream on this whole deal as I was not even aware that Homer's Odyssey had this particular format. Shoot, I wasn't even aware that Homer Simpson had written anything and would have thought he could do better if he did! Nevertheless, I am compelled to attempt to complete my own Odyssey and rate this movie. the following are my futile attempts:1. negative infinity out of ten2. Black hole out of five stars3. 4 thumbs up (the Coen Brothers' butts)","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
628,qblgay,"NOT a lover of Country-Western music, I was almost converted.",9,19 August 2001,"Having read and taught Homer's Odyssey at the university level, I was thoroughly entertained by the motion picture and its clever parallels to the poem.  Characterizations were excellent and lip sync superb.  Not a lover of the depression era genre movie (I was bored out of my mind when I saw THE GRAPES OF WRATH at the age of 10 or so), this entertaining adaptation of a Greek classic enchanted me from the beginning.  The ending was a little disappointing (squabbling over a ring seemed too ridiculous for a woman in love), but as one who prefers ""Classical"" music and ordinarily despises Country-Western, I was almost converted by the music in this film.  Each time I watch it I find somethning new and delightful. -JFG","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
629,jrm-9,not one of their better efforts,3,20 January 2001,"Ok - so I caught on to the loose parallels with the Odyssey. The sirens, John Goodman as the Cyclops, Holly Hunter as Penelope. Maybe I missed something, but the whole Odyssey thing seemed like forced cleverness.The movie came across as a collection of hollow stereotypes that managed to expose the Coen brothers' obvious contempt for the culture of the rural South. Because they are so out of touch with the people about whom they wrote, the lines often came out lifeless and flat. Particularly with Turtorro who was totally miscast as a hillbilly. He sounded like he picked up his Southern accent from watching episodes of Foghorn Leghorn. Also - I though hillbilly music literally came from the hills - Appalachia - not the Mississippi Delta.I would be interested to see the Coen brothers turn their vicious parody machine on a culture with which they have some familiarity - say Jewish culture. Could you imagine if a couple of Southern boys had made a film that brought to life all of the negative stereotypes associated with New York Jews -- perhaps set against the musical stylings of Gershwin's tin pan alley??The movie came across as slightly too mean-spirited.Not one of their better efforts, in my opinion.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
630,a.orzel,Oh Brother will be the Coen's biggest box office hit to date,10,1 October 2000,"Although not the Coen's best writing (aka The Big Lebowski) Oh Brother is a very funny and well produced film. The film will be the CB's biggest box office success because it does not contain the violence and language of most CB films and will thus appeal to a wider audience. Despite the lack of violence and language the film is still Coenesque in that it is well cast, beautiful to watch, and outrageously funny. Unlike their other films this film will make the CB's millions of dollars and new fans. 10/10.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"

633,teachem2,Roger Ebert needs to rethink his review,10,4 February 2001,"I was so disappointed with Roger Ebert and his little Ebert toady (Roeper?) and their review of this movie that I had to respond.  This movie was given two thumbs down on their television program. There hasn't been such a mistake made by prominent critics since William Shakespeare was called an uneducated hack by London critics in the 1500's.O Brother Where Art Thou is a film that stands so far above any competition in the comedy arena this year that I'm afraid a lot of critics can't see its brilliance.  It's a Coen Brothers movie so, of course, the writing's slick, the characters are interesting, the actors are given the chance to be as creative as they can, and the movie itself is just beautiful to watch. What makes this movie stand out is the way that it combines so many different elements of creative history to form one boiled down piece of art.  Here is a just a little taste of what is going on in this movie:  Sullivan's Travels, Homer's Odyssey, The Wizard of Oz, Bonnie and Clyde, Cool Hand Luke, Robert Penn Warren's All the King's Men, James Dickey's Deliverance, not to mention a real modern-day commentary on spirituality.  That's not all that's happening here, either.  I could write a book about it.  There WILL be books written about it.There's a KKK scene in the film where the hooded imbeciles dance around in a semi-choreographed ritual before attempting to lynch a black man.  This scene bothers people because it makes fun of something we as a society deem so serious.  I agree, the KKK (especially at its height of popularity) was a serious problem.  However, in this film, the KKK can't sing on key, can't dance without stumbling over each other, have a one-eyed member with only one-eye poked out of his hood, have a dwarf in a KKK suit, and don't have ANY control over the situation at hand. Get it? Not only are the KKK in this movie clearly villains they are also extreme idiots.Okay, I think that's enough, even though I could go on and on.
There are some truly mesmerizing scenes in this film.  The writing here is as fancy as the visuals in Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon.  There aren't many flying swordfights or digitally enhanced scenes in O Brother, but the words dance and zoom over the rooftops of the American South.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
634,bbybp,Brilliantly Original,10,31 December 2000,"The Coens have done it again! A brilliantly original and entertaining film that brings out three wonderfully comical performances from Clooney, Turturro & Nelson. The best being George Clooney whose facial expressions and hilarious delivery of the unique and classic Coen Brothers dialogue was just brilliant in itself.The cast, supporting cast, direction, dialogue, and wonderful storytelling and scenery made for a totally enjoyable movie.Also, kudos to Mr.Clooney for doing a damn fine chicken dance!","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
635,charris2a,What a great movie,9,31 December 2000,"Many of the criticisms of this movie I think are trying to put ""O Brother"" into the same mold of the previous Coen brother movies and that is a mistake. This is a warm, entertaining film that actually has something to take out of the theater and think about. Basing the story on Homer's Odyssey is thought provoking and refreshing, not trite at all. I agree that George Clooney's performance was surprising and quite good. The music is wonderful and a nice change from the Jan Hammer music styles we hear all too often. Overall, I think this is a great movie experience and one that has something for everybody.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
636,chucho_wig,A Serious Comedy with wonderful characters,10,28 February 2001,"The Coen Brothers have truly outdone themselves in this wonderful saga of three escaped convicts. Though it is based on ""The Odyssey,"" the ancient work of Homer, you do not have to have read ""The Odyssey"" to be able to follow the story. The brothers Coen have woven a tapestry of celluloid and aural delights! The soundtrack is intrinsic to the film, indeed it is as though the soundtrack is the product and the film is wrapping paper. Each character is wonderfully exploited and harkens back to the days of old when films were rich with character actors whose very appearance in the film adds richness, texture and authenticity. George Clooney is magnificent as the grease haired Everett Ulysses McGill, a honest con on the run whose pompous linguistics and vocabulary are comical and endearing. O Brother, Where Art Thou is easily the best Coen film to date as well as Clooney's best effort. Clooney is good enough to warrant a best actor nomination as is Tim Blake Nelson's portrayal of the dimwitted friend Delmar, while the film itself is deserving of a Best film nod.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
637,goheen,Good Movie - a story to be seen.,9,8 January 2001,"Fargo was okay, Raising Arizona was okay, This movie is a keeper.  I've heard of Homer's Odessy, but I've never read it, and Homer gets credit for helping with the script.  If the Odessy is anything like the movie, then I'll have to go find it and read it.  This is the best I've seen from George Clooney.  The 2 hour tale is only slow in a place or two and the music is intertwined.  It helps to have an appreciation for some of the old Gospel songs and some bluegrass.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
638,tva-2,"O Brothers, There you are!!!",10,10 January 2001,"Have to say that I was completely impressed by this outing by the Coens.I left ""The Big Lubowski"" somewhat disappointed in the wake of ""Fargo"", but in retrospect, it's still a good movie.  It just wasn't ""Fargo"".""OBWAT?"" is ""Fargo"".  Though differently.  There are thematic similarities between Lubowski and O Brother, but the joy this movie conjures is genuine.I haven't felt this good about a movie since, well, ""Fargo"".There have been some comments saying this movie is only for Coen Bros. fans. I completely disagree.  This film is completely accessible from many angles.  Not least of which is the fact that George Clooney is quite good in this.  No.  Really good.  But Tim Blake Nelson deserves ""Best Supporting"" for this.I'm not even into Deep South Gospel and I'm thinking of buying the soundtrack.Completely excellent.  Wouldn't change a thing.  It's going into the home catalog as soon as it's committed to media.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"

Go listen to the samples at amazon:  If you find this stuff hopelessly cornpone, then save yourself the aggravation and see a brain-dead action thriller instead.  But if you appreciate American music from the pre-TV era, you really shouldn't miss O Brother.Oh yeah -- While you're at amazon, buy the sound track.

Too many funny lines and situations to remember - I'll have go see it again, and get the sound track. In addition to the comedy the movie itself is just beautiful - check out the color of the the trees in the baptism scene.

641,tonyw-7,A cinematic gem!,10,13 January 2001,"I loved this movie. Basically I got to see 2 for the price of one. Not only is it a hilarious, zany, comedy but also a long overdue, heartwarming tribute to American roots music. The soundtrack is incredible and I hope it goes platinum. Congratulations and thanks to T-Bone Burnett. Being a great fan of the famous blues legend, Robert Johnson, I was tickled to see him get some screen time in this movie as ""Tommy Johnson"", sidekick to the Soggy Bottom Boys who, with the fake beards could quite easily pass for another fine blues band from the South - ZZ Top !!. If you love authentic American roots music of any kind you will appreciate this movie. As far as the acting goes, it is all round superb. George Clooney's performance has converted me from a sceptic to a believer.Though the Odyssey is ostensibly the inspiration for the movie, I think the Coen Brothers are trying to put us off the scent of what must be the real inspiration - Jim Jarmusch's classic 1986 ""Down by Law"" featuring Tom Waits, Roberto Begnini (before his Life was Beautiful), and John Lurie. Down by Law is also about the rambling adventures of 3 misfit escaped convicts, only they are on the loose in the bayous of Louisiana, not Mississippi, and even has the same roasted gopher scene in it. Rent at your local video store if you can find it.Quite simply the movie experience of the year for me.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
642,comadog,I joined IMDB just so I can comment on this movie!,10,14 January 2001,This movie will be remembered as on of the great movies of the year.

643,ash-173,A Faulknerian Odessey,10,16 January 2001,"O Brother is, simply put, a spectacular tour-de-farce that has all the elements required for a great movie in the style of old Depression era Hollywood. Before seeing this for the second time, we rented Sullivan's Travels by Preston Sturges. It was really cool to see the references the Coens did to Sullivan's Travels in O Brother!Now, a few comments about O Brother: The visuals were stunning. From the antique cars to the grimy clothes to the brilliant yellow fields, this movie gets an A+ for visual depth and brilliance.  Likewise, the soundtrack is great. I'm personally a fan of hillbilly music, but even my husband and friends who aren't could get into the great music. Also, the dialogue was hilarious! There are some great, ludicrous gems in this movie. Also, the characters were truly brilliant, Faulknerian in their tragic comedy. After seeing this movie, I wish the Coens would do a film adaptation of As I Lay Dying, IMO one of the greatest epic comic/tragedies Faulkner ever wrote!The characters brought this movie to life. Ulysses Everett McGill, the fast-talking, inventive ""Paterfamilias"", played by George Clooney was both likeable and ridiculous with his schemes.  John Tutturo's flashing eyes and fierce expression, coupled with his gravelly voice and molasses-thick dialect, stamped the role of Pete on my heart. And Tim Blake Nelson played the innocent, empty-headed, big hearted Delmar with charm reminiscent of Evell Snopes in Raising Arizona.  It was no wonder butterflies flocked to the childlike, charming Delmar- if an ex-con may be called charming.The secondary characters were also terrific. McGill's estranged wife, Penny played by Holly Hunter, the seven little Wharvey gals, the acerbic Pappy O'Daniels played to the hilt  by Charles Durning, the malefic Big Dan Teague, Bible salesman-cum-mugger, hilariously played by John Goodman, George (""NOT Baby-Face"") Nelson, Tommy Johnson and the Devil, just to name a few.By the way, does anybody else think that the prison warden was the Devil? Think about how Tommy Johnson described the Devil at the crossroads, then look at the warden...All in all, to those to complain that this movie is ""pointless"" or just a ""bunch of stuff strung together"", I humbly suggest that that is what an odessey IS. It is a journey in which the journey itself is more important than the outcome. O Brother is an epic farce which brings together a rich stew of elements of Depression era history, politics and nostalgia, mixes it with some truly outlandish humor and mythic storytelling, and brings it all together to create one of the most heart warming, feelgood movies I have ever seen.I give this movie a 10/10.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
644,Isabel762,A truly wonderful movie.,9,4 April 2007,"I first heard about ""Oh brother, where art thou?"" from a friend about a year ago. She fondly remembered the movie and declared it as one of her favourites - after that i was itching to see it. I finally got to watch it a couple of night ago and i was far from disappointed.""Oh brother, where art thou?"" is a beautiful movie starring three escaped convicts hunting for treasure. It is a story of friendship and adventure. I watched it with my family, ages ranging from 8 - 40 + it kept us all engaged which is very difficult in a family where we all have different tastes. With a beautiful soundtrack, picturesque locations and above all brilliant acting this film really is a must see.9 out of 10.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
645,bigwig6273,Masterful...,10,20 January 2001,"Not being a fan of the Coen Brothers or George Clooney, anyone can see the skepticism I took into the theater. Once again, someone in Hollywood dares to create something different. This time it was those zanie (for a temporary lack of a better word) Coens doing ""their thing"" to one of the great works in literary history. Who would've ever thought Homer had this in mind? I don't know where this film is going to fit in the history books of Hollywood, but it will be in both mine and many others DVD or VHS library. It is one of those films that you can watch over and over. The story is brilliantly written. Clean and entertaining, with a couple of Gumpesque brushes with fame, great performances by Clooney, Turturro, Nelson, and a brief but hilarious Holly Hunter. Being born in Mississippi and raised in other parts of the south, I wish more people would poke a little fun at us like this. They even invoke a soundtrack fitting for the rural south. You are NOT doing anything better this weekend, go see this movie!","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
646,stewart.mcfall,A truly unique movie,9,11 February 2001,"I had high expectations of this film going into it, and once again, the Coen brothers have not disappointed. ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" is the type of movie that may not click with most people on the first try, but definately deserves a second or even third chance to fully understand and accept the characters. One of the biggest complaints that I've read about this movie is that it doesn't really go anywhere.  That's exactly the reason why I liked it so much.  The film doesn't concern itself with spectacular special effects (with the exception of the cow scene), intriguing plot twists, or a grand finale.  Instead, what the Coen boys are best known for is their characters. George Clooney is excellent as a fast-talking wannabe know-it-all while Tim Blake-Nelson and John Turturro are equally as good as his dim-witted sidekicks.  Clooney is quickly moving up the list of my favorite actors. I really respected the way he was able to poke fun at himself and his leading man persona by creating a character who is so worried about his appearance that he wears hair nets while he sleeps.  I left the theater (both times) thoroughly satisfied perhaps because I realized before hand what I was getting myself into.  The lush scenery of the Depression-era South and a soundtrack better than any I've heard all year only add to the rich tapestry that make up this film. I guess then, that the most important thing to remember if you do go see ""O Brother Where Art Thou?"" is that it's the journey that counts, not necessarily the destination.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
647,ebradway,Outstanding!,10,30 January 2001,I enjoyed this movie more than anything I've seen in quite some time. This is easily the Coen bros. masterpiece.

648,rmm,Loved it!,9,25 January 2001,"I've seen ""Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?"" twice already and loved every minute of it.  I took my mother to see it and she was truly amazed at how accurate the Coen brothers were at portraying Mississippi in the 30's. She lived on the Delta at that time and was truly shocked at the authenticity of the physical sets and the attitudes portrayed in this movie. I noticed that the reviews from Southerner's  seem to be more favorable for this movie than those from people in the Northern part of this country. I guess it's one of those things where you have to experience the flavor of the area to appreciate the portrayal of the area. I'm definitely going to buy this and play it for a long time to come.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
649,jebert,A great Coen brothers film,10,29 January 2001,"All Coen Brothers' movies are fantastic in the literal sense of the word, yet they are done with great intelligence, technical skill, attention to detail; and always, strongly, with an overt and subtle sense of humor. A person can easily slip into the flow of the story. This is what happens with O Brother, Where Art Thou?The story takes place in rural Mississippi during the depression years. The costumes, settings and props look so authentic, and the actors are so engaging and play their roles so well, and they are so well directed, that there were times that I forgot that this was a modern film. The Coen brothers' unusual (and often disturbing) sense of humor is in practically every scene of the film. But when the humor is disturbing, as it is in most of their films, there is a reason for it; it is a comment on human weakness and human triumph. Their films are the medieval Morality Plays of the late 20th - early 21st century, and O Brother, Where Art Thou? Is one of their best.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"

653,shykurt,"Golly, Toto, I think we're in Mississippi",10,1 November 2001,"OBWAT is extraordinary fun, as a 1937 Depression-era comic retelling of the travels of Odysseus. While the allusions to Homer are obvious (the Sirens, the Baptist church as the lotus-eaters, the Cyclops, Clooney's first name is Ulysses, his wife is Penelope, she has a ""suitor"",the Gubernatorial candidate/Klan Wizard is named Homer,etc.), the allusions to ""The Wizard of Oz"" are somewhat more subtle: the Oh-we-oh chant and march at the klan meeting, the klan ""wizard,"" the three characters much like the Lion, the Scarecrow, and the Tinman in the rescue scene, Clooney underwater watching objects from his life float past as Dorothy does in the windstorm, etc.The question of course is . . . why? ""The Odyssey"" and ""The Wizard of Oz"" both have main characters obsessed with getting home, and the Coens have built a richly layered entertainment that call upon a range of cultural allusions to make a point.By the way, the movie within OBWAT is ""Myrt and Marge,"" an undistinguished Broadway-backstage movie that features the Three Stooges singing . . . much like the Soggy Bottom Boys.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
654,scutch428,Why isn't this film a hit?,9,14 March 2001,"I don't understand it.  A movie starring George Clooney, written and directed by the Coens, is not a big smash.  I laughed out loud.  I sang out loud?!!  I couldn't believe it.  This movie is hysterical with enough twists and turns to keep you very interested.  A must see, more than just one time.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
655,atquinn1975,"Once again, the Coen brothers do good",8,13 March 2001,"Although I had my reservations about seeing this film, it turned out to be another good offering from the Coen brothers. I've seen all their films except Barton Fink and I've liked them all. If you like the Coen brothers (especially their comedies), you will like this film. If you don't like the Coen brothers, this film probably won't change your mind since it is very much in keeping with their other films.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"

657,ramases2,Superb Film,9,27 June 2006,"I thoroughly enjoyed ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"", but wondered what I was in for when I opted to hire the DVD. The acting, dialogue, settings and scenery were superb. The changing expressions on the faces of the three main actors during the course of the action were priceless. I also loved the music which added greatly to the appreciation of the plot. The songs and choruses that pervade the production reminded me of Greek Theatre as exemplified by the plays of Sophocles or Aeschylus. In Ancient Greek drama the chorus had an important function. It was an emotional bridge between spectators and actors. This came across very vividly during the film and if I'd been in the cinema more so, since one would have been part of an audience. It's an unusual film and I would liked to have seen it on the big screen, but even on DVD it's a spectacular experience.If I have one criticism it is that some of the scene changes were rather abrupt. It results in the viewer having difficulty to connect a scene change with what preceded it - especially as regards the dialogue... but thankfully the songs and choruses maintained the flow of the plot.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
658,wiltonla,One of my top ten fave films,10,13 June 2001,"I've never been the biggest Coen Bros. fan, although I did like Hudsucker Proxy, Fargo and loved Raising Arizona. I was absolutely surprised and thrilled with how much I enjoyed O Brother, Where Art Thou? I'll admit there are some weak bits, but overall it was highly entertaining and very funny, in a sneaky sort of way. The music is used so well. It's a vital element, yet it is used sparingly enough as to keep it from becoming a silly musical. O Brother, Where Art Thou? is definitely not for everybody. Those wholike Julia Roberts/Brad Pitt/Mel Gibson et al mainstream movies will probably be very confused and hate it. Too bad though. This film is brilliant.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
659,gabsal,Some stories are universal,10,17 July 2006,"About the discussion on the South, the rednecks and the hillbillies... Well, I am from the South: Argentina, near the South Pole to be exact. Is this southern enough? Seriously, some stories are universal. We have never been to Greece, nor lived the classic period of Homer, but he speaks to us today. So does Shakespeare and Dante. And stories from far unknown places also reach us, when told with sensibility, intelligence, humor, just like ""O Brother"". Besides, we all (the rest of the world) have our own hillbillies too! And our own depression era (ever heard of Argentina during year 2001?), our politicians and racism, our gentle souls just like Delmar and Tommy... I simply loved this movie, folks. Despite the subtitles, despite being on the other side of the world. (And please forgive my errors in English, I tried my best)PS: I believe nobody quoted this favorite phrase: when Delmar asks George Nelson what does he do for a living, while handling him the machine gun...","O Brother, Where Art Thou"

I liked it very much-but I was busy during the movie and didn't really get to focus on it. Just recently I caught it one day on Dish network and watched it more closely. Now, I can't stop watching, pausing, rewinding, etc. I find more and more things that I missed every time I see it. It is definitely on my all time best movies ever list! The most incredible cast and directing and writing and cinematography! The irony and innuendos and subtleties are absolutely brilliant!

662,AlexM2415,Connection To The Odyssey,6,1 January 2008,"The Coen Brothers were very successful in translating the epic poem The Odyssey into a modern day movie. While adding many changes, they were still able to keep many important plot points. For example, both had a man who wanted to get home to stop someone from marrying his wife. Also, both had a Cyclops, who somehow was able to hurt the protagonist. The Coen Brothers were able to use these details to portray Odysseus as a escaped convict of the 1930s. As well as using similar pieces of the plot, the Coen Brothers showed small details that were similarities to Homer's epic. For example, Odysseus' wife was named Penelope. Ulysses' wife was named Penny. Even the name Ulysses is similar to Odysseus. When adding these small details to the plot points, you realize that the movie O Brother Where Art Thou is a perfect interpretation of the Greek poem The Odyssey.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
663,mfmessina,Not worth watching.,2,12 June 2001,"O Brother, Where Art Thou? was soooo bad, that I wonder why anyone would have bothered paying for an admission ticket to see it at the theater. There was no connection between the title and the plot.  The acting was poor and shallow. The plot was mundane. It was featured as a comedy and didn't make the grade.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
664,ANTHONY_WADDELL,Why did the cows have to Die?,1,16 June 2001,"This movie is straight up bad.  My friends all recommended this movie, and I was hugely disappointed.  This was terrible.  I studied the Odyssey, and I'll stick with the classic text.  The scenery was bland and dull (don't care if meant something).  Nothing about this film was funny.  The straw that broke the camel's back was the shooting of the cows by ""Jimmy"" from the practice.  Why?  I realize that my steak and burgers come from a violent process, but that scene in the movie stirred up my hatred for this poor excuse of a film.  The music was horrible.  Thankfully Blockbuster let me exchange the movie that night for Men of Honor, which was a fabulous film. There was absolutely no redeeming quality in this movie. The dialogue was elementary, and the overall quality was poor at best.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
665,dwestbro,brilliant American allegory,9,27 June 2001,"So it's a steamy night, with rain and after day of driving, with a funeral . . . a night for which my wife chose the perfect movie, the Coen brothers' ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?""  Loosely but explicitly based on the Odyssey, it tracks three escaped prisoners across a Depression-era Mississippi, a land of strange magic, much singing, and no little amount of horror.Among other things, a wonderful meditation on American modernity, and on how the future both displaces yet depends on the past.  Very Southern literary theme, of course, but difficult to film.  And I've not seen the importance of and ambiguous role played by music (much of it from the South, either directly or via Chicago, etc.) in defining mass modern culture, so that music is both broadcast yet expected to be authentic.. .A similarly complex role is played by water.  As in the late 60's movie Deliverance (and in China today, where the Three Gorges Dam is planned to be the largest civil engineering project in human history) a decisive role is played by government project to dam a river.  Deliverance was written by the southern poet & novelist James Dickey, concerned with such traditional southern themes.  [Not exactly incidentally, I've spent time on the headwaters of the Chattooga, the Class IV/V Wild & Scenic River where Deliverance was filmed (somebody was killed during filming, if memory serves).]  The flooding that concerns Dickey, of course, is mostly TVA (though the Chattooga flows to the Savannah & Atlantic, andis therefore outside TVA authority).  In Brother, as Clooney makes clear, water sweeps away the old and ushers in the new, by providing hydroelectric power.  But as the same scene elegantly shows, this is hardly a rational process.The weather.  As with most things Greek, one senses the power of the sun.  And as with most things Southern, one senses the shadows, the underbrush scraping on skin that seems to have been sweaty always . ..This movie, as well as a few others I've liked recently, notably Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and American Beauty, seem to me to have learned the lessons of magical realism, and are now employing those lessons in a more frankly mystical/allegorical/thoughtful way.  But ""Brother"" does so in a way that recalls the musical -- everybody can sing -- if musicals were composed of spooky delta music, almost all a capella, sung by black and white Greek chorus/choirs of angels, which makes sense in Mississippi.The movie is not perfect.  George Clooney, as the protagonist, delivers a performance that would be quite good in a lesser movie, but simply doesn't match the brilliance of this movie.  The romantic plot doesn't quite work.  I could go on, but won't bother.  It is a great movie.So, if you haven't seen it, wait till a muggy afternoon, calling for rain.  Turn off the air conditioner.  Do something sweaty.  Skip the shower and fry up something, catfish if you can get them.  Or okra. After dinner, pour yourself a stiff warm whisky, preferrably a coffee mug full.  And enjoy.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"

He said dude you have to watch this, this is the funniest movie you have ever seen. Looking back I cannot deny that comment. Not only is it one of the funniest movies I've ever seen but it gets better every time I watch it. My favorite parts are the part with him commenting on his hair all the time.

I'm not a big fan of American films, and not a fan of George Clooney either. I usually loathe that kind of music, and the thought of the South during the depression gives me the shudders. But, the music was great, the film was very funny, the KKK scene made my hair stand on end (it isn't really anything like that,is it?), even George Clooney was wonderful. I don't think I've ever been so pleasantly surprised by a film.I loved it. I saw it at the cinema on Thursday, and rented the video on Saturday.What else can I say?","O Brother, Where Art Thou"

(And isn't he just underrated anyway? Yes, he is like Tom Selleck, but Clooney ACTS!) I will recommend this adamantly to all who have an interest in great movies.

673,natkat,One of 2000's best!,10,24 August 2001,"A sheer delight!  This Coen brothers film takes wit, and whimsy to a new level.  One doesn't have to be a scholar of Homer's ""Odyssey"", or even be acquainted with it's framework to enjoy this retelling of a near-impossible journey.  To credit Ethan Coen's writing solely with the movie's success is irresponsible;  the writing alone does not carry the movie.  Rather, ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" sees fine-tuned performances from George Clooney, Tim Blake Nelson, and John Turturro; playful, mood-rendering cinematography; easy-handed direction from Joel Coen; AND Ethan Coen's adept recreation of Homer work together as a well-oiled machine.  If just one of these aspects of the movie was neglected, the film would have remained watchable; however, it would have failed to be the piece of cinematic candy that it is.  Highly recommended.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
674,louwrenswiese,On my Top Ten,9,8 December 2006,OK. I completely love the Coen Brothers. They can do no wrong. They are the scoundrel analysts of the human soul. The world is not to be taken too seriously and they know it. And they can persuade actors to be as great as they can be. But they don't make funny ha-ha movies. You will cry as much as you laugh. From the deep empathy they show to every creation. And all of this this happens in Oh Brother. George Clooney who already has that glint in his eye that a leading man needs is now granted humility and desperation. Which his jail suit complements perfectly. Are there not at least ten 'characters' in this movie you will never forget? People you will see on the streets from now onwards. But you never knew they existed before these geniuses pointed them out to you. Hail Coen Brothers.,"O Brother, Where Art Thou"

Give it a chance, watch it more than once, there are a lot of key elements that shape the story that could be missed the first and even second time watching it. The Cohen brothers brilliantly weave actual happenings of the early 20th century into this story to make a believable setting and storyline. The combination of Clooney's leading role blends well with Turturro and Nelson's supporting acts. John Goodman's appearance in the movie is hilarious. The soundtrack is great as well.

I have now seen this movie well over a hundred times, and I still laugh every time I watch it, partly from memories of those Guard guys with their hysterical accents, and partly because it's just such a great movie.It is not often that a comedy can be so smart, beautiful, and funny at the same time. I love how the Coen brothers capture music in their films. Using authentic music of the area and time is so much better than a standard orchestra.Please watch this movie!

685,giggles5367,vs. The Odyssey,7,25 December 2007,"""O Brother Where Art Thou"" is an offbeat movie that strays from the usual Hollywood mold. It is entertaining and refreshing, yet misleading. The movie claims to be based on Homer's The Odyssey, but this is barely true. As of thirty minutes into the movie the plot references were barely evident. During the opening credits the connection is stated, yet for a good portion of time that is the only inclination to any similarities. In addition, the biggest connection between the two stories is the movie's allusions to the book, not the similarities in the plot. There are some plot connections, but they are different enough to change the story. Also, most of the connections are through words. For example, the only reference to Charybdis and Scylla is George Clooney's repetition of the phrase ""We're in a tight spot"" and there is no plot reference to this. This is one of several examples of the use of language to convey the similarities. Overall, the movie was good even though it was not exactly what it had claimed to be. It is difficult to determine whether The Odyssey translates well into a modern day movie based on ""O Brother Where Art Thou"". This is because the movie is not completely based on the epic. Based on the movie at hand, The Odyssey translated well due to the creativity required to translate it. The Coen Brothers needed a great deal of creativity to translate several monsters and situations into a modern-day scenario. This led to clever and different situations such as the one-eyed bible sales man, the seductive Sirens, the tidal wave and so on. These were referring to Odysseus' encounters with Polyphemus, the Sirens and Athena's help. The Coen Brothers were geniuses for having the ability to successfully translate one of the oldest stories into an entertaining modern-day film.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
686,zdrummer10,"Relating this movie to ""The Odyssey""",6,26 December 2007,"The Coen Brothers successfully transformed the epic poem, ""The Odyssey"" into a movie through their full screen spectacle, O Brother Where Art Thou? For example, both pieces begin with blind prophets who describe future occurrences through predictions. In O Brother Where Art Thou? the prophet is revealed to be the blind man on the train tracks, predicting the future of the three fugitives. In ""The Odyssey"", there are many prophets, such as Muse, Theoclymenes, Helen and Tiresias who often describe the impending doom of the suitors and Odysseus' return. In addition, in both pieces there are sirens who attempt to stir the main characters' supporting crew. In O Brother Where Art Thou? the sirens are located at a lake, persuading Pete to follow them leading to his eventual arrest. In ""The Odyssey"", the sirens are directly in the path of Odysseus on his way home. They attempt to persuade him to follow them, but his crew strictly restrains him and they eventually pass through unharmed. Thirdly, both pieces contain a strong antagonist (Cyclops) who approaches the main characters kindly and quickly turn hostile. In O Brother Where Art Thou? this antagonist is represented by the one-eyed Big Dan. He kindly tells them that he is willing to sell them atonement for their sins through the bible, and turns hostile by physically assaulting them and killing their frog. In ""The Odyssey"", the antagonist is represented by the Cyclops who begins his part in the story as a hospitable creature, but later turns hostile when eating two of Odysseus' crew mates.In addition to the meeting of the two Cyclops's, both pieces of work show the physical pain caused by the protagonist on the antagonist. In O Brother Where Art Thou? during the Ku Klux Klan meeting, big Dan is killed by Evrett when the flaming cross falls on him. In ""The Odyssey"", Odysseus blinds the Cyclops with a flaming spear during his imprisonment in the Cyclops' cave. Another similarity between the two pieces is the protagonist's wife's plan to remarry. In O Brother Where Art Thou? Evrett's wife, Penny plans on remarrying a suitor. In ""The Odyssey"", Odysseus' wife, Penelope plans on remarrying one of the many suitors occupying her home. Lastly, in both pieces, the main character enlists the help of his friends before the final, eventful scene. In O Brother Where Art Thou? Evrett promises loyalty and fair treatment to Pete and Delmar before entering the church and trying to stop the wedding. In ""The Odyssey"", Odysseus promises to treat the cowherd and swineherd as children if they aid him in his final battle with the suitors. In conclusion, the similarities between the two pieces of work prove the successful translation from ""The Odyssey"" to O Brother Where Art Thou? I am a total buttface","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
687,Mahwongtonsoup,"Comparison: O Brother, Where Art Thou? to The Odyssey",6,31 December 2007,"In the Movie, O Brother, Where Art Thou?, it successfully translates the epic, The Odyssey, into a more modern perspective. To start, both of the stories begin in the middle. In the Odyssey, it starts with Odysseus trapped on Calypso's island, and then it explains the previous events. Also, the three men from O Brother, Where Art Thou?, are escaping a labor farm without explaining how they got there. Both main characters are embarked on a seemingly impossible journey. Odysseus must travel across oceans to return home to his family, and Everett escapes from the chain gang with the help of his loyal, yet ignorant friends, Pete and Delmar. Odysseus also had followers, or a crew, and at times there are parallels to the foolishness of Odysseus' crew and Everretts friends Pete and Delmar. Odysseus' crew for example were the ones who cut open the bag of winds, which blew their ship off course, and they also killed cows that belonged to Helios, the god of Sun. Consequently, Pete is the one who led the trio to the sirens, who seduced the three, taking Pete.Another Parallel between the Odyssey and O Brother, Where Art Thou? is that the Antagonist in both works first appears to be hospitable, but turns out to hostile. Polyphemus for example welcomed Odysseus and his crew, but soon enough was swallowing his men whole. Also, Big Dan had a picnic with Everett and Delmar and making business with them. Suddenly he is clubbing them both with a large branch and taking their money. One of the most notable similarities is the Planning, or the idea of the main characters wife remarrying. Penelope, Odysseus' wife is plagued by the marriage-thirsty suitors. A coincidence is that Penny, Everett's wife is similar to the name Penelope, which is Odysseus' wife. Also, both Odysseus and Everett disguised themselves in order to get close to their wives and make sure they don't remarry. What seems to be another coincidence is that both Penny and Penelope doubt that the concealed man is actually their husband. Finally, it seems peculiar how both stories are portrayed in almost a foreign worlds, with the different lingo and phrases as well as customs and motives. With the numerous parallels in both plot and theme, The Coen Brothers Successfully translated the epic, The Odyssey, into a more modern film, O Brother, Where Art Thou?-DwizzleP.S.

I have heard people talk about this movie and they either love it or they hate it.  As with their movie, ""Fargo"", it is more about the characters during the journey they take than the ludicrous story that is laid out. If you are the type of person that gets stuck on the story without recognizing the subtle nuances presented visually, symbolically, and verbally then don't bother.  You will miss the point entirely.  I recommend this movie highly....so sit back and enjoy the purity of the characters created by the Coen brothers and the skilled actors that play them so wonderfully.

692,jbeckert,peculiar but very enjoyable,9,6 April 2003,"Very odd comedy/adventure movie. I really enjoyed the quirky characters and slightly surreal feel to the whole movie. (Slight spoiler?) One funny touch was how the movie begins with the main characters on a chain gang, and when we later see his children, there are so many that the mother has them tagging along behind her tied to a string, chain gang style.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
693,dns5078,"Box-Office Flop, Great Comedy",8,14 October 2008,"This Coen brothers film may have been a flop in the box-office, but anyone who is just in the mood for a great, light-hearted comedy should check out this film. It certainly may not always be PC, but for those that love a little coarse comedy will appreciate the fun in this film. George Clooney may not have put his deepest character forward, but what a shot at comedy. Not to let out the twist on a classic Homer odyssey, but even without catching inspiration to this plot it is still something worth the viewers time. Just a little disclaimer to my endorsement though, those that are easily offended should not sit in the utter hope of loving this film because it does play off of so many stereotypes.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
694,cswignes,A highly underrated comedy and Cohen Classic,10,27 June 2005,"Another outstanding movie by the Coen Bros. While their style remains similar, there appeal can be hit and miss. This movie is right on target. This is a rare film that combines excellent casting, superb cinematography and well acted roles. And the best part about this movie is how much more your liking and respect for it grows the more you watch. Never before have I found myself so engrossed in a dialogue driven movie. Every viewing brings new laughs and exposes new subtleties that I was sure I caught. George Clooney firmly establishes himself capable of acting in a comedic role. Fans of Dennis Miller will certain appreciate the ""intelligent humor"" this movie provides and Coen Brother fans should have a new personal favorite. And a small suggestion from this end. If you didn't find it funny the first time, turn on the captions and grab a dictionary. You'll be rolling by the time the boys are ""in a tight spot!""","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
695,ddclarke,A wonderful twist on the Odessey,10,3 April 2004,"This is a great movie! If you are looking for something that is smart, witty and funny, O' Brother is it. I'm not a huge fan of Clooney but he is wonderful in this film. He will make you laugh all the way through.  John Goodman, John Turturro and Tim Black Nelson are perfection! The writing and acting is excellent. Unlike the Big Lebowski, the Coen brothers did a wonderful job with this film!","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
696,bkirk-1,"Great Movie, very entertaining.",10,21 May 2003,"Well, I had my doubts when I decided to watch it, but I found that the music of this movie really made it unique, I found myself waiting for the next musical number, George Clooney did a great job on a character that he dosen't usually play.  I give it a 9.5 out of 10, and would recommend it to all!!!","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
697,johndicke,simply excellent,10,18 March 2010,"This is my favorite movie of all time and one of only a few I can watch over and over. I have watched it with my boys (who are now grown) at least a dozen times. It fits well into history and Coen does a great job of developing the characters. I love bluegrass, gospel, and country music, so that doesn't hurt my opinion (since the movie is loaded with all). The actors are superb, and there is a ""favorite line"" for everyone. The music is good, the plot keeps moving, and there is never a dull moment. If for some crazy reason you haven't seen it, it's time to rent the DVD and pop some pop corn....or better yet, buy it; you may want to watch again and again.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
698,selineh,Wacky musical comedy,9,27 February 2004,"This movie really surprised me.  Who would think of placing a retelling of the Odyssey in the South in the 1930's?  But the story really works.  I was surprised at George Clooney's fantastic performance as the fast-talking, vain and heartsick jailbreak mastermind.  He's not only lovable, he's admirable, especially because (or despite the fact that) he accomplishes all the right things in all the wrong ways.  Holly Hunter is also hilarious as his wife Penny: ""I've said my piece and counted to three!""
The soundtrack is very endearing, and you fill probably find yourself humming the tunes for days later.Overall, I thought this was a very funny movie, though perhaps not as good as Fargo.  But definitely one you will want to see twice, if you see it at all.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
699,matthewhylnd,"Plot, Cinematic elements and relations to Homers ""The Odyssey""",10,16 March 2011,"O Brother, Where art Thou? This movie is a comedy with a strange plot. The movie has household name actors playing very weird roles. The theme in this movie is one of an ill advised adventure which ends in disaster. The movie is set in the Deep South during the 1930's. The depression is in full swing and the scenes of the movie depict a desperate time in American history.There are three stars in this movie George Clooney, Everett, John Turturro, Pete, and Tim Blake Nelson, Delmar. The movie centers around these three escape convicts who are the search for a hidden treasure. These hapless characters find adventure in many different ways such as a seductive episode at a river bed, a short lived radio broadcasting career, and an unbelievable ending to the wacky adventure. Although these adventures are side tracks to the real plot of finding the treasure that Everett so desperately wants to steal.A few of the cinematic elements are music and editing. The music relates to the popular song the trio sang ""Man of Constant Sorrow"". They assumed the stage name of the Soggy Bottom Boys. In the movie this was a hit, but also in real life this song was played all over the radio. I wonder if it was more of a joke than actual talent but none the less it was entertaining. The second cinematic element that makes the movie a success is the editing. There are scenes in the movie where the scene cuts away and when it returns it leaves some question as to what actually happened. This is most evident in the Siren's scene by the river.The movie is accidentally based off the story by Homer ""The Odyssey"". I have read many reports that the writers did not intend it to resemble The Odyssey. The similarities are vague and were changed enough to not be an exact copy of The Odyssey. However, one cannot deny that the subtle changes in the movie resembles Homers classic tale. I am sure that is Homer was alive he would have been thrilled that his story became a Hollywood spectacle.In conclusion, I think that this is a top notch movie to watch. The adventure for the trio is surely ill advised but considering their alternative it seemed like a good idea. It has comedy that will make you laugh, action to make your heart race, and an ending that is unpredictable.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
700,bennin04,O Brother Where Art Thou?,9,18 March 2011,"O Brother Where Art Thou? Is a comedy satire based on the historical writing of Homer's Odyssey. Directed by Joel and Ethan Coen, the film stars George Clooney (Everett) John Turturro (Pete), Tim Blake Nelson (Delmar). The movie is set in the Deep South during the great depression. The three main characters are trying to break free from the Mississippi State Prison. The ring leader is Everett and he convinces the other two to break free in hopes to find a buried treasure that they must get to in four days before it is washed away. The movie provides plenty of different adventures for the trio all the while they are being chased by Sheriff Cooley and they must stay one step ahead of the law while still maintaining their moral. The characters hope the blind mans prophecy will come true!This movie offers a new and exciting way to view and interpret. The film offer a wide variety of angle shots and uses panning often to show the events that played out earlier to show how and why the characters end up in the predicaments that they do. Music and transitions are used in comparison to guide the audience thorough rough and rowdy scenes, to naturally flowing scenes. This is done in such a way that the audience doesn't even know, giving more attention to be paid on the film itself. During the trios adventure they are constantly being followed by Sheriff Cooley. When such scenes are present in the film, the transition and editing is tenser and the music reflects. Also in happier times in the film, the trio performs as the Soggy Bottom Boys with much popularity.The music reflect this as well. The lighting and color are used in such a way in the film to represent the sepia tone feeling that was popular during that time period. This movie is very fun and exciting to watch. It offers a modern day twist on the odyssey and the Coen Brothers keep you guessing at what will happen next. I recommend this movie to anyone! It offers a great storyline for young and old alike!","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
701,ashley_hartlepool,Just didn't do it for me.,3,25 June 2011,"I watched this film because i was told that ""i would be crying with laughter"" instead i barley laughed once. The main characters were just awful. You had two stupid characters(Pete and Delmar) and one intelligent character(Everett). Usually this could work but Pete and Delmar were so stupid it simply was not funny, it was like they only knew about 20 words and half the time it was just Everett talking and them looking back gormless. The only thing positive about the film was it had some catchy songs. I would not go out of my way to watch this film nor would i recommend it to anyone, if it's on TV and it's a Sunday and you can not find the remote then by all means watch it but otherwise its a big No.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
702,Fred_Flynn,An all time Classic,7,15 January 2004,"I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw negative reviews of this classic film. An amazing period piece, it's hilarious.

704,babyblues06109,Great and humerous! WATCH IT!!!!,10,31 January 2004,"I found Oh brother where art thou to be great!!! It was really funny and really showed the Odyssey in it. It had many of the characters from it like the sirens, the cyclops, and The Lotus eater!! There are also great quotes and the people are extremely humerous. You will not stop laughing. one of my favorite quotes was ""they loved him up and turned him into a horney toad!"" (this was when Pete disappeared) from my opinion this is a great movie!!!!","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
705,Pyrrah,"Funny, great music, a film to see!",10,5 March 2004,"O Brother, Where Art Thou? is probably one of my favorites films! I love it!!! It´s about a prisoner called Everett(played by George Clooney) who has buried a treasure before he went to jail. He is chained with two men called Pete(John Turturro) and Delmar(Tim Blake Nelson). Now they are gonna bust out and dig up the treasure and split it. Everything takes place in the south during the depression. It´s a wonderful story lined with problems. The film is based on Homers The Odyssey... This film is one of many reasons why The Coen´s stays in the business! You have to see it. You will fall in love with the music(!!!)and the sights will stay with you forever and ever. It´s also very, very, very funny! I only have two words: See it!","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
706,mindful,Intelligent and Intellectual,10,3 April 2004,"This is one of the very rare movies: intelligent, intellectual, wise and witty. It has many layers, so it can offer food for thought for people of different intellectual abilities. One can read it as a complicated book: for some it is a story of three men in their pursuit for life, for some it is a story of the South, for some it is an interpretation of a classic Homerian tale, for some it is a Biblical parable...  I praise Coen brothers for their Hollywood nonconformism, wackiness, unpredictability, intellectualism. Each movie is a gem in a muggy homogeneous water of standard movies. Thanks to Coen brothers people who are adverse to Hollywood ignorance and commercial greed have an incentive to visit movie theater.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
707,jabogie,it didnt do much for me,4,11 April 2004,"ok most people seemed to like this movie, but personally I hated it.  I know it is a parody of the Oddysey, but i didnt notice too many similarities.  Also, the whole idea that three guys break out of a chain gang seeking treasure and somehow manage to create a blue grass band that becomes very well liked just doesn't make much sense. The fact that the whole movie has blue grass music in it does not do much for me.  I have heard it has been recognized for its music, but if you aren't a big bluegrass fan, then this moive can be somewhat of a turn off as it was for me.  I don't really care for George Clooney in a not serious role.  I think he is a very fine actor in Oceans Eleven, but as a convict, he isn't too convincing.  This movie recieved two and a half stars from ebert and roper or whoever and frankly i would have to agree with the rating.  To me, O Brother Where Art Thou was simply a mediocre movie.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
708,damian16,short one,9,18 June 2004,"It's another terrific Coen movie. It might be classified as a drama, yet in my opinion it's both drama and comedy. The story is situated in EEUU in the 1920's, however, it is based on Homer's 'Odyssey'. Three escaped convicts looking for an inexistent huge sum of money, go through hilarious adventures and meet very strange real and non-real people as bankrobber George 'Babyface' Nelson, sirens, a fast talking one eye bible seller and a lot of the KKK members. It's got excellent characters and beautiful landscapes. Clooney and Turturro have very good performances. The soundtrack is one of the best i've ever know.Worth seeing","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
709,osborn29,The Voyage,8,8 December 2012,"The film starts out with three men Everett, Pete and Delmar. Everett is played by George Cloony, Pete is played by John Tuturro, and Delmar is played by Tim Blake Nelson. The three men are in prison together and shackled at the foot and Everett comes up with this wonderful idea that he has a hidden treasure and the three of them should break out of prison and find it so that is what they did. The three of them overcome many obstacles while in search for the ""treasure"". Pete and Delmar then realize there was no treasure it is strictly Everett trying to prevent his ex-wife from becoming eloped again. The theme of the movie is very comical and it keeps you laughing the entire time. Everett, Pete, and Delmar learn a lot throughout the obstacle the first thing they encounter on their voyage was a blind man which tells them their future while receiving a ride from him the future that he comes up with for the men is that they are going to find a treasure but it isn't going to be the treasure that they are intending to find. The men end up sleeping in a barn and the authorities that are trying to find the men find out about it so they set the barn that they are sleeping in on fire. The men then go running through the woods and they cite a baptism without truly knowing much about it they get in line and receive the father, ghost, and the Holy Spirit. The men come across a radio station where they get on the radio as the Soggy Bottom Boys but they aren't about to sign their names so they just write X's they don't want the authorities to be able to hunt them down. The men also get involved in a bank robbery with Baby Face Nelson which has completed robberies several times. Everett and Delmar believe that Pete has been turned into a frog and they later find out that he was caught. Pete and Delmar find out that Everett was lying to them about the treasure he was just trying to get his ex-wife back before she got remarried but when they arrived to Penny she was interested in having Everett back and she told their kids that he was dead because she was ashamed about what Everett did. In the end Everett got his way and got Penny back. The movie was very well put together and it was a lot like the Odyssey. The movie made you feel like you were actually in the Great Depression due to the lighting and they well put together scenes.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
710,c-mullis,(Spoiler Alert!) The trio definitely offers a bit of education on some hard lessons of life.,10,6 December 2012,"The plot of this film features George Clooney as Everett McGill pursuing and ambitious goal. Everett and two of his counterparts, Pete (John Tuturro) and Delmar (Tim Blake Nelson), escape from prison and embark on a false mission of finding a treasure. Their mission, in actuality, is Everett's selfish desire to keep his ex-wife from marrying someone else. Their adventure leads them into very troubling and dangerous scenarios. All the while, the three are pursued by a tenacious law dog (Sherriff Cooley) who catches up with the defying trio on a few occasions.Much akin to the theme of ""The Breakfast Club"", the apparent theme of this film centers on numerous characters learning hard lessons of life and watching the changing of morality amongst the people they run into. One good example of this theme is when Big Dan Teeg (John Goodman) begins an exuberant sales pitch to Everett and convinces two of them to join him on a pick nick luncheon. While enjoying the pleasantries of the lunch setting, he attacks both of them and takes their money. Another clear example of this theme is when the trio runs into the ""Sirens"" washing their clothing in the river bed. The ignorance of the three of them leads them into a trap and causes one to be turned into the authorities. They awake stunned and perplexed as to what happened.The lighting and color techniques of the movie really add to the realism of the dust bowl era that the film is set during. This adds to the challenge portrayed by the characters during their several scenarios of conflict. A prevalent motif, or symbolic repetition, that occurs throughout the course of the film is represented by the character obstacles of Big Dan, the Sheriff, and the Ku Klux Klan leader. At each point that the characters seem to make progress on their mission, or rather Everett's mission, these symbolic obstacles are placed in their paths which sets them onto the next scene with some knowledge obtained.This film is a must see and keeps you involved in the mood and setting. There is plenty of portrayal of comic relief, wit, and other emotion to keep you interested. The trio definitely offers a bit of education on some hard lessons of life.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
711,stalli06,Positive,8,15 December 2012,"O' Brother Where Art Thou (2000) is a movie about three guys on a chain gang that escape. Everett McGill played by George Clooney convinces the two guys he is chained with, Pete played by John Turturro and Del Mar played by Tim Blake Nelson, to escape with him. Everett deceived the pair by telling them that he had money buried from a heist that he would share with them.The trio meets up with a blind man that tells them the treasure they seek may not be the treasure they find. There are many obstacles that the trio must face on their journey. Big Dan played by John Goodman beats them up and leaves them for dead, the trio narrowly escapes the KKK and even Pete's cousin Wash tries to turn them in for a reward while all the time they are being pursued by Sheriff Cooley. The theme of the movie is about being flexible along life's road; when on a path to a certain destination remain open to other roads that may lead to success. This is conveyed by the blind man the trio meets. As the story unfolds the trio becomes successful when they meet up with Tommy and decide to record a song with him; little do they know that this will be what makes them rich and gets them pardoned by the governor. This is exactly what the blind man's prediction was conveying! The use of sound when the trio hops the train conveys the successful escape. The scene where the trio watches the blind man move down the track gives the audience a chance to contemplate the words he spoke to them. Another element that led to the movie's success was the soundtrack it was on the top selling list for years after the movie's release. The time period is conveyed by the colors in the movie. The other effective element is the way the characters talk with the Mississippi drawl. Every time I see this movie I am reminded of Butch Cassidy and the Sun Dance Kid. The two very different groups are trying to escape criminal charges but neither group really appears to be criminals of their own choosing. I think each group is a victim of desperate times; they are trying to survive destitution. It was a funny movie with many twists and turns that teach life lessons. The trio was always on the move experiencing many of life's surprises. The last disaster the trio faces is what keeps them safe. I think the storyline conveys the desperate times back in the years following the great depression. According to IMDb there was an inaccuracy, the boy with the gun says he shot at a census taker but the census is only taken in tenth years; i.e. 1930 or 1940.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
712,a-sharp2007,Did I see the same movie?,2,14 July 2005,"I am a huge fan of the Coen Brothers and am constantly introducing people to ""Raising Arizona,"" one of the most underrated comedies ever.I went into ""O Brother"" with high expectations---the Coens, John Turturro, John Goodman, even Holly Hunter. I could even manage George Clooney under the sure hand of the Coens.But this movie is AWFUL. NOT funny, except in about five (very short) places. Dull, dull, dull. Way too many drawn-out scenes with blues or bluegrass music playing over ""depression"" scenes, with absolutely nothing happening. About an hour into the movie, I was experiencing the worst feeling possible during a movie---I just wanted it to be over.The completely pointless interaction with George Nelson (don't call him ""Babyface"") was a waste of Michael Badalucco's talents. Holly Hunter? She was in the credits, but was not in the movie, essentially.I laughed four times during the whole movie: (Here are the spoilers) When John Goodman hit George Clooney with the stick; during the ""Do not seek the treasure"" scene; during the original singing scene at the radio station; and at John Turturro's dancing during the final singing scene.Don't waste your time unless, as I did, you HAVE to see this at the behest of a girlfriend.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"

It still amazes meI was first introduced to this excellent movie through the soundtrack album, which I loved, but than I watched the film. It is now one of my favorite Coen films. (Though, that isn't a fair comparison as I have only seen this, ""True Grit"" and ""Raising Arizona"") The performances are classic, especially George Clooney as the slick protagonist Everett, obsessed with Dapper Dan hair grease and his wife, Penny. (""Damn! Were in a tight spot!"" is my favorite quote.) Tim Blake Nelson also deserves praise for his portrayal as Delmar. Blake Nelson portrays an idiot very well and the Coen's script gives him the best lines of the movie. (This is my favorite, ""We'll I'll only be 82!"") The beautiful photography by Roger Deakins (who also helped ILM on the beautiful animation for ""Rango"") captures the feel of 1937 Mississippi perfectly with his digitally colored shots. They fit so well with the story that they are inseparable. It is a great hoot watching this eclectic assortment of The Odyssey, country music, southern folklore, and great humor.The most perfect part of this film is the ending. The flooding of the valley with the harmonies of the Fairfield Four would be good enough. but the details makes into a great piece of art.A sea of Dapper Dan cans! The drowning hound and the ""happy little tire swing""! The cow on the cotton house! Clooney's monologue about the new south! Roll-top desk! Holly Hunter's line:""This isn't my ring"" The kids on the twine leash! And the blind prophet on a handcar singing ""Angel Band"" as he rides away into the distance.

If you like comedy and you are willing to laugh as hard as you can imagine, then this is the movie for you. This movie shows the lives of three young men who escaped from jail in Mississippi and are trying to find a lost treasure. Their names are Everett, Delmar and Pete. The theme for this movie would be finding a peaceful place with a little bit of struggle. I choose this theme because it explains how Everett, Delmar and Pete were unhappy at the prison station and needed to find some form of peaceful place; and through it all they are willing to put in all they have got just to be happy. This movie will keep you entertained the whole time. It is definitely a must watch!!!","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
715,kizzymoto,I love this movie!!,10,26 April 2005,"Being a true Southerner(NC)and having parents that grew up in that era, it is a treat to see how close the Coens come to getting it right. Granted there is some stereotyping and bias, but only a person that has a true feeling of the times can appreciate it. One thing that I loved that at times, color was the least of the problems that the boys faced. Times were tough and it made people hard, but still they could find joy in simple things. The music flows beautifully and is integrated into the story so well. George Clooney proved that he could act, and Tim Blake Nelson stole the show with his simplicity. John Turturro was funny and the rest of the cast proved up to the challenge of being Southern.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"

Sure, it gives a good picture of the South in the 30's and the music suited the movie. But the rest is too vague for me and didn't make me laugh either. And what about the part when they get robbed by John Goodman, they just sit there and have their heads whacked and money stolen?? I thought George was supposed to be the clever one. And all the ""coincidences"" like the sirens and the KKK meeting and the political meeting. Looked more like a southern 30's Blues Brothers. Don't take me wrong, i like American movies, but this was just not my style.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
717,leyla4601,Wonderful movie - deep and meaningful,8,16 January 2005,"This movie really had it all - meaning, humor, great acting, wonderful writing. I was very impressed with the quality of the direction and the screenplay, both of which brought out a uniquely adapted ""Odyssey"". The film's cinematography captures the essence of the '30s, and, contrary to its slapstick front, makes some very important points about US history, social circles, and cultural heritage. O Brother, Where Art Thou is one of the 15 movies I own simply because of how effective I found it. Watching it reminds me of the first time I saw Gladiator and the way I questioned my world-view, seeing deeper meaning to the mundane things around me. In Gladiator, the mundane was represented by the feel of wheat shafts on one's palm vividly represented in Russell Crowe's dreams of his home; in this film, the simple landscape that forms each scene brings to mind how important it is to just stop and appreciate the little things.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"

720,newssouth,"The References honoring LOUISIANA, Texas, MISSISSIPPI and the rest of the SOUTH.",10,17 March 2005,"The movie seems to contain more references to more things than just about any movie I have ever seen or heard about.The many references to Homer's ""The Odyssey"" are well-known and mentioned in many places on this fabulous site (thank you IMDb).But the references to the south come in a close second to Homer's epic, though they aren't noted as often. I'd like to help change that, and invite others to add their comments.The movie takes place in MISSISSIPPI.The character Charles Durning plays - Pappy O'Daniel - was the actual governor of Texas (1938-1942), was in fact a flour baron, and toured with a band (that's STILL playing together, albeit with new members as well as some of the original ones) called the Lightcrust Doughboys, who specialized in Texas Swing and other old-Tyme music.One song that shows up twice - at critical junctures in the movie - is ""You are my Sunshine,"" the official state song of LOUISIANA, that was penned by a real LOUISIANA governor: Jimmie Davis, who lived to be 101 years old and lived in THREE different centuries ! As Durning's character walks into the radio station in the movie, one of his assistants mentions "" . . . every parish and precinct . . ."" involved in his election campaign for governor.The ONLY state where there are ""parishes and precincts"" is LOUISIANA - all of the other 49 states have ""counties and precincts"" as their political subdivisions.The flooding of the valley recalls the TVA in Tennessee.There must be more references that others know about concerning their state or area.

This is probably really enjoyable if you're the sort of bluffer that plays audio of silence and gets really into it and tells people it was the best music you've heard in years when in fact it was silence.

The Odysseian framework of the story enables an easy transition into a mythical spiritual journey to self awareness and the power of being and love. Far and away Clooney's best performance. The music contained in the movie is one of American legend. From the ""crossroads"" tales of Robert Johnson, the Bible belt gospel of Alison Krauss, and the other songs which still today defy categorization, such as ""Man of Constant Sorrow"" and ""Didn't Leave Nobody but the Baby"", by an array of artists who themselves easily fall outside the pigeonholes. This is the stirring Homerian epic of Americana. Magic like this only happens once, yet I thirst for more.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
724,jf-11905,"Misunderstood, yet easy to watch",8,24 September 2019,"Well, This movie obviously isn't the next titanic, however it is, to be remembered, a different genre.People who watch this and expect a meaningful plot will be disappointed. BUT for those who can enjoy George Clooney in this unfamiliar role, yet brilliant character, and see how the coen brothers was a bit playful when directing the movie, it will be a very pleasant and entertaining surprise.This movie delivered in many laughable ways but somehow still managed to obtain just the right amount of seriousness.More or less, it is a movie I would watch again within five years, and definitely a movie to be recommended for others to watch.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
725,tez-17,One of My Top Movies of all time,9,24 July 2005,"This is one of those films you can watch over and over again always finding new things to laugh at. I keep this in my all time favorites case. I didn't want to see this for a long time because I though it mocking Christianity but was glad to be wrong this time. The music and humor are timeless and very well done. I have never bought soundtracks until this movie came out. If you don't like this movie i would say it reveals something about your character, you likely have difficulty enjoying many aspects of life and take yourself far too seriously. It is a beautifully shot film. I hope this write up helps creates more fans for me to be in fellowship with. TEZ","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
726,karenmcmahon,If you didn't like it the first time watch it again.,10,8 September 2005,"As with other Coen brothers films (such as Raising Arizona) I would have rated this below a 5 after the first viewing. However, after a re-viewing this has definitely proved an excellent film.Many comedies are only funny the first time and then become a joke you've already heard. Oh Brother IS re-playable with it's rich dialog, great ""old-timey"" soundtrack, symbolism, foreshadowing, and subtle (at times) humor.The dialog is HILARIOUS! The Oracle's speech is truly prophetic for all men. Tim Blake Nelson is either really an idiot or a superb actor-notice the constant expression. Clooney is good comedian; and if you're a Coen fan you probably already love Turturro.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
727,warren_coburn,Road trip comedy adventure,8,25 March 2017,"In the deep south during the 1930's an odd-ball trio of convicts, led by George Clooney, escape from a chain-gang, and embark on a perilous road-trip with the intent to retrieve Clooney's hidden bank loot. While the law are relentless in their pursuit, the convicts encounter a number of strange characters and experiences! Loosely based on Homer's 'Odyssey.'","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
728,djbanana,Nice,7,19 October 2020,"O Brother, Where Art Thou? follows the story of three escaped convicts; Everett (George Clooney), Pete (John Turturro), and Delmar (Tim Blake Nelson). Mirroring the story of Odysseus in the Odyssey by Homer, these characters must face the most prolific of villains such as the Sirens and the cyclops. Slapstick performances from George Clooney and John Turturro bring to life the comedic aspect of a tragic story that involves betrayal, death, and fantasy. The masterful direction by the Coen Brother brought to life the challenges and difficulties that Odysseus had to go through to eventually be with his loved ones. Using humor and a charming cast, they were able to make the story their own and make a sort of parody of Homer's novel. Although there were times where I was confused with the direction that the story was taking, and how the dark humor did not always hit the mark, it is a fun adventure story that needs to be watched. Overall, the charming cast and direction from the Coen Brothers, make this a George Clooney staple and classic.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"

by Brooke Dupree
Directors:
Joel Coen, Ethan Coen (uncredited)
Writers:
Homer (epic poem ""The Odyssey""), Ethan Coen
Stars:
George Clooney, John Turturro, Tim Blake Nelson, John Goodman, Holly HunterAnyone who has read Homer's Odyssey knows that Odysseus's journey is wracked with obstacles. Odysseus's internal battle with his ego and his desire to go home to his family is the inspiration for the Coen Brothers successful portrayal of the journey of Ulysses Everett McGill (George Clooney), and his two fellow escaped convicts in ""O Brother Where Art Thou?"" (2000).Everett's obsession with his hair and his know-it-all tendencies lead he and his two dimwitted jail mates, Pete (John Torturro) and Delmar (Tim Blake Nelson) as they search for a secret treasure through the deep south during the Great Depression. Just like in The Odyssey, they come across their fair share of hurdles, the ultimate of which being the Lawman, hot on their trail, which leads the audience through their ridiculous pitfalls, narrowly escaping the law, accompanying bank robbers, and losing one of their friends to the Sirens.There are two ways one could view this film and be either disappointed or delighted. If the audience is expecting to follow a more modern story that closely relates to The Odyssey, she will be disappointed since the film is very loosely based on Homer's classic poem. However, if the expectation is to just find a story about three escaped convicts searching for treasure, then she will see some of the connections to The Odyssey, but appreciate the turn of events as its own story, somewhat from The Odyssey's characters and plot line. The obvious liberty that the Coen brothers took with depicting Homer's Odyssey does not veer completely off base; instead they offer the basic nuts and bolts of some of its most epic characters and scenes. Cyclops makes an appearance as a smooth-talking Bible salesman, played by John Goodman, and the Siren scene, is sexy and mesmerizing, as it should be. Since the Coen brothers left some of the most ultimate parts of the Odyssey in the film, we are able to make the connection, but view each scene as its own separate contribution to the journey of Everett himself.Some of the most important characters from Homer's poem are missing, however, one of them especially, the character of Telemachus. Although we don't necessarily need his character to tell the whole story, his absence is felt by the necessary plot moving specifically towards Odysseus's journey, which is, in part, to get home to his son and wife, and helps to portray the time lost in Odysseus's absence. Without his presence in the movie, the audience may lose this detrimental part to the story. We are also missing the overall stakes. Throughout the film, the connection between Everett and his ultimate goal is lost. This could be because the focus on the possibility of losing his wife and daughters to another man (the suitors) is not very well established as the most important motive for Everett's escape from prison. The way Southerners are portrayed is also a bit problematic, in my opinion. Some of the characters are seen as being redneck hicks, dumb, and foolish. Although this portrayal is mostly done as a backwards humor, I think it is a mis-portrayal, since, the Coen brothers have admitted (per other film critiques) that they have never even been to Mississippi. That being said, I find it a little jarring that the South is chosen as a background to represent the foolishness and stupidity of some of The Odyssey's most famous players. I am biased, however, as I have lived in the south my entire life.I think ""O Brother where Art Thou?"" was an attempt by the Coen brothers to remain true to the story of Odysseus's journey, but not stick to it as a form of storytelling. I believe it is successful as its own story, not as it relates to The Odyssey, but as it stands alone by itself. In other words, the characters and the scenes can be considered something completely different than The Odyssey, as more of a journey to ""get the girl"" and find religion, since from the beginning, Everett argues with his cohorts about religious validity. And speaking of religion, the film seems to be using religion, or Everett's question of it, as a way to question the difference between right and wrong and the basic human struggle to stay on the right path, resist temptation. As Everett continues his quest to get home, he begins to ""suffer"" and asks God for mercy.I would compare this movie to a ""road trip"" film such as ""Smokey and The Bandit,"" a rendition of which is complete with southern sass and culture, bluegrass and country singing, and travelers who are constantly evading the law, without a heavy influence on the ultimate objective of the journey itself. ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" may not be lacking in humor and good ole southern religion, but its attempt to stay true to the Original Odyssey is, in effect, not going to make it home.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
730,piscescharm,Weird Yet Enjoyable,8,8 May 2006,"""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" is odd yet you have an itch to finish it if you were to be interrupted halfway through the movie. It is based off the Oddysey, and at first you find that funny but if you think about it, many things relate to the book, which I never read yet only know about through referrals in another book.Some relations are the fact that George Clooney plays a man named Ulysses Everett McGill, and Ulysses is Roman for Oddyseus (however your spell that). Also, the sexy sirens ""bewitching"" Pete, which some supernatural woman did to most of the men in the Oddysey. The wife's name is Penny, which I think has some relationship to a woman named Penelope in the book. My friend mentioned some similarities (she has read the book) by being given some impossible tasks such as ""get the ring from a 9,000 ft. lake."" The sheriff with the hound is said to be like Poseidon, because he was chasing after ""Everett"" throughout the movie.This was an enjoyable movie, not on my top 25 list but most-likely on my top 100. George Clooney and Tim Blake Nelson stole the show to me, though other characters such as Tommy Johnson and the one-eyed Bible Salesman (I don't know his name) were a hoot, too.","O Brother, Where Art Thou"
