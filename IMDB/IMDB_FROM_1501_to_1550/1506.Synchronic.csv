0,SnoopyStyle,interesting premise,6,19 February 2021,"Steve Denube (Anthony Mackie) and Dennis Dannelly (Jamie Dornan) are best friends and paramedic partners. Dennis is married to Tara (Katie Aselton) and Brianna (Ally Ioannides) is their daughter. Steve is diagnosed with terminal cancer. The paramedics have been called to some strange deaths which involve a new synthetic drug named Synchronic. Steve goes to buy up the drug supply and discovers that it has usual temporal effects.This has an interesting premise. It should reveal itself in a more organic flow. The story telling is a bit too messy and I am a little uncertain about the rules of this world. Also, Brianna's story is a bit muddled. This needs more clarity and more time developing the characters. It needs some better writing beyond the interesting premise.",Synchronic
1,nogodnomasters,Allways,7,14 November 2020,"The story centers on Steve (Anthony Mackie) who is a paramedic in New Orleans. He is treating a lot of people who are victims of the new designer drug Synchronic. He buys up the drug to prevent people from taking it. Brianna (Ally Ioannides) is the daughter of his partner. She takes the drug and disappears. The creator of the drug, awkwardly hiding in Steve's closet, explains {PLOT SPOILER} that it allows you to travel in time for 7 minutes.The science wasn't great but the story held my interest.Guide: F-word.

2,kosmasp,In Sync,8,7 April 2020,"It doesn't happen often, but since I will be talking a little bit about the plot, I thought I'd put up a spoiler warning. I will not talk about the ending, I will not spoil anything that is not being told in general summaries. I still have different standards, when it comes to spoiling and that's why I'm ""warning"" people, before I go on.Movies that have time travel themes have quite some problems when it comes to logic. I do think this movie generally moves through them in a good way. You have to suspend disbelief obviously to actually get the most out of this quite crazy and original idea. And just to be clear, this movie does not promote taking drugs! Not the ones we know and especially not the ones no one has ever tried - or lived to tell about ...",Synchronic
3,paul_haakonsen,Quite linear and predictable...,5,12 January 2021,"I hadn't even heard about this 2019 movie titled ""Synchronic"" before now in 2021, as I had the chance to sit down and watch it. I read the synopsis for the movie and it sounded like it could be something worthwhile watching. So I gave the movie a chance.And yeah, ""Synchronic"" definitely was watchable, but it wasn't an impressive movie. The storyline was just way too generic and predictable. It felt like writer Justin Benson was opting for the easiest way for constructing a storyline for the movie. Everything was just so linear and running on auto-pilot. So I can't really claim to have been blown away by the storyline told in ""Synchronic"".Actually I would say that the movie's directors Justin Benson and Aaron Moorhead set up a whole lot of things that had potential, but ultimately they failed to bring them to fruition, and it just felt half-hearted. There definitely was potential to be found in the movie, but it was just wasted as nothing felt thoroughly explored, explained or exposed.The acting in the movie was good, but the actors and actresses just didn't have an overwhelming amount of material to work with, so it felt like it was semi-hindered performances.My rating of ""Synchronic"" lands on a very bland and mediocre five out of ten stars. The movie is good enough for a single viewing, if you enjoy linear sci-fi movies. But the contents of the storyline just were far too feeble to support more than a single viewing. ""Synchronic"" came and went without leaving much of any ripples in the fabric of time and space.",Synchronic
4,zardoz-13,Time Passages . . .,8,16 March 2021,"An intriguing but low-budget sci-fi time-travel tale that accents character over computer-generated imagery, ""Synchronic"" seizes your attention from the get-go with a startling scene about the titular hallucinogen. According to one hard-boiled cop, ""Synchronic"" concerns a synthetic, Spice-like designer drug that makes ""junky monkeys go nuts."" In the opening scene, a couple in a motel room gobble white pills emblazoned with the letter S. Not long afterward, they have unforgettable experiences. When he exits the elevator with a bucket of ice, the guy finds himself stuck in a vast Sahara-like desert. Meantime, the gal imagines a dense jungle has taken over their room and an exotic snake is slithering toward her with evil intent. Eventually, two New Orleans paramedics, Steve (Anthony Mackie of ""Ant-Man"") and Dennis (Jamie Dornan of ""Fifty Shades of Grey""), who've seen just about everything, find the guy dead and dismembered at the bottom of the elevator shaft. The distraught dame hasn't left their bed. She has two gaping snake-bite puncture wounds in her swollen right knee. She had watched in stupefied paralysis as the jungle encroached on their motel room. Foliage covered the walls. A primitive man also materialized out of nowhere. Similarly, he was stunned by her presence, too.Co-directors Justin Benson and Aaron Moorhead of ""The Endless"" orchestrate similar episodes, skinny dipping through history with vignettes portraying Ice Age hunters, 17th century pirates, 19th century slavery, and the 20th century KKK, as Steve and Dennis find themselves in the thick of a synchronic epidemic. The greatest shortcoming of ""Synchronic"" perhaps is its barebones budget. The sight of a soldier atomized when he treads on a live artillery shell during the Battle of New Orleans is tastefully spectacular. Although a mite too talkative for its own good, ""Synchronic"" takes itself seriously, boasts a credible cast, agile cinematography, and an atmospheric orchestral music score. Sadly, it strains credibility with its interesting spin on H.G. Wells' ""The Time Machine."" This provocative but complex R-rated movie approaches time-travel from a non-linear perspective. As their inspiration, Benson and Moorhead drew on American theoretical physicist Brian Greene and his book ""The Fabric of the Cosmos"" (2003) about the past, the present, and the future all occurring at once.Our African American protagonist Steve has been silently suffering with a terrible secret. He hasn't been feeling well, and his doctor (Sam Malone of ""American Ultra"") reveals that he has a terminal cancer on his pineal gland in his brain. He warns Steve that he might live less than six months. He urges Steve also to start radiation treatment. Instead, Steve consoles himself with Jack Daniels when he isn't on duty. His life-long best friend and paramedic partner Dennis is suffering, too. Recently, Dennis and his wife Tara (Katie Aselton of ""Silk Road"") let their eighteen-year-old daughter, Brianna (Ally Ioannides of ""Brand New Old Love""), move into a New Orleans university dorm. One evening, Steve and Dennis respond to an emergency at a frat house. A white male has OD'ed on cocaine and an Asian female is just as oblivious. Steve learns Brianna had been there earlier but has since slipped off to parts unknown. They find a crumpled Synchronic packet on her chair. Dennis prints out missing persons fliers with Brianna's photo. Alarmed and outraged, Steve storms off to buy all the Synchronic left in the Crescent City. Dennis and he have seen enough of the reckless havoc the designer drug has wrought on the Big Easy. Little does Steve know the chemist who created the drug is feverishly buying back the last few packets, too. Eventually, Dr. Kermani (Ramiz Monsef of ""Where's George?"") crosses paths with Steve, and Kermani offers Steve triple what he paid for Synchronic.Most sci-fi movies reach that moment when pandemonium rules, and nobody knows what to do. In the nick of time, a scientist saves the day. Conveniently, Dr. Kermani breaks into Steve's house after our hero left him standing empty-handed outside a tobacco shop. Cornering him in a closet, Steve brandishes a baseball bat. Desperately, Kermani begs Steve to sell the Synchronic back to him. Steve lies and says he flushed it. The chemist explains he had been designing ""new drugs very similar to illegal drugs."" He altered the molecules sufficiently to assure FDA approval so it could be sold for public consumption. Unfortunately, the FDA started cracking down on the variants, and Kermani found himself in trouble. During their exchange, Steve reveals he is dying from a cancerous pineal tumor. A surprised Kermani explains this affliction enhances Steve's ability to time-trip with Synchronic. However, Steve runs the risk of getting lost in time. Kermani's words echo Greene's book. The chemist explains time isn't linear, meaning one event that follows another and then another. Time occurs all at once, with past, present, and future co-existing like the grooves in a vinyl record. Synchronic serves as the needle that allows the user to cruise those grooves.After he ousts Kermani, Steve conducts some Synchronic experiments and discovers time travel is possible. During his first foray, his house vanishes under him, and he finds himself stranded in a swamp. Moreover, an alligator and a sword-wielding Spanish conquistador have spotted him. Suddenly, Steve finds himself back safely in his house! Afterward, he records videos of his departures. He learns he can go to different places in time from various spots in his house. Meantime, Dennis is angry when Steve reveals not only his brain tumor diagnosis, but also his decision to search for Brianna. Steve explains she is lost in time and unable to return without his help. As Brianna's bewildered father, Dennis feels responsible for her rescue, but Steve explains his pineal tumor enhances his ability to time travel using the drug. Reluctantly, Dennis watches Steve vanish into thin air. The camaraderie between Steve and Dennis is brotherly and adds a bittersweet poignance to Steve's willingness to save Brianna. Ultimately, ""Synchronic"" qualifies as heartfelt but heavyweight hokum.",Synchronic
5,evanston_dad,Terribly Executed,4,25 August 2021,"A slam bang premise is destroyed by terrible execution in this dreary sci-fi sludge.The most awkward set up ever finds Anthony Mackie, whose character is dying of cancer, dabbling with a drug that allows users to zip to other points in time. He wants to find the daughter of his partner and best friend, played by Jamie Dornan, who looks like he wants to be anywhere but in this movie. She took the drug, went back in time, but got stuck there, because that can happen. The exposition and drama is doled out in haphazard chunks, the film flirts with racial themes about the difference between how white people and black people view the past, nothing coheres with anything else, and to top it all off the film looks terrible, like the whole thing was smothered in colorless gravy.Mackie tries mightily to do something, anything, with this movie, but he's let down by virtually every single other aspect of the film. Dornan comes as close to being embalmed that a human being can be without being actually embalmed. There are a couple of moments (that scene with the wooly mammoth!) that tease us with the promise of what could have been, which are mostly just cruel because of what we're actually given.Grade: D.",Synchronic
6,ferguson-6,an all too brief history of time,6,22 October 2020,"Greetings again from the darkness. Innovative filmmakers Justin Benson and Aaron Moorhead are frequent collaborators, as evidenced by such films as SPRING (2014) and THE ENDLESS (2017). Their films teeter between science-fiction, horror, fantasy, and personal drama, and this latest easily slides into the mind-bending and time-warping space they excel in ... and all without the mega-budget we've come to expect from such films (I'm looking at you INCEPTION).The film opens on a couple sharing a motel room and what appears to be an acid trip. Strange hallucinations hit them both. We soon flip to an emergency call performed by best buddy New Orleans paramedics Steve (Anthony Mackie) and Dennis (Jamie Dornan). Their overdose victim is located in a setting where something is just a bit off, and ""Time is a lie"" is written on the wall. When Steve and Dennis are called to the motel of the first scene, we all start to understand something bizarre is happening.Dennis is married to his wife Tara (Katie Aselton), who has recently given birth, and their headstrong 18 year-old daughter Brianna (Ally Ioannides) lives with them. Steve's days consist of one-night stands, more booze than any person should ingest, and time with his loyal dog Hawking (an obvious reference to the elements of time at play here). Dennis is bored and Steve is a mess, and things get worse when Steve is diagnosed with a brain tumor by his pineal gland, and Dennis's daughter Brianna disappears.A clue to the increasingly bizarre overdose and death scenes that Steve and Dennis run into is the ""Synchronic"" packaging. It's a synthetic/designer drug that has dramatic and lethal effects, and a packet was found where Brianna was last seen. Steve decides to test the drug in an effort to ""bring back"" his friend's daughter. As Steve videos his 7 minute trips to the past, and then kindly spells out everything he discovers, we viewers are spoon fed the details that would typically require some effort. Beyond the reference to Stephen Hawking, we also get plugs for French composer Claude Debussy and a rare James Bond- Charlie Sheen joke.Time travel has long been a fun topic for movies, and the ideas behind this one are quite promising. The only downsides are that it too obviously guides us through what's happening, and the trips back in time aren't as structured or interesting as we would hope ... although the idea of having the past be in the identical spot as the future is terrific. Benson and Moorhead are ambitious and creative filmmakers, and their shot at appealing to mainstream audiences is appreciated, as is the atmosphere and camera work. However, many of us would rather a bit more be left to our imagination.",Synchronic
7,deloudelouvain,Okay story but could have been better.,6,13 March 2021,"The plot was interesting to watch, a refreshing new story, but it could have been better exploited. The idea was there but they could have done more with it in my opinion. At least Synchronic isn't boring to watch, that's already something positive. There is enough going on to keep your attention for the entire movie. As for the acting it wasn't bad even though I saw the main characters do better in other movies. The Sci-fi was what made this movie okay to watch once.",Synchronic
8,FeastMode,subpar ripoff,4,8 March 2021,"This movie started out very intriguing. but you start to feel the straight-to-dvd level quality. and when you find out what the movie is about, you realize it's a straight ripoff of an amazing scifi movie and a really good netflix tv series. i don't want to say which ones because it would be a spoiler if you haven't seen them. but if you've seen them you know exactly what i'm talking about (the movie title is 7 letters and the series title is 4 letters, both have 3rd letter R).overall the movie is not terrible, but it's not cinema quality. and some of the dialogue felt awkward. some of the scifi elements were pretty cool. but as the movie went along, i kept caring less. and there are some serious flaws in the movie logic (1 viewing, 3/7/2021)",Synchronic
9,Cineanalyst,Of Fleeting Interest,4,17 April 2021,"""Synchronic"" is surely only worth watching if you're very much into time-travel movies, which I like to think I am, but even this one was lackluster to me. Plus, it's got Anthony Mackie. Seems like this guy is everywhere on my streaming channels lately. He was just in that other movie that appeared on Netflix lately but I decided to pass on, ""Outside the Wire"" (2021), and I delayed viewing the latest episode of ""The Falcon and the Winter Soldier"" on Disney+ for this one. Not that it's Mackie's fault. He seems like a chill guy--kind of an everyman quality to him, yet gorgeous and fit, but I digress. The movie's promotion seems to indicate that another guy is a co-lead here, but his character really doesn't matter. The pacing is pretty bad--wasting a lot of time on paramedic, family and medical stuff that hardly matters even in setting up the time-travel business--and overly-dramatic scoring does much of the heavy lifting early on to try to retain one's interest.Even when it does finally get to the time travel, it's pretty dull. Right off the bat, the drug that allows these seven-minutes sojourns to the past was designed by a drug maker who claims to have not known what it'd do, but he named it ""synchronic?"" Uh huh, I'm sure Merck said the same thing about ""ecstasy."" Furthermore, the scenario and Mackie's character go to great lengths to define the parameters of the drug's time travel capabilities or rules, but I wonder why he never thought he might have more success with the time traveling if he didn't keep doing it while drunk. Maybe he would've had the clarity of mind to buy a guinea pig instead of using his beloved dog for his experiment, then, or maybe carry some sort of weapon or protection if he keeps running into deadly situations every trip. None of that, including the obligatory ""Back to the Future"" reference, would much matter, though, if the time travel resulted in more than an illustration that history is racist.",Synchronic
10,A_Different_Drummer,fun watch,7,18 January 2021,"Almost falls into the trap of being a ""clever premise"" (known in Hollywood as High Concept) where the opening is more interesting than the rest of the movie. Good production values and the ever-reliable Anthony Mackie save the movie just in time, and make the whole thing a fun watch. Even with supersized giant plot hole at the very end.",Synchronic
11,851222,Interesting and descent movie,7,25 August 2021,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Synchronic"" (2019) is a movie with interesting premise. I won't go into details or spoilers, just will say that its an pretty unique take on time and friendship. At the core i think this movie was simply about friendship of two paramedics, and what they will do for each other. Also this movie's tone and cinematography were pretty interesting as they gave this movie a bit of a unique feeling and look.Overall, those who are looking for a descent but at the same time different science fiction movie could check this one out - its a pretty good one and crafted in a way you won't see very often.",Synchronic
12,westsideschl,Dumb!!,4,26 July 2021,"Take a semi legal pill and you travel back in time. OK, I know time travel is a pop script/literary target, but this is getting grade school dumb. Too many unanswered questions which isn't surprising given the lack of plausibility. Still not clear how far back is dependent on location or something like that. Lots of poor flow & holes to the storyline, but lots of scenes of two medics pushing a stretcher/gurney about.",Synchronic
13,The-Sarkologist,"Has Potential, but gets bogged down",5,14 February 2021,"Honestly, there doesn't seem to be much in the way of good movies that are in the cinemas at the moment. Then again, I guess living in the world of the Rona sort of does that to things. However, this one seemed to be interesting, and I managed to get into the cinema to watch it before we returned to another lockdown (and hopefully this one will only last a few days).Anyway, this film is about a couple of paramedics who encounter this new drug. The thing is that the victims seem to have died in some rather unusual ways, such as a pirate sword in the chest, or falling down an elevator shaft. It seems rather odd, until the movie progresses and we actually start to find out what it going on. Personally, I don't want to reveal what is actually going on behind the scenes, because that will give away one of the major things with the film.So, the daughter of one of the paramedics goes missing, and they suspect that it might actually have something to do with the drug. The other paramedic discovers that he is suffering from a brain tumor, and decides, what the heck, and ends up taking the plunge, which leads him to begin to experiment with what is actually going on.One of the interesting things about this film is how they play around with time. Like, the film doesn't actually flow from beginning to end, or at least it doesn't do this at the start. One begins to notice that the scenes with the two buddies seem to shift back and forth to various points in their relationship, though this is no doubt used to build up to the ending phase of the film. It's interesting, but in reality is really isn't anything new, though it does set the stage for the finale.Look, don't expect anything too intense. This is actually a pretty slow film, though one probably should remember that it is a low budget film, and they do do a reasonable job with it. However, it sort of comes across as one of those films that you would expect to go straight to Netflix, as opposed to going straight to the cinema. Yet, with the limited number of films available, and all of the blockbusters constantly being pushed back, I guess this is why we are getting a lot of these straight to streaming services.",Synchronic
14,cruise01,Time bending concept but feels like the movie does not reach its potential.,7,19 January 2021,3.5 out of 5 starsSynchronic is a pretty fair science fiction horror film. Done by the same writer and director that did The Endless. Which is still a better movie and more trippy. Compared to Synchronic.The plot is good. About two emts Dennis (Jamie Dornan) and Steve (Anthony Mackie) who are finding a lot of people who have overdosed or died from a new drug called Synchronic. Many of the deaths have been odd. When Steve decides to take the drug to find a missing teen girl. He realizes the drug takes the person into a different time period. Depending on location on where they stand.Plot may not be as mind bending or reaching its potential with what they can do or take the story with that concept idea. It does get a little boring with Steve and Dennis sharing there dramatic scenes about what they are missing in life. Which does slow the pacing down with the direction.The visual effects are great. Steve travelling through an ice age period. Or during the slavery time period is thrilling.Jamie Dornan and Anthony Mackie performances were both decent with there roles. Jamie Dornans character feels a little useless and had less to do with the story.Its a pretty entertaining sci fi horror film that may keep you watching.,Synchronic
15,eddie_baggins,An almost film with a lot of unexplored ideas,6,1 February 2021,"If I were to hedge my bets on directing duo Justin Benson and Aaron Moorhead on one day delivering an outright cinematic classic, I would be feeling fairly confident of my chances on coming out on top with that particular wager.Coming close to creating a genuine horror/sci fi romance masterpiece with the underseen Spring and getting people talking with the likes of The Endless and Resolution, Moorhead and Benson (who have recently signed on to deliver the Moon Knight TV series for Marvel) have shown a particular knack for crafting low budget affairs with high reaching concepts with their newest addition Synchronic falling very much into that category.As is expected from a Moorhead and Benson feature, Synchronic features mind-melting ideas, snazzy visuals and a moody score and this time has the bonus of well-liked actors Anthony Mackie and Jamie ""I wasn't in 50 Shades of Grey I swear"" Dornan as the Hollywood duo play New Orleans paramedics and friends Steve and Dennis, a duo caught up in a bizarre new synthetic drug craze that is seemingly bending the concepts of time and causing disastrous occurrences throughout the city.Feeling as though it shares similar DNA to the creating teams Endless and Resolution products and also a smidgen of Spring's visceral horror elements, Synchronic is a rather slowly paced affair for the concept it delves into and will likely cause some genre fans to be searching for their phones as the methodically paced journey of Mackie's Steve, whose direct dealings with the designer drug causing him to go on a life altering journey to past events that can prove deadly if luck is to fall that way, takes hold.There's a lot happening in the films 100 or so minutes of runtime and perhaps the films greatest failure is its inability to explore each of its various themes or facets with much care or consideration, as a viewer you can't help but ponder what may've been had the film managed to streamline its components in a more cohesive whole or perhaps been born into a mini-series with far more time to investigate its many intriguing elements.As the film stands as an end product, its one that wavers between top-class independent filmmaking and frustratingly vague/unrefined collections of ideas and scenarios but there's enough positives to be taken away from this affair that the bet in solid odds that Benson and Moorhead could just well be the next big thing in unique and original Hollywood movie making.Final Say -A film with a lot going on and one that doesn't always appear to know what to do with what it has started, Synchronic is an interesting yet not always totally engaging sci-fi experience that should be watched and enjoyed with expectations well in check.3 dog leads out of 5",Synchronic

17,jtindahouse,A pretty forgettable experience,5,14 January 2021,"I had been looking forward to 'Synchronic' for a very long time. Ever since I first heard about it at the 2019 Fantastic Fest it sounded right up my alley. Perhaps the anticipation levels were too high though, because the end result was a bit of a let down to be honest. It's not a horrible movie, it just wastes a fun concept. The possibilities with this idea are endless, and yet they chose to go in the most mundane and safe route they possibly could.I won't spoil anything, but one of the lead characters finds out some news that basically makes him not care about whether he lives or dies any more. How is this helpful to what the film is trying to achieve? If a character doesn't care if they live or die in a situation then why should I care about them? This worked in some other ways in the film, but overall it felt like a bad choice to me.The acting is good from Anthony Mackie and Jamie Dornan, there's some mildly interesting concepts that come up along the way that usually present themselves in time-travel movies and the pacing was good enough to not make the movie feel like it dragged too much. Other than that though the positives were pretty few and far between. I really wanted to like this movie, but sadly it wasn't for me.",Synchronic
18,stevendbeard,Drama With Sci-Fi Elements,7,25 October 2020,"I saw ""Synchronic"", starring Jamie Dornan-the Fifty Shades movies, The Fall_tv; Anthony Mackie-Point Blank_2019, the Falcon in the Marvel movies & tv show; Katie Aselton-Legion_tv, Our Idiot Brother and Ally Ioannides-Into the Badlands_tv, Parenthood_tv.
This is a hard movie to classify. It is basically a drama with sci_fi elements. Jamie & Anthony are paramedics working in New Orleans when they start coming across some mysterious deaths. One person is found stabbed with a sword, one is found completely burned and another is found at the bottom of an elevator shaft with his broken and scattered body parts all around him. Jamie & Anthony soon discover that all the victims had taken a new psychedelic designer drug called Synchronic-maybe there's a connection to the deaths? Katie plays Jamie's wife and Ally is his daughter. Ally turns up missing and guess what she took right before she disappeared? Anthony discovers clues that he thinks will lead him to her, but doesn't think anyone would believe him so he records what he is doing, in case it doesn't work, at least someone will know what he attempted to do. The explanation of the drugs effects is where the sci_fi elements come in and it's best if you don't know too much about it until you see the movie. The only problem I had was the ending. It left a big question.
It's rated ""R"" for drug content, language, violence and bloody images and has a running time of 1 hour & 36 minutes.
I would probably buy it on DVD.",Synchronic

The scene was so ludicrous I had to stop. What a stupid film.The acting ranged from average to subpar. I felt nothing for the characters or character relationships.

20,henry8-3,Synchronic,4,16 August 2021,Mackie and Dornan play paramedics who are finding people affected of indeed killed by a new narcotic - Synchronic. Dornan's daughter disappears and Mackie for personal reasons investigates the drug and the connection to the disappearance and discovers that there is a time shift element to it.Interesting idea of a drug causing shifts through time and the 2 leads work well off each other and dramatically it's not a bad effort. However it is constrained by a low budget which makes the time shift elements rather underwhelming.,Synchronic

24,masonfisk,A TIME TRAVELING DRUG...DON'T SIGN ME UP...!,6,22 April 2021,"A 2019 gritty sci fi fable starring Anthony Mackie & Jamie Dornan (from the 50 Shades films). Mackie & Dornan play a couple of EMT's who keep running into victims (murdered in strange ways) who were taking an over the counter designer drug named Synchronic. Meanwhile in their respective homefronts, Dornan is happily married w/his wife expecting while their college aged daughter is about to leave for school when one day she turns up missing. Mackie has just gotten the gut punch news he's dying from a tumor in his brain & since all he has is the job, his dog & no tangible relationships, he accepts his fate but when the doctor remarks his pineal gland (where the tumor resides) hasn't hardened, like it does for most adults, it triggers a clue because these recent deaths he's been encountering are all young & the drug stimulates that particular gland. Tracking down the one shop where the drug is being sold, Mackie buys the lot & decides to take a taste (what the hell!). It turns out when you take the drug, it causes the user to actually travel back in time (the ice age, the 1920's, the 1860's during the Civil War) & returning to the present (when the drug is taken again). Mackie figures this is probably what happened to Dornan's girl so he begins experimenting hopefully to pinpoint where (& when) she may be trapped at which starts to look hopeless when his supply starts to dwindle. Not knowing the directors (the Red Letter Media guys clued me into their past more focused, smaller works) but given the heavy hitters in front of the camera & I presume the size of the budget may've have stifled some of the logic of this endeavor which provides a great ride but doesn't make much sense at the end.",Synchronic

People seemed to get hurt in weird ways after they took the pill named synchronic. The couple one of whom was bitten by a snake and the other was found chopped up to pieces in the elevator and it was brutal. Then at the campus a student went missing after taking that pill and it was Brianna. Steve wanted to buy it out from a store and came across with the chemist who produced that very pill and he was too trying to buy it out. He broke into steves house and explained him linear time being a stubborn perception. He then tried the pills home and went to a swamp and almost got shot by a European colonialist and then to a group of old white man with his dog. He almost got shot and his dog got stuck. He was diagnosed with terminal cancer and was being treated with radiation. There were flashbacks of his parents' and sister's coffins drifted in the waters of flood and they went to the cemetery and Steve showed the footages to Dennis. They went to the boulder by the river carved ""allways"" on it. Steve took the pill and found himself in the middle of the civil war. He found Brianna hiding in a trench among dead people. They got back to the boulder and a confederacy soldier called him slave and wanted him to kneel down. She got back and he got stuck while the soldier stepped on a mine. Steve and Dennis shook hands while he totally disappeared from the present time. New Orleans and showing the Milky Way intermittently felt even more mystical.

I was really loving the surrealism as these two paramedics where encountering the junkies overdosing and the two trying to piece together what the heck was going on. I felt like great! The director made the film so we are discovering these strange and bizarre scenes as though we were one of the paramedics. I was hoping for a twisty psychological thriller and it felt like one.Then the reveal comes in about 50 minutes in. It felt like being drenched by the ice bucket challenge. Noo Noo, are you serious? Time travel by pill? Did they do a Alice in Wonderland on us? Nooooo, the beginning of the film was so good. Why? I was hoping something like the mind bending Inception story with the surrealism of The Cell. But I got a Disney film?I am going to give this film a 6 only because I really loved the beginning, but I hated the rest of the plot.

Dialogue pop-ups from nowhere and goes nowhere. The editing was confusing since they give some scenes out of order and never establish what comes before or after.Now the good stuff, cause there are definitely good things in this film. While the general idea is a tough pill to swallow, if you love sci-fi you can deal with it. The acting was mostly fine, even though Mackie felt wooden at times (also would randomly start monologuing), while Dornan was looking confused on why would his character say these random Tumblr quotes. The dark ambient score was quite lovely. Overall, they did well for the low budget they probably had.I did enjoy the general idea and some of the unfocused stuff the characters randomly throw into their everyday dialogue. Many people have lived and died, and nothing will be left of us. Time will beat us all, and one should try hard and enjoy the moment. Also, the ending (while being a little cheesy) still felt good and worked on multiple levels (which I'm sure was intentional).If you enjoyed the previous works of the duo, you might want to check it out. If you didn't, or you're just looking for interesting sci-fi, this might disappoint you (or you might not even sit through it due to super slow pacing).",Synchronic

The story was basically about the pineal gland.This movie was directed by Justin Benson and Aaron Moorhead, whose previous work included the Endless, which was a pretty weird movie. This one was not as weird, but it was slow burn just like The Endless. The background music elevated the atmosphere and emphasized the mystery.I liked how Anthony Mackie learned about the mystery of synchronic, which was the main sci-fi aspect. However, as much as I liked the sci-fi aspect, I didn't like and care about the characters and their issues. This was philosophical, and I just don't care much about it. I wished that they focused more on the sci-fi element.Overall, a good looking sci-fi but I just don't care about the philosophical discussion behind it. 6.5/10.",Synchronic

Major plot hole,3,10 February 2021,"The movie is much better if it end before that last scene, where we see Anthony looks at the rock and then we see the present time rock with the writing. some great shots, and then the ending ruined it all. so how far was the party/park/rock from her friends place? Think we needed to establish that as its confirmed she took the pill while still at her friends place, seems a far distance to wander to get to that park before it kicks in. Also how long was she in this trench/battle? We're assuming at least 2 weeks if not months go by normal time and we don't get clarification on the dog experiment on whether he was still gone only 7 min or was it longer considering he ended up stuck there for the day. just to save the worst part of the film (the daughter and her horrible acting) why would she even go back in time before him when she took her pill like 5-10 min later? Shouldn't he have jumped back first then the tension would be how does she hold out long enough to get back? i would of enjoyed if director could of involved the other main actor in saving his daughter, forcing them to travel through time more, gathering information and clues, The ending would be more agreeable if we had seen more of that characters journey or exceptance of the events. It felt pretty rushed by just showing him the tape. The ending loses it. There wasn't enough done to build his connection with the daughter or even his friends family life for him to suddenly risk being stuck or to make them the focus point. Anyway i noticed little things in this film The flashing light in the ambulance window is the same non stop, his house main door is like a room door that the chemist goes out from, the ice age guys costume was horrible. Even the fire looked super fake when he met with the ice age guy. Don't waste your time on this bad movie.",Synchronic

It delves into time travelling & asking the existential question about life, death & everything in between.Without going into too much details, the protagonists are two paramedics that are long term friends but bought up from different backgrounds. They come across & deal with victims of people taking a new designer drug..This seems grippy but when one of the protagonist's daughter goes missing after taking said drug then the story focuses on the search. One of the protagonist discovers that he has cancer (that makes him ask the existential questions) & decides to do his own investigation into this drug in order to uncover what happened to the missing girl.This is psychodelic trip of movie that makes the viewer uneasy as it makes you question one's existential question whilst walking in someone else's shoes.

Although the duology of ""Resolution"" and ""The Endless"" remain my personal favorites, ""Synchronic"" is another proof these guys know and love what they're doing. A bizarre and surreal drug story that grows into a buddy sci-fi dramedy, pondering existential questions along the way. It is the ""Tenet"" I wanted. Spoilers ahead.Two New Orleans paramedics and best friends, Steve (Anthony Mackie) and Dennis (Jamie Dornan), encounter a series of bizarre deaths, later found out to be linked to a new designer drug called Synchronic, and it provides some amazing, otherworldly effects...Not for better or worse, but I can hardly call ""Synchronic"" a horror film, for it's a sci-fi drama with a healthy dose of comedy, though the first half of the movie is the most horror-like, before it is known where the mystery is going. Film starts out with a beautiful, dreamy, teasing sequence, before grounding itself into the grim world of hurting nights in the hands of the paramedics. Come to think about it, there are very few movies with paramedics as main characters, set in the harsh world they live in. ""Synchronic"" shows a slice of that.""Synchronic"" floats on a relatively simple plot, Steve is the one who sniffs trouble and starts investigating, propelled by his emotional and physical state and the recent news of a brain tumor. Dennis's daughter falls victim to Synchronic and disappears, and Steve will be the one to save her. But additional substance sauce is in the melodrama and its explored themes, mortality, existence, what it is to live and be alive. Anthony Mackie and Jamie Dornan together make a good pair, and it was often their conversations I found myself pondering the most. Besides all this, there's time travel, something that's possible via Synchronic. Steve's on a mission, and this mission has everything, dangers, amusements and lessons. Through the concept of time travel we learn a brief history of the world, perhaps all too brief - the potential of this concept could be of epic proportions, and it sort of feels like ""Synchronic"" is a sample of that potential, but a potent one. And it's admirable, taking into account that this is no big-budget production.I have no clue what is the budget, but despite all, ""Synchronic"" is visually impressive and never feels cheap. As far as technical and aesthetical qualities go, Moorhead and Benson's entire filmography consists of well composed movies, special FX are always used to great effectivity, and never overused, and the original score... Jimmy LaValle, composer of ""The Endless"" and ""Spring"", returns. ""Synchronic's"" score almost psychedelic, and the one element that's truly horror. Love musical scores like this one.
I can see how, perhaps, this movie feels less complicated and more straight-forward than the Benson and Moorhead we're used to, but I don't think that mystery is the point of ""Synchronic"". If You enjoy the work of these directors, time-travel plots, buddy films, or beautiful unorthodox thrillers, be sure to catch it! My rating: 7/10",Synchronic

Director: Justin Benson and Aaron Moorhead

Overall rating 57/100Synchronic is about Two New Orleans paramedics, who's lives are ripped apart after they encounter a series of horrific deaths linked to a designer drug with bizarre, otherworldly effects.This was a perfect example of a really interesting idea that was executed in a mediocre way and ultimately fall flat. The idea was very creative, I liked the set up. The cinematography was very creative and unique, this was a surprisingly strong element considering its low budget. The humour was good, the chemistry between Jamie Dornan and Anthony Mackie was strong. With solid performances from the both of them. They set up both of there personalities well too. I liked the sense of mystery the film had, with effective uses of gore. And good character depth linking to the main plot points with the drug. There was some good explanation and interesting moments to do with the synchronic drug and the idea of time. They executed a good tense tone, the development to the plot was fun, and the editing was strong, establishing the trippy tone well.However, there was so many lapses in the logic that felt unprofessional, a couple of insensitive scenes to do with racism that didn't sit well with me. A lot of the supporting cast was unlikeable with some questionable dialogue. There was a lack of emotional stakes due to the rushed relationships and lack of character depth. It took way to long to progress the plot, it got too repetitive and made the structure of the film an absolute mess me. There was some forced conflict, some lazy writing and set up. With way too much reliance on exposition and developing the plot through dialogue. And the ending was underwhelming.So overall, Synchronic was a really interesting concept. With some really clever aspects and creative cinematography. Also with undeniable chemistry between the leads. But ultimately falls flat from its promising premise. With a messily plotted out, often cheap and unprofessional feel to it, and a complete disconnect to the characters which made it difficult to connect with the film as a whole.",Synchronic
46,ritera1,Heavily metaphysical.,7,28 August 2021,"Not without merit and interesting elements but didn't satisfy. Felt very much like the writer/directors had too much creative freedom and the vision didn't come out in the final product.Some good character development but kind of irrelevant to the story. Uneven.Anthony Mackie, who is usually good, had relatively little to work with. Many of his scenes just ended up with some snarky comment. Director chose for him to have a booze bottle in his hand during much of the video sequences. Disappointing. Would think such things would sober you up quick.James Dornan (50 Shades of Grey) actually had more well-written segments that he did fairly well. A couple scenes near the end that would good acting class exercises.Also uneven in their made-up ""science.""Several very convenient coincidences with Mackie in regards to the story. The cancer scare amounted to essentially nothing except to establish the condition of his brain. That was important in establishing that time travel was biological, which struck me as silly.Was kind of high on the lower budget chart. Looks like the directors/writer have had carte blanche with some other features in the past, too. I've noticed this small circle of young filmmakers that can turn out regular stuff in the horror genre that seem to be given wide birth. They seem to intersect in the VHS line of movies.

47,leesimon-26357,Slow Film Noir with a good cast,6,22 February 2021,"This is a weird, slow-burn kind of film. Film Noir would be the best way to describe it. It is brooding, dark, never funny, without a single moment of levity. The action, when it briefly happens isn't thrilling like in an action movie. It comes across like an exciting thought experiment.
This film overall has a very original plot, but if the film was limited to this run-time, then I think they should have spent less time on setting up everything before the actual supernatural events are witnessed.
Overall good, and I want to see it again. I'm sure the second viewing will determine whether this is a film I see again and again, or if I figure that I've gotten enough out of the experience and never see it again. The score could only go up if I saw it again. It couldn't go below 6/10 for me, no matter what I discover with additional viewings.
I didn't like the soundtrack and the music did not add to the enjoyment of the film, in my opinion.

48,youngcollind,"As much as they're often imperfect, you can at least rely on the Benson/Moorhead duo to deliver something interesting",6,2 July 2021,"This film starts with promise, exploring drug culture through both the high and aftermath, focusing on the paramedics in charge of cleaning up the mess. Then it drops two big dramatic elements, a terminal diagnosis and a missing kid, which feels a little heavy handed, but I guess it's necessary for the plot. Then the big idea at the films core is revealed: a drug that lets you time travel. This is a pretty silly concept, and was already explored in the intentionally absurd ""Time Traveling Bong"", so you have to strap on your willing suspension of disbelief and go with it. Even with that fully in check, many of the parameters of the drug and decisions of the characters come off as unrealistic. The film does stay engaging though, and takes the time to explore some interesting musings on our limited mortality. You'd expect a film about drugs that mess with the fabric of reality to drift further into the abstract, but for the most part the film falls into familiar time travel tropes, and ends on particularly cliche sentimentality. All and all, not unwatchable, there are just many things you'll need to get past.",Synchronic
49,dschmeding,An OK movie with a lot of wasted potential,6,12 January 2020,"I loved the first two movies by Benson and Moorhead. ""Resolution"" was a perfect example of how to take a miniscule budget and tell a captivating story with loads of mystery and twists and turns. ""The endless"" went into a similar direction, even incorporating parts of ""Resolution"" and mixing up genres from Thriller, Horror to Sci-Fi including a very dry humor.""Synchronic"" is a different movie but again heavily focussing on the obscure dimensional themes from the other movies. Time has always been a focus of the movies and while there was portals and strange cults before, now there is a synthetic DMT-like drug that is making the user travel through time. The main characters are two paramedics who encounter the collateral damage of the drug and get entangled with finding out what is happening with so many dead, injured or disappeared users.The acting and cinematography is great but everything feels distant... the characters are not talking very much, show very little emotion and it feels like a cold kind of buddy movie as their relationships are unraveled... well kind of at least. While one is troubled by his disappeared teenage daughter and his relationship to his wife falling apart the other one gets diagnosed with a terminal brain tumor which leads him to investigate further into the Synchronic phenomena as he has nothing to lose now and guessing that his buddies daughters disappearance may be connected to the drug.Now ... that is it. The drug itself opens many possibilities with time shifting, people slowly entering other times, bringing back strange items or wounds from ancient weapons. It is all beautifully done when its done... but the storytelling felt lazy to me. The introduction of the chemist who syntheticised the drug for example is one perfect example of this .. and there are many. So there are many things in how the paperthing story unfolds that feel very ""Hollywood"" while the real interesting aspect of how and why the drug works are ignored. Its all very superficial and in case the movie was supposed to be about the characters relationships... honestly I did not care. Everything was acted and told in such a distant way... it just passed right by me and made me wonder if the movie really was over when the screen went black.So many possibilities and illogical decisions like a paramedic just dropping full doses of an unknown drug he is even short on to complete his ""research"" on it. The chemist feels like a cheap storytelling device incorporated with a crowbar just to drop him off on the sidelines immediatly. And basically the whole movie was like that. Its about two people, everything else being randomly dropped into their life and disappering... and then its hard to even care for these guys. At the end I felt like I was emotionally cheated or something. Which is disappointing as the basic premise and quality of the movie had so much potential. Its not that ""Synchronic"" is a boring movie but honestly there is not so much happening for all the mystery at its core.",Synchronic

53,TuesdayThe17th,Epic and endlessly mind boggling,9,28 January 2021,"I have been itching to see this movie since 2019 when I heard of its development. I love this directing duo and their films are always a true treat for those who follow the indie film scene because these two directors always offer something complex, well thought out, and with lots of heart. Like ""The Endless"", this films palette is very welcoming and homey feeling. The movie feels kinda cozy to watch at night with the lights out. It has that Moorehead and Benson distinctive sci fi taste where it feels as if they created something that THEY wanted to do first and foremost. I admire their pursuit of creative freedom and in my opinion, Justin Benson is one of the best indie writer/directors working today. ""Synchronic"" offers the same feel as ""The Endless"" but it's also a beast all its own... Still, this movie has its problems. The part with the scientist was too brief, a bit hollow, and uninformative BUT the way he and Steve came to interact is straight creepy. That first look at him in the closet where he turns his head really fast towards the flashlight is haunting and that is exactly the type of creepy scene you can expect from these guys. Also there is no explanation as to how the drug spread through out the city in such a way. If all the teens are disappearing, how is the word about this drug being spread and how are its effects even being described as? How can this be a popular party drug if there are no positive reviews to go with it? Basically its one of those things about a movie you have to just overlook because there is no satisfying answer. Lastly, there were about 10 minutes in the end of the movie where the tone suddenly shifted to something less interesting and it was slightly deflating right at the last minutes of something great. Luckily, the original feel of the film came back for the final scene and the movie closed nicely. Even with these flaws, i thought this movie was immensely compelling. I loved it. I loved the intrigue behind the grisly crime scenes and the super creepy nuances within them. This is the second super good sci fi horror to come out in 2021 following ""Possessor"". Both these movies are better than Christopher Nolan' s ""Tenet"" imo. Moorehead and Benson are moving up the ladder in their careers as ""Synchronic"" marks their biggest and most fleshed out film to date and I hope they can continue to grow even though this is sometimes the time where these film duos begin to break away as they go their own directions. They both are responsible for where they are today. They both contributed to their success as one is a cinematographer and director, the other a writer and director. It makes me sad to think that a golden opportunity for one and not the other could break these guys up in more than one way. Regardless, another exceptional outing from these guys snd I cant wait to see what's next to come",Synchronic

59,repojack,"""Just Say No!""",7,15 January 2021,"Synchronic is the most conventional, ""mainstream"" movie Aaron Moorhead and Justin Benson have made to-date and unfortunately that's a bit of a step back.They're previous outings, especially their slow burn low-budget Resolution and the fantastic The Endless, are mind benders that slowly unwind the respective film's underlying mystery. The astute viewer can figure out what's happening in this film's surreal prologue.And just in case you still can't figure it out, there's a bit too much exposition later on to hammer it home.Anthony Mackie is excellent. It's hard to not subconsciously see Marvel's Falcon, but overall he is an effective dramatic lead. The chemistry with fellow EMT Jamie Dorn is believable and authentic and adds poignancy to the films more dramatic moments.They visit some well crafted scenes where they are called in as EMT's, and their weary ""been here, done that "" banter is effective.While the last act is WAY too formulaic, overall it's an entertaining flick, and if I hadn't seen their previous outings, I probably would have enjoyed it more.P.S.

60,MoistMovies,Could've done a lot more with the subject material,6,13 January 2021,"The whole synthetic DMT aspect was something new and besides time travel i thought they were going to go even more weird with it.. But they didn't. And that's kind of a shame considering one of the many report people have from just normal DMT is talking to inter-dimensional beings or aliens.
I thought the scene where Mackie goes to the voodoo serimony would have been a good jumping off point for adding some more out there science fiction concepts related to DMT. The ending was very lackluster to me... a hero saves blah blah blah... I've seen that ending in 100x different ways.. fading into history to riding into the sunset..,.
The first half I was much more into it, would've been a 8/10 if i stopped there.. the end took two off for me. But thats because i found it bland and uninspired.
Would i recommend it... Not sure",Synchronic

The result was a slow turning of events, it caused viewers not to show empathy to the acting.It did have some interesting visual sequences during the drug-induced scenes. Mackie and others tried very hard to put the dramatic feel but at the end loses its strength.The usage of New Orleans landscape does have striking effects.

63,rmmil,Decent with stupid plot holes,3,15 January 2021,"This film is decent, and I love ""time travel"" concept films in general, but there are few scenes that made no sense in the ""no person would do that"" kind of way, or contained too many ""coincidences"", which heavily impacted my ability to suspend disbelief for the remainder of it (the scenes in question happening about 1/2 way thru the film).I haven't seen anyone else complain about this yet, so I'll rant about it here: WHY did the lead protagonist use his DOG to test if he could bring back living things? No one would do that. No one. Not if they loved their pet. He would have gone to a pet store and bought a mouse, or a snake, or anything. He wouldn't use his dog!Also, why does this drug that seemingly randomly places people in the past (depending on where you are standing...okay?), always place them within moments of mortal danger? No one is ever just dropped in a random field, no, they are placed inches from death. A frozen Ice Age tundra with nothing for miles...but a caveman is nearby, or a 16th century swamp...with a conquistador feet away, etc., etc. This film would have you believe in the far past everyone was constantly within 7 minutes of being killed. It was all just a little ""too much"" for me and took me out of it.And no one would take their darn dog!!",Synchronic

What It seems to lack is a more thought-out pace.
I give this a nice 6. Ending itself would make +1. I don't know, maybe the feeling of respect and quiet ""thank you"" on one end and personal sacrifice on the other got to me, so 7 is my rating.",Synchronic

There could be more time travel and less about the consequences.
I can see that a forth dimensional being would be able to see all of time and space and this is about a drug that can take you to any time.But.... the time and place changes with small changes in the starting point. This is ok but Only the past is shown in the time traveling. It will make more sense that this drug takes you to any point in the past because it has been written but cannot take you to the future because that is as yet unwritten.
It also does Not make sense that the drug can return you to your own time but does nothing if you move, it would make more sense that you ended up somewhere else in time and space, as if you had taken the drug at that spot instead of returning to your starting point. Or that you returned but to a different location.so, there are some holes in the plot but...Good Scripting

69,tresm87,"An outstandingly vibrant take on time travel, with captivating emotional depth within the characters.",8,14 January 2021,"It seems to me that many of the more negative reviews on here aren't very familiar with the ambitiously mind bending style of director/writer duo Justin Benson and Aaron Moorhead. Ive been a massive fan of theirs since Spring, and also have absolutely loved Resolution and The Endless. Their unique brand of audacious story telling, transformative visuals, and flabbergasting metaphors will not click with everyone. Synchronic is no different, and also might be their best work yet, though will undoubtedly fly under the radar like all their films.The film starts off with a bizarre engrossing sequence, and then establishes our main characters played by Anthony Mackie and Jamie Dorman within their intriguing New Orleans overnight setting. The 2 show great chemistry throughout and their paramedic careers intertwine with the plot perfectly. As the story progresses with all the visceral uncanny events, the emotional aspects of these characters start showing through complimenting the time travel aspects of the plot. Everything wraps up with a very gripping ending where time is not only the catalyst in all these events but a lesson. Anthony Mackie's performance was supreme.I want to expand on the brilliant visuals of this film and how immersive they were. Its clear to see that they had a much more solid yet humble budget for this film compared to their past few so thats a great sign for their next films. The sequences in which we travel back to different time periods are nearly flawless as far as overall setting, costume design, and cgi imagery. Im assuming they executed this even still on a way less budget than most time travel films which is truly genius. It looked highly realistic imo.Overall this is an amazing film imo, and an other success for the writing and directing prowess of the Benson/Moorhead duo. I can only hope they will finally get their due recognition with future more wide releases. I also implore fans of this film to go back and check their filmography.",Synchronic
70,andrewrye-06535,A nice Littel Hidden Gem,6,15 January 2021,"Not perfect but a good premise.
A good idea and although not fresh, more structured than other movies of the same theme.
The first part felt a bit muddled. I know they were building the characters but they took too long to do it. And some of the dystopian feel was wasted in the second half.
I really enjoy time travel or time altering movies, especially when it's supported by a good story line, This just missed the mark. But a good attempt.

A city that has still yet to recover entirely some 15 years since the horrific Hurricane Katrina in 2005. On a personal note Steve has an important and potentially life changing doctors appointment and Dennis, a family man with an 18 year old daughter who seems to be the glue to mom and dads happiness with another baby on the way. The two stumble upon a series of gruesome murders, cases that seem to make little sense and the cause of death or murder rears unable to be determined or made sense of whatsoever. The only connection between these cases is a new, unknown and highly volatile new designer drug, one pill in a black sealed package labeled Synchronic. Dennis' daughter Brianna appears very troubled and by chance stumbles upon the drug, looking an escape she takes it, later that night disappears. Steve takes it upon himself to investigate further as he too has known Brianna since she was a baby and cares for her like a daughter. Steve finds the last doses of the drug and in an attempt to find answers takes the drug, with otherworldly shocking results. He begins a sort of research program with the last doses of Synchronic and will stop at nothing to find Brianna and bring her home at any cost.The film was shot beautifully with shadowy urban grittiness paired with cosmic sci-fi flair and really puts a refreshing spin on this sub genre. This film has a very rich blend of everyday drama and sci-fi mind bending duplicity. Anthony Mackie does phenomenal work in these types of movies and paired with Jamie Dornan they share a solid on screen chemistry that helps the film hit viewers on a deep emotional level. We get to know these characters, we laugh, cry, and mourn with these characters. A woefully driven thrilling ride between temporal realities.",Synchronic
80,waltermwilliams,Synchronic is very trippy David Bowie,6,16 February 2021,"Big movies are back on the big screen
Proof of this is the latest joint sci-fi project from Justin Benson and Aaron Moorhead, both as Directors and Writers.
These boys clearly grew up watching Scully & Mulder and you can tell.
Set in New Orleans, ""Synchronic"" is ""very trippy David Bowie"" as Flight of The Concords would describe it.
It's an original concept that needed more exploration to be fully realised.
But let's address the Elephant in the room.
This is not as ""Nolanesque"" as the films promoters would have you believe.
This is no ""Inception"" or even ""Tenet"".
What starts as a normal police procedural movie with bizarre deaths being investigated by police and mopped up by paramedics working the Night Shift leads to time travel using a designer synthetic drug.
Don't try this at home children.
Marvels ""Falcon"", Anthony Mackie, is no stranger to sci-fi and plays his role as Steve the Ambo with conviction and intensity far beyond this script.
While Jamie Dornan as Dennis is 50 Shades from Fading to Grey in the background as his Paramedic buddy who's daughter goes missing.
Girl Gone and I mean really gone to another time and place.
Fun Fact: Steve's dog being named Hawking as an obvious nod to the late famous physicist Stephen Hawking....I wonder what he would have thought about their flawed science?
But it was cool that it's the same breed of dog as Doc Brown's dog, Einstein, in ""Back To The Future""...what happens to him is just cruel.
Critics say it's ""profoundly unsettling""...you be the judge.
There are some very gory scenes you will never forget.
That is guaranteed.
The ending was not what I envisaged although that rock in the park with the inscription clearly had to play a bigger part in the plot line.
""Synchronic"" is probably one of the better sci-fi films doing the rounds on the big screen, but it hasn't cracked the Top 5 at the Aussie Box Office...where currently 4 out of 5 movies are Australian.
A first for the local market due to the Pandemic and a lack of good film content from other countries.",Synchronic

88,Stream2BigScreen_Movie_Reviews,Synchronic Might Be Like A Timeless Piece Of Work,6,19 February 2021,"Let's talk about catching, Streamers. The best part of pandemic is the ability to catch up on all the junk you've missed on TV and movies. So, I finally got to catch a movie I thought sounded interesting in 2019, but it didn't release until the end 2020. Lord knows I wasn't spending $19.99 for the rental or risking my life in the theater for this movie, but, Synchronic, here I am. Synchronic is a movie that follows two New Orleans paramedics who have their lives torn apart during some chance encounters with horrific deaths linked to a designer drug. This is the drug of all drugs because the effects are more than bizarre and otherworldly. Check out the trailer below, but let's see what we got from this free Redbox streamer.""Drugs are bad, mmkay. Don't do drugs, mmkay"". That's the basic moral of this story. I'd go a bit further and say don't do drugs in New Orleans, but we all know that's just a hard ask. I mean I know life sucks but after seeing this new drug... life doesn't suck that bad. Anyway, New Orleans is one of my favorites cities, and I definitely appreciate movies investing in the city after it's been devastated so many times. That's really neither here nor there. The storyline in this movie takes a turn from the first 20 minutes to a sci-fi time travel-ly movie. While it was mostly random, it was also endearing and engrossing. It's one of those things where you enjoy it but you didn't even know you would enjoy this kind of thing. It's not quite original but it's also not something you've seen before. The best thing I can give you is that it's an odd mix of Limitless and Don't Let Go.Let's talk about the cast. First, your boy, Anthony Mackie does his thing. He really does know how to give you the most solemn, callous faces while also simultaneously letting you know he's going crazy on the inside. It's a weird and awesome acting talent. Mackie is paired with Mr. Gray himself, Jamie Dornan. Dornan while pretty awful in the 50 Shades of Gray series, not his fault but he didn't make it better, Dornan looks and feels more normal in this movie. Talk about setting the bar low. Just being normal is a step up in his acting career, smh. Either way, our leading fellas tried their best in this random flick.Let's get to it. Synchronic is a film that is hard to judge. It feels like two movies mixed into one which is strangely original but also a failing in itself. Just like the definition of synchronism, the movie displays chronological arrangement of historical events and personages so as to indicate coincidence or coexistence. Just like the definition it's interesting and boring at the same time, but somehow I just can't take my eye of it. So grab yourself a handful of popcorn and ""enjoy"" this puzzling feature.",Synchronic

Jamie Dornan is a very good actor but just didn't have much of a part which he should have had more interaction with Anthony's character. Ally Ioannides character was two dimensions couldn't see rushing off to save her the story lacked a back story on her.

Up until that point, it seems to be nothing but a bunch of odd alternating scenes as the EMTs keep showing up to deal with apparent drug overdoses and killings. Look, I'm all for a good slow-burn thriller. But it shouldn't take you almost half the movie to explain the premise. Worse, when they finally do explain it, it's total exposition dialogue. The writers should have been more creative and used those first 40 minutes to reveal much more.I watched another 10 minutes and then turned it off. No spoilers, but once they explained the core plot, I was like, ""Really?"" It just seemed so insanely absurd. Most sci-fi movies require a leap of faith to buy into the story. This one was just too hard to swallow.I also felt the two leads were very wooden in their delivery. Halfway into the movie, I cared nothing about anyone.

109,bramstayer,Anthony Mackie is in EVERYTHING these days. I enjoyed this more than expected,7,14 May 2021,"I like ""time is a lie"" type films..this is such a film.I thought the drug angle while necessary, gave it a weird dingy kind of scarier beginning; so it improved with every minute after the first 15. I love sci-fi and I think this a tight great date movie. It had good actors making the most out of their kinda tepid dialogue which helped alot. This isn't a huge CGI contender though I loved never knowing when our hero would end up. The effects were of a good quality like the dialogue not too much- just right.In all, a good film that used it premise well and a good 140 minutes watch. They COULD have made a slower, more detailed time travel thing or more on the daughter's storyline, but I was grateful they didn't. It would have been familiar ground anyway.I JUST saw Mackie in the Woman in the Window. A small role but man, he's everywhere. That's a good thing! I like him; he and Jamie were a great team.",Synchronic
110,neoclone07,Lost in time,6,26 January 2021,"Synchronic is a mix: a sci-fi mistery in its essence, it also has a bit of slow horror, fantasy, drama and even comedy! Some people could even say it's also a buddy movie... and it is in a certain way, though I personally think a buddy movie must keep the buddies tagging along, and we don't see that in Synchronic. Mackie and Dornan have a gripping friendship for sure, but all action happens on Mackie, rather than them sharing it.
The score and cinematography are delightful, the great thing here. The ominious, dark distorted tones of the soundtrack helps creating a supernatural feeling that something otherworldly is about to happen... until we find out it won't... which isn't bad at all... I just... I don't know... if the writer takes us away from a cliché, at the same time makes the movie completely flips its tone. So, it's up to you enjoy or not this prism. I myself was expecting something a little bit more... lovecraftian. But I enjoyed the movie, I think it was ok... the story itself had been seen before in a different suit, but this new take on time travel can catch your attention.
Besides the thrilling score, we have a thumbs up here with cinematography. It engulfs the characters in shades and gives us a melancholic, nostalgic, decayed New Orleans, again creating the dark stage for the two friends.
Overall, Sinchronic is a decent movie to watch, even with its plotholes and mixed genres, if you don't have something else to watch, consider watching it.",Synchronic
111,larmo,Boring. Better as a TV mini series.,4,18 April 2021,"Boring. Where possible, I give this movie two and half stars, only because the acting, and plot are reasonably good. I found the emphasis on the principal characters' mundane day to day lives, and the ultimate disappearance of a family member. Of no particular interest to me. Also, the premise that a drug could somehow be a vehicle for time travel, required a larger budget to really make it work as a plot. The time traveling character, not knowing where he will be transported to in time. Doesn't take any offensive or defensive weapons with him. After the first or second trip, you would think that he would understand how at risk his life could be. Final analysis. Decent acting, with a plot device that deserved a bigger budget, and better storyline. This movie may have been better as a TV mini series.",Synchronic

And it's not the incomprehensible gaps in logic that sank this sucker for me, or the mostly mediocre-to-poor acting (except for lead Anthony Mackie, who was solid), it was the lack of originality and dramatic tension. If watching this movie were like taking Synchronic, let's just say we'd all be snoozing for 7 minutes, or waiting impatiently, toe-tapping, until we got zapped back to the present, relieved that the mostly dull trip was over.

It's such a well-rounded idea, and makes for a great Sci-Fi film, but something was just so off-putting about the pacing and direction of what this film was attempting to be. I must say that the dark and grittiness of this film is probably the best in its entirety, but it only maintains this illusion temporarily, as far as the first half of the movie goes. The rest becomes a bit of a mess, and it seems that there was a lot of pushing and pulling on direction and poignant writing, and it became very much bare bones. I find this so odd because The Endless, was the complete opposite of what this was. To me, I feel that Synchronic is after thought, and it's a film that may leave you more unsatisfied than intrigued. Their first act is easily the best part of the film, after that, it leads into confusing bewilderment and not so engaging storytelling. The idea was awesome, and I liked the possibilities of what it could do to the main story, but the way it was done and handled, felt very amateurish (considering this is the third or fourth film by Benson,) and unfortunately I had to turn the film off about 3/4 of the way through. It wasn't amazing, it wasn't horrible, but I could say it's a good first time watch if you can grimace through the last 40 or so minutes that the movie has to offer.",Synchronic

The main drawback with directing partners Justin Benson and Aaron moorhead's latest collaborative effort is that all its attempts at grandiosity and profundity are stymied by a very formulaic script. Don't get me wrong this is , despite its dark subject matter, a very enjoyable popcorn and beer movie,but the premise suggested something a lot less pedestrian and more challenging. Two paramedics working the graveyard shift, start noticing a pattern in the patients they are treating. Instead of the usual liquored or doped up violent assault victims, they instead find wide eyed living zombies who it seems have ingested a new designer drug named synchronic. What is this drug ? And why does it leave such a trail of madness in its wake? I won't divulge anything further as I don't want to enter spoiler territory and spoilers suck, I will say however that despite its narrative shortcomings - just imagine what David cronenberg or even Christopher Nolan could have done with this film's premise- this isn't a terrible movie, the lead actors are particularly good and the oppressive mood is effectively maintained thoughout, it's just not the thought provoking, head trip experience i was hoping for.",Synchronic

""time travel"" experience itself (of 7 mins duration). The entire film has the look and feel of True Detective. It's very reminiscent of that series, both in the themes covered, stories and plotlines, overarching narrative on the human condition, but also the visual landscape and colour filters used to give everything a grey, bland drabness, helping to echo the themes of despair, decay, helplessness and hopelessness. Very surreal scenes.
In this film, the usual ""stoner"" narrative of ""Where am I?"" is more like ""When am I?"" It also begs the existential question, ""Why am I?"" Or where is this experience we call life leading to, and what will be its ultimate finality and destination? That is a question that perhaps only G-d can answer, but is still something everyone should reflect on at least every once in a while, and struggle to come to terms with - not coming to terms with death, but perhaps how to live the most meaningful life possible.",Synchronic

The idea was probably okay-ish for non sci-fi connoisseurs, but sci-fi fans will definitely find it absurd. The characters are again, poorly written, you can't connect with them since they don't connect with each other either. It feels like the protagonist wants to save his friend's daughter just out of the blue, and the only connection you've seen between the daughter and the protagonist is a depthless conversation that he cut short. Maybe there where more, but I swear I spent more time thinking about interesting things, so maybe I missed it... I really didn't care about that girl, in fact it could have been the protagonist's plumber, it would have had the same impact. I'm always amazed that with the amount of talent out there, this kind of movie can still see the light of the day.

Thankfully, that's not what this movie is about.I really enjoyed it despite a couple flaws (and really, a typical hollywood movie has more cringe-worthy flaws than this).There was a technical problem where a number of dialog lines were muffled/slurred and I couldn't make out what they were saying without switching on subtitles. It's like they needed to position the mic better or reshoot the scene and tell the actors not to mumble. But overall an interesting movie, and I liked the methodical approach by the character to figure things out.A couple things I didn't quite get, but are minimal:
I didn't get how the written message connected with the character. Or why the message was spelled wrong. Or maybe it wasn't a message at all and I read too much into it?Couldn't a pill be taken to a chemist to figure out what it's made of and therefore manufacture more?

Except it didn't deliver. Some scenes were interesting and the concept had potential, but it never fully fleshed out and unfortunately stayed at the level of an hour long TV program. The dialogue was frequently muddled, low volumes ; weird accents so that it was not relaxing to have to concentrate so hard on ""hearing"" what the actors were saying. I expect dialogue problems when I am watching some British shows----but not in an all English language movie. I do not have hearing or cognitive issues and found this to be a problem throughout the movie. The opening concept of the snakebite was interesting but went nowhere ; the scientist who created Synchronic was interesting but went nowhere. The examination of the Dannelly marriage is boring. Brianna needed to be more complex and sympathetic so that the rescue was intense. I knew more about/cared more about the dog than Brianna because she only had a few lines before she disappeared.

It doesn't seem like they intend a sequel, so maybe they just didn't have the creative juices or budget to build more upon the world, which is too bad.All-in-all, this movie was worth the time and money.

No. Neanderthals looked nothing like that nor did humans who lived during the Ice Age. Also, compared to how that guy looked and a lot of people in Africa STILL look. Not too much difference. Hah.

When the credits rolled, it felt like it had only just opened it's idea up to me and then seemingly hastily wrapped things up. It ended ""like an unfinished great conversation, because the person you were discussing with had to rush to end it"".While I accept the overall situation where it ended, I felt like something satisfying in the conclusion was missing.
Like that feeling you get when you think there's one more snack in the bag only to realize it's already empty after all. Like.. it's just a little bit short from that satisfaction you expected.
I don't know, the potentially pretentious sounding metaphores are the only way I can really describe how it left me feeling. Just a tiny bit short from a great film. Not sure why.
Infact, the whole movie kinda feels like that, now that I think about it.
Just a little short from being.. fulfilling in what it's aiming to do.Especially one quote from a deep, beersipping Anthony Mackie later in the movie hit me hard in the feels for some reason...

It wasn't because it was a well-thought out script. Why have the chemist in the film without following that character?

I think I'd like to see them together in another project. Problems: Slow AF. The movie's central plot doesn't start until midway through. Dialog - it's clunky and uneven throughout. The dramatic points are ill-placed and halfhearted. Music - it does nothing to subvert the slow, laudanum feeling of swimming through syrup throughout the whole movie. It's trying to create a mood, but it's got only on one speed - opium den. Predictability - even though it's a sleepy, half-lidded movie you can see where it's going and you know how it ends. Still, I watched the whole movie for the interplay between Mackie and Dornan. The acting all around was estimable given the material they had to work with. It's not necessarily one to miss, but don't expect it to get you fired up and talking about it afterward, unless it's to talk about what you would have done differently to make it a better film.",Synchronic
176,selfedluke,"Didn't enjoy it, random story that's hard to care about",2,25 October 2020,"This was a lame attempt at a trippy dark thriller with a uninspired premise that never takes off. It's one of those movies you struggle to care about and find hard to take seriously. Plot centers around two paramedics who keep finding overdose victims taking the same DMT-derivative pill, leading one of them to eventually ""test"" them on himself, which magically transport him into different pasts based on which square inch of his room he is standing on. Yes- this is a movie about pills that physically transport people into the past. Gimmicky? Sure. But in theory this could have been made into a heady, smart sci-fi movie if the script/world building were good enough.Much of the dialogue was empty and boring; the first half of the plot is a melodrama with unnatural sounding and forced conversation. The main paramedic weaves in and out of a series of rescues in which the directors don't even try have him do proper protocol (they make a bunch of dumb, obvious errors in judgement no real EMT would do). Then we see glimpses of his poorly directed personal life in which he has boring conversations with depressed drug addicts, drinks beer to pass the time, and fights with his best friend and wife who weirdly appear in and out of the movie like afterthoughts.It attempts establish dramatic and deep scenes but they come across like cardboard.There's even randomly inserted dumb 2020-woke dialogue that had nothing to do with the scenes or what these characters would say to each other in real life (""Dude you can't drive the ambulance down that district, a black guy driving around there? Would be more dangerous than half our calls!"")The second half of the plot is the paramedic ""testing"" the drug by doing it a bunch of times and getting thrown in catoonish-time periods where rednecks and ghosts and wild animals instantly attack him. Then the only decent part happens- he goes on a somewhat ingesting journey to find and and rescue a friend who got stuck in a past timeline.In general if I had to praise it for something, the directors seemed to have some cool moments fleshed out in their head (the space sequences, the great editing transitions) but these were not enough to make up for a empty story and repetitive formulaic bleak characters with dialogue that sounds like it's fresh off the Amazon TV factory for another random genre show.",Synchronic

Unfortunately, every aspect of the production fell quite short of the mark.Jamie Dornan seemed a bit bewildered and never seemed to be able to deliver his lines believably, but this was fine since the script was just awful. None of the characters were believable and their dialogue was stilted and unnatural.Low budget shouldn't mean low quality; this should just be an opportunity to get creative and do more with less. Sadly...they managed to do less with less.The sole exception was the development of Anthony Mackie's character, Steve. He came across as genuine, even if the circumstances of the story were bizarre: ( In the Antebellum South, people didn't look or act as they were portrayed here, for starters. Blue-eyed White folk didn't live in Louisiana during the Ice Age and Louisiana was NOT an Arctic wasteland populated by wandering mammoths ). The other characters were all throw-aways and I could care less what happened to any of them.I would like to see this concept redone with better actors, delivering better lines and with much more attention to detail.This was disappointing.

The thematics of this film are a perfect example of how messed up modern society of 2021 is. To drive home a strong narrative, with interesting ideas and solid relationship building we must inject race.

Isn't regret of life choices and loss of love enough?

Everything about this narrative is excellent, interesting and new apart from the Anthony Mackie perspective. It's hard being a black man. Now and definitely in the past. Yeah really thanks, history is bad mo okay.
Just feels like lazy writing from a couple of white guys. Inject race, it's cool, relevant and of the moment.
In ten years I hope we look back on current media and say this is infantile because today the messages of diversity as a point not as a standard seem forced and a shortcut to a meaning.

193,artistwriter-54705,"A lot of great ideas, not enough time, and not enough of a budget.",5,27 January 2021,"""Synchronic"" or ""Be in your 40's before you experiment with designer drugs.""If you are looking for ""What Dreams May Come"" this is going to be a massive disappointment. When I saw that movie my mother had died recently, and much like ""Contact"" this film had to be made for the audience that lives in the real world, and not the world of academics and scholars. Meaning that if you're one of those movie goers who believes this is a thinking person's movie, you are likely still smoking dope in a basement somewhere.This is a more or less spoiler free review, and this is where I say some things about the film that are actually constructive and kind. It is also where I will be a little unkind about a few things that irritated me.The premise is that you have to paramedics who show up in the aftermath of some people using a designer drug called ""Synchronic"" where when someone takes it, very very weird things happen. Early on in the story, you find some people getting high, and then seeing something very very strange, then of course bad things happen to them. These two paramedics played by Anthony Mackie and Jamie Dornan are the only two real actors in this movie outside of Bill Oberst Jr. who is in this movie for less than 2 minutes in one of the least threatening roles I have seen him in.After responding to a really screwed up situation and a mishap, Anthony Mackie's character suddenly has a lot of things to deal with. That being said, it is this course correction for his character that leads him on a path of both trying to help his friend, and his own sense of having lived a pointless life.This film hits some interesting topics.Recreational drug use, casual sex, alcoholism, drug addiction in the field of first responders. Racism implied or otherwise, history, time travel, pharmacology, designer drugs, human physiology, superstition, slavery, physics, our inevitable demise, and parenting.The problem isn't that this film doesn't put forth the effort. It's that there was way too much potential story to be distilled down into a film that was under 2 hours. The reason why this film fails on a lot of levels is that it had to be dumbed down and shortened so the average American would sit through it.When you hear Anthony Mackie give his ""Sermon"" to the guy in the back of the ambulance, you can tell that this movie probably had about 5 hours of extra footage on the cutting room floor that would have likely made Jodorowsky and David Fincher look like amateur hour for the simple fact that whenever you bring up Einstein and his ideas, you really can get long winded and still not get it right. Instead they did a summation of a letter he wrote. I think had Mackie channeled Sam Jackson playing ""Jules"" at the diner, it would have had a lot more effect. Instead there were some jump cuts and they shut it down quickly. The issue for me is that this could have been a very very smart movie made with a larger budget, and it simply did not happen for reasons likely Covid19 related and of course the intellect of the script.Which is the problem with smart film makers who want to make a really great film that is intelligent and captivating. You will be brought to an office and when you talk to the producers of this film with your pitch and you tell them you want to make an intelligent movie for smart people, they will laugh you out of the room. ""Nobody in America wants to watch an intelligent movie that makes them feel dumb. They want a dumb movie that will make them feel smart!""So I do give the writers credit to a degree. They could be as dumb as hamsters for all I know but I am going to bet they have either read a book or two on physics, or have done a lot of recreational drugs. That said, I can tell you from my own experiences after having a tooth extracted there is a certain pliability with regard to reality if you are on the right kind of stuff. That being said, this movie is not a terrible film, it's just not what it could have been with the potential it had.The acting in it by Dornan, and Mackie is great. The rest of the cast is not as involved and their parts probably not as defined as these two. What I can tell you is that Mackie of all the characters seems to do the best job at being believable. Unfortunately the special effects were not as fantastic as they could have been which made selling some of the scenes laughable. If you see the film you know exactly what it is I am talking about.The cinematography is well done, the color palette is nice and some of the shots do a good job of conveying the mood of the film. They do well in the sense of making you question what it is you are seeing, unfortunately there was just not enough time to really tell more of an engaging story due again likely to Covid and or Budget. When I saw the trailer for this film initially I really thought that it was going to have some amazing visuals. Nope. Not even remotely as cool as what was advertised in the trailers.The film is also very very predictable as about a third of the way through the film I knew how it was going to play out pretty much. Not that it is patently obvious, (it is) it is that I have seen pretty much the same movie at least 20 times where the lead character does what the lead character does. Given that the character is a black man involved with time travel, you have the predictable tropes of confronting racism and slavery which seems like it was shoe-horned into the script in order to sell it. Where this film does not hit the cliche' button, is the ending. HOWEVER... I am not real pleased with how it ended.There are three particular bits of dialog spoken by three different characters, and none of them are every expanded on, and in the case of the one character utterly destroys the film for me because of what could have potentially been a game changing moment in the film and taken this movie to a much better and much more intellectual conclusion. BUT NO!!! While I do not doubt the post it not board with all the various parts of the movie had something on there about it, I am almost 100 percent positive that someone came along and said ""No we have to make this movie dumber. Remember folks Asses in seats is how movies get made."" Which is funny considering this was a rental and this movie was made in 2019, and we are just now seeing it?There are some really decent effects at some points of this film but that is not enough to really carry the film. The acting outside the two primary characters is pretty marginal considering. Am I an acting coach? No. I do however deserve an academy award for pretending to be a well adjusted adult after the last year and a half. Which is how I judge everyone else's acting ability.What is my take away from this movie? Young people cannot be allowed to drink or smoke because that leads to bad behavior and poor decision making that can cause you to regret the life you have, and wish for the life you could have had as you watch your friend have a lot of sex with a lot of people and never get married or saddled with kids.Then the other take away is if you're in your 40's and feel like your life is empty, the best thing for you to do, is start taking designer drugs made by a guy who is just waiting to come out of the closet. I mean that quite literally, not metaphorically as there is a character who actually comes out of A closet, and not THE closet in the movie.All things being what they are, I have seen a lot worse this year already, and judging from what I am seeing being released, it's going to be a massive dry spell before we see anything really that great for a while. Hope this spoiler free review is helpful in your decision to go read a book and say no to drugs.",Synchronic

It was a bitter pill to swallow as a viewer, resulting in the overall impression of this movie being contrived, mediocre, and no more imaginitive than many TV shows which have gone before and dealt with time travel in a similar, 'can't be bothered to get into the science', manner. They generally end up planting their unsurprised actors in the past, as this film did, why? Well, bringing the future to life is expensive and requires imagination. Instead, we have to settle for swamps, snow and old battle fields etc for our time travelling fix. Sadly, it doesn't work and at the end of this very disappointing film, l could have fake cried way better than the embarrassing effort at emotion it was my cringeworthy misfortune to witness in Synchronic.

And once again, they didn't fail.Since the story itself is a bit more straightforward than their previous movies, it does not rely on huge twists (although the ending itself is pretty ambiguous), but it is still original and entertaining. Visually stunning and unique, yet so true to Benson's and Moorhead's aesthetics.The heart of the movie, however, is the dynamic between characters. And, my God, it's absolutely enchanting; I have to say probably the most heartwarming sci-fi movie I have ever seen. Anthony Mackie and Jamie Dornan have incredible bro-chemistry, as they effortlessly portray true friendship between two men, without relying on clichés and toxic masculinity tropes.There is also some masterfully done social commentary, without it being on the nose and yet successfully portraying the horrors of human history and perhaps future (such as racism and war).Not sure why it got such mixed reviews, probably from those unfamiliar with Benson's and Moorhead's work or from those who expected a bit more complicated narrative.

217,junkstuff-7,Poorly made film with dumb take on trite topic,1,25 October 2020,"The only reason this movie could possibly be getting decent reviews is because so few films are being handed to theaters. In this case, movie execs clearly found this at the bottom of their trashcan and decided to pander to starving theaters by highlighting how Falcon from the Avengers was in it.The tripe starts with a purposefully out of focus closeup of nothing exciting. If only they had never bothered to focus the thing it would have improved the overall quality. We're then treated to wandering around with some contemptible people until the camera eventually gets to the person who got the short end of the stick and thus was forced to find a way to act as the protagonist.Heck, the film at one points make fun of how cliche he is in one of the more inspired lines in the film. There's other laughable moments, but only because they're so bad.The premise itself is dumber than the writing. A pill is able to transport certain people into the past for seven minutes. In other words, not only are they going to re-hash the trite topic of time travel, but they're not even going to spend time developing any historical relevance or accuracy. Nor do they even try and offer any semblance of sense to how the pill works. Better if they had the characters say arcanic words that zaps to the past than the stupid medical babble they mispronounce. As for character development, so little time is spent developing viewer empathy that the only character viewers should feel for is the dog. Perhaps if they had knocked this pile of pus down to a twenty minute Twilight Zone episode that spent half of its time focusing on the dog, there would be something re-deeming about it. As it is, this should already be leading Razzie nominations.",Synchronic

219,feralshade,This movie is marhmallows,3,26 January 2021,"Remember when you were very young, and thought it'd be a really great idea to eat a huge plate full of marshmallows for dinner--then, much later you realized, out of common sense (or hopefully not experience), that it was a terrible idea and you'd have gotten sick?That's exactly what the tone this movie is like. On the surface, it answers the question, ""what if all the characters are stoned?"" Something that can and has worked (somewhat) for comedies, but absolutely ruins a drama like Synchronic. After 10 minutes of watching literally all the characters lazily bumble around (a cop says, ""don't touch cause it's like evidence or whatever.""; a mother says, ""haha i think you broke my baby"", etc), I began to lose interest too. I feel like half the movie was watching drugged paramedics drive to different deceased OD victims. Literally all the ambulance calls were drug overdoses. There was nothing that compelled me to engage with the characters.When it finally arrived at the scifi bit---the time-travel mini plot device that attracted me to this film in the first place, it wasn't developed at all. It's like the writers had no appreciation for the genre, and just played connect-the-dots at 2am so they could just get it over with and turn their attention back to the non-scifi bits---which was essentially nonexistent.The characters were poorly written--not just in terms of non-meaningful dialogue, but also in the progression and depth of their relationships and personal growth...of which, there was no evidence for either.Here's what I think happened:
Anthony Mackie (brilliant performance and actor in general) was handed a script, liked the premise at quick glance, and signed on without knowing who the director was. The director then treated the project like a toddler finger painting on a wall....which is to say awfully (except in the eyes of the director and his friends).This is my new example of how a bad director can ruin a film. Though I also blame Mackie's agent for allowing his client to see this script. That actor has too much talent for it to be squandered with bad representation.",Synchronic

222,vivek28593,A missed opportunity,6,28 February 2021,"WARNING: MAJOR SPOILERSThe central plot of the movie is that there is this drug that can take you back in time and one paramedic must use this drug to rescue the other paramedic's daughter who got stuck in the past. The first three-quarters of the movie is about the protagonist discovering the drug, experimenting with it, and finally figuring out what happened to his colleague's daughter, then going back in time to rescue her.I found the story to be exciting though it could have been executed better. Some parts of it were gripping and I was excited to see what would happen next. But what should have been action-packed sequences were given an air of mystery/suspense which kind of ruined the mood. High-energy music would have made the scenes so much better. Moreover, cutting scenes short arbitrarily to add to the suspense did not help at all.It wasn't clear until halfway through the movie, what the promise of the story was. And once it became clear, things moved too quickly. It always helps to clearly establish the promise of the story in the first quarter of the movie, especially in sci-fi.The ending was so unsatisfying. We don't know if the hero managed to come back or not, and it wasn't the cliffhanger the director probably meant it to be.In short, the movie had a lot of potential, special effects were used brilliantly, actors were great, but the story was executed poorly.

In a dingy and totally unglamorized New Orleans, two paramedics stumble across an epidemic of deaths and unexplainable injuries linked to Synchronic. Jamie Dornan, ostensibly the more grounded of the two, is a man so amiably resigned to a life he didn't plan that he's not even bitter anymore; Anthony Mackie is haunted by demons, some of which are personal but some of which are the demons that haunt every Black person in the U. S. today.There are loud clunking noises of plot machinery being moved around when Jamie Dornan's 18-year-old daughter ends up taking Synchronic at a party, but hey! You gotta move that plot around somehow, right?There was plenty of stuff that didn't work for me. Like the opening sequence: lurid, drug hallucinations that turn out not to be hallucinations! Yawn.I can only imagine that this weird intro was a last minute thing. Because not only was Justin Benson up against a limited budget, he was also up against the whole Covid thing, which even made publicizing big Hollywood vehicles incredibly difficult. I guess the PR team-the drunk guys at the bar who Venmo-ed Benson the scratch to make the movie-thought this would grab viewers.Beep!It didn't.PLUS this was actually the third or fourth of the weird Synchronic-linked incidents, so how come it was shown first?In a way, though, gaffes like this made the movie even more interesting to me. They're like some sort of cinematic equivalent of viewing Michaelangelo's ""Prisoners.""

If someone is writing a script, it least make it be believable.The idea that a drug maker invented a way to make people time travel and all he wants to do is get rid of the drugs, is insane.

And that's unfortunate because the concept here is really cool and I think with better writing and less bland and uninspired directing/cinematography, this could have turned out to be a modern sci-fi/thriller classic.The acting from the two leads, Anthony Mackie and Jamie Dornan is definitely solid, especially Mackie. However unlike Mackie's character, I didn't find Dornan's to be particularly interesting nor compelling, which is disappointing considering that his character has an important connection to the heart of the story.The visual effects are pretty great but they could have really popped more if supported by directing and cinematography that didn't look and feel as bland as it was at times.Synchronic also has some serious issues with pacing scattered throughout the runtime which was very hard not to notice, and at times the consistency of tone just wasn't quite there. At times it's a very dark and bleak watch, then there will be scenes that are quite funny but it just didn't work as well as it sounds like it would due to the vast contrasts.To sum it up, it's a decent movie that is quite enjoyable and gripping enough to make you care somewhat.

259,moiravanderputt,"Good idea, fun to watch, but ultimately let down by some illogical writing",6,11 May 2021,"After watching the trailer my friends and I decided to watch the movie because we thought the overall idea of the story seemed interesting. The beginning of the movie started off pretty strong. I liked the use of the drug as a sort of ""time travel device."" The cgi and acting was decent and good enough to make the movie intriguing and engaging. I also liked some of the more philosophical thoughts explored in the movie about death and time. Although, I feel like these ideas were mostly kept on surface level and were not explored far enough.However, some things in the movie were disappointing. Steve bringing his dog was one of the things that let my friends and I down the most. There is no logical reason for Steve to use his dog as an experiment. He could literally go to a pet store and buy a rat instead of taking his dog. Stuff like this really takes you out of the movie since it's very hard to believe that Steve would actually put his dog at risk like this.Another thing that was disappointing was the ending sequence. While Steve is being confronted by the man with the gun, he does not check his watch once. If he had seen that he had around five seconds left he could have tried to quickly run/jump towards Brianna and the stone. Maybe Steve would have been shot while running/jumping towards Brianna. But still, it would make more sense for Steve to wamt to go back home at the risk of being shot, than to be stuck in an war zone filled with racist soldiers.The last thing that bothered us was the handshake at the end. Steve sacrificed himself to safe Dennis' daughter, and all that Dennis does is shake his hand? These guys have been friends for over 18 years and in their last moment together they decide to shake hands? A good hug between friends could have made this ending a little better.In the end, this movie was still enjoyable. If you like sci-fi and don't really care about plot holes, this movie is a good watch.",Synchronic

262,noltbe,One of the worst movies of all time...,1,24 January 2021,"What can I say? The plot is utterly absurd, the characters could not be more artificial, and there are absolutely no redeeming characteristics of this film. It could very well be the worst movie I've ever attempted to watch. As a physician, I can tell the person who wrote this knows nothing about medicine or even basic science (but thinks they do) and probably has an IQ hovering somewhere around 80... that may even be generous. This movie is proof that even the dumbest people can somehow convince others to give them money to produce such an absolute dumpster fire of a movie. In conclusion, this movie single-handedly made me lose faith in humanity.",Synchronic
263,szgadam,Complete waste of a great concept,3,20 January 2021,"What a disappointment.... The movie comes up with an interesting and good concept, then wastes 60-65 minutes of it's ~100 minutes playtime with an utterly meaningless drama between two, painfully superficial characters and barely spends anytime with it's interesting concept.Most of the movie is Z-category bland drama, small part of it is an undeveloped, but good time travel concept. A massive waste.",Synchronic

Could have been Really interesting, could have been as good as interstellar with this concept...unfortunately the writing and directing just dumbs everything down. 95% of this movie is just dry scenes and filler conversation that is just the furthest thing from interesting.

272,sarabowles-84360,Good actors in an intellectually insulting and poorly written movie,3,8 February 2021,"Ok, there have been a million time travel movies. Primer is one of the better ones, but frankly none of them address the fact that if you are standing in a spot, and you are transported back one year, you will be floating in the vacuum of space because the planet is spinning, it's orbiting the sun, which is ripping through space at high speed.Moving past the time/space gap in the science... a pill moves you back in time? A pill?!? Does that pill dissolve so effectively that it permeates every single cell in your body? And how the flying frick does an ingested pill affect your clothing? Further, the things you touch go back with you? The pill magically knows the boundaries of, say, a dog or a dog's leash? But not the couch you're sitting on? There are kid's movies that approach the concept of time travel with a little more effort.The acting was good. The effects were ok. Every single mild twist was absurdly predictable and they've all been done a dozen times before. I honestly regret that I spent money on Prime to watch this. If it had been free, it would have been an ok show in the background while you're doing your taxes or something. But, I'm sorry, devoting your attention to this is absolutely unrewarding.",Synchronic

275,andrayalinton,"Great concept, horrible follow through",5,22 April 2021,"Honestly, the whole idea of a time travel drug being used to find a missing kid is cool, but the way the story was set up was just plain awful. There are certain plot lines that were entirely unnecessary and made no impact on the actual story. It just felt like the writers were trying to come up with drama and heartfelt moments, but it just seemed out of place and useless. I give it a 5 because it was interesting enough to watch through it, but the whole thing was a mess.",Synchronic
276,johnhford-78894,Honestly amazing,10,24 April 2021,"To be quit honest most people would never understand the power of true love or friendship, most people never value the moment, most people never value how a moment can create A memory the lasts a lifetime, The sad part is People take things for granted in life and fail to live in the moment. This is actually incredible movie if you understand it and if you understanding the meaning behind it.Most of these critics bashing the movie probably have never went through much in life Or don't have value life, or never coming close to losing it losing loved ones, With that being said no matter how smart someone thinks they are until they say Face death themselves they have no clue.Thank you for making such an incredible movie.",Synchronic

278,kensimon-40021,One of the better time travel movies,9,9 August 2021,"All time travel stories suffer from inconsistencies, because no one knows how it would work if it did really work, and because time travel itself creates paradoxes. So, it's best to just relax and enjoy the story and not be too critical about the technical details. This was a good story with a good and honorable main character who does the best he can under very difficult circumstances. Having read a lot of science and physics stuff as an amateur, I can say that the description of time being like a phonograph record (every sound exists on the record all at the same time) is very close to Einstein's mathematical description of spacetime. All in all, a good story well told.",Synchronic

280,bigdog225,Ending ruined it for me,4,13 May 2021,"He didnt have to sacrifice himself to bring his friends daughter back, and why didnt the daughter go back and try to save him.

281,happyholland1,Interesting Sci-Fi Premise With Good Performances,7,28 April 2021,"Synchronic definitely has a lot going for it and in the process, turned out to be a nice, low-budget sci-fi film. It seemingly begins as a horror film with sci-fi elements but the sci-fi premise quickly overshadows the other aspects and leaves you with a time-bending narrative that left me satisfatied.Beginning with a haunting opening scene accompanied with some striking visuals, the heart of the movie lies with the two leads, who are both performed very well by Mackie and Dornan. Playing two EMTs, much of the movie is dedicated to their friendship and lots of dialogue is exchanged in order to set up their relationship. The dialogue is well-written and the characters are relatable, however their is a bit too much of it. Many scenes are spent establishing their relationship to each other and to Dornan's family and while these scenes are well done, some of the scenes are redundant after a certain point. Dornan's daughter plays a pivotal role in the film, but more scenes should have focused on her and her connection to the two leads. It would've helped to add more dramatic weight to the climax.Even though time travel has been prevalent in dozens of movies, this one adds a nice layer to it. There's a lot of fun to be had in an extended scene where Mackie's character attempts to discover the rules of time travel and the movie does a good job of following it's internal logic. Even when it becomes convoluted at a certain point, the film is good at guiding the viewer through the rules.The visuals and sound design are what really set this movie apart from other time-bending thrillers. As the effects of the Synchronic drug become clear, the visuals and specials effects are used in great detail, especially for such a low-budget movie. Seeing all the different time periods was a very fun and unexpected addition.Synchronic does suffer from some generous contrivances in order to move the plot along. After taking great detail to explain the laws of time travel, the climax wraps up with a few scenes that were very convenient in order for the main characters to progress. Since I was having fun with most of the film, this didn't hurt my enjoyment too much, but for a movie that takes itself very seriously, it did take me out of the movie to a certain degree.For fans of mind-bending thrillers, Synchronic is definitely worth checking out. Anthony Mackie and Jamie Dornan do not disappoint in their roles and the story is very fun to dissect as it progresses. Shortening the runtime and eliminating some plot holes would have fixed the main issues but it's a still a worthwhile adventure to check out.",Synchronic
282,carlosdoughty101,Started okish before it became nonsense,4,5 April 2021,"Poor character development and script. The concept for the film was ok and had scope to be a good film.

283,crystal-irene,Who signed off on this? Its horrible.,3,18 April 2021,"While Jamie is a great actor, he perpetually looks 28, beard or not.. not even close to having an 18 year old daughter. Also, having the dog dissappear lost you thousands of fans. The ending sucked so much.. Basically if you would like to force depression on yourself, this is for you. I truly feel like I wasted the last 2 hours of my life.. I would never recommend this movie to anyone.",Synchronic

Or maybe do- I read them first and was blown away at their innacuracy. Benson and Morehead deliver on mind-bending drama, mixed with the perfect amount of sci-fi and action, once again.SPOILER AHEAD:, I was extremely tense throughout this movie. For one, the time travel scenes were crazy nerve-wracking, even knowing that the protagonist would almost certainly at least make it to the end, and therefore almost gauranteed to survive each 7-minute jaunt. Additionally, I spent the majority of my viewing time filled with dread because I knew there was a 50/50 chance it might have a sad ending. In the end i was wrong- it made me disappointed in an unsuspected way. I didnt factor the possibilty of a 50% good outcome.Due to that subvesion of expectations, the gorgeous cinematography, and unique and well explored concept (just dont think about it too much or the glaring potholes might obscure the screen) I am thoroughly impressed with this film..",Synchronic

293,ConstantlyElongatingKangaroo,A good story that is superbly made,8,8 October 2019,"If you are a fan of Benson and Moorhead's previous work, you will most likely enjoy this feature too as they maintain their same storytelling style that smoothly combines fantasy, horror and comedy. And with a larger budget this time, they're able express their mind-bending stories to a greater level.Specifically, the score and cinematography are great throughout the film and exceptional at some points. Also, both Anthony Mackie and Jamie Dornan deliver fantastic performances of two best friends who are struggling with their own personal obstacles.The story itself is unique in a general sense. But within the realms of the sub-genre that it plays into, it can seem somewhat typical if you follow those types of films. However, the approach taken to portray this story is unique. For me, this separated it from other films of similar narratives and it kept me engaged with the story and the characters.",Synchronic
