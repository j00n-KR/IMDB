0,SnoopyStyle,unreasonable premises,6,16 November 2020,"Stephanie Patrick (Blake Lively) is a drug addicted prostitute in London. It's three years after losing her loving family in a plane crash. Reporter Keith Proctor tells her that the crash is the result of a terrorist bombing which was covered up by the government. She tries to shoot the bomb maker Reza but lacks the nerve to do it. She tracks down Proctor's source former MI6 agent Iain Boyd (Jude Law) who trains her to be an assassin. A person known as U-17 had ordered the plane bombing to kill one particular passenger. Iain directs her to ex-CIA officer Marc Serra (Sterling K. Brown).The setup has a lot of unreasonable premises. Not only is there a large government coverup but Proctor is the only one who is pulling it together. He's a reporter. Report it. The secret should be the person who organized the bombing, not the bombing itself. As for Jude Law, I don't understand how Blake Lively would automatically believe everything he says. Apparently, she believes everyone until the one moment when she doesn't and that's the big lie. This is naively written espionage. Then there is the la femme Nikita where a hot prostitute is trained into a cool chick assassin. I do like the swimming bit and that she's not a strength fighter. I like that her punches rarely do much unless she's punching the nuts. I am willing to say that it's more realistic than the acrobatic woman super fighting that is so prevalent today. The actors are trying but the writing is a bit weak.",The Rhythm Section
1,boblipton,"Men Want Vengeance For Their Dogs, Women For Their Families",5,9 February 2020,"Blake Lively has been dealing with the death of her family in a plane crash by dropping out of college, turning tricks and doing drugs. A reporter tells her that it was a terrorist bombing, that he has a contact in the security agencies, and also he's promptly killed by and for who knows why? Miss Lively quickly tracks down Jude Law in the highlands of Scotland, since his receding hairline had made him Hollywood's go-to actor for training dangerous women. In total, it takes him less than a year to clean her up, get her hair looking nice, and her a decent assassin so she can go out and get revenge, masquerading as an assassin Law has killed.Actually - and this is the best part in a ridiculous movie - Miss Lively is terrible at being an assassin, since she still has compunctions. Each of the killings becomes a bloody mess. So: will she figure out how to get over being a decent person I'm the evil world where spook agencies and criminals get together for big bucks? Or will she get killed by one of her victims, meaning there will be no chance to turn this into a series of movies based on a series of books.Judging by early box office returns, that's never going to happen. Here's hoping Miss Lively gets a better leading vehicle.",The Rhythm Section
2,nogodnomasters,Heart-Drums. Breathing-Bass.,4,29 February 2020,"Stephanie Patrick (Blake Lively) is working as a prostitute when she is contacted by an investigative journalist (Raza Jaffrey). Her family had all perished in a plane explosion caused by a terrorist being protected. Through a series of events, Stephanie assumes an identity and become a trained assassin going after the terrorist group. She is not Uma Thuman good and not the best and brightest assassin out there.I was pretty bored with the film. Perhaps I am spoiled by the mega-million features with black Jaguars and Audi car chases and rooftop jumping. This film didn't make it.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.",The Rhythm Section
3,classicsoncall,"""I'm not looking to get healed.""",6,24 October 2020,"I have to go along with a number of other reviewers for this flick. For Stephanie Patrick (Blake Lively) to rise to the level of an elite assassin in less than a year, even with training, is too much of a stretch to maintain credibility for the story line. Her very first assignment resulted in a rookie mistake when she had the drop on Lehmans (Richard Brake) and blew it when he faked immobility. It reminded me of all those old 'B' Westerns when the hero has the drop on the bad guy and for some reason hesitates and gets snookered. And if you stop and think about it, her next couple of targets resulted in unsuccessful attempts, but the victims were dispatched by other means she had nothing to do with. As a revenge film, the story had some merit, but inserting Elvis's 'It's Now or Never' into the soundtrack only brought additional focus on the never part. At least Stephanie's final kill was achieved up close and personal, allowing for a twist in the identity of her intermediary contact Serra (Sterling K. Brown).",The Rhythm Section
4,searchanddestroy-1,Nikita never died....But this one needs more vitamin.,5,2 March 2021,"Thanks Mr Besson, when you gave us NIKITA, more than thirty years ago. Since several years now, there are a numberless amount of films from all over the world, from Asia to US, that provides such action features starring women fighting like men. This becomes boring, unless if you give a tragic touch to the whole. ONLY there, in this case, you can say it's worth: or with a touch of bitterness. Anyway, this film is never boring on the form, only on the substance. And in the matter of revenge after a plane crash where the family died, I preferred AFTERNATH, starring Arnold, which was a total different way to tell a story, I admit and probably the best acting performance of the greatest bodybuilder of all times and former governor of California. This one is OK, but was it really necessary? The female director is gifted, no doubt, but I think she deserves far better material to go on. Although this movie remains a bit different than most recent female actioners, with a not so foreseeable ending.",The Rhythm Section

6,grantss,Has potential but squanders it,4,10 November 2020,"A drug-addicted prostitute swears revenge after her mother and sister are killed when their plane is destroyed by a terrorist bomb. She tracks down a former MI6 agent who helps her train for her mission and set out in her quest of vengeance.Disappointing. Had a fair amount of potential initially with a reasonable degree of intrigue plus the whole revenge arc was quite interesting. However, it stutters along and never gets going, somehow turning what could easily have been a thrilling, action-packed ride into something meandering and dull. Damp squib of a conclusion.I did not pick Blake Lively for an action-thriller star and my opinion of her has not changed. Admittedly the script and direction are quite flawed but she never seemed right for the part.Mediocre.",The Rhythm Section
7,view_and_review,"Rhythm is Good, Answers are Better",6,5 February 2020,"There were a lot of things to like about ""The Rhythm Section."" The musical score by Hans Zimmer was proper, the actors were good, and the storyline was decent for the most part. My only issue was the few questions I still had at movie's end.Blake Lively plays Stephanie Patrick, a young woman who lost her entire family in a plane explosion that was purported to be an accident. Out of the blue, when she's at her absolute lowest, a man named Keith Proctor (Raza Jaffrey) informs her that her family's death was not an accident and he knows who killed them. This not so subtle act set Stephanie off on a path of revenge.Her path led her to B (Jude Law), who trains her to be the killer she's going to need to be. After her eight month assassin crash course she goes out into the world to take out the people responsible for her family's death.She was less than proficient at killing and I appreciated that. For a person who's never killed before, even if she's angry, it's not a simple thing to just take a life. But even as difficult as it was for her, physically and emotionally, she still sallied forth to reach the principle actor in the bombing of her family's flight.So here are the questions:1.) Why did Proctor trust her enough to leave her at his place with a key? He just met her and he paid for that mistake with his life.2.) Why would B train her to be an assassin?3.) Why would B think that she was ready to be a contract killer after eight months of training?I have my theories with my main theory being that she was being set up from the beginning. I think B had a number of targets in mind and he couldn't get to them so he needed the help of a woman. Stephanie was the best choice because she could easily be motivated by revenge and she was expendable being that she was nothing more than a drug addicted prostitute. That's my theory and that is what would make it all make sense. Still, it's just a theory so I'm still left with questions. Had the movie been a tad clearer I think I would've liked it a lot more.",The Rhythm Section
8,ferguson-6,a franchise hopeful,5,30 January 2020,"Greetings again from the darkness. Kicking off a successful franchise that can sustain multiple sequels is the dream of most actors, writers, directors, and producers. When it clicks, a movie franchise can be a cash cow for many years. Unfortunately, it's just not that easy to create characters that viewers will invest in, or story lines that will keep those viewers interested. Author Mark Burnell has already published four books in his Stephanie Patrick series, and director Reed Morano brings the first one to the big screen. By the time the end credits roll, we have little doubt that ""franchise"" was the goal.An opening scene finds Stephanie Patrick (Blake Lively) pointing a gun at the head of a man who is unaware of her presence. A freeze frame shifts us to ""8 months earlier."" Stephanie is a mess. She is supporting her heroin addiction through prostitution, all with the objective of numbing her pain. Three years earlier, her family was killed in a plane crash. It's the kind of tragedy followed by a grief so devastating that Stephanie has basically given up on life.Stephanie is jolted back to life when a journalist informs her that it was a bomb planted by a terrorist that brought down the plane her family was on. Now, Stephanie has a reason to exist ... revenge. Clearly some suspension of disbelief is in order here. Actually everything about this story is a stretch from reality or even believability. Quick, name all of the heroin addicts who become world class assassins in 8 months. OK, that's probably not a fair question since you likely don't know many heroin addicts, and you hopefully don't know many assassins. But you get the point.The film plays like a brochure for a travel agent, as the story and Stephanie have stops in Tangier, England, Ireland, Madrid, New York, and Marseilles. Each stop is pretty brief - merely long enough for some killing. Of course most of the stops occur after former MI6 agent Ian Boyd (Jude Law) trains her on the finer points of being a contract killer. The training includes jogging uphill, a frigid lake swim, how to fight in the kitchen, how to get run off the road while driving, and the invaluable advice to shoot your victim twice (but your teacher only once). Oh yes, and she has to impersonate a presumed-dead assassin. Fortunately, Stephanie was top of her class at Oxford, so she is smart enough to make sense of all these things that make no sense to us.And another thing ... why do all these people have such perfect and complete files on their targets? Photographs by Glamour Shots, map coordinates to hideouts, and an alphabetical list of known accomplices are all quite helpful when former MI6 and former CIA agents (Sterling K Brown) are trying to get a heroin addict to do their dirty work. Brown's CIA agent turned 'information broker' is the oddest of many odd characters here. He lives in a stunning ultra-modern home and has no qualms about hitting on hot assassins that he knows only by reputation. Thanks to all those marvelously complete files, the only unknown here is the mysterious U17. Well, U17 seems to be mysterious to everyone except those watching the movie.Blake Lively is a talented actress as evidenced by her work in THE TOWN, THE SHALLOWS, and A SIMPLE FAVOR. She is simply miscast here. Despite the ""training"" her Stephanie received from Ian, we never once believe she is ready to kill all the bad guys. This contributes heavily to the lack of believability presented by the film. It's a serious story that is ultimately impossible to take seriously as a viewer.There is a difference in believable and stylish, and director Reed Morano certainly serves up style. She is known mostly for her work as a cinematographer, though she did direct the first 3 episodes of ""The Handmaid's Tale."" Ms. Morano and cinematographer Sean Bobbitt hit us with some jarring camera work, and the musical inserts are just a tad too cutesy and obvious at their given time: ""I'm Sorry"", ""It's Now or Never"", and ""Where Did You Sleep Last Night?"" (a cover by Sleigh Bells).Having author Mark Burnell adapt his own novel may have been a mistake, as there are far too many plot holes and ridiculous moments for this to work as any type of thriller. Here are three examples: we never know why Stephanie didn't get on the flight with her family; it makes little sense that the journalist tracked her down; and is that supposed to be a twist or not? Given the inclusion of Bond producers (and half-siblings) Barbara Broccoli and Michael G Wilson (stepson of Cubby Broccoli), we can safely assume that the vision was to turn Mr. Burnell's books into a franchise along the lines of James Bond and Jason Bourne - right down to the fight scenes and international settings. This film certainly sets things up for round two, and if that happens, let's hope more attention is paid to the script ... a crucial element if viewers are expected to buy in.",The Rhythm Section
9,gradyharp,"'He believes in profit...not ""the Prophet""",7,13 June 2021,"Mark Burnell transformed his novel into a screenplay: one would hope the novel was more sensitive and expletive than the rambling and somewhat disjointed screenplay. Reed Murano directs and the producers are the James Bond crew, so the foundation is solid and the film tries very hard to warrant viewership.The cast is excellent and works diligently to make each character memorable - if even just through the perplexing timeframe of the film's story! Quite simply distilled, the plot concerns a woman Stephanie Patrick (Blake Lively), addicted to drugs and working as a prostitute in a state of fragile reality as a result of the death of her family in a plane crash - a trip on which she was supposed to join with them, who discovers the plane crash was planned as she encounters the kind 'client' Keith Proctor (Raza Jeffrey). She gathers her senses and with the training of the odd ex-MI6 agent Iain Boyd (Jude Law) she becomes an assassin, committed to kill the man who planned and executed the tragic plane crash, Another 'aid' in her plan is Marc Serra (Sterling K. Brown), and despite futile attempts to assassinate the true propagator of the aerial crime, the identity of the that person is confusing to both Stephanie and the audience!Despite the incongruities of the story, the film is entertaining, allow the viewer to appreciate the performances is not the plot.

11,ThomasDrufke,Above Average January Thriller,6,4 February 2020,"Sometimes the style over substance tactic works against a film, like this year's The Gentleman for example. But for some reason, I found The Rhythm Section to be well-done, even if the film doesn't feel as complete nor as captivating as the trailer seemed to indicate. However, I continue to applaud Blake Lively, who has great taste in projects, and always takes on new and challenging roles each time out.

12,westsideschl,Exceptional & Real,9,4 May 2020,"A lot of people conditioned to super powered espionage action heroes will be disappointed w/the realism of someone making mistakes as they develop the art of tracking down the terrorists responsible for her family's deaths. But, for that realism, I applaud the script; the acting, the intelligent dialogue. Also, the cinematography, and editing for the great angles (especially the novel car chase scene). The music & sound effects were all creatively chosen, adding to the tension - well done.

13,slightlymad22,"It Has It's Moments, But Is Underwhelming",6,3 February 2020,"I just got out of Rhythm SectionThere is not much new here. We have seen this type of 'avenging my loved ones' movie countless times before, we have seen the 'training to be an assassin' a ton of times too and that is without the 'must stop the terrorist' plot thrown into the mix.Of the cast Blake Livley is ok, I suppose, but nothing special, whilst Jude Law is ok, although his jet black hair will give Steven Seagal black hair envy.This is not the action movie the trailer promised. It's somber tone and pacing problems make this pretty boring at times. Due to its plodding pace, I was certain this clocked it over 2 hours... but it's about 1 hr 45.One of my main problems was Blake Lively, I didn't care for her character, in fact I outright disliked her!! Considering she is out for revenge due to her innocent family being killed, she caused a lot of collateral damage to innocent people.Huge nitpick for me was she left her blood and finger prints at a lot of the crime scenes and it has some awful precisctable dialogue.It does have some things going for it, I like how she never actually becomes a great assassin in fact she is pretty awful (as any normal person suddenly trying to kill people would be) and there is a good scene where Jude Law trains Blame Livley in combat and it's all done in one take. For such a downbeat movie, the songs in it's soundtrack are very upbeat.There was only 3 other people in my screening and one of them walked out.",The Rhythm Section

15,cruise01,"Dull revenge thriller that lacks story, acting, and action.",5,31 January 2020,"The Rhythm Section (2.5 out of 5 stars).The Rhythm Section is an action drama that is more of a dud for a revenge type thriller that is suppose to start a series. Based on the trilogy of novels. About Stephanie (Blake Lively) who loses her family in a terrorist attack. Who goes out for revenge. Well this film fails to be worth watching with its uninspired story, boring characters, and a dull direction. Blake Lively is great playing a raw and torn up character. If you are looking for an awesome female action film I will suggest Atomic Blonde, Anna, or even Jennifer Garner's revenge flick Peppermint was even better than this.The plot lacks development and plot. The film begins with Stephanie, wasting away her life addicted to drugs and being a prostitute. A journalist discovers her and helps her with information about the terrorist attack that took away many lives including her family. She finds Iain (Jude Law) who trained her to be a skilled fighter and survivalist. Which then, he sends her on contracts to kill the terrorists that are responsible for the bombing.The plot is a bit boring for a revenge action thriller. Iain is sending Stephanie on assassin contracts. Trying to find the leader that was responsible. There is nothing worth mentioning about the story. It was lacking the emotional development building to even care about these characters.The direction is boring. The action was nothing worth talking about for those few scenes. It is kind of like an origin story with Stephanie being introduced to assassinating. She was vulnerable. She has difficulties in killing a bad guy. She does make some simple mistakes that would cost innocent peoples lives. Cause her emotions got in the way and distracted her.Blake Lively is good playing Stephanie. A raw and emotionally torn down girl. Jude Law was okay playing Iain, a former CIA who is obsessed in finding these terrorists as well. Sterling K. Brown playing a former CIA informant was just flat out one dimensional. And terrible.The fight scenes are forgettable. The brief car chase scene is boring. It had that one long take of a car chase but nothing worth mentioning.Overall, The Rhythm Section fails to launch an action series with Blake Lively. The story is boring. The direction failed with its boring action and forgettable characters.",The Rhythm Section
16,eddie_baggins,"A failed franchise starter, deserving of its bombing",1,20 May 2020,"A lifeless and charmless affair, The Rhythm Section is deserving of its dubious honor of becoming the worst ever domestic opening box office performer in the USA for a film released in 3,000 theaters or more when it was unleashed earlier in 2020.Garnering a total of just $2,715,384 when it opened on 3049 cinema screens, the long delayed project of director Reed Morano, its star Blake Lively and Bond producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson is a complete non-event, a film devoid of any type of redeeming features outside of a committed but misused performance of its leading lady, as Reed and her producer's looked to make a Jason Bourne/James Bond female-centered hybrid, that instead becomes nothing but a waste of time, money and effort.Based on author Mark Burnell's book series, Section follows down on her luck drug addled and depressed Stepahnie Patrick, a woman haunted by the tragic death of her family, who finds redemption in the thought and process of enacting out revenge on those she finds out are responsible for her families demise, in what she finds out was a hidden terrorist attack.Morano, who started her career as a cinematographer and clearly on evidence here not a storyteller, struggles to invest us into the plight of Patrick as Section fails to launch in its opening act, a struggle the film doesn't recover from, not even when Jude Law shows up as a shady trainer tasked with getting Patrick into shape to become a one woman revenge machine or when Morano finally gets some action sequences going that throw Lively into the deep end with fist fights, training montages and one take car chases.
There's not an ounce of emotional investment that is likely to be drawn out of viewers as the stories mysterious and totally unengaging plot rages on around Patrick, a plot that includes nefarious terrorists, Sterling K. Brown's blank faced ex-government operator and Lively and Law going fisticuffs in a kitchen, and its likely that before the films 100 or so minute runtime peters out you will be wishing you never went on this revenge mission.You can't help but feel for Lively throughout all of this.Trying her hardest to once and for all shake the Mrs. Ryan Reynolds tag and the stigma associated with her rise to fame in Gossip Girl, Lively goes all in physically and mentally here but her performance is let down by poor writing, shocking direction and a lack of character likability, making her committed turn one that was for naught in an experience that is deserving of its lack of notice in the film world.Final Say -Dull, boorish and without purpose, The Rhythm Section is an extremely poor attempt at launching a new thriller franchise, a franchise that is D.O.A here thanks to inexcusably bad direction and a lack of creativity and imagination.1/2 an icy-cold swim out of 5",The Rhythm Section

But now he has made a suspensefull (dramatic) thriller, with true to life characters I can believe in. I need believable characters to really get into a movie, any movie. And this movie has got just that. Great!More good: Great actors. Really great. Jude Law and Blake Lively are top of the bill. Excellent acting performances, really good! What more could I wish for? A believable story is what I need as well. The story did sound a bit ridiculous when I read it. Even when I saw the trailer I did think ""naah, too unlikely"", BUT when watching this movie, I had no problems anymore with the credibility.The photography and soundtrack (Hans Zimmer) are gorgeous, those are 2 things I really appreciate and those technical qualities are a sign a lot of attention for detail went into this movie.Any bad? Well if you dont like female empowered characters, this movie might not be for you. Lately several good (and many mediocre) female empowered action movies have been released. This one is definitely one of the best.BEWARE, this movie has got quite a grungy, bleak look and feel. It's gritty. Dark. Even somewhat depressing. The leading character is a down and out prostitute, totally wasted mentally, excellently played by Blake Lively. Some might not like this gritty, bleak feel.Mind you, this is NOT a regular nonstop action movie, although it is wrongly presented that way in the trailer, but it isnt. What I mean to say is that this is firstmost a character driven suspenseful movie and not an action movie, although there are a few terrific action scenes that are of the same high quality as in The Bourne series with Matt Damon. There is much more suspense and drama in this movie though than there is action, just so you know what to expect....I dont understand why this movie has skipped beneath the radar and hasnt gotten a higher rating.

19,paul-allaer,A complete flop on every level,3,2 February 2020,"""The Rhythm Section"" (2020 release; 109 min.) brings the story of Stephanie. As the movie opens, we are in ""Tangiers"" and Stephanie has carefully entered a house and confronts a guy with her gun. We then go to ""8 Months Earlier, London"", where Stephanie is approached by a freelance journalist who claims to know what happened to the flight that crashed 3 years ago, killing all 239 people on board, including Stephanie's parents and siblings. After initially rebuking the journalist's approach, Stephanie changes her mind and decides to listen to him... At this point we are 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest film from cinematographer-director Reed Morano (she is best known for her work on the ""Billions"" and ""The Handmade's Tale"" TV series). Here she brings Mark Burnell's novel of the same name to the big screen. I haven't read the novel, so I cannot comments on how closely the move sticks to the book. What I can tell you is that the movie is a flop on every imaginable level. And this is not for a lack of trying. In fact the movie clearly sports a big budget, including multiple locations (London, Inverness, Surrey, Madrid, Tangiers). But two specific things sink the movie: first the script is incredibly weak, with a plot that makes no sense and/or has holes in it the size of Manhattan. At some point early on, Stephanie (played by Blake Lively goes to Inverness, where she encounters Ian (played by Jude Law). I'm sorry, but who is Ian? I was never able to figure that out. And the dialogue isn't much better. ""How would you provide closure?"" someone asks Stephanie. ""Violently"", she responds. What?!? Second factor sinking the movie: much of the movie features extreme close-ups AND hand-held camera work, which makes for a headache-inducing cocktail. I feel sorry for the cast. Blake Lively, otherwise such a strong performer, tries the make the best of a terrible situation, but she simply looks lost (besides being twitchy a lot). Jude Law appears and then disappears.""The Rhythm Section"" opened wide this weekend, and based upon the intriguing-looking trailer, and of course being a fan of Lively and Law, I couldn't wait to see it. The Sunday matinee screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended dismally (exactly 2 people, including myself), and it appears the rest of the country didn't care much for this either, as the movie completely bombed at the box office ($2.8 mill., the worst opening weekend ever for a movie on 3,000+ screens). I honestly cannot recommend this movie in good conscience to anyone, but of course I'd readily suggest you check this out, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",The Rhythm Section
20,subxerogravity,Good action movie.,6,31 January 2020,"Some what like Point of No Return, Blake Lively gets to play an unlikely action hero and pulls it off quite well.

21,jtindahouse,The book's author should've handed the reins to a screenwriter,4,9 April 2020,"I'm always a little skeptical when I see that a book's author has adapted his own screenplay. There are a couple of reasons for this. First of all a screenplay has to be very different to a novel for a number of obvious reasons. Novels are about filling the void with endless details and painting a picture in people's minds using as many words as you can. Where as in a film the rule is show, don't tell. Meaning things should speak for themselves. This film has a lot of over-explaining and unnecessary dialogue. Secondly, authors get too attached to the material they've written in the book and want to force it into the film. This film wasn't too bad in that respect, although I would've killed for them to cut 20 minutes off the runtime so I didn't have to watch it.The movie sets up a premise, and we the audience feel like we should care, but the movie just makes it so hard to by being incredibly bland and uninteresting. It's like, okay this girl has a really interesting back-story and a good genuine reason to want some payback, so why do I not give a hoot? The characters feel like book characters. They are more interested in getting information out there, than actually being interesting to listen to and watch. The film also has almost zero humour and any that it does attempt is never funny.This was not the right type of role for Blake Lively. She has her looks going for her usually, but even that they took away from her in this film. She was extremely bland to watch and completely unrealistic in the action/fight sequences she's supposedly dominating. This film flopped extremely hard at the box office and it's not hard to imagine why. A terrible title, extremely bland trailers, no interesting actors and certainly no good word of mouth.

Blake Lively does give her all of a performance, showing that she was a woman who has been roughed up in years, but her british accent seems to slip between scenes. Jude Law is also has Livelys tough guy mentor. Action scenes are okay nothing really special. Also has a few good suspenceful moments. What brought the film down for me, is the lighting was too dark, to the point I didn't know what was going on have the time, and also too many close ups to the point I started feeling claustrphobic. That is what brought the movie down for me.",The Rhythm Section
23,stevendbeard,I Was Disappointed,6,1 February 2020,"I saw ""The Rhythm Section"", starring Blake Lively-The Shallows, Green Lantern; Jude Law-Captain Marvel, Spy; Sterling K. Brown-This Is Us_tv, Black Panther and Raza Jaffrey-Homeland_tv, Eastern Promises.
This movie is based on the first novel in the Stephanie Patrick series written by Mark Burnell, who also wrote the screenplay for this movie. One of the producers is Barbara Broccoli of James Bond fame and me being a big James Bond fan, I was really excited to see this movie. But I must say, I was a little disappointed. It's not a bad movie, it's just not what I was expecting-it is a little slow at times. Blake plays an ordinary woman that spirals into depression after loosing her family in a plane crash. She starts doing drugs and soliciting strangers for money with promises of sex-some people call that prostitution. Anyway, things change when Raza shows up as a 'John' but he doesn't want sex. Instead, he tells her that he is a reporter and has evidence that the plane crash that killed her family was the result of a terrorist bombing. Blake wants revenge and finds Jude-an ex MI6 agent-to help her. He trains her and connects her with Sterling-an ex C.I.A. agent-that is now an information broker that has leads to the person behind the bombing. Even with Jude's training, Blake is no Bond. She messes up on more than one occasion-which tends to make her more believable-so maybe she gets better if there are any sequels.
It's rated ""R"" for violence, language, drug use and sexual content-no nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 49 minutes.
It was good but kind of slow, so I don't think I would buy it on DVD. It would be alright as a rental.",The Rhythm Section
24,robfollower,The Rhythm Section Review 6.5/10,6,31 January 2020,"After her family died in an airplane crash, Stephanie Patrick (Blake Lively) becomes inconsolable and her life goes quickly off the rails. However, when she's informed that the crash wasn't a crash but a bombing, she sets off on a path of revenge that leads her to be trained by an ex-MI6 agent (Jude Law) to kill those responsible... Although 'The Rhythm Section' has the credentials of a Bond movie - it's about spies, it's set in exotic locations, it's by EON Productions - it's far closer to an arthouse effort than a big-budget blockbuster. In fact, drafting in Reed Morano - who's made her career in stylish TV shows like 'The Handmaid's Tale', 'Halt and Catch Fire' and 'Billions' - speaks to an attempt to create something that's far more considered than just plain old explosions and gadgets.On the surface, 'The Rhythm Section' has everything going for it. Blake Lively in a serious, meaty role with an upcoming director, in a genre that's crying out for new perspectives - but the problem with it is that you've pretty much seen it all before. Compared to something like 'Atomic Blonde', there's something much different going on, but it's not helped by the lack of flow to it and the humdrum script and plot.It's a shame, as Blake Lively is trying her hardest to make it work and Reed Morano is absolutely a director worth watching. Sadly, Mark Burnell's script and plotting is far too clumsy and clunky to be helped, and doesn't always hit the mark where it should. Still, how Morano handles the action is fascinating and how Lively plays it is rich and authentic. There are no big, sweeping action setpieces and the fight sequences are messy, bloody affairs and done with little flourish - but that helps to make it all the more convincing.The supporting cast, made up of the likes of Jude Law, Sterling K. Brown, Raza Jaffrey, all do their work well, but it's Lively's show and she's more than capable of carrying the story. Sadly, that story's a little bit too hokey and flat for it to be anything other than just OK. The female-assassin trope is well-trodden, and in recent years, the likes of 'Killing Eve' have given it a fresh perspective. 'The Rhythm Section' has that behind and in front of the camera, but on the page and in the script, it's kind of a let down.

25,alindsay-al,A Below Average by the numbers action film,4,20 August 2020,"So this film came out earlier this year and I missed it but now I have had the chance to watch The Rhythm Section and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees a woman seeking revenge against people who orchestrated a plane crash that killed her family.Main Character
Blake Lively plays the lead character here and she is fine. She does a decent job in the action sequences and there were times were you felt for her character, but there just isn't enough there. You don't learn enough about her character to really care and there is nothing particularly interesting about her as our lead character here.Supporting Characters
Jude Law plays her mentor in the film and I thought he did a good job here, the best part of this film is easily watching Law train Lively and he plays the role well. But like Lively I thought there was more that could have been done with his character but this film just doesn't have the time or effort to go through with it. Sterling K Brown is a good actor but I have no idea what his character was about here, he is a pretty charismatic guy but that is not on display here and it just feels like he is wasted and a bit bland. The rest of the cast doesn't have anything to offer really and just feel like people for Lively to go after.Story
The story is good when it shows the training element. I like how Law and lively interact and seeing the training is interesting and the best part of the film. But my god this story is convoluted and it is hard to follow, again the fact that you don't care about Lively makes it difficult for you to get emotionally invested and care about the emotionally hitting parts of the film. Also the end of the film feels really rushed, it seems to breeze by and by the time you can take stock on what has happened the film is over.Script
The script is really dull, there is nothing stand out about it at all. The dialogue is bland, there is no humour and the drama doesn't do enough to get you invested in the characters or the plot, which as mentioned is written poorly and makes it hard to follow.Style
The style has some decent action scenes in it, one in particular is really good and it is just a shame the rest can't stand up to it. It is just a shame that with action films such as John Wick and Extraction with fantastic action this is just another by the numbers action film that has nothing that stands out. Also the pacing of the film isn't great, as I said before the ending feels really rushed and didn't work for me.Overall
Overall, this is a below average action film that don't stand out. I honestly feel like this film would have been better as a TV series but unfortunately it is a by the numbers dull film that isn't worth watching.",The Rhythm Section
26,henry8-3,The Rhythm Section,5,29 November 2020,"A prostitute and drug addict (Lively) discovers her family's deaths 3 years earlier were caused by terrorists. Following a trail to ex MI6 agent - Jude Law - she learns from him the skills which will enable her to take her revenge.This certainly has a terrific central performance from Lively and the action sequences are tough and realistically believable. The sum of its parts though only create a solid rather than good, original thriller. The predictable, derivative last few moments of the film are also rather irritating and unnecessary.",The Rhythm Section

31,kirbylee70-599-526179,SLOW REVENGE MOVIE,7,6 June 2020,"To promote the new movie the company behind THE RHYTHM SECTION constantly make note that it comes from the producers of the James Bond films. The fact that there is plenty of violence in the film as well as ties to MI6 shouldn't mislead folks into thinking this is a high tech spy film though. In fact it's more of a revenge film.Stephanie Patrick (Blake Lively) is a young woman whose family is killed in a plane explosion as it is flying out of London. Three years later she's still living there working as a prostitute and strung out on drugs. One days she is approached by Keith Proctor (Raza Jeffrey), a journalist investigating the crash who informs her it wasn't an accident but a bombing planned by terrorists.At first not believing him she eventually finds him and visits him, seeing all of the information he has gathered thus far. The man behind the bombing was named Reza, now living as a student in London and left alone by the government as well as MI6. It seems they feel he is more valuable to them as a source to track down those responsible rather than taking him down.Pawning off what she can Stephanie buys more drugs and a gun with the intention of killing Reza. When she confronts him in a diner she can't bring herself to follow through. She heads to Proctor's apartment to let him know what happened only to find him dead. With a small lead as to his main source, she sets out to find the man with the information to help her plot Reza's death.Heading to a remote location in Scotland she finds ""B"", Iain Boyd (Jude Law), an ex-MI6 agent who was Proctor's source for information. B informs her that it was her ineptitude that led to the death of Proctor. He also lets her know that the man behind it all is the elusive radical terrorists known only as U-17. Begging him to help her, to train her, letting him know that her life is now meaningless, he reluctantly agrees and the training begins.It's difficult and at first he isn't sure if she'll make it or not. Through sheer determination she does and the plan begins to take form. B tells her that the body of a professional assassin he killed, Petra Reuter, is still missing and they plan on her taking Petra's place. Using her as a pawn in the game of cat and mouse with the terrorists puts her life in jeopardy but she's determined to avenge the death of her family.Boyd puts her in touch with Marc Serra (Sterling K. Brown), an ex-CIA agent and information broker, to gain information that will lead her to U-17. Unable and unwilling to fund her search, she approaches the father of liberal Muslim reformer Abdul Kaif. Kaif was the target of the bombing with everyone else considered collateral damage. He refuses but when his wife overhears, she agrees to fund her mission. In return Stephanie/Petra gives her her wedding ring to hold as collateral.With funding in place she returns to talk to Serra to gain information and begins tracking down the various members of the terrorists' organization behind the bombing. With each person killed she comes closer to finding the identity of U-17 as well as losing herself in the murders she commits. Along the way she gets help from Boyd when she fails to follow through.But as is often the case things are not always what they seem. As the bodies begin to pile up Stephanie learns move about everyone from Boyd to Reza to Serra to U-17. The puzzle unravels slowly and the eventual outcome is not as predictable as you would expect.As I said don't go in expecting this to be a Bond film. Yes, there are car chases. Yes, there are explosions. Yes, there is gunplay and people die. But that's about it. With the exception of taking a novice off the street and turning her into a killing machine this film is more based in the real world, one where the leader of a terrorist group is more likely to hide his identity than announce it.Lively does a fantastic job here and it's a surprise that she isn't getting more high profile acting assignments. She does a believable job here changing not just in attitude but in look as well. Law does a fine job too in the role of mentor.The movie's only fault lies in the pacing. The first 30 minutes are grueling and take forever to get through. I understand it's setting things up but it could move faster. The rest of the movie doesn't pick up the pace much more but at least it includes a few action scenes. On the whole the movie is entertaining but look for a story with more depth than you'd expect and you'll get more from it.",The Rhythm Section
32,Pairic,Average thriller,6,6 February 2020,"The Rhythm Section: Yet another film about the creation of a female assassin. Blake Lively is down, a heroin addict, in a brothel. She had lost her family in an air crash three years ago, has survivors guilt. A reporter tells her that the plane was bombed, she acts like a junkie will, getting the reporter killed. She tracks down the reporters ex-MI6 contact, Jude Law. Eventually he puts her through cold turkey and trains her up as an assassin. But she's not finely honed, as she seeks out those responsible for the bombing it won't be easy.Average spy/terrorist/assassin thriller. Lively's back story doesn't totally convince, she was from a middle-class background, there was a house, likely life insurance, money, payouts from airline for loss of four family members. Difficult even for a new addict to blow that much money and fall so low in three years. Law is gruff as the trainer but again, would he see a junkie ex-student as a potential assassin?Things get more realistic when Lively goes into the field. Killing people close up isn't that easy. She hasn't got iron nerves or ultra-quick reflexies but does have enough drive and resolve to continue. Here the fragile but determined Lively is more convincing. Secrets are uncovered and there is perhaps one plot twist too many as the film wends it's way to the climax. Directed by Reed Morano, written by Mark Burnell (from his novel). 6/10.",The Rhythm Section
33,masonfisk,LEARN FROM WHAT WORKED BEFORE...!,4,11 February 2020,"Blake Lively's latest is a problematic retread of La Femme Nikita as we follow the surviving member of a British family (they've been killed in a plane crash) as she seeks justice (a reporter informs her the initial report of the plane's accidental crash was actually the work of a terrorist) for their deaths. Thinking she can conduct her wave of revenge on her own backfires nearly immediately when she tracks down the bomb maker only to freeze up when she can't pull the trigger which causes her prey to track down the journalist (Lively gleaned information from his copious notes of the nasty deed) killing him. Using whatever info she can find, she then meets up w/the journo's ex-MI6 contact, played by Jude Law, who's holed up in a remote location in Scotland. He agrees to train her & when he feels she's ready she adopts the persona of an assassin (Law killed her some years before) so she can infiltrate various locales & do away w/the surviving members of the cadre behind the bombing. Along the way she meets up w/an ex-CIA information peddler, played by Sterling K. Brown, who gets her closer to her goals but for the most part whenever something goes swimmingly for her it's usually by luck or some stroke of chance then by the rigorous instruction imparted on her. Wanting to have it both ways is never going to engender an audience's sympathies w/our heroine's plight since in this kind of story the moral ambiguities are usually front & center & never this mewling. Lively, who has carved out a nice niche for herself by picking projects which work to her strengths (like A Simple Favor or the Age of Adaline), seems to be at odds on what type of film this wants to be & as is the cliche about shooting the target you aim at, this film's sights are definitely off.",The Rhythm Section

What's really idiotic and unbelievable about all this too, is her ad hoc handler actually decides to place her in the role to start with.What also did not work for me is this film takes over half its length to get off the ground. It hits the ground shambling, like its lead character, wandering around aimlessly for far, far too long.On the upside the cast do hand in decent performances and the action when it finally arrives is reasonable, if unremarkable.5/10 from me.",The Rhythm Section
35,aidanratesmovies,An Incredibly Messy Disaster,1,24 August 2020,"Incredibly incoherent, tedious, and by all means boring- The Rhythm Section is by far one of the most strangely made and slow paced films I have ever seen, even despite Lively shining in the lead role. Before I get to all the flaws this film has, i'll begin with the positives. Blake Lively is very good in her role, and though she doesn't have much to work with, you truly feel her embracing the character as best as she can, and giving the role all she has. Jude Law doesn't have nearly as much time to shine throughout the film, but as always, he provides a solid performance and the two make for the only somewhat decent parts the film has to offer. Simply stated, this film is an absolute dumpster fire of a mess. It is very poorly edited, poor directed, and absolutely incoherent. It's a slow burn through and through, with almost no redemption to be had throughout besides Lively and some pretty shots. That isn't to say its cinematography is great either, as its action, once it finally gets to it, is absolutely loaded with shaky camera shots as far as the eye can see. It can be incredibly frustrating to watch, as you have no idea what is unfolding and why, as well as incredibly tedious as you watch the same bland crap happen over and over again until it finally comes to an end. The Rhythm Section is an editing disaster, and I hope Hollywood can find some more capable hands in the future to make such a complex narrative, instead of completely ignoring what it has throughout its entire runtime.

36,questl-18592,The Rhythm-less Section,5,13 February 2020,"This film is inappropriately named. It has next to nothing to do with any sort of rhythm or music at all. It's the story of a woman seeking vengeance on those that did her wrong and her journey to becoming an agent of vengeance.To its credit, this is Blake Lively like I've not seen her before and she's good at it. Jude Law is also good in this and I seemingly always enjoy Sterling K Brown. So the acting is good, the story is basic but it works well enough. Some of the action is even decently shot.I really want to see Edgar Wright's version of this film, something that actually makes rhythm a part of it and injects some much needed style. Instead, there's this bland and kinda boring affair with an absolutely wretched chase in the middle.That's the biggest issue. This movie is just perfectly average and it felt like it could have been so much more. It's not worth the theater trip, this is definitely a wait to see it for free type of thing, unless your a huge fan of Blake Lively.",The Rhythm Section

Seeking revenge, she tracks down a former MI6 agent who helps her train for her mission and set out in her quest of vengeance.The reviews and ratings are bad for this film .It's probably because of the cliched beginning with the drugs and prostitution but I actually enjoyed this film .Blake Lively is good and who doesn't like Jude Law . The whole story has the feel of a TV episode of something like Spooks but it's was definitely entertaining none the less.You could pick holes it the plot all day long but why bother ?It's meant as a bit of fun and it's worked for me.The last third does fizzle out when when Sterling K Brown is on screen but that's more down to the writing than his acting .100 minutes of good action .",The Rhythm Section

If that's the kind of spy thriller you desire this movie is going to be for you.

While not awful, the movie still did not meet the surprise I really wanted leading to this movie being mediocre for this reviewer.

39,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of The Rhythm Section,7,28 April 2020,"""Think of your heart as the drums, your breathing as the bass"". That's a quote from 2020's The Rhythm Section. Get it? ""Rhythm"" trades instruments for knives and guns with hollow point rounds. The ""tempo"" demonstrated here is mostly palatable.Anyway, The Rhythm Section is vastly underrated and kinda overrated at the same time. Many a spy/revenge thriller have come before it. Oh well. ""Rhythm"" has sloppy yet effective action scenes that come in fits and starts. The dialogue that emerges from the actors mouths is confidently pithy and that's a good thing.Sadly slotted into a January release and directed by a lady who has mostly been a cinematographer (Reed Morano), The Rhythm Section is about a woman who seeks vengeance for some terrorists who killed her parents in a past plane crash. Blake Lively plays said woman (Stephanie Patrick) and Jude Law (Iain Boyd) plays the ex-M16 agent who trains her to be an executive killer.Law and Lively give solid performances that heighten the almost a la mode material. Law channels his inner badass while Lively digs deep into character with nerve endings manifested. Normally elegant-looking and bright-eyed, Blake Lively appears a little weathered in ""Rhythm"". I'm not kidding. Her persona was once a drug addict and a prostitute so the phrase, ""you look just like I feel"" gets a whole new meaning.Reflecting on The Rhythm Section, I was reminded of a more ratty Bourne Identity coupled with a modern-day version of 2005's Munich. In truth, ""Rhythm"" is a slow burn, globetrotter of a film with the occasional burst of extremity and a raw, in-your-face car chase that needs to be seen to be believed. Bottom line: This ""rhythm ain't gonna totally get you"" but there are much worse ways to spend over a hundred minutes. Rating: 3 stars.",The Rhythm Section

In fact, very action packed & fast paced. Except it's not. It's dreary & plodding. It's slow, dry & pretty flat for the most part. Even the action scenes which do happen aren't all that or a only great for a very short time before ending.The fight scenes were alright, as were the action scene like the explosions.

43,rivertam26,Overly mediocre,5,6 February 2020,"It's not a bad movie but as soon as it starts it's all just too familiar. I mean we've seen this film so many times so you ask yourself what new stuff is this going to bring to the table. The answer, nothing really. Blake Lively is solid as always and does amazingly with what little she's handed. But she's really the only positive thing besides a few immersive action setpieces and some intriguing cinematography. The movie feels jumbled and a bit confusing and never really finds it's way. Its supposed to be a hyper realistic revenge tale but as it moves from scene to scene the plot looses focus and it's hard to know what the actual guiding direction is. At the base it's about a young woman whose family is killed on a flight because of a terrorist attack. She of course stupidly becomes a prostitute and drug addict even though she's top of her class at a prestigious college. She's contacted by someone investigating the incident which leads her to become an assassin and trains with a dominant and sexy Jude Law. Now that I'm regurgitating the plot I realize how dumb it is. The gorgeous and very talented Blake Lively looks like garbage in the movie and intentionally so but it feels a bit frustrating at times and the movie feels a tad bit uncomfortable and misogynistic at certain moments. All in all it's a bit confused but is decently entertaining. Despite some pacing issues the action sequences are engaging and the last one on a bus is edge of your seat. Overall it's all just overly mediocre",The Rhythm Section

""Stephanie"" is the featured hitwoman here, but one could argue that her kill count rises to only one by the time the final gong marches her off THE RHYTHM SECTION's center stage. Though Stephanie winds up with enough ""expense money"" to obtain as many sniper rifles, military assault-style long guns, untraceable ""ghost guns,"" one-use plastic 3D printer firearms and futuristic shoot-around-corners heat, she insists upon slumming around bearing the sort of knives, bombs and lethal injectors with which no self-respecting hit person would be caught dead.

Whether it's a too-long car chase or the trauma of causing ""collateral damage"" (when her New York City john's two young kids are blown up with him by the ""Plan B"" car bomb after Stephanie gets cold feet about slitting his throat while the couple's in the buff), THE RHYTHM SECTION taps out a steady S.O.S. plea for more gats.

46,baumer,Lots to like but a little confusing,8,25 March 2021,"The rhythm section is based on a book by writer Mark Burnell. Something tells me that the book would explain things a lot better than the movie does. Here's a story with international conspiracy theories, cia, MI6 and all kinds of different terrorist factions all in the same story. At the heart of the film is Stephanie Patrick and the loss of her family. They were on a flight that supposedly crashed over the ocean. When in reality there was a bomb placed on that plane and it blew up in mid-flight killing all the passengers. Stephanie was supposed to be on that flight with her family including her parents but for one reason or another she decided not to fly with them.Stephanie is an ordinary person who gets involved in a world full of espionage and terrorism. There's a lot to like about the film but as I mentioned in the title it's also a bit confusing especially at the end when it supposedly all comes together.I read a lot of reviews in here and for those who hate the movie they hate the fact that Stephanie is kind of useless. She gets trained to go into the field by a former MI6 agent played by Jude law. He teaches her to shoot a gun, hand-to-hand combat and other skills she's going to need to get into the nefarious world she's about to enter. But she's still a normal human being and 8 months of training is not going to make her a super assassin. If you're looking for a movie that is similar to Jennifer Garner's Peppermint, this one is kind of the complete opposite.And I think that's the reason why I did enjoy this. Blake lively play Stephanie as someone who is hell-bent on revenge. All she thinks about is avenging her family's death. But she is not a spy, she is not an agent and she is no more ready for what she's about to do than you and I would be. And that's the refreshing part about it. When she gets in way over her head she has to use a lot more than just what she's been taught to survive.Lively is the heart and soul of the movie and she gives a terrific performance. Jude law also gives a fantastic interpretation of a villified and ostracized former MI6 agent. He doesn't care for Stephanie at first but they share a common goal and their chemistry together is one of the fun parts of the film.I enjoyed the rhythm section. It's not as slick and fast moving as something like peppermint or atomic blonde but it does allow us to get inside of Stephanie's world and I like being a part of that.8/10",The Rhythm Section
47,muamba_eats_toast,Build and builds without particularly exploding,6,6 February 2020,The film builds really well and had me hooked in but it appeared to just continue to do that.

I can't help feeling however that it was a little anti-climatic in the end.,The Rhythm Section
48,drjgardner,Nothing exceptional,5,1 February 2020,"There isn't anything special about the film. The acting is borderline OK and the photography is good. The direction is a little slow and there really are few tense scenes, when they should have been. The story itself is probably more realistic as the newly trained assassin does a poor job in everything she attempts. I thought there was way too much time at the beginning of the film and not enough action (tension) during the action scenes.",The Rhythm Section
49,sergelamarche,Different strikes,6,8 May 2021,Far fetched story where spies talk as if they know or guess right but few evidences support what they assert. Less credibly than mafia killers even.

50,rockman182,The Rhythm Section (2020),6,2 February 2020,"Here is a film that was indecisive about when it needed to be released. It was pushed back twice before finally releasing at the end of January. I was very critical of Blake Lively's acting in Gossip Girl and at points in her film career. It wasn't until I saw her in The Shallows that I really started to appreciate her talents. The Rhythm Section is a perfect vehicle for Lively to show her strongest performance to date but unfortunately the film is a very dull affair.
The film is about a woman who has turned to drugs and prostitution after the tragic death of her family in a plane crash three years earlier. However, one day she receives some information that suggests that the plane crash was no accident but a terrorist attack. She gets trained and learns information about those responsible for her family's death and she seeks revenge on them. The film also stars Jude Law and Sterling K. Brown.I will start with the positives. This is very easily, Blake's best performance to date. She's very good in it. She's a trained assassin but flawed as shes prone to error. That's sort of how it should be though, no? There a few scenes mostly when shes chased in a car that are shot quite well and keep you engaged. Unfortunately, that engagement does not last long. This film is very boring and feels basic for a large amount of time. When its lifeless, its hard to really stay invested in the story, especially when it feels like not much goes on for a bulk of the film.
The film hits ""Action thriller led by a female lead"" cliches as we go along. I can see what the filmmaker was going for but unfortunately there isn't enough action or entertainment to really get viewers hearts racing. The studio was unsure what to do with this film and it turns out it will be just an after thought as soon as you leave the theater. Just a very unremarkable film.5.5/10",The Rhythm Section

52,Horror_Flick_Fanatic,Good action thriller,8,7 September 2020,This film is a pretty good action thriller. I am a little surprised by the low ratings on IMDB. Both Blake Lively and Jude Law really belt out great performances. Funny thing is I never thought of Blake Lively as an action actor before. This film was a refreshing view on her career.The film isn't perfect but few action films are. I didn't quite understand how the terrorists found the journalist simply because they stole her bag. At first I thought perhaps they grabbed her mobile from the bag and trace back the GPS data. But she had possession of her mobile so that couldn't be it. Unless they were aware of the journalist investigative work and found his business card in her bag. That might have been what led them to the reporter.,The Rhythm Section

swim a lake,
learn to fire a gun and breathe at the same time.The revenge story used once more and this film reminded me of 'American Assassin' where an average person (or in this case a drug using prostitute) decide to get revenge for the death of their whoever.At least with 'American Assassin' the espionage was intriguing but with the silly little film I did wonder why?Don't get me wrong, okay film but I was shaking my head at the screen wondering how the terrorists always missed!Couldn't really recommend this as there are far better films to see in this same genre.Rating 5 out of 10",The Rhythm Section
54,jrarichards,"slightly frustrating roller-coaster of bad, good, bad, good and bad again",6,25 August 2020,"Reed Morano's film in some weird sense continues where ""The Shallows"" leaves off in showing a strained, pained, suffering and at times even pretty ugly version of star Blake Lively, otherwise renowned for her good looks. Lively clearly wants to emphasise (once again!) her credentials as a true actress, and frankly (once again) she does well enough, IMHO. Certainly we get several transformations of appearance and personality that are dramatic and hard not to be impressed by.A bigger issue is with the film itself, which does not look cohesive as it chops and changes, is nevertheless NOT entirely without virtue, but does not seem quite sure what effect it wants to achieve.The first point here is that I was very much inclined to delete this whole thing within the first couple of minutes, because it did not seem really to be going anywhere Yet a few minutes further in it was completely clear that such drastic action would have been a mistake. Hence the first message is to not give up to quickly here, just in case - as it remains possible to regret that decision.In essence, the early scenes - dragged out as they may be - ARE worthwhile, and perhaps the main message of the film (or at least they SHOULD be). Paying some kind of homage to - for example - the ""9/11 families"", we see how utterly blighted survivors' and relatives' lives may be when they have lost others to wanton acts of terrorism with not fully explained circumstances. The degree to which Lively's British (!) character Stephanie is brought low by a catastrophe that ensued because the other members of the family made an adjustment for her - and she did not take the opportunity anyway - is telling.Tack on to that a further early part about a journalist's quest as to how it could be possible that the truth of the event being terrorism has been suppressed, and you then have further worthwhile (not entirely irrelevant-looking) conspiracy-theory comment. Unfortunately, then, this part of the film comes to an abrupt (dead) stop, before we head off in another direction (actually quite literally as London makes way for the Scottish Highlands (though it's in fact Ireland, but still pretty and inspiring)).Already, things are beginning to trivialise, but all hope is not yet lost... For this part of the film also has a measure of worth, as it sees an espionage veteran (played by Jude Law) train Stephanie up, having first got her back on her feet from drug addiction and general malaise. While it looks implausible, it has to be admitted that spy recruitment from the best universities among people with no family connections and little to lose is not an unknown phenomenon out here in the real world! A poignant bit here is how Stephanie is a beautiful young woman so troubled by the events that have blighted her life, and so gone off the rails, that she needs to be loved perhaps more than anyone, but cannot find that. It's touching. But it's not something Jude Law's character chooses to do anything about, in a perhaps unlikely and paradoxical fashion.After that, the movie has a number of other fine (occasionally quite gorgeous) locations, but has by then taken a James Bondish turn in other senses too. It never really recovers from that, and a kind of nadir is reached in a car chase not necessarily needed and certainly out of synch with the first half hour of the movie. Admittedly, even in this section we do learn a tiny bit about the perils of being a contract killer, and - just occasionally - Stephanie's dilemmas (and the inability to make the kill in one place at least) do somehow ring a little true. Mercy is thankfully a powerful force (even in someone yearning for revenge), though a true professional killer may not need to be troubled by it.Frankly, by this stage the movie has gone over into implausibility and does not satisfy very well ... and more to the point it is now so far from the original mood of the piece, that I personally found myself wishing for the return of what we had had earlier, which had a bit more subtlety and general merit to it.So, yes, someone who had lost their family to terrorism might suffer a great deal, might be minded to get revenge, might even achieve that revenge. But to do that by first training long and hard to become an assassin looks like one step too far into the unlikely or downright daft-looking.",The Rhythm Section
55,abisio,"Boring, unoriginal and poorly acted. The worst movie of the year so far",1,3 February 2020,"If you want a brief advice. Run out do not pay a ticket nor lose your time to see this. Read above is the most boring action movie I had ever see; and I see a lot of crap.
Do you want to know more; well let's start for the beginning.
This is a very poorly attempt to remake La Femme Nikita. A movie I loved but it should had been some kind of great masterpiece because I saw many attempts over the years (this the four since 2018 I found) to remake and all (even on by its own creator Luc Besson) pretty unsuccessful.
Stefanie is a drug addict prostitute whose parents and sister were kill in a plane accident. A whistleblower contact her and inform that it was no accident but terrorist attempt and a big cover up. She got trained to claim vengeance and kill the bad guys. Very politically correct.Well Nikita in the movie was drug addict and perhaps a prostitute but not a saint. She kills a cop in the first scene and her victims are never referred as criminals more than political assassinations. Nikita kills until find out she will be the next victim and run away. Luc Besson made an updated version calle ANNA which is not as good as the original but has better action and acting than The Rhythm Section. It was more about espionage but if you want another on vengeance look for PEPPERMINT which is more violent and far better acted than the other two.Regarding the acting; Blake Lively is usually good; but not here. She spent most of the movie in a catatonic face and looking like a carbon copy of Anne Parillaud and the other part looking as constipated. Jude Law does a routinary good work as well as Sterling K. Brown. On top of that Blake and Jude talk in a kind of forced Cockney accent that makes their dialogs quit difficult to understand.The plot lacks any originality or development. After about one hour where very little happens aside for the constipated Blake's face quitting Heroin with a couple of nights of sleep and learning run, swim or shoot in a few days.When after the ""training"" the ""action"" starts but is so absurdly orchestrated that makes even less sense. Spoiler here:Stefanie / Blake is unable to kill unless is in self defense so she has to fight with each victim until kill it.In brief; this is the kind of B movie that usually do not get a theatrical release.; do not misuse your money or your time on this crap",The Rhythm Section
56,kjproulx,A Boring and Sloppy Film that had Promise,3,16 April 2020,"It's very disappointing when a movie with great talent in front and behind the camera ends up being underwhelming. In the case of this year's The Rhythm Section, it fits that description perfectly. This movie seemed promising to me from its trailers, so I was quite surprised about how I felt after watching it. While there is a lot of good hidden somewhere under the surface, here's why I feel this absolutely misses the mark and why I just can't recommend it to anyone.Following Stephanie Patrick (Blake Lively) after a plane crash killed her entire family, she discovers that it was a planned event and seeks out a man that will help her track down the criminals responsible. While that premise can lend itself to a very exciting film, The Rhythm Section is an example of how you can also completely miss the mark. Focussing too heavily on being dramatic and character-driven, this movie feels like an eternity to sit through. The pacing is horrible and the main character, even though well-performed by Lively, is just plain boring. This is the type of character that can win you an Oscar if written well enough, but everything about this movie felt under-developed.After the first act, Stephanie joins up with Iain Boyd (Jude Law), who helps her get into fighting shape. The problem is that the film itself is so convoluted that it becomes questionable as to how she even knows where to go in order to find him. On top of that, there's a character by the name of Mark Serra (Sterling K. Brown) who's introduced about an hour or so into the film, who feels like a character that has come from nowhere. All of a sudden, he's now pivotal to the story, with little to no development whatsoever. I found this to be very annoying and made no sense in context with the rest of the movie. It was clear that this character should've been a presence from the beginning of the movie.Director Reed Morano has been known for great, subtle camera work on films like The Skeleton Twins and Kill Your Darlings, as well as directing episodes of great television shows like Billions and The Handmaid's Tale. I actually believe the direction here was pretty solid, due to the great performances she pulled out of these performers, but it really came down to the screenplay for me. This movie is a prime example of needing more than one writer. Written by Mark Burnell, who also penned the novel that this film an adaptation of, it almost feels counterproductive when you make a movie and have the same writer choose what elements will translate best. Sometimes a novel just doesn't translate directly to the screen and this movie truly does feel like you're slowly reading a novel, which was a real shame.In the end, The Rhythm Section begins with promise but ultimately goes nowhere in terms of providing a satisfying experience for its audience. I found myself wanting to care about who she was going after, but the movie was too bogged down in being overly dramatic. Even in moments of action, it just had a very slow feel to it. Blake Lively and Jude Law were really good in the movie and it was well-directed for the most part, but wow was it ever boring, uneventful, and sloppily put together. I feel like an entirely different film could've been made from this exact same storyline. I can't get myself to recommend it to anyone.",The Rhythm Section

58,msbreviews,"The Rhythm Section isn't as horrible as other January movies, but it still has a lot of problems...",4,7 May 2020,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)Produced by the same company that works on the James Bond films, The Rhythm Section went through tough production issues. Blake Lively injured herself on set, consequently delaying the movie until the end of 2019, and then again to the well-known ""trash month"", so obviously, my expectations were quite low. It's the first time I watch a feature film directed by Reed Morano, as well as Mark Burnell, who makes his debut as a screenwriter. As usual, the only thing I knew about the movie was its synopsis and crew, but I also caught the overwhelmingly negative feedback from critics and audiences alike...While its flaws are undeniable (and I'll get there), I don't find Reed Morano's film to be worthy of belonging in January with so many worse movies. Sean Bobbitt's cinematography is a technical standout, by delivering two fantastic one-take action sequences (one of which is edited to feel like one take), and some wide shots look genuinely stunning. I always love when a film is set in actual cities or remote locations since these offer a realistic atmosphere, and given the right treatment in post-production, the tone can be better controlled by the environment surrounding the characters.The cast is also really good. Blake Lively delivers one of the best performances of her career, definitely the most somber one. Her character is constantly placed in challenging situations, physically and emotionally. Blake incorporates Stephanie's state of mind seamlessly, carrying the narrative forward even when the latter fails to captivate the viewer. Jude Law is Jude Law, and Sterling K. Brown offers a notable display as well. However, the positives end here.Story-wise, The Rhythm Section lacks creativity and uniqueness. Besides being way too straightforward and predictable for an action-drama with a central mystery, it's edited (Joan Sobel) in such an uncommon manner that makes the movie feel incredibly tiresome. Tons of moments are drawn out for extra seconds or even minutes. Almost every scene weirdly goes on for far too long. There's no new information to transmit to the viewer, nothing is happening... The whole film is edited like this, consequently ending with almost fifteen/twenty minutes of nothing. Also, some dialogue scenes are intercut with something that's going to happen after that particular conversation, which is confusing in the sense that the viewer doesn't know where the focus is supposed to be on.Then, the actual narrative raises tons of logical questions. I hate to be ""that guy"" who nitpicks character decisions or plot points like CinemaSins (even though this channel makes so for comedy purposes), but this movie really makes the viewer wonder ""how/why the hell is she able to do this?!"" Stephanie is trained to be an agent, and while a specific part of her training is straight-up impossible, I believe that the character possesses the required skills. My issue is that she barely uses anything that she learned: she continuously runs away from everyone and everything and she gets other innocent people dead in her partially failed missions.In addition to her, there are other characters with either unclear motivations or questionable lifestyles, having in mind that this film deals with secret intelligence, terrorism, and stuff that very few people have access to or knowledge of. The score also feels extremely awkward. Similar to the editing issue, the song selection doesn't fit the dark, depressing tone that the movie carries. Sometimes, Stephanie is about to go on a serious mission, and upbeat pop music is playing... Why?All in all, The Rhythm Section isn't as awful as most January films, it certainly doesn't deserve the record of the worst opening weekend of all-time, but it still carries tons of issues. The editing (Joan Sobel) is weirdly unconventional, drawing out scenes for extra seconds or even minutes where absolutely nothing happens and intercutting dialogue sequences with unnecessary flashbacks or flashforwards. Reed Morano isn't able to bring creativity or anything remotely original to her movie, and Mark Burnell writes a predictable screenplay packed with questionable plot points and logical issues, not helping the already dull pacing. Steve Mazzaro's score doesn't fit the tone of the film, but Sean Bobbitt's cinematography delivers a couple of surprising action sequences and some neat wide shots. The cast is really good, and if not for an outstanding Blake Lively, this movie would have been a lot worse.Rating: C-",The Rhythm Section
59,timdalton007,A Would-Be Franchise Opener,6,25 May 2020,"The Rhythm Section was a film a long time coming. First announced in 2017, and made by Eon, the filmmakers behind the James Bond films, it looked to be an intriguing sideways step into the genre by the company. Yet the film was here and gone in the blink of an eye, and it's only been with it coming to streaming that this reviewer had the chance to see it.So was it worth the wait?Unquestionably, it's a film that had plenty going for it. There's Blake Lively, for example, as its protagonist Stephanie Patrick, a young British woman whose life has gone on a tailspin dive following her family's death in a plane crash. A crash that, three years later, she learns from a journalist wasn't an accident but a terrorist bombing. The film is very much a revenge thriller thanks to that revelation, but it's also the journey of Lively's Patrick from a depressed drug-addict prostitute to a woman with just enough skill to keep her from getting herself killed. Indeed, Patrick is a refreshing protagonist for the very reason that she's an outsider who, once she gets a bit of training, gets thrown into the field without turning into a flawless killing machine. Indeed, it's only through sheer luck at times that she manages to make out in more or less one piece, battered, bruised, and never entirely sure if her path is the right one. It's Lively's performance that keeps the character from being, as the character of Jude Law's Boyd, puts it, ""a cliche,"" and into someone worth following, at least for 106 minutes.The film's got other things in its favor. Sean Bobbitt's cinematography offers plenty of visually appealing elements, particularly during a lengthy section of the film set in Scotland. You'll find no better capturing of the harsh but beautiful side of that country this side of Skyfall than you will here. There are also some nicely staged action sequences, including a car chase in Tangiers that we see entirely from inside the perspective of Patrick's getaway car, which puts a nice spin on a potentially cliched sequence. It's a wonderfully visceral experience on the small screen that would have been interesting to see in a cinema. Likewise, the film has a large but engaging supporting cast including the aforementioned Jude Law as the former MI6 operative who takes Patrick under his wing when she tracks him down, Raza Jaffrey as the journalist who sets events in motion, and Sterling K. Brown as her eventual contact the ex-CIA agent turned information broker. Combined with direction from the award-winning Reed Morano, one would have thought the film would be a sure-fire hit, surely?Unfortunately, not. The Rhythm Section has two significant issues, which rather weakens it. The first lies in its pacing, with the film's opening hour being rather slow, overloaded as it is with exposition that undermines both performances and that wonderful cinematography I mentioned. Once the film gets into its latter 45 minutes or so, it suffers from the exact opposite problem, rushing along from one action sequence and character beat to the next, with a pair of significant plot twists becoming essentially throwaway moments without any weight to them. It leaves the film feeling oddly disjointed, if not confusing.That's something that likely has to do with the second issue I alluded to earlier. When I read that the film had been adapted from the opening novel in a series, the film's odd-pacing clicked into place. The Rhythm Section suffers from a problem that many a would-be franchise opener suffers from: namely, trying to tell an origin story at the expense of telling a compelling narrative. Even though it's comparatively short at 106 minutes, it's a film that feels significantly longer thanks to an overloaded front half, which leaves the back half feeling rushed and short-changed.If this was intended to be the opener for a franchise, it's one that ultimately never quite delivers what's needed. Not that it isn't worth seeing, far from it. Lively's performance, the entire cast for that matter, along with the cinematography, and some nicely staged action pieces make it worth checking out. But, there's a lot of potential here that doesn't get put to its fullest use.Perhaps the best way to look at this film, then, is to say, ""Oh, what might have been...""",The Rhythm Section

'The Rhythm Section' burns slowly and it is only the accomplished performances by the lead and Jude Law as her support that keep this snooze fest from being just about watchable.
There's also support from Sterling K. Brown who has little to do.Lively plays a woman seeking revenge after her family are killed in a plane crash that was orchestrated by terrorists.Director Reed Morano must be commended for steering her film away from being just another 'John Wick' or 'Jason Bourne' clone.
Instead Morano's film is believable.
Lively's bumbling assassin struggles just as an everyday person would if they'd been quickly trained to be a killer.
Lively plays an unconvincing killer rather convincingly.
Her character looks like she'd struggle to fight her way out of a wet paper bag never mind take on any bad guys.
Stephanie Patrick (Lively) is so inept at her assassinations that she constantly nearly gets killed and leaves clues and her DNA strewn about the crime scenes as she goes about murdering her wrongdoers.Sadly even though the action scenes are realistically staged and superbly performed they are so few and far between, this film just becomes really boring really quickly.
This is a sombre movie. Nothing onscreen draws the audience in. In fact it soon becomes hard to watch.

The first half in general really wasn't that interesting and practically nothing to engaging happened. It was either bland conversations or just attempting to make us connect to the main character which they failed to achieve but I will talk about that more later. And the whole film in general was slow paced. Even when it became slightly more interesting the intense or action scenes were cut off quickly only to be replaced with some bland plot point afterwards, some films with slow pacing can work if they have a lot of drama involved but this film really didn't.My first two positives would be the use of flashbacks and the unique POV camera angles. I really liked the use of flashbacks to establish an emotional tone and the true effects of Stephanie (Blake Lively) losing her family and how close she was with them; these weren't overused they set the tone very well. And I liked the films interesting point of view shots with some intense or action scenes. This was a unique way of showing a scene from a character's viewpoint and for the most part was engaging and interesting to watch.Next the film did a pretty good job at building tension. When there was some intense thriller scenes, they did manage to do a good job at making you feel on edge and unsure about what the outcome would be especially with Blake Lively's character. They also did do a good job at sudden noises with the soundtrack when tension is building in order to make you feel uncomfortable or to make you jump especially with any bomb scenes.However, my next two negatives would be that the lead character was very unlikeable, and you couldn't really connect with most of the characters. Blake Lively's character for the most part of the movie although largely in the first half was not very likeable and difficult to connect with her which is a concern considering she is the main character. I got that she was still grieving the loss of her family. But she had no likeable qualities to her personality, and she was just an awkward and rude person, so it took a long time for me to connect with her. And the film never really allowed you to connect with any of the other characters either. Jude laws performance was great, but you never really knew much about his character apart from the basics so it was hard for me to connect with his character despite me wanting to, and they could of done some really interesting things with the journalist who helped Stephanie but he was killed off really quickly which I thought was a slightly odd decision and it didn't really take the plot anywhere.Next, I thought the film had a fairly well executed plot twist at the end. When they revealed that Sterling k browns character was the villain and the person behind all the attacks it actually took me by surprise, and I wasn't expecting it which was nice. Yes, it could have been better executed or more explained but at least they surprised me a fair amount.My final big positives would be Blake Lively and Jude Law's performances and the on-screen chemistry they had with each other. Blake Lively really did do an excellent performance even if her character wasn't the most likeable, she portrayed an incredibly realistic version of someone grieving and feeling guilty of the loss of her family, she did a very convincing job at showing us the pain her character was going through so hats off to her. Jude Law also despite not having hardly any depth to his character bought a breath of fresh air to the movie. This was a different kind of role for him but for me it really worked, and he should consider more roles like this. He made Stephanie a more likeable character and was a good motivation to make her try harder. And the on-screen chemistry these two had was great. They both worked well together and bounced off each other's jokes really well that worked for me whenever they were on screen.However, my final two negatives that really bought the film down for me was the underwhelming amount of action and the mediocre final act. The film lacked enough action to be considered this genre, and same with its thrills and emotion to be a thriller or a drama. It didn't have anything really going for it throughout making me question why it was released in this form. When they did try and go for more action even those scenes were underwhelming. The key reason for this being sadly Blake Lively. Her performance was fantastic, but she could not hold her own In the action sequences at all. Looking unprepared and awkward. This may have been done deliberately but I don't understand why they would deliberately have underwhelming action sequences. And the ending was just mediocre there was interesting enough plot twist but not really executed that well ending the film on an awkward note and the film just didn't come together in a satisfying way.Overall, despite good performances, unique camera work and well-established tones. The rhythm section is a mediocre, underwhelming mess. That lacks enough of any elements of the genres it was trying to portray to the audience.",The Rhythm Section

Barbara Broccoli and Michael C Wilson of EON Productions who produced James Bond. So they know all about spies and action and certainly should have known better. The photography the storyline and everything except perhaps Jude Law.( Boyd) was a failure.( especially at the Box Office when according to Wikipedia, lost Paramount between $30-40m). Blake Lively is certainly no action heroine ( although she was good against a shark in The Swallows), and her character Stephanie. Patrick is not nearly as sympathetic as Riley North ( Jennifer Garner) in Peppermint. I think of the scene where she is at the gravesite of her husband and daughter Carly). I also think the drug kingpin Garcia is a much better villain then Serra here. I Also think there is a lot more hope for Riley then Stephanie ( although both get away with killing the bad guys).

81,Tcarts76,Completely Disappointing!,5,9 April 2020,"This one gets a 5 but that is because they spent a lot of money going through the standard Hollywood motions with little else to show, and then threw in a few Hollywood cliches thinking that will make them a pile of money. Don't know exactly how this did at the box office but the movie industry only has to get you to buy a ticket, not watch the whole thing or like it, to make a pile of cash.I have seen ""American Assassin,"" and,""Le Femme Nikita"" before. ""The Foreigner,"" at least has the elderly Jackie Chan doing some decent stunt work/fight scenes. This one doesn't go out as silly and unreal as America Assassin, Blake Lively isn't sexy in this one like Bridgette Fonda in Le Femme Nikita, and Jude Law is no Jackie Chan when it comes to stunt work. If you are looking for Deadpool's sexy wife, kick ass action, or any above grade awesomeness you will be sadly disappointed.The money was put in to pull together a five of a movie but it is still the same stupid story you have seen time and time again. Someone is hurt by terrorism/crime/broken heart etc, they are transformed into a superhero by the old sage and go on a deadly vendetta ride for personal justice. They then throw in the cliche of taking a beautiful actress and making her look unattractive, unless of course, she has to sex it up to get close to a villian she wants to kill.If you want another algorythmed together movie formula where the writer and director have to do little work and the actors can just phone in their performances ""The Rythmn Section,"" will wash away that hour and forty-eight minutes of your life.

82,Michael Fargo,"Thought derivatie, there's some excellence",5,4 February 2020,"The sum is disappointing given all this had going for it. Likely, the screenplay and excessive (screen time) fights made me squirm. I liked that the film was absent a lot of exposition. It kept the viewer on their toes, and the trap of feeling a need to explain unimportant background of these characters is mercifully thrown out.Blake Lively is so strong and even Jude Law didn't seem to rely on his usual need to just be creepy. Law is a strength in this film and it's mainly his physical menacing presence that moves the film forward. The model of the film relies much too much on the ""Homeland"" series, having a flawed--though strong--female central to an action film. But the tone and cinematography is consistent and artful. It uses a formula that's not original: car chase, brutally and lengthy hand-to-hand combat, a ""surprise"" that is anticipated because nothing else much is going on, frequent ""scenic"" set pieces (Inverness is spectacular).What is touching is the impact of the loss Lively's character experiences (although, I kept thinking, ""Good thing not everyone reacts to tragedy by reaching for the crack pipe). I also hope--if there's a sequel/franchise--the racism is thought through in a more responsible way. There are plenty of bad guys who aren't people of color or from the Middle East.",The Rhythm Section
83,Lewis_Heather787,Story is just boring !!! However there is room for a sequel !!!,4,16 February 2020,"Now hear me out , you are probably looking at the score/rating I gave the film and the title of my review thinking that I am a hypocrite !!! Yes you could say that, but I stand by what I mean. Trust me it makes sense , well it does in my head.As mentioned in the title, the story to this film is just plain boring. Its unoriginal , cliche , stereotypical garbage......there is nothing that is new, fresh , interesting that is brought up in this thriller. The whole basis of the story is the a woman seeking revenge for the deaths of her family who were killed in a plane crash. Said plane crash was caused by a bomb , however investigators concluded that it was a fuel tank explosion!!! NO just no I am sorry , I know your not meant to bring logic or reality into some films but this is just weak plot building . Air crash investigators wouldn't mistake a bomb for a fuel tank explosion..........they just wouldn't !!! So I cant get behind that part of the story..........Then there is the extremely quick turnaround of the central characters life.......... in the space of 40 mins to 1 hour she has gone from prostitute barely surviving with guilt to swimming in a lake training to be an assassin. I get behind it...............and all of it unfortunately is just plain boring..........I was so bored watching it.......sorry.The characters in this film so desperately needed a more interesting story as its foundation to build upon. As also mentioned in the title , I have this strangely feeling that there is a lot of room for a sequel to this or at least the start of a film franchise. The ending of the film leaves the door open, not intentionally I don't think, for a sequel because the audience now has a whole film of character history/arc that future better films could use to build upon. You know what even more strangely , I would be really open to watching a sequel to this film.The main reason for that is Blake Lively , she is a leading actress full stop. She can carry the film along as the central character , her performance I thought in this film was very good. She had a lot of range from where the character started in the film to where she ends..........she can definitely handle the physical part of the role, to be perfectly honest her performance was maybe the only part of the film that I fully bought into. That is all down to Blake Lively !!Yeah Jude Law was also good in his small role, but when is he not good ???Overall though this film is pretty poor if your asking me......due to its mind numbingly boring story that is so paper thin , cliche and stereotypical........this film is such a bore to watch.....feels much longer than 1hr 44 mins. Its 45% out of 100 or 4.5 out of 10 , however strangely I would be very open to a sequel with Blake Lively's character with a much much better story and maybe also director..........",The Rhythm Section

It follows a similar pattern to a typical revenge film beginning with tragedy, grief, training montage, then proceeding to revenge. Though, our protagonist may not be quite what you're expecting.Stephanie Patrick (Blake Lively) is a regular person, who is a smart student with a great family. When that is taken away she travels down a path of self-destruction. When the prospect of exacting revenge against those responsible for the death of her family comes along, she jumps at it. Reminder, she is a normal person with no prior training and a life of habits. She is deeply motivated, but that doesn't automatically mean she can be trained into a killing machine in a matter of months (Jude Law was excellent in his role). She most likely has not been born with the inherent ability to be a master assassin, I would suspect very few are. If anything, this scenario if far more realistic than something like 'Peppermint' which I see people trying to compare it to.Now, if we are talking about being purely entertained than perhaps this is not the one for you. But, overall it's a very watchable film with solid acting and a twist on a worn out genre.",The Rhythm Section
90,MinistryofDoom,Invokes Luc Besson's Le Femme Nikita but is Utterly Boring,4,19 January 2021,"The Rhythm Section is a borderline sub-average/average spy thriller. It is not particularly outstanding in any way whatsoever. In fact, the plot so very closely resembles the 1990 French film, Le Femme Nikita, directed by Luc Besson. Actually, it invokes Le Femme Nikita so much, that at certain points in the film you may question to yourself whether this is a remake. The problem with The Rhythm Section is that despite it's international locations, it lacks in any real entertainment, rather settling for generic and average genre-specific tropes. Throughout the course of the film, Blake Lively's character, Stephanie Patrick, goes through a transformation from a drug addicted prostitute to a globe-trotting international assassin but never once do I feel like she fully embodied her character; her performance mostly feels dull and hollow. Despite the film's attempts to build towards some ultimate climatic moment, we never actually get there.

I loved the innocence in her role, her naivety, her vulnerability and her lack of experience. But with that said, I felt that luck was definitely on her side throughout the whole movie which just wasn't realistic. Also I have no idea where she learnt those skills at the end of the movie. She went from zero fighting skills to taekwondo expert. After watching her struggle to kill for so long, it kind of was a relief.

Maybe the reviewers who weren't impressed with the acting were referring to bit players. If not, they don't have a reasonable standard for actors in films that aren't Academy Award level pieces.I liked the storyline, though scenes in the first quarter of the film dragged out far too long. The action scenes were adequate for the genre, and the emotional scenes were really pretty well played. What I appreciated was the absence of overdevelopment of characters that, while central to the story, are incidental to the telling of the story. The characters who mattered were developed well enough, leaving some mystery where that was necessary to avoid bogging the story down in too much detail.I liked this film.

It plays out somewhat blandly as she trains and goes through ups and downs before meting out her revenge with mixed results.There's a lot of interesting directions you could go with this well worn theme. You could focus on her struggle to absolve herself of guilt and loss, ultra violent action revenge fetishism, dramatic turns of the political complexities of terrorism, her rebirth as a vengeful spirit etc. Unfortunately it really doesn't do much of any one thing or anything well. It just sort of happens and then its over.

It sounded like a reasonable plot; revenge is always sweet I find, personally and in entertainment form.Regrettably, after the plot is set up, the whole movie falls more than a bit flat. We witness Stephanie spending evidently months in Scotland being tutored by Jude Law in hand-to-hand combat, self defence, knife skills, assassination techniques and all that good stuff and what we have at the end of all of that is an ""assassin"" who couldn't pull the skin off a cold custard. Every assassination assignment she's given is botched because she has neither the skills nor the willingness to go through with the job. And, on top of that, she also wanted $US2 million for one job. I wouldn't have paid her a dollar fifty given her previous performance.Over all, ""The Rhythm Section"" was somewhat reminiscent of Luc Besson's ""Nikita"" from 1990 and also of the American Remake of Nikita ""The Assassin"" aka ""Point Of No Return"" from 1993. But both of the latter movies were infinitely superior to the one that being reviewed here.I really didn't like ""The Rhythm Section"" at all because it was just so frustrating watching a woman, motivated by malice, but whose ineptitude didn't enable her in fact to do anything to satisfy her justifiable desire for revenge.Not quite rubbish but horribly close.JMV",The Rhythm Section

The pace picked up and the story became interesting after 30 minutes. Blake Lively impressed me with her British accent and there was good chemistry between her and Jude Law. It was refreshing to not see a 10 minute montage of her training to be an assassin and then automatically know how to kill her target straight away, but instead to see her gradually build up her confidence, showing the struggles more realistically. I am pleased I saw it through as it would have been a lower score if I hadn't, but I feel the film earned the score I have given.

Unfortunately the script is poorly written and directed and is really just 2 slow mundane acts of building up a Femme Fatale Nikita character or more aptly the Prozac Bimbo Brunette and the 3rd act finally gets some rhythm with some horrible dull mismatched music and the main character never really evolves into anything. Blake does her best to keep it alive with endless shots of her pouting face close ups but its impossible to feel much depth with so little character development to the story film, esp with Reeds dreadful directing and so many close ups and shaky camera moves it just does not work in this story. I love Reeds other films but action is definitely not her gig. Broccoli family should stick to James Bond films. The Jane Bond film idea requires a much better well rounded character building / action script and this one is highly unrealistic, lacks any depth of character and there are so many holes it puts you to sleep esp the dreadful score. Plus Blake gets her ass kicked more times than she delivers and somehow the writer thought this was a solid idea for a female driven Bond/Bourne film. It is shocking this film was made esp for 50M budget. It feels like a 5M budget film esp the way it was directed.

In the scene, Jude Law's character utters ""That is not tragedy. It's a cliché."" That sums it up perfectly. This is an awful movie in every way. Not only is the movie loaded with clichés, there's awful writing, it's boring as hell, and it's got a predictable plot twist on top of that. Even on surface level, it appears to be like any other Bond-esque thriller/revenge story, something comparable to Atomic Blonde, for instance. However, it's not only bland, it fails to live up to the standards of those movies in any regard.Our heroine, Stephanie (Blake Lively), is a protagonist who feels more like a silent video game protagonist than a character in a movie. Her backstory is so simple and clichéd yet they drag it out to try and get you to feel for her right from the get-go. It's like Batman v Superman on steroids. Her motive? Revenge, nothing you've never seen before. We also have a mentor with a dark past, can't miss that. And to top it off, it has a plot twist at the end, but it's so laughably predictable that it'll surprise you when it's revealed because you'll think they already handled it. Even if you're a die-hard action movie fan, you have no reason to watch this. It has nothing to offer you that you haven't already seen a million times or can see a better version elsewhere.This movie also holds a few unique distinctions at the box office, holding impressive records like ""worst opening weekend of all time,"" and ""biggest theater drop of all time.""

Lively is not box office material because she's a so-so actress. Nothing great since Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants which was very endearing. A Simple Favor and The Shallows were great stories executed well, but people did not go to those movies to see Blake.She was probably the only name actress desperate enough for such a part, willing to score another one for affirmative action, diversity, and victim-hood. But she drew the short straw with this debacle. Most do not see heroin and other dalliances as inevitable choices after personal tragedy.I am biased. ""Atomic Blond"" is the gold standard now. It is the great spy/revenge film where a stunning Charlize Theron did her own stunts. She had long, unedited fight scenes. Plus, the story was brilliant and the ending superb. This one shows up the clunker actress as wrong for the part and not willing to go the distance in preparation. She does not have the physicality, presence, or skills necessary so it is over-edited.

109,helenbassett,The Rhythm Section Film Review - Reed Morano Directs Blake Lively In An Assassin's Trail Of A Murderer,8,27 February 2020,"When Stephanie Patrick didn't get on the plane, it sets in motion a trail that sees her chase down those responsible for her family's deaths. Blake Lively goes grunge for director Reed Morano and the Mark Burnell screenplay of his novel The Rhythm Section. Never knowing why she didn't get on the plane with her family, but Stephanie's life was one of love and happiness with them.But coping with survivor's grief sent Stephanie into a downwards spiral of self-loathing, eased by heroin addiction and paid for on her back in a brothel. And that's where Raza Jaffrey's freelance journalist Kevin Proctor finds her. Her family were not killed in the tragic air crash he tells her, but by a bomb. With the truth, and killer, hidden by our government. Let's pretend our government doesn't have any evidence that Tawfeek Barhom's Reza built the bomb, so he is at large, or maybe they just don't have enough police to follow him. Anyway they vehemently deny it was a bomb. Who are they protecting? If indeed it actually happened. And initially Stephanie doesn't believe it either. But when she sees detailed research in Kevin's flat, it fires her up, and armed with a seriously ill advised illegal gun, she stalks Reza in his university cafeteria. After making eye-contact, but unable to take the shot, Reza escapes.If Stephanie is going to track this gone to ground killer down, she needs serious training with Kevin's source at MI6, B, played by an off grid Jude Law in the Highlands. Producer Barbara Broccoli suggests Stephanie is possibly a female Bond for women, but if so she needs to toughen up. Our heroin addicted prostitute has some hard training ahead of her before she can pass herself off as an assassin. And meet with B's contact, ex-CIA operative Serra, played by Sterling K. Brown. It has shades of Bond when the marks take Stephanie around the world. Her kick-ass ineptitude is endearing, but she's no Baby Driver, instead the Rhythm Section is suggested by B to control her breathing during her hits. But in this new profession, indecision is likely to get you killed. Or someone else.I have enjoyed watching Blake Lively since The Age Of Adeline, and here she is equally watchable with Jude Law, and gives her all. But the story line went a bit AWOL midway, with who did what, when and why, and in between the great stunt work by Blake and the stunt team, the big reveal was a bit of a let down. Casting my eye over the book tends to imply that there is much more to the story than the film run time allowed. And if the books continue to be filmed then I'm all up for more Stephanie Patrick. And the ending did leave an opening for more.",The Rhythm Section

Her physical transformation is impressive and her acting chops in the lake sequence are incredible. The action is solid and the car chase scene is beautifully shot (just one take). Jude Law as the instructor is fine and Raza Jaffrey makes an impression despite his small screen time. The plot, however, is predictable and rushed in some points. For example, the sex scene is awkward and out place because it's never established a romantic tension between Lively and Brown. The training of Stephanie is rushed and you never feel that she is ready for the assassinations. This becomes obvious when she starts making one mistake after another (she even kills inooccent people). It's never been explained why Stephanie is chosen to accomplish the mission. Why the reporter approaches her and why Jude Law trains her? Moreover, many music choices don't match the corresponding scenes.

128,michaeldoud,First Hit: This is Blake Lively's (as Stephanie Patrick) movie from beginning to end.,8,4 February 2020,"First Hit: This is Blake Lively's (as Stephanie Patrick) movie from beginning to end.Blake Lively can act, and here we see how good she can be.The story opens by letting us know that Patrick is a lost soul. She is slowly destroying herself by using heroin and supporting this habit through prostitution. We learn that Stephanie has turned to this life of self-destruction because she lost her entire family in a suspicious plane crash three years earlier. She was supposed to be on that plane.A reporter named Keith Proctor (Raza Jaffrey) comes to the brothel and buys time with Stephanie so that he can speak with her about what he's working on. Proctor is investigating who are the people who planted the bomb on the plane that killed her parents. Patrick, unsure of Procter's real intention, dashes out of the room and gets the house bouncer to physically throw Proctor out. She doesn't want to be reminded of her pain.However, Proctor left his business card, and as Patrick gets ready to hit up with another dose of smack, she decides to bolt out of the brothel ending up at Proctor's London apartment. The verbal sparring here is wonderfully done because Proctor holds his ground of just wanting to get more information and to give Patrick information about what really happened to the plane. Patrick, on the other hand, is utterly scared about having to face her own demons and re-live the emotional loss of her family.Proctor has a room where there is a photo of each of the plane crash victims along with piles of folders containing information and evidence about what really happened on that plane. It includes information about who ordered the bombing, who made the bomb, and who set it off.Getting the name of the person who built the bomb, Raza (Tawfeek Barhom), Patrick sets out to find him and get payback. But as she confronts Rasa face to face, in a moment of panic she cannot pull the trigger. However, because he's now been discovered, Raza finds and takes it out on Proctor.With Proctor no longer being able to help, Patrick uses one more bit of information from the files she took from Proctor's apartment, a location on a map. Traveling to this location in a remote norther area of Scotland, she finds Iain Boyd ""B"" (Jude Law), a former MI6 agent.She convinces B that she is going to kill the bomb maker and all the people associated with the bombing of the plane and asks him to train her. Skeptical of Stephanie's abilities, B relents and teaches her how to shoot, fight, and keep fit while also giving her information on where she might find Raza and the unknown mastermind.The thing that is most compelling in this story is how slowly we see Patrick's incremental change from strung-out addict (pale, thin, haunting eyes, and bruised up) to someone who is not a fighting machine but a healthier person. We see her dive to right the wrong to her family and assuage her underlying guilt for not being on the plane with them.Like an everyday person, Patrick never overwhelms anyone when she's fighting, she's authentically fighting for her life. She's appropriately scared and clearly driven. And this is what makes this story engaging as Stephanie makes her way to find and resolve her family's death.All the scenes are well shot from the car chase scene to her training with B to the bus explosion. However, it is the time with Marc Serra (Sterling K. Brown), especially their last scene, where we see that Stephanie Patrick has learned what she needs to learn about herself and her abilities. She has freed herself from her past.Lively is absolutely mesmerizing as this character. It is the grittiest role I've seen her in, and she nails it. Law is terrific as the elusive former MI6 Agent put to pasture. His direct approach to helping Patrick was excellent. Brown was engagingly cagey and incredible as the former CIA agent who sells information to bad people. Jaffrey was wonderful as the news reporter wanting to get to the truth. Mark Burnell wrote a powerful and pointedly direct script. Reed Morano got the best out of the actors while engagingly directing scenes keeping the audience fully engaged the entire time.Overall: I really liked the way this story came together and the acting, all around, was superb.",The Rhythm Section

Very quickly, despite the attempts at a gritty vibe (the beautiful Lively is uglied up to look like an emaciated, disease-ridden hooker) the story is so crazy and unbelievable in so many spots that we can never settle in and enjoy the ride. In fact, by the time the third act rolls around, we're really confused (at least I was) and don't know why anyone is doing what they're doing. Yes, there are parts that are unintentionally funny: many of the ""training"" bits come to mind.

There is just to much filler in the middle & not much of anything else, i understand some story is important to know what is going on but this is one of those films where you can feel there won't be much action within the film until near the end.There is a lot of travelling about in the film to different locations just to find out some facts, it honestly doesn't make for a interesting watch or keep you hooked for the long run. After all of that we then get into some action finally, yes some of the action scenes are good but when it came to her trying to kill someone you could tell she wouldn't do it but it does change the usual cliche of someone from the bottom rising to the top & becoming this crazy killer we are all use to seeing but you could just tell from her character she wouldn't.Overall its one of those films that no one saw advertised, had a low budget & was never going to be a 10/10 film nor be in the top 10 best films, luckily i have the unlimited card so it doesn't bother us (My film group) but i wouldn't pay to see this.

After that the story slips and the ending killed it for me. The main character becomes too cool for school, throws a couple one liners and the with the final scene and song, the film somehow finishes in an upbeat note. The tonal shift was jarring, what happened to the ""trust me, it's not worth it"" theme the movie had going on?Now for the technical aspect, it terrible shot. In the beginning I was bothered by the editing, but that got overshadowed real quick. A lot of the scenes, even most to be honest, were shot with wide lenses. The picture was constantly distorted. Why¿ Then we have the out of focus shots, or the many close ups where everything in the background was out of focus. That's how the whole movie is made.Another thing we did get to do, was learn more about the main character. We kept being shown the same silent scenes with her mother or some other family members again and again, instead of parts of her life before the plane crash.

By the time we introduce the second cold, stumbling character, I found myself thinking about other movies, other things, traumas that friends had suffered and survived, and if this film would upset them, interest them, or what.

142,World-viewer,Awful. Just Awful. Just call it Section 8 instead..,2,19 October 2020,"In brief: This is nothing but a hormone soaked remake of American Assassin.*minor spoilers ahead* - nothing major - the movie itself is so spoiled, there is really no hope of recovering from the shambling mess that it isHere's a brief synopsis. The grief-stricken victim of a plane crash (Lively) which took her family, vows to become an assassin after being told by a journalist that the plane's downing was a terrorist attack. She somehow manages to link up with a rogue MI-6 agent (Jude Law), whose address, indeed exact coordinates are simply lying around in the journos flat. Jude takes her under his wing and develops her from a whiny drug-addicted prostitute to whiny killer in a few months. His sparse quarters in the Scottish hinterland somehow have all the appurtenances of a military training camp, including a full-on gun range with a human-like target course, along with an unlimited supply of normally illegal ammunition. Bear in mind, guns, by and large are illegal in the UK.Unfortunately for all involved, no matter the amount of training, this is an assassin who is more competent at hysterical screaming and emotional outbursts than any combat or killing. Meet the world's first squeamish and morally upright assassin, for whom killing even the most dastardly of evil-doers is just a step too far.The movie is just awful. A writhing mess of face-palm moments, the saving grace of which is that they are so inept and incredulous, you feel compelled to watch just to see how much more ridiculous the whole thing will get. The so called plot itself is written by someone who has never seen a spy movie nor has any inkling of the basics of how the espionage-ridden underworld of spies actually works. If they did, well, they have a funny way of showing it. You don't need to be a CIA expert to realize the plot is laughably inadequate, and that the character profile of the person swearing death and vengeance upon the terrorists, is in fact, no more capable of executing such a mission than the average housewife around the block, that too, without any training. She spends most of the time looking morose and in a grieving fugue state than providing any level of confidence that the months of training invested in her are worth any trainers time.Perhaps the biggest mystery is why the rogue MI6 agent sends her, despite her obvious inadequacies, to execute missions, rather than doing them himself, as he obviously has nothing better to do. And despite kicked-out of from MI6, he still somehow manages to stay abreast of every minute-to-minute development in the terrorist landscape, feeding her times, dates, names and locations of of people to meet to get to the root of the terrorist web. The internet connection in the desolate lochs of Scotland must be phenomenal.The cinematography though is surprisingly good - esp the first person POV camerawork in a car chase scene, one where Blake is hysterically screaming in terror that she's being shot at, while being chased after she accidentally does manage to kill someone with a great deal of difficulty (a wheelchair bound wheezing villain who needs oxygen at set intervals).Bottom line is that this movie is just an awful soapy attempt at a revenge thriller. The fashion and trend these days is to have female leads, and make them look and feel empowered to make up for the past stereotyping - make them more than a match for James Bond or Jason Bourne - as Noomi Rapace tried to do in the much better film ""Close"". This movie does the opposite - reinforces the stereotypes of the 60s screaming, hysterical, estrogen-filled overly emotional female who faints at the sight of blood. It comes off more as Jason Bourne meets Eat Pray Love. It does improve near the end, but not enough. Not enough.",The Rhythm Section

If you see this movie you'll have a new understanding of what a good haircut can do for a person. I'll add that most scenes were just gorgeously shot. The plot wasn't as captivating for me as it had the potential to be. The build up to the last 20 maybe 30 minutes seemed a little slow and often hard to follow.

156,joshteggert,'The Rhythm Section' ultimately fails to find its own rhythm in amongst all the chaos and confusion.,3,12 February 2020,"Revenge stories are the archetypal foundation of the over-saturated ""celebrity-with-a-gun-and-a-mission"" brand of cinema. 'The Rhythm Section', which features Mark Burnell who wrote the book this film is based on as its screenwriter, sees Blake Lively as the distraught and downtrodden Stephanie Patrick, seeking vengeance for the death of her family in an airline crash which isn't what it seems. Director Reed Morano tries to convince us that this film is something more, something deeper than just the typical personal journey towards retribution. Yet 'The Rhythm Section' ultimately fails to find its own rhythm in amongst all the chaos and confusion.The film's first act is slow but grounded, laying the foundations of the story adequately enough to propel the narrative forward. We open with Stephanie, who has resorted to drugs and prostitution in the years succeeding the crash. But after a journalist comes to her with information suggesting it wasn't an accident, she seeks the help of a man known only as B (Jude Law) to exact revenge on those responsible for her family's death.Lively does a sound job of portraying this tortured soul but isn't allocated half as much time as necessary to really get to know the character. Superficiality and convenience take precedence instead; Stephanie's backstory is reduced to a series of what seem to be phone-camera montages of her late family, plonked carelessly into the narrative as flashbacks. To make matters more artificial, she manages to transform from a heroin addict into a trained - if heavily flawed - assassin in just 8 months, which demands significant suspense of disbelief (and not in the fun way that the 'John Wick' franchise requires with all its brilliant, hyperbolised killing-sprees).'The Rhythm Section' also lacks any sort of style or finesse. Admittedly, it's well shot - there is a stimulating car chase scene executed in one take - but for a revenge film such as this to be so brief with its action, it must make up for in character development and flair. Morano can't quite tune the film with enough precision to elevate a derivative and predictable plot structure and doesn't deliver on the hinted psychological impacts this lifestyle might have on someone who is clearly hanging on by a thread.The film, therefore, is as muddled and out of its depth as its central character - a serious story which is difficult to take seriously. Despite the author of the book penning the screenplay, 'The Rhythm Section' is a protracted ride which plods awkwardly towards an obvious conclusion, rarely swaying from the confounds of its self-imposed cliché-fest.",The Rhythm Section

Apparently that's enough combat training to take out bigwigs in a terrorist ring.Not to mention that the poor writing ensures that at no point do you feel for the protagonist given how ungrateful, arrogant and cliched she comes across as. Asking for huge favors and then discarding the same people who helped her at a whim or getting them killed. All this after the softball setup where the protagonist was actually wronged by the bad guys and they still blew it.No other character in the movie gets any development or much screentime, the 'mentor' character just turns out to be a convenient plot device with no character buildup at all.",The Rhythm Section

Ordinary every day person with a loving family living the dream is shattered by terrorist attack. The surviving victim of the terrorist attack is like a caterpillar going into a cocoon and emerging as a lethal weapon, avenging the brutal deaths of their lost loved ones. Both characters in each movie had their CIA/MI6 Trainers and Handlers guiding them through their tirade. Both movies concluded with a perception of a promising sequel(s).Some how American Assassin was able to accomplish the exact same thing while at a comfortable pace. Rhythm Section felt slow at long stretches during the same points of the plot as American Assassin. That's my personal negative opinion on this movie.I have zero issues with women playing these characters. I enjoy leading women playing in these movies. Blake Lively is and was amazing in this movie. As long as they're not agenda driven based on political theology and clearly pushing the fake gender war or purposely changing history or changing the long standing originality of a fairy tail with the sole purpose of inserting a different gender which has zero to do with the story. As long as the acting is great, plot is good, keep pumping out these strong women playing strong characters.With that said the timing of the release of this movie during Super Bowl weekend probably crushed any chance of sequels.

That in itself was a problem for me as I did not find the character redeemable as a person and could not connect with her as a human being.Without giving away the plot, Stephanie never shows the potential to be a killing machine that the movie wants us to believe and she escapes from one situation after the other with more luck that President trump and his escapades. Now that I have written this, Stephanie Patrick should run for the highest office in the sequel novel or movie or tv series.The training sequences were insipid, action sequences were bland and the protagonists ability for espionage with no tactical training was laughable at best.

To make matters worse, many scenes look like they're shot on a mobile phone. A fashion fad of modern movie-making in an attempt presumably to make scenes feel more real and gritty. There is distinct lack of direction. The acting is barely adequate and the plot to avenge Lively's family becomes confused and intangible. There are many scenes where nothing happens, as if the director is relying on the many and varied locations to make up for lack of script.

If there is a squalid bathroom scene in a movie I close my eyes and just listen to the dialogue, and here the squalor went on and on. The city looked squalid, the journalist's flat was squalid, the loch side cottage was squalid, and the dirty, cowering wreck of a character just put the tin hat on it, just repulsive. Even the lovely land of some of my forefathers, Scotland, was made to look uninviting. You need something to keep you watching and it just didn't have anything.

194,buckybit,"Nikita, Anna, Hanna ... Atomic Blonde gone black ...",7,20 November 2020,"... you would be inclined to set this movie within this scope of references. It is also a revenge movie as it is an 'origin' story of a Jane Bond type of character.What sets this movie apart from the ones mentioned above is a different pacing (for which some seem to fault it, yet, it is the movie's strength). The dramatic, fast-cut trailer sort of oversells the action, yet, it is a trailer, so viewers come in with certain expectations, naturally.Blake Lively plays a vulnerable woman, not a super-human assassin. She does not turn suddenly into one.In fact, all the fight and action sequences in this movie - as well choreographed and timed, as in any good action flic - have her succeeding, besides the odds against her. The action is based on unpredictability and accidents, which let her survive one more day, to move on.It is believable in a way many other movies (including the one's mentioned above) turn them into comic heroine music videos (Atomic Blonde), or a superhuman (Hanna), or into way to polished sequences, topping tops on top of tops, marinating in their own excellence (Anna, the god-awful Red Sparrow and of course Mendes' James Bond movies, etc, etc.)The overall story, while predictable, does not try to throw sudden red herrings at you, but stays the course to a satisfying ending. I have not read the novel by Mark Burnell (who also wrote the script for the movie).Make-up on the main character in the early part of the movie is remarkable. The music score is excellent, sound design is good, being part of the narrative.Cinematography and editing are well crafted. Blake Lively (whom I have not watched in her early TV career) owns the screen. There are two-three early, short scenes where she convincingly plays someone who was physically abused (by men) due to the circumstances we find her in (will not spoil it for you).The wardrobe of the main character stands out throughout the movie. Jude Law has a fun part in this one.

The problem with the movie lies in the fact that in spite of a meager attempt at training our would-be assassin for 8 months, she has the skills of you, the movie goer. Now imagine yourself as an international assassin. That's about how good she is. So If you think you'd enjoy seeing the beautiful Blake Lively get her ask kicked by 10 people, this is the movie for you. It's almost like reverse action.

Or for money? A task from CIA? I am confused!But I enjoyed the scenery, Scotland, Tangiers, and (Marseille?), nice view. TBH, I don't really understand why the title is Rhythm Section?

Is it too much to ask for an enjoyable female assassin's film with convincing support? When is the film industry gonna stop painting female revenge-makers as less than what they are? Or do we have to force Tarantino to create one again?
Is this female protagonist driven by revenge or victimization? Not only the confusion, but also the deprivation of ones imagination - the story pushes for the end and leaves nothing to long for. The false suspension in every fight scene may as well have been created as a way to portray her incompetence as an international assassin (the irony) and somehow invite us to her state of mind, however it failed to embark on that path from the very beginning.

I'd love to see more about Lively's character, Stephanie, development as an assasin/spy, although her first 'job' was really done well (cinematicly speaking). this movie was evidently cut to fit a given timeframe, and that leaves us with wanting to know and experience more about Stephanie.same goes with Jude Law's character, that's insturmental but the movie doesn't really even scratch the surface of this possibly very interesting and deep character. the mystery man behind the bombings - that was too fast too easy too. we haven't really got to know them, which is a shame really.at this point it would only be a 6, maybe 7-star movie, but Blake Lively made all the difference. her acting is superb, I had so much pleasure watching her playing without any false note. I hope this role is a breakthrough in her career, because she clearly can achieve greatness. it's easily a 9-star performance.there were complaints about camera work or directing here too - well, I really liked how certain scenes were filmed, especially the car chase, where a 'shaky' camera corresponded well with Stephanie's clear lack of skills, confusion and sort of helplessness. I like how she's being portrayed throughout the whole film, having this semi-detached experession of hers collapsing into insecurity and fear in a matter of a single frame.I bet if rewievs were kinder, this could be a start of a really solid franchise. I'd really like to see a more inteligent take on the genre, without a trillion-dollar budget, and all those ""breathtaking"" silly stunts, and mostly - a female lead character. but I guess my wish won't materialize, and I wonder how different viewers' and critics' response would've been, if this was another story about an ex-marine played by Wahlberg, Statham or someone like that...anyway, 6/7 for the film alone and 9 for Blake Lively make it 7,5-8 in my book. it's by far the best action/drama movie I've seen in a very long time, and one I'll definitely miss not having a follow-on.",The Rhythm Section

There is a touch of humour between her and Jude Law but no vapid wisecracks or one-liners. The dialogue is lean, just enough to explain the plot, without trivializing the tragedy of the story with forced witticism. I sometimes needed to pause the movie to absorb revealed details of plot and character, so you have to pay attention.

A simple revenge thriller.A few years after her parents and siblings died I a plane crash, Stephanie (Blake Lively) is living as a prostitute, tormented from the deaths. She's discovered by a journalist (Raza Jaffrey) who reveals that the crash wasn't an accident. This leads her directly into a global crusade of vengeance, with the help of a former M16 Agent (Jude Law).First off, the execution is great. Reed Morano directs gritty scenes with an indie flair and an intense realism to them. Her style uses a lot of darkness and silhouettes to set the scene, refraining from the urge to light up the place just to make it seem more slick. One car chase in particular stood out as a one-take like shot that was really impressive.Blake Lively commands the leading role. She portrays the broken Stephanie so perfectly and it's refreshing seeing an action lead fall flat on her face so much. It's never easy for the character during the fight scenes. Her chemistry with Law is also really great to watch.The story is by the numbers with twists and turns that don't really gain an emotional response or a surprising one.

In such movies there is a underdog who is may be a bit weak but through his/her sheer intent, focus, clarity, will power and heart, at the end emerges victorious. And she does that by getting kicked from all sides, panics all the time, gets confused in the chaos created by her own self and escapes just because of sheer luck. One one side is revenge and her anger and pain and has the full will to kill the bad guys and on the other side when it actually comes to the killing part, she gets soft and ruins all her missions and keeps crying.

This movie instead owes a more to revenge films of 70s, where character and motivation could be explored more leisurely. Most of the tension is created because the heroine is not trained, or even emotionally prepared, for getting the revenge she thinks she needs. She's primarily guided by crushing guilt, not elite training, which makes for a completely different experience than the usual shoot-em-ups.I'm always happy to see a different take on an old, bloated genre, even if the end result takes some suspension of disbelief to allow for a new, different character who doesn't fit the unstoppable superhero mold.",The Rhythm Section

Did he think we were suffering from the same disease as Memento?The scenery was great. The action was ok. The camera work decisions were questionable. When the character was running or driving, we got what I would call running with an iPhone cam. It was very distracting and it took you out of the movie.So, should you see this movie? I would say not in theaters. I would save this for Netflix where you can watch several movies for a flat rate. I really hoped that it would be better.

But even so, it reminds me of Luc Besson's film with the same ideas, Beautiful young woman with drug problems and prostitution, recruited by a former MI6, who trains her to transform her into a professional murderer, with the purpose that in addition to her revenge staff do your dirty work to you. Forgetting that a little about the film, Blake Lively continues to prove that she is not just a pretty face, she is a very good actress, the music produced by Hans Zimmer, even if he does not execute it, it shows in the distance, and the locals well accomplished .

296,akasacoral,"Great premise, Fantastic acting, Mediocre Execution",7,31 January 2020,"I was so excited for this film that I actually went to see it yesterday. It could be me, maybe I was expecting a lot from this movie because it's directed by Reed Morano and because of its premise. I also read several reviews and saw that everybody compared this movie to a female-led James Bond. It's not. Not even close.It's a different demon of its own, and certainly not the first of its kind. Aside from the other films with a revenge theme though, the lead character is not a femme fatale, she's not a numb secret service spy gone rogue. This is a real person becoming an assassin. However the lead character, Stephanie, could have been explored a bit more. Right now, from where she's standing, the character still has some shallow parts. Stephanie's entire family was killed in a terror attack on an airplane and since then, she is feeling so helpless, and so guilty that she's essentially punishing herself by being a prostitute in a brothel in a North African country. She feels incredibly deep levels of loneliness and she can't find any motivation to live, along with the guilt of not being on that airplane with her now deceased family. Until she witnesses something that triggers something within her.The score is by Hans Zimmer which makes the viewing experience in a theatre really special. His character cues and use of different instruments based on the lead character's heart beat at that scene is very engaging. Which wraps up the title of the film with the premise. ""Rhythm Section"" refers to your heartbeat, so having carefully written music that reflects the premise really adds something special to the picture.Blake Lively is phenomenal in this movie. She really carries the entire picture whereas I found the antagonist/s to be somewhat dull and needing more development. They weren't interesting enough to carry the stakes higher and higher so the climax was not as surprising as the writer intended it to be, for me. Which bring me to Jude Law's character, which was a good one but again, could have been further developed to create a deeper connection with the viewer. The only character I cared for while watching the entire movie was Stephanie and I felt like there was so much potential for the other characters.All in all, Reed Morano's particular directing style gives the movie a scrappy look, which I believe is intentional. Perhaps the story parts that bothered me were because the screenwriter is also the author of the book this movie originates from. All in all, I still think the premise is really great -- and that it's worth seeing.",The Rhythm Section

299,kieran2019,The thinking person's revenge thriller,9,18 April 2020,"I don't normally leave reviews for many movies but I felt I had to leave one for 'The Rhythm Section' as it turns out to be so much better than the reviews on here would suggest. It's true that if you enjoy popcorn rollercoaster movies like 'John Wick' or 'Atomic Blonde', you may find this movie too slow or lacking in action. Personally I find action movies like the ones I have just mentioned to be very boring and to me they are like watching somebody else playing a video game on an indestructible cheat mode.
If on the other hand, you don't have attention deficit disorder, if you have ever read a book, if don't get bored when there's not a gunfight or car chase every ten minutes, then you may well enjoy this one.
This is a slow burn atmospheric movie. It does have action including killings, car chases and explosions but they are not over the top and unbelievable. They take a while to arrive but when they come they are incredibly tense as they have an air of (relative) realism.
The cinematography is great. The film is beautifully lit with lots of atmosphere and natural light. I've read reviews complaining about a 'shaky cam' style of filming (which is something that I personally don't like). But I was relieved to find that's just not true. I was only aware of handheld shaky style footage during less than one minute of a chase sequence.
The acting is great from both Blake Lively who is brilliant and on screen for most of the movie, and also from Jude Law.
Overall I'd call this the thinking person's revenge thriller. If you like films which have a bit of art to them such as Lynne Ramsay's 'You Were Never Really Here', then you will probably enjoy 'The Rhythm Section'. If you need dumb wall to wall action instead, well there are already so many films which cater to you.",The Rhythm Section

Almost as if the Indie Director started it but had to leave it to the Hollywood AD to finish. The first half was dark and gritty with a realism often only found in in the saddest of tales. Think Trainspotting with more than a hint of inspiration from The Place Beyond The Pines. They set the tone well and paint the characters perfectly, with a clear path to investment for the viewer. You couldn't help but care for the main protagonist, superbly played by Lively. Then there's her mentor, also played to a key by the always brilliant Law. After an all too familiar training montage which ticks all the boxes, the movie ticks over to Hollywood AD and off our heroine goes to fulfil her role as justifiable avenger. This is where the movie starts to swerve a bit and where I would say stick with it for the eventual evolution. The soundtrack is perfect, the story just this side of believable and the gritty realism perfectly enhanced with fantastic locations for each set piece.

She gets more people killed than she actually successfully kills. Her mistakes are costly for those who provide her information, and even her victims' innocent family members . From that perspective, there really is a good healthy dose of (presumed) reality. It is messy all the way around. Can barely bring herself to avenge her family's death. Although I don't like the other unrealistic extreme of victim turned super killer, this seems to swing too far the other way. Not as dark as some, but still relatively dark. But she finally pulls it together in the end, which I won't spoil.

We get lots of close-ups of Ms. Lively brooding and looking roughed up. Lots and lots of needless flashbacks, that do nothing to move the plot forward. And we get lots and lots of scenes that essentially do nothing. Instead of action for the the first half of the movie, we get sudden, loud music intended to imply there's action occurring when there is none.Then we have the editing, or lack thereof. Did anyone making this film realize it's an action movie? Instead, we get incredibly long scene after scene that could have been cut by 50-75% with no harm to the plot, greatly helped to keep the movie moving, and, most of all, kept us from going to sleep. The director and screenwriter were apparently so in love with their artistry they forget to entertain us,Lastly, I almost never give up on a movie, no matter how badly made or numbskull it is. I figure there's always something to be gained by watching it to the end. But, sadly, this one was so insufferably, needlessly slow moving, with so many plot gaps and absurdities I threw in the towel 2/3 the way through. Even the beauty and considerable acting skills of Ms. Lively couldn't keep me from enduring this exercise in watching paint dry.

Her attitude from the having lost her family was believable and her accent was convincing. The scene where she confronts the bomber in the cafeteria was tense and when the backpack went missing the fear was palpable.
Jude Law did a good job as the former MI6 agent and the training scenes were believable. The producers didn't give the impression that Stephanie was suddenly made into an unstoppable assassin, just a competent one.
It was refreshing for a protagonist assassin to be fallible and not indestructible (particularity after having just watched the ridiculous John Wick 3.) There were many tense, edge of your seat scenes to keep me watching. The car chase scenes were exciting and believable.
The bus scene in Spain was excellent and the pyrotechnics were really well done (nice to see an exploding vehicle actually get ripped apart and not just rise straight up in the air like in so many Hollywood action movies)

It stuck with me. Her performance was great. Jude Law for sure was a bust. But, it sustains your interest which is more than I can say about a lot of other movies out there.

337,mrethdog,Didn't have the rhythm,1,3 February 2020,This movie was incredibly boring from start to finish. 50% of the movie was just close ups of Blakes face and flashbacks. Lacked any 'rhythm' so to speak. A waste of money,The Rhythm Section

339,Yamello,Can't Find the Beat,4,31 January 2020,"In ""The Rhythm Section"", Blake Lively stars as Stephanie, a grief-stricken drug addict who discovers her family's tragic deaths were not what they seemed. She sets out to find answers and justice. It's an intriguing if familiar premise, but is it worth watching?The GoodThe film has a small cast but it's leading lady carries the load easily. Blake Lively continues her upward trajectory after strong turns in ""The Shallows"" (2016) and ""A Simple Favor"" (2018). She gives a wounded performance as Stephanie, a woman whose spirit died along with her family; a still-living victim of a tragedy. Everything from her gaze to how she carries herself screams brokenness. I also liked Jude Law as Boyd, an ex MI6 recluse. He's a hard-ass mentor figure for Stephanie as he attempts to give her skills to survive on her quest for revenge. He's like Obi-Wan Kenobi if Old Ben was a jerk. He provides a more harsh, stark view of the situation, reality-checking Stephanie again and again.Another aspect of Stephanie I enjoyed was how inefficient she is as an assassin. After she completes her training and heads into the world to seek vengeance she proves to be rather ineffective. I thought she would finish training and immediately turn into a ruthless expert killer, but she proves to not be cut out for it. She lacks the moral numbness and skill to pull it off, which makes her more relatable. There's also a cool chase scene that's a continuous shot from within the vehicle. It's shot well and accompanied by a good score at times. I also appreciated the color pallet of the film, lots of muted, cold colors to reflect the bleak outlook of our protagonist.The BadThe movie has a good first act, setting up an intriguing revenge tale that fizzles out in the second. We never get to know Stephanie, she isn't given character development. She has a goal that she desperately wants to fulfill but she doesn't change as a result of achieving that goal. She's the same character by the end as she was in the beginning, only she's sober now. When a revenge film like this lacks action and style it must make up for that with character and story, and it fails on both counts. Altogether, it feels like connecting dots that never create a cohesive image.The talented Sterling K Brown is dragged into this to give information and wear glasses. He never feels like a character, he's more of a plot device. The score is good in a few scenes, but the soundtrack is off. Thirty seconds of a Velvet Underground song here and a Brenda Lee song there for fifteen seconds. It's like hitting shuffle on a varied playlist at random times. I also wish the filmmaker leaned less on flashbacks. They could have relied on the leading lady to convey the loss she feels rather than reusing the same flashback scene over and over. The script lacks emotional depth and consists mostly of exposition being traded between characters.The VerdictI don't recommend seeing ""The Rhythm Section"". While it has a strong lead performance, the character and her story are never fleshed out, creating a rather empty experience. The film does offer a unique take on the femme fatale genre, but that's not enough to hold it up. The film is overlong and rather dull. Despite an intriguing start it never goes anywhere, and there's not much fun along the way to make up for it's lacking. It unravels into near-incoherence by the end, at which point you won't really care. You'll just wish you saw ""1917"" again. I wouldn't worry about seeing this one, even on Netflix.",The Rhythm Section
340,thulethompson,enjoyed it,8,1 February 2020,"This is one of those movies where the rating seems way off? Maybe its low because it's not a Marvel or Stan Lee production? I really enjoyed it.

346,privatepineapple,A Smoldering Examination of Death,7,30 April 2020,"Blake Lively delivers her career performance in this smoldering, intentionally unsatisfying examination of the doom that death places on our lives, and the struggle of dealing with that grief.

Don't go into this expecting an action romp and you won't be disappointed.SPOILERS BELOW

Had the story been told better, to bring the viewer into the story, instead of leaving the viewer to always try and figure out what just happened and why, in between turning the volume up and down because the music is way to loud compared to the dialog.

I enjoyed that it was a realistic take on how an amateur would deal with her first task. I love the John Wick franchise but Stephanie is no Wick, this world is new to her, she only seeks revenge and can't control her emotions. She was imperfect, she made mistakes. Maybe that's the reason it had less action than some expected. It was more about preparation and determination. Unfortunatelly people have gotten used too much to the image of a perfectly skilled assassin that they couldn't tolerate an imperfect amateur. Shame there won't be a sequel so we'd see how she'd evolve.

The only reason I watched it was because I am a huge Blake Lively fan; if it had been any other actress, the trailer would have made me pass it up because it was a very poorly done trailer. No offense.
To get to the point, Blake is absolutely amazing in this movie. It is not your typical spy movie where a nobody becomes a badass overnight; it is a story of a troubled young woman who tries to get justice for the death of her family and will work as hard as it takes to make that happen.
It is raw and realistic and those are qualities that might turn people off.
Blake Lively is an absolutely stunning person in the real world, and to see her wearing boyish, unflattering clothing and making you believe she is the character she is playing is truly fantastic. She has grown so much as an actress and if it weren't for this bloody pandemic, I think this movie would have gotten more recognition.",The Rhythm Section

What added to this largely slow boring movie was the sound and speech. It went so low several times you had to rewind and listen to critical parts. Then you had to turn it back down for other particularly loud parts. Automatic 3 in my book. By the end there was some more talk that was incomprehensible and pretty much relied on you knowing what was said somewhere else in the movie in order to make sense of what was said at the end. I truly thought it was the worse movie I had ever seen and the two people I watched it with agreed. Note my opinion had nothing to do with the acting.
