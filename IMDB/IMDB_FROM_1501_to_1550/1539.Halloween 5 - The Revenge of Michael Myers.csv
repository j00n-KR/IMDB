0,TheLittleSongbird,A revenge that is neither scary or thrilling,3,15 January 2018,"John Carpenter's 1978 'Halloween' is wholly deserving of its status as a horror classic. To this day it's still one of the freakiest films personally seen and introduced the world to one of horror's most iconic villainous characters Michael Myers.Which is why it is such a shame that not only are all of the sequels nowhere near as good but that the decline in quality is so drastic. Ok, the original 'Halloween' is very difficult to follow on from, but most of the sequels could at least looked like effort was made into them. To me, and many others it seems, 'Halloween 5' is one of the worst of the series. Even with its attempt at a grittier tone, it is far from a thrill ride and there is very little scary about it, other than one scene and how poor quality the film is.Danielle Harris and Don Shanks give strong performances, as does Ellie Cornell in the limited screen time she has. Donald Pleasance does his best and succeeds in creating an unnerving presence, but his character is now too much of a caricature which is at the writers' door not his. There is one effective scene, that with the laundry chute which is actually pretty freaky. The setting has a haunting eeriness when it is not hindered by the low-budget-looking rushed-looking filming.Sadly, most of the time it is with the editing being especially amateurish. The direction is also sloppy, especially in the dramatically inept non-horror scenes. The music is here a drawback when it was one of the better elements of the three previous sequels. Here it sounds cheap, goofy and would have sounded out of date even in the 80s most likely.'Halloween 5' is also seriously lacking in atmosphere and the darkness and grittiness doesn't come through enough because too much of the film is dull and descends into overly-silly camp. Again, 'Halloween 5' feels more of the same, the chilling scares, nail-biting suspense and the feeling of being unsettled. There is nothing creative or shocking about the scares or deaths, it's all by-the-numbers, over-familiar and indifferent. Everything is just too predictable and dull in pace to be remotely suspenseful. Stupidity is also all over the film. So many moments are intelligence-insultingly ridiculous and almost illogical. The characters mostly are very bland and annoying, especially Tina. High quality of acting and dialogue is never to be expected in a 'Halloween' film, but both are especially bad here. The script is so last-minute sounding and not even half-baked and outside of the aforementioned the acting is terrible.In summary, one of the worst of the series. Scary and thrilling are the two last words to describe this revenge. 3/10 Bethany Cox",Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers
1,Leofwine_draca,"Worst of the Halloween films, a sequel devoid of any entertainment value",2,25 July 2016,"Boring, pointless and totally inept, this is a classic example of everything that was wrong with the late '80s horror film. It's difficult to imagine a film that would make HALLOWEEN 4 seem like a masterpiece, but this does just that. There is no plot in this film - no new twists or turns to add to the series. After some minimal character building, it's just endless stalk-and-slash scenarios which quickly become boring. There's nothing here we haven't seen before, so don't go looking for originality.Here, we're about a million miles away from the original scary classic. This film couldn't be scary if tried, and it never does try. It's happy to rehash all of the old slashing previously seen in the earlier films and simply trade on Myers' already familiar image, plus the original, now watered-down, score. Myers is seen driving a car all over the place, also swapping his trademark white mask for a rubber Halloween one instead, somehow losing his image in the process.The cast is populated by an incredibly annoying bunch of stupid teenagers who you'll want to die as violently as possible. It's true, I've never seen actors and actresses as bad as this, playing such inane characters. The only saving grace is a hammy Donald Pleasence wandering around chewing the scenery, which is something I suppose. Without him, this would be the worst film ever made. With him, it's just really bad instead, although the final confrontation between Myers and an overacting Pleasence is quite fun.To add salt to the wound, there isn't even any standout gore to speak of. The deaths are dealt with quickly and efficiently, the blood kept to a minimum. Myers uses a pitchfork as a second weapon to his trusty knife but even the full potential of this nasty weapon isn't exploited. The final 30 minutes are a protracted stalking sequence with Myers attempting to kill the (annoying) little girl and repeatedly being thwarted or apparently killed, only to come back for another try, and another, and another. It'll send you to sleep. Whoever thought it would be a good idea to throw in a sub-plot about a mysterious caped stranger was also sorely misled too - his identity is never explained, making this dull movie even more frustrating. I wouldn't wish this piece of worthless trash on my worst enemy, so don't bother sitting through it.",Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers
2,SnoopyStyle,turns into a mess,3,24 October 2013,"One year after Halloween 4, Michael Myers is still alive and killing. Jamie Lloyd (Danielle Harris) is living in a children's hospital after stabbing her stepmother. She is now mute and finds that she's linked with Myers. Rachel Carruthers (Ellie Cornell) and Dr. Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasence) are trying to help the disturbed child.Donald Pleasence is going overboard with the hysterical acting. Danielle Harris is now almost exclusively crying or otherwise in a dire state. It's a disappointment considering that Halloween 4 ended with her turning evil. It could have been a great turn for the franchise. And turning her mute really restricts her effectiveness as a character.The first kill with Ellie Cornell is quite effective. She's in a skimpy towel. It has a nice build up. But you know it's going to be a bad movie when they play that silly 'comedic' music for the two cops ogling Ellie. Nevertheless Ellie's kill is great, but it all goes down hill from there. And the ending is way too messy.",Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers
3,gavin6942,The Cusp Between Good and Bad Halloween,6,9 November 2010,"The Halloween saga continues...Mike Mayo simply gives this film another ""Woof!"" indicating his dismissal of it. I think it deserves a bit more reflection than that.For example, the laundry chute scene is amazingly terrifying. In the infamous laundry chute scene, Jamie was originally stabbed in the leg but the shot was cut from the film by the MPAA because it was deemed ""too disturbing"". Putting this back in would make the film even more nasty.The real problem is the Man in Black who is not properly identified, and although playing an important role does not come to fruition until part six. The writers did not know his identity, and they couldn't cast an actor to play him because they didn't know who he was. That's just a bad idea, creating a huge subplot that you don't even know about. That, of course, forced them make part six, which is a pile of steaming trash.",Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers
4,lee_eisenberg,5 and onward,7,29 May 2006,"Once again, Michael Myers comes back and goes around killing people. The whole thing about the mental connection with Jamie made this one slightly more interesting. Of course, the character most likely to stick in your mind is Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasance); sometimes, I wonder why he didn't just call up the FBI, CIA, etc. to help him catch Michael.All in all, ""Halloween 5"" is nothing particularly special, but always fun to watch. Still, the series got really good again with the seventh installment (when Jamie Lee Curtis returned).Hoo hoo hoo hoo ha ha ha ha...",Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers
5,jboothmillard,Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers,3,2 November 2010,"This was apparently shot back to back with the previous film, and that is hardly surprising, it is exactly the same quality, but at least it sticks with the same storyline unlike film three. Basically the opening reminds of the previous events, where Michael Myers (Don Shanks) is shot and falls into a mine shaft, and we see that he fell into water below and made his way down the river to return. You may also remember that Michael's niece, daughter of the supposedly dead Laurie Strode, nine year old Jamie Lloyd (Danielle Harris) murdered her step-mother in little Michael style in that clown costume. So it has been a year since all this happened, and Jamie is now in Haddonfield's Children's Hospital under supervision headed by Dr. Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasence). Aided by Jamie's step-sister Rachel Carruthers (Ellie Cornell) and her friend Tina Williams (Wendy Foxworth/Kaplan) they look after the little girl, who hasn't said a word since Michael apparently made her do the killing. Since then she has gained a mind-link with her uncle, so whenever he is about to murder, or during, she senses it, making Loomis very agitated to find the psycho. Michael plans to catch Jamie this time by killing Rachel and Tina at the big Halloween night costume contest with party, and obviously her sense will make her go after them. After Michael is successful killing the two women, and a few others, Loomis plans to lure the killer into the old house in Haddonfield with Jamie as bait. In the end, after failing to kill both Loomis and Jamie, Michael is finally caught and put in a prison cell, but escapes when a mysterious man in black helps him break out. Also starring Beau Starr as Sheriff Ben Meeker. Myers may look a little less menacing with a slightly different mask, but he is still very creepy, Pleasance is a little repetitive with his dialogue but still good to watch, and the death count and methods are a little better. The middle Halloween party section slows things down, really annoying, but it picks up again inside the Myers house, especially with Jamie trapped in the laundry chute, apart from that, another silly horror sequel. Adequate!",Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers
6,Woodyanders,So-so entry in the series,5,19 March 2013,"Jamie Lloyd (an excellent performance by Danielle Harris) has developed a psychic bond with her evil uncle Michael Myers (hulking Don Shanks), who wakes up from a year long coma and returns to Haddonfield once again to finish Jamie off. Can Dr. Loomis (a delightfully batty Donald Pleasence) figure out a way to stop Myers once and for all? Director Dominique Othenin-Girard, who also co-wrote the sloppy script with Michael Jacobs and Shem Bitterman, manages to generate some tension and pulls off a few effectively harrowing set pieces (the laundry chute sequence is a real nail-biter), but the off-putting emphasis on graphic gore, unlikable teen characters (Wendy Kaplan in particular as the obnoxiously giddy and kooky Tina grates on the nerves something fierce), two annoying comic relief deputies, the general lack of spooky atmosphere, a dumb subplot about a mysterious stranger in cowboy hat and boots who has some kind of odd connection with Myers, and the frustratingly inconclusive sequel set-up ending doom this one to outright mediocrity. That said, Othenin-Girard warrants some praise for the pervasive dark tone and take-no-prisoners attitude; the scene where Jamie's sweet stepsister Rachel (the appealing Ellie Cornell) gets brutally murdered by Myers is genuinely shocking and tragic. Beau Starr does well as the hard-nosed Sheriff Meeker while familiar character actor Troy Evans has a nice minor part as the amiable Deputy Charlie. Alan Howarth's shivery score offers a few nifty jazzed-up variations on John Carpenter's classic theme. Robert Draper's polished cinematography gives the picture an impressive stylish look. Strictly okay, with a few decent moments and remarkable acting by Harris (who plays her character as mute for the first half of the movie), but it could (and should) have been much better.",Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers
7,BA_Harrison,The Halloween series experiences a serious drop in quality.,3,9 September 2014,"Following on immediately from Halloween Part 4, which left stabby psycho Michael Myers presumably crushed by a cave-in, Halloween 5 shows the masked maniac escaping death once again by crawling through a handy tunnel to a river, where he is washed downstream to be found and cared for by a mountain man. One year later, Michael's niece Jamie Lloyd (Danielle Harris) is recovering from her ordeal in a children's home and Michael is fighting fit and ready for more random slaughter. After snapping the neck of the old man who has nursed him back to health, Michael heads for Haddonfield once again to seek out his niece.After her impressive turn as Jamie in Part 4 (The Return of Michael Myers), child-star Danielle Harris disappoints with Part 5, putting in a lousy performance, her incessant wailing and screeching really grating on the nerves. She's not alone, though: Wendy Foxworth as her hyperactive teen stepsister is equally as annoying, her character never shutting up (at least until she gets a knife in her!). Even Donald Pleasance manages to irritate, his crazy Dr. Loomis character now bordering on parody.The crap acting might not have mattered so much had director Dominique Othenin-Girardat at least succeeded in delivering some decent scares and gory killings, but her handling of the material is awful: there's very little in the way of tension or atmosphere (the shadowy figure of Michael lurking out of focus in the background of every shot soon becomes laughable), and the splatter is poor, with every death being weak and gutless (it's hard to believe the make-up FX are by KNB, whose gruesome work is often the highlight of many a horror film). Worse still are the bumbling cops, whose antics are accompanied by comedy musical effects that beggar belief, and a lousy new rendition of John Carpenter's classic score will annoy fans of the original.Still, as bad as this film is, I guess it's no worse than Rob Zombie's terrible remakes (which also star Danielle Harris, only as a completely different character).",Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers
8,Quinoa1984,Part 4,5,18 July 2000,This film is technically part 4 because part 3 was just a remake of (The Day the Earth Stood Still) some movie or other.  Better to watch this before part 6 (or so its called) but definitely not a watchable horror film. Unless your a big horror/Pleasence fan.  B-,Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers
9,Coventry,When Mickey Comes Marching Home,3,9 December 2007,"This is the fifth entry in the Halloween franchise and arguably the very worst one ever written, and that includes Rob Zombies's disappointing remake of the original, released earlier this year. It's also the last film in the series the producers bothered to number! After this film the following sequels simply received additional titles, presumably just to mislead people in video stores and trick them into blindly renting their lousy films. Anyways, the ""Halloween"" formula is dreadfully exploited to the fullest here, with killing sequences that look like boring routine work and even Dr. Loomis' character hasn't got a single interesting thing to say. He's actually just a miserable and pathetic caricature in this installment; a fatigue old copper who yells at mute kids and doesn't contribute at all in the capture of Michael Myers. The opening sequence is a flashback showing sneaky mass murderer Myers escaping from the pit he was thrown in at the end of part four and finding shelter in the primitive house of a random hermit. Around the 31st of October the year after, he returns to home sweet home Haddonfield where he still intends to kill the little niece with whom he has a telepathic link. And of course to make the whole thing a little bit more interesting, there's a new shipment of dumb coppers and horny teenagers volunteering to serve as extra body count. The script actually ignores the entire climax shot of the previous film, which suggested that Michael's incontrollable murderous tendencies shifted into young Jamie. This idea could have led to entirely new possibilities for the franchise, but all of a sudden Jamie is a cherubic and ""average"" child again. Michael Myers acts truly bizarre in this film as well. We're used to knowing him as the straightforward psychopath, but here he actually toys with his victims and even allows them to escape from his knife. How very weird ""Halloween 5"" is mainly dull and low on suspense, but at least the last half hour contains some excitement and bloody make-up effects. Danielle Harris, who played Jamie in parts four and five, returned in Zombie's remake of the original as one of Laurie Strode's teenage friends. She as well as Ellie Cornell rank among the most talented actresses of the entire film series.",Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers
10,michaelRokeefe,The town's infamous bad boy returns home.,3,26 October 2002,"More or less a disappointing continuance of the Halloween saga. It has been a year since Michael Myers somehow survived massive gunfire and falling down a mine shaft. Upon healing his wounds he once again returns home to seek out his niece Jamie(Danielle Harris), who now herself is hospitalized and telepathic...knowing when the slasher is about to attack. Donald Pleasence, Ellie Cornell and Beau Starr reprise their previous roles. Also notable are Wendy Kaplan and Tamara Glynn. It is hard to tell if there are more squeals than thrills. My main complaint is they kill off Rachel(Cornell)way too quickly. Miss Harris is left with the most serious acting and does very well. This time it is Don Shanks playing the maniacal white masked menace. The finale is quite brutal, but is it brutal enough?",Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers
11,hitchcockthelegend,You've got to help me Jamie. You've got to help me find him. We both know he's alive.,5,26 October 2015,"Halloween 5: The Return of Michael Myers picks up where part 4 left off, only Michael is not dead, obviously! He's come back to Haddonfield intent on finally killing his niece, Jamie (Danielle Harris), who due to trauma has lost the ability to speak and now has a psychic link with mad uncle Michael. Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasence) is once again on hand to be nutty and spout ominous warnings, while all other folk in Myers' way are doomed.It starts off quite promising, with shades of Frankenstein (1931) offering hope that maybe this wont be a sequel reeking of cash cow formula. Unfortunately it proves to be a false dawn, evidence that the writers were out of ideas, it lacks scares or a narrative spark to ignite suspense sequences. Harris is once again superb, Pleasence good fun as usual as he hams for all he is worth, while an extended sequence in a barn keeps fans of the series happy. It's passable fun for the slasher crowd, but ultimately it's unimaginative and a low point for the Halloween franchise. 5/10",Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers
12,Scarecrow-88,Halloween 5,6,24 October 2010,"Michael Myers reign of terror in Haddonfield continues(Part 5 is a continuation of the Jamie-niece-of-Michael saga)as he pursues his tormented niece who has been rendered a mute due to the extensive trauma she suffered a year ago when something evil forced her to attack her adoptive mother shortly after the sheriff's department gunned down the psychopath in a field. Myers falls into an old well, leaks into a lake, crawling out near the ramshackle abode of a hermit who allows him to recuperate(a hermit, with a parrot, for which perishes at Michael's hand when he awakens). Dr. Loomis, clearly as mad as any patient he might've treated in the earlier decades, will do whatever it takes to stop Myers, including his badgering of Jamie for the location of her uncle. Michael, when he isn't after Jamie, bides his time by killing teenage friends of Rachel(Ellie Cornell returning in a brief supporting part). With Beau Starr returning in a smaller role as Haddonfield sheriff, Ben Meeker, his deputies fodder for Myers to destroy. Wendy Foxworth gets a sizable part as Rachel's friend, Tina, who doesn't heed the warnings of a terrified Jamie and insistent Loomis about remaining under police protection, stressing the importance of staying out of harm's way. Of course, Tina doesn't listen and places herself in peril.Pleasence is more than a bit over the top, his Loomis practically maniacal in catching Myers, which I must admit to enjoying. Many might find him a bit overbearing, but I could understand why he had gone off the deep end. When you've been trying to stop an evil for so long as he has, it's bound to cause psychological cracks. Poor Danielle Harris' Jamie Lloyd both must endure physical and emotional hardships as the troubled tyke with a monstrous uncle who she is unfortunately linked to somehow. Jamie, in this film, can see through his eyes, feel his rage, and maybe this is why Myers wants her dead. There are some cool sequences in a barn(where Michael uses a pitchfork and scythe to kill a teenage couple in the midst of having sex) and the old Myers house where Loomis not only shoots him with multiple tranquilizer darts but pummels repeatedly with a block of wood. Michael, like in the previous film, is seemingly indestructible, a force of nature. Introduced in this film(and further elaborated in the next film of the franchise)is a mysterious ""man in black"" who seems to have an interest in Michael, even assisting to break him out of prison. The most harrowing scene could be when Jamie falls into a laundry shoot, in a tough spot, quite a claustrophobic, tightly orchestrated bit of suspense. My own personal disappointment derives from Rachel's early exit. I really like Cornell and think she could've added quality to the film. She is used to tease the audience in scenes where she showers, under a towel, as Myers looks on in different areas of her house. While she gets her name after Harris in the film, Cornell is probably in the movie about ten or so minutes tops. The Michael Myers mask no longer resembles the famous Shatner one from previous entries of the franchise.",Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers
13,Doylenf,Something went awfully wrong with this one...bad script...,5,25 October 2007,"After the success of HALLOWEEN 4, it was predictable that the studio would go on with another sequel. The only good thing about this one is that it picks up the story exactly where the last film left off, giving an explanation for the fact that little DANIELLE HARRIS is behind bars in a clinic for disturbed children. But within the first half-hour of the story, it's obvious that this is no HALLOWEEN 4.As someone else pointed out, DONALD PLEASANCE is just about as psychotic as Michael Meyers in his quest to find the serial killer who seems to be eradicating all the citizens of Haddonfield every time it's Halloween. ELLIE CORNELL as Rachel is killed off early in the story and, unfortunately, there are no other likable members among the youthful cast to root for. It's as if they were scripted, all of them, to deserve their fate.Without a good plot structure and much too much repetition, this one begins to sink before the midway point. All of the fright sequences are done competently enough but just don't have the same tension or creepiness of the better ones in this series.Summing up: Not helped by Donald Pleasance's decision to ham it up unmercifully to draw attention--but it doesn't work. They should have quit after HALLOWEEN 4.",Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers
14,poolandrews,Dull continuation of a dull series of slasher films.,3,2 July 2005,"Halloween 5 starts with a cool opening credits sequence where the cast & crew names are listed between quick shots of a knife & lots of 'whooshing' noises that eventually is revealed to have carved an evil looking face into a pumpkin accompanied by the classic Halloween theme tune, unfortunately this is the best part of Halloween 5 so enjoy it while it lasts... After the last few minutes of Halloween 4: The Return of Micheal Myers (1988) are replayed in which the seemingly indestructible killer was repeatedly shot & fell into a mine shaft, Halloween 5 then inserts it's own footage as it reveals (surprise surprise) that Myers (Don Shanks as Donald L. Shanks) isn't dead & crawls out of the shaft & into a river moments before some dynamite goes off that everyone thinks killed him. Once ashore Myers appears badly injured but comes across a wooden shack & a hermit (Harper Roisman) takes him in. The film then informs us with an on screen caption that it's 'Halloween Eve One Year Later' & that were at a 'Childrens Clinic Haddonfield, Illinois' where nine year old mute Jamie Lloyd (Danielle Harris) is being cared for by Dr. Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasence), she regularly experiences nightmares about the events of a year ago. Dr. Loomis believes that Micheal is still alive & tries to use Jamie who seems to have some sort of psychic link with her Brother to locate him. Jamie's stepsister Rachel Carruthers (Ellie Cornell) is brutally murdered by Myers as he has yet again returned to kill his sister Jamie. Myers also thinks it might be fun to kill a few random teenagers such as Jamie's friend Tina Williams (Wendy Kaplan), her boyfriend Mikey (Jonathan Chapin) & a whole group of Halloween party-goers who make for easy prey. But Myers wants Jamie & Loomis wants Myers as yet again more blood will be spilt before Halloween night is over in Haddonfield...Co-written & directed by the Swiss Dominique Othenin-Girard I thought Halloween 5 was a pretty lame film that is nothing new or particularly exciting. I've never been a fan of Halloween (1978) or it's sequels & Halloween 5 did nothing to change my attitude towards them. The script by Othenin-Girard, Shem Bitterman & Micheal Jocobs is slow, predictable, littered with annoying clichéd characters & situations & offers nothing that just about any other cheap slasher could & since it apparently cost $5,000,000 to make, which seems quite a lot to me, I wonder just where that money went. Othenin-Girard fails to create any tension during the lame chase & kill scenes, there is no atmosphere whatsoever & the overall storyline is basically exactly the same as the previous instalment Halloween 4: The Return of Micheal Myers isn't it? The expected clichés are here, annoying teenagers playing pranks on each other which Othenin-Girard seems to think is both clever & scary, Dominique mate it isn't OK? Stereotypical characters, the horny teens, the bumbling police officers & the victim, or hero depending on your viewpoint, who the killer never manages to kill even though they have plenty of opportunity. The mystery 'man in black' character who is never seen, snazzy boots apart, is just pointless & the ending which is their only real involvement in the film is predictably bad in a 80's sequel driven sort of way which turned up six years later as Halloween: The Curse of Micheal Myers (1995). To be honest I found myself struggling to keep my eyes open & stay awake as Halloween 5 provides little in the way of entertainment during it's 96 dull minute duration. Oh, & how can a nine year old out run a car for five minutes straight? The kills & gore are disappointing, the kills are almost totally bloodless even when a guy has a metal claw thing planted in their forehead there isn't a single drop of blood. The (almost) double impalement of two teenagers having sex is obviously ripped off from Friday the 13th Part 2 (1981) & is nowhere near as effective. I can't actually think of anymore kills other than those. Halloween 5 looks quite nice as I would expect from a film with a reasonable budget & very limited aspirations & director Othenin-Girard likes to keep his camera moving which gives it a nice free flowing look & feel. The acting was average at best but young Danielle Harris was quite good I suppose, Pleasence is his usual deadly serious self. I really didn't think much of Halloween 5 at all, it's dull, it's really slow with many scenes lasting far longer than they should & Halloween 5 could have been cut down by 10 or 15 minutes easily which would probably have helped, then again on reflection it probably wouldn't have as it would still have been boring. Opening credit sequence apart this one sucks, there are many better slasher films out there so there's no excuse for having to bother with this.",Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers
15,Bunuel1976,"HALLOWEEN 5 (Dominique Othenin-Girard, 1989) *1/2",2,29 October 2007,"I had intended to check this out prior to viewing the remake of the original; however, it wasn't available for rental at the time. Now that I've caught up with it, I'm only left with Part 6 of the series to catch up with. I recall liking HALLOWEEN 4: THE RETURN OF MICHAEL MYERS (1988) well enough (unfortunately, I lost my reviews for Parts 1, 2 and 4 along with a few others because my computer hard-disk has recently died on me!) – but this takes the franchise back to the mediocrity prevalent in the disappointing second instalment!! Anyway, the opening shamelessly rips off BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN (1935) with Michael Myers shown to have survived his apparent demise at the end of the previous film; what's stupid, however, is that he should wait a whole year (i.e. the next Halloween) before going after his niece – what the hell is he up to the rest of the year? Donald Pleasence returns as Dr. Loomis: I don't recall how his character behaved in Part 4, but here he's rather hysterical and unsympathetic; interestingly, his eventual demise is strikingly similar to Malcolm McDowell's counterpart in the current version! Even if it came out of nowhere, the possession by Myers of his little niece at the end of Part 4 was an inspired touch; here, however, she reverts to being afraid of him (besides having gone speechless following a murder she herself committed!) – though still telekinetically connected to The Shape, The Boogeyman, or whatever you wish to call him. The teenagers in this installment are among the most boring ever seen in the slasher subgenre – with the heroine (for whom the audience is supposed to root) being especially resistible! Two days after watching the thing I can hardly remember a scene/slaying I could reasonably call a highlight – including the climax; what I can't forget is the padded (and idiotic) footage involving the so-called Man In Black whose character was, reportedly, fleshed out (and his identity revealed) in Part 6...",Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers
16,utgard14,These Mystery Boots Are Made For Walkin',3,4 November 2013,"Awful sequel. When it's not borrowing from other films (Bride of Frankenstein, The Eyes of Laura Mars), it's outright ripping them off (Friday the 13th Part 2). There's not a suspenseful or scary moment in the whole movie. Every new character is unlikeable. One of the somewhat likable characters from part 4 is killed off early and needlessly. Danielle Harris improves from the last film but spends a significant portion of the movie unable to speak. So take that for what it's worth. Donald Pleasence, the saving grace of most of these films, is here reduced to full-blown caricature. Still he tries to elevate the material by treating it seriously. Points for trying but it's a lost cause. Oh and the two bumbling comic relief cops: what were they thinking with that? There's even goofy sound effects the first time they show up. Moronic.Another annoying thing are the constant red herring jumps. You know, where they lead you to believe Michael is about to attack someone, only to have it turn out to be a janitor or somebody's boyfriend acting like an ass. This movie is full of those cheap tricks. It gets old fast.Then there's the mystery character. Throughout the movie we get glimpses of him and his steel-tipped cowboy boots. He even helps Michael in the film's climax. We NEVER find out who he is. It's laughable. What a mess of a movie. Incompetently scripted and crudely directed. This is easily the worst of the series.",Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers
17,Boba_Fett1138,Simply not much good as an horror.,4,20 September 2009,"Well, this movie is a pretty messy one to watch. Things seem to happen very randomly and there hardly is a good main plot-line it follows. It's just the one even after the other, without making an obvious connection and contribution.Perhaps they though it would be enough simply showing Michael Myers killing a whole bunch of people again. The movie and its killings hardly ever become interesting though. As an horror this movie is just picking a wrong approach with its story and build-up. As shame, since before this movie the series still showed some class and were simply god movies within its genre to watch. With this movie things start to go terribly wrong. The also decided to try out some new things, by adding in some comical characters and to make the Myers characters more of a supernatural one but things simply never get developed well enough to let it all work out though.The movie basically starts of were part 4 had ended and the movie pretty much also features the same characters in it. It got shot back to back with ""Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers"", with as a big difference though that they started on this movie without a complete script. Surely it was done for budgeting reasons but this 5th part surely doesn't benefits from it.Halve of the time the movie consists out of killing, while the other halve remains pretty much boring to watch. Especially toward its ending the movie tends to get worse to watch, when absolutely nothing good or interesting is happening. It relies mostly on Dr. Loomis' babbling, which was still a good thing to watch in the previous movies but in this movie his character just doesn't work out quite as well.Oh well, it still is a pleasure to watch Donald Pleasance though, so it can't be really said that's his fault really. At least his character is still better and more compelling than any of the other characters within this movie, which often come across as ones that add very little to the actual movie, who get killed very randomly and without apparent reason.

Uncle Michael is so creepy,5,2 February 2010,"After surviving the end of the previous entry in the series(I know; who could have seen that coming?), Myers stumbles away, coming upon a old dude. Electing to leave him alone for the time being, he instead collapses and then proceeds to nap for about 364 days. Yeah. I guess those night-long killing sprees really take it out of you. I mean, sure, he only does this once a decade or so, but he's not exactly the sporty type. Anyway, he wakes back up(internal timers are extremely handy for those apparently somehow unable to take a life any other day of the year than either the 30th or 31st of October; I wonder how well it handles leap-years, though?), and so proceeds this poorly plotted mess. So, this largely abandons the very ending of the one immediately before it, in spite of it being a decent idea. Oh, don't worry, they do add a ""twist"" to it; Jamie's got a psychic connection(one that kicks in when the story demands it to, to boot) with him now. As this is causing me physical pain and probably quite a bit of internal bleeding simply to actually write this out, I will move on to another aspect of it. Harris also has to play a mute, and she's joined by a boy who appears to have a speech impediment or similar, and they are both very impressive, and handle that strain on their talent rather well. Heck, her and Rachel now manage to not be irritating. Unfortunately, others pick up that slack(and the aforementioned three are about the only people in this who can act, or do in this, at least), and frankly, the sheer thought of the volume of obnoxious characters in this brings that stabbing sensation back... oh, Pleasance dials down the yelling of his lines, if his speeches continue to reiterate what he said once or twice(perfectly, at that) in the original one. What happened to the house? That is clearly not the same as in the first. The effects are nicely done. This hides MM better than the last two sequels that had him. The editing and cinematography are reasonable. Huh. This... I mean, it doesn't sound as bad as I remembered it, from just having watched it. Oh wait... those hideous, face-palm-inducing damn *cartoon SFX* for the cops to ""lighten it"", the noticeably awful dubbing at several points, the numerous cheap scares that don't pay off... oh, crap, I lost all feeling in the left side of my body. I'm gonna have to finish this fast. There is plenty of brutal, bloody, gory violence, relatively frequent moderate to strong language, a little graphic sexuality and brief gratuitous nudity. The DVD contains trailers for this and 4. I recommend this solely to those who want 90 minutes of a slasher, and they'd prefer it to be this particular franchise. 5/10",Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers
19,view_and_review,Takes Another Step Down,4,3 September 2020,"We start part 5 where we left off in part 4. Michael is shot so much he falls into a hole in the earth in a cemetery. Of course, Michael isn't dead, he crawled out of the hole and escaped via a river. The movie then jumps forward one year later, Michael is recovering from his wounds in a man's shack and his young niece, Jamie (Danielle Harris), is now being kept in Haddonfield Children's Clinic. She has some psychologically induced inability to talk. What more, she has some sort of a psychic connection to Michael Myers.If part 4 was weak, then part 5 was weaker. It's a continuation of the weak plot of part 4. Dr. Loomis' (Donald Pleasance) antics have worn thin. His prophetic rantings of doom could wear on anyone's nerves. I suppose that's how people are feeling about the rantings about the dangers of COVID-19. And Jamie is simply exhausting with her episodes that supposedly portend violence at the hands of Michael. Furthermore, they dragged the movie on longer than they needed to with empty jump scares. I think one scene was five full minutes of fake outs!They decided to wrap this one up by using Jamie as bait. What law enforcement organization uses a little girl as bait is beyond me. At least Dr. Loomis realized that he couldn't kill Michael and just opted to capture him and have him locked up for life. Then, for some unknown reason, they had this mysterious figure barge into the police station and shoot it up to free Michael. I guess I'll find out the answer to that in part 6.",Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers
20,Uriah43,Quite Tedious at Times,3,31 October 2018,"This film essentially begins where its predecessor left off with ""Michael Myers"" (Don Shanks) having been shot several times and then falling down into a deep mine shaft. Just prior to that, however, Michael touches a young girl named ""Jamie"" (Danielle Harris) who then goes home and proceeds to don a Halloween mask and stab her step-mother in a similar manner to Michael when he was about that age. From that point the film takes up one year later with Jamie having been incarcerated in a mental hospital and rendered mute and with a psychic ability of sorts. Additionally, the scene involving Michael is further expounded upon to show that, although he had been severely wounded, he managed to escape and find sanctuary with a hermit living out in the middle of the woods. And it is now one year later with Michael back in Haddonfield, Illinois looking for ""Rachel"" (Ellie Cornell) and Jamie-on Halloween. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that I don't consider this film to be nearly as good as any of the preceeding films in the series due in large part to the manner in which the director (Dominique Otherin-Girard) kept repeating similar scenes over and over again. Likewise, some of the chase scenes went on much too long as well. Quite frankly, it became quite tedious at times and for that reason I have rated this film accordingly. Below average.",Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers
21,kannibalcorpsegrinder,Pretty decent but still with some flaws,7,24 July 2012,"Learning he never died following his previous encounter, Loomis again sets off after Michael who continues his remorseless assault on his long-hidden relative, now driven insane following his earlier encounter with the family.This one was far better than it really deserves to be and manages to come across as rather decent overall entry in the series. One of the best parts is that this is one of the few movies in the series that actually concerns itself with continuity, as the continuity between this and the previous entry starts right off the bat with the last parts of the previous film then carrying on the psychological effects onto this one, is a nice change of pace. The decision to now make Jaime psychically linked with Myers, which now renders her mute and in a nut- house for children, is pretty creative and a nice change of pace. The fear Myers instills in her is also creatively played out in several key scenes, including when she runs through the hospital from what she thinks is Myers down into the basement where a thrilling chase through the laundry before a fantastic revelation and when she comes out of her mute state as Myers is about to murder a friend and warns the police about Myers while in the middle of a pageant with her friends as the incident described is taking place with the oblivious friend, making for a rather fun time to be had. There are also a bit more traditional slashing elements to be found here, from the hospital chase in the opening through the long, twisting hallways, the encounter behind a grocery store, a stalking sequence at a party held in a barn that works well despite going on for three or four false-scares too long and the corn-field car-chase through the hay field as he stalks her friend through the hazy field in his car that work rather well as big action scenes and were all great parts that kept a lively pace. Indeed, these set the stage for the big trap for Myers in his house at the end to be a really enjoyable highlight that's overwhelmingly exciting and played out logically, from the police set-up and eventual diversion, the brawl with Loomis and stalking off through the house and down into the basement as the entire air duct sequence is utterly chilling coming close as he does on several occasions and the conclusion trap was done nicely. Along with the great body count, these positives manage to overcome the several flaws in here. The biggest issue with this one comes from the fact that Michael here really comes off as a total joke at time. It seems like he's supposed to be scary simply because it's him, as the sinister walk and threatening mannerisms are gone while for once the mask is a just a total, complete disaster here as the frizzy hair sticks out badly and the flaps around the neck don't cover him properly so it seems the mask doesn't fit properly, all of which manage to give him a goofy look but really robs him of his intimidation considerably. Also, they should have cut the scene when Jaime is confronting 'Uncle' Myers in the attic where Michael shows a tender side to himself by dropping his knife and taking off his mask, as even the tear was uncharacteristic and then he allows her to get close to wipe the tear away. Though it redeems itself as he went in a rage and went after her again that was true Michael Myers instead of those other two scenes, it's all about the tender side of Michael on display, which shouldn't have been there. The other flaw here is the absolutely ridiculous and protracted scene in the barn- house. After several minutes of watching these two teenagers try to scare each other by dressing as Michael Myers and stalking the other, it's quite fun then whenever it should've Myers, they pull the mask off to reveal the other and after the third false revelation they kept pulling the same stunt it's just too much and didn't care when the real Myers appeared. Otherwise, this one was quite fun.Rated R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, Brief Nudity and several sex scenes.",Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers

Dr. Sam Loomis has realised this, and plans to use it to finally put an end to Michael's rage. But unbeknown to them, a stranger has come to Haddonfield, and he is a key factor in the outcome of the madness that has plagued Haddonfield on Halloween for over ten years......The fourth movie wasn't much cop, but it had the element of Myers returning for a Halloween sequel, much like Diesel returning for the Fast and Furious franchise, but while those movies are trashy fun, this one looks so messed up for some reason.You get the feeling that so Many people messed around With the film, because half of the time, it really makes no sense, unless you watch the sixth installment. I mean who on earth was the man in black, and why did he release Myers from Jail? All will be revealed if you see the next one, which is even worse.On the plus side, Harris is great in her role, and there are one or two decent bits, but otherwise, there are time in the film where if you listen very carefully, you can hear Carpenter banging his head against the wall.A wasted idea, really dull, and almost incomprehensible....",Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers
24,Aaron1375,"Hey, Johnny Cash is in town!!!",3,6 November 2003,"This movie picks up somewhat from where the last one left off and it is not very good.  Myers having endured the shotgun barrage is found by a dude living in a shack.  For some reason he keeps Myers a whole year in an unconscious state and when Halloween comes about Myers shows his appreciation by killing the guy who deserved to die for letting Myers stay there without reporting it.  He once again goes after his niece who is still annoying, but thankfully at the beginning of this one she can't talk.  We are introduced to the sister again and this friend who we have never seen before, but apparently means more to the little girl than her sister.  The girl is connected to Myers somehow and throws fits whenever he is about to kill.  Unfortunately, this fits save no one as after the person is warned they get away, decide there is no danger and get killed.  On the plus side we get to see this real jerk get killed.  Myers scratches his car then kills him, it was sweet.  Another scene has the gal we have never seen, but means so much to the little girl get saved by the police, but then she just has to go see her jerk boyfriend.  Typical gal, everyone says don't go, but they do.  The last part of the film has Pleasance using the girl as bait to capture Myers.  The most absurd part of the movie comes here as Myers takes off his mask and reveals no scars from the fire that engulfed him.  And what is with the tear on Myers cheek...that was quite lame.  How Myers gets defeated in this one is laughable too, considering he survived that shotgun attack and being totally consumed in flames.  On the plus side this movie did give Donald another movie he could headline.  And I just have to mention this, but all through the movie you see the feet of this guy.  All you see is black boots and a black long coat.  That is where the Cash reference came in.  I have no idea who is, I think it is explained in part six, but I missed that one.",Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers
25,Wuchakk,Michael Myers attacks trick-or-treaters on Halloween,7,16 August 2018,"Michael Myers survives his descent into a mind shaft from the previous movie and holds up with a hermit for a year before returning to his hometown in Illinois to attack his niece during Halloween and any trick-or-treaters who get in the way. As usual, Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasence) is on his trail.""Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers"" (1989) has the best sense of Halloween up to this point in the Michael Myers story arc with a considerable amount of the runtime involving the entertaining shenanigans of trick-or-treaters. While it's not great like the previous entry it's pretty much on par with the original 1978 movie and I actually prefer it even though it's less classy/arty and more blunt. Remember the infamous closet scene in the original? This one has a similarly effective sequence revolving around a clothes chute and Jaimie Lloyd.Ellie Cornell returns from the previous movie as Rachel and looks better, but it's charismatic raven-haired Wendy Foxworth as Tina who's the main protagonist (aside from Jaimie, that is) with blonde Tamara Glynn offering support as Samantha. There's also a Fonzie wannabe and his bud.This is the first movie in the series to throw in a little camp and comic booky-ness like the ""Friday the 13th"" franchise did with ""Part III"" (1982) and subsequent installments. The campiness has to do with the two goofy deputies and the comic booky-ness relates to the mysterious man-in-black and the corresponding twist at the end, which is supposed to segue into ""Halloween 6: The Curse of Michael Myers"" (1995). Like ""Friday the 13th Part III,"" there's a long sequence involving a similar-looking barn.As with ""Halloween 4,"" the movie was shot in the greater Salt Lake City area, Utah.GRADE: B",Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers
26,trashgang,we go further away from the actual story,5,16 November 2011,"1989, just a year later after part 4 producer Moustapha Akkad was ready to deliver the next part, The Revenge Of Michael Myers. The hype surrounding Freddy and Jason was dying, in fact, the whole slasher scene was finished. But the craziness about Myers was still going on. But just having a year between part 4 and 5 everybody thought that the story would becoming better, sadly it didn't and it had a bad box office reception and fans left with a bitter feeling. It took 6 years before part 6 was made.Why did many people hated it, well, if you just see were Michael is coming from here he suddenly is driving a car. Can it goes a bit weirder? It starts off were part 4 stopped and it all goes pretty well when Michael finds a way out of the mine shaft. He is searching for a way to get back to Haddonfield. Dr Loomis (Donald Pleasence) is becoming mad to track Myers down but it's again the acting of Danielle Harris that saved the day. She is giving an excellent performance. The killings aren't original anymore and you have seen it all before. Michael is just standing there with his knife in dark passages like we have seen so many times before. Also they left out some nudity and gore so it's low on everything a slasher needs. You only see the result of his killings, now and then you actually see the killing itself. Still, it feels like a Halloween flick and it's much better then the Friday series or even Freddy who became a joke of himself. But the big let down was the mystery man with boots. Nothing is said about him or even revealed but at the end he's very important for Michael. Some couldn't take the part were Michael puts off his mask because his niece is asking it, he even shows a tear. The mystery of Michael has gone with this flick and it just didn't evolve in storyline. You don't have any affection towards the names, Laurie Strode was gone...and John Carpenter was gone, no writing, directing, or even ghost directing or producing.

27,Smells_Like_Cheese,Not my favorite Halloween flick,5,26 July 2005,"Halloween 5, yeah, this was a disappointment, most fans don't really dig this sequel which is understandable. It is kind of stupid or just plain stupid; this is the story that most horror movie sequels try to rip off, the telepathic powers that get really annoying. It seems like every horror movie sequel has to have it, Friday the 13th and Nightmare on Elm Street had it, why not include the Halloween franchise as well? Unfortunately I didn't get into it, I think because it was extremely unoriginal and not to mention that the story didn't really continue from the 4th sequel. The ending of Halloween 4 had Jamie turning evil, I guess they just totally dropped that idea which could have been great to see, instead we got a silly and typical horror story that was badly acted, edited, and directed.Michael Myers makes his way into a small shack by the river owned by a local hermit. Once there, Michael collapses and remains in a comatose state for a full year. On October 30th Michael awakens, kills the hermit, and returns to terrorize Haddonfield, where his young niece, Jamie Lloyd continues to live after nearly being killed by Michael the year before. Jamie has been mute since attacking her foster mother at the end of film 4, but exhibits signs of a telepathic link with her evil uncle. Dr. Sam Loomis realizes that this link exists, and plans to use it to put an end to Michael's reign of terror. Michael begins stalking Rachel and her friend Tina. After both are killed Jamie agrees to put herself in danger to help Loomis stop Michael for good. With Jamie's help, Loomis lures Michael back to the old Myers house. Michael makes many attempts at killing Jamie, finally getting the chance to in the attic. Jamie tries appealing to Michael's humanity by calling him ""Uncle"". Myers pauses, prompting Jamie to ask to see his face. He takes off his mask, and a lone tear runs down his face. Jamie reaches up to wipe it away, and Michael is thrown into a rage. The killer pursues Jamie, who runs into Loomis. The doctor seems to turn on the girl as he shouts for Michael to come and take her. It turns out that he has used the girl as bait, thus leading Michael to walk beneath a heavy chain net. But you have to see what happens next by watching the movie.While granted that this movie isn't the worst movie in the world, I do enjoy the Halloween sequels, I think this was a fall in the story line for the Halloween series. It really could have had a lot of potential, but since they dropped a few ideas that were presented in the previous Halloween sequel. Not to mention this is one of the rare times that I wasn't scared by Michael, he's loosing his touch no, I can't say that, please I can't say that it's the writing! It's the blasted writing! So if you wanna see the sequels, yeah, do watch it just to see the story continue, but if you are just looking for a scary movie in general, you can skip Halloween 5.5/10",Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers

Did PART 5 want to be taken seriously, perhaps? Good luck. Though a somewhat harmless piece of work (for 80's slasher fans only, not true-Myers ones), it's far from Oscars, best sequel lists or even its closest competitor's (Jason, Freddy) movies. I think they gave up by this point; where #4 was a remake, this installment was simply ridiculous in stupid little changes. They changed the recognizable Myer's home, his mask (which was supposed to be the same from #4) and the fact Jamie attached her FOSTER mother, not step-mother as this movie mistakes several times. Throw in idiot cops with an idiot ""comic theme,"" a child who brutally attacked someone but resides in an extreme-minimal security clinic, Pleasence, who should've been absolutely embarrassed to agree to this, now reduced to child abuser (is a doctor seriously going to use a little girl as bait, well, maybe after he's roughed her up a few times), characters (including a Stephen King/Fonzie wannabe) you simply can't wait to be butchered, an overacting, hyperventilating child that's annoying from minute one, a town spread over about 2 blocks – everything/one is within a few second walk and a steel-toed trenchcoated mystery guest, an obvious set up plot line for #6 that wouldn't have hit theatres for another six years. Apparently Michael's been a sleep a year – if what he has is a curse, I'd gladly take on that curse and sleep in that long – and he's back to kill at random, mimic his slasher-buddy Jason Vorhees, imitate a pedophile by a school, be stalked by his one-patient doctor and get his niece.

It has some interesting plot elements (Myers even sheds a tear at one point!) and the director tried to pump some energy into an essentially tired formula, but there a few too many things wrong with it....and most of them have already been mentioned by other reviewers. The most crucial flaw is that they kill off, early on, the most appealing character (by far) ever to appear in any ""Halloween"" film (including Jamie Lee Curtis), and then let a bunch of bland, uninteresting characters to carry the film along. And Michael isn't quite himself in this one. Not only is his hair too long, he also has become a virtuoso driver and toys around with his victims before killing them (especially in the long scene where he is mistaken by the heroine for her boyfriend), almost developing into a practical joker like a silent Freddy Krueger before becoming the brutal Myers we know.

While a little more grittier being very misogynistic and graphic (which the previous sequel wasn't) with its deaths, it's run-of-the-mill formula fell on the dull, lumpy side with it being less punctuated with grinding suspense and moody atmosphere (as some of it takes place in full daylight) concentrating on visceral unpleasantness and plastered jump scares. This low-budget production feels like a rushed job, and the misguided, wishy washy script just doesn't cut it even with a decent concept for its basis and a few unsettling surprises that caught me off guard. However there are some odd out of character moments involving Michael (toying with his victims, driving after them in what I guess beats slowly walking after them and showing a glimpse of emotion is just to name a few), useless comic routine police officers with ridiculous sound effects backing them up and a cloudy inclusion of a man dressed in black that seems to be following Michael around. The performances are simply mediocre, however the like of Danielle Harris radiates again and Ellie Cornell proves how much of a bold talent she is with a terrifically wholesome turn. Donald Pleasance looks ragged, but he passionately camps it up (with some morbid streaks) to show the obsessive strangle hold Myers has over Loomis' personally and mentally. As now he would do anything to get his man, even risking the life of Jamie to do so. Outside these three, there's not much else. I didn't find the teens here as agreeably likable. Dominique Othenin-Girard's direction is competent, but generically flat with little visual styling (which was an imprint of ""Return"") and few intensity filled pockets of shocks, which you only wished it could hold it throughout. Still Michael is used unnervingly as a foreshadow within the background of many shots and it always seems to work as he could be lurking anywhere. Also the creative novelty of the film's opening credits is a nice touch.It's more of the same, but an watchable pedestrian slasher blanketed with shocks.",Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers

And little Danielle Harris is acting her hardest, but Jamie is just annoying in this movie. The film also tries to make Michael more sympathetic while making Dr. Loomis almost a villain.

37,CuriosityKilledShawn,Horrible film with terrible acting,1,31 October 2000,"Never before have a seen a film that has been RUINED so much by the AWFUL teenagers (?) on display. They have nothing to do with the plot and contribute nothing to the film. All they do is run around throwing up appalling dialogue, most of which is shockingly bad ADR. There is a massive scene in a barn, which has nothing to do with anything, and is really only there to pad the film. They ruin the entire movie and I was VERY disappointed. The scenes with Michael Myers (now played by Don Shanks instead of George P. Wilbur), Doctor Loomis and Jamie are the only reason I didn't eject this film. They are the saving grace of this movie. But, unfortunately, all the grace in the Universe cannot make us forgive this film for having such POINTLESS and MEANINGLESS characters who turn it from almost a 'psychological horror' to a 'sub-standard cliché'. It's a shame.Halloween 4,5 and 6 started an ongoing plot line that was ignored in the abysmal Halloween H20 and it was also cut to shreds in the severely edited and re-arranged Halloween 6: The Curse of Michael Myers. The fact that 4,5 and 6 could have been very good makes this film worthy of attention. The fact that 4,5 and 6 suck is the fault of the creators.",Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers

39,851222,"Unnecessary, boring and quickly forgettable",5,10 November 2021,"Greetings from Lithuania.The fifth instalment into ""Halloween"" series called ""Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers"" (1989) was a highly unnecessary movie. I liked the 4th movie, it was a straightforward horror flick yet it worked for me. This one follows storyline from a 4th movie, but this time this 5th instalment didn't have got any plot in my opinion - it was just made because they were putting slasher flicks back in those years like crazy. The fact that this movie was released a 1 year after 4th parts says a lot - it was rushed as hell and it was not necessary at all.Overall, ""Halloween 5"" was just a quick cash grab of 1989. Plot if there was one was boring, it wasn't scary and it did not made many sense to even exist. Its not a terrible movie, but its extremely forgettable one and unnecessary.",Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers
40,Bored_Dragon,Franchise on life support,4,13 February 2019,"""The Revenge of Michael Myers"" is a direct sequel to ""The Return of Michael Myers"" and it doesn't bring anything especially new. It's dumb and dull and the author's lack of inspiration is more than obvious. This is yet another franchise kept alive on life support despite a complete lack of originality and purpose. To be honest, it would probably be best if the first ""Halloween"" has never grown into a franchise. The only thing I really liked was the excellent opening credits, which builds a tense atmosphere even before the movie started, so that when the movie finally begins you are already at the edge of your seat. Unfortunately, that tension dies up after just a few minutes and only my OCD made me watch the movie to the end. As far as acting is concerned, the very decent role played by Ellie Cornell in the previous film is now reduced to the classic slasher-horror blonde ""whose only purpose in the film is to run around half-naked before being slaughtered."" Loomis (Donald Pleasence) is the only character to maintain quality through all the parts, and the highlight of the film is again little Danielle Harris. Watchable, but a waste of time.4/10",Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers

Halloween (1978) is scarier. Halloween II (1981) is also scarier. Halloween 4 the return of Micheal Myers is also scarier. The sixth Halloween movie Halloween the curs of Micheal Myers is also scarier. The seventh Halloween movie Halloween H2O is also scarier. Halloween (2007) is also scarier. Halloween II (2009) is also scarier. But still this is a great film. Micheal Myers is a Warlock so this is a horror fantasy. A great horror fantasy. It has a great story. It also has great acting.

43,paulclaassen,How many synonyms are there for AWFUL?? Can I give it minus 10? One of the worst films ever.,1,10 October 2018,"The film starts with the final moments of of 'Halloween 4' (well, not the final final moments), and then continues directly, but then says 'One Year Later'. ?? What did Michael Myers do during all this time? Stayed with the old guy he stumbled upon??Jamie and Rachel are back, once again portrayed by Danielle Harris (who is once again very good) and Ellie Cornell. Off course Donald Pleasance is back as well as Dr Loomis. He is such an unpleasant character, and Michael Myers is still the stupidest, most passive antagonist I've seen in films. I honestly can't comprehend his fan base and popularity...What is Michael's case anyway? Why is he stalking and killing the people he does? There's no motive or pattern. Is he just randomly choosing people? One scene in particular is painstakingly bad. SPOILER. Michael kills Tina's boyfriend (who happens to be called Michael!), then goes over to Tina's place (how did he know where she lives?), hoots like an asshole at her front door as if mimicking her boyfriend, and even wears the mask Tina bought her boyfriend. WTF!!?? So, Michael has the mentality to pretend as her boyfriend? Why would he do that?? And when did Michael learn to drive like that? Oh, and off course Jamie senses that. Yup, this little girl has suddenly become clairvoyant! Michael then goes to the party Tina went to. How did he know about the party and where to go, since he did not follow Tina? What was the purpose of him going there? (apart from a bodycount, off course). There was nothing remotely interesting about the film. This was by far the worst yet...and that's not really saying much. It felt like the film was written by a 9-year old. Can PROFESSIONALS in the industry honestly concoct such a crappy script, let alone giving it the green light and a $3 million budget??? I mean, was this supposed to be taken seriously? At times it played like a spoof. This was just DREADFUL! Oh, and I just hate the illogical way they always stumble upon bodies in these films. Seriously, Hollywood, that is so cliched!Towards the end Dr Loomis leads Michael into a trap. When did he set up this trap and how did he manage to do it by himself?? Its just not credible and for effect only. Who was the mystery man during the film who helped Michael at the end and why? Nothing here makes any sense. Awful.",Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers
44,zkonedog,Only Slightly More Watchable Than Part Four,3,11 March 2017,"After the Halloween franchise made its ""triumphant"" return with the Michael Myers-based fourth installment, it became clear that the series was creatively bankrupt and nothing more than a cash cow. This fifth effort is a bit more watchable than that horrific fourth part, but not by a wide margin.For a basic plot summary, Myers seems to have no ill effects from his tumble down a mine shaft at the end of part four, and continues his pursuit of young Jamie Lloyd (Danielle Harris), whom he has seemingly developed a sort of psychic bond with (she can sense when he is about to kill). Still pursuing Myers is Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasance), as well as a mysterious ""Man in Black"" who is introduced in this film and explained further in the sixth part.The obvious problem with this film is that it is basically a retread of its predecessor, breaking no new ground whatsoever. Thus, things just keep getting more stale. Dr. Loomis keeps spouting the same warnings (which are never heeded until it is too late), Myers keeps on slicin' and dicin', and no real character development is present.I have to give the movie credit for trying to explain the demented character of Michael Myers (e.g. tattoo on wrist, ""Man in Black"" presence, etc.), but they needed to give us more than that in THIS film, not the NEXT one (which they ended up royally botching anyway). I think viewers are supposed to start to understand why Myers is such a maniac, but not enough hints are given to really make us care.About the only true bright spot (like in part four) is the acting of little Danielle Harris, who gives a very spirited performance for being such a youngster. Without her presence, this film would be very near an abomination through and through.Thus, if you are a fan of this series you'll watch this flick no matter what I say, but don't be surprised if you feel you have wasted about 90 minutes. Others just looking for a scary picture, please stay away and find something...anything...to take the place of this overrated sequel.",Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers
45,johnnyboyz,This is Halloween II mixed with a little bit of Halloween 4; so here it is from Myers' point of view:,4,11 December 2007,"Oh how careless and unsuspecting those Haddonfield residents are: now they see me, now they don't. I cannot describe the sensation that is being burnt alive; shot six times by a pistol; shot several times with various shotguns, pistols and an assault rifle simultaneously and I especially cannot describe what it is like falling through some sodden ground only to have a gravestone cave in on top of me. Maybe I cannot describe it because none of it really happened; after all  the third Halloween film only included me as part of a television trailer thus disconnecting me from the 'real' world entirely: poor shame.I can get away with anything, because I'm Michael Myers and I'm invincible. I've been shot and burnt and what have you loads of times but I keep coming back like the giant cockroach that won't die; I am invisible despite being the biggest person in the whole town; I am indestructible despite being a human being; I've been captured but then consequently escaped when I should have been victim of capital punishment long before I even got the chance to. Yes, I'm the thing that wouldn't die in the franchise that wouldn't die and isn't it grand? Rumours were back in the day that I was going to go up against Freddy Kruger in a spin off adventure of its own but that was shelved for fifteen years; Voorhees eventually got the role  Pah! Nobody likes Friday the Thirteenth anyway! Especially the one that had him most recently in space.But I am adamant that I can get over it by reliving some of my finest work from yesteryear particularly in the form of ""Halloween 5: The Revenge of Mi......"" Oh no, wait  this one was just 'Halloween 5' with no subheading, how disappointing. This time, I am convinced that I am invincible as well as invisible with brainless logic forming the basis of this addition to my ever increasingly daft adventures. Evidence comes in the form of: a dog barking at me loudly and yet nobody does or hears anything except for the owner who does or suspects nothing  it's worth saying here that it is Halloween eve in Haddonfield and it's only been a year since I was at large and the owner WAS warned on the phone  silly girl. Another case of idiocy on the resident's part was when the police come round to check; they leave after thinking it was a false alarm involving the dog but I'm smart: I hide in the closet and wait for them to go but when the silly girl opens the door to get something out, she still doesn't see me  unfortunately, she has since changed after finishing her shower.I'm Michael Myers and I'm invisible. I can stand amongst the bushes and stick out like a sore thumb but no one sees me. I am able to stand there and watch kids and their cars and partners mingle around a shop front: they are more interested in sex and alcohol than they are in values; when I was their age, I was being treated at a hospital after what I did when I was very young but they don't know anything about that: soon they will, though; soon they will. What I love about these kids is that I kill one of them and take his car  his name is, unbelievably: Michael. From here, I get to live out a fantasy I have never come within a light-year of ever experiencing. I drive to my new partner's house and pick her up; she dances for me showing me her Halloween costume thinking I'm Michael, which of course I am; she says my name in that wonderful voice she has and attempts conversation but I can't reply for two reasons: it would give the game away and I'm stone cold with adrenaline. We drive for a while and she asks to stop by a petrol station but I drive straight past before screeching round and going back  it would seem that a little girl whom I am related to has used her telepathic powers to tell the police where I am: the 'living the dream' is over but it was worth it.It would seem that when I do come face to face with my relative, it is in an attic of my Myers house that wasn't actually there in any other of my adventures. It's equally convenient that the authorities and my doctor at the hospital never thought to check the house to see if that's where I was staying during this Halloween. After all, they didn't check the surrounding area after I escaped into the river at the very beginning; especially since I lodged up in a shack owned by an old man  there I lay; for one year with no interference or anything like the old man reporting that he'd found me but how was I to know he'd keep quiet after I'd left? I wasn't, so I had to get rid of him of course. When it does come to the crunch; I delay over completing my goal in this edition as she lies there in my coffin bed  I shed a tear but I don't know why; she escapes and gets the better of me in a laundry chute  how careless of me: this invisible, indestructible killing machine is beaten by an infant. I guess David and Goliath can happen after all. Then again, with my most recent adventure a replay of my first and set in an entirely different universe; I can forget all about this particular episode and re-focus on what I do best: it's what you want and it's what I want.",Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers

47,digitalbeachbum,Trash,1,30 October 2021,"I remember when this was released. Everyone in school was talking about it and how frightened they were to watch it. However, there is a difference between gore and suspense. Alfred Hitchcock was the master of suspense. He could do more in one scene with out showing any violence or blood than any of these movies could ever poop out. This is not in any way a scary or suspenseful movie. It is gore. Period.There is no imagination left to the movie. The key to making a good scary movie is to let the viewer form their images in their own mind. Then they scare their selves. The best way to ruin a movie is to show too much. That's the problem with this movie. It shows everything. Who cares? Idiots. People who only want to see blood and guts.

49,insomniac_rod,The Halloween movies used to be slasher flicks!,5,25 December 2004,"""The Revenge of Michael Myers"" is most known for the Man in Black plot than for anything else. This is when the Halloween movies got weird.The movie follows the events of ""The Return of Michael Myers"" where Michael falls to an abandoned mine after being shot by Haddonfield's police men. Down there Michael is helped by an old beggar who takes care of him until he recovers conscience and health. Michael demonstrates why he's a son of a b**** and murders the old man that took care of him plus his parrot and once again starts his way to Haddonfield to terrorize his niece and everyone else that stands on his way.The 80's slasher elements are present through all the movie but there's a sinister Halloween feeling that makes this a different slasher flick. There's suspense, gore, ""scary"" music, and dramatic sub-plots that help to increase the movie's creepiness but... The movie is slow and the viewer loses interest on the events soon in the movie. The cinematography is very bad even on DVD. The connection between the climax and the ending confuses the audience and makes you wonder if you're still watching a Halloween flick. There are some dumb scenes. For example, a girl doesn't realizes that Michael is wearing her boyfriend's mask and she still gets in the car with him. And what's with the Psychic connection between Jamie and Michael?! It's a slasher flick, please! Also, there are long, painful, FALSE SCARE scenes that will make you want Myers to slaughter the stupid kids. Then, why would they give an important role for Tina? she had not charisma, interesting character background or anything. Also, Only Donald Pleasence is great on his role. He was a magnificent actor and one of his major achievements was to make this movie even watchable.In my opinion the Halloween movies are divided like these: -Part 1 and 2 as t slasher flicks with suspense and an intelligent plot. -Part 3 is a boring sci-fi horror movie. -Part 4, 5, and 6 tried to add dogmatism and complex plot development to the series. Plus part 6 created a plot based on an event that didn't have explanation (the origins of Myers' evil). A waste of time and a disgrace to the series. -Part 7 and 8 are post ""Scream"" slashers; I mean carbon copies of Wes Craven's horror comedy with the Michael Myers character.At least part 4 and 7 were made as tributes to the movies' 10th and 20th anniversary respectively. Part 5 is the decline of the Halloween movies. Why would you try to convert a straight slasher flick in a mystery movie with horror tones?! 5/10. Watch it only if you are a die hard fan of the Halloween movies. Otherwise you will be bored and confused. That's not what Horror movies are meant to be.",Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers

51,FiendishDramaturgy,Off track.,6,15 September 2004,"Of the entire series (aside, of course, from H3:SotW), this is the only installment which went off track.The stupid, comedic sound effects to the police officers in the beginning scenes were ludicrous. This installment was treated as Dominique Othenin-Girard's personal play toy to do with as he/she saw fit. This is the same type of crap we were fed with Omen IV and no wonder! He/She directed that garbage, too! Now, I won't say this is garbage, but it does lack respect for the genre and for the franchise. It comes across as a spoof of the Halloween line rather than an installment OF it. The musical score with its carnival-like melody did nothing whatsoever for the atmosphere. Only Donald Pleasence and Danielle Harris (the voice of Sierra in Father of the Pride and Jamie Lloyd in THIS work) seemed to know this was a horror movie, much less a chapter of the Halloween story.But their stunning performances went a long way in the salvation of this otherwise botched directional attempt. And at times, even Danielle Harris fell prey to this director's ineptitude.The camera angles were horrid and the lighting was amateurish, further taking away from what atmosphere Donald Pleasence could manage to get going. Then that circus music would start up in the background and you would hear some idiotic sound effect better suited in a Saturday Morning cartoon and BAMM! the atmosphere was gone again only to begin building to another nothing.The ""teen ager"" characters (portrayed by people at least in their mid-twenties) were so ill conceived and poorly developed that it made me happy to know they would soon die. These characters transformed this chapter into one of those horrible teen-ager cliché'd horror movies where the victims are too stupid to listen to anyone and when they die, you're nothing but glad they've finally shut UP.Eventually, the sound effects and disgusting circus music stops and the movie begins to get more serious and atmospheric. Thankfully, by around the second act, the idiocy seems to be over (for the most part but not entirely) and most everyone seems to remember there was supposed to be a point to this whole ... acting thing. (The cops NEVER seem to achieve any state of professionalism; not professional police officers and not professional actors PORTRAYING professional police officers.)After the unnecessary gratuitous sex scene in this ""horror"" movie, or rather during it, we begin to get down to business. Imagine it: Michael Myers with a plethora of farm implements! And by the time our heroine finds out there really is a problem (as IF everyone and their brother haven't been telling her there was a problem all along!), of course, she and Jamie are right in the thick of it. And when the killing starts, the effects are crap. The splatter effects are practically nonexistent which is fine by me, but someone ought to tell Gerard that in lieu of these effects there should be some sort of substance; a shadow of the killing rather than the actual killing itself, when the budget is too low to afford realism. Something! All in all, I suppose it's not too bad. But this one is a far cry from the rest of the series even with Danielle's excellent performance.Of course, this installment also creates a rift in later continuity, as Jamie tells Michael, ""You look just like me,"" but in both earlier and later chapters, he looks nothing like her.It rates a 6.4/10 from...the Fiend :.",Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers
52,Captain_Couth,Revenge of the 80's: The multiple sequels.,7,16 June 2004,"Halloween 5 (1989)  You can never keep a good man down.  But in this case logic is tossed out the window.  Michael Myers (who has more lives than a cat) returns to settle some unfinished business in this bleak and depressing forth Halloween film that chronicles the events of Haddonfield's resident killing machine.  The ""shape"" is back (again) to tie up some loose ends.  So is good ol' Doctor Loomis (man can't this guy do anything right) who's even more determined than ever to finally do away with his ""patient"". More of the same except darker.  Quite interesting however because unlike other franchise films this one sticks to a coherent storyline and it doesn't stray too far from it's original concept.

53,Polaris_DiB,Awful in pretty much every way imaginable,1,4 May 2007,"Ho boy, where to begin? At this point in the series, Dr. Loomis has become abusive, the characters are all hateful, Michael's slipping, and the scripts are making even less sense.We begin right where we left off from Halloween 4, a la Halloween I and II: Michael escapes from the mine shaft, crawls to safety, and gets nursed back to health by some random bum with a parrot. One year later and with a lot more energy, his immediate action once he's able to move is to off the bum and head back to town, hoping to hunt down his niece who now has a psychic connection with him. A troop of teenagers are introduced, and the movie promises carnage. Sort of.This movie is bad. By bad I mean incompetent on pretty much every level. In horror movies, part of the delight and part of the terror is the fact that the teenagers die, but one character at least we hope will live. Not so in this one. Every single character is a hateful, stereotypical 80s idea of idiocy, and Michael's carnage can't come soon enough. This storytelling is backed up by probably some of the worst editing and directing I've ever seen, as characters move sporadically through jump cuts to... well, they don't really do much of anything, except ignore the warnings of a traumatized little child with a psychic connection to a serial killer. That role is given over to Donald Pleasence's Dr. Loomis, who somehow still has a practice and still is listened to, despite the fact that at this point he breaks about every rule of clinical ethics and the fact that he's an obnoxious jerk.Breaks every rule... that's what this movie does. This movie is so unable to bring actual horror, suspense, or gory delights to the fore that it literally just bumbles around hoping for something to photograph until Michael comes around, and then the storyline and directing are so incompetent they can't even make Michael seem cool. The scenes in the barn are pretty much must-see for film students who want to know exactly what NOT to do. And then, as if it's not enough, the movie has the audacity to introduce a new character for the sole purpose of letting Michael out of prison... who he is, what he's there for, what he knows, even if it's a he... there's no explanation. They literally wrote a character into the script because they were too lazy to know how to end this movie. That's like THE single basic screenplay no-no.Of course, there's always room for camp, but camp only works when the film goes in outrageous directions and does things creative and fun. This movie isn't even creative enough to come up with crazy, out-there ideas like Halloween 3, it just lazily serves the tropes of its genre without even the craft and skill required to make a successful continuity cut! By the time this movie ends, you will feel frustrated, bored, betrayed, and uninterested. While this movie plays, you will wish for every character to die just so that you no longer have to watch their stupid, mindless antics, and you will regret renting (or buying) the disc. Halloween 5 isn't even worth the plastic it's printed on, and that's bad considering how cheap it is to put things on DVD.--PolarisDiB",Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers
54,Stevieboy666,"The weakest of the first 5 Halloween movies, worse was to come..",6,1 November 2020,"Halloween 5 takes off right from the end of part 4, itself a pretty decent entry. Despite being ran over, shot, falling down a mine shaft then floating down a river killer Michael Myers survives. He is taken in by some kind of mountain man - for a year(!!) - then the following Halloween Michael repays his kindness by killing him, then goes on his usual holiday rampage. The great Donald Pleasence once again resumes the role of Dr Loomis, although one of the best characters in the film (that's not saying much) he does seem a bit over the top in this one. Future Scream Queen Danielle Harris also returns as Myer's young niece Jamie, they have somehow gained a psychic link between them.
There is some good camerawork here and the kill scenes are set up nicely, however the addition of a pair of ""comedy"" cops just isn't right. There is a new character thrown in, a mysterious cowboy, dressed all in black and who's face we don't see or voice we don't hear. No benefit to the plot at all in my opinion, other than fuel for the inevitable sequel. We do very briefly glimpse Michael's face, an attempt to humanise the monster maybe, but again I felt that it adds little.

""Michael Myers"" looks good in this film, he's still menacing & brutal.
I like some of the new characters especially ""Tina Williams"" played by Wendy Foxworth & ""Samantha Thomas"" played by Tamara Glynn, these two are fun girls just trying to enjoy a Halloween party, these two are nice & fun in their roles.Each entry is Good, it's just some are better or than others but they're all watchable & i will always adore this Horror franchise like i do the ""Jaws"" & ""Friday the 13th"" franchise's, but the Halloween films will always be the best in my opinion.
There is some great scenes like the ""Barn scene"" at the Halloween party, that's the standout iconic scene of the film, the music is still great & the Halloween atmosphere & mood is done right, it's entertaining & a nice easy watch for a Halloween night movie!!!
It's one of the Halloween films in the franchise that has grown on me more & more as did ""Halloween: Resurrection"" the thing is if love the franchise like i do, it's easy to forgive the films that have some faults in them as atleast they are all easy watching & entertaining.",Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers

There's a few nicely atmospheric scenes though that I hazily remember (I was super stoned for some of these back in the day) a surreal halloween costume pageant that showcased some cool cinematography, and a neat chase scene involving Jamie Lloyd stuck in a ventilation duct, Michael frantically clawing at her from above. Don't even talk to me about his mask in this one you can see in the photos above that its even more retarded and wrong than in the fourth film, believe it or not. The film is slightly clunky, with a murky plotted, messy narrative and one extremely irritating female character, but it's still a Halloween film by God and thats good enough for me. Ellie Cornell as Rachel survived to live another day here, which is nice since she's a solid protagonist too. The suspension of disbelief is real out here though, since Michael was basically freaking annihilated at the end of number four, but back and spry as ever (no spring chicken age wise either) to cause athletic havoc again. But hey... he's Michael Myers.",Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers
58,drownnnsoda,"Alright, But Not Great.",6,31 May 2006,"""Halloween 5"" is a follow-up to part 4, and still focuses on Jamie Lloyd, Michael Myer's niece who escaped his reign of terror in part 4. Jamie is now in a children's hospital, and for some strange reason is able to channel in with Michael's mind, and knows where he is at. As Halloween nears again, Dr. Loomis begins to track down Michael who has seemed to make a return, and is using Jamie as his tool to find where Michael may be.This was a decent follow-up to part 4, but it has it's faults. We actually get to see Michael's face in the climax of the film, when Jamie is being attacked by Michael in the attic, which was kind of surprising but unneeded in my opinion (I mean, we already saw it happen in the original). The subplot with Jamie being able to psychologically track where Michael is was different, but I don't know if it was completely necessary either - it made things a little less believable. The film leaves you hanging off of a cliff, when Jamie is taken away by a man in all black. This subplot within the series is later explained into more detail a bit in part 6, so watch ""Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers"" after this and you will be able to understand the ending a little more.Aside from the faults in the film, ""Halloween 5"" has some decent scares and good moments, including some interesting death scenes and some nice cinematography. Overall, it's not a bad sequel, but it isn't exactly great either. But it won't be hard to please the ""Halloween"" fans. 6/10.",Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers

They should've made halloween 1, 2, then H20, then quit altogether. And this one, is just soo boring, sad, disappointing, annoying, I think the filmmakers wanted to see how much they could annoy you in 2 hours! Jamie was an annoying character, Jamie's adoptive sister was killed, which was sad, the suspense was boring and dumb, this movie just will drive you to the point of insanity. It's just soo bad, it's almost self aware, I don't know how the makers could've thought it would be good while writing it! Overall I'll be generous and give halloween 5 a 2/10.

60,hu675,This Sequel has great possibilities but falls apart somewhere in the writing of this so-so script.,6,13 September 2006,"It's been a year ago that the infamous night Michael Myers (Don Shanks) came back home to Haddonfield, Illions trying to murder his only living niece Jamie (Danielle Harris). That same night, the state troopers thought they destroyed him by throwing a stick of dynamite at a underground mine shaft. But they didn't, Michael has survived. One year later, his traumatized niece find herself having a telepathic bond with her evil uncle! Now Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasence) is trying to destroy ""The Boogeyman"" by using his niece as bait.Directed by Dominique Othenin-Girard made an routine but sometimes lively sequel to the ""Halloween Series"". A few great moments of suspense and terror cannot overcome a weak screenplay. Which the director is also one of three writers of this fifth movie, which is sadly the least effective of the entire series. Some truly unlikeable victims (Played badly by the actors) and lame comic relief nearly ruined the possible feeling of fear in this one. Especially a few truly bad pop songs in the movie. But the picture isn't a complete waste thanks to Harris' good performance, Pleasence's always amusing role (Which his character is more over the top than ever with each Halloween picture, he's been in) and Alan Howarth's excellent music score saves from a complete bomb.The latest Special Divimax Edition from Anchor Bay is good. DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (1.85:1) transfer and an good digitally remastered-Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. The DVD most intriguing feature is the audio commentary track by the director, actress:Harris and actor:Jeffery Landman (Who played Jamie's friend ""Billy"" in the movie) talking about all what went good and bad during the production. Especially when the director admits some of the mistakes, he made some of the strange choices he made during filming and the unexplainable logic (Sometimes unintentional funny) of the already not so hot script.DVD also have introduction by the stars:Harris and Ellie Cornell (Who plays Jamie's step-sister, which unfortunately died too quickly in this film). Which Cornell's role was memorable in Halloween 4. DVD also has interesting on-set behind the scenes footage, 17 minute documentary with the cast & crew (From the 2001 DVD Edition) and the theatrical trailer. Thanks to the DVD commentary, the fifth Halloween movie makes me appreciate the film a little more but it's still a misfired picture. Especially when Michael Myers' character (Who started as a truly frightening killer) turned into a run of the mill slasher movie. Which feels a bit of a letdown. This film is only to the dedicated fans of the series only. (** ½/*****).",Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers
61,JoeKarlosi,Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers (1989) *1/2,3,7 September 2007,"It's Halloween time again, one year after the events of HALLOWEEN 4. Michael Myers, previously shot numerous times and then dumped down an old mining shaft, had managed to crawl his injured self away into a river whose current has deposited him at the doorstep of some old hermit. Presumably this non-talkative man took care of Michael and nursed him back to health for the last twelve months, since once the next October 31st rolls around, Myers instinctively knows it's time to go back to stalk his little niece Jamie (Danielle Harris) again. Meanwhile, young Jamie has lost her speech from the trauma of chapter four, and is hospitalized under the care of Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasence). But the child has developed a telekenetic bond with her regenerated uncle, and she seems to be able to sense his movements and predict where he'll strike next. So on another typical Halloween Night in Haddonfield, nobody can even enjoy a friendly masquerade party when Mike Myers is in town carving up.HALLOWEEN 5 gets my vote as the worst in the entire Halloween series. There's so much wrong with it that it's tough to figure out where to begin. The thing starts off well enough with a suspenseful opening credits sequence, followed by a respectable recap of the ending of Part 4... and then the well-handled, if far-fetched, moonlight swim of Michael's down the river to safety. But after this, things get steadily flushed more and more downstream. Donald Pleasence is a complete loon in this one, crazier and more abusive and despicable than in the past. Danielle Harris acts very convincingly as the distraught girl who's always freaking out, but after awhile her whining becomes grating. Wendy Kaplan, who plays the new lead girl Tina this time, is a real pain in the ass, and her dumb friends who are hanging around to pad up the body count are possibly even more annoying than she is. Oh, and the character of Rachel (Ellie Cornell) returns from the previous film, but not for long and then nobody seems to remember to wonder what's happened to her. Now, we've all seen '80s horror films where we have to deal with endless ""fake jump scares,"" but I have to think this one takes the cake for using more of them in a single film than any other movie. I thought Michael Myers' mask was weak last time, but it hits a series low point for cheapness here, and by the time the movie's over the psycho killer himself turns sappy. One diamond in this rough is a nice scene where Myers tries to repeatedly attack little Jamie, who is hiding inside an old fashioned laundry chute. One of the silliest subplots in history concerns a mysterious man seen only in black cape and boots, who incomprehensibly glides in and out from time to time, apparently having some interest in Michael Myers, sort of like a guardian angel. His true purpose wasn't revealed until HALLOWEEN 6 several years later, but at the time HALLOWEEN 5 was made there wasn't any decision as to what the filmmakers would do with him, so his presence makes no sense for the purpose of this movie. *1/2 out of ****",Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers
62,aidanratesmovies,Hollow Shell of a Film,2,6 July 2021,"Losing all of its promise within the first 20 minutes, and relying on every horror movie cliche in the book, Halloween 5 somehow is progressively worse than the last film, and has even far less to offer. First off, we have to recognize that the plot for this film is absolutely ridiculous. It was bound to be, and thankfully it doesn't go step-by-step through the original like last time either- but what results is hardly any better. Instead of a copycat film, we get a copycat of a copycat- relying on horror movie cliches and plot points so average anyone with a brain could recognize them. The film is incredibly tedious and frustratingly dull, not to mention the logic with the characters in this film is so stupid I honestly wondered at first if the film was a joke. When people make fun of horror movies for stupid decisions, I swear, this is where that stereotype came from. The acting is completely overdone, and each line of dialogue tries so hard to be important that it nearly strains itself in the process. Also the music is ridiculous at times, making almost hip hop beats of its signature theme, which just goes further into my thought that this film had to be a joke. It has its moments towards the beginning of a somewhat thrilling nature- but in the end, Halloween 5 is a massive dud- and one horror sequel I will certainly look forward to avoiding for the rest of my life.My Rating: 2.4/10.",Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers
63,truemythmedia,"Really Silly, Yet, Somehow, Enjoyable",6,31 October 2019,"Let me start this review right out by saying that this has been my personal favorite entry in the ""Halloween"" franchise thus far after the original film. Let me also clarify and say that I don't actually know if, from a cinematic standpoint, ""Halloween V"" better than ""Halloween II"", but it's certainly the most interesting. I think John Carpenter must've known that Michael Meyer's character- a psychotic, unstoppable man- only has so much he can do before he gets boring, and that's why Carpenter tried to shift the series to an anthology franchise with ""Halloween III: Season of the Witch"", which, for the record, I didn't find all that appealing either. ""Halloween IV: The Return of Michael Myers"" brought Mikey back (who'd have thunk?), but it didn't really do much with Michael's character other than toss him into the same murderous situations over and over again, only this time he was also after his niece, Jamie (Danielle Harris, ""Halloween IV"").Jamie added a bit of interest to the last film, but she was a bit underutilized up until the end. The film hinted at a kind of psychic connection between Jamie and Michael, and that connection is expanded upon in this film. If you're only a fan of the original film because Michael was a shadowy shape that was an unstoppable force, then the psychic elements probably won't do much for you, but if you've drank the franchise kool aid, this development is actually kind of cool. This film utilizes that psychic connections for some twists that seem incredibly farfetched, but at the same time it sort of works in the universe of the film. For example there's one scene where Jamie has a vision of a gas station, and she's able to convince the police to arrive at this station to stop Michael from convincing a murder. Now, if you think about this scene logically, it doesn't make a lick of sense: Do you really think that police are going to take the word of a little girl who claims she has a psychic link to a serial killer? Furthermore, do you think even if the police did take Jamie's word, that they would be able to get to this particular gas station instantly? Probably not. There are plenty of logic issues with the film, but if you sort of just roll with the idea that Michael's world doesn't really line up with the laws of nature anymore, the film isn't terrible. Other than the first ""Halloween"", the series isn't all that great to begin with, but for whatever reason people seem to love Michael Myers. It's took me a few times watching through the first film to really appreciate Mike, but now that I've watched a few more sequels I find his character easier to enjoy. Myers' films aren't ever particularly complex or compelling, but they can be fun, and this one, in my opinion, is one of the more entertaining entries in the series thus far!",Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers
64,Movie-ManDan,I Loved This!,9,13 November 2014,"This is the scariest Halloween movie there is. The first is still the best, but this is scarier. The whole story with Loomis and Michael's niece continues in what is the second best sequel in my opinion (after H2O). Aside from this being the scariest, it is also very well-done. The movie was rushed in production taking just a few months to make, but that's not a big deal. There are some flaws, but the movie sucks you so far into it, you aren't that intrigued by the flaws. What makes this great is how good the actors are. Danielle Harris is amazing as Jamie Lloyd (even better than in Halloween 4) and Donald Pleasance does his best Dr. Loomis portrayal.One year after Jamie seemingly adapts Michael's powers, she lives in a children's mental clinic and is mute, while Michael was unconscious in a shack. He wakes up and is out to kill his niece, who senses Michael and can save his rage. Rage boils inside Dr. Loomis as he tries to put an end to Michael Myers once and for all.But I can see why some people would not care for this. Jamie is scared and screams throughout the whole movie. So that may annoy some viewers. But she is such a good actress, you have no other choice but to feel for her and pray she survives. Many people also didn't like Michael becoming a Jason Voorhees-like character. If anything, Jason is a rip-off on Michael since Halloween came out before Friday The 13th. There are also some unanswered questions with an odd tattoo and a man dressed in black with metal-toed boots. All that is answered in Halloween 6, which sucked! Anyway, there is a good build-up and some early kills, but when Michael goes on his usual murderous rampage on halloween night, there is a bigger body-count, more twists, more suspense and more at stake.3/4",Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers
65,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,So much of its writing feels lazy now,5,17 October 2016,"There comes a point in time where a viewer who has seen enough sequels to a horror franchise where it doesn't phase them anymore. When a formula is repeated over and over and over and over again, the redundancy feels more like an attribute of lazy writing versus actually copying out of flattery. It's obvious as to why studios love making sequels but it's crazy as to how they believe one exact formula is necessary for all entries. There has to be some kind of creative brainstorming going on in the background otherwise every entry after the original continues to just rinse and rehash the same concept until the end of its run. After the blunder of Halloween III: Season of the Witch (1982) and the lukewarm return of Halloween IV: The Return of Michael Myers (1988), production studio Magnum Pictures Inc. felt a year later was just enough time to make another sequel. Unfortunately since Halloween III: Season of the Witch (1982), there has been a stagnation of quality in this series. This is okay but nothing to cheer over either.Written by Michael Jacobs, Shem Bitterman and Dominique Othenin-Girard, the story picks up a year later after the last film. After killing her stepmother, Jaime Strode (Danielle Harris) now lives in a child care clinic where she is under the supervision of Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasence). Knowing that her uncle Michael Myers (Don Shanks) is still alive and well, Dr. Loomis hopes to get whatever information he can from his now mute niece. Trying to keep a cool head is returning characters Jaime's stepsister Rachel (Ellie Cornell), her friend Tina (Wendy Foxworth) and the local sheriff Ben Meeker (Beau Starr). It sounds like an okay setup but really much the execution is flawed. For the three writers mentioned, all but one had prior horror film making experience so that's already a fairly bad start when it comes to continuing a horror franchise. Directing this sequel was also writer Dominique Othenin-Girard. Girard's direction unfortunately does not improve the viewing experience all that much.What truly hurts this sequel's performance is how empty the story is on substance and the few frightening moments. This is by far the sequel with the most holes in its plot. There's no explanation to numerous things. No reason as to why Jaime no longer has the Myer's killer instinct. No understanding is made as to why Michael Myers returned exactly one year later when he could've done so much sooner. Nothing is justified as to why Jaime is mute after the events of the first movie. There's even a new character that enters this series and he too is given no background information whatsoever. What gives? The pacing is another problem. Like the slew of other slasher films that were inspired by its original film, many scenes contain teenagers walking around calling out into vacant rooms and saying how much it isn't funny anymore. There needs to be development in some of these characters otherwise, there's no scare factor involved throughout the movie. There are some moments of intrigue that are made as the film gets closer to the finale but that's it.The kill scenes are also rather disappointing. Only a couple of Michael Myers' victims have a memorable scene with him. A lot of the other deaths are off screen. There's also nothing wrong with the idea of less is more, but there's nothing new that's added to the end result. However here is what does work. The main actors such as Danielle Harris and Donald Pleasence are the best parts. As much as it's sad to see Pleasence continue to try and make this series watchable, he still carries some kind of dramatic heft. Although his character is becoming less and less useful. Harris was okay although she is mute. Her fear looks real on screen as well when Myers is around. Shanks as Myers was okay too but did miss the opportunity to do several Myers like responses such as the infamous ""head tilt"". The rest of the supporting cast is all right but they do not add much to the actual narrative. The thing viewers can be grateful for is at least the casting department brought back what was left of the previous cast for another round.The visual aspect of things was decent as well. Robert Draper handled the cinematography. Although he had worked on small and big screen productions, this was Draper's first big theatrical entry. For what was shown, it looked adequate. It was when Draper's skill and the set decorations worked together to create some creepy scenes. Sadly it wasn't very often but when it was seen, it worked. This takes place in the old Myer's house. Returning composer Alan Howarth produced the musical score. Considering he has been apart of the franchise dating back to Halloween II (1981) with John Carpenter, it's reassuring to know there's one more dedicated crewmember. Howarth's score continues Carpenter's memorable theme from the series and includes various other motifs as well. It isn't perfect nor is it entirely effective but it does make up for a lot of the other issues going on with this movie. The score itself is still mainly made up of synthesizer keyboard and that's fine looking at it's origins.While it may have a decent musical score, returning credible actors and adequate camera-work, this sequel continues to hit the middle of the road. The story is bare bones developed, the reasoning behind several things goes untouched, its pacing is pretty slow and the creep factor is hardly there. It's not worse than any other prior entry starting from Halloween II (1981) but it doesn't bother to add much either.",Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers
66,alexanderdavies-99382,Worth seeing for Pleasence and Harris - they hide a confusing plot.,6,8 September 2017,"It was the right move to release the next ""Halloween"" film soon after the fourth one. The events that led to the previous film's conclusion, naturally paved the way for the story of ""Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers."" As before, Donald Pleasence as the slightly unhinged Sam Loomis and Danielle Harris as Jamie are back and they make the film watchable. Ellie Cornell is written out near the beginning, which was a mistake in my opinion. She was a good character in the previous film and relevant to the plot. However, it is left to Pleasence and Harris to carry the movie between them and they do this very well. The story moves one year on after the Halloween of 1988. Jamie is now a patient of Doctor Loomis and she seems to be telepathically linked with Michael Myers, in that she can sense where he is and who he will slain next. This part of the film makes little sense as it isn't fully explained. That applies to the story in general. There is no explanation given as to who the man in the cowboy boots is. We don't see his face and no one mentions him in the script. He simply appears out of nowhere and the audience is expected to take it for granted that the character has some relevance. From my vantage point, he does not. The murder scenes are capably handled and Donald Pleasence gives a typically good performance. Danielle Harris is once again an effective performer and has been promoted to ""leading lady"" status for this film. It was crucial that the two main characters be played by the same actors, especially as this ""Halloween"" film comes so soon after the previous one. I enjoyed the scenes with Pleasence calling out to Myers in the woods after Jamie has been saved for the time being and also the confrontation between the Doctor and his former patient inside the old Myers residence. Michael Myers looks a bit more physically imposing this time around, which is good. The mask still looks a bit stupid though! The ending left me feeling a bit cheated. The mysterious man in the cowboy boots comes along and rescues Myers and slaughters the entire Haddonfield police department. That is all very well but what about Loomis and Jamie? What happened to them? The former character has vanished without a trace and the latter is left standing in the police department on her own....

Apparently, some people will miss Tina so Dr.Loomis goes out to stop Michael for once and for all. Again.

I don't really know why, because Michael doesn't do a damn thing. None of the ""Halloween""-movies is particularly well-paced, but this is just plain ridiculous. Kill someone, something, yourself, I don't care, do SOMETHING! Eventually he goes after Jamie, but come on, like they're really going to kill of a little girl. There's some more, something about how Michael is driven by some sort of ""rage"". Given that he chases random people with a butcher's knife, that is an interesting theory. We also get a pretty good Donald Pleasence speech on the subject. A step up for him, he spent the last two sequels just commenting on how Michael can't be stopped. Not with that attitude, no. He could still bring some relief from the boredom, but not enough. As if some guy killing people isn't enough of a story, there's also a really crummy subplot that could fall apart any second, about a ""man in black"". We get to see him, or at least his shoes going someplace, and he has something to do with Michael. I suppose that's another attempt to keep stuff smarter than ""Friday The 13th"", but boy does it fail. This mystery just doesn't work at all. This is just not a good movie.

Its 90 minutes run time seems much longer than it actually is, though, because the remainder of the film was obnoxious characters meeting with darkly photographed ends. Donald Pleasance's character is needless cruel, and the filmmakers unsuccessfully went for a Psycho-like twist by killing off a lead girl thirty minutes into the film.Probably the most violent Halloween film, it is also the second film in a row in this series (and the third Halloween film overall) which retroactively changes the previous film's ending, which makes this film's pointless, nihilistic ending even more irrelevant.",Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers

Even the opening credits to this film were great. On top of that, the first few minutes of the film were great after we were introduced to a supernatural aspect, which made the movie different from all of the other HALLOWEEN movies.However, the movie slowly starts to fall apart once one of our major characters gets killed within 20 minutes of the film.

I will not reveal the person who gets killed but we're then introduced to new and more annoying teenagers all having the same wretched lines you would ever hear from teenagers like them.

This HALLOWEEN is, so far, the most impressive in terms of technicality, which includes sound effects, lighting, cinematography, etc. I was very impressed! There are more stylistic shots and more shaky-cam which enhances some suspense in some chase scenes.But other than that, it's the same ol' same ol' but the difference here is that we're being treated with some very awful characters pounding their awful lines to our heads.

If for no other reason than because they seem to try just a modicum harder in their effort to deliver solid slasher-tales than many other franchises.But when the series falters, it seriously falters as has been the case with more than one of its follow-ups. Whether it be the bizarre pseudo-magical leanings of ""The Curse of Michael Myers"" or the gag- worthy and condescending ""trendiness"" and ""modernness"" of ""Resurrection""... the series has had its share of duds. And I do think ""Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers"" is among them.Essentially a continuation more-or-less picking up a year after ""Halloween 4"", we learn that Michael escaped his demise in the collapsed mineshaft and has fallen into a coma while his body is looked after by an old hermit. (...yeah, that part has confused me for as long as I remember.) One year later, he awakens, kills the man who has been watching over him and resumes his hunt for niece Jamie (Danielle Harris), who is now mute and stuck in a psychiatric children's clinic due to the whole ""My uncle is a killer and I nearly killed my own mom last year"" fiasco. Understandable, I guess.As the bodies begin to pile up in Michael's wake, Jamie realizes she has formed a sort-of psychic connection with her deranged relative and now has the ability to see where he's going to strike. And so she must team up with the police and Michael's obsessed former psychologist Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasence) to try save the day and stop him once and for all.The biggest failing of the film is that it really is just a repetitious ""expansion"" on the previous installment with nothing to really set it apart. You don't feel like you're watching the fifth film... you feel like you're watching a collection of deleted scenes from the last movie that have been padded out to feature length by adding in contrived new plot lines. Granted this is perhaps the result of a rushed production to get a sequel out only one year later, but even by those means, it's pretty sub-par, with a reliance on cliché and convenience to further the plot and a lot of meandering ideas that were clearly not fleshed out and were written on a whim with the thought ""We'll just figure these out in the next movie!"" It's even all the more confusing as the much-better, earlier ""Halloween II"" literally was just an expansion on the last film, but was handled with just enough care as to still feel fresh and unique on its own.The strengths of the film lay in the performances of the fairly excellent cast. Pleasence as always is a joy as the increasingly unhinged Dr. Loomis, and he brings a certain degree of class and gravitas to the role despite the sub-par material. Harris makes for a great child actor and an easily likable hero who you can't help but root for. And supporting roles by the likes of Ellie Cornell and Wendy Kaplan do what they can with their limited screen time, emerging as likable supporting characters to our leads.Still, it feels that director Dominique Othenin-Girard and the small army of screenwriters are simply going through the motions here. It's just a rinse-and-repeat cycle of establishing characters, putting them into secluded spots and watching them get axed off while they have sex or do morally dubious things. Even the somewhat silly but interesting idea of Jamie having a psychic connection to her uncle is a bit off and feels like a last-minute addition to try and add a ticking-clock element to a few scenes. And I hope you like sequel baiting! Because that's gonna happen... a lot. Even early in the film, so I'm not spoiling anything.As it stands, while it may not be the worst of the franchise, ""Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers"" is perhaps the most dull. It's merely a cash-grab that was created to hopefully lead to even more cash-grabs in the future.And so, I give it a somewhat sub-par 4 out of 10.",Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers
73,m-47826,Very unpleasant sequel.,2,4 October 2020,"To think they destroyed efforts made in the previous movie like that, is baffling. The Rachel character don't even make sense. She also lived a traumatizing experience, and she's all chirpy and carefree, only a year after the events? I know It's probably her annoying friend Tina, rubbing off on her, but still. It completely cheapened her part in this sequel. Not to mention her death scene... Like they just wanted to dispose of her, to get to the « real » part of the story. And it was so bad... It lacked atmosphere and focus. None of the characters were worth rooting for. The acting was awful. Even actors that did a good job on Return, looked as if they were not into it. I think the script and the directing, are a lot to blame for that. This and the way the movie was rushed into production... Sorry fans, but to me it is by far one of the worst movies in the franchise. So frustrating and muddled I couldn't wait for it to end. It even made me think of one of those bad Friday/Elm Street sequels. That's how underwhelming it was.",Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers
74,MartianOctocretr5,Even Michael Myers was rolling his eyes at this one,3,4 November 2010,"By the fifth installment, new ideas were in short supply for this once towering franchise. Michael comes back (again). OK, this guy has been stabbed a lot, shot numerous times, french fried in fires, crushed by boulders, blown up, run over by cars and trucks, fallen from heights, flushed down toilets, been forced to watch Tom Cruise marathons, and so on. And he's always back for more. Yet dopey cops and vigilantes try to fight him; hello there; he's kind of indestructible you guys. Like a bogey man creature. That makes money for movie producers every time he shows up. You might have trouble killing him, you know? I know, I'm wasting my breath. Horror movie extras are dumb. And suicidal.So he still wants to croak his sister. And anybody that's anywhere near her. Or if they're cops. Or if they're teens who forever laugh about him. Or a couple on a date that say stupid stuff. Any of that sound familiar? He robotically saunters around a town that everybody probably would have moved out of by now if they had any brain power. But nobody does, especially whoever concocted this mess. Mikey still has his trusty knife, and doesn't say much. Sometimes he likes to stand there a while before killing somebody. Sometimes he does a jump scare murder to wake you up. If you just want to see blood spraying around, there's plenty of that. At all times, the acting makes the kills almost seem merciful to the audience. There's a pitiful attempt to showcase Michael's world, and that goes predictably nowhere. Nothing new, just endless horror movie clichés.Michael is currently hunting down the people responsible for this movie.",Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers
75,rivertam26,Flawed but entertaining,7,24 February 2020,Michael returns again in this rushed sequel that's still quite a bit of fun. Picking up a year after the events of its superior sequel. Jamie now lives in a foster home and is mute. Once again played by a solid Danielle Harris. After falling down the well in the last film he's saved by a homeless dude and awakens a year later to try and get Jamie once again. This entry is a little uneven tone wise. There are weird lapses in humor most because of two goofy cops. Michael is still in pretty strong form but his victims are mostly forgettable. Sadly Ellie Cornell is only in a small part and the new final girl Tina isn't as strong. It all leads up to a questionable finale and although nothing is on par with the rooftop sequence from the last film. The laundry schute scene is pretty terrifying.,Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers
76,Analog_Devotee,"7/10 -- A FILM WHICH SEASONED HORROR FANS MUST APPROACH DIFFERENTLY, AND OTHERS NEED NOT APPLY.",7,23 July 2021,"Yeah, the cheese is laid on a lot more thick than we're used to in correlation with previous installments, but I can't help but play Devil's advocate for this one. The fodder characters are much more exaggerated and the kills are more extreme, both of which seem to inject a feeling similar to the jump from Friday the 13th Part 2 to Part 3 (the latter of which is often criticized for not matching the plateau of suspense the former managed to garner).I guess what I'm trying to say is, there are parts of this film that don't feel like what we're used to up to this point in the franchise. A lot of these kills would arguably be more at home in Friday the 13th. Same with the teenagers. And the premature death of Rachel (a moment most of us probably just look away from at this point) feels wildly out of place. But again, in another slasher franchise, we might EXPECT Rachel to bite the dust early on. In another franchise, it could be considered a near-lethal dose of suspense to kill off the previous final girl. Here, however, it only manages to come off as disrespectful.Back in the day, when I used to double-feature this with Halloween 4 on the regular, I started to really grow frustrated with this film. I even started to hate it. Halloween 4 is so suspense-heavy, so exactly what the majority of us Halloween fans want, that this installment can often feel like a slap in the face, ESPECIALLY if you're double-featuring it with H4. Although they're seemingly meant to be viewed in that way, I think it's a mistake to do so. I think you have to approach this film with a completely different mindset than you would with H4 (or any previous installments, but also H6 and H:20)You gotta approach this one like you'd approach F13 Part 3 or Part 7, or maybe Child's Play 3 or Return of the Living Dead Part 2. Approach it knowing it's cheesy and pulpy and leaning toward ridiculous.All that being said, though, there are still mainstays present for the fans. The laundry chute scene is in my top 5 of the entire franchise (when I saw it for the first time as a youngin', I could barely hold still in my seat). Dr. Loomis is present with his top-tier acting chops and is obviously on board to give a memorable performance. Some would say the writing of his character in this film falls into the cheesiness I described earlier. I disagree. I think seeing Loomis really start to go nuts is quite enjoyable.Anyway, 7/10 feels right for me. I've been as high as a 9 and as low as a 4 on this one over the years. But 7 feels like my forever-rating.",Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers
77,Pumpkin_Man,Michael's Revenge!!!,10,22 September 2008,"I love almost all the HALLOWEEN films, but this one goes a little downhill for me for two reasons; (1)If they made the Myers house more believable and not a mansion. (2) Not hint about the stupid thorn curse, then I would probably like it a lot more! One year after stabbing her foster mother, Jamie Lloyd has been taken to a children's hospital. Since Jamie touched Michael's hand, she exhibits signs of a telepathic link with her Uncle Michael. On HALLOWEEN, Michael returns to Haddonfield to finish what he started last year. Rachel, Tina, Mikey, Spitz, and Sammy become Michael's new targets at a HALLOWEEN party as he tries to find Jamie. (That party was awesome with all the HALLOWEEN decorations and costumes!) I love the scene when Michael is chasing Jamie, Billy, and Tina through the cornfields with the car! Donald Pleasence is back playing the awesome Dr. Loomis who tries to hunt Michael throughout the HALLOWEEN night at all costs. Later, Loomis takes Jamie to the Myers house. I love scenes of the police and S.W.A.T. team stakeout at Michael's house. That's pretty cool. Loomis tries to reason with Michael one last time before the showdown. Loomis uses Jamie as bait to trap Michael. When Loomis finally stops Michael, he is taken to the police station, so that the U.S. National Guard will take Michael to a maximum-security prison until he dies, but something bad happens. What happens? You'll just have to watch! If you love the HALLOWEEN series, maybe you'll love HALLOWEEN 5: THE REVENGE OF MICHAEL MYERS!!!",Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers
78,gedikreverdi,Michael's funeral house at the attic,6,6 October 2021,"Michael had fallen into a well in the previous installment and he got into the river and ended up at the house of an old man living by the river and when he woke up after a year, he killed the old guy (he's such a sociopath indeed).Then Jamie couldn't speak because she was traumatized and could tell when Michael was about to kill someone. The problem was the actors were a bit too subpar. The barn scene was good where Michael killed the teens making out with farm tools. Other than that I really liked the scene were Jamie and Myers were at the Michael's old abandoned house and Jamie was hiding in the laundry chute and the scene would be even better with an adult. Then Jamie found the funeral scene prepared for her at the attic with Rachel's and another man's dead bodies. Then Dr. Loomis showed up and caught him with net like they'd do in Scooby-Doo.He was in custody and someone in a hat and wearing boots came to the station and exploded the cell to take Michael. We didn't get to see who this is.I like it but I really prefer an adult to be the main character of a slasher so I hope we'll not have Jamie as the main character in the next installment.",Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers
79,DunnDeeDaGreat,After this it was all downhill,5,24 October 2002,"Halloween 5 started the trend of all the movies going downhill and being bad. The script is weak. I mean the whole thing about Jamie knowing when he's gonna kill could have gone somewhere but instead it doesn't. This is about slashing, dicing and it has no tits in it. The ending makes no sense and the series began to suck after this one. For die hard fans only.",Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers
80,mentalcritic,Rehash or remake?,1,20 October 2004,"If you take a look at Moustapha Akkad's credits for the past thirty years, you'll notice a very conspicuous thing. There's only about three films in the entire list that he's executive produced other than the Halloween series. Given that a ninth Halloween film is being planned, I think this says a lot about the actual creativity of the man. Seriously, when a franchise is not working, most creative people move on to something else. Moustapha Akkad therefore looks a lot like the George Lucas of slasher films.Halloween 5 is distinct from the others in the series as being the first since the original to get an R rating in Australia when first released. Unlike the American R rating, a film has to have something fairly hardcore in order to get an R rating from the OFLC. However, the recent DVD release was recently rerated MA, and for good reason. Halloween 5 is one of the mildest films ever to be slapped with an R by the OFLC, and I include every film they've looked at before the existence of the MA rating in that list.Sure, the violence has great impact, and the introduction leaves one wondering how anything human can survive the frankly sadistic beating Myers gets. The problem here is that any story this episode has is borrowed from the previous sequel. Any setup of the characters, including the central hero, is simply dispensed with because the filmmakers assume the viewer, having seen Halloween 4, already knows them. Being that I saw Halloween 5 before Halloween 4, I can attest to the flaws of this approach.Adding to the problems is a tangent with an anonymous, black coated character who strongly suggests that he is a ghost when he rescues Myers. We know absolutely nothing about who this character is, both before or after the end of the film. Then again, given how obvious and telegraphed the rest of the story is, believing an explanation of this anonymous stranger to be beyond the filmmakers' capabilities is pretty reasonable. Then again, even the most incompetent director makes a token effort to keep their plot devices from being this obvious.The most major problem, however, is that this film is just so damned slow. Wheras the slow, languid pace of Halloween was used to build a tense, unnerving atmosphere, Halloween 5 succeeds only in making the viewer itch for a good kill scene. To its credit, Halloween delivers a couple that are memorable, but the inevitable castration by the MPAA also keeps Halloween 5 from being even a good slasher.I gave Halloween 5 a one out of ten. It makes a good prop for classes in how not to build an effective horror show. So it is not entirely without value.",Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers
81,Fernando-Rodrigues,"Its script has more holes than Michael's unif... oh wait, another plot hole.",5,12 August 2021,"Halloween 5 has the most far-fetched script in the franchise. This film was inconsistent and weak, and that was the quality level on the following sequels. The performances are mediocre, and even the acclaimed soundtrack seems apparently in wear and tear. Despite its flaws, I personally like this one, maybe because of the emphasis on supernatural elements.",Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers
82,ODDBear,Mediocre at best,5,10 August 2008,"How much difference several years make. For years I thought this was one of the best Halloween films and having recently gone through the lot of them I'm hard pressed to figure out why I thought so highly of it. It's not terrible but it's easily the least enjoyable entry concerning Michael Myers thus far (Halloween: Resurrection proved to be the series's low point).Beginning immediately after the fourth film ends with Michael once again escaping death and drifting down a river. He winds up comatose for a year (staying in a cabin with some guy) and wakes up just in time for the next Halloween. Then he takes another stab at his niece (Danielle Harris) but Dr. Loomis (Pleasence) is waiting for him. But this time around a mysterious man dressed in black seems to be pursuing Michael and he sports some kind of weird tattoo on his hand.When you consider the fantastic ending of the fourth film it's a real shame the route this film took. It's just another rehash of the excellent fourth entry as Michael pursues his young niece (but he's more than willing to take time off from that chore to dispose of some horny teenagers).Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers was a surprise hit. Designed as a low budget flick to simply cash in a bit more on the franchise, Halloween 4 was a big hit and overall a very good horror film. Director Dwight H. Little put the emphasis on mood and atmosphere and ended up making the second best film in the series. Producer Moustapha Akkad realized the potential and immediately put in motion another entry in the series. The fourth film had a knockout ending where it seemed that Michael's niece was going to follow in her uncle's footsteps as she brutally assaulted her stepmother in Michael Myers style. The filmmakers decided not to take that route and a hack director (Dominique-Othenin Girard) was hired to helm the film.Nothing in Halloween 5 is very special. While the fourth film had mood and atmosphere to spare the fifth flick just plays out it's murder set pieces in an agonizingly long manner. Stalking sequences are far too long and unsuspenseful. There's also a pair of cops who look like a bad version of ""Laurel and Hardy"" and just listen to the music that accompanies those scenes. You have to see it to believe it.Girard doesn't seem very good at generating suspense. His voyeuristic approach (while sometimes looking similar to Carpenter's original) is clumsily done and way too long-winded. The kills are done splendidly but that simply doesn't count for much. The best moments of the film occur near the end when there's a showdown in Michael's old house. A scene involving Michael's niece and a laundry shaft (I think that's what it's called) is very nicely done and really the only suspenseful scene in the entire film. But then the film ends with Michael being freed from prison by the man dressed in black and we're greeted with the Thorn crap that the sixth film tried to make sense of.Danielle Harris is very good as Michael's niece and she plays a difficult part (for a child anyway) to perfection. Her character is a bit annoying in the beginning but she pulls off her role brilliantly. Ellie Cornell is as appealing as she was in the fourth film but her role here is way too short. Pleasence is good, as always, but he admitted that he didn't like the script and simply did what he had to to earn his paycheck.I love the Halloween movies. I can always revisit them and enjoy them, even though not every one of them are good. Halloween 5 missed a golden opportunity to take the series into very interesting territory and we can blame money hungry producers who were afraid that if they deviated from the formula they'd pay the price. That might have happened but I'm sure we would have ended up with a much more interesting film.",Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers
83,fmarkland32,Revenge against his audience...,2,7 November 2006,"Michael Myers didn't die(of course) in the shootout at the end of part 4, instead he was badly injured and after a year of healing, he dusts of the knife and looks to do in his niece who this time is mute and living in a hospital given the trauma faced at the end of part 4. Indeed watching this movie could make anyone catatonic. Like the highly disappointing Halloween 2, this movie has no build up so we just watch as Michael Myers dispatches his victims one by one. Of course as usual, the gore level isn't as high as the Friday The 13th or Nightmare On Elm Street so this becomes an exercise in pure tedium. Also the few interesting ideas the movie has is squandered as they never take off. Halloween 5 is so dull that even the rantings and ham of Pleasance's cant bring much entertainment. The movie in fact isn't so awful as it is uninspired.

84,TOMASBBloodhound,"Watchable, almost in spite of itself.",6,4 November 2018,"Definitely a strange entry in the never-ending Halloween series, part 5 picks up exactly where part 4 leaves off with Michael Myers shot several times before falling into a deep mine shaft or well. Dynamite is dropped into the well, theoretically blowing him to bits, or maybe hell. You'd think that law enforcement would want to recover his body rather than blow him up, but any trace of logic was long gone from the series by then. Naturally Myers survives the explosion and is nursed back to health for a year by some hermit loving along the river Myers escaped to.... I believe the Cinema Sins guys would call this Hermit ex-machina. Anyway, by next Halloween, Myers has recovered from his injuries and goes back to chasing poor little Jamie and slaughtering the teenagers in her life.Jamie, after the trauma of part 4, is now mute and living in a children's hospital. Dr. Loomis is still lurking around, trying to decipher the bond between her and uncle Mike. Donald Pleasance was reportedly too sick to work for very long on this project. Rachel is still around, but unfortunately not for very long. Who are Tina and her friends, exactly? How is Tina seemingly closer to Jamie than even Rachel? Hard to say. Many characters in this episode are not clearly explained, and some of their actions defy any logic at all. But that is ultimately part of the charm of part 5. Whereas Dwight Little and writer Alan McElroy gave a more straight forward narrative in part 4, the new director (a Frenchman with a long name) takes some stranger paths. Some of them work, some are questionable and some are ridiculous and inexpiable. Actors on this set were apparently routinely told that everything they were doing would be explained in the next film. Not!There are just too many things this film does right to dismiss it though. The film aesthetically looks terrific. Autumn looks like it should, even though it was not filmed during that season. Chase scenes are well-filmed and conceived. Plenty of attractive women. Ellie Cornell just out of the shower and lying on a bed in a towel.... mmmmm! There is a good deal more gore than in previous Halloween films, too. Mustapha Akkad seemed to learn from having to shoot additional gore scenes for part 4 after test audiences complained it wasn't graphic enough. Hats off to Danielle Harris, too. Her performances in parts 4 and 5 are some of the best child acting I've seen. So many children make annoying characters, but not her.On the down side... the Man In Black. Need I say more? The comic relief policemen (complete with sound effects, no less!). Losing Rachel 10 minutes in?? Weird decisions, y'all. No less than 3 writers credited may have been the biggest problem. I'll give the whole thing 6 of 10 stars. A perfectly suitable movie to have on in the background while passing out candy to random kids at the door.The Hound.",Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers
85,The_Movie_Cat,"""He'll never die!""",5,31 October 2000,"Contrary to popular belief, the idea of film sequels can occasionally be rewarding. Of course, it helps if they're planned that way, and usually trilogies are the best example of this. Take Krzysztof Kieslowski's Trois couleurs trio of films, or the unofficial Tarantino trilogy of Dogs, True Romance and Pulp Fiction. Some franchises succeed because they operate in a series of self-contained movies, such as James Bond. Yet extending what is essentially the same story past a third instalment rarely succeeds. And does anyone know of a fifth film in an on-going set that manages to rise above rank? The Final Frontier may be underrated, but Battle for the Planet of the Apes was thoroughly lousy.And so it was a pleasant surprise to find out that The Revenge of Michael Myers is by far the best of all the Halloween sequels. Maybe not the best in terms of quality, but certainly in terms of fun. For it seems that by this stage in the series the production team were starting to realise that the somewhat predictable A to B dynamic of the plot was becoming tired. Basically, Myers comes back to his hometown, kills a few people, gets shot by Donald Pleasence and then disappears ready for the sequel. So for the fifth time round, they threw in everything but the proverbial kitchen sink.Two of the best elements of this sequel are the direction (which is the best, and least mainstream, since the original) and the theme tune, once more toned-down after the funked-up disco anthems that constituted the theme from parts 2 to 4. It's only really in the last half an hour where Myers goes into full killing spree mode, so the main thrust of the film keeps it's shocks going through misnomers. Friends tap each other on the back with a short stab of music, or kittens will jump out unexpectedly. In the midst of all this, since the departure of top screamer Jamie Lee Curtis (her character was killed off between films, which makes it odd that she comes back for the seventh), we get lots of fun-loving, sexed-up teenagers, throwing parties and expressing an urge to go skinny-dipping. It could almost be subtitled ""Horny High-Jinx"". Yet in a series where girls find all manner of reasons to take their top off and fall over, this is the only film in the series (apart from H20) not to feature nudity. This despite the fact that it hints at it, with carefully shot shower scenes and a sex romp where they keep their clothes on. It's also one of only three sequels that reach a 90 minute duration.Perhaps what may detract is that of Danielle Harris (who has somehow learnt to act between this and the previous year's ""Return"") sharing a telepathic link with ""Uncle Mike"". Okay, it is daft, and it does conveniently gloss over the fourth's ""shock"" ending, but at this stage of the series Myers has now survived over forty bullets, being hit around the head with rifles, run over by a high-speed truck and a major gas explosion. So having a psychic link with your niece seems quite tame by comparison. Taking this full-on tack to its logical extension, Pleasence's Dr. Loomis is now completely barking. Mind you, it would get you down if you predicted Myers' actions three films running and no one took a blind bit of notice. Then again, Myers doesn't exactly help matters by always attacking on Halloween  couldn't he do it on Shrove Tuesday or something, just to vary his schedule?There are some nice moments where Loomis tries to reason with Myers, and he even shows his face (the audience don't get to see it, however) to Jamie. This brings up the question of ""the rage"", which at least tries to give him some motivation. This has always been the major stumbling block of the Halloween films for me; there being no justification for Myer's actions. Okay, so he's killing his sister, in his mind, (And in a Return of the Jedi-style revelation, Curtis turned out to be his literal sister in the second), but the question remains  why did he kill his sister in the first place?This doesn't, of course, match the original Halloween (1978, 6), which was itself still a rather average tale. Other than the honourable Curtis it isn't terribly well acted, and not quite the ""art house"" work it's often purported to be. Halloween II (1981, 4) took the somewhat unusual step of opening with a jolly, upbeat rendition of ""Mr.Sandman"", ideal music for a horror film, before taking us through a prologue reprise and into the titles where even the pumpkin looked cuddly. It was a straight retread of the first, though lacked it's skill, and the silly third entry (Season of the Witch, 1982, 3) discarded all references to Myers and came up with it's own pointless story. By all accounts, this temporarily killed off the series, with Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers (1988, 4) not emerging until six long years later. This was saddled with the necessary exposition that a franchise resurrecting a seven-year-old storyline would inevitably face. It looked tired, choresome, and was the most mainstream entry of them all.All of which paved the way for a segment that knew Myers was no longer scary and instead opted for randy teens and a comedy police double-act (""Fortunately, we're lousy cops!""). And even though it does tone down the slasher quotient, when Myers does finally appear, the ending proves to be suitably claustrophobic, and a little unnerving. 5/10.",Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers
86,fernandoschiavi,"The fear of the change made this sequel an easy movie to forget, with no memorable scenes or scenes that could serve to make Michael Myers' trajectory more dignified",5,30 August 2021,"Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers had established itself as the most lucrative chapter in the saga so far, and producer Moustapha Akkad was already planning a fifth film for the following year while the fourth was still in theaters. In the rush and desire to keep the wheel turning, when Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers ends its projection, we have only a lazy and irrelevant repetition of the previous one. At the end of the previous movie, Jamie attacks her aunt and the last scene is the girl with bloody scissors in her hands. This ending resembles the camera in the foreground, focused on the face of Tommy, a character (also a child) who survived the third continuation of the saga of the immortal Jason.At that point, Halloween starts to face redundancy. The script by Michael Jacobs, Shem Bitterman and director Dominique Otherin-Girard lacks originality and simply crams new characters and situations down your throat, without any sense of concern about making them interesting or catchy. And worse: the shocking ending of the fourth film offered an ambitious and dark path for Jamie, who had what it takes to be the new killer of the franchise; something that was in fact the original pitch, but unfortunately it was rejected. The producers, however, decided they didn't want Jamie as an assassin.The interest was to resurrect the girl's uncle once more, in ""retreat"" with a beggar in the vicinity of the place where he was massacred at the end of the previous journey. Michael Myers decides to return to attack his niece and the people around her the following year, on October 31st. Thus, it is as if the murder of her stepmother was practically ignored, since not even the psychological ramifications of such a violent act are discussed in the text. The only consequence is a ridiculous gimmick where the little girl has a kind of ""neural connection"" with the killer, being able to see visions of her kills and feel her presence. Complicated...None of the new characters introduced are able to hold our interest, with Rachel (Ellie Cornell) being eliminated in the first act and passing the torch to Tina (Wendy Foxworth), a new friend who is forcefully introduced to form a bond with Jamie. Even though they're both good interpreters, there's nothing there to empathize. With all the foundations in place, the story flows more easily. The psychic link between Jamie and Myers has its ups and downs within the narrative, especially when it comes with a lot of convenience, but it's still something that contributes to the character's mythology. The work Danielle Harris does here at age 12 is impressive. She had already attracted attention in the previous film and, even so, here she surpasses herself given the greatest dramatic demand that her character exists.If Danielle Harris deserves applause, the same cannot be said of Donald Pleasence. The tone used by the character is way above its due and the kind of relationship that Dr. Loomis has with Jamie here is one of bizarre psychological torture. It would be interesting to see the development of the obsession that Loomis developed for Michael, but using Jamie as a channel for this is a strange decision, even though we're talking about an 80s movie. Another point that doesn't work is the need to humanize the main villain. All that scene with that macabre familiar setting and the ""tear"" that the character sheds is all played out. There is no narrative depth or cohesion to justify such scenes. It's all kind of like, ""Oh, let's humanize him, let's make him cry"" ... it's sad. The mystery surrounding Myers' origins and motivations has always been one of the franchise's highlights. Changing that and, above all, in an uninspired way stains the franchise unnecessarily.Compared to the previous film, this one lacks the fickle pace and, despite having a good start and conclusion that bring great horror and suspense sequences, during much of the plot there is a persistent drag atmosphere and with few moments when something really relevant happens. In addition, the film still persists in the lack of explanations for the mysterious connection between Jamie and Myers, in addition to lacking a better deepening in the relationship between Loomis and the young woman, which despite being the focus here, there is not a very elaborate development left several loose ends in the story. Violence, associated with dark scenes, give a dark tone to the production, but are not enough to save it from mediocrity. Michael uses a hay fork, a scythe, scissors and even a car to chase his victims. To try to create something new for the series, a man in black enters the scene, someone who hides in the darkness and who will only have an important role in the final act, with goals outlined in the sixth film.Beyond this doubt, the public will see another new feature: Michael now has a sinister tattoo on his wrist!The photography direction maintains the style of the previous production, knowing how to build a certain expectation and despair in terror, with good scares, however at other times the choice of camera planes and angles is quite systematic and standardized with nothing to add to the narrative. The art direction also continues without much prominence or daring, there are, however, two scenes in particular in which a good use of the sets is noticed, as in the chase sequence in the forest or with Myers' old house that becomes the stage for one of the most harrowing moments in the franchise.In the highlights, there is a very curious scene. Michael Myers is arrested, amazing! The villains in movies of this style are usually tied up, thrown into a lake, blown up, detonated, but in this fourth installment of the series, the villain is arrested, close to the final moments, but, as expected, he manages to escape and secure another row of dead bodies for the next episode, plus profitable financial contracts for those involved in the production. To our surprise, however, the ""faceless enemy"" didn't actually run away, but was captured by an order that in the next movie will explain even more disastrously how the little boy from Haddonfield became a murder-hungry maniac.As the only woman to take over the direction of a chapter in the series, Dominique Othenin-Girard brings nothing new in terms of aesthetics. In fact, the Frenchwoman can barely keep up with the standard of Carpenter and the previous directors, offering generic suspense scenes and without an ounce of tension. The sequence where Jamie is chased by Michael in the basement of the clinic is disastrous due to the director's incessant camera, which allows us to see absolutely nothing of what is happening. And what the hell, production... What's up with the Michael Myers mask?!Halloween 5 could be bold and creative, surprising confrere Jason Voorhees, but the fear of the change made this sequel an easy movie to forget, with no memorable scenes or scenes that could serve to make Michael Myers' trajectory more dignified. And the situation would get worse in the next issue, which nearly buried the babysitter killer forever, a role Rob Zombie would play in the next decade. Michael Myers' Revenge proves to be the weakest chapter yet. It may not even be ridiculous like Halloween, but it's too content to follow a well-worn formula with a generic, charmless execution.",Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers
87,FilmOtaku,What were they thinking??,1,26 August 2003,"After reading that this was supposed to be a horror film, I laughed harder than I did during the film itself.  The goofy cops with their own Hanna-Barbera-esque theme music, the fact that the women were completely adverse to pants and the little girl's bad Harpo Marx impression throughout the film were too much to stand.  Luckily I was watching it with someone and was able to riff on it Mystery Science Theater 3000 style instead of going in the other room and slitting my own wrists out of despair that someone actually wasted precious film on this crap.Maybe if they would have given the little girl a blond curly wig, trench coat and an old car horn to honk I could have at least daydreamed myself into a decent Marx Brothers movie.---Shelly",Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers

Aside from Halloween II being decent and Halloween III being underrated, I personally choose Halloween 4 out of all the films, to be the best of the bunch. Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers isn't exactly as perfect as the previous, but it's a terrific entry of the series. Sure, some of the humor's completely unfunny and the Myers house here wasn't the same as the original, but those flaws don't matter.Everything else turned out fine. Some of the performances are decent with Danille Harris and Donald Pleasance giving out their best performances, the direction is good and gives a much darker atmospheric tone to the film, but it kind of lacks the suspense of both the original and Halloween IV. The scenery is nice, the death scenes are terrific and the music from Alan Horvath along with John Carpenter is amazing with a lot more Gothic tone which makes it terrifying and worth-listening. There is one emotional scene where Michael takes off his mask to reveal his face which made me shed a tear.Overall, Halloween 5 isn't exactly perfect, but it's worth-watching for fans of the first two Halloween films since today's Halloween.",Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers
89,Libretio,"Desperate stuff, the least of the ""Halloween"" franchise - so far...",2,27 February 2005,"HALLOWEEN 5 Aspect ratio: 1.85:1Sound format: Ultra-StereoOne year after his previous rampage, the deranged Michael Myers makes another attempt on the life of his 9 year old niece (Danielle Harris), but is thwarted at every turn by the dedicated Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasence).Filmed almost directly after its mediocre predecessor (HALLOWEEN 4: THE RETURN OF MICHAEL MYERS), this equally routine sequel suffers from poor scriptwork (by Shem Bitterman, Dominique Othenin-Girard and Michael Jacobs) and indifferent direction (by Othenin-Girard, later responsible for burying the ""Omen"" series with his ludicrous TV movie OMEN IV: THE AWAKENING). The plot is rudderless, the 'scare' scenes are trite and predictable, and the impoverished production values result in a flat visual style far removed from the handsome imagery of John Carpenter's original. 11 year old Harris gives another astonishing performance as the primary target of Michael's onslaught, while Pleasence goes through the motions in his usual ultra-professional manner, and Wendy Kaplan excels as Harris' adopted sister, a vivacious party girl who stumbles into Michael's orbit and is immediately targeted for destruction by the unstoppable killer.Producer Moustapha Akkad appears to have been responsible for the introduction of an anonymous character - identified by little more than his silver-capped boots - who steps off a bus near the beginning of the movie and vanishes without explanation following a brief climactic appearance which closes proceedings on a note of utter confusion. Hopes of a quick resolution to this mystery were scuttled when dwindling box-office returns forced the franchise into temporary retirement, until the rights were acquired by genre outfit Dimension Pictures (a division of Miramax) in 1995. Their first attempt at reviving Myers for a new generation, HALLOWEEN: THE CURSE OF MICHAEL MYERS, picked up many of the plot threads left dangling by its increasingly desperate predecessors (including the identity of Mr. Silver-Capped Boots), but was itself no better than either of them.",Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers

The tension and suspense damn near killed me.Not to mention the final ending scene where Jamie cries after realizing that she is now completely alone and everyone protecting her is now dead. That's the most chilling ending of the Halloween series that can only be matched by Halloween 4.If only they didn't disregard Halloween 4's ending in this one.4/5.

91,ersinkdotcom,'Halloween 5' Blu-ray takes series into stale territory and adds absurd subplot,6,27 August 2012,"Everything ""Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers"" accomplished by bringing back the masked knife-wielding maniac with an injection of Hitchcockian suspense was demolished by the fifth installment in the franchise. ""Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers"" is a sad attempt at taking the back story of the killer and expanding upon it. This movie is the perfect example of producers and screenwriters trying to make more out of something than is possible. Anchor Bay's release of the film on Blu-ray gives fans a chance to revisit it and scratch their head in bewilderment at the ridiculous subplot alluded to.A year has passed since Michael Myer's (Don Shanks) young niece Jamie (Danielle Harris) mentally broke down after being stalked by the killer. The attack on her step-mother leads to her admittance into a children's psychiatric hospital. Michael survived the mine collapse and shares a psychic link with Jamie. Now mute, she must find a way to communicate her painful visions to her step-sister (Ellie Cornell) and Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasance). Meanwhile, a strange man arrives in Haddonfield with sinister intentions for Myers.Where part four showed very little, this fifth installment went the other direction and featured Myers visually stabbing his victims with pitchforks, his hands, and butcher knives. Director Dominique Othenin-Girard leaves nothing to the imagination. Besides subtle nuances like the psychic connection between Michael and his niece Jamie and the unnecessary attempt at a subplot with the stranger in black, this is a generic slasher film through and through.Danielle Harris is perfect as the mute Jamie. She thrashes around and cries without making sounds. She is completely convincing in the role. Donald Pleasance delivers a stellar performance in a movie that really doesn't justify his effort. He could've just walked through this one and been better than any of his co-stars minus Harris.What the movie lacks in content quality it makes up for with its superb high-definition audio and video presentation. The picture is clean and vibrant and the 5.1 surround sound enhances the experience with a familiar mix of John Carpenter's signature musical score, the screams of Michael's victims, and the sounds of slashing and crashing.There are enough special features included to get hardcore ""Halloween"" fans excited. Two separate audio commentaries with actors Don Shanks, Danielle Harris, and Jeffrey Landham and director Dominique Othenin-Girard and author Justin Beahm give insight into the making of the film. A featurette entitled ""'Halloween 5:' On the Set"" is also found. There's a theatrical trailer and original promo as well.The new ""Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers"" Blu-ray release spotlights one of the weaker entries in the franchise. It's mildly entertaining and still has excellent performances by Danielle Harris and Donald Pleasance which need to be seen. Just don't expect a repeat of part four's quality going into it and you'll be alright. Fans and completists will find it necessary to pick up this chapter of the Michael Myers' saga immediately.",Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers
92,acidburn-10,Not even one of the best entries in the franchise,5,6 September 2007,"Picking up where part 4 left off The Shape getting shotgunned into a tomb, falling in a river and being found by some bum. The bum babysits Michael for a year, but when Halloween comes he wakes up and his thirst for killing Jamie (Harris) hasn't toned down, he goes on the hunt again. Jamie is now in a hospital, she can't talk and it winds up that she's somehow psychologically linked with her uncle. Loomis (Pleasence) is still around, waiting for Myers and plus we get a mysterious guy dressed in black who enters the film towards the end.Halloween 5 is very disappointing and my least fave apart from part 3 in the entire Halloween series. Halloween 5 is just dull and is obviously rushed in order to cash in on the success of part 4, it has almost no tension apart from when Michael Myers chases his niece around and even they feel rushed and unprofessional and this time around Loomis's ranting feels very redundant, poor Mr. Pleasence, it shows he doesn't want to be on set he's just doing it for the paycheck. The movie is filled with nerve testing characters, from Jamie who can't speak whicgh is very annoying, from her stuttering sidekick (excruciating), to the two comic relief bumbling cops who always show up accompanied by clown like sound effects (what the f..k) but the real test was actually the main character Tina, We are treated with the worst teen to teen dialogue, a lagging pace, awful writing, a Michael that cries and a stupid weird ending that makes no sense and plus no build up.Donald Pleasence (Loomis) seems very unhappy to be there, his performance feels like a throwaway one, but I don't blame himat least he knew he was in a piece of crap. Danielle Harris (Jamie) is solid in this one, yes the fact that she doesn't speak for half the film is testing but she does it good Ellie Cornell (Rachel) plays the only real and sympathetic character in the film, but the director makes the tragic mistake of killing her off within' the first 15 minutes which just spoilt the rest of the film for me. Jonathan Chapin (Mike) gives a one dimensional, poser tough guy performance. I know the part is written that way but I really wanted to beat him silly. Matthew Walker (Spitz) couldn't act his way out of a wet paper bag, Samantha (Tamara Glyn) well she may be stunning but she's a poor actress and last but not least Tina (Wendy Chaplin), well I know a lot of people thought she was terrible but I thought she weren't that bad, yes her character was very annoying at times and she is just another bad bimbo actress but she has heart and goes all out for Jamie in the end and showed some real courage.All in all Halloween 5 is not the worst in the series Halloween 3 holds that honour.",Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers

96,statuskuo,Dismal Entry,3,8 November 2020,"I never saw this in the theater as a kid but ended up watching it on VHS as a double pack between this and IV. A total money grab from Mustapha Akkad.
Not sure whose brainchild it was to have the setting of this place seem so much less like Haddonfield than a town in some remote Canadian border (I believe this was Utah). It looks cheap, the acting is cheap and it gets bizarre.
Here resident Shatner mask donning supernatural psycho Michael Meyers returns to Haddonfield after being blasted by the posse in part IV and miraculously survives a drop into a cave and them some hermit, not hearing the commotion, I guess, revives the guy.How much time has past is beyond me. Why Michael is still in his mechanics duds...still confused. I mean, add a scene where the hermit like tells Michael some bedtime stories or something?! If you're going to get French weird, go full French weird. But, this was a total meh of a movie.
But in some odd way, this was at the cusp of music video/short film directors becoming feature film directors. This would eventually yield people like Michael Bay, David Fincher, Antoine Fuqua and more. So, in some odd way, they did set a trend. To me, this is just so paint-by-numbers it baffled me even as a teen. Where is the gratuitous nudity? Where is the gore? WHY WOULD YOU KILL ELLIE CORNELL? She is the most interesting segue into this entry. Instead, you replace with Wendy Foxworth, as Tina, who feels like the visual translation of nails on a chalkboard.
But there were so many failed opportunities here and felt like the franchise was running out of steam anyway.
It use to be these movies were released around Halloween time to coincide (obviously) with the holiday. To me, it's great fun to anticipate watching these like those Hallmark Holiday movies for ghouls. Instead, it is a bizarre frustrating meandering trog. None of it even feels like a Halloween. IF you watch the entire franchise in order, this one will feel weird. But nothing prepares you for the total garbage that followed.
Danielle Harris, what can I say, I've always loved her as a character. Every interview you watch with her, you just know she is grateful to work in Hollywood. These are the people that keep dumb movies like this watchable.",Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers
97,Rickting,Business as usual,4,29 March 2015,"Halloween is still one of the best horror films ever and one of the only ones which had me holding my breath. Michael Myers, as usual, has survived his supposed demise and a year after Halloween 4, which was a fairly unsubtle hint that the good days of the franchise were gone, Michael Myers returns to go after his niece. Watching Halloween 5 is like watching something through a thick sheet of glass. It's there and it's happening, but you're not connected to it. It's enjoyable enough at times, but mainly Michael Myers stalks teenagers so predictably badly behaved that it's just not interesting anymore in broad daylight with fairly unimaginative cinematography and a curious lack of John Carpenter's Halloween theme tune. Suspense is built up past breaking point, there's not enough atmosphere and it builds up to a conclusion which isn't explained and makes no sense. Audiences had to wait 6 years for the answer to that stupid ending. The direction is barely serviceable and reeks of cliché.Holding it together is Donald Pleasance as Sam Loomis, who does his creepy psychiatrist performance once again to great effect, while Danielle Harris is surprisingly good for a child actor as Michael Myers' unfortunate niece. Michael Myers himself is as effective as ever, and the moment where he takes off his mask surprisingly works. Thankfully it doesn't end with another death and inexplicable resurrection. The finale, including a tense set piece in a laundry chute, is well made and the chase scenes are as entertaining as ever. The writing, however, leaves a lot to be desired. So why do I keep watching these films? Because, the Halloween franchise has a compelling fictional universe. The characters is well written, Michael Myers is an awesome villain and you're interested to see what happens next. Moderately entertaining but weak, Halloween 5 proves that Michael Myers, awesome as he is, should have just stayed dead.4/10",Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers

It's not horrible, but it could also do with some improvement. The young actress playing Jamie is a major improvement in this film, as is the story - perhaps it's the fact that, instead of introducing a new cast in this one, it's building off the cast of the previous entry - but it's far from perfect.Every time we get a sequel further away from the last Jamie Lee Curtis appearance, we continue to stray father and farther away from what Halloween originally was. The things that worked in the original are now tired, the characters are merely cookie-cutter individuals created purely for exposition and kills, and the entire thing is slow-burning itself to what we can only hope will be a satisfying payoff.However, the Jamie storyline of films, although admirable in their ambition and attempts to bring Michael back while still trying to maintain interesting elements throughout, falls victim of the same desensitization, demystification and repetition of all the other horror franchises. What was once a breakthrough classic in horror history has, ultimately, become a commercialized version of what it was, a version that has all but completely forgotten its purpose for existing in the first place.The second film in a row that would've been shut off by the halfway point were it to not carry the Halloween title.",Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers

It's not the worst thing you will watch, it's just OK. Sadly, though I still haven't watched the rest, I feel that story elements introduced in this movie will take things too far.

In this movie Meeker grows on me and becomes in my opinion a better sheriff than Brackett. One negative is there are some typical cheesy 80s scenes that I thought The Return could have cut out. Also, Harris and Billy were somewhat off-putting in some scenes with over-dramatic screams. When it gets to the last thirty or twenty minutes of the film is when its at its best.

Rachel, the other survivor from 4 is sympathetic but unfortunately conforms to the dumb teen status of her friends. Of course Michael is still around, and the killings begin again. Loomis decides to use Jamie as bait to lure and catch Michael, but it now seems that Michael is completely indestructible.Again Harris is superb, the rest of the cast are made to look like amateurs, apart from Pleasance who descends further into madness, but seems to be getting tired with the series. There are enough shocks to prevent the film from becoming another stab flick, but there are the usual unsurprising elements-teens having sex then getting mutilated, characters there with the sole purpose of being killed. The scene in the old house where the police 'guard' Jamie is very good, with Jamie showing she may be the only one capable of protecting herself. We see a different side to Michael, just a glimpse, as Jamie tries to get through to him.

Jamie Lloyd is now in a hospital for children and she's a mute due to the trauma she endured from the year before. Loomis makes check ups on her to see how she's doing. Meanwhile, Michael is being nursed back to health by a hermit in the woods (don't ask). Suddenly, Michael awakes and begins going after his 10 year old niece again. This Halloween is so much like an entry into the Friday the 13th series that you might even forget what film you're watching. The murders are increasingly gory, Michael Myers is more like the Hulk, and everything else is just bad.The only thing that's left over from the previous movies is the score. Everything else has changed in style, for the worse. Michael Myers is now a brutal killing machine instead of a silent stalker. His mask looks utterly terrible and it would inspire bouts of laughter rather than screams of terror. Continuity goes out the window when we see that the once modest looking two story Myers house has transformed into an 18th century Victorian mansion. In this movie, Jamie shares a telepathic bond with her uncle, making the plot more ridiculous than it has to be. The addition of two bumbling police officers with idiot music to accompany them every time they appear takes the mood right out of the film. This movie doesn't feel like a Halloween movie at all.The acting in this film is terrible. The acting in the previous movies (not counting part 3) held up for slasher movie acting, but in this movie it's just like Friday the 13th. The acting is so goofy and unbelievable that you're left shaking your head. Even the great Donald Pleasance delivers a poor performance, but can you blame him? I bet he knew the series was going to hell. But hey, a paycheck's a paycheck right? This movie even dares to compromise everything we've learned about Michael Myers so far by showing him cry! He's supposed to be emotionless. What is the most disappointing aspect of this film you ask? The ending. I'm sure there are tons of people who love the ending of this movie, but I'm not one of them. After seeing Michael shot, stabbed, lit on fire, blown up, etc. you find yourself wondering what great way they're going to kill him this time. Nope, they end up arresting him. We actually see Michael handcuffed like a common criminal in a jail cell. And what happens? The movie turns into Rambo when a mysterious man in black bursts into the police station and kills everybody, breaking Michael out. Who is this man? Where has he been through the rest of the series when Michael was in trouble? Why does he want Michael? I guess we'll just have to wait until Halloween 6. Oh, and for those who haven't seen Halloween 6, trust me...The explanation ain't great.While I will give it the fact that this is one of the most complicated end of movie cliffhangers ever, I can't praise the rest of the movie. I suppose it's half entertaining to slasher fans and fans of the series, but overall it's ill conceived, poorly acted, and poorly written.4/10",Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers

She has developed a mental link with her Uncle Micheal, who's been nursed back to health by a rather nice fisherman, who Micheal thanks by killing him. Jamie senses her Uncle's presence, gaining the interest of Dr Loomis. His worst fears are confirmed as Loyd sees her sister dying and it actually happens. Loomis decides he will use Loyd to capture Myers and eventually the three of them are stuck in Micheal's old home for a thrilling finale, involving coffins, corpses and a locked coal chute. The film then ends nonsensically with a man in black boots kidnapping Myers and Jamie from a prison cell at the end film's conclusion.The script: Uneven. Starts well, meanders through the middle in boring fashion, has a thrilling showdown and then a ludicrous ending.The acting: Harris, as Loyd, is excellent. Pleasance hams it up to great effect as Loomis. Don Shanks is a terrific Micheal. Right shape and great mannerisms. Supportng cast is rubbish, particularly Wendy Kaplan as Tine. Cornell, as Jamie's sister Rachel, was good in Part 4, but under used here.The film making: the scenes with Harris in the mental hospital are effective, the entire chase at the end, form the woods to the house and then in the house, specifically the coal chute was outstanding. The rest of the movie was fairly unremarkable. Shame you couldn't take the chase at the end of this and add it to the end of the fourth one.Overall: Reccomednation to rent. Some of it is ludicrous, but the actual main event of the film, the big chase, is superbly done. There's a ridiculous ending and a lot of pointless exposition to endure along the way.

Too bad the ending sucks and promises a sixth installment that really doesn't even continue from where this one left off. Some of the subplots were highly interesting, and I loved all of the moments with little Jamie and Michael. And of course anything with the late Donald Pleasance was pure cinematic genius. This installment seemed to struggle more with the absence of Jamie Lee Curtis than the fourth movie did. On a whole, the fourth was much more satisfying, creative, original, grotesque, and entertaining. The treatment of one particular character in this fifth film was handled so poorly that I wanted to throw up. It wasn't all bad though, certainly not, and it's definitely not the worst of the series. This fifth installment is just resuming directly where 4 left off, and it fails in so many places that the fourth succeeds that it's hard to not notice the flaws.",Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers

I lost track of the plot, if there was one, about halfway through the film.  All I know is that Michael is running around killing people and his niece can see who the next victim will be. Oh, and Donald Pleasence is still overacting and running around like a goofball.  The ending makes no sense, but you won't care because you will just be happy it's over.

It was nowhere near the quality of the origin or the Halloween 2 but Michael Myers was back. H4 had a real doozy of an ending that was an intriguing setup for Halloween 5.Well, Halloween starts on the same night that H4 ended. Michael had been shot several times in the last film but we see that he is able to escape through a tunnel. Then we see that Jamie, Michael's niece is in a mental institution. She no longer speaks, presumably from the shock from what happened in the last film. She supposedly has a psychic connection to Michael now. Uhuh. Donald Pleasence is back as Dr. Loomis and does almost nothing but act crazy and treat Jamie horribly. Of course, Michael goes around doing his thing looking for Jamie. There are some truly annoying characters in this film. There are a pair of idiot cops in this film that even get their goofy comic music every time they are on screen. Just terrible. I mean this thing does border on parody but it's not funny. There are a couple of decent scenes especially one where Jamie is in a garbage chute that is pretty tense.

115,Rendanlovell,👎,2,17 August 2020,"This sucks man. These last 2 Halloween movies haven't been exactly interesting, but this is like Friday the 13th levels of bad. Being a direct sequel to 4 we have some returning characters here. Including Jamie, the little girl, and Loomis once again.Unlike the last one, which was nothing more then eh, this has nothing going for it. It's stupid, poorly made, tacky, and devoid of an intriguing story. After Jamie killed her step mom, implying that evil is a learned trait, shes now good but in an asylum of sorts. For no reason at all, now she can't speak. This has no real bearing or importance on the story.Said story is simply about Jamie being connected with Michael Myers because why not. That's about it. Tina is also back from the last one and she does very little outside of meandering between scenes. She, like everyone, is superbly bland. No one is even worth talking about. Nor are the kills. Michael Myers wanders around hardly doing anything. He's actually driving Tina's boyfriends car (whose name is Michael lol) for the majority of the film. He is so passive in this it's hard to call this a Halloween movie.So far, this is the worst in a franchise that doesn't exactly specialize in being compelling. The story is undercooked, the characters suck, and it makes absolutely zero sense. It was so bad in fact, that the majority of it was retooled to the point of warranting an entire documentary.

121,happyendingrocks,"No one seems to be able to kill Michael Myers, but this movie pretty much kills his franchise",3,25 October 2012,"Identifying which installment of the Halloween series ushered in the saga's slide into abject idiocy is a no-brainer (yep, this is the one), and you can also pinpoint the precise moment that irrecoverable shift occurs: roughly 40 minutes into The Revenge Of Michael Myers, when the silver-tipped boots of a mysterious Man In Black step off of a bus and onto the streets of Haddonfield.Even aside from the introduction of the subplot that ruined the Michael Myers mythos forever, Halloween 5 takes hearty strides to be the worst entry in the franchise up to this point. The story makes virtually no sense, the logic that drives the key components of the plot ranges from flimsy to asinine, vital characters get killed off without anyone seeming to notice that they're gone for the rest of the film, and the ineptness of Haddonfield's law enforcement is presented to us via ""send in the clowns"" circus music that inexplicably chimes in when they're on camera.A brief exposition reveals how Michael Myers survived being riddled with buckshot at the end of the previous flick: he was nursed back to health by a man who lives in a shack by the river, and The Shape was apparently somehow able to reside with this clueless samaritan for a full year without being discovered or arousing any suspicion from his house-mate. Danielle Harris reprises her role as Michael's traumatized niece Jamie, but while she was a delightfully spunky young heroine in Halloween 4, she's given very little to do here besides shriek and have seizures. After repeatedly stabbing her step-mom with a pair of scissors at the conclusion of part 4 (a savage act which all of the returning cast members are evidently totally cool with) Jamie has been remanded to a children's psychiatric care facility, where she's in the hands of brilliant and capable doctors who see no problem with requiring a young girl who was stalked and nearly murdered by a deranged killer on Halloween night to participate in a festive holiday costume pageant a mere year later.The impending anniversary sparks Michael back into action, and he embarks on a mission to wipe out everyone who survived his last killing spree, and several more people who are simply around to be slaughtered (including a dude with a serious Fonzie fixation). Meanwhile, Jamie's psychic link with her uncle allows her to ""see"" his nefarious deeds while they're taking place, and she sets out to stop his reign of terror (strangely, the impetus for Jamie's intervention is the peril of her stepsister's friend Tina; Jamie's actual stepsister is the first to die, and not only does this fail to spur Jamie on, neither she nor anyone else in the film even mention Rachel again until the very end of this wretched tale).The action is driven by the requisite stabbings and slicings you'll be expecting, but the death scenes are so dully telegraphed that they have very little impact. When the film-makers attempt to integrate suspenseful elements, the results are generally pretty lame, such as the sequence where Michael uses the Fonzie wannabe's car to pick up Tina, who obtusely thinks our lovable killer is her boyfriend wearing a mask. The Shape, having his would-be victim in his clutches and at his mercy, maximizes her vulnerability the way any sensible murderous psychopath would: he stops at a liquor store so she can go in and buy cigarettes, which allows her to get out of the car and promptly be rescued by the police. That same automobile also plays a pivotal role in perhaps the silliest scene in the film, in which Michael chases Jamie down ostensibly intending to run her over, but is somehow unable to get the souped-up muscle car going fast enough to match the speed of a panic-stricken nine year-old girl on foot.One of the saddest aspects of Halloween 5 is how it renders Dr. Loomis a hysterical old coot who desperately needs to be put out to pasture. The Doc's climactic master-plan involves using Jamie as bait to lure Michael back to the abandoned Myers house, at which point Loomis essentially waves off a virtual army of policemen and SWAT troopers to face his nemesis all by himself. Worse, his ploy to finish Michael off involves soothingly counseling him and entreating him to let Jamie ""make the rage go away."" After hearing Loomis expound about Michael being the essence of pure evil and inhumanity for more than 10 years, this pop psychology tactic plays out as a resoundingly foolhardy approach.However, the most grievous crime against the series committed here arrives during the final exchange between Jamie and The Shape, which results in a close-up shot of a tear running down Michael's cheek. So essentially, according to Halloween 5, the emotionless embodiment of murderous fury we've previously seen mow down a few dozen people in cold blood is actually a sensitive monster whose heart melts when someone calls him ""Uncle."" The coda features the true purpose of the Man In Black coming to light when the enigmatic figure uses a machine gun to single-handedly slaughter a building full of cops and busts Michael out of jail. This cliff-hanger guaranteed another sequel would be forthcoming, but considering how awful this one was, that attempt at enticement resonates more like a threat than a promise.If you're a fan of the series, any movie featuring Michael Myers is bound to offer at least a modicum of entertainment, and this entry certainly has a few moments that will keep you from ejecting the disc. But as a whole, Revenge is an absolute train-wreck. Halloween 5 may not be the worst movie ever made, but considering the unabashed disrespect it demonstrates toward the series that preceded it, it very well may be the most disappointing.",Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers
122,Toronto85,Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers,5,3 July 2013,"'Halloween 5' begins immediately where part 4 ended. We see that Michael Myers has indeed survived being shot by state troopers, and has fallen down a mine shaft. He travels along a small river and makes his way to some tent that a homeless person is living in. He falls unconscious for an entire year, until Halloween 1989. Jamie meanwhile has spent the entire year in a state facility for children. She has not spoken one word the whole time. She can now however sense when Michael is near or when he is ready to strike. Anyways,Halloween night approaches and Michael is back in Haddonfield ready to hack and slash anything that gets in his way of murdering Jamie. We meet a younger set of characters (only there to add to the body count) which connect to Rachel from 'Halloween 4'. The film follows them along with Jamie/Loomis leading to an interesting conclusion.'Halloween 5' is definitely the weakest of the original series. So many things that separate it from the rest, and make it less of a worthwhile watch. First of all, this one was scary or even that creepy in the slightest. The previous instalment actually did a great job at creating and establishing an eerie atmosphere. This was a rushed attempt at scary in my opinion. The acting was questionable (to say the least) from the supporting cast. Other than Pleasance and Harris, it wasn't anything to write home about. They also kill off an important character (to me anyways) EARLY on which I hated. Michael Myers himself is also not intimidating at all. Don Shanks did a lackluster job in the role of the shadow. And the Myers house looked like some mausoleum/crypt mansion, nothing like the original. It's an insult to viewers to not even attempt to make it similar. And the kills were not well done, they felt cheap when compared to the first four films (even 'Halloween III' did a greater job...). It's still one that should be seen by all horror and 'Halloween' fans. It has it's moments plus establishes a storyline (the man in black) that carries on into the sixth film.5/10",Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers

124,Gresh854,"Where the Franchise Started Getting ""Bad""",4,30 June 2018,"Halloween 5: The Revenge Of Michaels was a jarring experience, for the most part. The editing in this film seriously was giving me an aneurysm, and that's about the scariest part that happened during the runtime I was watching this movie. The great majority of the film is suffussed with uninspiring cheeseball moments and slapstick (yes, I said slapstick; the film attempts to add comedy into the mix) that is barely endurable. I will however admit that the last 20 minutes of this film were near fantastic. They nearly made up for the abundance of idiocy that was witnessed before, and also contained frightening, sinister moments that reminded me of what made the original so damn spectacular. With that being said, I still conclusively think this movie dropped the bomb. Even Michael Myer's didn't want to properly put on his mask for this one as shown in the actual film. (Tuck in the damn mask for heaven's sake!) We haven't quite hit ""awful"" yet in this franchise, but we've just encountered hitting ""bad."" (Verdict: C-)",Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers

What do you think he's going to do with that when he finds you?"" - Sam LoomisPicking up exactly a year after the wildly successful ""Halloween 4: The Return Of Michael Myers"", the fifth installment has Michael Myers escaping his fate at the end of the previous film, only to be taken in by a hermit who nurses him back to health until the holiday rolls around again. Michael again pursues his niece Jamie (Harris), who is left mute and under psychiatric care after the events of the last film. Dr. Loomis (Pleasence) has plans of his own and in an effort to use Jamie as bait, probably destroys the last shred of sanity he has left.""Halloween 5: The Revenge Of Michael Myers"" suffers from a severe case of sequelitis. Not to say that it isn't a good enough film, because it definitely has some good things going for it, but this is surely where the franchise started to get messy. We are introduced to a mysterious figure, known at the time as the Man in Black, who shares an identical tattoo with Myers, leading into quite possibly one of the worst plot devices in the next film. Aside from that, director Dominique Othenin-Girard takes the series into territory it doesn't belong. In this film, Michael resembles some of the more faceless killers of the 80's, as he stalks horny teenagers in a barn scene that is extremely derivative of the ""Friday the 13th"" series and seems as if he's willing to kill anyone he sees, even if they don't get in his way. Another problem here is we see a certain beloved character get the axe, while the characters who take their place have absolutely no exposition, nor any likable features. Tina (Wendy Kaplan) is one character in particular who is likely to give you a splitting headache before it's all over. Other nit-picky things -- like the horrible mask, wrestler-sized Michael Myers and mansion-esquire Myers house -- I'll overlook for the sake of not complaining too much. In all honesty, ""Halloween 5"" is still a decent flick, and probably the last truly enjoyable entry in the series. Othenin-Girard, despite not knowing what to do with the story, does put on a better show than is expected, with some striking visuals and a few, truly suspenseful scenes (all about the laundry chute!) to counter the more cheesy, slasher clichés on display. Danielle Harris is great again as Jamie Lloyd, and despite reportedly being at odds with the director, Donald Pleasence turns in an excellent performance, with some of his most memorable lines in the series. ""Halloween 5"" makes a nice companion piece to ""Halloween 4"" and you should enjoy it while you can, because six years later, things got messy and the story started to unravel. Badly. Final word is that despite it's slasher-syndrome, ""The Revenge Of Michael Myers"" is still a worthy entry into the series that is a little hard not to enjoy, despite it's flaws.",Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers
126,dormesher-21565,Flawed but enjoyable entry in the franchise,7,7 October 2018,"Halloween 5 The Revenge of Michael Myers in my opinion the weakest entry of the original franchise (Not Including Rob Zombie's) it is an enjoyable film and I do have fun with it and it's Third Act is incredible and Michael once again kicks ass with some great kills.The main negatives I have with this entry In the franchise is how they just ignore that great shock ending in Halloween 4 and make Jamie a mute who now as weird connection with Michael and can sense whenever he is near by an interesting idea and one that does play out really well but not what I was expecting at all from this entry after that great ending in 4 this movie would of been so much better if Jamie had the evil.inside of her this time like it hinted in the end of 4.
Another negative is the fact that they kill one of the greatest characters in the franchise Rachel she was a great final girl in the last entry and they just kill her in this one like she was nothing but a cameo that's so annoying and they replace her with Tina the most annoying character I've seen in a horror Franchise.However the third is incredible with the laundry shoot scene being a highlight of this film and the entire franchise and credit to Danielle Harris for doing that scene because it was a real knife that they was stabbing through the laundry shoot so definitely credit to a kid actor at the time doing that stunt.Donald Pleasance again playing Sam Loomis is just incredible this is a character I can never get bored of watching always entertaining to watch and he is even crazier in this one I love his determination to stop Michael in all of these movies.The look Michael in this one I'm not a fan of something about the mask in this one just looks weird.
I do enjoy the Introduction of the man In black and introducing the Thorn storyline not the best story arc in this franchise and can get a little complicated for Michael Myers but it's very interesting and to be honest really what this franchise needed at this time was different and interesting.Verdict 7/10 flawed movie and the weakest of the franchise for me but still very enjoyable and watchable",Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers
127,Sober-Friend,Wow a better Version of this film is possible I know I made it,7,20 February 2019,"""Halloween 5"" is the worse ""Halloween"" film according to many fans. Now this is not my favorite entry either. The worse sequel to me however is ""Halloween Resurrection"". In fact many fans don't know that ""Halloween Resurrection"" was filmed with 4 different endings but no matter what ending the studio would have picked that film will still be ""terrible"". However ""Halloween 5"" which was released 13 years before ""Resurrection"" had the most promising begging however they didn't go with a set up that the ending ""Halloween 4"" suggested and so we got this disappointing sequel. One of the major reason why this film is not fully loved/liked by fans is because the character of Tina is annoying and so is the characters of ""Spitz"" and the ""Silly Cops"" ""The Man in Black"" and ""A Stupid Ending"".About a month ago I decided ""What if"" I re-edited the film. I cut out as much as ""Tina"" ""The Cops"" ""Spitz"" and eliminate ""The Man Black Angle"". I thought that maybe the film would work better and I went to work. After I was done editing the film it was 14 minutes shorter and plays much better.In this film Jamie and Michael Psychic Link is cut down. The film opens that with Jamie waking up it somehow awakens Michael where he has been hiding. (The Hobo was eliminated)The ending was re-worked. Jamie hears an explosion in the Sheriffs office and she sees all the police are dead and Michael is gone. ""We don't know what happened as an audience"" so its a mystery.Trust me it plays better than it sounds and I loaned it to someone who had never seen it before and thought the film was ""good"". When I loaned him the original version he almost turned it off because he hated the film and found it boring. The first version he said ""It kept moving"".I never told him which version was mine. He thought I took all the deleted scenes and added back into the film. SO he thought the theatrical cut was mine.So at the end of the day if this film can be re-edited into a more enjoyable film then who's to say it can't become a great film if they release the deleted footage.In case you didn't know this film has 15 minutes of footage that has never been scene by the public.

131,FKDZ,Halloween 5: Michael takes his driving license exam.,6,26 October 2020,"Halloween 5 is an interesting movie, It managed to get me a lot more engaged than H4 which just kinda felt meh due to the characters being written quite boringly and the performances being a bit plain. But this movie definitely succeeds with making some fun engaging characters that have a bit of personality. Also without a doubt the lead kid actress really gives it her all this movie and I was a lot more impressed here than her performance in H4.The directing is a little better, once again it has some good shots of michael here and there and a lot more michael in the background which I like. With that the kills are pretty good too, not spectacular but it gets more creative. One of the best being the crazy car fanatic getting teased by Michael when he scratches his car. The pacing is okay it definitely has some unesseracy slow parts but nothing too egregious.The music is pretty good as well but I have absolutely no idea who thought of the idea to add like silly clown sound effects to 2 of the cop scenes. I get these two cops are stupid/lazy but the sound effects are extremely out of place.About the story, rachel gets offed as the first kill and it never really sat right with me throughout the movie, we finally get to see her in a jumpscare reminiscent of H1 where michael put up some bodies like a scary amusement ride. But for a character that survived a whole movie her death scene (1 stab) is very underwhelming. And after that the movie pretty much forgets about her until the end. Now the movie also alters the end scene of H4, which I think is good because well...of course michael isn't gonna be dead the way that movie ended. But after that he finds some cabin kills the guy and goes to sleep for a year I guess.Second is the mysterious stranger that is presumably related to Michael because he also has that tattoo, for him to have the explosives...knowing michael would get put in jail is a bit far fetched. It's also going further into the whole meyers family adding more and more family members because ''plot reasons''. I don't like that.Now a big part of the movie is centered around Tina and her friends, and honestly I didn't hate it I actually thought it was entertaining, the acting is very energetic and a bit out there but it did keep me engaged. It was just a little more interesting than following another plain straight thinking babysitter again which I found boring about H4. But these teens also bring on the few ''interesting'' micheal scenes where he's driving for almost 1/3 of the movie, I thought it was pretty fun and the whole fact she didn't know it was him was a nice dynamic as well. They also did this in the Barn scene but imo didn't really capitalize on it properly.Now about Loomis, his performance is really interesting because it always sounds like he's on his last breath, which is actually really fitting for the character as he is so desperate to fix/get rid off michael. And I really like the final scenes in the myers house involving him. I actually like the slight showings of emotion from michael (except for that weird tear). Or at least that he understands things and is somewhat willing to listen. He can't die, but the fact there is still a very troubled human under that mask made him more interesting again.So for me, this movie actually gets a higher spot than H4 with a 6/10.

Part 4 was just about passable as it followed the idea of the first film, but part 5 tries to take the series in a new direction that makes it totally ridiculous. I have mixed feeling about this film, it has its good moments, but it has far too many that are just ridiculous. Donald Pleasence even seems sick of being in Halloween, as he bumbles on about how evil Michael is and even attempts to persuade Michael to stop killing. There is a good moment when Michael takes off his mask for his niece, but this is very out of place and would have fitted Halloween 2 better than this (ie. too little, too late). There are a few suspenseful moments such as when Michael's niece hides herself in a laundry chute, but mostly Halloween 5 bumbles along seemingly without any direction.

The relatively likable Rachel from the previous sequel is quickly killed to make way for Tina, a deeply unlikable final girl. Tina abandons Jaime to go see her jerk boyfriend, her most egregious sin. The previous ending is largely ignored. The movie attempts to forge some sort of mythology around the Myers character, hinting at the Curse of Thorn and all that other nonsense we'd get in part six. The biggest plot hole, for me anyway, is that we see Michael's face and it isn't burnt to a crisp. Maybe the Shape has a healing factor? The point is, yes, from any sort of objective perspective, ""Halloween 5"" isn't that good a film.Which has little to do with my enjoyment of it. ""Revenge"" is, by far, the most agreeably nutty of any of the sequels. There are so many bizarre choices here. Either production was quickly rushed or the director was going for intentional camp. Exhibit A: The comic relief cops which are introduced with honking, clown shoes music. I love the hermit and his screeching parrot that takes Michael in for a year. Did the Shape spend a whole year passed out in a hobo's hobble? Imagine the fan-fiction that's been written about that. Michael spends an extended amount of time driving a teenage girl around and letting her kiss all over him. Considering he murdered her anachronistic greaser boyfriend, maybe the Shape was horny. The whole Man in Black business is, of course, utter nonsense. But it's likable utter nonsense. No wacky element is more endearing then Donald Pleasence completely sloshed performance as Dr. Loomis. He pushes the character as far as he can this time, pulling a gun on a cop, using innocent Jamie as bait, getting all up in her grill. I absolutely love it.Rewatching the film this time, I realized another reason I enjoy it so much. Most of the other sequels attempt to recapture Carpenter's magic. This one, on the other hand, goes for blatant exploitation. It's the ""Halloween"" version of a ""Friday the 13th"" film. The sex is sexier, the gore is gorier. The teens run off for a raunchy Halloween party, even though you'd think the holiday would be verboten in Haddonfield at this point. The one-note supporting characters, the slasher fodder, are far more broad, playing goofy pranks. Michael Myers has basically been transformed into Jason at this point, impaling a rutting couple and using multiple weapons. The most blatant Jason element is when Jaime reaches Michael's human side, a scene blatantly swiped from ""Friday the 13th Part II."" It's horribly out of character for Myers, of course. He has no human side at all! Don't care. ""Part 5"" delivers the trashy thrills you expect from the fourth sequel in a horror series.The movie is questionable, sure, but I honestly think some elements are very strong. Of all the sequels, this one most captures the autumn spirit to me. The pumpkin carving opening is fantastic. The direction is very strong, the nights thick and black. There are even some genuine thrills. Jaime being stalked by her uncle spirit through the hospital is great. The car chase scene works very well. The laundry chute creates claustrophobic tension. Dr. Loomis delivers another monologue, in which he establishes an inner rage as Michael's motivation. That's as good an explanation as any, says I. Surely I can't be the only one who loves this movie? I perfectly understand why some folks dislike it. By the same accord, I believe its underrated. Not to mention enjoyably goofy.",Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers
134,daworldismine,the most underrated halloween movie,8,26 January 2013,"for some reason quite a few halloween fans dislike this installment of the series, but me i think its one of the best, i think its much better than part 4, so is the mask, i love the mask in this one its creepy, and michael is scary again in this, and very mean, the laundry chute scene is still very tense even to this day. the actor that played michael myers in this is great, the guy in part 4 played him like a clown, i cannot take myers seriously in part 4, but here he's scary again, and i love how you can always seen him in the background its eerie, there are some geniunly unerving scenes in this, and i think its a great movie, and regardless of what most people say i feel its the only other halloween movie that captures the atmosphere and vibe of the first one, sure most people will disagree, but most people's problem with this movie are small little things, as it stands this is an above average slasher with some great creeps and scares, i highly recommend",Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers
135,MovieFan983,"Smart, stylish, sleek, and scary, a good Halloween sequel",7,12 March 1999,"One can love or one can hate Halloween 5. But me, I'm in between. I thought the movie was technically well-made, with a great opening title sequence and moments of true suspense. A pointless, but entertaining sequel, is what Halloween 5 is best described as. But while watching the film, I found it is a worthy and pretty good Halloween installment, marked by good performances especially by Danielle Harris, and as usual Donald Pleasence.The opening sequence is quite clever, with a Michael Myers, slicing and dicing his way through the credits, but slicing a pumpkin. They show the ending of Halloween 4, which shows Mike trying to get in the truck, to which Jamie Lloyd and her stepsister, Rache; are in. They stop, he falls, and stands back up. The police shoot him, and think he is dead. Jamie goes and checks, but Michael grabs Jamie, and the police shoot again, and he falls to his death into a mine shaft. But alas, he's not dead.After the horror and the ending of Halloween 4, young Jamie Lloyd, is in a hospital, and bed-ridden. Still having nightmares about that terrifying night, she still thinks Michael Myers isn't dead, and is coming after her once again to kill her. Dr. Loomis, whose character seems a bit odd in this movie, still is trying to help young Lloyd get away from Mike, and he knows she can sense what he is doing.Michael who is still alive, goes and terrorizes Rachel, and stalks her in her house while she takes a shower. Jamie can sense something is going to happen, and Loomis tries to call her, and she answers, and finds out what Jamie is thinking, she goes and looks, and behold The Shape is there. Well there's Mike's first death.After that, and no one notices that she's dead. Tina, Rachel's best friend, has a costume party to go to and promises Jamie, that Michael will not be there. But of course he is, and he terrorizes and slaughters teens.Tina, and Rachel, along with a boy from the hospital she is in, have to go up against Michael Myers and all his terror, only to find, he's actually a sensitive guy, which you find out, when Jamie begs for her life, and big Mike cries.With Jamie's telekentic persona to her uncle, she, Tina, the boy, and Dr.Loomis, and find out, who and where he is going to kill next. Leading up to a suspenseful finale, and a shocking, but routine ending. And leaves it wide open for Halloween 6.The performances are credible, with the lead by Danielle Harris, like Halloween 4, she does a good job as her tortured by her uncle character. If you haven't seen Halloween 4 here is who she is. Jamie Lloyd is Laurie Strode's daughter (Jamie Lee Curtis from H1 and H2). Laurie Strode died, and Lloyd was adopted, to a family. How they killed or mentions how Laurie Stode died, I don't remember.Donald Pleasence gives a good, but uneven performance as the imfamous Dr. Loomis, who like in the last 3 tracks down Michael Myers, using Jamies pyschic powers. Although he played his character best in the first and second Halloween, in 4 he did a good job, and in this he does too, but he seems weird, or underacting. He sadly only played Dr. Loomis one more time in Halloween 6 before dying.The other supporting performances by Ellie Cornell who plays Rachel, and Wendy Kaplan who plays Tina, they do give some good performances, that are even, and interesting. But I think the stand-out is Danielle Harris, who is probably the most even performance of the movie, and the most realistic.Some of the sequences I liked to, like the opening. The hospital sequence with the laundry shoot, was original, and quite suspenseful. The Barn, and the last car sequences, were also credible and suspenseful. Now the film itself, was well-made, and stylish, it's also a bit far-fetched and overly done, but still it's a good movie, and merits its award of being a worthy Halloween sequel. See it for fun, no more.7 out of 10. Rated R for strong horror violence and gore, and for some sexuality.",Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers
136,MovieFan983,Well I liked it,7,22 February 1999,"A HUGE improvement over part 4, this was a hip, smart, funny, and scary Halloween sequel. The story has from the first film the young Jame Lloyd, the daughter of the deseased Laurie Strode. Like in the first, Michael Myers was going after her to kill her, and in this one, it starts from the last, and she's in a hospital recovering from what happened to her, little does she know Mike is still alive, and is coming after her. The movie itself, was pretty pointless, but unlike the 4th, it was scary, hip, smart, and funny. I liked it, and if you're a true Halloween fan, you will too. 7 out of 10.

137,refinedsugar,Missed Opportunities,5,31 July 2000,"What can I say that hasn't already been said? It's a weak sequel. H5 is by no means the worst of the series, but it's one of those sequels mired by feelings of missed opportunities, bad timing and plum dumb awful choices. Especially after the good comeback showing of H4. It also hasn't benefited from age. It fits the eighties horror movie sequel mold way too well. Cookie-cutter characters with an emphasis on teenagers and a predictable story with the usual foray of stalking, red herrings, ramped up gore and perhaps worst of all, it actually rips off it's genre peer, the ""Friday The 13th"" series. Which I've always felt the Halloween series was superior to. The saddest point is the opening credit sequence which runs for no more than three minutes is easily the best, atmospheric segment of the entire film.The whole thing isn't a complete write-off. A devoted Halloween fan can make arguments for Donald Shanks portrayal of Myers, the mysterious Thorn / Man In Black storyline (where it could have gone, so many possibilities), Danielle Harris and Donald Pleasence's continued presence (if nothing else) and even Alan Howarth's musical score. Then you counterbalance that with everything else. The awful, sloppy story. Wow - butcher the awesome ending from H4 for a starter - nice job. Then there's the cold directing by Girard. The atmosphere is ""off"". This doesn't always feel like a Halloween movie and isn't it supposed to? Stupid teens ... another movie, another mask ... killing Rachel off ... a huge mansion for the Myers house... the clown cops ... ugh, enough said.To say the series doesn't benefit from sequels like this is beyond obvious. We all know this. Sooner of later, people are going to get tired of knowing very well that Michael is never dead, there's going to be a designated survivor (for the next sequel, of course!) and the bunk endings. It's a never ending cycle and they can't even seem to keep the formula simple (much less fresh or entertaining) anymore. Even poor 'ol Donald can't save this one. Only the most hardcore Michael Myers fans will be forgiving of this chapter in the series.",Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers

141,shaun98,An interesting failure,4,30 April 2002,"[major spoilers!!!]""Halloween 5"" is the most uneven entry in the series. Although it has some intriguing elements, it is ultimately done in by its adherence to the ""Friday the 13th"" formula (which, ironically, its progenitor helped establish). The first half is actually fairly interesting, as poor Jamie (Michael Myers' niece) suffers from severe psychic visions following her evil uncle's revival. Up to a point, it's a stylishly directed psychothriller. A bit spotty, to be sure, as the slasher conventions are still there. There's another notable factor that brings up the suspense: which mindset will win out? The psychological aspects, or its more conventional elements? Alas, it was not meant to be. The second half is nearly unwatchable, and the film becomes just another disposable eighties slasher. The barn scene, in particular, drags on for what seems like an eternity. Furthermore, many of Michael's actions seem better suited to Jason, as he disposes of teens with a pitchfork in the aforementioned scene, and a rake in another. Most of the characters are as irritating as you could dread from this type of film. The worst offender is Wendy Kaplan (Tina), who should be barred from ever appearing in another motion picture. Even Donald Pleasance doesn't seem to have his heart in it; he was reportedly at odds with the director and has since disowned the film. Danielle Harris gives it her best, but even she can't sustain the film during its terminal second and third acts. Even the direction falls flat all of a sudden.The latter portion *does* have an occasional good bit, despite my earlier statements. The laundry chute scene is admittedly good. There is also the suggestion that Dr. Loomis may not necessarily be doing the right thing, although I wouldn't hold it against him; his mental facilities are in decline, sad to say. Michael Myers himself may not be entirely outside the grasp of redemption, a bold move to be sure, but certainly a thought-provoking one. I want to make it clear that I focus upon the good ideas, as meager as they are, because the film could have been worthwhile with the proper thought and effort. Alas, the speed in which it was slapped together is all too apparent. The ending makes no sense, and fails to explain the presence of the mysterious Man in Black. Everything is a bit more clear after the subsequent installment, but that does not excuse the filmmakers from not developing the idea further.I'm not going to make a big deal about the fact that Michael survived the ending of the previous film. His next return was inevitable. What irks me is that a classic horror icon has been so ill-served.*1/2 (out of ****)Released by Galaxy International",Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers

144,Lucabrasisleeps,Lowest of the Low,3,26 January 2015,"I am not highly interested in watching sequels. But maybe we could check them out if they continue the story in some meaningful way. Or even bring something different to the table, like Halloween 3 did. Or at least give some big action scenes like Halloween 4. Even then I didn't like the way the child actor was used in Halloween 4. This movie takes it to the limit. Maybe I have had enough. I have had enough of Michael getting up from every shot, coming out every fire. There is a limit to how much crap you can produce with the same premise. I decided to give these slasher sequels a chance because I am more of a horror completist nowadays. But I just couldn't sit through this one. The characters are absolutely annoying. Do real people talk like this? If they do, I don't want to hang around people. What a pathetic bunch of people. And honestly I think after all this nonsense, I think Michael would have been executed or at least an exorcist would have been called to deal with the problem. I am just sick of this movie and its sequels at this point. It is just excruciating to watch the predictable events play out with that little girl being tormented like that. I think, with his kill count, he would have achieved his aims long back. The ending is absolute crap and I can't believe they still want to continue this piece of crap.It is a whole lot of pointless violence and for me, that's not enough for a horror movie.

In the wake of his devastation, his poor, innocent niece Jamie (Danielle Harris) has been rendered mute and forever scarred.

Like ""4"" before, it's another relatively violent affair and the eye of the foreign director certainly gives this one a unique vibe and look. It's a terribly flawed film -- from its plot contrivances to a few annoying characters (oh my god, those cops...) -- but still pretty consistent with what came before.

149,piratecannon,"Dumb, Duh-Duh Dumb",3,27 December 2012,"Halloween 5 takes place one year after its immediate predecessor. We're told in the opening moments that Michael Myers (somehow) survived the onslaught of gunfire that was unleashed upon him by Illinois state troopers at the conclusion of Halloween 4 by crawling out of a sewer drain, floating down a river, and taking shelter in a homeless man's secluded makeshift shanty. Inexplicably, Michael co-exists with this individual for—again—an entire year without incident. Without warning, Michael decides to ""off"" his caretaker without warning so as to pursue his original plan of finally putting an end to the Myers family name with the murder of his niece, Jamie.I have a few questions about this.First, why was it necessary that the movie take place on year later? Wouldn't it have been more feasible (a relative term given the circumstances to be sure) to have Michael lay unconscious for several days before coming to and continuing his reign of terror? Logistically, having him exist in some sort of comatose state for a full calendar year without food, water, or any kind of nutrition seems like an unnecessary stretch; on the flip side, if he were conscious during that time, why would he wait so long to dispatch of this poor sap who would naturally serve as little more than ""creative kill fodder"" for the imposing slasher? Any way you slice it (pun intended) it just doesn't make any sense.Given the ridiculousness of how movies of this type play out, I'll concede that such a complaint could be viewed as a moot point. I only dwell on it here because it serves as the perfect example of just the sort of moronic plot developments that plague the fifth outing of the now dwindling franchise.Jamie, having been placed in a juvenile sanitarium for the attempted murder of her foster mother, now has some kind of magical ESP connection with her mask-wearing uncle. It's explained that Michael is actually the one who forced Jamie to brutally stab her mother with a pair of scissors at the conclusion of the fourth film. In fact, any time Michael is about to do what he does best, she wigs out, and the omniscient (and omnipotent) Dr. Loomis swoops in to decipher her writhing and what it means about Michael's next move. Thrown into the mix is some sort of mystic cowboy, clad in all black, who dons the same Druid-ish tattoo as Michael. The guy roams around Haddonfield, keeping tabs on the now grown up boy wonder, never doing anything of particular note (well, that's not entirely true—he does implement a breakout of Michael from the county jail after the perennial sociopath is finally subdued, but this is confusing, odd, and does nothing to advance the story within the framework of the movie). All of this, I suppose, is designed to serve as a lead-in to the sixth film.If you're scratching your head, rolling your eyes, or doing both at the same time, you're not alone. As things progressed, I found myself increasingly frustrated at the missed opportunities of Halloween 5, as the aftermath of the fourth film's conclusion suggested an interesting new direction for the series that is never made tangible. Instead we're forced to endure a stale entry that's full of logical inconsistencies.All of that said, this entry is still superior to Halloween 3, and methinks that's worth at least an extra half star.",Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers

(THORN) Also I didn't like how Jamie knew what Michael was going to do, that was really bad. the whole THORN thing should have been brought into the series, although that does make Michael's motive make more sense.

It's beautifully shot with lots of atmosphere, but that atmosphere doesn't feel at all like a Halloween movie.

Even in the night scenes you can see the glow of lush green leaves like it's a hot summer night.As for the story, it's too boring and silly to even mention. I spent the entire film looking at all the lush summer greenery and wondering why they couldn't film the movie in October.I'm giving it 2 stars for Donald Pleasance and Danielle Harris even though she has nothing much to do but have seizures whenever Uncle Michael offs someone.",Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers
153,CowherPowerForever,"I Prayed That He Would Burn in Hell. But in My Heart, I Knew That Hell Would Not Have Him",7,23 October 2014,"The following review will contain spoilers.Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers is not one of my favorite films in the Halloween franchise, as it dive off into some absurd plot lines for the sequel to this film, I do generally like the underlying plot and execution delivered in this film. It is no doubt a step down from Halloween 4, the previous film in the series, but it is a film that I can still somewhat enjoy here and there. The following is my review of Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers.The story this time around was written by Michael Jacobs, Dominique Othenin-Girard(also directed the film), and Shem Bitterman. The story in this film continues where part four laves off with Jamie attacking her step mother with a kitchen knife. Much like Michael killed his sister in the original film. After the flashback we fast forward to about exactly one year after the events of Halloween 4. In this film we find out that her step mother did not die, but only suffered some injuries from the attack. An added element to this Halloween film is that Jamie and her Uncle(Michael Myers) share a bound with each other. As Michael is killing people around Jamie, Jamie can feel the presence of Myers with each kill. Connected mentally if you will. I found this plot device to be rather dull and added nothing worth of value. Another added element was the man in black who appears in this film. We see him at the end of the film break Michael out of the prison. This is the first movie we see the Thorn symbol as well, and something that is further explained in the next Halloween movie. The story for the most part stays a good chilling film with some over the top gore at moments here and there. While I don't really enjoy some of the elements that were added, this film does sell the new elements pretty well, and things do come full circle in the next film. Overall, these three writers do a better than average job, although it could have been better.The film was directed by Dominique Othenin-Girard, who is known for such movies as After Darkness and the 1991 made for television movie Omen IV: The Awakening. While his career never really took off, having done a Halloween movie will have his name remembered for the rest of time. Whether in a good or bad light, that is up to us movie fans. The film was directed very nicely with some very good thrills to it. While this film won't be noticed for being the best at keeping the audience scared the entire movie, it does have a nice chilling effect to it. The gore factor is once again turned up for this sequel, and most horror sequels in the 1980s tried to do. While I would say the gore factor is more than in Halloween 4, it still for the most part is not over the top. They try to suck you in with the idea of the kill in most of the deaths, which is something I do enjoy. The acting is once again somewhat bland like in Halloween 4, but Donald Pleasence is once again back to steal the show. This was his second to last time playing the role of Dr. Sam Loomis, and just having him back in this iconic role is more than enough reason to watch this film. Dominique Othenin-Girard won't be getting high praise from me like other directors in this series, but he does a passable job for the most part.Alan Howarth once again returns to mold the score of the classic original that John Carpenter created. Much like the score in part four, the score in this film is nothing to write home about. It adds that chilling effect that the original score added, but there is no risk taking by Howarth like he took on parts two and three. I cannot say the score is bad, and while there are some minor changes to the score over part four, there is nothing that I can call impressive or original like he has done with other sequels in this franchise.In closing, Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers won't be remembered as one of the best films of the franchise, and rightfully so, but in my opinion it is not the worst or near the bottom. Hardcore fans of the franchise like myself should get some enjoyment out of the installment, while viewers who aren't really big fans of the franchises might dislike the movie for the most part.6.5/10",Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers

155,BlueSkies765,Atmospheric,10,17 March 2019,In the Halloween Universe I always feel that every movie is its own world. There's a lack of plot with part 5. It's simply about The Shape terrorizing Haddonfield. What gives this movie identity is that its got some of the creepiest scenes in the franchise. It's one of the darkest movies in the franchise.

This will be the last time I'll ever watch Halloween 5. I can't tolerate parts 4 onwards. Remind me again, how many did they go up to? I forget. 11 or 12, wasn't it?I get really annoyed when I watch these sequels and it's all because of you, the fans! You all revolted and kicked up a fuss after part 3 like pouty little school children just because your boy, Myers, wasn't in part 3. But you got your way in the end and this is what you were rewarded with - from absurd to stupid sequel after sequel of the same story line with the white masked killer doing the same thing in every movie. Part 5 no exception. (Didn't he die at the end of part 2 in the hospital?) Hope you're all happy with yourselves. You fanboys deprived us of other similar ""Season Of The Witch"" storylines with your tantrum, and want, for Michael Myers.The hermit who lives with his parrot ""Sooky"" looks like Ed Gein. This scene was so convoluted and confused that they were originally gonna have some actor who looked like the lead singer from ""The Clash"" mentor and heal Myers but they just went with the banal Ed Gein fella storyline as the director obviously didn't know what he was doing to even begin with. (Could that clown-faced weirdo have saved this movie if he were in it?)I can't believe I'm watching this. Let the absurdity begin. Did you know that Fangoria equated this movie to child abuse? And it is. Plain and simple.Oh, so Myers has a tattoo that can telepathically request a little mute child to kill on demand? When did Myers go into a tattoo parlor to have this ink done?The mute child killer forgot to abbreviate ""Hes coming for me."" Loomis is introduced, sporting a roadside diner fried egg on his face. (Didn't he die alongside Myers in part 2 as well?) Some unknown hoodlum wiretaps a message to the mute killer child which reads, ""THE EVIL CHILD MUST DIE."" The word must is underscored to emphasis it's seriousness.This Tina actress is as ditzy as they come and the lines written for her are unprofessional. In fact, the whole cast are all amateurs with horrible dialogue given.The mute child is playing an adult version of hide-and-seek with Myers already. ""Tag, you're it."" Only Myers ain't playing. Or is it just a dream sequence?Even Loomis is terrorising the mute killer child now. It's painful to watch.Wyatt Earp just stepped off a bus and there's animal cruelty. This movie has everything.Can someone tell me how this pointless, wasted, exercise of a movie is connected to H20, or Resurrection? Oh that's right, this leads into that atrocious part 6. What was part 7 then? Oh, the one where Tina uses telekinesis to torment, oh wait, that's the hockey mask guy - leather Face. (Those sequels blew out of proportion, too.)
Wow, Myers is chasing kids in a car through an orchard crop. This defies belief and suspends my brain between somewhere and nowhere. Can I visit ""Total Recall"" and have my memory erased? Are they still offering those trips to Mars?Don Shanks, eh? Weren't he in ""The Life and Times of Grizzly Adams?"" A bear, or bobcat, pushed him off a mountain?Sorry but I have to fast forward this laundry chute scene. I'd rather chain an anchor around my neck and dive into the ocean than watch this embarrassment. This isn't even frightening.Ohhh, how touching, Myers is shedding a tear. Didn't he get stabbed in the eye with a coat hanger in the original? And where are all the burn marks around his eye from part 2's ending?I can't even be bothered mentioning the ending with Machine Gun Kelly and his Tommygun. Or why the cops failed to remove his mask when arrested.This sequel is atrocious.The defence rests.I have no further comments your honor.",Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers
158,scott-sw,"Decent effort, but falls apart at the end.",6,29 December 2007,"Not many people realize that Moustapha Akkad, who produced the first Halloween movie fought with John Carpenter for copyrights for years before winning the right to shoot the Halloween 4 and 5 sequels. I wish John would have won. In Halloween 4, Michael makes a fairly decent return. However, Halloween 5 shows (like in Halloween 2), that Hollywood does not know when to leave something alone. First, Michael Meyers betrays his character. In the first movies, he kills to set a trap, when he's cornered, splits up his victims, and relies on brute strength. The scene where he stabs a couple with a pitchfork (and they are sure to use a condom) is a farce. The most ridiculous is when he chases his victims down with the car. The movie was opposite in its predecessor. While Halloween IV starts out good and falls apart, this one starts poorly but gets better towards the end. At the outset, I must congratulate Danielle Harris who plays Jamie. She is an outstanding young talent who can be scared, strong, and courageous all at the same time. There are also some neat camera tricks and new things (like moving in and out of the trees). Also, there are some really tense scenes when he returns home and chases his niece, Jamie. In fact, the return to the Myers house has one of the most intense, suspenseful scenes when Jamie tries to hide in the laundry chute. The personality almost returns when she reaches out to ""Uncle."" The suspense is almost breathless. What will he do? Michael almost comes back in another scene when his old nemesis, Dr. Loomis tries to reach Michael again. It truly shows that Michael has the personality that Jason never had. There are some big problems, though, which really hinder this movie. The script was rushed to be released a year after Halloween 4, and it shows. The Myer's house somehow has transformed to a gothic-style manor instead of the simple 1950's look of the original. A more serious sin was the death of Rachel (Ellie Cornell) who was a far superior protector of Jamie. In this one, we have Wendy Kaplan playing Tina, the new protector who is the MOST annoying character. However, the biggest downfall is now a mysterious stranger with an unusual tattoo. Moreover, Michael has the same tattoo. I find it odd no one ever noticed it before. Shouldn't it have been burned off because of the Ether explosion in Halloween II? In the end, Michael escapes. Just let him wander.",Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers
159,mrskywalker,Classic Series,7,29 October 2002,"1, 2, and 4 were the best.  5 is also good regardless of the comments.  The little girl is perhaps the best of all screen horror children surpassing Poltergeist and Linda blair in the Exorcist.  Donald Pleasence is one of the great actors of all time adding incredible class to the series.  He is in the league of Peter Cushing and Cristopher Lee.  A true great in which the series is meaningless without him.Halloween 5 spends too much time on teenyboppers with a little too much stuff borrowed from Friday the 13th with silly teen lust combined with slasher stuff.  But this film excells when it cuts to the real story of Meyers chasing the girl and the doctor's relentless pursuit.  Thank goodness it refrains from too much extreme gore ad special effects which has hurt horror so much in maby other films.Meyers here is madder than usual and more hyper.  He also commits some murders that make him a truly hated figure to me.  Spoiler:  At the end I wished there would have been another quick sequel and really wanted to know what would happen especially to the little girl and the doctor.  I know that there would not be another Halloween for 8 years so I do not really know.  I have not seen 6 yet but I fear 8 years is too long to remain relevant to the little girl's story.  4 and 5 makes you really want to meet the doctor and the little girl as if they were real people.  Perhaps that is the most haunting thing in the series.  Now that Pleasance has really died one can only wonder that movies can in some ways can be far more than movies.",Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers

I really love the Halloween franchise, it was a great idea by John Carpenter and Debra Hill that was then dissected by other directors (with the exception of Rick Rosenthal). The direction the director went with this movie is strange, there are still the same old themes (murders, Halloween time, Dr. Loomis, the Strode/Myers Family dispute) but this time the movie and Michael both take on a whole new image. I will not spoil this movie for anyone so I will let you just watch it and make your own assessment as to what you think. Overall it wasn't bad at all.",Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers

164,Phantasm01,I knew that hell would not have him,8,2 August 2006,"There are clearly a few problems with this movie, but I hardly noticed them at the time of its original release. I left the theatre more excited about this movie than any horror movie I had yet seen. The ending caught me totally by surprise and had my little circle of friends (all two of us) speculating over its implications for many days thereafter. To say that this movie left things a little up in the air would be a misstatement of massive proportions. Not only was I left to ponder the fate of Michael, Dr. Loomis, and little Jamie, I was mystified by ""the man in black."" Who was he? What was his role in all of this? I still think the concluding 10 minutes of this movie are the best 10 minutes of the entire Halloween series, although I would not dare place this movie on the same pedestal as the original film, which is basically untouchable by all pretenders to the horror crown.I have nothing but the greatest respect for nine-year-old Danielle Harris. The makers of Halloween 5 put this poor girl through the wringer, and she shines from start to finish in one of the most physical roles I have ever seen man, woman, or child play. As the movie opens, she is living in a children's clinic, unable to talk since the shocking events of the previous Halloween night and increasingly prone to seizures and fits brought on by some kind of psychic connection with her uncle Michael. Eventually, she finds herself running for her life as her uncle chases her down with a car and then his trusty knife. Then toward the end comes the unforgettable scene in which she finds herself lodged in a laundry chute inside the abandoned Myers house desperately trying to stay alive. The depth of emotion and sense of utter terror she is able to convey is really quite extraordinary I have to admit I didn't particularly care for this incarnation of Michael. No man can compare to the original Shape, Nick Castle, but the real problem for me in this movie is Michael's mask. It just hangs loosely around his neck, and the sight of it flopping out on both sides like an extra pair of very large earlobes really kept me from seeing this masked killer as the Michael I know and love. Donald Pleasance is, as usual, incredible as Dr. Loomis. I admit, Loomis seems to be getting a little bit loony by this point in the series, but who can blame him? Every time, he tells the authorities what is going to happen, yet no one ever believes him until it is too late. Bearing the scars of previous encounters with Michael, his bravery and obsession with Michael Myers earns him five stars in my book every single time.Here are a few ""problems"" with this movie. Let's start with the obvious. What is wrong with the people in Haddonfield? It is very important to keep in mind the fact that no body was ever found of a seemingly vanquished Michael after the events of the previous year. Rachel, having barely lived through Halloween 4, not only leaves a spare key to her house on top of the doorframe, she leaves the door wide open while she is taking a shower. Then there are these moronic teenagers consuming far too much of our time. They insist on playing practical jokes on each other and even on the cops, finding the whole Boogeyman subject incredibly funny for some reason unknown to me. It's hard not to cheer for Michael as he goes after these goofs. Tina is incredibly immature, her boyfriend with the car fetish is unbearable, and her horny friends annoyed me as much as they apparently annoyed Michael. Then we come to the cops. Apparently, Michael's previous adventures have decimated the local police force because they are letting some incompetent people wear a badge these days. Hearing some type of obvious clown music play when the two ""super cops"" first appear is basically unforgivable as far as I'm concerned. Apparently, these two characters were supposed to supply some comic relief to a movie that needed nothing of the kind.Overall, I think this movie has moments of greatness that, for the most part, make up for its flaws. Danielle Harris is amazing, and the final 10-15 minutes are riveting. More than anything, though, I have to return to the fact that I left the movie theatre all those years ago totally excited about this movie and its mysterious twists and turns. Any slasher movie that can inspire untold hours of speculation after the fact has achieved something quite rare indeed.",Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers
165,BenTramerLives78,Halloween 5 Is Possibly The Worst Of The Series,5,30 March 2021,"Halloween 4 was a decent sequel to the first two films and was a great film to reintroduce Michael Myers. Halloween 5 should have been a good film in the franchise, but sadly it was not. Halloween 5 suffered mostly from having a clueless director who wanted to take the film in a different direction and started an idea that was never finished and was left for the makers of Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers (1995) to finish.I know the films are not based in reality but are we really supposed to believe that Myers spends one entire year in a hobo's cabin in the same spot asleep and then all of a sudden wakes up and kills the old man? It makes no sense whatsoever.Jamie is in a hospital where she is mute and is now experiencing a psychic connection to her uncle. Dr. Loomis is full on crazy at this point. Rachel's character isn't used at all the way she should have been and now has an annoying friend named Tina. The film, in my opinion, is a mess.

166,Kirollos-Noah,A terrible movie!,1,31 October 2019,"Happy Halloween, and welcome to my review of the movie that took the whole franchise down, Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers.Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers was directed by Dominique Othenin-Girard, written by Michael Jacobs, Dominique Othenin-Girard and Shem Bitterman. And starring Donald Pleasence, Danielle Harris and Ellie Cornell.H5 takes place One year after the events of Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers (1988), the Shape returns to Haddonfield once again in an attempt to kill his now-mute niece.Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers is such a disappointing movie, and I'm not here just to trash this movie, and talk about how this movie is disappointed me, or any other fan of this long-dead franchise, I'm here to talk about how this movie is a failure, not from a fan's perspective, but from a reviewer's perspective.H5 is made the franchise officially a supernatural franchise, yeah I know it always was, Michael Myers never died, not by fire, not by six shots, not by anything.. but now his's psychologically connected to his niece, which made her do what she did in the previous movie, which wasn't also explained well enough, but just that.. they're connected in a way or another, and that's not just it.. Jaime is doing some weird stuff throughout the whole movie, it's just because of a touch, so whoever who touches Michael Myers turns into a killer like him and do some weird things too? Michael Myers is what now.. a disease? The plot couldn't get any weirder!The Shape's mask is once again changed, but now the movie takes place right after the events of H4, so how did he suddenly change his mask? I mean he wasn't in the town yet, a guy saved him and he took off his mask, and The Shape wakes up and all of a sudden, he wore the mask that he was supposed to be wearing in the previous one, but this time, it's different! What were they thinking about? They just wanted to change the mask after all the criticism they got because of it, I understand that, but there were million ways to do that, at least a one that makes sense.The Shape now is a guy who's killing random people, the point that bugged me in H4 and Halloween 2018 is now all over the place, Michael Myers is now less scary, and the movie lost all the suspense that the first and the second one had, even the fourth was even more suspenseful than H5, even the thrills are so lost, you can say that they even poorly tried, because the third one had a better suspense, because they at least tried to make a thriller, but this one is so lost in its supernatural connection and that aimless plot that took me off the movie!Even the performances are cringe-worthy, everyone in this movie did a terrible job in this movie, especially Donald Pleasence, he's now officially obsessed with Michael Myers, and whenever he's in a scene it's full of bizarre dialogue and weird performance, Dr. Loomis, the once-was my favorite character is now a weird guy, screaming everywhere, and now he know's everything about Michael Myers, he knows that he's connected with Jaime, and we don't know how does he know all of that, he just does, because that's his character... What have they done to this franchise??This movie is filled with cringe-worthy performances, and a terrible script, this movie is so poorly written, the script is so bad and the dialogue is so bad, with the actors' acting, the movie was so hard to bare, the movie is incredibly boring, and so hard to watch!Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers is a terrible movie, it brought down the whole franchise with its embarrassing plot, and its laughable dialogue and with its cringe-worthy performances!Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers of course gets an F! This movie makes the previous 2 look good, and I'm so sad to say that, but in a way this movie is entertaining to watch, but in all the wrong ways!Happy Halloween, everybody.. enjoy your Halloween night with your family and friends...

Whoa.... This is very much like a Friday the 13th movie with teens partying and then getting slaughtered, and the mask , what's wrong with that huh?, it looks more like LeatherFace mask than Michael Myers mask, and the crazy music when the two cops were first introduced was exactly like something out of the Lame Friday the 13th movies. Right now, I liked this movie a lot, Michael Has obviously survived the events at the end of Halloween 4, and lies dormant for a year then he awakes and hell breaks loose on Haddonfield once more...... He started of killing a guy who looked after him for a year then he Killed the Major character from Halloween 4, Rachel. But he does not have the complete upper hand his niece Jamie now has a telepathic connection with him and can tell what he's going to do next, then there is Dr. Loomis who is a complete maniac in this movie intent on killing Michael once and for all. The part that I liked the most was where Jamie and Michael bond !!! She talks to him and asks to look at him without his mask and she tells him that they are the same, and the poor guy cries, but then Jamie falls over and Michael gets stressed out.......

Are we expected to believe she would be held in a low security hospital only 1 year after that? And what happened to her evil side? It was never really explained how she became good again or why she was mute for much of the movie.The Loomis character appeared to be a bit deranged and psychotic in this chapter. I didn't like him at all I thought he was a bit cruel to Jamie at times i.e. shaking her and telling her to speak when he knows she cant. No doctor would be allowed near a sick child if he was abusive.I also feel the police would take more drastic measures than simply trying to shoot Michael since that never works, like sending in the army with rocket launchers.Quite a bit of sex in this movie which is a first for the Halloween series.

Loomis is there also, screaming at her and then you realise they probably were going to kill off Michael Myers in the last movie and let Jamie take the torch (knife) but they realised that's a horrible idea.So Michael is back after some sleepy time with a hobo guy down the river (this all happens in the movie) and is still after Jamie.

Michael ended up in a river and got himself to shore. And suddenly, he caught sight of a mountain man and attacked him. And at that very moment, while Jamie Lloyd (Danielle Harris)was at a children's clinic in Haddonfield, she could see that moment. She can see what Michael can see.On the following day, her foster sister Rachel Carruthers ( Ellie Cornell) came to visit followed by her friend, Tina Williams (Wendy Kaplan).They bought her a dress for the Goblin Costume Pageant. Now, Jamie cannot speak due to her previous incident with her Uncle, Michael and therefore; she can only communicate with sign language.There were some real freaky parts in this film e.g- someone threw a brick through the window with a message on it saying: ""The evil child must die!"" Another was when Rachel got home and Jamie's dog Max started to bark at a tree and Rachel did not see what Max was barking at. It was Michael. another was when Michael got inside the house while Mr and Mrs. Carruthers were away for the weekend and was everywhere where Rachel went e.g- watching Rachel while he was in the the closet as Rachel was thinking of what clothes she was going to wear. And again, Jamie could see what Michael was doing and Rachel got a call from Dr.Loomis ( Donald Pleasance) that she get out of the house. And finally, after the cops left; Rachel went into Jamie's old bedroom and found Jamie's photo shattered and when she turned around, Michael STABBED HER, with a pair of scissors! And now, Michael is after Tina.Another thing that freaked me out was when Michael visited the Children's Clinic and when Jamie tried to escape; all the doors were locked. And to end the moment, Jamie saw her uncle's shadow everywhere on every sheet in the laundry room and thank god Jamie was still found alive and well! And another was when Michael attacked Tina's boyfriend Mikey ( Jonathan Chapin) with a garden tool. And finally, when Tina was picked up to go to the Tower Farm, she didn't know it was Michael who fetched her, not Mikey! And at the Goblin Costume Pageant, Jamie saw it happen through Michael's eyes and she shrieked.At the Tower Farm, two annoying brats named Samantha Thoman ( Tamara Glynn) and her boyfriend played a prank on the cops to do with Michael. You should see how annoying they were! And then, they got killed in the barn next door to the party while having sex and same thing what happened with the cops.Soon, Jamie and her friend Billy (Jeffery Landman)arrived and then Michael came careering out of nowhere and headed for Tina followed by Billy and then Jamie and she was chased through the woods with Tina shrieking as she ran behind. Suddenly, Michael crashes and Tina jumps up and defends Jamie and she got stabbed.Later, at Michael's house ( pity that it doesn't look the same); Jamie was waiting in the top room for Michael and then, he came. Michael didn't know this was a trap for him! It was very spooky when Jamie found dead Max, Mikey and Rachel in the attic and in the middle was a casket. Jamie got into the casket and asked Michael if she could see his face and he did reveal himself. Jamie looked just like him. And then, Michael tried to attack Jamie and then Loomis got hold of Jamie and took her all the way downstairs with Michael following them and then WHAM!Michael was caught with a net made of chains and he got beaten to death by Loomis and then Loomis passed out.And to end the movie, Michael was put in prison and then, a mysterious person entered the jail and there were gunshots heard from inside.Jamie was outside. And when she went to go see what the trouble was, she saw every passage was littered with cop bodies and she noticed that Michael had escaped from prison! If you are wanting to buy a real horror video, buy Halloween 5!This movie has been made for the ones hard at heart, if you aren't then Halloween 5 is not for you! What a great movie! the acting was outstanding!",Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers

173,PlayerSS,Mistakes were made,5,27 September 2003,"This one was where things started to go bad. It introduced the man in black and the early stages of the soon to be curse-of-thorn idea. Danielle Harris (just like in the 4th movie) made this movie. She was a very good child actress. Pleasance also returned as Loomis. This was not one of Pleasance's better Halloween performances.  Michael's (real) face was showed way too much. All of the kills were weak. How come they didn't show the sickle death? That could have been one of the better deaths in the movie. I also didn't like how Michael was much smarter in this movie than he ever has been. He was also more built than he ever has been. I didn't care to much for the built muscular Michael after seeing him as a skinny type murderer for so long.The switching of the mask in the car was sort of pointless in my opinion. He over-used the car too much. He usually kills with sharp objects and knives. Now, all of a sudden, he is using a car to run people down. From the start of the Halloween series, Loomis preaches about Michael. ""You've never seen his blank stare. His emotionless face."" Now Jamie can make him cry. That goes against everything Loomis preached about from the beginning.One of the victims is named Mike (i.e. Michael) which, of course, sets up a scene later for some Myers confusion. I thought that could have been left out. The Man in black was shown very seldom. There was not much build up around him. He was being saved for part 6.  I don't hate this movie although it could have been better. Seeing this movie did make me like part 6 a little better actually. This is one of the weaker movies out of the Halloween series with Michael in it.",Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers

It's not all that bad but it's stupid compared to the first. It's confusing at times with different people that weren't in the last movie. It doesn't explain much about what happened at the end of the last movie. It's got it's moments that scare the crap out of you but the plot is so lame, the acting so bad, and the look of the part in the barn is like a rip-off of one of the worst horror movie ever, Friday the 13th.

175,MissCzarChasm,Are we sure this is a Sequel to Halloween 4?,5,30 April 2002,"***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** Halloween 4, my favorite sequel of the bunch, was a pretty good slasher film. It mad Halloween hip again, made Myers scary again, and presented us with the most shocking endings in a horror film in a long while. The way that film ended i was just sure that when the 5th Halloween was to be released they were going to do something new and exciting with it.
Unfortunately for us Halloween fans the filmmakers chickened out. They practially abandoned what they ended with in the previous installment and did this business as usual. To call this a sequel to the far more superior 4th installment is an insult. Why did things go horribly wrong, espcially since these films were shot and released within months of each other.
Halloween 5 does a few things right. It picks up where the 4th one left off. However the actual ending of the 4th film is given screentime in a flashback in the beginning but is totally ignored throughout the rest of the film. The performances are pretty dead on. Danielle Harris is even better than she was int he 4th installment. A very solid thespian for someone at a such a young age. Donald Pleasance presence is good thing in any Halloween film but his deranged bit that was used well in the 4th installment is slightly over-played in this film. There are 2 fairly good stalk sequences. *POTENTIAL SPOILER* One with Jamie trapped in a cellar as Michael stabs through it trying to get to his prey. The other being Myers trying to run Jamie down as she runs away in extreme terror. *END SPOILER*.THE BAD HOWEVER MOST DEFINITELY OUTWEIGHS THE GOOD UNFORTUNATELY. Myers just isn't scary in this installment. He actually put chills down my spine in the 4th film however is this one it's the equivalent of a bum trying to hunt you down. The mask is also all wrong. It looks too goofy. The teenage characters are too annoying for words. When they're on screen i was rooting for Michael to take them out. One character that everyone thought was annoying was Tina. She was slightly nerve-wracking but her sacifice in the end made her a fairly likable character in the end. The movie is extremely slow. i understand when movies move gradually to build suspense but there are scenes in this film that just waste time. Such as the scenes with the two goofy cops. what was that all about? I understand that a series in its 5th installment needs to go into a new direction to stay fresh but the direction this film goes in is totally wrong. They should've stuck with the ending of part 4 and done something with that instead we get a new plot twist(""the man in black"") that is revealed in the 6th film but this plot thread buried the 5th and 6th film in my opinion. It just seems out of place.
*SPOILER*Their biggest mistake was A)Killing off Rachel and B) If you're going to kill her don't kill her so early in the film. She was the heart and soul in the 4th film and she is killed within the first 20 minutes. Big mistake on the filmmakers part.As you can see i was very disappointed with this film especially since it followed the far superior 4th installement. In the case of this series i'm glad they kept making films until they got to H20 just so they could finally do one worth watching.",Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers
176,jmcgee-1,The WORST In The Series!,5,22 January 2004,"After Michael's icredible return in HALLOWEEN 4:THE RETURN OF MICHAEL MYERS,fans were yet again craving for some more.Have you ever heard of becareful what you wish for.With director Dominique Othenin-Girard and writers Shem Bitterman and Michael Jacobs,you'll expect a great sequel right.Not.

177,Finntroll,Boring and uninspired.,4,11 July 2004,"Michael Myers is back! Who would ever have thought that? Anyway, this time he's out to kill a little girl who is bound to him by psychological powers, of course he's not content with this. Michael, the good fella he just happens to be, walks around and kill almost everyone you'll ever see in this movie, which, of course, is very good since almost every person who appears on screen is either a complete and utter @rsehole or just very painful to behold. The acting is pretty stinky here, Donald Pleasence is the only one who manages to make his character remotely interesting, supporting actors have a hard time doing anything else for their characters than making me wish for their death.A thing that made this movie a bit worse was the fact that Myers acted exactly like Jason, he probably lost his big knife somewhere because he's slaying with everything from a schythe to gardening tools. OK, the knife was never very original in itself but it was Myers's trademark for crying out loud! Myers without a big knife is like a roman emperor without orgies or a festival without mud. It just doesn't seem right.Anyway Halloween 5 had one creepy scene where Myers is spying on some girls but that's really all terror there is and it's all downhill from here.And for the gore; there's just to little to keep me interested.
This movie will probably work just fine if your out for the cheap thrills of watching stupid idiots getting whacked and repelling women screaming in terror, but it's pretty weak both as a horror movie and as a goreflick so don't blame me if you don't like it, because I warned you!4/10",Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers

Michael just barely escaped the explosives, and now he wants revenge. Not as pointless as you may think, it still carries the first Halloween movie's plot with it.

Too many things in this movie just don't make sense, or are completely absurd.  minor spoilersFor one, there are too many errors in the movie, such as Mike Myers becomming a stunt driver, day changing into night in a matter of seconds, and a mysterious comboy bounty hunter type that seems to bust myers out of jail at the end.

(Even though Michael never speaks, obviously.) There's a big emotional moment between the two of them, and I believe that's the heart of the whole movie- the one final attempt by Loomis to change Michael.

182,Chris-332,Mediocre movie.,5,18 July 1999,"I am one of the few people who likes this movie better than Halloween 4, which I thought was pretty pitiful. But that does not make this a good movie. Halloween 5 lacks in a lot of places that the other sequels did much better, even the fourth one. The suspense in this movie sucks. It wasn't scary at all. But it was more entertaining than some of the other sequels of the original classic. The scene where Jamie Lloyd goes down the laundry shoot was cool. The scene where Michael takes off his mask is pretty cool, too. I'm glad you never saw his face. I didn't like the new house which was supposed to be the Myers' Place. The beginning was also really dumb when he meets the old man in the cottage. That was straight out of Bride of Frankenstein. I'm surprised he didn't teach Michael how to talk. Anyway, Halloween 5 lacks in a lot of places, but what sequel doesn't (except for the magnificent Halloween H20)? It has some exciting scenes, so I'm satisfied, because I definitely didn't expect an Oscar winner!",Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers

Finally it gets into a good story, unfortunately it drags on towards the end...The most annoying thing too is that this film was followed by the sixth instalment, you would of thought after all this time Michael would give it a rest. I guess he really is pure evil...",Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers
184,jpasols,Michael Myers Lives and this time They're Ready?,9,11 May 2019,"Are they ready though? Because the end scene of Halloween 5 literally ALL the cops die! Michael Myers and the mysterious man in the cloak take out the ENTIRE police force. So I dont think they were THAT ready lol. But seriously, Halloween 5 takes place exactly one year after the events of Halloween 4 and Jamie Lloyd now 9 years old, is traumatized and also has some kind of strange telepathic bond with Michael Myers (since she touched him at the end of Halloween 4) now Jamie sees what Michael sees, feels what Michael feels, and Jamie is also on mute in this movie, she doesnt say a single word until the last 20-30 minutes of the film (until the curse or whatever it is wears off of Jamie which *hint hint* leads to next Halloween sequel). But back to Halloween 5, I personally think this is a good horror film, like Halloween 4 this movie has its intense and frightening moments. Such as the terrifying laundry shoot scene near the end of the film where Jamie gets trapped in the laundry shoot and Michael is stabbing his knife through the metal walls to try and get Jamie. That scene was SO claustrophobic and horrifying! Even scarier than the roof top scene in Halloween 4. So Halloween 5 earns major points for that scene! Another favorite scene of mine in this film that earns itself more points is the Tower Farm murders and the car chase through the corn field. Loved those scenes! Halloween 5 earns a lot of points just for having those two scenes.
Again, Halloween 5 has a scary and dark music score that once again sets the tone and atmosphere of the film. Definitely darker than the 4th film.
The new characters in this movie were okay, I'd say my favorite actress that was a new face in this movie was Tina, played by Wendy Kaplan. Tina was an engaging and fun and outgoing character to this movie and really brought some light to the film as well, since this installment has some very dark moments. It sucked to see Tina die in this movie because besides Rachel, Jamie and Dr. Loomis, I really didn't wanna see Tina die. But oh well, Tina died to save Jamie, so shes amazing for that.
Now again with the mask Michael wears for this movie, it's even worse than the mask he wore in Halloween 4. The Halloween 5 mask looks so crazy, not creepy or scary but weird. Not a good quality Michael Myers mask for this film, but it didn't kill the film because the mask was bad. I'd say what killed this film more than anything was throwing in the man in the black hat and cloak. I heard in a documentary that the director of Halloween 5 wanted to bring something new and fresh to the Halloween series so he randomly tosses in some weirdo dressed in a black hat and black cloak and has a strange thorn symbol on his wrist and is also connected to Michael Myers. Even the director claims he doesnt know who the mysterious man is. It was something random they threw in this movie to bring something new to the franchise but all it did was confuse the audience. Halloween 5 introducing us to the black hat man sets up the events for Halloween 6: The Curse of Michael Myers (which is also a VERY confusing film). So that's my BIGGEST issue with Halloween 5 and 6. Not a fan of ""Michael Myers being involved with a demon summoning cult"". Really killed two of the Halloween films but pulling that stunt of Michael being involved with a cult. Not a good idea at all. But Halloween 5 is still a good movie, just not necessarily a worthy sequel is all. But I'm a HUGE Michael Myers fan and have been since I was only 6 years old. So I still enjoyed this film and even the 6th film because I'm THAT big of a fan!. But really could have taken the franchise in a different direction rather than diving into supernatural origins and cults. Halloween 6 really made what Halloween 5 did worse. Halloween 6 didn't fix the issue this film made at all, Halloween 6 should have ignored the black hat man in this one but they continued it so Halloween 6 really isnt that much better of a film.Overall, Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers, isnt a bad Halloween movie, and not a bad movie in general. I would recommend this ONLY to the hardcore Michael Myers fans.My final rating for Halloween 5: 8 out of 10",Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers

Loomis' mind was on nothing but stopping Michael. He became obsessed. Everyone is right about most of the characters though. Most of them became quite annoying, but they had to fit the plot somehow. Quite an ending. I kinda laughed at the idea of putting Michael in jail. When they had him in jail i thought that that was the end and it would be an awful ending. Apparently it wasn't over and the evil mystery man in the movie broke him out. This movie is scary, but quite different at times. And that affected it and made it worse. A lot worse!

Right on cue, Michael awakens on Halloween, killing the man who took care of him and proceeds to go about his usual murderous rampage, hunting down his niece and anyone who gets in his way.Jamie's foster sister Rachel returns briefly but is subsequently killed off at the beginning of the movie leaving her eccentric best friend, Tina as the movie's main heroine and a bunch of other bland, underdeveloped teenagers for the audience to root for.Little Danielle Harris acts her socks off and as the scene in which Jamie hides from Michael inside a laundry chute proves, she holds her own as a preteen horror movie heroine.The movie also begins the introduction to the mysterious 'man in black' and contrary to popular opinion, I thought was an interesting addition to the series and could've taken it in a fresh direction, if executed properly - which it wasn't. The nonsensical parts of the movie are almost too many to mention.

This film is really for ""Halloween"" completest only, and is for the most part unwatchable. The storyline that ended ""Halloween 4"" isn't revisited (with no explanation), and goes in a really strange and awful direction that is continued in the EVEN WORSE film that follows. The whole ""man in black"" concept is ridiculous and silly, and actually isn't even explained until the next film. The acting is very bad, and Donald Pleasance seems like he is really slowing down and ill throughout the film. I actually felt sorry for him watching this. Do yourself a favor, and don't even waste your time renting this.",Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers
197,Dellamorte_Dellamore07,"""Everyone hated it at the time, but now with the crap infested duds like H20 and Resurrection, i look back with a grin""",6,14 July 2004,"Perhaps the darkest Halloween, this surpasses halloweens 3,6,7,8 and technically is really Halloween 4 of myers story.Most people all ready know the plot so I'll just give my two cents in. I dug the coolest credit montage ever to grace a Halloween movie (the pumpkin getting violently carved) and liked how Micheal escaped from the well, but why was the old mountain man so stupid? why did the parrot the old guy have stay in one position the whole year? what's with that one mysterious deleted scene all about? was he originally suppose to be some hick brat? The new elements that are added to the plot arn't that inventive or interesting, but I will admit to liking the Thorn tattoo on Micheals hand, when we first see it is kinda cool. Jamies psychic link is incohesive and doesn't add much to the plot, especially one infuritaing scene involved Jamie being mute, but all of sudden slowly starts to talk??? was she mute because of the trauma? the link? an excuse not to to talk to that loud mouth nurse? who knows. I liked othenin's approach to killing Halloween 4's scream queen RACHEL within the first twenty minutes, you never really knew if she was going to die or survive, he toyed with it, but her kill was so blah, come on RACHEL was a lot smarter then that.none the less, much like Alien 3(Newt and Hicks) her death makes the movie seem more dark and makes sense in a horror series. People stop complaining about this!!! The teens that replace her are soooo annoying and this (in all my opinion) is the films main fault. We spend at least 30 minutes of the movie having Micheal follow these morons from one house to the next, to the store, to the party, then to the barn where he slowly stalks and kills them. It took to long and the dialouge these kids speak (inparticular Sammy and Tina's dialouge walking from Rachel's house) is worse then mosquitos buzzing. Donald pleasance isn't given much to do her except act insane, but any pleasance is better then none. Harris annoyed me up until the myers house and there (the laundry chute, the attic)she definitely came across. such a sweetie, perfect choice of casting for JAIME!!...the man in black adds a lot of mystery and actually held my curiosity for six years waiting for the style over substance H6. and the ending had just as much impact as H4's and left me feeling confused but in a good way. So all in all, Halloween 5 kicks H20 and Resurrection's asses, stronger script(!) then H6, pretty much is the same as 4 (with flaws and characters), and is easily out beat by 1 and 2. Othenin's (dir)approach is kinda cool too, dark and slow paced, but takes time to add atmosphere (most likely his excuse to transform the myers house into a othic mansion),and the characters are soo bad you will have a little fun laughing at them, especially TINA,MIKE,and SPITZ...god, what were they thinking.** out of ****",Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers
198,claptonisgod53,The Series Begins To Become A Mess,3,24 September 2008,"I look at Halloween 5 as the first unacceptable film in the Halloween series. Halloween 3 could have been better, but Halloween 2 and 4 were amazing sequels with the first film being a horror classic. As anybody reading this knows, the Halloween series is about the harsh serial killer, Michael Myers (aka The BoogyMan). As the series ran on, the movies began to tell about Michael's past life, revealing that Laurie Strode is Michael's sister, and so on. Halloween 5 really moves into Michael's motivation as a killer, but this is where the series really began to fail.The whole creepy feeling about Michael Myers is the fact that he could be anybody, anywhere. As we seen in the first film, he came from a normal suburban family. He came from this to a serial killer with a very large body count on Haddonfeild Records. This is what made him mysterious, but Halloween 5 and 6 ruined this with a new side-plot which ruined the series all together.Halloween 5 introduces the idea that Michael Myers has come from a cult known as the Thorn. While this is more looked at in the next film, Halloween 6, Halloween 5 begins to introduce this. I think that this supernatural side of Michael is nothing but a pathetic attempt to cash in. It advances nothing in the storyline except more sequels in a franchise that is still carrying on to this day.Halloween 5 also suffers from being a poor film altogether. In Halloween 4, the film makers gave us a fairly likable cast as well as a talented cast. In Halloween 5, this is hardly the case. The cast of characters in Halloween 5 could very well be the most annoying in the entire series, which provides no tension in the decent kill scenes. I was hoping that some characters would get killed off earlier, because they literally took me out of the entire film. The script is also very poorly written.The only pros in this film are the performance given by Donald Pleasense and that atmosphere at times, but this didn't help the overall experience at all.Certain times throughout film history, it has been obvious when filmmakers make attempts to cash off of many, many films. Halloween 5 is one of those cases. Nothing but greed here.",Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers
199,votesmall,"Horrible movie, but better than Curse",3,9 October 2011,"Halloween 5 sucked. It was horrendous. But it had its moments, so it wasn't bad all the way through, and it wasn't like Howard the Duck, where it was almost painful to watch. No, this one kept me scared and somewhat interested. But for most of it I was shaking my head. But he is nowhere near as scary as he was when he entered the closet Laurie was hiding in in 1978's Halloween.I think that the plot is the chief reason as to why Halloween 5 is so terrible. It isn't the acting, or the scares. It starts after Michael is shot, what, like 400 times, and falls down a mine shaft. Although in the previous movie, little Jamie Lloyld (Danielle Harris) had apparently gone nuts and stabbed her stepmother to death with a pair of scissors, this is clearly ignored in Revenge, and Michael actually crawls out of the mine shaft alive as they dynamite it! So, he escapes and falls into another one of his trademark comas in the hut of some hermit, where he remains comatose for a year. Why the hermit didn't bother to go the authorities and report that he had some comatose guy in his place I'll never know. Besides, doesn't everybody in and around Haddonfield know about the infamous killer? Wouldn't it have made more sense to have some passing travelers come by, find the body, take him to their car, where they discover he had a bulletproof vest on that he stole from a cop he killed or something, and he kills them and steals their car, goes back to Haddonfield, and attempts to kill everyone again, with Jamie in Smith's Grove or something like that. Right? I don't know. Anyway, so Michael awakens exactly before Halloween exactly one year later and kills the hermit, returns to Haddonfield, where Jamie is now apparently telepathic and mute or something like that, and knows when her uncle is going to strike. Really? You had to bring telepathy into this? Well, it actually gets worse. He has some type of symbol on his hand and a mysterious figure in a black coat begins showing up everywhere. The ""man in black"" is actually a member of a cult dedicated to Michael, known as the cult of thorn!! But I can't help but feel that this is the one sequel that isn't the worst in the series, but the most absurd one that you can't help but wonder if they were actually serious about it. And fans say that the Myers house looks completely different. But seriously? That's what everybody is going after for this film? Out of all the things to criticize, that's what you are going to point out? Besides, you really get to see the inside of the Myers house, and I think that it is really neat and creepy. Michael is more gory than scary. The scene where he chases Jamie through the old house was truly horrifying. It made him look insane when he stalked and tried to stab her through the laundry chute. And Jamie was actually very clever in that scene and used a way that actually could have been done to get out. Jamie asks Michael to take off the mask and calls him uncle, and he does, which shows that he is a human. Especially in the end scene in the jail where he has his back turned and looks truly sad and ashamed, knowing that he will be incarcerated for the rest of his life. But they sent him back to Smith's Grove where he already escaped from and did so again. It has a million plot holes (like how did the man in black get dynamite and how did Dr. Loomis plant a net in the old Myers house). Overall, 5/10. But this is generous. If the film had scrapped the chase scene and the jail scene, we would be left with a typical, low budget teen slasher flick with bad acting, stereotypical characters, bad character development, random people who die and you never really cared about in the first place, jump scares, implausible Jason-like invincibility, and crappy music. Michael has become Jason Voorhees now, he cannot die, no matter what you frigging do to him, he just keeps on ticking!!!! They want money. But in doing so, the film lost money with each film, because fans stopped seeing them. Because they knew they would suck. No longer is Michael some psycho with complex motivations and a constant part of the shadows, now he just kills everyone and everything without really getting a feeling of dread with the ingenious score playing. No longer are the Halloween films a unique treat. They have now become high-budget movies that play like low budget ones. You know what? I honestly despise Moustapha Akkad for this. I honestly hate the man. He took a good franchise and ruined it. Ruined it for money. The simple idea that he had done the ending of Return like, he was dead and Jamie is now going to turn out like him. But no. That's not the route he took. When Return was in theaters, he started to think up the implausible 'here's how the killer survived' scene. Why did they do the ending like they did if they were just going to make him live? Why didn't they just do the original Halloween ending where Michael is gone? Something they did at the end of this movie. It is barely a film worth bothering over. Thankfully, there will be worse sequels to come, but this is still a fun film if you watch it with low expectations and play mst3k with it! :)",Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers
200,sjhollen,Frustrating film,4,16 June 2020,"This movie had the potential to be really good. It ignored part 4's cliffhanger ending, which would've been forgiven if they went in a good direction but instead it was just a standard horror flick with Jamie having psychic powers because, why not. Tina is a horrible character, it's especially saddening that we have to deal with her after having Rachel in part 4, who I thought was a great final girl. So needless to say, the plot is not good.Michael Myers looks horrible. Don Shanks could've been a good Myers, however they gave him a horrible mask that immediately ruins the character. However, one thing about this film is that it has the laundry chute scene which is probably one of the best scenes of the entire series.If you are a fan of the Halloween series, you should check it out and see if you like it. If you're not, you probably won't like it.",Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers
201,vince200002000,Just Doesn't Cut It,4,24 September 2007,"This movie was much more boring then it was exciting. First let me start by saying that the mask in this movie was absolutely horrifying (In a bad way). Most of the actors from part 4 have return which is one of the few redeeming qualities of the film. Michael has come back to Haddonfield to make another attempt at killing his niece Jamie. Whitch is pretty much the same plot as the prequel only this time around it is far more repetitive and boring. The other major reason why this movie was so poor was because of that sad excuse for what they called the Myers house. It looked nothing like the original house and it just didn't fit to the story. It looks more like an old warehouse then what was once someones home. The town didn't even look like Haddonfield. It looked like a town down south. This movie just doesn't fit in with the rest of the series or at least not very good, and it should have just been skipped.",Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers
202,maisyskinner,Has Some Good Moments,5,11 October 2021,"Michael Myers manages to escape the explosion from the end of part 4 after passing on a weird psychic link with his niece. He lives with hermit for a whole year until Halloween where he wakes up from his coma and heads back into town to kill off his niece and anyone else who gets in his way.While heavy on style, Halloween 5 has one of the oddest scripts in the entire franchise. Young Danielle Harris supports the entire film on her surprisingly sturdy shoulders and delivers a performance the film doesn't even deserve. You're with her every step of the way even as the film takes some very questionable detours and gives us a bunch of annoying teenage characters who we're ready to see killed the minute they arrive on screen.",Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers
203,reiss-ferlance,You can see where it is starting to flaw,5,6 May 2007,"Halloween 4 is an entertaining horror sequel to Halloween, I really enjoyed that one a lot. Halloween 5 however, is good but not great. The flaws start to show, the cracks in the wall seem to get bigger (hope you like my analogies) In H5 we start off with a reminder of how H4 ended, and we see what happens after Michael Myers gets shot. And of course, the old Mikey always survives. Halloween 5 will probably disappoint some fans of Halloween. But I thought the movie was OK. Halloween 5 does entertain, but not to the fullest extent. It has a few exciting thrills, and some new interesting characters, and it is explained. We find out a bit more about Michael Myers, we also see a different side of him that we have not scene before, and we see a mysterious stranger often. Halloween 5 is an OK movie, but not the best sequel in the series. Halloween III: Season of the Witch in my opinion is more entertaining than this movie.",Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers
204,horrorflicklover,Absolutely enjoyable,7,17 August 2008,"Everyone declared Halloween 4 to be the return to form that the franchise needed after Halloween 3 failed to hit. Personally, I thought Halloween 5 was a better film. It had more action, better pacing, and still lived up to it's franchise. The latter point was also done by H4 as well, but the film just wasn't as enjoyable to me. Halloween 5 may have been panned by many, And I get it. But frankly, I thought it was enjoyable.Halloween 4 and 5 go together well, just like the first two Halloween films did. They're actually meant to, if you watch the end of H4. Provided, you have to suspend disbelief to accept how Halloween 5 continues. However, it all falls within the realm of Michael Myers' character, so it's not as if you'll necessarily be smacking yourself in the head over it. However, it really could have been done better. The obvious solution would have been the best one.That aside, this movie is just FUN. That's what it does best. From start to finish, I wholeheartedly enjoyed it. It established a solid body count, without delving in to Jason Voorhees levels of absurdity. I didn't feel like it needed to drop itself on to a lower level. Michael Myers still maintains the ""class"" that he always had. But the film evolved to suit the time in which it was released.The ""ESP"" part of the film (which I have the feeling that a lot of fans didn't like) didn't bother me in the least. I thought it was an acceptable twist, as it didn't mutilate Michael Myers's persona. Myers has to evolve in order for the franchise to remain interesting. I found this to be an acceptable part of his evolution. The main thing that made him who he was remained intact. We're given a GLIMPSE of possibly humanization by the man, but that is gone just as soon as it appears. Happily re-affirming to fans of the series that despite these developments, he's still Michael Myers.Danielle Harris puts up another outstanding performance in this film, as she did Halloween 4. Donald Pleasance, as we know, is always gold. These two are the absolute standouts, and I think they really save the film where it could have otherwise collapsed.The movie definitely has its flaws. Oh boy, it does. The bumbling idiot cop duo (who despite their best efforts to lampshade how badly they suck) certainly toss in some terrible camp, and threaten disbelief. Seriously, they were Keystone Kops level, and they hurt the film. And then the scene with the cop's death over the hand-held radio. ""Come in Charlie"". Give me a break. It's obvious he's being murdered *groans* And that is an example of certain points of flimsy writing that this movie did have. I liked the action, I liked the story. But crap, it does have some of those lousy slasher flick tropes that were rightfully ridiculed in later films like Scream.Another problem with Halloween 5 is the ""Man in Black"" subplot. For one, it's barely there throughout the entire film, only to drop in towards the end as an excuse to set Michael free. It was a sub-plot that I could have done without, that set up for a sequel that I DEFINITELY could have done without (Halloween 6 really sucked).Overall, I thought this was a damn fun movie. It has it's bad points, sure. But to me, the rest of the film was so enjoyable that I didn't dwell on them too much. Give it a shot.",Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers
205,ericritter-01765,Hope You Brought A Book,5,23 April 2020,"Halloween 5 is the completely unnecessary sequel to the surprisingly solid Halloween 4 which, despite not having the atmospheric scope photography for the first three films in the franchise, did take the series into a somewhat interesting and suspenseful direction. In that film, Michael escapes during a transfer to another hospital and returns to Haddonfield to try and kill his niece, Jamie. Jamie survives, but it seems that she's inherited her uncle's blood thirst after she stabs her adoptive mother with a pair of scissors.This shock ending seemed like a great new place to go for a sequel, but Halloween 5 all but abandons this and goes for a more generic slasher route. Jamie still has some sort of psychic link with her homicidal uncle and can tell where and who he'll kill next, but she no longer has a desire to kill anyone herself. She's been rendered mute and it takes her half the film to finally speak. Danielle Harris is excellent in the role and turns in another insanely brilliant child performance as Jamie, but Ellie Cornell is wasted as Rachel and disappears from the film rather suddenly leaving us with a bunch of shrill teen characters for Michael to rip through with reckless abandon.Halloween 5 is a nicely shot film and there are moments of atmosphere here and there, but the plotting is too silly to take seriously.",Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers
206,jvontheprowl,Five stars for being the stinker of the series.,5,27 April 2021,The director should be ashamed of how they treated treated the series. It loosely covers the end of 4. Being that Michael Myers was hit by a car and shot.In 4 it was a sinkhole and there wasn't a raging river feet behind it and it was a forest. In 5 it was a mine shaft and a raging river was somehow just behind it for some reason. In 4 Jamie went Coocoo banana nuts at the end and killed her stepmum. 5 her mum is okay.That much drift in the story is insulting. Especially being that 5 was released a year after 4.You also have the goofy circus cop theme which completely destroys the seriousness and feel of the movie. How can we take the menacing Meyers serious when there's two Italian clown cops bumbling around?Most the deaths are meaningless and not at all memorable. The only memorable character was Donald Pleasance and he was not at all relatable. The only relatable character is killed off near the beginning in the most pointless death of all of them.This is all on the director's bloody hands. It's shameful and an insult. Even 3 is watchable and entertaining if you hide that it is a Halloween movie.The interactions between Jamie and Dr. Loomis are the best part of the movie and worth watching.All-in-all this is watchable. It is a Halloween movie so you can't go wrong with some entertainment. Just know it's the blasphemous part of the series.,Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers
207,baileygiannini,After surviving the mine shaft explosion in the fourth film Michael Myers returns for his niece Jamie Loyd.,5,20 August 2013,Having said before that Halloween 4 was a success and worked for me this one I was on the fence with. Halloween 5 was a film that I experienced awhile back. But I still remember it of course. I feel this one wasn't as accurate in its performance than the fourth film. The reason being is that this is when the gore came in. And ever since this film in the Halloween franchise there's always been blood and guts. And it gets worse as the franchise and the movies goes on. Danielle Harris does a great job of playing Jamie. But the one thing that I didn't like (SPOILER ALERT) was that they killed off Rachel played by Ellie Cornell. She should've been in the movie longer. As for the effects. Good. I felt that this film is a lot more darker and grittier also gorier than the other four films that came before it. But overall even though it's 5 stars it's worth seeing.,Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers
208,MrTaft,Has it's moments...,8,4 December 2002,"While on the whole a poorly-made film that does little to help the ""Halloween"" series, this installment definitely delivers in regards to action and suspense. Most notably is the finale scene that takes place in the Myers house, with Michael and Jamie working well together to create a tense game of cat-and-mouse. Of course, the film could not have been made without the brilliance of main star Donald Pleasence - his fourth outing as Dr. Loomis is still on par with the original.The continual focus on the most annoying Tina and her teeny-bopper friends drags the film through the mud more often than not. Most of the characters are annoying, one-dimensional idiots who deserve to get the chop (particularly the boyfriends and those two ""clown"" cops). The ending was a surprise and worked quite well, and a special mention goes to Beau Starr for another excellent performance as Sheriff Ben Meeker. All in all, an average effort but nothing to get excited about.",Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers
209,jason06-1,The Best In the Series,10,13 February 2007,"Halloween 5 is truly a underrated gem in the Halloween series. I consider it the best entry since the first one. The Good Things * Something that has been missing from the series is character development, we get to know every character before they are slashed and we are saddened to see them go. I almost always weep when Michael kills Rachel, as other people have stated she was the heart and soul of the fourth and her death leaves us with an empty hole in our hearts. Another character I felt sad for is Tina, she gave up her life to save Jamie's and that alone deserves a pat on the back. The scene following with Tina being carried away on a stretcher combined with the music and Jamie's reaction makes me want to weep.* The acting for a slasher movies rises the bar. Giving a standout performance is a big round for Danielle Harris! Harris is the shining light in the cast and she is such a tremendous actress. She plays Jamie to perfection and makes you care for her character to the hilt. Donald Pleasence gives he's performance all he's got and it shows. I rooted for him to kill Michael, but you can't keep a good killer down! Rounding out the cast Ellie Cornell and Wendy Kaplan who perform to the best of their ability.* A big plus is the film is never boring and has some great action sequences. Who can forget the chase with the car and the laundry chute sequence? Another thing this movie has is the ability to scare the viewer. I haven't jumped this many times since the first Halloween. * Although most people trash the new mask that Michael wears, I think it's the creepiest mask he's ever worn. The director got Don Shanks to play Michael and he plays Michael with a creep, unnerving style that makes you fear him.* This thing has to commented on. I loved the way how Michael was treated like a real person and that added to the effect of the film.Final Say: If you see this, grab it, buy it, go home and pop it in your DVD player and sit back and enjoy the masterpiece that is Halloween 5",Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers

212,PhillipMichaelH,"Despite its flaws, a unique a fun entry in the series.",8,28 May 2011,"This is the movie in the series that people hate the most, mostly critics and fans of the series. Sure, it does have its noticeable flaws and cringe worthy moments. The film suffers from a rough script and was rushed into production before the script could be perfected, it was released into theaters only a year after part 4 came out. While I can understand this argument, I would argue that almost all of the Friday The 13th films were rushed into production and were also released a year after their predecessors and were far worse then what this movie did. Most people point out this movie's faceless characters but again, I would argue that Friday The 13th has done a lot worse when it comes to character development and yet, these films are not criticized for the same reason.While this isn't a great movie and no where close to the original John Carpenter film, I still feel that it includes some of the most epic scenes in the entire series, more so then the highly praised Halloween 4. The final 30 minutes are thrilling and the ending leaves you wanting more because you're not sure what's going to happen next. I also think that this film added new story elements that were interesting. This film is also much darker and even Gothic I think.

213,doneil4,Where do I begin?,1,23 September 2019,"Many fans of the Halloween franchise will most likely point towards either Resurrection or the Rob Zombie remakes for being downfalls of the franchise. But I have to strongly disagree. Halloween 5 for me was the ultimate failure. The director of this installment admitted himself he didn't care about the film and that it was going to be ""the next director's problem"". Or something to that affect.This film doesn't even try, just look at the Mask in this movie, it's nothing like the Halloween 4 mask (which wasn't a great mask either but still..) is it a terrifying mask? Terrifyingly garbage. And since when did the Myers house become an abandoned mansion?! Ok I get it was filmed in a different location most likely than where the first Halloween film was made but still... the Myers house was always a simple looking house that's been abandoned. And why oh why did they decide to have Michael Myers cry??!! And that's not all of it, believe me.For those of you who have never seen any, or not all of the Halloween movies... if ever you decide to have a Halloween marathon then please, for your own sake, skip Halloween 5. You'll not get those 98 minutes back. And quite honestly you're not missing anything that you need to know for Halloween 6, accept maybe the introduction to the Man in Black, which again.. just why?It's sad really, because Halloween 4 is actually one of the better sequels and it was followed on by this rubbish.Are there any good things about this movie? Actually, yes. Despite the terrible film, Donald Pleasence and Danielle Harris still give good performances. I can say that much.

214,TheCrowing13,Such a let down...,5,4 January 2009,"I was so impressed with the ""Halloween"" series before this movie. (Excluding three) They had kept up being great horror films unlike it's peers. The first thing that gets me from the beginning is why the hell would someone keep Michael's body in their cabin for an entire year, until next Halloween. He should have awakened right when he was found and Halloween 5 should have stuck to the style of Halloween 2 tieing in to a direct sequel to the film. Not waiting a year sitting in someones cabin. The characters that made #4 great are killed off, Rachel is one, but the character that takes her place is a little too real. Tina is the new guardian figure of Jamie, and is just as real feeling as Rachel, but to an annoying point. This is made sure you understand what kind of person she is by the moment she is introduced. Danielle Harris's performance in the previous film was surprisingly good. Being a child actress, I don't blame her for her ridiculous performance in #5. I blame whoever was telling her what to do. Half the film her role is silent, which will be explained why later. She still has her moments in the film. Now the film isn't all bad, like 4's rooftop chase scene 5 has the laundry pit scene. It's the same formula as the rooftop chase scene and has the same edge of your seat effect. This chapter of the ""Halloween"" franchise, really brings in the supernatural element to Michael. Has he has a psychic relationship with his niece Jamie,(hence the end of #4) and since he appears to be mute, Jamie is too. I suppose this film could be watch by mainstream audiences but I only recommend for fans of the genre of are looking to get into it. 5/10",Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers

'He' killed a large number of locals just to get to his niece, Jamie Lloyd, played by the underrated Danielle Harris. However his doctor, Dr.Loomis, of all people, along with the help of the cops, put an end to the horror by shooting him 'till he was out of sight. But this was only the beginning as Jamie attacked her stepmother as soon as she settled home.Now, it is Halloween night & 'he' has returned to Haddonfield killing randoms in order to murder hid niece. Yet every time he kills, Jamie can sense it which can help Dr Loomis, played by the late Donald Pleasence, to track Myers down.Halloween 5 had potential to spin a twist on the then tired series but the takes the usual, routine direction...what a shame.The plot is weak & tired & old. What's worse is that the movie plays out in the usual routine. What a bummer! So we get a weak storyline, weak direction, weak score, weak script, undeveloped characters...weak movie.Also, the film is heavily clichéd & really predictable. This film isn't even suspenseful, scary, creepy, spooky, eerie, tense, intense or any other adjective that should describe a horror film. Thankfully, i was not expecting much. This picture is pretty much a washed up retread of Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myres (1988) all over again. Pointless, really. Despite all the above, Halloween 5 was quite entertaining & did a few nice touches. 1st, The Man in Black is introduced in the movie. Good idea. But still, it lead to the stupid ""thorn"" subplot... Well there's always the fact that the acting, while not better than the previous installment, is OK. Though Danielle Harris's acting was really good. Ditto Donald Pleasence. Another touch, the atmosphere...wait not the atmosphere (that sucked). The fact that this sequel makes nice attempts to be like or capture the feeling of the original Halloween (1978). You can tell. Michael stalks the girls while they have girl talk, he watches them & when you think he is gonna strike he doesn't. AND remember from number 1 in which the girlfriend thinks Myres is her boyfriend when it's actually Myres dressed up in a costume. Well, that happens in this slasher too, encept it's a bit fractured. Some other things too resemble but i can't remember. All i all i, liked the original Halloween's inspiration towards this flick..yet the original was effective.Really, this flick is kinda like Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myres (1988) with the style of Halloween (1978). Cool style not played out well enough, though.I almost forgot the gore! This flick has OK gore in it. We get some stabs, some stabs with other sharp weapons. We get blood. But the movie has a slow pace so much of it is tame. Hey, at least it is gorier & more violent than Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myres (1988). Violence abound. But the death scenes don't stand out much encept for the 2nd one. TAME.I can't recommend it... but if you don't care, go watch it...that is, if you can find it.2 out 5 stars.Followed by the bad sequel, Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myres (1994).",Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers

217,Porkchop_Express,Entertaining sequel,8,13 July 2002,"'Halloween pt. 5' takes place right after part 4, just like the original 'Halloween' films. None of the sequels will ever measure up to the brilliant original, but part 5 isn't too bad. It's one year after part 4, when Michael Myers is blasted into a mine shaft.He manages to pull himself out, & gets nursed back to health by a hermit. Soon he finds himself back to Haddonfield, after his niece Jaime & whoever else gets in his way. Jaime is staying at Haddonfield Children's Clinic, after her 'breakdown'. Since part 4, she is somehow linked mentally with Michael, & can sense who is in danger & where. It's as she looks thru his eyes. Also, you get a glimpse of the mysterious Man In Black, who is brought back in a larger role in 'Halloween 6'. Both characters have a thorn tattoo on their wrists, & are apparently linked somehow. Some of the characters return from part 4, which is reminisent from the first two films, & of course screen icon Donald Pleasence returns as Dr. Sam Loomis, who once again is on Michael's track. This time, Dr. Loomis seems just as psychotic as Michael. It's not a bad movie at all. Watch it with part 4 back-to-back.",Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers

It's my 2nd favorite of the Halloween movies right next to the Rob Zombie remake. There are some things about it I don't like. For example: How come the police officers let Michael Myers keep his mask on when they took him to prison? Why did Michael goes berserk when Jamie touched his face? If that other Mike character took good care of his car where are the brake lights? And how can Jamie have a telepathic connection with Michael? It happened in the flashback of the 4th movie when Jamie held Michael's hand before he got back up. But still how does that work? At least it's explained. But overall I don't mind it that much.

After that he wakes up and again targets his niece.This was not what I was expecting after seeing Halloween 4. This one ignores the ending of H4 and goes straight to Micheal Myres surviving the explosion. That was one of the things that disappointed me. What I think they should have done was to leave out Micheal Myres maybe until the end and make Jamie the killer.The acting was OK but it could have been better. Donald Pleasants is still good as the tormented psychiatrist Dr Loomis but not as good as he was in the previous films. He is now a very tired doctor and now just talks non-stop. Danelle Harris reprises her cute role as Jamie Lloyd.The killings are the worst part. They have been used before and some are not bloody enough. In fact the whole film is like just another excuse to see more murders that have been seen in other Halloween films or other horror icons like Jason Voorhees (not a big fan of his).The whole plot is slow and nothing different than H4. Micheal is still after his niece, Loomis is trying to stop him. Overall this a very weak sequel to the series that is like watching a H4 remake.",Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers

225,jjpurwitsky,The Halloween Saga: Halloween 5,6,13 July 2012,"Halloween 4 was released in theatres and spent two weeks in the number one spot at the box office. Michael Myers was back and dominating the box office. Halloween had returned, and like it's many imitators it officially entered the realm of the slasher film serial drama.At the end of part four, Michael was dead and his niece, in a twist ending, had taken his place as 'pure evil'. The series was poised to move into new places and new realms of terror. 1989 came and saw the release of more Nightmare on Elm Street's and Friday the 13th's, but as Halloween had returned to its roots and Michael Myers joined the echelon of horror movie icons, things began to change.Audiences, it seemed, were growing somewhat tired of the slasher genre. The idea of seeing the same story play out again and again, with very little, if any, originality was starting to get old. The fifth Nightmare and the eighth Friday, just didn't play as well as the movies the ones before. Audiences, it seemed, were ready for something new. And Halloween 5 was poised to do just that.Almost exactly one year after Halloween 4 was released, Halloween 5 debuted in theaters. The film opens up with the death of Michael Myers in part four, only this time you see he doesn't actually die. And although things had seemed like they would be different, within the first five minutes, it becomes clear that Halloween 5 is just going to deliver more of the same. After the abysmal fourth entry in the series, and the poor (er) performances at the box office for Halloween's rivals, more of the same might not of been a good idea.But surprisingly, Halloween 5 delivers more thrills and chills and entertainment than it's predecessor and makes for a rather enjoyable hour and forty minutes. Halloween 4, unlike the original and first sequel, seemed more like Friday the 13th (without the gore) than a Halloween movie. Halloween 5, on the other hand, feels like a true Halloween movie (with Friday the 13th gore).In the first Halloween, Michael lurked in the backgrounds and shadows, hiding and watching and waiting for the right time to strike. This is what made Michael Myers scary. Part four ignored this aspect and had Michael up front, in the foreground, barely in shadows and thus much less terrifying. Part five brings back the shadows and the darkness; the lurking and the followin. As well, unlike the fourth film, the man behind the mask, the man who played Michael Myers, actually felt imposing, and large and frightening. Not since the first film did Michael Myers feel and act so right.Other than the man behind the mask, the whole surviving cast of part four returns here, and again, unlike the fourth film, the acting isn't half bad. Donald Pleasance is his usual great self as Dr. Loomis and Danielle Harris brings out a stronger and more well rounded performance as Jamie then she did a year previous. She carries the picture and is a joy to watch. Not all of the acting is as good as hers but it is a sure improvement over the last entry. The main reason for this, it seems, is the director.Helmed by Frenchman, Dominique Othenin-Girard, Halloween 5 is a rather well directed slasher flick. It has moody atmosphere, some great (not as good as Dean Cundey's glorious work in the first three films) cinematography and lighting, and decent editing. It has a cohesive, if not great, story and it flows well from the opening moments until the closing moments of the film.The story has Michael once again chasing after Jamie, but thrown into the mix is a psychic connection between the two of them and a mysterious 'man in black' who keeps popping up in unexpected times and places. Who is this 'man in black' and what is he up to? The answer, it seems, will be told in the next film or films in the series.There are many weak spots in the story though, like the inclusion of Rachel (Jamie's 'sister' from part four) 's friend, who for no reason is incredibly attached to Jamie and vice versa. Or that many incidents from the fourth film are forgotten, ignored or disregarded to make this film work. Probably the biggest and most frustrating inconsistency is the Myers house. The first two movies made Michael's house legendary and in this film the house makes another appearance, only the viewer at first doesn't know it. It looks different in shape, colour and design, and since not much exposition is given, it is kind of confusing as to where people are when they first get there.But Halloween 5 does have some good gory deaths. It has nudity and sex. It has Michael Myers acting like Michael Myers. It has great atmosphere and creative and interesting camera work. It has decent acting and scary moments. It has unexpected deaths and an unexpected ending. It has all the right touches to make Halloween 5 a worthy sequel in the Halloween saga and a worthy entry in the sky high pile of slasher films. Even though it didn't deliver on the promise of something new that part four left the audience with, it still did what part four didn't and couldn't do. It brought Michael Myers back home.Film Rating: 63%Breakdown (How Halloween 5 scored 63%):Production Design: 7 out of 10 Cinematography: 7 out of 10 Re-playability: 6 out of 10 Originality: 5 out of 10 Costumes: 5 out of 10 Directing: 7 out of 10 Editing: 7 out of 10 Acting: 7 out of 10 Music: 7 out of 10 Script: 5 out of 10Read my other reviews at www.fullmetalreviews.blogspot.com",Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers
226,LanderRei,"A decent sequel, but far from great",8,7 October 2002,"Halloween 5 is my third favorite in the series (Kinda-sorta tied with the recent Halloween: Resurrection)and while its nowhere near as great as part 4 or the original, its not as poor as H20 or 6.The acting was good in some parts, bad in others. Danielle Harris, as always, did a wonderful job, and is probably the best aspect of the film. Ellie Cornell has a much smaller role in the movie, than she did in part 4, but she still does quite well in her few scenes. And of course, Donald Pleasence was excellent, but at this point Dr. Loomis' rants are gettin' kinda old. Oh yeah...and I cant tell whether it was her character or just her, but Wendy Kaplan was amazingly annoying.Theres no storyline in this film, beyond ""Myers is back, and he's still killin' people."" But thats alright, because who really would be expecting a thought-provoking storyline from a movie called ""Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers)At least the movie has some good kills in it. Any death involving a scythe is cool. Although it still seems pretty tame compared to most other slasher flicks. Also, its not scary at all. Myers drives in a car a couple of that times, and I think that was supposed to be tense, but it wasnt, and I ended up muting it because Wendy Kaplan wouldn't stop screaming. Ugh.Lastly, although this isnt too bad, the Tagline is a lie. ""Michael Lives, And This Time They're Ready!""  Ahem. Maybe Jamie Lloyd and Dr. Loomis are ready, but everybody else is as unprepared as they come. At the very end, they finally seem ready. They even call in the Haddonfield SWAT team or something. But the entire team is outsmarted by Myers, and they end up leaving one stinkin' cop to watch over the little girl. Yes, they are so ready...Myers is going down! *Cough..cough*Although I will admit, the end of the movie is pretty good.

Setting is the same as first, in a town that I forget the name of, and everyone fears Michael Myers. I respect the heart touching scene in this movie between Michael and niece. If you love Halloween like me, you cant resist it. It tells you the fifth part of the story. Cliffhangers are cool, thats a respectable thing about Halloween 5 for the Cliff Hanger at the end.

228,Hotstar,Disappointing.,4,20 December 2004,"Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers was alike Halloween II a great sequel and thoroughly justified the questionable decision to bring Myers back.The shock ending to Part 4 also left fans demanding another sequel ASAP. I bet they wished they hadn't bothered.Halloween 5 is so obviously rushed and is littered with plot holes and events that make no sense whatsoever.Jamie's madness is almost discarded as a plot line, the man in black subplot makes little sense and makes even less in Part 6. Also Ellie Cornell's likable Rachel Carruthers character is killed off almost instantly, and instead the film is carried by a bunch of colourless, obnoxious and unbelievably formulaic characters.The result of this is that the viewer begins to root for Myers, willing him to slice and dice these dull protagonists. The two cops amused me, but the circus SFX did not. The only thing that lifts this picture barely above standard horror, is the performance of Donald Pleasence, his Loomis character really begins to lose the plot in this one.Unquestionably the weakest Michael Myers flick, although Part 6, and Resurrection are only mildly better. This is where the wheels began to fall away in the Halloween saga, even H20 is frustrating, as it discards parts 4-6 as ever happening. Let's hope Part 9 is an improvement and a return to form for the franchise although I wouldn't hold my breath.",Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers

Compare this to Friday the 13th part five and a Nightmare On Elm Street part five---see the differences?  The film is overall scary, just like its predecessors. Jamie is practically mute for the first half.  These ideas kind of sop the movie a bit.  But there is some scary scenes.For instance, when Jamie is trapped in the laundry chute.  I bet there is no one out there who has seen this movie that wasn't deeply terrified by that scene.  It had an appropriate body count and the film is all the more interesting with the mysterious guy in black prowling around.  I would rate this a 6/10.",Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers

So inevitably I will find an excuse to say all the films in the series are great in some way. Although there still has to be a worst, and this for me, is it.The ending to the 4th was obviously not the ending which was supposed to finish the series so this one was well expected. It carries on straight after the 4th and we see how Michael Myers is nursed back to health by a lonely farmer.........only to kill the poor bloke! The action, now a year later shows as he emerges to kill young Jamie again. What follows is another cat and mouse chase yet this one is different from the rest. The camera's look different and it doesn't look the same creepy Haddenfield.The worst part about this film is it tries to be comic! This may well work in Scream but is completely wrong here. The clown music after the Rachel scene, and the dumb cops completely ruined it. The story is rather poor and unoriginal and the ending is very confusing indeed. The 6th kind of explains it but still makes it hard to believe!

Dr. Loomis and Jamie are both pretty well acted, but everyone else sucks chunks. The one scene I did like (even though it doesn't work well for the character) is the rather touching moment when we see Michael's face, and he sheds a tear. I think of it as Michael being possessed by something that forces him to do the things he does, and he wants to break out. It's stupid, yeah, but so is this movie.

234,Theshapeo31,More underrated than Halloween 3,9,11 August 2012,"Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers ranks up there with the best of the series (in my opinion), more underrated than Halloween 3 but because I say that does it mean I'm crazy? Well maybe I am I tend to like a lot of movies people hate. But anyway this movie picks up a year after the events of the previous installment showing that at the end of Halloween 4 after being shot numerous times by the police force Michael Myers (George P. Wilbur in 4, Don Shanks in 5) didn't die and when they threw the dynamite in after him he crawl out of the mine shaft before it exploded and floated down a river. Also Jamie (Danielle Harris) didn't kill her foster mother while she was under Michael's possession and is somehow rendered mute (I never understood how but I guess she was traumatized by the experience). I guess I am crazy for liking this movie because I liked the character of Tina, the two bumbling Bobby's & this whole movie overall. Despite how much I enjoy this movie I only have 3 real complaints: 1.) Michael's mask. It looked horrible you don't know of someone sat on it while it was under the couch cushion or if it's meant to be an aliens face rather than William Shatner's. 2.) The character of Rachel (Ellie Cornell) a REALLY likable character whom you learn to care about in Halloween 4 dies in the first 15 minutes. 3.) Tina's death. I didn't like her death because despite that I liked her I'd rather see Rachel be the one to sacrifice herself to Jamie.Those were my cons and I get to my pros. The reasons why I like this installment is because in a few ways it reminds me of the first two Halloweens that are obviously the best. It reminds me of the original Halloween because Michael is portrayed more as ""The Shape"" as John Carpenter called him, he's the predator he was in the original, he stalked his prey, he waited and watch for the right moment to strike. It reminded me of the original Halloween II because when you think about it in the original Michael was shot 6 times off a balcony, in Halloween 4 he was shot numerous times into a mine shaft, here you get the notion that he's angry like in 2, you get more gore in the original and Halloween 4 you didn't see much gore at all but you saw more in II & 5. But I'm probably being nice to it because this was one of the first Halloween movie I saw I'm still trying to remember whether I saw this or H20 first. But either I love this movie, I enjoy watching it every year on AMC Fearfest and I'd rate this 4.5 Out of 5 Stars.",Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers
235,chrisbarker187,A decent Halloween film.,3,24 October 2014,"Halloween 4 was a huge success, no doubt. They knew it would be hard to beat that but no one expected Halloween 5 to be this bad. Now I say it's bad, but I still enjoy it thoroughly. Halloween 5 was made and actually takes place exactly one year after Halloween 4. Jamie is now mute (which is never really explained to a full extent why) and of course Michael survives by climbing through a mine shaft and escaping down a river/dam. One thing leads to another and Michael finds his way to Rachel, Jamie's sister who gets killed withing the first 10/15 minutes. We find out about a suspicious man in black who is roaming around Haddonfield every now and again. More bodies start to pile up to the point where we found out that Jamie has some kind of psychological bond with Michael by knowing when people are in danger. The film then builds up to Michael chasing Jamie around his old house where Dr. Loomis has a trap set up. Michael gets caught in the trap and is then taken to the police station where he will spend the rest of his life in prison. That is of course until the suspicious man in black starts shooting up the station helping Michael escape. All in all, Halloween 5 is a not bad film. Could have been a lot better, but it also could have been a lot worse. I would give it a 7 out of 10, because it is enjoyable but not as strong as the first 3 (excluding Halloween 3).",Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers

I know that the mask in H4 was trashed during filming but this mask looks like it was made in a kindergarten class.if you were thinking of watching this movie don't. if you think this movie good, then hit yourself real hard cause it sucks. it barely earned that one.EDIT: after seeing the movie bloodrayne I decided this movie is worth watching if you like being creeped out near halloween. so I now give this film a 4.",Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers
237,jerbear-13266,Why Won't He Die?,5,2 August 2019,"For a 5th entry in a slasher series, Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers is about as braindead and uneventful as one would think. It picks up a year after little Jamie (a terrific Danielle Harris in an almost totally silent performance for a majority of the film) stabbed her stepmother with a pair of scissors after, seemingly, inheriting Michael Myers' evil after touching his hand. Meanwhile, Michael survived the explosion by leaping into a stream and carrying himself off to the cabin of a hermit who's been nursing him back to health. October rolls around and he comes out of his coma and resumes his quest for teenage blood, but this time, Jamie has a psychic link with her uncle.There's also a strange man in black who keeps showing up for no reason in between teenage slaughter scenes.Halloween 5 doesn't start off that bad. It still keeps Jamie as a potential inheritor of Michael's evil, but as the film progresses, she goes back to being the normal little girl who's just trying to outrun her evil uncle that she was in the previous film. This entire storyline is discarded, but we do keep two bumbling cops who the film has decided to give a goofy theme song to. It's pretty jarring and takes one out of the film every time.There's at least a bit of suspense and tension generated at the climactic Tower Barn party where Michael carves up a few horny teenagers.",Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers
238,BigCombo,Actually I think this is the best Halloween sequel,6,29 August 1999,"First off, I hated Halloween H20. Kevin Williamson, you're rich, you're famous, now retire. Or just write TV. And Steve Miner - you can't direct.Halloween 2 is not bad. Not great.I'm not counting Halloween 3 in this discussion since that's the Season of the Witch and good old Miguel ain't in that one.Right, so we have Halloween 4, which has the best ending since Halloween 1. You have to love Jamie going all like Uncle Mike killing her stepmother. That was an amazing ending. Amazing. Creepy as hell.And then you have Halloween 5. Which has an absolutely hideous opening (that hermit who Michael shacks up with then kills? What?), but once it gets rolling it gets pretty fun. The Man in Black is confusing as hell but he adds a nice air of mystery to Michael (which almost excuses the fact that Michael, before this, has been: shot a few times by Loomis in Part 1, blown up by Loomis in Part 2, and shot to pieces and thrown down in a mineshaft in Part 4, and yet he lives...I mean, it doesn't take a 1600 SAT score to figure out that Michael's not quite human...). I think the Man in Black at this point suggests supernatural forces behind Michael (and Part 6 has all that horrible Cult stuff that squandered the opportunity to make this nice and creepy).Anyway, back to why I like Part 5. It scares the living hell out of me. Part 4 has its moments (you have to love the thumb in the forehead and the aforementioned Jamie-Goes-Berserk at the end), but it meanders a bit too much and too much of it takes place in daylight. Part 5 is actually directed fairly well and while yes, it has a lot of the ""BOO!"" oh that's not the killer HERE'S THE KILLER, it gets past it on the strength of Danielle Harris freaking out like a banshee (she scares the hell out of me) and the use of shadows, low angles, etc.Okay, just one more note.

239,KristofferAG,Probably the worst in the series.,3,16 October 2014,"You know the whole ""so bad it's good"" thing? Halloween 5 isn't that. It's just a bad movie. If we're not counting Halloween 3, which at least on some level works if you consider it a standalone movie, Halloween 5 was the worst of the series at the time, and the furthest we have been from the original. Michael Myers has gone from the clean simple kills of the first movie, to slicing people up with scythes and stabbing teenagers with pitchforks.Like with Halloween 2, this movie picks up right where it's prequel ended, with Myers falling down a well, that they subsequently blow up. Of course, he survives. Jamie is put in a children's hospital, and finds a friend in Billy, a boy her same age. Rachel is still around, as is Loomis and one of the cops from Halloween IV, but everyone else is gone. There's a new pair of friends to be slaughtered, some of which you're supposed to want dead. Loomis has finally gone completely insane, and I really did enjoy Pleasance's portrayal of the character, from beginning to end... if only this was the end.With regards to the cinematics of the movie, the long straight cuts are for the most part gone, though there are still some of those slow-moving shots where you'll see Myers' shadow or mask in the background, though I can't say I got the chills from any of them. The effects range from OK to down-right dumb, some of those gunshots look more like someone using a tinderbox than anything else, and I had some serious issues with how poorly some scenes were dubbed. The substantial cut in budget is very obvious. Why they decided to spend some of it on making a new mask for Don Shanks to wear.The plot is confusing, and has one of the weirdest endings you couldn't imagine. It's an obvious setup for a sequel that was put on ice for years because of the horrible reception this movie got. Jamie's somehow got some sort of a mental bond with Myers, and she's gone mute. Every time Myers kills, or is about to kill, she has a seizure of sorts where she sees what is happening. Loomis, who's completely obsessed by Myers at this point, is constantly pestering and pushing her for information, which she (at first) is unable or unwilling to share. I have no clue why they decided to have Rachel be the first kill, while trying to make us care about a couple of teenagers that we just met, before Myers gets around to killing them.You don't really care about any characters besides Jamie and Loomis. I mean, you might hate some of the new characters, like the kid who puts on a copy of Michael's mask, you know, like they already did in a Halloween movie. I'd like to believe that no kid would ever be stupid enough to do that, knowing Myers' history and that the police would be on edge about it. I'd like to believe. Anyway, Michael seems to be targeting Jamie, and anyone she loves, and it honestly seems like he's really thinking it through, killing Tina's boyfriend to get close to Tina, and later going after the Children's Hospital to get the cops away from the Myers House, where he knows Loomis and Jamie are waiting for him. It all seems very well planned, compared to the much more random killings he's done in the past.The most mind-numbing twist comes at the end. Throughout the movie you get shots of a man dressed in all black, coat included, and some iron-tipped cowboy boots. At the end, after Myers' capture, the same man shoots up a police station and breaks him out. Out of absolutely nowhere. For no reason.The good thing about Halloween 3 was that you could judge it as an independent horror movie. You can't do that with this one. It's a Halloween movie. A terrible Halloween movie that really should have been the end to the series.",Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers
240,5StarFonzie,Fresh Sequel,7,17 July 2002,"I read all your user comments on this film and just last night decided to watch it again but in all honesty, I really liked this film.  It is such a fresh sequel.
I like how Jamie and Michael has this telepathical bond between them, I think that made the film new.
I like how the thorn came into this movie and the man in black walking around everytime there's something going down.  I love that, that is so psychotic.  A serial killer cursed and a madmen who found a way to benefit from it.  Great stuff!  Like let's face it, it's a horror movie, don't expect oscar award winning stuff here you bunch of morons.  I think so far from the original until 5 is good stuff.
I also love when Michael showed sympathy a couple of times listening to Dr. Loomis talk to him about "" stopping the rage inside "" before he threw him off the platform and when he shed a tear when he took his mask off when Jamie asked him too.  That is sweet!  It shows that something is truly controlling him but he still has a human side.
*SPOILERS* Some of the scenes were done really cool too.  I like the scene where Jamie is up with Billy for the costume contest and Tina gets in the car with Michael not knowing it's really Michael Myers and as Michael peels off Jamie starts screaming.  As well as when Jamie is telling Loomis where Tina is and as they're talking about it, it's showing Tina in the store.  Really neat stuff.
I have no beef with this movie.  I think it's great and it gave a lot of controversy at the end for years and years until Halloween 6 finally came out.",Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers
241,WTH_MovieFan,Aimed too High And Blew It,5,12 June 2003,"With the success of Halloween 4 they rushed things and came out with this mess a year later.  Not all of the movie is that bad, the last 30 minutes are pretty interesting. There were many problems though that I thought were ridiculous. Here were my problems with the film:  bad lip syncing, Tina and other annoying characters, the introduction of the Thorn, the hideous Myers mask, and my #1 problem with the film was the Myers house. (or should I say Myers Mansion)  What were they thinking when they were selecting houses? Good grieve, ever heard of a sound stage and building your own, ""Halloween: Resurrection"" made a perfect replica of the house, they could have to back then if they hadnt been in such a rush to release this film.",Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers
242,esamer,Very fun and good Halloween Sequel!,8,4 July 2018,"I don't see why this movie got such a low rating on IMBD. I actually liked Halloween 5 a little more than 4. While part 4 was still good, I found 5 to be overall more fun and more adventures with how the plot develops. Plus this one has a more darker and scary feel to it, and it actually scared me. In this one, Jamie Loyd, Michael's niece, is mute and is in a children's care center. But she also has psychological connections with her uncle. I know it sounds a bit cheezy, but it actually plays out quite well. There is some serious tense and suspenseful scenes, in which Jamie is trying to warn people that Michael is about to kill someone, but cannot due to her muteness. This one is more campy and fun and felt more true to the slasher genre than the previous. It's also quite an exciting ride as we follow Michael and Jamie around Hadonfield and eventually to Michael's old house in a great climax! Definitely recommend this one to any Halloween or horror fan.",Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers
243,Gravedigger-2,The most underated film of the series [spoilers],7,14 October 2000,"This movie gets a lot of crap for many reasons. One is the beggining of the putrid Thorn storyline...well actually it was OK in this film...It didn't get really bad until the next chapter.Firstly, I'd like to say that this is a step up from part IV. The acting was 80% better. The characters ranged from okay to likeable. And this is the only character development we've seen from Loomis or Michael throughout the entire series. This movie actually set up to do something different, using more a more psychological rather than the same tired old formula.It takes place a year after Halloween 4, with Michael Myers apparently dead...Jamie Llyod under the care of a children's ""clinic""...and all those affected by the previous rampages trying to get on with their lives. Hoewever, Halloween time is nearing and Loomis knows that Michael is still out there. How does he know? He's a recurring character...obviously he'd know!This time Michael is becoming more and more agressively and Jamie has some sort of bond with her uncle. Now she can see what he sees. Michael uses this to sadistically torture his nine year old niece by killing off all her friends one by one and she can feel it every time it happens.
Another interesting storyline is Loomis trying to reach Michael's human side. Very, very good for a sequel.But the bad stuff brings it down. Too much of the movie was used as a set up for the next sequel and it couldn't possibly stand on it's own very well. The Myers mask could've been better..Overall, a very good slasher flick, just below the first two. If they had ditched the entire thorn thing and given us a more satisfying ending [like Michael simply being locked away in prison for the rest of his life] then this movie could've been better than the first two.I also didn't mention the excellent directing, loads of suspense, and a very agressive interpretation of Michael Myers...that makes it a good movie too. Just don't except something too much in the vein of the first film because this one is different.I prayed that he would burn in hell...but in my heart, I knew that hell would not have him!-Donald Pleasence",Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers
244,Gravedigger-2,Ok...let me try and review this movie again...,7,24 October 2000,"I feel that I didn't really say what I wanted to say the first time I reviewed it so I'm going to write another one. One thing I liked about this film was it's directing and style. Some would say that it's style over substance and maybe their right, but I liked the gothic look of the film. For example, I dug Michael's look in the film when he was unmasked. You can see him without the mask very well at the beginning of the film...long black hair, very Trent Reznorish looking...the way he sits up on the bed surrounded by candles is GREAT. The entire scene is done very well. [BTW, did anyone notice the thorn symbol appearing on Michael's hand? I'm sure you did...which leads me to my next point. People say that the man in black was stupid because he never appeared in prior films and had no real connection with the series...people say this assuming that Michael had the thorn symbol since the beginning...he didn't...(the hermit had Michael laid in a bed surrounded by candles and he kept him there for a year without telling anyone...The hermit was one of them? And maybe he was protecting Michael?) anyways it was just a subplot in this film that turned into a major plot point in Halloween VI. Anyways, Don Shanks Michael Myers is one of my favs. In the first one, he was a normal man behind a mask. In part two, he was somewhat the same only he seemed more evil. In part four, he was Jason Version 2.0 but in this one, while still retaining toughness and strength, he is a human walking time bomb...very aggressive...very angry. Not as scary as the Halloween I+II version but it makes for an entertaining movie. And that's what this movie is: entertaining. Despite it's obvious flaws, Halloween 5 is the best of the parts 3-7 era and with a few improvements could have been the best of the series. Sadly, fans didn't dig the gothic style or the interperatation of Michael Myers and his series, so a direct follow up to this film wasn't able to be filmed until five years later and it was under the worst of conditions in the worst possible hands [Joe Chapelle, Dimension Films] So Halloween Fans: Don't judge Halloween 5 on any of the other films in the series...it attempts to be different from all of them. It wasn't anything like the original because it never tries to be. Not to mention the good acting and decent storyline, there is also a lot of suspense which was missing from later entries..",Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers
245,Halloween1247,Should Have Had Jamie As The Killer,3,3 November 2015,"Halloween 5 was the least successful movie in the series for a good reason. This movie was so rushed into development that they starting shooting the movie without even a finished script. They should have gone with the first script by Shem Bitterman which had Jamie as the killer of the movie. I feel like this would have been the right direction to take the series. Instead they used the second unfinished script so they could make another generic slasher film.After Michael (Don Shanks) is shot into a mine shaft by the state police, he is swept down a river and ends up at hermits hut. Michael falls into a coma and this hermit (for some reason) nurses Michael back to health instead of calling the cops. One year later, Micheal kills the hermit and makes his way back to Haddonfield to try and kill his niece. Again.Jamie (Danielle Harris) is now a mute at a children's hospital after stabbing her step-mother last Halloween. However, this movie found a way to cheapen the ending of Halloween 4 by stating that she only did this because she and Michael are psychically connected. WTF? Anyway, now that Jamie is a mute and just sitting in a mental hospital, this means that the film has to focus on a new group of characters.Who is the new main character of this film? Rachael (Ellie Cornell) is sure to be the main character, right? No. Rachael is killed off in the first 20 minutes and we are left with her obnoxious friend Tina (Wendy Kaplan). There are few movie characters that can compete with Tina is terms of sheer annoyingness. The whole time I watched this movie I felt like Michael was sure taking his time is killing this hyperactive B**** in a maid costume.Loomis (Donald Pleasance) is also here but there isn't really any reason he is here. He does not do anything until the end film, and even then his role in minimal. Loomis does not even act like Loomis in this film. That is how out of character he is.Michael himself is a step-up from George P Wilbur's performance in the last film, but that is not saying much. The mask is this film is almost as bad as it was in Halloween 4, but I guess it is a little less cheap looking. Michael does stalk in the background like in the original film but it does not feel as scary as before. The walk is done more zombie-like this time around.The other characters in this film are just generic characters to rack up the body count. There are 2 cops that pay homage to the cops from Last House on Left with these clown sound effects. I don't know why Dominique Otherin-Girard though it would be a good idea to pay homage to one of the things that ruined a movie.The music score is the classic theme played with some different variations which sounds pretty good. Unfortunately the soundtrack is almost non-existent.Toward the end of the movie Loomis has the police set up a sting operation at the Myers house (using Jamie as bait) while waiting for Michael Myers. However a disturbance at the children's clinic causes all but 2 of the cops to leave. Michael shows up and kills the 2 cops and injures Loomis. Michael chases Jamie though the house which leads to Michael taking off his mask and crying like a F-ing baby. One of the worst parts in the series. Then Loomis catches Michael in a Scooby-Doo trap and beats Michael with a 2x4. Michael is then thrown into a jail cell. Then a man in black arrives at the police station and shoots it up and disappears with Michael.The man in black appears a couple times in the movie, so you know that he was going to do something at the end of the movie. It just makes the movie so predictable that way. Even putting that aside, Halloween 5 is a bland movie to begin with. It has so cool moments, like when Jamie is trying to climb up a laundry chute while Michael stabs the chute Jamie is in. Lots of suspense there. Donald Pleasance and Danielle Harris do great with what little they had, but it was not enough to save the film.A Step-Down From The Last Film 3/10",Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers
246,labemaster1,Crappy movie,2,17 February 2007,"Halloween is the best in the series. Halloween H20 is the 2nd best. Halloween 2 is the 3rd best.

That's not good. In fact, it's terrible. It's not worth the buying price or even the rental price. Kind of like Halloween 3. But the difference is if you see Halloween 3 on TV, you should watch it. But, if you see Halloween 5, change the channel. The acting in this one is terrible, even Donald Pleasance isn't good in this movie. Other than that, the plot is stupid, the deaths aren't good.

250,william81-1,This Time There Ready,5,11 January 2006,Halloween 5 continues the story of Jamie Myers the niece of Michael Myers who has started to follow in her uncle's footsteps since the last time we saw her. Halloween 5 is one of the more cold movies in the franchise little remorse is shown by any of the characters involved which leaves the movie feeling rather flat. Halloween 5 should be prasied for it's inventivnes towards the Michael Myers character very few franchises 5 movies would be willing to portray the homicidal manic as someone with feelings and emotions (this would have been a great movies for some backstory on the character). Most of the actors in the film don't really conect with their characters instead they paradoy previous characters even Donald Plescence performance lacks the passions of his previous performance.

251,cinemacide,Part 5 the worst? Not to me!,6,22 July 2012,"So you made it to Part 5: the ""REVENGE"" of Michael Myers. I'm willing to bet that you're a horror fan, dutifully going through the series. Awesome! So here's something to know before taking the part 5 plunge. Although Halloween is considered one of the big three of the 80's horror hierarchy, it's path was more unorthodox than the grind'em out sequels like that of Friday the 13th and Nightmare on Elm Street. After the ill fated Halloween 3 the series went dormant until Moustapha Akkard reacquired the rites and was, finally, able to cash in with sequels like all the other 80s slashers. A boom time he virtually created, I might add. While many horror-elites consider Part 4 a return to glory and often deride part 5 for it's illogical plot holes and annoying characters, it should be noted that Part 5 succeeds in spades with atmosphere, production value and cinematography where 4 does not. Making for one of the best looking sequels of the bunch. Sure it's a silly movie but it literally feels like Halloween when you watch it. Whereas Part 4 feels like a movie-of-the-week. So when fans say one is better than the other, know that, it's just not true. They're both equally goofy and quickly churned out to catch the final wave of sequel money. For complete incompetence simply look to part 6 Curse of Michael Myers.",Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers

253,Mlinville817,The series goes downhill from here,5,22 January 2011,"Halloween 5 is a disappointing movie for Halloween fans and horror movie fans. It lacks in plot, scares and suspense. It's one year later after the events of Halloween 4. Michael survives the shootings and on October 31st he returns to Haddonfield. Jamie (the heroine of H4) is in Haddonfield's Children's Hospital after attacking her step-mother the previous year. She is being treated by Dr. Loomis with the aid of her step-sister Rachel and Rachel's friend Tina. Lurking and stalking, Michael forms a plan to lure Jamie out of the children's hospital where events lead up to a confrontation at Michael's childhood house.OK, I like Donald Pleasence even though his performance went down a little and is a little cheesy. Danielle Harris does the best spending half the movie being mute. It's a great performance. Ellie Cornell is back as Rachael. She is a great character but gets killed off in the first ten minutes. The rest of the movie is filled with terribly acted, stupid teenagers. Even some of the characters from the Friday the 13th movies are better. The characters are all hateful and the script doesn't make much sense.It's a typical slasher movie, which I don't like that much. Halloween 5 spends too much time on teenagers with silly teen lust combined with slasher stuff. There's even a part with 2 bumbling cops with three stooges like music playing in the background. It's just stupid. The story feels like it doesn't know what to do next. But it does excel when it cuts to the real story of Meyers chasing the girl and the doctor's relentless pursuit. But the climax wasn't that bad, even though Michael's ""demise"" was absolutely ridicules with Loomis beating Michael with a piece of wood. Michael's childhood home looks completely different than how it looked in the first. The chase scenes with Jamie and Michael were pretty good. And a scene with Jamie hiding in a vent and Michael stabbing at it was pretty suspenseful. And it was different while being believable. That was the best part in the whole movie. Also the atmosphere is pretty good and very creepy. I would have given this 1 star if it wasn't for that.So besides the climax Halloween 5 is pretty bad.

With Dr. Loomis on his trail, Myers continues his search for his niece, Jamie.""I prayed that he would burn in hell. But in my heart, I knew that hell would not have him.""  Dr. LoomisREVIEW: Director and co-screenwriter Dominique Othenin-Girard (""Omen IV: The Awakening"") delivers the most uneven, and inconsistent film of the series. Here's a breakdown:1) Myers, comatose, is nursed back to health by an old hermit for an entire year! 2) Self-confessed ""lousy cops,"" Deputies Nick and Tom seem like a Keystone Cops rip-off that turns out to be more embarrassing than funny. 3) While, the character of Jamie is well acted, she is ill conceived here. Her psychic link seems like an extremely poor plot device, as she's able to see some killings, and others she can't. 4) In the first two Halloween films, Myers' house was a two-story Victorian house, here it's a Gothic-style mansion. (!) 5) In Halloween II, Myers was shot in the eyes, but here, his eyes seem completely unharmed.The filmmakers of this fifth installment (the fourth featuring Michael Myers) seems bent on following the ""Friday the 13th"" formula than following John Carpenter's innovative 1978 film, ""Halloween"". Here, in an overly long barn scene that seems to be lifted right out of ""Friday the 13th, Part III"" is a clichéd-filled mess. Furthermore, many of Michael's killings seem more suited for the hockey mask wearing Jason Voorhees, as he kills off the irritating, sexually obsessive teens with a rake, pitchfork, and other sharp objects. However, Myers proves his incompetence as he slaughters just about everybody except his intended victim.The film's biggest mistake was killing off the likeable Rachel, Jamie's stepsister, in the film's first twenty minutes. Instead, we are left with characters that are as irritating as you have come to expect from a low-budget slasher film. Furthermore, Donald Pleasance seems over-the-top, more of a caricature of himself instead of being ""the voice of reason"" like he was in prior installments. Unfortunately, not even Donald Pleasance can save this ""basic cookie-cutter horror movie"".Wendy Kaplan's character Tina jokingly said, ""This town should banned Halloween"". I couldn't agree more. However, even though Michael Myers is the most infamous killer in Haddonfield - that doesn't stop the town from celebrating it or selling the pale-white Shatner mask.OVERALL: Inept screenplay, shoddy direction and poor acting will make you reach for Carpenter's ""Halloween"" and yearn for the time when Michael Myers was actually an eerie horror character. *1/2 out of ****.",Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers
261,Zom-Lassic,Zom Lassic's HALLOWEEN 5 review,2,1 November 2017,"A great example of how to really mess up a great idea, and recycle it into complete stupidity. Halloween 5 is as dumb as you can get in a horror franchise, the ending in part 4 was a unique way to take, the franchise in a different, but clever direction. But no, let's just forget about intelligence, and go right for redundancy. Well as you may now know, Michael Myers has survived, what a shock!, not really. And now little Jamie played again by Danielle Harris, has a strong connection with her uncle, a psychic connection, are you kidding me, what in the world did that come from? That has absolutely nothing to do with the ending of the last movie. So it looks like we will ignore the ending of part 4, we'll talk about it a little bit, and than move on to a dumb, never explained story line of psychic links, because the producers really don't want to do nothing else, but continue with Myers as the sole killer, forget that his niece nearly killed her stepmother a year ago, let's move on, how dumb is that. Plus, this maybe the first Halloween movie to drag like crazy, yeah, Michael kills a few people here and there, but who cares, it just feels boring watching him do it, and the deaths aren't really gruesome to start with, they're just fast shots and we move on, boring, especially in the first hour. Stupid characters all over the place, including 2 of the dumbest cops in movie history, and they even have their own wacky music playing every time they show up, it's not even funny, to tell you the truth, what were the creators of this movie thinking. The most annoying character is named Tina, she's always talking, always wants to have fun, please lady just shut up and stop laughing all the time. Believe me, you'll be rooting for Michael to these people as soon as possible. And please tell me, why would Michael stop for cigarettes, the weirdest part of the movie. And how did that hermit help Michael in the beginning of the movie, it makes no sense what so ever. Even Donald Pleasence, who is usually good in these films, the bright light as I call him, is just extremely over the top in this one. But putting all of this nonsense aside, Harris gives once again a strong performance as Jamie, and is the one true bright light of Halloween 5. Bad directing, boring story line, stupid characters, bad acting except for Harris, and an ending that is in my opinion, not really effective, even though, the man in black is interesting, the ending to me is just predictable. And for a movie this is about 98 minutes long, this movie felt like it was more than 2 hours long, very boring. Halloween 5 is just basically dumb, and a real waste of time. Skip it if you can, but because the story does continue in part 6, I guess you can't, sorry.",Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers
262,behappysmile,Tina Was Not The Major Problem But One of Many Problems,4,30 October 2017,"This film was a huge creative mess. There is so many things wrong with it that this was the ""Last Halloween"" film for 6 years.The events of this film take place 1 year after ""Halloween 4"". What was a huge misfire was that ""Halloween 4"" had a brilliant ending. Sadly that gets pushed to the side for ""Halloween 5"" and so we end up getting a typical 1980's slasher film. Here is some of the problems the film had* Killing off Rachel * * The Tina Charterer* * The Comic Relief Cops* * The Stupid Soundtrack * * The Myers House Changed * * The Mask was terrible * * The Dork with the laugh * * The Introduction of the Man in Black * * Having Jamie be a mute for 1/2 the film * * The lack of individuality for any the female roles! * * Not Showing the Deaths of the cops (In the television adds we see Michael starting to attack them) * * The Ending*Now believe it or not this film could still be re-edited into a better film. By editing down the ""Tina Role"" and ""Policemen Roles"" They could also ""Edit out most of the laughs that dork does.Sadly what was wrong with this film was only magnified 6 years later in ""Halloween 6"".",Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers

I mean, come on, what could be better than an hour and a half chock full of Mr. D. Pleasance! And how about the scene where Michael drives the police car? What brilliance! But what really makes this movie unforgetable, is the final battle scene between Loomis and Michael. Whoever came up with the idea for Loomis to beat Michael for several minutes with a 2x4 should have won the Nobel Prize. And what genius to have Loomis stabbed and thrown off a balcony just minutes before! I dont know where he gets the energy, but Dr. Loomis is the most powerful character in any movie I've ever seen!
So hey, I dont want no Al Pacino, I dont want no Marlon Brando, JUST GIVE ME MY DR. LOOMIS AND IM JUST FINE!!!",Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers
264,toomatta,I hate this movie. Don't waste your time.,4,6 August 2018,"Halloween 5 is a waste of time. Donald Pleasance is not very good in this film. It was due to the director telling him to be cynical and unempathetic. He shows no remorse or sympathy when Jamie Lloyd's older sister is murdered. Jamie Lloyd is seemingly mute. Danielle Harris does give another great performance though, I must say. The ending is dumb and dragged out. The darker atmosphere is depressing (in a bad way), but not terrible. It does add to the film. Since Jamie Lloyd is mute, the focus is on the new batch of teens, for the most part. They're TERRIBLE! So unlikable, disrespectful, and obnoxious. They're really what kills this movie. Speaking of kills, they're actually pretty good. Some of my favorites in the series. The movie is just such a drag, and I don't really think it's worth 90 minutes. Overall, this isn't a truly terrible film, I just really don't like it. Good kills, good atmosphere, TERRIBLE characters, pacing, and plot devices. A very disappointing movie.",Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers

I also really liked the musical score.  One could say it's weird to have Jamie know where Michael Myers is all the time, but I didn't care.  The movie does have some gore and it does have its moments, but I still liked this film a lot.  The director must be a really talented person to have made such a wonderful movie such as this.

Seriously though, the ending of the part 4 was pretty bad and it definately set up the sequel to come into motion. You have got to consider that everything that happened, such as him trying to blown up as well was pretty bad as well. Plus the killing of some important characters and keeping the useless ones around until the end is kinda should be the other way around. The man in black is a good touch making it a mystery to where exactly Michael Myers went off too. But all in all, it was a good pick up from part 4 and on a scale from 0 to 10, I give it another 7.5.",Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers
268,themothman666,Halloween 5-The Worst of Michael Myers,3,9 February 2002,This is the worst movie in the series. No I didn't see part 3 and I don't intend to. Dominique Othenin-Girard destroyed the Halloween series. The script is awful. The directing is even worse. Now I'll occasionally watch this one because I like the Halloween series so much. The Man in Black was stupid because there was no actual payoff with him. No the ending didn't count. He is better in Halloween 6. They kill off the most likeable character in the first 20 minutes. After that person dies the whole movie goes downhill. If they didn't try to rush this in after Halloween 4 (very good movie) then maybe this movie could have been good. The acting is below average. I read about how Tina annoys everyone but surprisingly she didn't bother me. I guess it's all the horror movies I see because I have seen some horrible actors. The was supposed to be suspenseful and be a big cliffhanger. I found myself laughing because of its stupidity. The only saving graces are Dr. Loomis and Jamie. 3/10,Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers
269,angeljuuhachi,"Not the best, but not the worst.",10,17 February 2003,"Halloween 5 takes place a year from where Halloween 4 did. After stabbing her stepmom, Jamie(Danielle Harris) has stopped talking and is now in a Children's Clinic. But now she has a psychic bond with Michael, who wakes up from a coma and goes on a killing spree. Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasance) attempts to use Jamie's ability to stop him.  I read a few comments before posting my own on this movie. People brought up good points on this movie, good or bad. After Halloween 4, most people kept up their somewhat high exceptations for this movie. This was actually the first Halloween movie I saw, and maybe that's why it's one of my favorites. The script had some humorous parts, and was pretty good. The idea was also pretty good. But maybe it was the director who made this more of a let down.   The death scenes are pretty good, but after seeing the other Halloween movies, all I could concentrate on after watching this was how weird the mask looked. They said they were trying to make this as close as to the original as possible and, well, they failed.  I think the acting was really good on this one. Danielle Harris, as always, pulls off a flawless performance. Donald Pleasence was pretty good as Dr. Loomis. Ellie Cornell did really good as Rachel, who got killed off way too soon. Beau Starr, Wendy Kaplan and Tamara Glynn did good also.  This movie isn't really scary, but has it's moments, as well as some kinda touching moments. Some of my friends commented on the parts where Jamie is getting attacked by Michael really violently get a little disturbing, seeing as she's so little. (The car scene, the part where she falls down the laundry chute, ect.) This movie is good for a Friday night, and it's recommended, but barely. I give it a 7 1/2 out of 10.",Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers

271,icarus-11,As long as you know what to expect...,5,21 April 2000,"Though episode 5 is probably my least favourite of the Halloween saga (not counting H3) i still really enjoyed watching it, because i love the series as a whole and took it for what it was, something most people don't seem to do. Sure, there's some mediocre acting and the usual holes in the plot, but it's an 80's slasher film, what else would you expect? I think its obvious imperfection is its charm. Besides that, it has a few original killings and the scenes where Michael chases Jamie in the Myers house are chilling. The last half hour makes it worth watching. I'd say give it a try if you've seen other Halloween movies and liked them, if not then don't start with this one because it's certainly not one of the best. 6 out of 10 =)",Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers
272,tnoel13-5,Perhaps one of the worst horror sequels ever made.,3,20 December 2010,"There are so many things wrong with this movie. For starters all the interesting potential Halloween 4 gave the movie to work with is thrown out the window within particularly the first 10 minutes and instead we get just a standard slasher movie. Also (as it has been mention many times in the past) Rachel the one likable character in the flick, is killed off in the very beginning and replace with some of the most annoying, one dimensional teens in any horror flicks. If it was any more clear they are here just to get killed,they would have the word cannon fodder written on there heads. Dr.loomis has changed in this movie he goes from being a obsessed but overall good guy into a psychotic jerk who is pretty much bullying a little girl through out the whole movie. The flick most of the time is extremely boring which can be attributed to the fact Michael is spending most of his time stalking these unlikeable teen which makes no sense considering the fact Michael is after Jaimie. In fact there are a lot of things that don't make sense in the flick such as why did the hermit just keep Michaels body in the shack over a year, why in the end of the movie after Michael gets arrested, is he still wearing his mask and why does Michaels face look normal even though he was engulfed in flames in Halloween 2. The chase scenes in the movie are also very boring and dull. Now I will say a couple of positives Donald Pleasence and Danielle Harris do give good performances.I do like the climax of the movie with loomis capturing Michael and the man in black freeing Michael from jail(the man in black was a interesting concept) but that is about it. Had this movie not been rushed out so fast and not been given to Dominique Othenin-Girard, this could have been a good movie.",Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers

275,RBerna2473,One of the more mediocre movies in the Halloween franchise,6,27 December 2002,"After the great Halloweens 1, 2, and 4, many were hoping that 5 would live up to the standards that its three predecesors set. Unfortunately, misses that mark... and by a lot. Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers is your typical slasher film from the 80's that shows no originality or any sense of intelligence whatsoever. Sure, there are a few good scares (i.e.: the laundry shoot scene), but doesn't every slasher flick have some? The cast features a bunch of unknowns (Wendy Kaplan... Tamara Glynn... Jeffrey Landman???), and every one of the new cast members fails to impress (I was cheering Michael on to run over Tina). Meanwhile, the cast members from the previous outing show some sort of experience and are very good in their roles. Donald Pleasence is spectacular in his role as usual, though his role as Dr. Loomis seems to be getting tired. Ellie Cornell, though she's in the movie for no more than 10 minutes, plays her role as Rachel very well and gives another entertaining performance. Danielle Harris is convincing as Jamie once again, and Beau Starr plays his role as Sheriff Meeker just as well as in the fourth. Despite those few exceptions, the cast is dismal and for the most part terrible.If your looking for a mediocre slasher flick, then look no farther than Halloween 5 or anything in the Friday the 13th series. If you're looking for something more satisfying and suspenseful, turn to Halloween, Halloween 2, or Halloween 4.Rating: 4.5/10",Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers
276,autumntwilight78,Grossly underrated film,8,15 June 2005,"This entry in the infamous horror anthology came hot on the heels of the immensely successful ""Return of Michael Myers"". The producers really knew how to strike while the iron was hot, and as a result this movie did suffer from somewhat of a ""rush factor"". There are some undeniable continuity problems and other miscellaneous gaffes. But now for the good stuff, the stuff that goes largely ignored in this maligned movies' legacy.This movie has a fantastic final half hour. The kind horror movie fiends dream of. The atmospheric camera shot during the tower farm sequence. The suspense of the laundry chute scene. The tension of the police ambush at the Myers house. The emotional weight of the attic sequence between Jamie and her murderous uncle. The unleashed rage of the killings. The added mystery of the ending. All of these things and so much more make the finale of this movie SO worth any misgivings you might have about the preceding 50 minutes. Strongest finish to a horror sequel I've ever seen.Highly recommended.",Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers
277,ste-32548,Terrible,1,25 October 2018,Awful film.Made no sense why Michael didn't try to find Jamie straight away; isn't his motivation to kill his family?? Instead he stalks random teenagers to a farm house even giving one a lift for some bizarre reason. The teenagers were terrible and unlikeable and I actually rooted for Michael when he killed them.Silly comedy music was annoying. This is a horror not a comedy. Killed off Rachel at the start which was a massive mistake. At least kill her off at the end. Man in black was a stupid addition and how long has Michael had this mysterious tattoo? Did it just appear there one day because he obviously never had it when he was In hospital as a boy. Too many plot holes in this film make it frustrating to watch.

It was supposed to start right after Jamie stabbed her step mom repeatedly with the same clown suit as Michael when he stabbed Judith to death. I guess they didn't want to go that direction so six years later they made Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers (1995) and kept him as the killer. They made it that Jamie had a telepathic link with Myers and Myers some how possessed her. i say Jamie wouldn't be a good serial killer, because we all just want to have the same person who started the Halloween franchise.

I haven't seen all the sequels, but I did see Halloween 5 and contrary to most of the comments here, I thought it was very good.It was not a slash-fest. There is one killing at the beginning of the movie and then some killings during the climax at the end. But in between, there is just suspense. I thought the movie was excellent because of a scene near the end. After Michael chases his niece Jamie to the attic of his house, he slowly approaches her with his knife. Before he can stab her, she utters, ""Uncle."" Michael is visibly shaken by her utterance. You can see the rage leave Michael's body, as he becomes limp and drops the knife by his side. Jamie then says, ""Let Me See,"" as she lifts the mask from his face. You then see Michael's face and he seems contrite as he begins to cry. A closeup reveals a tear in Michael's eye.It might sound corny, but I thought it was very effective. Animals can't cry and the fact that Michael did cry showed he was human and had emotions, despite his maniacal ways. I recommend this movie.",Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers

284,shawnckasper,the Symbolism of Dr. Loomis ( SPOILERS),10,5 April 2007,"Halloween #5 has several deep psycholgical implications. I believe that there is a hidden message in the Halloween series that only gets revealed in part 5. Of course, as the sequels came out, tons of back story was implanted to achieve some sort of direction, some reason for the story to even continue, however, the symbolism of DR. Loomis really can be traced back to the Original. Many people will reject my theory, but it must be stated.As far as I'm concerned, Michael and Dr. Loomis are the same man, or at least represent the two sides of one man. 1. Samuel Loomis = simooL leumaS forward and backwards, it's the same, it's the 2 sides of one man.2. The two men are a package deal. When one shows up,the otheris always very close behind.3. Both spend their whole ""careers"" obsessed with children.4. The Dr. seems to be the ONLY person who has a fighting chance against Michael at any point during any of the films.I believe what the writer's are saying is that: You are your own worst enemy.5. Comment #4 in mind, the Dr.'s attempts to eliminate Michael, never quite get the job done. (the explosion in part 2, the use of tranquilizers instead of bullets during the climax of part 5, theuncertainty of Michael's demise by shooting at the end of #4).In other words, the Dr. doesn't REALLY want to kill his otherdark half. 6. The Dr.'s most effective attempts at subduing Michael alwaysinvolve some sort of trap or ambush. Michael is also always using ambush tactics to get what he wants.7. The Dr. is clearly speaking to himself symbolically during the ambush at Michael's house in the climax, right before Michaelslashes at Loomis's stomach. (yet ANOTHER half-hearted attempt from one half, trying to eliminate the other half). 8. The most obvious: at the end of this film, the Dr. falls faceto face with, yes, his other dark half. If this camera shot doesn't show exactly what is trying to be implied, I don't know what does.9. Dr. Loomis begins to actually CHANGE Michael's mind as seen right before the stomach slash. Little Jamie is also able to convince Michael to take off his mask!! Michael is becoming ""normal"" and he doesn't like it. That's why the Man in Black comes along. the Man in Black is now a REPLACEMENT for Dr. Loomis. Now Michael is2 halves evil, instead of half evil, half good. Ofcourse, when th MIB breaks Michael out of prison, he is Symbolically breaking Micheal out of this ""prison"" of duality!Aside from all of this, Donald Pleasance did his best work in any of this series here, in #5. Notice the long unbroken takes, throughout the film, especially the one with young mute Jamie where he frantically demands information from her.",Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers

In number 2 he is shot in both eyes and burned to a crisp. They should have done minimal makeup to show visible scarring and refrained from showing his eye. By doing it the way they did, the audience is left to feel like it's not the same guy. Keep his face shadowed and make Jaime jump from the site of his face and that's why he freaks out and starts slashing. Opinions aside, I love all these movie.
