0,SnoopyStyle,too much of a good thing,5,23 May 2015,Lenny Cole (Tom Wilkinson) is a ruthless London mob boss masterminding a corrupt real estate deal. Russian developer Uri Omovich gives his lucky painting to Lenny but it goes missing. Uri uses corrupt accountant Stella (Thandie Newton) who in turn double-crosses Uri by getting One-Two (Gerard Butler) and the Wild Bunch to steal the money.Guy Ritchie is returning to his London gangster movie roots. It's overload with wild characters and hard talk. There is so much going on that it's hard to concentrate on one particular thing. It's a case of too much of a good thing. This is all style and big talk. There are too many characters and too many interconnected plot lines.,RocknRolla
1,claudio_carvalho,"Money, Sex, Drugs, Rock 'n' Roll  and a Lucky Painting",8,21 March 2009,"In London, the British mob boss Lenny Cole (Tom Wilkinson) rules the growing real estate business using a corrupt Councilor (Jimi Mistry) for the bureaucratic services and his henchman Archy (Mark Strong) for the dirty work. When he lures the small time criminals One Two (Gerard Butler) and Mumbles (Idris Elba) in a transaction, they lose their property and owe two million pounds to Lenny. Meanwhile the Russian entrepreneur and Russian mob boss Uri Omovich (Karel Roden) meets Lenny for a real estate business and Lenny charges seven-million Euros for the deal; Uri accepts, calls his accountant Stella (Thandie Newton) to laundry and raise the necessary funds and lends his lucky painting to Lenny to bring success and fortune to their business. However Stella double-crosses Uri and hires One Two and Mumbles to steal the amount while the painting is stolen from Lenny's wall by his addicted rocker stepson Johnny Quid (Toby Kebbell).""Rocknrolla"" is another great movie of Guy Ritchie in the same style of ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"". The complex and intelligent screenplay entwines characters and funny situations and the result is an entertaining movie with witty lines and excellent acting. Tom Wilkinson is fantastic in the role of a powerful crime lord. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Rocknrolla""",RocknRolla
2,kosmasp,He's back,8,26 April 2009,"Not that Guy Ritchie ever went away. But after his split-up with Madonna 2008, he came back in the public eye. His previous movie, ""Revolver"", didn't really attract many people, which might have to do, with the very complex structure of that movie. Quite definitely has to do something with that.But with ""RocknRolla"" he takes a step back (sort of) and takes on known territory. While it never achieves to be as good as his first two movies (imho), it shows that Guy hasn't lost his touch. Not that he would care, what people think, as I read in a recent article in the EMPIRE Magazine, but he just feels comfortable in this type of movie. While he hasn't done a sequel to one of his movies (yet), they do feel like they have a common base. So again, if you did like ""Lock, Stock..."" and ""Snatch"", then this is an absolute must-see for you",RocknRolla
3,classicsoncall,"""What do you think we are, gangsters?""",8,16 October 2018,"One thing about Guy Ritchie's movies - you definitely need a scorecard to keep track of the players. They come and go repeatedly and rapidly, and a minute's worth of distraction can lead to a misinterpretation of the story. In this one, just about everyone is a bad guy, it's just that some are badder than others. I got a kick out of all of them, even if some of the character motivations fly in the face of reality. Like Johnny Quid (Toby Kebbell) committing multiple suicides in order to boost his income. I don't see how that would fly, but for the purpose of this picture it works well enough. Or the idea that Uri's delivery boys would get knocked off not once but twice for the seven million euros. Seems like an awful stretch to me. There also seems to be multiple loose ends left dangling when the story is over, such as the fate of Stella (Thandie Newton) and the Councillor (Jimi Mistry), something you might not think about until well after the film is over. The one thing not left dangling is the misfortune of real estate kingpin Lenny Cole (Tom Wilkinson), who's appointment with the fishes brings to mind the demise of Luca Brasi in ""The Godfather""; he sleeps with them don't you know. So it's been a decade since we got a tease of a sequel with Johnny Quid getting clean and presumably working his way into Lenny's old stomping grounds. I'd still welcome one after all these years, because if you like Guy Ritchie's pictures, you can't get enough. Maybe I'll just go back and watch this one all over again.",RocknRolla
4,jboothmillard,RocknRolla,4,27 September 2020,"I'm very half and half when it comes to director Guy Ritchie. He's done at least two great movies: Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, and Snatch; he's done a few average films: Sherlock Holmes, Aladdin; and he's done a lot of stinkers: Swept Away, Revolver, King Arthur. This is one of his films I always recognised the title of, and I was hoping it would be one of his films I would enjoy. Basically, in London, Lenny Cole (Tom Wilkinson) rules the real estate business underworld, with the help of his corrupt Councillor (Jimi Mistry) and his right-hand man Archy (Mark Strong). Billionaire Russian businessman, Uri Omovich (Karel Roden), is planning a major new deal, and many crooks want a piece of it. This includes Uri's underhanded accountant Stella (Thandie Newton), and ""The Wild Bunch"" gang, led by small-time crook ""One-Two"" (Gerard Butler), his partner ""Mumbles"" (Idris Elba), and their driver, ""Handsome Bob"" (Tom Hardy). Uri and Cole agree a price, and as a sign of trust, Uri loans Lenny his ""lucky painting"". Uri arranges for Stella to move the funds, but she double-crosses him, along with the Wild Bunch, while Lenny's junkie stepson Johnny Quid (Toby Kebbell) steals the valuable painting. Johnny's American managers Mickey (Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges) and Roman (Jeremy Piven) are coerced into helping Lenny and Archy track him down. In a subplot, Handsome Bob gets close to Stella's gay husband, who knows a long-time informer with information that could put Bob in prison. Uri tasks Stella once more to covertly arrange a payoff, and again the Wild Bunch rob the moneymen, and Omovich's right-hand man Victor (Dragan Micanovic) is convinced Lenny is behind the robberies. Uri and Victor invite Lenny for a private game of golf on a golf course, where Victor beats him savagely with a golf club, finishing by breaking Lenny's leg as a warning to him. Cookie (Peep Show's Matt King) buys the painting from druggies, who gives it to One-Two, who, after a sexual encounter, offers it to Stella for her help. After Stella leaves, One-Two is surprised by Uri's henchmen, but Archy and his goons rescue and kidnap him, they are looking for Uri's money. Uri wants to marry Stella, but he finds out that she has the painting, and angered tells Victor to kill her. Archy brings Johnny, Roman, Mickey and the Wild Bunch to Lenny's warehouse where Lenny orders Johnny executed. He threatens to kill the Wild Bunch ""very slowly"" unless they give back the money they stole. Handsome Bob offers legal documents concerning the informant to Archy, who recognises that they are related to Lenny, who has been arranging for criminals to routinely arrested to enhance his presence in the criminal underworld and guarantee his own freedom. Archy orders Lenny's men to free the Wild Bunch and has Lenny drowned and fed to crayfish. Johnny explains to Roman and Mickey that they will also be killed to leave no witnesses, and graphically explains how they will be executed. However, Johnny, Mickey and Roman manage to overcome and kill the would-be executioner and shoot other men waiting for them and they escape with help from One-Two and the Wild Bunch. Later, Archy picks up Johnny from rehab and gives him Uri's lucky painting as a welcome home gift, explaining how hard it was to get his hands on it. Johnny is relieved to be free of the drugs and his stepfather and hopes he can now ""become a real RocknRolla"". Also starring Geoff Bell as Fred the Head, and Gemma Arterton as June. It is a good cast of well-knowns and rising stars, all are given fairly slick and recognisable gangster dialogue, there are some dodgy deals and gun fights along the way, but it was not as sparky or exciting as it could have been, an average crime action. Okay!",RocknRolla
5,paul_haakonsen,Good movie...,6,1 January 2016,"This movie actually turned out to be better than I had anticipated. I initially picked up this movie because of Gerard Butler stars in it.While the story does seem a bit confusing at first, give it some time to sink in. It was actually an interesting story, especially as it was the same story just told from different sides of the table, so to speak.I can't claim to be overly familiar with the work of Guy Ritchie, although I do know of him by his name. I found ""RocknRolla"" to be a well-directed movie.The cast in ""RocknRolla"" is rather good and people really performed quite well in their individual roles, each one adding their own spice and flavor to the movie.It was nice to see a movie of this type which wasn't just all gunfights and brawling. So a big thumbs up to Guy Ritchie for his achievement with ""RocknRolla"".""RocknRolla"" is well-worth watching, and the 115 minutes it runs for just fly by so quickly because you get sucked up into the movie right from the very beginning, and yes, it is that entertaining.",RocknRolla
6,blanche-2,Johnny Quid - great character,7,28 September 2015,"Gerard Butler, Tom Wilkinson, Thandie Newton, Idris Elba, Tom Hardy, Jeremy Piven, and Tony Kebbell star in ""RocknRolla,"" a Guy Ritchie film from 2008.Wilkinson plays Lenny Cole, a London mobster into illegal real estate transactions. He's currently working with the Russians, in particular a developer, Uri Omovich. Omovich loans Cole his ""lucky painting,"" which is actually quite valuable. However, the painting is stolen.Cole's men are dispatched to find it. Meanwhile, three small-time crooks who call themselves The Wild Bunch, steal money for the Russian's accountant (Newton). This keeps Wilkinson from making an important deal, but he promises to get the money.A drug-addicted rocker, Johnny Quid, is reported dead from drowning. Turns out he has important information.Excellent performances all around, with Wilkinson playing a man tough and mean as dirt, capable of anything to get what he wants. The Wild Bunch are all great and contribute much to this story of betrayal, disloyalty, and mistrust that somehow manages to also be funny.Then there is Johnny Quid. Toby Kebbell is amazing, and that's all I'll say. A brilliant performance. I liked the way the plots came together and how the film managed to have so much humor when parts were, in fact, violent. There are some great scenes - I particularly loved the first 7 million pound robbery, and the huge chase scene that went on and on.Well worth seeing.",RocknRolla
7,Quinoa1984,"good try, but not quite cigar for Ritchie on this one",6,2 November 2008,"One hopes Guy Ritchie, as with another filmmaker of his age-range Kevin Smith, may grow more as filmmakers as the years go on, but at the moment one senses a kind of rut in the process. It's not even that RocknRolla is an entirely bad film or is unwatchable. On the contrary there are one or two scenes and moments in RocknRolla that could be considered as some of the most accomplished and funny directing and writing Ritchie has done in his relatively short career. But he's also playing on now tired chords; it's like, basically, Scorsese-lite done to a cup of tea and music video ""attitude"" pushed to 11. Which, in all actuality, is like what Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and Snatch were like, which means lots of colorful street characters with colorful language to match, narration, rock music placed in at every turn possible, and doses of black humor that come with the territory. Personally, I'll go back to Scorsese next time around.In RocknRolla we get the story (or interwoven stories) of criminals in the midst of a land deal that also involves 7 million changing hands between a Russian, an 'old-timer' (Wilkinson), a new younger gang called the Wild Bunch (including One-Two played by Gerard Butler), a seductive lawyer (Thandie Newton, definitely her sexiest yet), and the RocknRolla of the title, Johnny Quid. There's also a 'lucky painting' that mucks up the work as the local MacGuffin of the piece (we never do see what the painting is, so who's to say why it appears so lucky), and a couple of lowly record producers attached to Quid that get rolled into the mess. All the while Ritchie treats these threads kind of in the mode of 'business as usual', while throwing a bone here and there to a new (or used) idea and some funny dialog, like about a recurring, hard slap, a closet-gay member of the Wild Bunch (the revelation scene is actually very well acted, but soon devolves into a so-so joke), and a note-for-note remake of a specific plot detail from Snatch, with crayfish replacing pigs as the choice of the old-man villain's ""we have ways of killing you/making you talk"" device.Most of the performances are well enough for the film (save for Piven and Ludicrous, who have nothing to do and are there as window-dressing), and there is one particular sequence where the Wild Bunch get embroiled in a robbery-gone-bad and an ensuing chase with the Russians that is a fantastic and uproarious sliver of genre film-making. But all the same, for all the attitude, for all the cool rock songs like The Clash's 'Bankrobber', and for the eventual ""twist"" that should come a mile away, it feels a little left-out-of-the-fridge. This isn't to say that Ritchie isn't faring better than his previous effort, Revolver, which saw him trying to experiment as a surrealist and falling flat on his face. Yet, is it too much to exclaim ""huh!"" when one sees at the end of the film a title card which proclaims in serial-mode to ""tune in next time for... The Real RocknRolla!"" How can there be enough for a sequel, let alone the proposed RocknRolla trilogy, when it merely comes off as a less consistently entertaining version of Ritchie's first two movies? Can there be such a thing, in short, as delusions of genre? I think so, even when it's sometimes a very good show. 6.5/10",RocknRolla
8,michaelRokeefe,A Guy Ritchie crime caper.,6,9 March 2009,"Discribing ROCKnROLLA is like trying to do a play-by-play of five blind mice with catnip on their tales hiding in a cat carriage. A very manic crime comedy with plenty of action. London's underworld becomes the playground of every schemer and criminal big and small. Russian mob elements orchestrate a lucrative riverfront property scam getting the interest of a ruthless crime boss(Tom Wilkinson), who is finally getting the screws put to him; a small-time local criminal(Gerard Butler)and a corrupt accountant(Thandie Newton)are joined by a punk rocker(Toby Kebbell), who is faking his own death, embroiled in wanting a piece of the real estate scheme.I enjoyed Richie's SNATCH a whole lot better. But this kinetic face-smashing gangster caper will keep you laughing. This flick is definitely intended for mature audiences only. Also in the cast: Jimi Mistry, Jeremy Piven, Mark Strong, Karel Roden and Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges.",RocknRolla
9,hitchcockthelegend,Don't worry. He can't defend himself - he's got no head.,8,10 June 2010,"When a land deal goes wrong for One Two (Gerard Butler) and Mumbles (Idris Elba) they have to steal seven large to pay back underworld fixer Lenny Cole (Tom Wilkinson). Aided by accountant Stella (Thandie Newton) they make the hit and think that's the end of the matter. Only it isn't because now the can is open and there is worms every where. Worms involving a shady Russian business man, his favourite painting and a junkie rock star who keeps on dying!.It's interesting viewing RocknRolla now just after Guy Ritchie's reinvention of Sherlock Holmes has put him back on the flavour of the month list. For at the time of its release Ritchie was on the back of a couple of critical bombs and was of course then known as Mr Madonna. The press and the film critics seemingly revelling in giving the bright director a good old cockney kicking after putting him on a pedestal with the success of the Lock, Stock and Snatch movies. Don't get me wrong, Swept Away is awful and Revolver, while not being the cess pool of vomit some would have you believe, is just too much labyrinthine plotting around a poor narrative story. But had Ritchie lost his mojo in 2008? Is it true that he got lucky with his cockernee gangster forays?.Well what we know to be true is that Ritchie is comfortable back on the shady London manor that is at the heart of RocknRolla. Cynics will say he has played safe and returned to the formula that made him. Yeah, so what? A return to form is a return to form is it not? Besides which, if one is prepared to delve deep and examine RocknRolla, you will find that it's more polished than both Lock, Stock and Snatch; with a far better cast of actors able to fully realise the zippy structure and material of the piece. No! Ritchie is no great story teller yet, and judging by the plot of Sherlock Holmes, he's unable to spot a duff story either. Yet the vigour, vibrancy, and all round geezerness of RocknRolla is bountiful as a ream of charismatic characters all have stories within the story. Ritchie returning to gangland territory with guns, gags and sexual energy is a good thing. It really is.The cast are uniformly strong. The roll call contains Mark Strong, Gerard Butler, Tom Wilkinson, Tom Hardy, Thandie Newton, Jeremy Piven, Jimmy Mistry, Idris Alba, Chris Bridges and Gemma Arteton. All of whom seem to enjoy being in ""that type"" of Guy Ritchie movie. But it's Toby Kebbell as junkie rock star Johnny Quid that shines the brightest. He's no stranger to fans of harder edged British cinema, his brilliant turn in Dead Man's Shoes often gets forgotten because of Paddy Considine's much lauded turn in that film. While Wilderness, and then Control, further pushed him forward as a major British talent. Here he covers many bases in character while the material lets him slyly dig at the music industry and link it feral like to the underworld. A terrific turn from a terrific young actor.With a kicking soundtrack that includes the likes of The Clash, The Hives, The Subways, Lou Reed and The Sonics, it's not just the crime caper plot that positively pings. There's some links to Pulp Fiction, a painting we never see echoes the running suitcase gag, while a wonderful dance sequence between Butler and Newton of course nods to Uma & John. But it's fine, this is Ritchie's world and its fun, sexy and cunningly dangerous. 8/10",RocknRolla
10,Scarecrow-88,RocknRolla,7,30 May 2009,"""Oh, beauty is a beguiling call to death and I'm addicted to the sweet pitch of it's siren.""This is another one of those British gangster movies which focuses on low-level criminals, high-level criminals, and wealthy Russian immigrants wanting to be major players in the city as well, all desiring London property for the price is going up substantially. You have major crime lord Lenny(Tom Wilkinson), who always seeks more and more, the greedy bastard and his business dealings with a potential partner, from Russia, Uri Omovich(Karel Roden) wanting property but others(..such as accountant, Stella, played by Thandie Newton)interfere with their negotiations. The Wild Bunch, a group of locals who rob and steal, One Two(Gerard Butler), Mumbles(Idris Elba), and Handsome Bob(Tom Hardy) called upon by Stella to steal from Uri's men handling the dough, with Lenny's pipe-addicted, emotionally unstable step-son, Johnny Quid(Toby Kebbell) stealing a painting(..Uri's ""lucky painting"" he loans to Lenny as a means of seasoning their relations during the scamming process) that really throws a dent in his highly ambitious plans.The painting is almost like the rifle of WINCHESTER 73, it changes hands a few times and remains the most nagging crack in the relations of Uri and Lenny. The idea that the painting is in the possession of Quid, a popular rocknrolla who has remained a recluse, burnt out, wallowing away in a filthy hideaway, hooked on drugs, is kind of very funny..particularly because this keeps Lenny from succeeding as he so often does, getting rich off of others. The idea that The Wild Ones, local guys who Lenny screws out of real-estate(..he has channels no one else does, viciously cutthroat and dishonest), actually steal money from the very Russians who are to pay him is rather humorous as well. Stella, out of boredom, initiates the thefts she knows about due to her being an accountant for Uri..giving One Two the whereabouts so his boys can successfully lift the money from the Russian gang. And, a nice touch is how Quid's former managers(Ludicrous and Jeremy Piven, who make an entertaining duo) get pulled into the mess.You see, the painting seems to do that to everyone, those who come in contact with the painting, directly or indirectly, pay a heavy price..it's not such a ""lucky"" painting. There are some heavily stylized moments throughout director Guy Ritchie's tour-de-force of colorful gangsters and their downfalls at the hands of fate. Through entertaining methods, Ritchie also allows, in cunning ways, his more likable criminals to escape some pretty hairy situations, such as One Two's danger at the hands of two hard-to-kill Russian assassins(..their dogged quest to stop The Wild Ones from getting away with their master's loot is quite a sight), and how Quid is able to maneuver out of being executed(..along with his managers)by Lenny's men. A major sub-plot, an informant(..whistler blower)who has ratted out all the criminals which live within the city, develops quietly, roaring loudly at the end, his identity shaking the foundation of the underworld forever. Jimi Mistry is the ""Councillor"", the ""immigrant"" who Lenny depends on to get his developments under way. Lots of flashy camera work and dialogue(..I can't imagine people like Lenny actually talking like this, particularly his use of craw fish to spook a junkie for information) as expected by Ritchie whose films regarding the criminal underworld always seem a bit cartoonish. Big role for Mark Strong as Lenny's lieutenant, Archy, the one depended on to straighten things out for his boss(..he narrates the movie, offering his own views regarding people he talks about throughout). The discovery that One Two's best friend Handsome Bob is homosexual is rather an amusing development, particularly when it comes to uncovering the identity of the informant. Ritchie really cuts scene to scene fast, and the film could drive some batty as the plot moves rather quickly from one situation to another, barely catching a breath.",RocknRolla
11,LeonLouisRicci,Not Much,4,8 January 2013,"Oh it's all so funny. Not. This keeps firing scene after scene connected with now dated ""modern"" editing and hyper displays of distortion, trying so hard, to make you laugh. It is a self conscious affair of a style that once worked as innovative and interesting that now is nothing more than more of the same.It all looks so modern. Not. The movie is an exercise in excessive turns of procedure with a script so lame and laden with hip conceits and posturing that it comes off as a bloated beast. It is witless and is overdone and laid out as a cool entrance into the street life. It parades these beasties with ""attention grabbing"" nicknames like One-Two, Mumbles, and Handsome Bob. So clever.An intriguing plot. Not. It's a lame ""macguffin"" about a missing painting that is so ho-hum as to be insulting, as are most of the characters and the uninteresting dialog and monologues. It is an empty movie that is juvenile junk about junkies and the money grubbing upper crust. It really stinks and sinks under its own pretentious weight. Nothing more than sickening sweet eye candy that is an overdose of overdone self-parody laughing at itself. At least someone is amused.",RocknRolla
12,CinemaSerf,"""Daddy... Nice wheels...""",7,8 May 2020,"I really enjoyed this. A great ensemble cast delivering a gangster thriller that pokes it's tongue out at just about everything/body whilst still retaining enough menace to keep it engaging. As ever with Ritchie films, it does run a bit to dialogue - and this one has an, at times, irritating narrative. Tom Wilkinson (""Lenny"") is quite good as the mob boss who facilitates - and takes a cut from - most big property transactions in London; and he makes a good living from it. A Russian oligarch arrives on the scene and engages Lenny, and his slimy but ruthless sidekick ""Archy"" (Mark Strong) to help his with a fairly mammoth development. At this stage it all starts to go a bit pear shaped and we slowly become aware that there is much more afoot. There are several fun subplots with Gerard Butler, Idris Elba, Tom Hardy and Thandie Newton all having some skin in at least part of the game; and Toby Kebbell is cracking as his dead-loss, rockstar, coke-head son ""Johnny Quid"". The writing is taut and humorous, and the violence much more ""fantasy"" and implied - even kinky, on occasion, than gory. The whole thing is a thoroughly entertaining piece of cinema - complete with killer lobsters and the smallest of cameos from Hugh Grant!",RocknRolla
13,dbborroughs,Well made and well done-but I've seen this before,6,18 October 2008,"(This review will probably not help anyone) The new Guy Richie movie is like Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, Snatch and Layer Cake only more so. Its hip, its happening and very well made. For the life of me I couldn't tell you what happens in it or why you should care to see it other than its not bad for what it is. What it is is a knock off of the three earlier films by Richie and Matthew Vaughn that is certainly better then Revolver, but nothing special on its own, especially if you've seen the earlier films. I've been there and done that and didn't need to feel that I've wasted my time watching a tread. Is Guy Ritchie that limited of a talented filmmaker? I'd wait for cable.",RocknRolla

You are left wondering who will be on top at the end.Gerard Butler, Idris Elba, Tom Hardy, Tom Wilkinson, and Karel Roden all make this an interesting film, and you add the luscious Thandie Newton in the mix, oh boy!

17,view_and_review,"Smart, Funny, Exciting",7,21 June 2021,"Another Guy Ritchie special--lots of characters who are all interconnected.

18,neil-476,Good fun if overdone in places,7,11 September 2008,"Guy Ritchie ventures into territory which is already familiar from Lock, Stock, And Two Smoking Barrels, Snatch etc. - a London-based underworld ranging from small-time losers to big-time underworld bosses, all of whom are able to lob out incendiary wisecracks at the drop of a hat. The plot this time concerns the theft - twice - of bribe money which is needed to get a dodgy planning application through. For such a simple idea, the movie is plotted very densely and is festooned with coincidences. Well, OK, I could cope with that.But there were two further elements which did rather lose me, I'm afraid. One of these concerned the stepson of the crime boss - a junkie pop star who was faking his own death in order to boost record sales - and the other concerned the travels of a ""lucky painting"" which belonged to the Russian property developer, which seemed to pass through the hands of pretty nearly every member of the cast at one point or another. Both these elements were unnecessary and - in my view - detracted from the film rather than adding to it, mainly because neither of them was very credible.The performers, seasoned pros all, delivered decent characters, although Thandie Newton perhaps rather overdid the moody smouldering. It was good to see Ritchie moving away from his familiar repertory company.I may be alone in being uneasy at someone turning out a series of films in which every single character is disreputable, where the ""hero"" (by which I mean the character which the audience is clearly intended to root for) is a cute lovable armed robber, and he's top of the heap in terms of morality.And the sequences dealing with how One Two dealt with Handsome Bob's revelation were very funny (if politically incorrect). Entertaining, but often ear-splittingly loud.",RocknRolla
19,ferguson-6,Beauty is a Dangerous Mistress,7,3 November 2008,"Greetings again from the darkness. OK, I will admit that my humor runs more to Guy Ritchie than Judd Apatow, and that my rating of this movie is purely on my tastes rather than the barometer of mass appeal. Writer/director Ritchie has escaped the clutches of Madonna and is now free to display his movie-making talents again.""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" and ""Snatch"" were FUN, FRENZIED and FASCINATING. This film is a bit more up to date, certainly easier to follow, but every bit as much fun as those two classics. When Ritchie is in his element, we are bombarded with numerous unique characters all crossing multiple story lines at a pace that not only prevents potty breaks, but often penalizes blinking.The list of characters here include Gerard Butler as One-Two, a macho second rate gangster who wants more; Tom Hardy and Idris Elba as his partners in crime; Toby Kebbell as junked-out rocker Johnny Quid, who appears to be a take-off on Pete Doherty; Thandie Newton as the most bizarre accountant ever encountered; Karel Roden and Tom Wilkinson as battling gangsters, proudly Russian and American; and Mark Strong (Body of Lies) who teaches the backhand slap with panache.On a down note, I did not include Ludicrous and Jeremy Piven, who play a couple of band managers and club owners, because their roles seemed quite contrived ... as if written in at the last minute to include buds of Ritchie. Still, this is a minor point and has no real impact on the enjoyment of the film.Viewing the film, one has to believe that it is an actor's dream. There seems to be no limit which they can't strive for in any given scene. Wilkinson chews up his lines as if he has just bitten into a rotten grapefruit. Same with Mark Strong and Tony Kebbell who are both just terrific.Two of the funniest scenes involve Gerard Butler and Thandie Newton sharing the most unusual dance since Adam West and Julie Newmar in the Batman TV series; and again Butler and Newton in a patented Ritchie lovemaking session replete with quick cuts. Butler also offers up a dance scene with Handsome Bob ... but that's a whole other story line.Undoubtedly the film will not appeal to mass audiences, but I do believe there are many people who enjoy the experience if they would just give it a shot.

It regards a huge real estate player in London who addresses high profile citizens as pawns. He can make success or disaster arrive to anyone depending where they stand on his level of trust. Directed by Guy Ritchie with the same style he brought to Love, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and Snatch. This film delivers a playful use of violence as seen in those other films that toys with its entertainment placement. Gerard Butler plays a gangster who gets caught up in a web of crime, deceit and forbidden love until his violent lifestyle becomes the answer. Tom Wilkinson plays the wealthy honcho buying off situations and people until a sudden plot twist has him on the other end of disaster. Mark Strong plays Wilkinson's right hand man who figures out that certain people are not who they seem and he attempts to set the records straight. Thandie Newton plays a contact of sly seduction who double crosses her contact, seduces Butler, and ultimately discovers that her nature can only ploy so long before it catches up to her. Tom Hardy plays a gangster and closet homosexual who may have eyes for the Butler character. Well crafted film that presents gangster type lifestyles as anything but pleasant. Score: 8 / 10",RocknRolla
21,FlashCallahan,"Think, before you drink, before you drive me mad......",5,28 June 2015,"Lenny Cole, a London mob boss, puts the bite on all local real estate transactions. For a substantial fee, he helps Uri Omovich, a Russian developer. As a sign of good faith, he loans Cole a valuable painting, promptly stolen off Cole's wall. While Cole's men, led by Archie, look for the canvas, three local petty criminals, the Wild Bunch, steal money from the Russian using inside information from his accountant, Stella. Meanwhile, a local drug-addled rocker, Johnny Quid, is reported drowned, and his connection to Cole is the key to unravelling the deceits and double crosses of life in the underworld.......Guy Ritchie has a lot to answer for. He resurgence the British film industry somewhat with LSATSB, and invented a new genre with that film, the genre of wide boy gangsters talking quite poetic in a narrative, and seamlessly branching several narratives into a for filling conclusion.And since then, we have been inundated with some terrible, awful, poisonous copycats. So in a way, he helped, and then catapulted us back into the Stone Age.And this movie again proves that he was a one trick pony. All the impressive visuals, impressive cast, and equally impressive soundtrack, cannot hide the fact that Ritchie is useless without Matthew Vaughn. Look at Vaughns resume compared to the auteur's, and you realise that Vaughn was a pinnacle in Ritchie's writing.So again, as it is standard with these films, we have the crime lord who swears, shouts really loud, and uses slang in every other sentence.Then we have our antihero, with his ragtag team of mates, who all have their own traits, and use slang in every other sentence.And then finally, the crime lords sidekick, usually the narrator of the Basil exposition, is the clever one, the poetic one, and the one with whom reason is imperative.Throw in a few more characters with quirky traits, and you have this film, and it's a mess.There a double cross here, a double cross there, something gets stolen, and all the flashy editing and camera work cannot save it from the offensive mess that it is.It's homophobic, sexist, agoraphobic, and one of the most chauvinistic piles of rubbish I've seen in a longtime.And it's boring to boot.Stick with the Long Good Friday, the film that this is basically ripping off.",RocknRolla
22,gradyharp,Guy Ritchie and Style,8,1 February 2009,"A number of years ago young director Guy Ritchie changed mobster movies with his infectious LOCK, STOCK AND TWO SMOKING BARRELS and that twisted underbelly of London's crime population is back in full force with ROCKNROLLA. Ritchie's style - mixing rapid action, flashback explanations, loopy violence, wildly imaginative characters, and a near non-understandable collection of various accents from the British Isles coupled with an integral musical score - makes this tale of deceit, desperation, intrigue, vice in all forms, low on the food chain criminals at service in the line of polished professionals - a fast paced highly entertaining movie. The script (yes, by Ritchie, too) combines narration with live conversation, a trait that can be distracting, but that in Ritchie's hands adds a layer of commentary and needed background that helps the viewer keep the many bits and pieces of plots screwed together. The Old School crime lord is played by Tom Wilkinson in a role far different from his previous roles. His nemesis is the New School crime lord Russian Uri (Karel Roden) with odd demands and a 'lucky painting' we never see. Gerard Butler pals with Idris Elba and the gay character Morne Botes in a back and forth series of thwarted attempts to gain status in the smarmy crime world headed by Wilkinson. The name character of Rocknrolla (pop star Johnny Quid) is well played by Toby Kebbell, Thandie Newton offers the touch of glamour as a twisted accountant, and Jeremy Piven, Chris Bridges (Ludacris), Jimi Mistry and narrator/star Archie (Mark Strong) pull it all together. This film definitely has an audience for those who appreciate the skills of Ritchie as writer/director. For others, it may be a bit hard to follow the technique of dishing out this tangled tale. Grady Harp",RocknRolla
23,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: RocknRolla,7,7 October 2008,"Guy Ritchie is probably right at home with his own brand of English crime capers, which is full of machismo over the top action sequences, tough talking, black comedy, and an all round edgy feel to it, not to mention the frequent casting of Jason Statham, who has since moved on from the Smoking Barrels, Snatch and Revolver days. In fact, it's been a good 8 years since we last saw Ritchie's feature films on screen, since Revolver had a straight to DVD release here, and Ritchie's widely panned effort with Swept Away starring his wife Madonna being avoided with a ten foot pole.So with RocknRolla, Guy Ritchie can announce and signal his comeback to the much loved genre where he's probably a master of, except that this film still had much to be desired, albeit containing elements of his signature style. We go back to the usual crooked czar where Tom Wilkinson's Lenny Cole heads a small team of gangsters who fleece unsuspecting land / home buyers in real estate, until such time where he thought he had a big fish for the kill in the coming of a wealthy Russian mobster. But after the same pot of gold, knowingly or unwittingly getting themselves embroiled in the big scheme of things, include Thandie Newton's accountant Stella, Gerard Butler's small time hoodlum One-Two, and a rock star Jonny Quid (Toby Kebbell), a druggie who fakes his own superstardom death.While you can't fault the good ol' almost watertight linking of everyone to everyone else, the narrative did feel that it needed some nip and tuck as it does tend to indulge in itself a little by getting too meandering in its presentation, throwing up a chock full of supporting roles by Ludicrous or Jimi Mistry the corrupt Councillor. One example of such an indulgence happened to be one of the more entertaining action sequences involving some hard to put down Russian gangsters, who were much like robotic Terminators with Energizer fuel cells that keep going on and on, though it did serve its purpose with self-deprecating humour for a character to trumpet his own horn.And the characters here are a mixed bunch, most of whom were the stars in a relatively simple black versus black plot. The lead narrator Archie (Mark Strong) tends to stay out of the picture most of the time, seemingly comfortable to passing the baton to Butler who relatively has more star power, but Wilkinson single handedly steals the show with his gangster who made it big through the misfortune of others who fall for his cunningness. Thandie Newton as the seductress never really get much to do here except to pout and roll her eyes, despite touting to be the best in the business in creative accounting. You can count on Ritchie to conjure some really visually attractive scenes and sequences, coupled with some memorable dialogue. Though I must admit that RocknRolla here did seem a little bit homophobic, especially when there's a running joke that runs throughout the film involving One-Two and fellow peer Handsome Bob (Tom Hardy) that went on for a tad too long, although I must admit some of it were genuinely hilarious in its own right, especially when left to your own devices to imagine what transpired given the deliberate omission of crucial details stemming from character embarrassment. And running along the same idea of a gag in letting your imagination run wild, is the make up of a valuable lucky painting that you just don't get to see.All in all, RocknRolla still proved itself to be quite an entertaining feature, and for fans of Ritchie, the wait is finally over. Not his greatest work to date, but nothing too shabby either.",RocknRolla
24,Buddy-51,another stylish Ritchie gangster film,7,8 February 2009,"There may be only a few surefire things when it comes to movie-going these days, but one of the surest is that, in any film written and directed by Guy Ritchie, your mind will have to race mighty fast just to keep up with all the characters and plot conniptions that will go speeding by you through the course of the story.His latest film, ""RocknRolla"" is clearly no exception to that rule. The movie contains virtually all of the patented Ritchie trademarks familiar to us from such works as ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" and the truly incomprehensible ""Snatch"" (though viewers should know that ""RocknRolla"" is nowhere near as complicated as that film). Like those others, this movie is bursting at the seams with an assortment of colorful criminal types, flashes of wicked humor, sudden explosions of violence, pitch-perfect performances, a too-cool-for-school rock soundtrack, and whipsaw editing guaranteed to leave you with a serious crick in your neck by the time the experience is over.As usual, the criminals are culled from virtually every strata of London society, running the gamut from corrupt real estate moguls to two-bit henchmen who seem always to be one step away from being rubbed out themselves. This latter group includes ""300""'s Gerard Butler, Idris Elba (Stringer Bell in ""The Wire"") and Tom Hardy as a trio of crooks known affectionately around town as ""The Wild Bunch."" Tom Wilkinson is the high-stakes financier and local mob boss whose territory is being muscled into by a Russian real estate tycoon played by Karel Roden. In addition, Thandie Newton appears as an icy-cool accountant who is risking all by playing both sides off one another; Toby Kebbell shows up as a rock star junkie who amazingly winds up holding most of the key cards in his hand; and Jeremy Piven rounds out the cast as one of a pair of record producers who gets dragged into the whole bloody business against his better judgment. First-rate performances all.We're told that ""RocknRoller"" is only the first entry in what is intended to be a crime drama trilogy. If that's the case, we await with baited breath the next two installments.",RocknRolla

26,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"Not quite at the top of Ritchie's form, but not awful either",7,9 September 2008,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Gangster Lenny Cole (Tom Wilkinson) has his fingers in a lot of pies, including that of the property market. He uses his muscle to cut through red tape and grant planning permission to whoever he wants to give it to. When a Russian businessman asks him to arrange it so he can build a new super football stadium, he sorts it so seven million euros are transported to him, as well as giving him a prized painting as a gesture of goodwill. However, a rival has got wind of this and sends seductress Stella (Thandie Newton) to lure petty criminal One Two (Gerad Butler) into stealing both the cash and the painting. This, of course, sets in motion a deadly chain of events that threaten to reveal the identity of a 'super grass' who's been ratting on villains for years, as well as the inexplicable involvement of apparently dead rock star Johnny Quid (Toby Kebbell.) Ten years ago, it seems unbelievable that Guy Ritchie had no idea his film Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels would give his name an unforgettable cult status, and bring him tremendous success, including another prize gem two years later in the shape of Snatch and that, most unfathomably of all, he would be married to the world's biggest female pop singer. In the heat of all this going on around him, he must have felt like the world was his oyster and that nothing could go wrong. Enter misguided husband/wife, director/star disaster Swept Away and poorly received gangster outing Revolver. The higher you climb, the harder you fall, indeed. And so, RocknRolla was released to the mercy of critics who could very well have dismissed it even before hand as a desperate cry for help from a former great. The truth is, while not at the greatness of Lock, Stock or Snatch, this is a perfectly reasonable piece that shows Mr Ritchie still has a passion and flair for his genre, as well as a style and delivery that's all his own.This is a slick, flashy piece that manages to avoid being style over substance. There is an intricate, multi-layered plot to keep you hooked, as well as an already lively cast livened up even more by support, including the likes of Geoff Bell, Roland Manookian and Idris Alba. Sadly, the narrative flow falters towards the end, and it becomes a little wearisome and boring.This is still a fairly accomplished piece from a director and stars with flair for the genre of film they're making. Far from Ritchie's best work, but I'm sure it's not his worst either. ***",RocknRolla
27,bowmanblue,That other Guy Ritchie film,8,14 February 2016,"We all know 'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels' as the film that practically reinvented the modern day British crime thriller (not to mention launch a certain Mr Ritchie's career) and then 'Snatch' as the sort-of follow up starring Brad Pitt which was a kind of compendium piece to Lock, Stock. Then Guy Ritchie's name got attached to a singer and things didn't go so well for a while. Then came 'Rocknrolla' – which everyone (especially Guy Ritchie) made clear was not just a return to form, but a return to his gangster roots.It's about yet another gang of mockney London scoundrels who fall foul to yet another London kingpin gangster and have to come up with yet another crafty plan to come up with the cash and save their own skins in the process. Yes, it's basically the same plot as Lock, Stock and Snatch. That should be a drawback, but it's still fun.I think if you compare Rocknrolla to Lock, Stock and Snatch you may be a little disappointed, as it's not quite as uber-cool as either of them. However, if you compare it to the plethora of other imitation Guy Ritchie British gangster films, you'll realise it's actually pretty good. Or at least definitely watchable if you're a fan of the genre.I would say that Gerard Butler is the star, but he doesn't seem to be in it enough to be classed as the 'definite' star. I know Ritchie's films are famous for their use of multiple characters and story lines all crossing over and finally coming together, but Rocknrolla seems to have one or two too many stars in it. The cast is indeed impressive and almost every 'hood' is recognisable, but that just means that not all of them are fully developed as characters – Idris Elba, Geoff Bell and Thandie Newton in particular. In fact, it's really Mark Strong (who is basically doing a 'Vinnie Jones' kind of role, only slightly more expanded) who holds it all together and steals every scene he's in.But, don't let that minor gripe put you off. If you like your gangster films, or enjoy Ritchie's (gangster) work, you should find this pretty pleasing. I hear that it was meant to be the first film in the start of a trilogy (eight years on and we're still waiting for part 2!). Perhaps that's why there were so many characters in it? Maybe those who didn't get enough screen time here would have had more to do in the subsequent sequels? No matter I guess – still a fun little ensemble piece.",RocknRolla
28,MLDinTN,an interesting British gangster film,6,24 August 2009,"This movie is similar to other British gangster movies, except it's missing Jason Statom. I always find these sort of double crossing films entertaining. Lenny, the head guy, is doing a business deal with a rich Russian. The Russian is going to give him 7 million so he can get plans approved to build. The Russian tells his accountant, Stella, to get the money together. What he doesn't know is she has grown tired of the safe life and she tells 3 thugs whom owe Lenny money about the money pick up so they can steal it. Also Lenny's rocker stepson breaks in and steals a lucky painting that is owned by the Russian. So, Lenny's tracking the painting that gets passed around. Also, Stella steals from her boss twice when he sets up another money drop off.And at the end we find out whom the informer is that kept sending all the low level gangsters to prison. It's a little bit funny and has some silly action, like the second time One Two steals the money; they are chased by the big Russian guys that just seem to keep getting up.FINAL VERDICT: Another pretty good Guy Ritchie film.

32,TheMovieDiorama,RocknRolla has the hard exterior of a rock but rarely flowingly rolls.,6,29 April 2019,"Guy Ritchie, after a batch of terrible films, sits in his slickly greased up metallic director's chair, hard as nails, and activates ""Full Ritchie Mode"". This British gangster flick feels more Ritchie than Guy himself. More cockney than a cock's knee. And more ""poof"" than a rainbow coloured feathered pillow. He pretty much crammed every trope he adores using into two hours, and for the most part, works pretty well. It's just pleasing and satisfying seeing him back in his comfort zone, even if this is no 'Snatch' or 'Lock Stock'. A kingpin of London makes a deal with a Russian businessman, when said ""whiskey is the new vodka"" millionaire loans out his favourite painting. It gets stolen, everyone's enraged, an informant has yet to be discovered, money is being stolen, and other stuff happens.Right, so the ""plot"" isn't exactly the Crown Jewels, but more on that later. What immediately slots into this convoluted mechanism is the script. It's bangin'. Tastier than a steak and kidney Pukka pie. Lap that dialogue up, because it's deliciously juicy. Harsh, brutal and jam-packed with British slang. From the viewpoints on immigrants to an over-extended gag on ""flowers"", and by that I mean us homosexuals. Whilst the latter could've been better handled, particularly during a ""coming out"" scene, there is plenty of dark humour to be found in the screenplay. Many repeatable quotes, I'm sure.The majority of characters are streamlined and pretty forgettable, mostly due to the average performances. However, Wilkinson, Strong and Kebbel were just exceptional and took centre stage. Strong in particular balances that menacing demeanour with smart comedic execution. So, back to the story. To put it simply, it's all over the place. An unfocused compilation of sub-plots that are discarded by the third act. Ritchie's intentions are well produced, yet the overall execution teeters between overambitious and obnoxious. Either way, it's never fully formed which is a dire shame. Had it been well rounded, this may have matched his previous gangster flicks.",RocknRolla
33,insomniac_rod,"Groovy, fast paced, and witty gangster film.",8,5 September 2010,"Rocknrolla rocked me big time. I fall for everything that has to do with mafias and organized crime.

Mafias are no longer exclusive for narcotics, it also deals with business men, bets, clothing, art, etc.The events are fast paced and told through the eyes of two local robbers that are part of a quite peculiar group.There's plenty of action but what I think is the best feature is Guy Ritchie's narrative. You never lose interest in the situations because every single scene is well directed and ambiented.The dialogs are cool, the characters are badass, the women are insanely hot, and the events are connected in such a way that you can't help but feel ""groovy"".I'm waiting for a sequel!",RocknRolla

The story is too complicated, just for the sake of being complicated.All bad? No, there is some good. Some of the actors are great:Tom Wilkinson, being one of them, but he is the exception to the rule, because most of the actors are simply cardboard characters, boring copies of characters in earlier (better) movies Guy Richie made. This movie definitely was the beginning of the end for the (very shortly) fashionable ex-husband of Madonna, whom he was divorcing from, while making this terrible movie.What's the story about?

35,jzappa,"RocknRolla Is About Men, Young, Dumb, Full of Come, Loaded for Bear, Big and Brutish, Lithe and Agile, Tough and Weak, Dead or Alive.",9,11 November 2008,"Fellas, it's a Warner Bros. gangster film with rock-scored beatings, foot chases and gun play, exploding cars, informants, getting hit with baseball bats, shirtless men with guns, sophisticated muggings, throwaway slapstick gags, nightclubs, faked deaths, a child with a gun,bags over guys' heads, an almost comical lack of emotion on anyone's part, a seductive double-dealing businesswoman, and art theft. Tom Wilkinson hams it up as a slimy crime boss. Its pivotal character, for whose vendetta we root, is a crackhead rock star, the step-son of the mob. There is the prospect of a trilogy. I now ask any teenage guy reading this, ones who've seen it and ones who've not: Do you love this movie? Of course you do.What essentially is RocknRolla about? It's not about gangsters. It's not about the music industry. It's not about revenge, money or real estate, all of which play a role in Guy Ritchie's signature multi-strand clockwork plot. RocknRolla is about men, young, dumb, full of come, loaded for bear, big and brutish, lithe and agile, tough and weak, dead or alive. Why else would Ritchie include such a dose of screen time concerning one of hired crook Gerard Butler's close friend being gay? Butler overreacts, undergoes homosexual panic, realizes everyone else but him knows, endures a slow dance with his gay pal to console him on a bad night, and eventually benefits from his being into guys because he seduces a gay lawyer to gain the identity of an informant. If you are gay, you probably won't be offended. Really, it's just a bunch of guys, clearly obsessed with their masculinity, accepting their friend for who he is by exchanging gay jokes and wisecracks with each other. This gay character is no less masculine than the rest of these quintessential cocksmen, as he is part of the ""Wild Bunch,"" Butler's crew of thieves.Can we safely call Guy Ritchie a one-trick pony at this point? Yes. By and large, he fundamentally makes one movie, and when he tried to make another kind of movie, he and his fans suffered great anguish and submerged the memory. But for those of us who had the privilege of seeing his wickedly disdained previous movie, Revolver, considering Ritchie's range, he is making a much different movie this time around. Revolver is an outlandishly intricate brain-buster so vast in its depth and detail that it is difficult to get one's entire mind around it. RocknRolla is a celebration of the penis, testicles and chest hair. That's it.My favorite character I've already mentioned, a crackhead mob-raised rock star named Johnny Quid, played by the interesting Toby Kebbell. When I say he's my favorite character, I don't mean that he has many dimensions, or I identify with him. Each of the twenty or thirty main characters is about as deep as what face value suggests. He just so happens to have the most interesting face value of them all. Guy Ritchie's penchant for superficial screen writing is back with a vengeance, having even less to say than he did with his first two gangster pictures. What carries the film is its stylistic charisma, which is the aspect of his movies that grows and grows.Thandie Newton's character, essentially the only woman in the film, is a sexy seductress, married for convenience, opportunistically playing both ends and having sex with Gerard Butler, a hilarious piece of editing by the way, for no apparent reason. This is how women are normally used in films like this, even high-brow gangster films by Scorsese or Coppolla. Pertaining to those two filmmakers, one could easily argue that their films about the mob are realistic accounts of the environment and historical hierarchy of organized crime, and that women are objectified in that world. Guy Ritchie has no interest in depicting a realistic underworld. He never has. At one point, for instance, two Russian war criminals dance around a room in their underwear sharpening knives and blaring rock music in ritualistic anticipation for their butchering of a character. So why objectify the only female character? Because this film has an unapologetically obvious target audience: Horny, testosterone- driven heterosexual teenage guys.Perhaps as I grow past the age of 20, I will be less and less enthralled in movies like RocknRolla, but for now, I accept no guilt in enjoying its shameless fantasy world of dick- swinging, black-suited, heat-packing street guys.",RocknRolla
36,Turfseer,Interesting black comedy with a convoluted plot,5,20 November 2008,"After getting sick after attending too many touchy-feely Kaballah sessions (force-fed to him by his now ex-wife, Madonna), Guy Ritchie has returned to his roots with another look at the London Underworld in 'Rocknrolla.' I have not seen his two earlier efforts, 'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels' and 'Snatch' but having read some of the reviews of this film, I'm told that Rocknrolla is very similar to those prior efforts. Rocknrolla is not at all like 'The Sopranos' since none of the characters are at all sympathetic. In the Sopranos, the characters are charming but are always in denial about their lack of morality. There is always the strong presence of law enforcement which forces the Sopranos' characters to always look over their shoulders. In Rocknrolla there is no such counterweight. When we do see the police in Rocknrolla we see them only briefly and they're the equivalent of Keystone Cops.Rocknrolla depicts a contained universe of low-life criminals who take turns at double-crossing one another. Ritchie is not looking to sketch multi-dimensional character portraits as we see in The Sopranos, but rather focus on certain farcical 'types'. Some of the farce is extremely broadfor example two Russian hired assassins who dress up in sado-masochistic outfits and play sado-masochistic games with their tied-up victim but choose not to finish him off right away. The joke is in the way they get sidetracked (that psychopathic killers might also be effeminate) but it's not funny. Similarly, the film's protagonist ""One-Two"" (played by Gerard Butler) is upset with 'Handsome Bob', a member of his gang, when he reveals that he's gay. But instead of beating him up, he calms down, becomes wholly sympathetic and then offers to have sex with him (to show that he is an 'understanding' fellow). In another context (such as Robert DeNiro showing his 'sensitive side' as a mobster spilling his guts out to his shrink in 'Analyze This') the reversal of a 'sensitive' mobster happens to work. But here, the reversal has no panache.Rocknrolla is very difficult to follow due to the East End accents and an extremely convoluted plot. Tom Wilkinson as Lenny Cole, the real estate crime boss, is probably the most believable of all the criminals depicted in this film (the only scene focusing on Lenny I really had trouble with is when the Russian boss has his henchman cripple Lenny on the golf course; how could Lenny have been lured into a situation where he had no protection?).Of what I could understand of the plot, One-two (leader of a gang) borrows money from Lenny to buy some property but is unable to pay him back. Meanwhile, the Russian crime boss agrees to pay Lenny 7 million Euros to bribe public officials so that he can build a new sports stadium in London. As collateral, the Russian gives Lenny an expensive painting which is very dear to him which Lenny will hold until the deal is complete (it's hard to understand why the Russian would want to part with the painting as it has so much sentimental value to him). The Russian's accountant (Stella, played by a sexy Thandie Newton) hires One-Two and his gang who steals her boss's 7 million which he is going to pay to Lenny. One-Two then uses some of that money to satisfy his debt to Lenny. Finally, Lenny's rock-star stepson (who reportedly is missing and presumed a suicide) steals the painting and Lenny sends his right-hand man, Archie along with One-Two to find the painting and get it back to him before the Russian blows his stack. While most of the characters are neither sympathetic, funny or that involving, what I do like about the film is that Ritchie keeps things moving at a frenetic pace with excellent acting, editing and cinematography. By the time the movie is over, you'll be ready to watch it again to figure out exactly what happened. Despite the flawed script, Rocknrolla still has enough interesting things in it to keep your interest. Rocknrolla can best be termed a 'black comedy'. Its main weakness is that it's not all that funny; its strength lies in its light-hearted atmosphereit doesn't take itself that seriously, despite the deep level of violence that permeates the film.",RocknRolla
37,freemantle_uk,An Improvement from Guy Ritchie,7,5 September 2008,"After making Swepted Away and Revolver Guy Ritchie's career hit the rocks and his reputation ruined. Luckily for him he returned to what he was best at and took a back to basic approach.The film is a gangster story set in London. It tells of One-Two (Gerald Butler), who has a small crew, Mumbles (Idris Elba) and Handsome Bob (Tom Hardy). One-Two at the beginning of the film and ends up entering into a dodgy property deal where he owns money to Lenny (Tom Wilkingson), a major London gangster. Lenny basically tricks One-Two so that he could get the property and bribe the London council to let him build up the property and take all the profits. Lenny seeks to make a major deal with a Russian billionaire who owns a football club (I wonder who he is meant to be based on). The billionaire seeks to make a new concert hall very quickly, and wants to use Lenny's contacts to make sure that planning permission is granted. Lenny wants 7 Million Euros so he can do it. The billionaire has a dodgy accountant Stella (Thandie Newton), who asks One-Two to rob the Euros and takes a nice slice of the profits. At the same time the Russian also loans Lenny his lucky painting as a symbol of truth and as a thank you. Unforuately this painting is stolen by Lenny's rock star step-son Johnny Quid (Toby Kebbell). As the film goes on all these story lines become interlinked.Ritchie goes back to the types of films that made his name, which shows that he is really a one trick pony. This film felt a little be like a best of Ritchie. I felt that some of the sub-plot felt a bit tacked on, especially the part involving Johnny Quid and at times characters completely disappeared. The problem with Guy Ritchie is he thinks he is smarter then he really is and wants to be clever with his script. But at least for Ritchie he is in safe territory. Another problem is Ritchie is a mockney, a wannabe cockney, the kind of person most people look down on. However, there are positives. Most of the story does work, and some of the comedy is good. Fans of the original two Guy Ritchie film will love it for that. There is also a very good cast in the film. Tom Wilkington was the best as Lenny, the leading gangster, but most of the other actors gave very good performances. Butler and Newton are a very good actors. There were also fine set-pieces, especially the second raid against the Russians, and has a good comical fight in a sports shop. But at time it did feel like Ritchie took a style over substances approach. There is also an excellent soundtrack to the film, which is never a bad thing. If you are a rock fan you would enjoy it.I personally feel that Ritchie could have cut some times from the plot and it would have made a better film. But there are good performances, and some fun bits and if you are a Guy Ritchie film would will enjoy this flick. A decent attempt.",RocknRolla
38,jimbo-53-186511,Given its credentials this should have been a lot better (minor spoilers),3,2 April 2016,"I'll give Guy Ritchie some credit and I'm prepared to accept that this is certainly a handsome and stylish looking film, and, to an extent is also fairly well put together. However, that's probably about the best I can say for it to be honest...The set-up for the story opens with promise and as expected we're bearing witness to a twisting, turning narrative complete with one or two surprises to follow later in the film. Despite the promising set-up though it's actually surprising how uninvolving this film is as a whole. Essentially it's a rather humourless tale complete with rather shallow characters who share little rapport or chemistry. I think a combination of flat characterisation and a pedestrian script are perhaps the biggest contributors to this film being a bit of a snore-fest. Whilst Ritchie weaves all the strands of the story together well he does occasionally get side-tracked with pointless and dumb plot elements (such as the two junkies flogging items and Tom Hardy's character being gay). The slapping scene is another example of a moderately amusing gag being stretched rather thin and again seemed to add unnecessary running time to the picture. I couldn't help but feel that this is another 90 minute film that's been painfully stretched to nearly 120 minutes which perhaps explains why I found large parts of the film to be rather boring.Looking at RockNRolla in 2016 it's interesting to see the likes of Tom Hardy and Idris Elba before they hit the big time and whilst Tom Hardy was actually very good here sadly Idris Elba didn't make the same impact - although I'd put more of the blame on Guy Ritchie for underusing Elba and giving him nothing to do. Tom Wilkinson is good fun as mob boss Lenny Cole but he gives a rather hammy performance which wears thin and stops becoming fun by the time we reach the second half of the picture. Mark Strong is solid as Cole's loyal right-hand man and Toby Kebbell is also amusing here but isn't really given enough screen time to make the necessary impact.Having enjoyed both Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and Snatch I did have high hopes for RockNRolla and expected more of the same, and whilst Guy Ritchie admirably weaves all the strands of the story together well he does it all in a rather humourless and dull manner making this film something of a yawner.",RocknRolla
39,juneebuggy,Seen it all before but it was still a fun ride,6,28 October 2014,"This was pretty good, nothing new here but if you're your a fan of Guy Ritchie than you'll like it. Pretty standard fare from him; British gangster oriented, crime and thugs and mobsters and pretty woman, intriguing characters, dark comedy, colorful and (hilarious) language and crazy situations with initially confusing story lines that eventually all merge together.I've seen it all before with different characters but it was still a fun ride. Interesting to see Gerard Butler playing a bi-curious, unsuccessful criminal in a B-role. Great cast as always. Enjoyed the battle with the ""Wild Bunch"" and the Russians who just wouldn't go down. What are these guys made of? Hilarious. Disliked the inclusion of Ludicrous and Jeremy Piven even if they just had cameos. 3/27/14",RocknRolla
40,NateWatchesCoolMovies,Wickedly funny romp,8,18 July 2016,"Guy Ritchie's Rocknrolla was the third British crime comedy caper for the director, and it could have easily been the misstep that signaled him wearing out his welcome. Happily I can tell you that it's a winner, and although not as cracking as Lock Stock or Snatch, it sinks into its own distinct groove that's fairly removed from it's two predecessors. Once again we are treated to the life and times of a bunch of hoods and gangsters in London, but not the grungy, back alley soup kitchen London that we're used to from Ritchie. No, this is a glistening, prosperous London, filled with real estate money ripe for the taking and developers making underhanded deals with shady businessmen. The climate has definitely changed in Ritchie's aesthetic, but the characters remain the same, just as witty, eccentric and chock full of pissss and vinegar. The story centers around the wild bunch, a cozy little clan of East end petty thieves led by One Two (Gerard Butler) and Mumbles (Idris Elba). Their third musketeer is Handsome Bob, played by a hilarious Tom Hardy who has a secret up his sleeve that spills out in what is the most adorable scene Ritchie has ever written. The gang is hired by a mysterious chick (Thandie Newton) to rob some dudes, and that's where the trouble starts. Elsewhere in town, arch gangster Lenny Cole (a frothing Tom Wilkinson) negotiates a land deal with dangerous Russian billionaire Uri (Karel Roden switches up his trademark psychosis for smooth talking menace here) that hinges on a missing painting. Lenny dispatches his right hand bloke Archie (Mark Strong, subtly trolling us) to find it along with his rock star nephew Johnny Quid. Got that? Nevermind, half the fun is the how and not the why of Ritchie's stories, and I find it best to just let the flow of it wash over you as opposed to thinking out each detail and missing the sideshow. Toby Kebbell is off the hook as Quid, a wiry stick of dynamite and a comic force to be reckoned with, truly the most exciting performance of the film. Ritchie has a knack for bringing out the funny side in actors, even ones that aren't usually the type to make you laugh. Strong is terrific, with a few carefully timed moments of sheer hilarity that deftly make you forget how dangerous he is. Ludicrous and Jeremy Piven are fun, if a bit out of place as two event promoters. Butler and Elba have an easy-peasy rapport that's light, friendly and believable. Wilkinson dances between alpha assuredness and aging buffoonry nicely, always commanding the scene and oddly reminding me of Mr. Magoo. There's a playful tone to this one, glitzy and celebratory in places where Snatch was grim and sketchy, and the whole affair feels like a new years party with a bunch of old friends. Watch for cameos from Matt King, Nonzo Anonzie, Jimi Mistry, Mundungus Fletcher and Gemma Arterton. Very fun stuff.",RocknRolla

42,rooprect,Imagine all the rejects from the Geico Lizard tryouts arguing about Pink Floyd lyrics,3,16 March 2019,"The first 60 minutes of this film can be summarized as follows: a bunch of stuff goes missing and a bunch of tough guys with cockney accents run around trying to act cool and/or funny.This is the kind of film that plays out like a huge inside joke with no payoff. There are far too many unnecessary characters, too many unnecessary sub-plots, and (this is what makes it unwatchable) NO central character and NO central plot. In that respect, it's a lot like an artsy French New Wave film except that there's nothing artsy about it (just a lot of tacky MTV type edits and oversaturated, overexposed shots with fast motion quickly shifting to slow motion and back again, as if, in lieu of going to film school, the editor watched half of The Matrix and called it a day.That's not even a joke, since director Guy Ritchie's imdb bio states that he dropped out of film school, complaining that ""the work of film school graduates was boring and unwatchable"". So I suppose he figured cinema needed more snappy, overstylized, ADD editing. And yet it still proves to be more boring and unwatchable than Godard at half speed.""Rocknrolla"" tries very hard to be ""Pulp Fiction"", right down to copying Uma Thurman's dance moves and Travolta & Jackson's wacky banter whilst they're killing people, except here the banter isn't wacky or even interesting, and nobody's doing anything except driving around, walking around and setting up meetings in weird places like baseball fields and art museums. ""Pulp Fiction"" worked because it juxtaposed mundane banter over a hypercharged suspense story. But here we just have the mundane banter part juxtaposed over ...nothing really.Three stars just because I unconsciously chortled at one gag. When a painting goes missing from its spot on the wall, a dumb henchman asks ""Where was it?"" Unfortunately they drag that 1 gag out a little too long, much like the entire film.",RocknRolla

45,Enchorde,Good... but not another Snatch,7,15 August 2009,"Recap: Archy is the right hand of Lenny, who is the guy behind the scenes in London, which Lenny calls ""his city"". Now, Uri, a wealthy Russian from, well let's say questionable origin, is set to build an arena on land where it is forbidden to build. So he goes to Lenny, promises Lenny money to grease the city council and lends him his lucky painting. However, the money gets stolen by two local gangsters One Two and Mumbles, who in turn own Lenny a huge amount of money. And suddenly the painting is missing too Comments: A movie from Guy Ritchie, and he has learnt not to change a winning concept. Rock'n'rolla is clearly in the same spirit as Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and Snatch, and it is somewhat impossible not to compare the three. Rock'n'rolla which I found both funny and entertaining, a very good movie, doesn't quite reach the same heights as the two previous movies.First off it is something with the pace. The plot is set for confusion and complexity but rather unexplainable Ritchie seems to want to slow down the movies pace just when it gears up. The central piece, the painting, could have changed hands much more often, creating a much more complex, fast paced and confusingly funny movie. But it stops up with one character and almost interrupts the whole story. Still has some really funny moments, but I sense a little more could have been squeezed out of this story, which has great potential.Second off, while the characters are odd, they are not so extremely unique as those who you find in the other two. Sure, you got some odd fellows. But nothing like Brad Pitt's character in Snatch or Vinnie Jones' in Lock Stock. There are two Russians with potential, but they are unfortunately not allowed very much screen time. Archy, the almost narrator, One Two and Mumbles could almost be described as bland or normal, and they do not force the issue (drive up the pace) as others did. There are a few good characters in there, and the others are not bad either, not at all, don't get me wrong. But they doesn't stand out as I almost expected some should.And third, the ending. And here we have some real spoiler alert. But let's say that the ending is very quick and cheap with the details, whereas the other parts of the movie has been very nice to explain everything, often with flashbacks. Rock'n'rolla, in real Bond-spirit, does promise to return though, and a sequel could both explain and develop with this material. I hope a sequel comes and look forward to it, Rock'n'rolla was promising enough to recommend it. But for Rock'n'rolla only, it felt like a lot had been left out. I almost felt cheated out of the ending, not a particular good feeling to leave your audience with.Still, as mentioned above. An original idea, again, from Ritchie and an entertaining action comedy.7/10",RocknRolla
46,adamjohns-42575,What happened after their slow dance?,5,18 August 2020,"Although he is in a supporting role, I feel that my favourite Tom (Handsome Bob) somewhat upstages my favourite Gerrard (1-2), he is just so cute in his role, although Mr Butler's reactions to him are brilliant and the stuff of far too many men I've met.
In all, the acting is superb in this film and it contains my favourite Idris (Mumbles) and my favourite Mark (Archy) too.It's not Director Guy's best work and doesn't really compare to ""Snatch"" although it has a similar story of robbing Peter to pay Paul to pay Peter, but it gets by on its small humorous moments. It may be that it contains too many characters which results in things getting a bit cloudy, but it would seem that there was supposed to be a sequel that might perhaps have cleared things up a little. It was just missing that ""Certain Something"" that for me made Snatch so much more entertaining and bear in mind that neither would be my first choice of films to watch, but I would be happy to watch it again in the future, once I've exhausted all the sci-fi's and romances, even if it's just to ogle Mr Hardy once more.",RocknRolla

They must repay a huge debt and are helped by Stella, a snob accountant with a taste for low life.The trio steals money from Russian mob boss Uri, who's in business with Lenny. Enter the picture a painting that Uri considers as his talisman and for no good reasons he lends to Lenny. This painting gets stolen by Lenny's stepson, the junkie singer Johnny.A series of implausible events ensues, but everything will be wrapped up nicely by Archy, Lenny's enigmatic second in command. Expect rapidly fired dialogue, that tries very hard (but fail) to copy Tarantino, fast-cut action scenes, a totally irrelevant female presence (the insipid Newton, failing to convey femme fatale as Stella) and a MacGuffin in the shape of the painting we never get to see (how predictable and irritating) but everybody wants to own.Young, male audience (especially the British) will be predictably enthralled and exhilarated by this mediocre tale.

48,valleyjohn,Not up to Ritchie's usual standards,5,11 April 2021,"You won't get a bigger fan of Guy Ritchie than me , especially his gangster movies . Lock Stock and Snatch are two of my favourite films of all time but I don't think it's a coincidence that after RocknRolla he didn't make another of this genre for eleven more years because , to be honest - this isn't very good at all.When a Russian mobster orchestrates a crooked land deal, millions of dollars are up for grabs, drawing in the entire London underworld into a feeding frenzy at a time when the old criminal regime is losing turf to a wealthy foreign mob.The cast is amazing . Tom Hardy , Tom Wilkinson, Gerard Butler , Idris Elba etc.. so why didn't this film work for me ?Firstly , the story is dull . The theme about Johnny Quid makes no sense and Toby Kebbell isn't charasmatic enough for the part and I lost interest in what was happening with the painting .Secondly it's lacks menace . You don't fear for anyone even though Lenny Cole is obviously a nutter and you don't really care to be honest.Thirdly and most importantly , it's missing that Guy Ritchie humour he's so famous for and because it's not funny it comes across as slightly homophobic and racist and I know that's not what he meant .I was really disappointed with this and totally bored which is not a description you can normally give a Ritchie film .Thankfully eleven years later he came back to form with The Gentleman and I really do hope we see more of the same ( not RocknRolla) from one of my favourite directors.",RocknRolla

50,RainDogJr,"""My daddy was a bankrobber but he never hurt nobody, he just loved to live that way and he loved to steal your money""",8,10 January 2009,"2008 was going to be a year in which two Guy Ritchie films had a theatrical release in Mexico well at least in Mexico City since the 2005 film Revolver was just released last November and this film, RocknRolla, was supposedly going to be released on 19 December 2008 however it was just released yesterday and yesterday I saw it. I do saw Revolver on the big screen last December and if never wrote a comment for it is just because two simple facts: a) I arrived when the film had already started and b) I slept during some parts. Then with the parts that I saw (most of the film) I can say it is a basic film that wants to be deep but only gets to be a messy one, certainly I disliked a lot what I saw of Revolver, what was Ritchie thinking? But anyway, Snatch is definitely a personal favourite, one of those pictures that every time is on I watch it until the very last scene. The first Snatch, for a way to call LS&TSB, is also a film that I had enjoyed many times and I don't mind giving those two films a 10 out of 10 as I don't mind watching more of the same, nothing new but after all Snatch was nothing new but still I love it. So RocknRolla has the same things, we have our main characters but we will have more and more. We meet Lenny Cole (Tom Wilkinson) and Uri Obamavich (Karel Roden) and the wild bunch, is simply as that would be better for some of them to know where does certain money came from and stuff. Here a painting is what the old shotguns were in Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels so that means that we know what that painting means for certain persons and also that the painting will be in many hands, in hands of people that just know the obvious, that just know that it is a f****** painting. This painting will take us with the RocknRolla, mostly he is now a f****** annoying junkie, he will be certainly important, he took the painting. At one point the painting will be in the hands of a woman, a sexy woman (played by Thandie Newton) who will be the love interest of two guys including the real owner of that damn painting, was his lucky painting and just after he asked her for marriage he will find finally his painting, she will lie, certainly is all over for her. One-Two (Gerard Butler, better known as King Leonidas) and his mates are the Turkish/Tommy of RocknRolla, trying to get money, doing jobs, being in danger and stuff. Archie is a nice character, those die-hard Russians were also terrific, is a very fun picture to watch (""but I mean you're handsome Bob""), nothing great, Snatch is still my favourite Guy Ritchie film and I will be watching part II of RocknRolla wanting to see something great but knowing",RocknRolla
51,p-stepien,Three strikes...,7,30 October 2010,"In this convoluted myriad of dirty deeds it's hard to really present the script. And maybe it's best not to and just let the story build up itself coming into it from the dark.London. Cute English accents. A lot of swearing. Some fights. A lot of the criminal underground. Some audacious gags. Fast talkers. Multiple characters, mostly antiheroes and downright dirty criminals. Bad guys and badder guys. Dirty deeds. Classic Guy Ritchie with a robust script and some great performances.So why didn't it work as well as ""Lock, stock and two smoking barrels"" or ""Snatch""? Maybe the problem was repetitiveness. Not only by Ritchie himself, but also by the fact that a lot of directors for Great Britain and the US have tried to copy the stylish dark comedies he made in the late 90s. Problem is that after a while it's hard to keep ahead of the pack, especially if you just redo what you did last time around. Naturally this is a step up after his total flops ""Swept Away"" and ""Revolver"".Anyway the issue of repetitiveness only scratched my senses for the first 30 minutes, but once I allowed myself to be engulfed by Ritchie's criminal world and thoroughly enjoyed the ride. The script is mostly spot on (although it does seem a bit forced at times, when Ritchie tries to tie in all the loose ends) as is the dialogue (funny, sharp, naughty and... pure ritchie). Definitely directed much better than ""Sherlock Holmes"", but I guess familiar territory allowed Ritchie to let loose. Enough so that it is one of the funnest movies I have watched this year with a certain slow dance being the highlight of the movie.The cast is stellar. Not necessarily the names concerned, but the acting itself. Of special mention should be Gerald Butler, Thandie Newton, Toby Kebbell and Mark Strong. Everyone carries the picture perfectly making it at least a great watch.All in all this movie should serve as a lesson to the director: Never leave England again - you feel the country all too well to waste your time playing make-pretend in Hollywood.",RocknRolla

If this is what Guy Ritchie is capable of, I need to add him to my list of favorite directors immediately. Everything about RocknRolla is so immaculately stylish, only a director with an excellent eye could have pulled off this so well. There have been several movies that have attempted to carry such a captivating style (Domino, Smokin Aces), but I honestly can say that I have never seen it done this well. It's rare for me to see a movie with so many cool and memorable scenes. I don't even think that I could choose a favorite. The dialogue is snappy, the camera work is captivating?it all adds to the film in subtle and not so subtle ways. The occasional violent scene is never over-the-top, gratuitous or extraneous to the plot. I really don't want to describe said plot in my review, because it unfolds in a very interesting way that only serves to make the movie even better. There really aren't any negative qualities worth noting.All the actors and actresses are just outstanding. I?m not even going to mention any single one in particular, because then I would have to say something about all of them. Fifty percent of the film's coolness comes from its actors and dialogue, and the other fifty percent comes from its brilliant music and camera work.

54,dunmore_ego,High Voltage Rock n Roll.,7,15 February 2009,"Another twisty, spanky, kablooey tale from the dirty messiah madman who gave us LOCK, STOCK AND TWO SMOKING BARRELS (1998), Guy Ritchie, about expensive hoods, cheap hoods, indestructible hoods, Russian hoods, and a McGuffin painting that we never see that everyone wants.As with Ritchie's other slambanging movies, describing the plot is a futile exercise, and the intricacies of the interconnecting throughlines is best left to a viewing while drunk on cheap port.But here goes (deep breath): Set in the snarling British real estate underworld where crime lord Lenny (Tom Wilkinson) handshakes a multi-million dollar land deal with Russian Uri (Karel Roden), with intent to scam him, even whilst Uri's own accountant (Thandie Newton) is scamming Uri by setting up robberies of his money transfers, using a gang of small-time hoods known as The Wild Bunch (led by Gerard - ""Spartans! Prepare for glory!"" - Butler), while a painting of Uri's, that he lent to Lenny, goes missing, stolen by Lenny's rock star junkie son, Johnny Quid (Toby Kebbell, ripped like Crucified Jesus), who has faked his own death to boost album sales, Uri dispatching two relentless Russian wardogs to find the painting, find the traitor, find his money, and find the Wild Bunch, who discover they not only have to deal with an informer in their midst, but a homosexual as well...It's definitely another intricately thug-woven Guy Ritchie story - but ROCK N ROLLA lacks the verve of Ritchie's cinematic flamethrowers, SNATCH and LOCK, STOCK. The execution seems like a poor man playing Ritchie. It's him at the wheel, so we can only contend that Ritchie's Madonna years somehow softened his wolverine bite - after all, he did give us SWEPT AWAY.

55,pyrocitor,"Ritchie rolls back into action with a pulse pounding, viciously funny return to form",8,7 September 2008,"In a business as enormously subjective as the film industry, it would seem near impossible to attempt to remain individual and innovative, continually raising the bar, without the occasional stumble. Writer/director Guy Ritchie, who at first garnered countless approval for his vicious, hyper-stylized tales of dirty deeds in the British underground, had found the critical tides turning in recent years after the succession of universally panned Swept Away to widely baffling Revolver, begging the question as to whether Ritchie's cinematic genius had been limited to his initial films. However, fans of the unconventional filmmaker will be enthralled to hear that his latest project, RocknRolla proves a confident return to form, a snappy, stylish piece of work bristling with energy and acerbic wit - in short, classic Ritchie.Returning to his defining genre, Ritchie crafts yet another convoluted myriad of intersecting story lines focusing on greed, deception, double-crossing and plenty of stupidity in the seedy underbelly of England. With viewers trusted to be familiar with his unique style, Ritchie uses his familiar story template to worm in social commentary amidst his trademark edge and humour, satirising the increasingly developed state of London and the enormous demand for real estate and location. But this is not the ordinary, romanticized London, as Ritchie's cinematic eye appears determined to capture every last dank, filthy gutter, every ounce of crime and corruption in a fashion akin to the least flattering cinematic depictions of New York. And yet, amidst the filth and edgy comedy, the occasional moment of raw humanity, flawed as it may be emerges from the fray of unanimously unsympathetic characters, whether it be the vulnerability of rocker Johnny Quid shuddering and rocking back and forth on a drug trip or the witty interplay between 'The Wild Bunch', a trio of hapless thieves. For a film so cynically detached, RocknRolla sure can hit the emotional gut-punch buttons for brief but unsettlingly crucial moments.However, in the midst of his caustic reflection on his home town, Ritchie has mercifully left his sense of uproarious fun intact. After a relatively slow start, serving mostly to set up the convoluted array of characters and plot points (the central Maguffin this time being a 'lucky' Russian painting which goes missing) the film takes off at the frenzied pace those familiar with Ritchie's work would expect. Plunging into a fray of hilarious coincidences and situational comedy (watch for a priceless slow dance scene and one of the most hysterical sex scenes in many a year), double crosses, intimidation rants, philosophical monologues and the time worn Ritchie tradition of indestructible Russian hit men, it becomes clear that no matter how many similarities it may bear to past work, the delight of seeing a dynamic talent back on the top of his game cannot be understated. While the hyper-kinetic editing and camera-work and bold music cues of Snatch have been toned down and the casual violence is more removed, the cinematic flavour is unmistakable - Ritchie is back, and just as bombastically entertaining as ever. As usual, Ritchie's cast rise to the occasion of matching the brilliance of their script and director. Gerard Butler brings an endearing charm to tough talking goofball thug One-Two, inevitably raising laughs whenever on screen and anchoring the film as one of the few likable characters. Tom Wilkinson takes on the role of resident British mobster with considerable aplomb, spitting out his lines with a vindictive joy and proving easily more than adequate on the intimidation front. Thandie Newton evokes an alluring mysterious air as a devious accountant playing each side of the conflict against each other, exuding a subtle quirkiness in her execution of the traditional femme fatale figure. Mark Strong delivers harried menace and perfect comic deadpan as Wilkinson's right hand man, crafting another memorable Ritchie reference with the ""Archie slap"", and Idris Elba and Tom Hardy are fittingly hilarious as One-Two's bumbling fellow hard men Mumbles and Handsome Bob. Finally, Toby Kebbell eerily essays the most commanding character on screen as allegedly deceased rocker Johnny Quid. A narcissistic, painfully vulnerable, haphazardly philosophical and cheekily insulting pile of flaws and potent observations, Quid is as classic as any of Ritchie's more beloved characters, and Kebbell's off-kilter performance rivets the viewer's attention - whether hilarious or tragic, he is always invariably impossible to ignore and far too interesting to discount. While the occasional cry of rehashing story elements from past successes may be raised, Ritchie's return to form is too supremely entertaining to dwindle under such complaints, as the formula proves to have just enough shelf life along with countless inspired tweaks to remain miles ahead of any stylistic impersonators. For any finding the cinema's fare too dull or uninspired, fear not - a genuine talent has re-emerged, and RocknRolla proves just the antidote to the hackneyed mainstream offshoots which slunk up in his absence.

The rest of the film is just a collage of beautifully lit handsome actors talking nonsense, all coordinated by the director who obviously has an eye for his all male cast (that includes the bare-chested waiters during the party scene). There is one sexy woman in it, played by Thandie Newton, but her character is more of an afterthought than anything else certainly compared to the attention the director focused his lens on the male cast. Speaking of lenses, the cinematography/lighting was so glossy it became more harsh than something pleasing to the eye. Everything and I mean everything looked like a glossy magazine spread, which quickly got boring to watch. Not awful by any means, the film's biggest liability is how generic the whole thing was. By the end of the movie, you go ""meh"". If it wasn't for the epic chase scene and the interesting all male cast I would have forgotten about it hours after seeing it. Slightly better than OCEAN'S 13, which is identical on many aspects.",RocknRolla
57,gianmarcoronconi,Quite entertaining,8,21 July 2021,"Action movies that can entertain. In the middle part, however, this film slows down considerably becoming almost boring and then recovers on the ending.

58,Sirus_the_Virus,"Not Guy Ritchie's best, but still pretty funny.",8,7 October 2009,"I have gotten into Guy Ritchie's films. I saw Snatch for the first time a few months ago, loved it, and had to try his others. Snatch was a brilliant film because it was funny and I understood the plot. I sort of understood the story for Rocknrolla, but for some reason had a hard time following it. The film has a lot of big laughs. Including a chase scene involving Gerard Butler's character. Also, Gerard Butler's character's gay friend, who dances with him. Also, a dancing scene between Butler and Thandie Newton is ridiculously funny.The film has the laughs that Snatch had. But the film's plot I got a bit lost in. I said I got lost in, that's not the films fault it's mine. I was in and out of the room on the computer so it's my fault. I give the film a big thumbs up though. Is it as good as Snatch? No. But I liked it more than Lock, Stock, and two smoking barrels. Like Snatch, the film has laugh out loud moments and all of the characters are funny. I am looking forward to the future Rocknrolla films. Apparently, there are going to be two more. Thumbs up for Rocknrolla, and I hope to see more of Guy Ritchie.Rocknrolla:***1/2 out of ****",RocknRolla
59,Angelus2,Another Guy Ritchie Classic,8,23 January 2009,"This is just like all of Guy's earlier work, its a gangster film that has lots of comedy and plenty of twists.The film focuses on a illegal property deal that is taking place between a British mobster, Lenny and Russian gangster. The Russian billionaire lets Lenny borrow his favourite painting to give him god luck only when Lenny takes it home, its robbed by his step-son. Johnny Quid. Lenny then gives hi second in command the fierce Archie a mission to retrieve the painting before the Russian finds out. Among other things there is a gang known as the Wild Bunch who have struck luck as they find themselves robbing accountants, ironically this money belongs to a certain Russian...he film is genuinely very funny, certain American critics have said it is really bad, and not funny. Well this is British humour, its not slap stick, its dry wit....Loved the bit with the car...forgetting the keys! A great British Gangster comedy...",RocknRolla
60,antoniotierno,entertaining and enough enjoyable,7,11 May 2009,"It's certainly quite a funny film, deserving a decent a good review. With ""Rocknrolla"" Guy Ritchie intends somehow to go back to his origins but to show, at the same time, something of Trainspotting, Martin Scorsese and Quentin Tarantino (both for action sequences and violence). RocknRolla leaves the viewer satisfied, though not wanting more (there will be a sequel for sure). The movie is clever as well as engaging, due to the valid performances from a cast that is at the best (Tom Wilkinson in particular is good). Not a masterpiece of course but a work having style, energy and filled with whizzy visual gags and graphics. Finally it works, given its purposes. I would say it's enough enjoyable, although critics tore it to pieces.",RocknRolla
61,jaredmobarak,Was it a slow dance?  RocknRolla,8,5 November 2008,"Is Guy Ritchie back? Has the impending divorce brought back that violent edge we fans have been missing? I guess it is somewhat idiotic of myself, and others, to dismiss Ritchie as though he's left the playing field. Sure Swept Away couldn't have been good as art let alone for his career, but besides that and what some consider a bloated mess in Revolver, Ritchie hasn't imploded. The guy made two great cockney gangster flicks and with his newest film, RocknRolla, continues the tradition, pulling the train back on its tracks if he ever really derailed at all. I can't stand people saying that he needs to stop writing the same film over and over again  do you like them? Then who cares? If it works, run with it. Ritchie is skilled enough to create nuance to his tales and despite the good ones all pertaining to the seedy workings of the British underworld, they aren't carbon copies of each other. RocknRolla shows a definite maturity in style with some brilliant visual sequences and the action/humor/violence fills the screen at every turn.It is always a pleasure to see the narrator gimmick succeed. The entire story is relayed by Archie, played with gritty toughness by Mark Strongthis guy is everywhere now. He treats us to backstories, flashbacks, and observations on the day-to-day dealings working under London boss Lenny Cole, a volatile Tom Wilkinson, chewing massive amounts of scenery. Strong helps explain the interesting coincidental connections that seem to always occur in the crime world; everyone ends up running into each other at some point. I really believe this one line helped me overlook multiple instances of convenient storyline overlapping, something necessary to be invested in the film. Every criminal on screen will at some point effect the life of the others, whether intentional, unconsciously, or just by sheer dumb luck. In this way, it all becomes a cohesive whole despite the jumping between character point of views and instances in time. Ritchie seems to have carefully orchestrated it all, uncovering every little detail at just the right moment to the audience, no matter if it occurred before or after what precedes it. We're shown it all in an order that bolsters the narrative, not necessarily the chronological timeline of those involved.In that respect, certain characters are brought in and out of the story, showing up to enter our consciousness, but held back until we truly need them. It all begins with the junkie binge of rockstar Johnny Quid, a punk kid at once thought to just be a random slacker until his history is slowly peeled back. Toby Kebbell is a true RocknRolla, living the life of drugs, sex, violence, and anything else he can dip his foot in. My favorite character, by far, Johnny Quid meanders through the lives of everyone else as the one connection common to all. The pithiest junkie I've ever seen, the nuggets of wisdom he relates to his pal Pedro are astounding and unpredictable. A screw-up that was raised with every opportunity to wealth is purposely sending his life to the gutter, making his psychobabble and cigarette metaphors that much more entertaining, because he spouts the intellect in a completely cynical, sarcastic manner. The kid is too smart for his own good and we all know his mouth will inevitably get him into trouble  setting up a great elevator monologue towards the end with his ex-agents played nicely by Jeremy Piven and Chris Bridges.It will be tough to explain details of the plot without risk of spoiling the entire thing. So, in a nutshell, it all revolves around property. Wilkinson's mob boss controls the planning committees and anyone else necessary for a large real estate deal to run smoothly. He has put himself into business with his Russian equivalent to build a new stadium in London. This interaction brings into play an expensive ""lucky"" painting that changes hands, two transactions of 7 million Euros intercepted by a ragtag group of lowlifes, and the question of freedom as a commodity being ruined by an unknown informant to the police. Ritchie keeps it all going at a breakneck pace, introducing a new wrinkle just when you think it's about to slow down. Culminating in a final confrontation with everyone bringing forth the truth of who they truly are. I don't see how you cannot be entertained by it all.The cast is stellar throughout. Whether a known or unknown, each adds his own flair to the proceedings, keeping the interest level high. No one really stars; it is a very even-handed ensemble with people coming in and out, doing their thing and stepping back to let everyone else do theirs. Thandie Newton is beautiful and intriguing as a corrupt accountant living a life of convenience, but never happy; Nonso Anozie is really funny as Tank (""Think"" Tank) finding all the nefarious doings on the street; Karel Roden shows again why he reigns supreme with Russian villainy; and Gerard Butler, Idris Elba, and Tom Hardy shine as the Wild Bunch, hired muscle to do everyone's dirty work for them, clueless to the big picture, but having a great time nonetheless. The best part of the film concerns them and the second money heist against a duo of indestructible Russians. Ritchie shoots it very artistically with a hand-held camera, jumping and shaking. The close-ups of faces cropped on the far right side, affixed to the actor as he runs is breathtaking. The humor never goes stale, the absurdity of the situation never trumps the fun factor, and the slowed to a crawl end to the chase due to fatigue is fantasticit has it all, blood, violence, machine guns, physical humor, tempo changes, car crashes, and frenetic editing. This one sequence is the epitome of the film, one that will never leave you bored.",RocknRolla
62,Benjamin-M-Weilert,Half a great movie.,5,19 May 2019,"This movie suffers from an exposition that's far too long and way too many flat characters. I would have given it ten stars if they had started it half-way through, when the audience finally gets to meet the rock-n-rolla. Toby Kebbell is the only interesting actor in this film that obviously shows the marital troubles that Guy Ritchie was going through at the time. Not near enough action early in the movie to keep my attention; and yet, I stuck through it and came to enjoy the second half far more than the first.",RocknRolla
63,cultfilmfan,RocknRolla,10,9 November 2008,"RocknRolla is a new black comedy that also blends part of an action gangster film as well. There is so many different stories going on in this film and with so many characters as well that to write a plot synopsis would be quite difficult and in a way useless, because half of the sheer enjoyment is seeing all this enfolding before you. RocknRolla is a British film and takes place in the UK with a mix of British and American actors. For me there was much to enjoy and appreciate about this movie. First of all, the pace of the film is extremely fast moving and there is literally something going on every moment of this film. Whether you are a fan of such a hyper and bouncing off the walls style, you will at least not be bored. I enjoyed all of the different stories associated with the different characters of the film and some could be quite funny, dark and quite unique and different. The film is also very stylish with it's use of lights, music and atmosphere. There were even a couple of scenes that the way they were set up and handled, I thought they stood well on their own and some were quite frankly speaking, brilliant. I also liked the different uses of atmosphere and sets in the film. Some scenes take place in really rich and luxurious buildings and the next scene we are in a drug addict's apartment where sitting in your theatre seat you literally feel dirty being in there. The acting which ranges from tough guys to tough guys making jokes is all well played by the cast and the acting is actually very good surprisingly and there is not one weak performance in the whole film. The ensemble cast should all be applauded for doing such a good job and each person cast in their role was a great casting choice. The casting director did a great job and everyone looked, felt and played their part to perfection. I think this film stands out from other films this year because of how unique and different it is and even though it is from a major mainstream distributor, I think there will be enough here for art house fans to like as well such as the rich and jolted storytelling to the great style and sometimes brilliant scenes set up from writer/director Guy Ritchie. Not to mention that the script and direction is all very impressive. There is a lot to appreciate in this film on many levels and I personally didn't have any problems with this film at all and I really thoroughly enjoyed myself for the entire film. I was entertained and sometimes in shock and awe of what was in front of me, but in a fascinated type of way and I mean that in the best way possible. RocknRolla is truly a one of a kind film, but works on so many levels, and while it may not be for everyone, I still can see this definitely going down and becoming a hit with certain audiences. One of the most interesting, artistically impressive and overall best films of the year so far.",RocknRolla
64,The_Movie_Cat,Probably Ritchie's most successful movie to date...,7,23 September 2008,"... the lukewarm reviews of RocknRolla probably have less to do with the picture's worth in and of itself, and more to do with the fact that we've seen it at least twice before.Okay, Revolver tried to intellectualise the format and we can forget that terrible film he did with his wife, so RocknRolla is really Lock, Stock... 3. The major difference being the writing and directing are now a bit tighter and less self-conscious, and the acting is better.Some of the guys involved won't win any awards for thesping, but the days when we'd get cameos from ex-professional footballers now seem long gone. Sure, like all of Ritchie's gangster output it's The Long Good Friday for the Shebet Dib Dab generation, but on those terms it works admirably. No classic, but none of Ritchie's work is.... just fun popcorn entertainment that requires little from the audience except to sit and watch.",RocknRolla
65,Ruskington,Too much of a good thing,6,15 July 2020,"Just like Guy Ritchie's previous big hitters, Lock Stock and Snatch, RocknRolla is an amusing fast-paced and stylish film with a stellar cast and a menacing soundtrack.However, it certainly does feel a bit worn out and repetitive. The pacing, plot structure and dialogue are almost identical to the aforementioned predecessors and, as a result, the film is very predictable and struggles to hold your attention at times. Every character, twist and joke has already been done to death and not even this highly impressive cast can elevate it above mediocrity. The cockney wideboy trope has been well and truly flogged and Ritchie really needed to relocate for this latest incarnation.Regardless, RocknRolla is still a perfectly entertaining two hours and if you are a Ritchie virgin you would probably be mesmerised by it.",RocknRolla
66,joebloggscity,Another good bloke-ish British gangster movie; enjoyable...,7,28 November 2008,"Guy Ritchie has been in the news in the UK more for his personal life than for his movies, and his latest (Rock n rolla) has been overlooked by many. Not a bad film by any means, it follows a similar pattern as his previous gangster movies where multiple characters with multiple story lines are threading together with bloke-ish humour, action, violence and confusion to wrap up all tidily enough at the end.Basic story is that of a major UK crimeboss (who denies the tag) looking to seal a major deal with a dodgey Russian oligarch. Add in a gift of a prize painting that goes missing, then stolen bags of $7m, a sexy accountant (Thandie Newton) and you have yourself a story. To complicate things is the junkie rockstar stepson of the UK crimeboss (hence the Rock n Rolla title) and you have your adventure.Many might pan the film, as some seem to do with just anything Guy Ritchie releases, but the truth is that this is a good film. The humour is excellent whilst the ensemble actors are generally quite well picked for their roles. Gerard Butler in particular excels in his role as a minor gangster, whilst Thandie Newton seems to fit in wonderfully in a film you wouldn't expect her to be necessarily suited for (and appears to be having a lot of fun in the bargain).A good soundtrack, some good direction and you have a good film. What lets it all down though is that the storyline can be confusing and can get bogged down too much. For much of the film, you are just waiting and waiting for it all to move on, partly this is due to the multiple story lines slowing it all down.Regardless, its enjoyable enough for the genre. Could have been better, but a good film and if nothing else you'll likely enjoy the humour at least.",RocknRolla
67,deatman9,Ritchies funniest movie!,7,24 November 2012,It seems most of Guy Ritchies movies are very identical and this one compares to Snatch although in my opinion not as good but a hell of a lot funnier.

There is some great characters and writing with a story line that keeps you interested right till the end.This movie is about a crime boss who has a very valuable painting stolen from him. He tries to figure out who stole it and eventually figures out it was his junkie stepson and now he hires some people willing to do whatever it takes to get it back.This movie was great definitely one of my favorite from Guy.

Large real estate scams, rockers with a bad attitude, people being worked into cooperating by doing some nasty things to them. With RocknRolla Guy Ritchie returns to crime comedies played out by criminals from all levels and story lines rolling into each other in the most weird ways imaginable. It is not as good as either Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels or Snatch, but it is a sure improvement over the films he did in the mean time and I hope the ""rebirth"" continues in his next films for those two proved he can make brilliant films.This story rolls by rather quickly, there's a lot of things happening and its next to impossible to not feel any kind of pity for some of the characters and what they have to go through. Most of the players, if not all, are playing their rolls out with flair and lust for the game and that works out rather well.

74,Ali_John_Catterall,Jog On,1,12 November 2009,"In recent years the release of a new Guy Ritchie feature has become a major talking point - for all the wrong reasons. Not so much a launch, more a public flogging. You'd think that after the debacle of Swept Away and Revolver, he'd throw us all a sheepish grin and amble back to the pub. Yet, time and again, he drags his director's chair from the allotment and breezily plonks it down in the middle of the corpse-strewn warzone that is the business of film. At the very least you've got to admire his tenacity. And as he stresses, none of his movies have actually lost money so far. Tom Wilkinson is Lenny Cole, old-style gangster-cum-property developer, with councillors and half of London's skyline in his sky rocket. A tax-dodging seven million euro deal with a new Russian oligarch on the block, the Abramovich-like Uri, is compromised after Lenny loses the ""lucky"" painting Uri has loaned him in a display of good will. The painting, stolen by a couple of Scally junkies, winds up in the hands of Lenny's stepson, crackhead musician Johnny Quid, reported missing at sea, though very much alive and terrorising clubland. Because, clearly, that's what our wimpy, smacked-up, skinny-trousered indie rockers are capable of these days; leaving bouncers for dead. Also in the mix are a trio of stick-up guys dubbed the 'Wild Bunch'. After finding themselves in hock to Cole, the Bunch hatch a plan with Uri's treacherous femme fatale accountant Stella (Newton) to rip off the Russian, acquiring that painting along the way. Then things get messy. This is a Ritchie plot after all, akin to one of those children's puzzles where the finger must follow a number of tangled fishing lines to see if Ernie the Eskimo, Wally the Whaler or Pat the Poacher is having mackerel for supper. One thing you can be sure of: following a number of near-misses, each party will bump into one another at the climax and have a massive fishfight. If this all sounds familiar, it's probably because Ritchie has just re-made Lock Stock And Two Smoking Barrels. Not content with being a magpie's magpie (The Long Good Friday and Pulp Fiction are both reflexively referenced here), he's also started ripping off his own films. Fair enough. Even the dimmest bulb must eventually come round to the fact that, when all else fails, it's prudent to nudge the least mouldiest bit of old fruit to the top of the apple cart. But a decade after Ritchie surfed that frothing zeitgeist, there's an appalling weariness about RocknRolla, a terrible sense of sadness, surely springing from the lesson that trying to bust out of one's own limited remit doesn't always pay off. Unfortunately, the director can now barely remember how he got the right things right in the first place. Yet again, a film jumping with fantastic character actors has been utterly capsized by the script. There are actors here the calibre of Idris Elba - Guy (or his people) have been watching 'The Wire'. And Matt 'Super Hans' King - Guy (or his people) has been watching 'Peep Show'. And not least, the extraordinary Toby Kebbell, here apparently channelling Russell Brand. Against Ritchie's juggernaut of mediocrity they are all powerless to resist. Mark Strong, for instance (in his second Ritchie film after Revolver), has been rewarded for his loyalty with a bigger role as Lenny's enforcer Archie - though simultaneously punished with more dialogue. It is deeply depressing to watch King voice lines like, ""This lot are doing more bugle than a brass section"" and indeed, every utterance sounds like a photo caption from 'Maxim' magazine: ""In there like swimwear""; ""Think before you drink before you drive me mad""; and repeatedly (that new favourite phrase of mockneys everywhere): ""Jog on."" At one point, Uri actually says to Lenny without irony, ""We are very much alike, you and I"", while scintillating exchanges such as ""Reality is a cruel mistress""; ""I must remember that""; ""Be my guest"" are par for the course. Elsewhere, there are some schoolboy giggles at the expense of Uri's enormous semi-naked henchmen, as if the Epic Movie team were remaking David Cronenberg's Eastern Promises; although, keen to emphasize his noughties credentials, Ritchie has Elba saying of a gay Wild Buncher, ""If I could be half the human Bob is, at the price of being a poof, I'd think about it."" Well, it's almost convincing. Yet as an encounter between Butler and the dull, not-especially-fatale Newton demonstrates, Guy's films aren't all that interested in straight sex either.Those under-and-over-cranked cameras may be less in-your-face this time round, but there's no disguising the director's other tics; convoluted plot lines; daft-names; the same old railway arches and tunnels, 'gritty' backdrops for the same tired old chase scenes; those interminable cracker barrel philosophies, like sallies from a depressed barfly: ""There is no spring without a winter. And no life without death."" Or, ""That which starts sweet ends bitter. And that which starts bitter ends sweet."" It's as if Ritchie didn't realise Being There was a satire. Wading through this stuff is akin to peeping through one's fingers at a retired, punch-drunk boxer climbing into the ring, or a recidivist junkie ripping out their naltrexone implants. It is especially traumatic to witness Stringer Bell from 'The Wire' wearing a motorcycle helmet with comedy teddy bear ears. In the run up to the film's release even Ritchie's US distributor, Warners, decided to scale down the film's marketing operation, saying ""It's funny in spots..."" but ""not broadly commercial.""Someone thinks differently; at the end of RocknRolla comes the awful revelation: 'Archie, Johnny and the Wild Bunch will be back in The Real RocknRolla'; the first of two proposed sequels. As Archie muses, ""That's the thing about greed. It's blind. And it doesn't know when to stop.""",RocknRolla
75,rajatdahiyax,Amazing hyperkinetic crime comedy!!!!!!,9,21 August 2014,"In London, the British mob boss Lenny Cole (Tom Wilkinson) rules the growing real estate business using a corrupt Councillor (Jimi Mistry) for the bureaucratic services and his henchman Archy (Mark Strong) for the dirty work. A billionaire Russian businessman, Uri Omovich (Karel Roden), plans a crooked land deal, and London's crooks all want a piece of it. Other key players include the underhand accountant Stella (Thandie Newton) and ambitious small- time crook One-Two (Gerard Butler) leading a group called the ""Wild Bunch"" which includes Mumbles (Idris Elba) and Handsome Bob (Tom Hardy).Lenny charges Uri 7,000,000 for the crooked deal; Uri has his accountant Stella find funds. Uri lends his lucky painting to Lenny as a sign of friendship. Stella, however, double-crosses Uri and tips off the Wild Bunch to steal the money, while the painting is stolen from Lenny's wall by his junkie rocker stepson Johnny Quid (Toby Kebbell), who disappears. Lenny and Archy enlist his managers Mickey (Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges) and Roman (Jeremy Piven) to track down Johnny.After Uri's money is stolen by the Wild Bunch a second time, his assistant Victor begins to suspect that it is Lenny who has been stealing the money and purposely keeping Uri's painting from him to resell it. This theory enrages Uri, who lures Lenny to a private golf game in order to break his leg, warning him to return his painting without delay.Cookie (Matt King) happens to buy the painting from some crackheads who had just stolen it from Johnny's hideout. Cookie then gives the painting to One-Two who, in turn, offers the painting to Stella (after a sexual encounter) as a token of appreciation. After Stella leaves his flat, One-Two is surprised by Uri's henchmen but is rescued, and then kidnapped, by Archy and his goons who had come looking for Uri's money.Uri wants to marry Stella, whom he has long admired. At Stella's house he proposes, but he spots the painting. Stella lies and says she has had it for years. Uri, enraged by this and realizing that Stella betrayed him, orders Victor to kill her.Archy brings Johnny, the Wild Bunch, Mickey, and Roman to Lenny's warehouse, where Johnny provokes his crippled stepfather. Before Johnny can reveal a damning truth about Lenny in front of everyone, Lenny shoots him in the stomach. Lenny then orders Johnny executed. He demands that the Wild Bunch tell him where the money is. Handsome Bob calls out to Archy and offers the documents in his jacket pocket, confirming what Johnny had been about to reveal: that the ""rat"" in the ranks, codenamed ""Sidney Shaw"", was Lenny all along. Lenny arranged with the police to routinely throw many of his associates in prison for years at a time in order to secure his own freedom and sow fear among his gang. One-Two, Mumbles, and even Archy were among the people Lenny has ratted on over the years. Archy orders Lenny's men to free the Wild Bunch and has Lenny executed by drowning.In the lift on their way to their deaths, Johnny graphically explains to Mickey and Roman that they will be executed, and the manner of their executions. His description unnerves the man who's to execute the three men, prompting him to make a move prematurely. Having also already anticipated this move, Johnny warns Mickey and Roman to intervene and kill their would-be executioner. Johnny shoots two more men waiting at the top of the lift. They overcome the last of the gangsters (with the help of the Wild Bunch) and escape.Later, Archy picks up Johnny from rehab. Archy gives the painting to Johnny as a peace offering. Archy reveals to Johnny that obtaining the painting ""cost a very wealthy Russian an arm and a leg"". Johnny proclaims that, with his new-found freedom from addiction and his father, he will do what he could not before: ""become a real RocknRolla"".",RocknRolla

77,diac228,"Slick on style, thick on dialogue, but so thin on action.",6,6 November 2008,"Ever see a movie that barks so much you are ready for the major biteonly for it not to be delivered? That's RocknRolla in a nutshell; a film with a slick style, slick visuals, decent dialogue, but no action to top it all off. A lot is said, but not a lot is actually done. Honestly, if it wasn't for the intense language, this film couldn't have a hit a Rated-R rating upon its action piece. That's right, one piece. Guy Ritchie is definitely setting his foot in the right direction after years of failure and embarrassment, and we'll see just how close to form he can actually reach now that Madonna is out of the picture. In the meantime, this movie's not worth of its slick title not just because it falsely advertises the film itself as a slam-bang British action piece, but because the term isn't even expressed that much. What a waste of cool slang.In the tootsie of a plot, we follow corrupt business leaders, petty thieves, Russian gangsters, a dead rock star, music managers with secrets, and more characters as their lives unexpectedly change as a favorite painting of a Russian mobster goes missing. Following this conflict are several tales intertwining and blending together as we progress closer to who has the painting, why he has it, and what's at stake for the painting. Following in the footsteps of Ritchie's greatest hits, all the qualities of his old-school British crime time films are present: valued object, thieves, gangsters, people who don't know any better and one stand-out character that defines the style and personality of the entire piece itself. In this case, the RocknRolla isn't much of a charm, especially when compared to the likes of folks in Snatch and Lock, Stock. The plot is what keeps your attention going.Movies like this rely mostly on the acting and how they interact with the storyline. A lot of decent-but-unpopular actors leave their mark here, with upcoming actor Gerald Butler actually blending in with the cast of actors. The best performance is that of Tom Wilkinson, who steals the show as a corrupt real estate monster. Everyone else does a decent job, even Ludicrous. Guy Ritchie knows how to direct, its just a shame the story doesn't call for more action. The one action scene in the movie is incredible and hilarious at the same time, as it falsely finishes multiple times and leaves you gasping for more altogether. The rest of the film he uses a lot quick, short shots, and maintains a raw, slick style throughout. The film never tries to overpower you with huge sweeping shots of scenery; Ritchie's camera is down-to-earth, raw, and always close to the subjects.Also being the writer of the movie, Guy Ritchie has been hailed as a British Tarantino but this is only half-correct. It is true he loves dialogue, but unlike Tarantino, that's all he delivers. Tarantino is known for mixing monologues with endless dialogue with excessive action, crazy surprises, and enough one-liners for a dinner party. Ritchie on the other hand uses excessive pointless dialogue very loosely and focuses more on enhancing and continuing the plot. Not saying either method is wrong, but in the case of RocknRolla, if Ritchie had written and Tarantino directed we would have had a movie more along the likes of Reservoir Dogs instead of Revolver. Instead, we get a lot of talk, but little gunfire, fighting, explosions, double-crosses, and/or epic chase of some sort. What hurt the most is the potential involved, especially with the stylistic choices in editing, framing, directing, acting, writing, cinematography, and musical selections.Bottom Line: RocknRolla is an entertaining story that suffers from being told instead of displayed. This is more the fault of the writing above everything else, as the tale has so much to talk about, but so little action. The pacing, acting, directing, among other things provide enough momentum to blow us away, but this isn't fully delivered. To add a little light to this review though, Guy Ritchie is definitely recovering quality-wise, and (especially with the way the film ended) we could see even better work in the upcoming years. Instead, come into this movie expecting a good story with plenty of dialogue, but nothing more.Slick on style, slim on execution: that's the kind of stuff I don't expect out of a true Rockn'Rolla.P.S. The potential for awesome t-shirts is definitely here too.",RocknRolla

Fantastic camera work, sparkly, witty dialog, and as usual a cast of brilliant, mostly British actors. What else do you need? Critics don't know what to do with Guy Ritchie. He is hard to pin down and put a tidy label on. He is neither here nor there. That confuses people. I think his masterful ease and ironic smirk make him stand apart among many of today's directors.

80,tastyhotdogs,Could have rocked more,6,16 March 2009,"With wifey out Friday night, it was the perfect chance for me to see a film she'd hate. After a decent walk around the store, i stumbled across ""RockNRolla"". My buddy Gary had said it was solid, and I'd liked ""Snatch"" and ""Lock, Stock..."", so figured this was a can't miss. Or was it? The film, like the others mentioned, is about a bunch of bandits who are all trying to pull something off and their stories gradually become intertwined. It revolves around Lenny (Tom Wilkinson, in his best role since ""Rush Hour""), a shark who due to his connections decide what infrastructure projects go ahead. When a Russian offers $7million to get a stadium built quickly, Lenny finally meets his match. Throw in a precious painting, lots of cash, some junkies and small-time crooks and you have a recipe for disasters.A great cast, most prominently led by Mark Strong as Archie (my favourite B grade actor of the 2000's) and Toby Kebbell as Johnny. Both these guys should have had more prominent roles and meatier dialogue. Sadly, the movie was relatively ho-hum with no great memorable scenes, except maybe the one where Handsome Bob asks a special request of OneTwo before his prison sentence. Awkward but clever. A decent try but certainly two rungs below Ritchie's two great works.",RocknRolla

82,gary-444,A Solid Return to Form,6,10 September 2008,"Director Guy Ritchie is quite good at making London gangster films and this certainly bears favourable comparison with his two previous efforts, ""Lock, Stock etc"", and ""Snatch"". Featuring multiple characters, a plot that thinks it is more complicated than it is,entertaining banter, and some ""biff, bang, wallop"" violence, it offers more than enough for its core audience.The ending is more wrap up than conclusion, and the proliferation of characters gives precious little time for them to ""breathe"" individually. Perversely at 114 minutes the running time stays just within its welcome, suggesting that the story itself could have been sharpened up.Bent accountant, Stella, played by the sassy Thandie Newton is wonderful and deserves more space.Whilst Ticket Tout Mr Big, Nonso Anozie, fresh from his strong performance in ""Cass"" is strangely anaemic and unconvincing.There is a strong homosexual thread running through the narrative offering much opportunity for humour. Ritchie's treatment of the theme is pretty ambivalent with female characters largely absent.The sexy accountant is, naturally, laid by ""one of the boys"" whilst the only other female character of note is bedroom bait for a corrupt Councillor. It appears that Ritchie ""doesn't do relationships"" in his films.Although a return to form, Ritchie is curiously tentative in some parts of the film.The opening cash heist is preposterously inept, whilst the subsequent cash heist descends into comic book violence. It is almost as if Ritchie doesn't know quite where to pitch it. Equally there is a brief gay sado - masochistic torture scene which is set up, but never ""delivers"". Tarrantino would have milked it for much more explicit violence ( the cellar scene in Pulp Fiction), and humour.The 25 year old ""Long Good Friday"" still stands as the modern London Gangster film to beat, and whilst failing in that tilt, still delivers a pretty good attempt at the title.Multi national London, bursting with foreign cash and schemers is still a rich seam of opportunity to work and the possible sequel would not be unwelcome.The absence of a bloodbath finish gives plenty of characters room for more in the next installment.",RocknRolla
83,barrys82,Guy Ritchie did it again,9,14 October 2008,"After some failures in his career as a director, Guy Ritchie is back with a fast paced, frenetic movie. A film about a Russian mobster orchestrates a crooked land deal, millions of dollars are up for grabs, and all of London?s criminal underworld wants in on the action. Everyone from a dangerous crime lord to a sexy accountant, a corrupt politician and down-on-their-luck petty thieves conspire, collude and collide with one another in an effort to get rich quick. The story is interesting and the plot is very well developed. Its a film with lots of action and adventure, it has also a very good amount of black humor, characteristic from Ritchie's movies, and full of twists and an unexpected ending.The direction from Ritchie is excellent, the first hour might be a little slow but from the second hour till the end the movie takes a very fast rhythm and the fast forwards and slow motions increases the intensity of the movie. The cast is amazing, Gerard Butler gives a formidable performance, Thandie Newton also very good, Tom Wilkinson flawless as always and the secondary roles from Toby Kebbell (Johnny Quid), Idris Elba (Mumbles) and Mark Strong (Archie) gave the movie a very good support. In conclusion, RocknRolla is a entertaining movie you will enjoy and that will keep you on the edge of your seat.",RocknRolla
84,GeorgeRoots,Guy Ritchie Can Do Better.,5,17 August 2014,"As far as Guy Ritchie's London gangster films go, this probably remains his weakest entry. Of course it was never going to top ""Lock, Stock And Two Smoking Barrels"" (1998) or ""Snatch"" (2000), they are both filled with similar story telling traits and dialogue. But sadly, I just can't say the same for ""Rock'n'Rolla"".I'm sorry, but I cannot stand Gerard Butler in this picture. I admit I can enjoy him in certain pictures, but I found him so unconvincing in this movie he became more uninteresting throughout. Even Thandie Newton I don't mind as a performer, but she ends up playing a really bland character. It's Tom Wilkinson and Toby Kebbel as the head mobster and his estranged step-son who arguably steal the show, Tom's foul language and Toby's constant drug abuse do keep the film barely going.The colour scheme in this movie has a ""sepia"" tone all throughout the film and looks awful, which is strange cause I like that colour in older gangster movies. For the majority of the movies duration, it really is quite a drag to watch. The story is what gives ""Rock'n'Rolla"" an average mark, and you can get hooked into it instantly like most of Ritchie's films. But for the most part, I watched it once and have no ambition to see it ever again.Final Verdict: Decent enough, though I wouldn't recommend it. Better to seek out the directors previous work. 5/10.",RocknRolla

In this film, the action seemed more carefully paced, and the narrative didn't rocket beyond comprehension as seems to be the case in some of his projects. ROCKNROLLA seemed a true collaborative effort, and the entire ensemble seemed to revel in the crackling dialog of this droll, black-hearted gangster film. Tom Wilkerson was especially convincing as the harried kingpin, Lennie Cole.",RocknRolla

87,asifahsankhan,"Draw your attention to the Flipside of the discussion (Written in boring bold black and white, secretly)",8,12 February 2017,"When you're British, you don't need to go on bragging about yourself being the ""Best,"" everyone pretty much accepts that already. So when structuring a group of British gangsters one distinguishes them with some clear obvious notes. Sure they may dress better than Wall Street overlords, and have more class, but they also, nevertheless, don't just think big, they think bigger and smarter. They are the Brits for Christ sake. Which also means they don't talk trash like the Italian mobsters or live as filthy as the gangs of New York. But yes, they are indeed gangsters. Dangerous and merciless -- but one of a kind. They'd kill you but in their own way. In fact, they won't waste even a nick of time when they mean business or in other words, when they want to kill you, they will come and simply kill you. It's one of those rare circular con jobs where you can more or less figure out what's going on, and you can more or less understand why nobody else does, although at various times, they all think they do, and at other times, you're wrong. While they engage in these miscalculations, they act terrifically dangerous to one another -- so smoothly you'd swear they were in the second year of a repertory tour.After a botched land deal, One Two (Gerard Butler) and Mumbles (Idris Elba) steal the money they need to pay back fixer Lenny Cole (Tom Wilkinson), with the help of accountant Stella (Thandie Newton). But their plans are complicated by a Russian oligarch and his one beloved ""lucky"" painting... That's Guy Richie's film. As with Richie's ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" or ""Snatch"", this is another narrative underrated class, setting up One Two and Mumbles -- the nominal everyday-criminal-heroes (it's when your villains are much stronger and far better than you are) -- who navigate us through a series of subplots, including one about a never-seen stolen painting that skews too close to Pulp Fiction's running gag about the briefcase. Though the comedy works well (there's a great scene where the gay Handsome Bob (Tom Hardy) has his way with One Two with a line like ""I want you""), the final reel is just too light, with a touch of sitcom about the - almost - consequence-free finale. It was pretty real and shows how a completely normal straight man would react if he finds out his best friend is gay and wants him. On the other hand he'd also probably be left in much awe if this the last night before his friend leaves for prison and for the next five years. The bottom line is, all these people chase the same money around with the success of doggie tail-biting, and it's a lot of fun, and it's not often in these con films that everybody is conning everybody, and they're all scared to death, and nobody knows which cup the pea is under. Some very hard cases from the London and Russian underworlds who are all trying to out-think on one another and to wonder which one has truly underestimated the other.But the one that stands out in between, so much so that it gives the film its title, is the strand dealing with Lenny Cole's wayward son, a crack-addicted rocker called Johnny Quid (Toby Kebbell). While that's a bit of a give away, the actual best thing about the film is Cole's right hand man and Quid's uncle (and sort of his childhood hero), Archy (Mark Strong). The ""title"" of the film secretly belongs to him, actually. And you'll know it right before the end through Quid. Speaking of which, it's a terrific turn from Kebbell, making sly digs at the music industry and drawing parallels between his rock world and the underworld with a turn that veers from cadaverous and vulnerable to whippet-like and surprisingly tough when times get the hardest. Proclaiming his status as the next Real ""RockNRolla"" (just like his Uncle) right before we all take him for granted.""RocknRolla"" is how they say ""rock and roller"" in the East End. It isn't as jammed with visual pyrotechnics or cool fight sequences but that's OK, because with anything more happening, the movie could induce motion sickness. It never slows down enough to be really good, and never speeds up enough to be the Bourne Mortgage Crisis, but there's one thing for sure: British actors enjoy playing gangsters as much as American actors love playing cowboys.The biggest misconception about Guy Ritchie is that he cares what the critics think about him - he doesn't. With his wife and his brother-in-law's stupid book in the papers on every other page these days – a steal for its terrific cast alone - he has to be pretty steady on his priorities. From the Banksy-style opening credits, it's clear that Ritchie wants this film to get to you. This is a film that grabs your attention, holds it and, for the bulk of its running time, actually warrants it. With RocknRolla, Ritchie isn't reverting, he's progressing.Don't expect any new tricks. Every character will still be introduced with a trademark flourish, lest our attention wander for a second. There will be an aggressive voice-over hinting at grand schemes gone haywire: this time it's a five-minute disquisition on hedge funds and London's property boom, which is so tragically 2007 (and tedious) you half expect a cameo from Tony Blair. But why should you? Just draw your attention to the flip side of the discussion: (Written in boring bold black and white all along) It's a story of Sex, Thugs and Rock 'n Rolla!",RocknRolla

However unfortunately rocknrolla although shows that it has promises it misses certain elements to it which rather than making a witty-snappy lock, stock or Snatch it ends up being rather dull and bland and the ones who are familiar with Guy Ritchies work will tell you that it is actually very difficult to defend and unfortunately the movie ends up being superficial Ritchie which is probably the only reason to sit right through it however I did not really enjoy this as I was expecting much better from Guy Ritchie and I can't believe that he is actually planning a sequel to this.ROCKNROLLA - 7.1 OUT OF 10",RocknRolla
89,kooleshwar,A typical/ not your typical guy ritchie movie.......,5,3 December 2008,"Almost everything about this movie is about guy ritchie....The problem with that is that it makes watching this movie very risky.The main issues are..His style has barely changed across the years.And his movie are all about the ending which normally culminates in comedy of errors and chances and twists of fate.After seeing so much ( or so few of his movies) there is no doubt that every Guy Ritchie movie i have seen has been less pleasurable than the earlier one.The good part though is that my mind seems to have a hit a plateau instead of continuing downwards.Which brings us to the real risk.After sitting through 90 minutes of his movies, seeing event after event of randomness and character building you wait in anticipation for the ending which you may hate you may love but will definitely send you in a tizzy.Here however you have the most sedate guy ritchie ending to date.Its almost as if nothing happened and leaves you feeling quite disappointed.This movie has its memorable moments as all his films do but these few and far between, once again i would like to stress how much guy ritchies movies are about the end.The other guy ritchie traits such as top notch acting direction camera-work background score are all there. But these have been of such high standards in all films that only a move in the other direction would merit any surprise or mention.As a standalone film this would have been a merely a decent film.If this is your first guy ritchie film than you would enjoy it more but its recommended that you see snatch or lock stock to be really blown away as this may dull your experience of watching those masterpieces.From the number of times I've mentioned guy ritchies name you can see that this movie is quite like putting all your eggs in one basket except that its rare that you come out merely with what you started when you play such a high risk game.in this case ill consider myself lucky that i came out not feeling completely disappointed.however i would advise that you treat this movie with caution and set your expectations right when you watch it.-s typical guy ritchie, lacklustre ending.+/-s typical guy ritchie.+s typical guy ritchie which means technically superb.total 5/10 (factoring in the fact that it fell below my expectations, however most people will take one look at the directors name and see this movie hence expectations cannot be ignored, proceed with caution).",RocknRolla

But I don't remember that any other of his movies would make such a big impression on me, like this film did. Like I said - it's crazy, it's the most definitely the funniest Guy Ritchie's movie. It has a great soundtrack and that really made this film better. There were many colorful characters, just like in all Guy Ritchie's crime flicks. And the plot was quite interesting, maybe not that complex and intellectual as Revolver's plot, but still good. There were few interesting dialogs, just like in all his movies. But the best thing was a direction. All Guy Ritchie's movies are well directed, but this one made a really big inpresion on me.

91,pinkliz41,This has nothing on Snatch,1,6 September 2008,"RocknRolla is your average British gangster film with not to many thrills. It drags for most of the yawning 1 hour 50 minutes, but does however contain some minor successes. Firstly to state that RocknRolla is definitely Ritchies worst. Not only this but it lacks tone and deep story telling that Ritchie was once good at doing. It disintegrates also on action and comedy, which sadly adds to the further half-handed mediocre of RocknRolla. The characters however, do sometimes interest with their more than average dialogue and quirky sense of humour. Despite saying that the characters do make their fair share of jokes, this doesn't alter the fact that it's not consistency throughout Rocknrolla. The action and stylish violence that Ritchie once demonstrated in Snatch sadly is mislaid by a poor story.So RocknRolla is by far not Ritchies best and should be kept away from audiences expecting the brilliance, well balanced story and classic action that Ritchie once shown in Snatch. Sadly though RocknRolla puts a downfall decline in Ritchies status and directorial package.",RocknRolla

Rocknrolla is loaded with tired clichés, Guy Richie clichés: gangstas, drugs, money, tough Russians, barons, guns, a stupid narrator, with his stupid voice and stupid accent trying to impress. Its as though Mr Richie does not know any better, he knows how to create certain effects maybe and generate a certain feel, but i would hardly call him an artist, at max a student with a decent portfolio.

93,moutonbear25,Ritchie's Playground,7,4 November 2008,"Boys will be boys, even when they're men who haven't been boys for a very long time. They like to get their guns out and smack 'em around in the other boys' faces, all in an effort to prove who the baddest boy on the playground is. It doesn't matter to them that the playground has progressed into the entire city or that the guns have gone from plastic toys to the real deal. The game may have gotten heavier and plenty more serious, and the boys may have grown into the more rugged bodies of men, but they're still bumbling little boys at heart, too scared to do right and even more so to be a failure. This particular London playground that embodies all this manliness plays home to the modern gangster movie, ROCKNROLLA, and the boy at the top of the mountain is none other than Guy Ritchie.Ritchie has had a rough go at establishing himself as one of today's big boys as of late. He burst on to the scene in 1998 with LOCK, STOCK AND TWO SMOKING BARRELS. The fast moving action and even faster dialogue grabbed a lot of men by their own sensitive boys, squeezed hard and made them feel like bigger men. (Personally, I couldn't make out a single word being said and lost track about 20 minutes in so I never made it that far.) Ritchie's momentum grew into a Hollywood step with his follow-up, SNATCH, but his favour quickly faded after his critical disaster, SWEPT AWAY. I mean, it wasn't great but critics went in with their own guns blazing. You simply don't make a vanity project outside of your genre with your superstar wife, especially when that wife (or soon to be ex-wife) is Madonna, one of the most critically panned actresses of all time. No one even noticed his last release, REVOLVER, but now Ritchie is back. The problem is he isn't really better than ever; he's just back where he left off before everything was, well, swept away.Lucky for Ritchie, he's got a great group of mates along for this ride. ROCKNROLLA's cast is top notch no matter what Ritchie's expansive script calls for. Whether you're watching Gerard Butler dance entirely out of step with Thandie Newton at a party while exchanging brief quips about a heist job or Tom Wilkinson being a right bastard (which he does so well) as the man who runs the streets or Butler dancing yet again, this time in a close embrace with good pal, Handsome Bob (Tom Hardy), before he is shipped off to prison, there is always a sense of playfulness that never loses sight of purpose. The purpose on the other hand is a little too far out of reach. There are bad guys and good guys who are essentially bad guys themselves and they are all involved in some sort of construction zoning law shakedown that touches the junkies of the world as well as the Russian mafia and pivots around this one missing lucky painting, which, with a quick nod to the mysterious contents of a certain briefcase in the modern gangster classic, PULP FICTION, is never seen on screen. Complicated? Yes. Overly so? Maybe, only time will tell there. A good, fun time? For sure. Ritchie is sharp and has a keen eye for style. He hasn't quite mastered the balance between sleek and simple yet, as his simpler bits are rendered somewhat puny in comparison with his flare. Still, you can tell he's having a great time piecing it all together. There are the dirty, dark sets, the driving pulse of the often-obscure soundtrack choices (no more cheeky early Madonna pop tracks to be found here) and the sexy voice-over (a clearly spoken narration that was my personal saviour at times) to provide constant entertainment. My hopes for Ritchie though are that ROCKNROLLA does not amount to he himself being a ""Rock n Rolla""  a boy pretending to be living large instead of actually living it. Next time out, I want to see Ritchie one step closer to being a real man.",RocknRolla
94,honorhorror,"No deviation from Guy Ritchie formula, but offered a lot of fun.",8,11 August 2009,"What are you really expecting from this movie? If you are expecting the same sort of fun that Snatch offered, you will get it and get it in all the possible ways you can imagine. But if you are expecting something to totally blow you away, you might be a bit disappointed.Different from Ritchie's rough, surreal feeling that dwelled in Snatch and Lock Stock, Rocknrolla is shot in a quite tranquilized and polished way. And the cast just can't stop being inflated. From Jason Statham to Gerald Butler, from Brad Pitt to Mark Strong, from Vinnie Jones to Tom Wilkinson, the movie definitely gave you a decent way to pay off all the black comedy. But, this is still pure Ritchie fun.There is one thing that caught my eye, which is the stress Ritchie put on the stage performances this time. Before, his movies have all the weird circumstances on the streets and the spontaneous performances from all the main cast. None of them will ever go too serious facing the camera, letting you know it's a black comedy anyway. This time, with Tom Wilkinson and Mark Strong play against each other, the situation changed...a little bit on the surface. If you don't have a strong sense of humor or if you can't concentrate on the movie, you will probably consider it a Godfather-homage. However, their interactions are some of the funniest I have seen in months. When Lenny is telling the Russian the lie he fabricated, he wanted to pin it on Archie, Mark Strong's expression was priceless. Some similar hilarious moments are One-two and Stella's dancing and briefing. When you see these two untrained buttocks twitching as a cover to their secret briefing, you just have to laugh your teeth off......Anyway, the final result is as good as before. Although the story feels a little old, it's still a most entertaining and relaxing experience.",RocknRolla
95,WubsTheFadger,RocknRolla,8,28 February 2018,"Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadgerFirst off, I am a huge Guy Ritchie fan. Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, Snatch, and Sherlock Holmes are amazing films. If you have seen Snatch or Lock and Stock, you have already seen this film. But Guy Ritchie thrives in British crime story's and tells the story so easily. The story is complex, has great characters, and a great ending. The only downside to the story is it can be hard to follow and there are a lot of characters.The acting is great. Tom Wilkinson, Thandie Newton, Idris Elba, Tom Hardy, Jeremy Piven, Ludacris, and Toby Kebbell all perform great. Gerard Butler and Mark Strong deliver the best performances.The pacing is very fast and this can make the film hard to follow. The runtime is also a little overlong.Pros: Great British crime story, interesting characters, fast pacing, great acting, and mazing performances by Gerard Butler and Mark StrongCons: The story can be confusing because it is so complex, the pacing is also very fast which can also lead to confusion, an overlong runtime, and there are a lot of characters which can lead to further confusionOverall Rating: 8.1",RocknRolla
96,Semisonic,"If there's such thing as swag in this world, this is it",9,25 July 2015,"When one says ""Guy Ritchie's cult film"", they usually mean either Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels or Snatch. No wonder. These films defined Ritchie as a world-famous director, and since they both found their way to the IMDb Top 250, apparently the audience loves them too.I saw those films, and they are without a doubt a high class cinema. Yet it is RocknRolla that i truly fell in love with. And there's a reason for that. You see, Guy Ritchie might be a god, but not an almighty one. His field is called ""criminal comedy"", this is the genre which he rules. And when it comes to criminal comedies, there are two things that are the most important - the criminal part and the comedic one. And while to some it might seem like an easy thing - ""just shoot and make jokes"" - in fact it's not that simple. Crimes are essentially bad from the regular people's point of view, and to be believable they do have to look serious. But serious things don't make people laugh, especially when it comes to robbing or killing people. So keeping all the grimy details but serving them in a way so that the audience takes them with a light-hearted smile is a real art.I think Guy Ritchie wasn't always a true wizard of his craft. His skills and tricks needed some time and practice to hone. And while his earlier films had the advantage of freshness, which is probably why they are so highly rated by people, they lacked a certain subtlety and technical perfection. Both Lock Stock and Snatch had their not-so-brilliant moments when they were losing the pace or were getting a bit too dramatic to be fun. It might mean more versatility, but when you have a particular genre to tend to, versatility at the cost of breaking out of it isn't always a good thing.Enter RocknRolla. A traditionally intricate and ingenious story about the people of the under- and upper world and the incredible coincidences that bring them together. It's pointless to describe what exactly happens in Ritchie's movies, since it's not the plot that makes a difference, it's the little episodes and details. And in this film our master shows himself as a real genius. To me, there was no single unnecessary scene or character, no single miss of intonation. This is a long film - almost two hours - and during all this time it never makes you feel bored or sad. And this is exactly the kind of magic we expect Guy Ritchie to cast on us, right? The only downside i could find in this film is that its main twist was sorta taken from another British crime comedy, Layer Cake, a film that tries its best to look as if it was made by Ritchie, but it isn't. It's not that much of a disappointment, since these movies are totally different in all the other details and the overall delivery, but it kinda undermines the creative genius of Guy Ritchie who, given four years between these two films, could've come up with some other equally fitting trick from up his sleeve.Other than that, RocknRolla is the best i have seen from Guy Ritchie so far, and probably the best criminal comedy there is. Perfectly polished, perfectly balanced and perfectly delivered. And it's simply too bad that Butler, Elba, Hardy and the other principal actors don't see it fit for themselves to take on the sequel that was promised. Because nothing they have done ever since is even close in either style or substance to RocknRolla (Hardy's Warrior is the exception that only proves the rule), and it's simply unfair to make the fans wait for so long.",RocknRolla

98,SpoilerAlertReviews,One of Guy Ritchie's best,10,31 May 2016,"I'm throwing this out here, being my throwback Thursday review and the fact one of my favourite actors Toby Kebbell is on the big screen with Warcraft as Durotan at the moment. This film is one of Guy Ritchie's finest but possibly the most overlooked of his catalogue and I think that's because of the bad reception his film, Revolver got back in 2005. I think viewers were expecting another Snatch or Lock,Stock but got something slightly different and not the usual Guy Ritchie film were accustomed to. In all fairness, forgetting it's Guy Ritchie at the helm and you'll find it's a good movie. Three years later and RocknRolla gets released bragging a massive cast of stars who are now all major players, with the trademark silly nicknames us Londoners seem to cherish banishing the real names as secret identities or alter egos. Gerald Butler as One Two, Idris Elba as Mumbles and Tom Hardy as Handsome Bob make the core of the criminal gang better known as the Wild Bunch. This film is how Tom Hardy got the part for Christopher Nolan's Inception. Tom Wilkinson is awesome as the 'bricks and mortar' real-estate crooked businessman with charismatic heavy, Mark Strong at his side as Archie. Toby Kebbell playing 'The' RocknRolla Johnny Quid, is nothing short of amazing, showing his ferocious talent and gives one of the best analogies, being about life and a pack of cigarettes. Other stars getting involved are Ludicrous (ironically casted under his real name Chris Bridges) Jeremy Piven, Thandie Newton, Gemma Arterton, Matt King and Geoff Bell. It also boasts an excellent soundtrack with classic tracks from Black Strobe, The Sonics and even had the Subways perform 'Rock and Roll Queen' live in the film. Typically of Guy Ritchie films, the plot gets convoluted, everyone being somehow connected to each other, or clashing somehow, setting off a chain of events with ironic black humour and a painting that we never see, as a kind of Marcellus Wallace centre piece to the film. Has a great, fast talking script loaded with the usual witty comebacks expected from a Ritchie film and classic scenes like the second money heist that goes horribly wrong leading our antiheroes being chased by crazy Russians and the grand finale with the fight in the lift. It's sleek, it's cool, it's dark, it's funny, but not in the Lock, Stock, Snatch kinda funny; but is one of Guy Ritchie's best. It's beautifully put together, filmed and edit with a faint sepia tone which almost makes the film tainted by tobacco smoke. There's a hint of it being the first part of a trilogy but there's no sign anywhere that the real RocknRolla and the wild bunch will return. PLEASE MR. RITCHIE! Can we have the rest!? Why you tease us? I'll leave you with the analogy that is spoken so eloquently well by Johnny Quid AKA the RocknRolla, Toby Kebbell. ""All you need to know about life is retained in those four walls. You will notice that one of your personalities is seduced by the illusions of grandeur: the gold packet of king-size with a regal insignia, an attractive implication towards glamour and wealth, the subtle suggestion that cigarettes are indeed your royal and loyal friends - and that, Pete, is a lie. Your other personality is trying to draw your attention to the flip side of the discussion: written in boring bold black and white, it's a statement that these neat little soldiers of death are in fact trying to kill you - and that, Pete, is the truth. Oh, beauty is a beguiling call to death and I'm addicted to the sweet pitch of its siren. That that starts sweet ends bitter, and that which starts bitter ends sweet. THAT is why you and I love the drugs and that is also why I cannot give that painting back. Now please, pass me a light.""

100,RickHarvey,"If it ain't broke, don't fix it",6,30 July 2010,"If i ain't broke , don't fix it. Fans of Guy Ritchie would of seen this film before, titled as Lock stock.. and Snatch. After a couple of flops, Guy sticks to what he knows, making mockery Gangster movies set in London. Instead of Two antique shotguns or a large Diamond, the centre of the story is now acted out by a lucky painting.This film provides nothing new. Guy played it safe but i get the impression he was trying to hard to make this film stand up against his early classics. The characters were unlikeable. Everyone played there part well but not one of them could get me involve. Jonny Quid is the exception as he was the most unique character. What we get with this film is more of Guy's crazy camera work and more great dialogue ( mind you, there not many brilliant one liners compared to the other two ) The film is good but nothing special and unfortunately easily forgettable. Some scenes are just stupid with over the top violence. it worth a viewing but it never going to be good enough for the second",RocknRolla
101,Craig_McPherson,The Former Mr. Madonna bounces back - with a vengeance,7,14 November 2008,"Heralding RocknRolla as a return to the smart, fast paced, witty form Guy Ritchie successfully developed with Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and Snatch might be a tad generous, but it's definitely a solid comeback after the turds he dropped with Revolver and Swept Away.The quick cuts, clever scene transitions, snappy dialog and oddball characters are all in place (keep an eye out for what has to be cinema's fastest depiction of a sex scene), but manage to get bogged down somewhat by a script that tries to be a little too clever. This isn't to say that RocknRolla disappoints. In fact, even with its flaws it succeeds where other star laden vehicles have failed (Body of Lies and Pride and Glory, being two notable examples).Built around a cast of oddball characters, the plot unfolds as a gang of low-level hoods headed by the quirkily-named One Two (Gerard Butler) gets tipped off about pending money transfers between a Russian mobster and British crime lord Lenny Cole (Tom Wilkinson, in fine form), and decides to pull heists of their own, stealing mob money. What results is a calamitous and often humorous chain of events as members of the Russian and British underworld try to figure out which group of wise-guys are hijacking the loot.Tossed into the mix for color is the side story of Johnny Quid (Toby Kebbell), a sad sack rock star and crack head with anger management issues who just happens to be Cole's stepson who's made habit out milking dad out of dough and avoiding payment by repeatedly faking his own death and going underground.Ritchie does a good job holding the viewer, even if the story tries to pack in so many different elements (including a chuckle-inducing sub-plot involving a gay hood with a crush on One Two) that it seems at times as though the story will at any moment go careening off the rails.Perhaps the best performance is turned in by Mark Strong, who was arguably the best thing about Body of Lies, this time portraying the unflinchingly loyal yet ruthless Archie, Cole's right hand man. If ever the was an actor to keep an eye on, Strong's it. He brings to the table all the elements for marquee star power in years to come, making this the second release this year in which he's outshone just about everyone on screen around him.The final verdict? RocknRolla represents a promising first step in (the former) Mr. Madonna's comeback, and based on what this film portents, Ritchie's best stuff is yet to come, and that's a good thing.",RocknRolla
102,andymaranam,Ritchie does it again..,8,22 March 2019,"Undeniably one of the better British film's in its genre.

A top, top shelf movie, with alot of humour..no spoilers so simply a great watch & a solid 8/10",RocknRolla
103,Ishallwearpurple,A 'mature' woman's review-I like it!---,8,13 November 2008,"A few comments about RockNRolla. I love gangster/mob films (Hong Kong over-the-top stylized violence), if they are not too bloody and not too much nasty language. So I was expecting RnR to be what it is - a gangster film with lots of cussin' and shootin' etc. Actually, I was surprised it was shot in such a way that some of the mayhem is off screen and you just hear it or the others are talking about it. There is a lot to be said for quick cuts. The cast are all so good it is a pleasure to watch them morph into these mobsters, lowlifes and druggies. Gerard Butler is One-Two, the leader of The Wild Bunch, and is full of doofus charm.. The character isn't brilliant, but he is good-hearted to his mates. His dancing scene with Stella (Thandie Newton) the crooked bookkeeper for the Russian mobster, is very funny. He is either a good dancer and playing an awkward one; or really a bit awkward. Anyway, it is very cute and he and Thandie are darling together. Idris Elba (Mumbles) & Handsome Bob (Tom Hardy) are the rest of The Wild Bunch. The encounter between One-Two and Handsome Bob is funny and sweet and even though One-two is shocked at first, he handles it so well and the two actors are just very good. Nice script writing. Or did the actors improvise some? Then One-Twos conversation with Mumbles about Bob is so funny and puts a human face on these violent criminals.Other acting standouts are Toby Kebbell as Johnnie Quid (the RockNRolla) as the druggie step-son of Tom Wilkinsons mob boss (although I did get tired of Tom acting at the top of his voice), and his right-hand man Archie played by Mark Stong, who is a violent man, but Stong's expressions as things take crazy twists and turns are priceless. Another good performance.The Russian mob after The Wild Bunch, who have stolen from them, is the funniest chase in a long time, which just ends because they all are so tired they can't run anymore. Oh, and the McGuffin priceless painting, which we never see except from the back, which is stolen many times, ends up at Stella's place. The Russian kingpin is not happy when he sees it (originally it belonged to him and he wants it back.) Will he have Stella killed? He's just asked her to marry him - but now, here's his painting - what's a billionaire mobster to do? We'll have to wait for RnR2 ""The Real RockNRolla,"" to find out. Since this is an ensemble film, no one is featured more than The Wild Bunch, I like that. I love The Wild Bunch, and hope they get to make 2 more films, writer/director Guy Richie has already written. They're cooool, just not as cool as they think they are. And when they ramp up the music near the end, it is a like a jolt of caffeine to the brain. WOW! Once around again! 8/10",RocknRolla

105,thomas-hardcastle-2,I loved Lock Stock and Snatch - this was almost awful...,5,3 February 2009,"Okay, so it's been a while since Guy Ritchie made Revolver, which really was a poor film on many levels. So, one would have thought Ritchie would have taken the feedback received for that film, and channelled the criticism into making something that might equal, if not top Lock Stock, or Snatch. What he has come up with is something that offers very little humour matched by a convoluted storyline, with weak characters.This monumental failure can best be characterised by Ritchie's choice of Tom Wilkinson as the head London gangster. In the past, when Ritchie watchers have been treated by the likes of Lenny McLean and Alan Ford, Wilkinson pales in comparison, due to his inability to master the cockney accent, and the overall weakness given to his character from the writing. The overall feeling in Lock Stock and Snatch was that the bad guys had the power, and were scary, whereas RockNRolla displays that the bad guys are pussies, and can be messed about with little consequence.Some performances in this film help bring it up slightly - Mark Strong and Toby Kebbell are both brilliant in their own way, and fit their characters uncannily, saving the casting director any further blushes.The storyline, as would be expected in most Ritchie gangster films, is complicated, with the difference this time being that it was unnecessarily complicated. Snatch and Lock, Stock needed certain characters and particular situations to act as catalysts for the next section of the film to take place. It seems that with RockNRolla, most of it was added to make the ensemble cast appear larger than it needed to be.The worst thing about this film, though, is the severe lack of any humour at all. When compared with the biting scripts of his previous work, Ritchie can only be criticised for his dearth of imagination. He seems to have lost his spark for creative and witty dialogue contained in humorous situations.Overall, I probably will not watch this film again, for a very long time. It's disappointments heavily outweigh its plus points. Whilst it is shot in a creative way, and the script, characters and storyline smack of Ritchie-isms, I could not help but get the impression it was Ritchie mimicking himself, rather than coming up with another brilliant film. He appears to have forgotten what made him great in the first place, and has taken a formula, added nothing, and has expected people to come flocking back - a big mistake.",RocknRolla
106,dgjones-62258,Style Over Substance,4,13 July 2020,I can't believe that Guy Ritchie made the most basic error - he didn't have a protagonist to care about. With no emotional input into the movie/film I was bored with interesting scene after interesting scene that turned into a long car crash.A pop video from the 1990's.Superbly directed action flick that had a promising idea but needed more to get me involved in the story.,RocknRolla

But I will say that it is good to see a good crime comedy and Gerard Butlers wackiest performance I've ever seen.The elements and delivery of RocknRolla are very similar to Guy Ritchie's Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and also Snatch and even the lesser known Layer Cake. Some of the dialog is typically incomprehensible but I guess thats what London slang is supposed to be. The multiple story lines didn't really cause me any confusion as they were at least decently executed. All the performances are well done. I didn't have any complaints. The heist scene was the best part of the movie. It was when they try to rob the Russian war criminals and it was so hilarious that I had to rewind and watch a couple times more. Other than that it seemed typical to Ritchies predecessors. Overall I still recommend RocknRolla because his delivery methods of a good crime film still seem fresh. Though in my opinion this isn't quite as spectacular as Lock, Stock and Snatch, I still think it is a worth while watch.",RocknRolla

110,alexkolokotronis,A Small Movie That May Make Big Things Happen For the People Involved,8,23 June 2009,"RocknRolla seems to be the beginning of the resurrection of Guy Ritchie's career. Not to anyone's surprise he does this with what he has been so potent with throughout his career; a British gangster film. If you've had any experience with Ritchie movies you know exactly what you're getting into here, a comedic thriller. This of course may seem problematic, in Ritchie's case it is not.The writing and dialog is fast paced and quite witty and entertaining to watch. The movie as a whole maybe be a bit of a head scratcher here and there but the pay off is good and the idea is a bit of a parody of itself which is what makes this film so fun.What Ritchie accomplishes though, in the same way he has with his past successful productions is putting together an extremely diverse and yet correlating cast. This starts with the lead man in Gerard Butler whose notoriety has steadily risen largely through his performances of comical caricatures (not an insult). With RocknRolla Butler seems to have found a role perfect for his appeal and charm he brings to the screen. This is largely because of a witty script and great, fun performances all around.Then of course there is Mark Strong who until this year was largely a total unknown, at least in the American mainstream. While Gerard Butler may have found a genre he is most strongly suited for, Mark Strong could certainly use this along with Body of Lies to launch to the very least a respectable acting career. His posture, range and ability to change tone and style subtly not only between films but within them is something that should be and surely will be recognized.",RocknRolla

Obviously apart from guy ritchies excellent direction it had some absolutely fantastic dialouge with some pin sharp conversations and trademark British humour.The story revolves around several characters, each do something that affects another character within the story.

Well it is evident that British accent is different than the American. But I loved watching them because there are undoubtedly a lot of quality British films out there. The entire film made me ride on the laughs and jogs of the characters, not exactly knowing what they're into. All I know is about this circle of crime profession and a bunch of thugs and junkies. Well least to say, I do know what accountants where, and the accountant here was a freaking B***h. Gerard Butler always had this funny charisma I saw since P.S. I Love You (which I honestly didn't entirely liked at all) and The Ugly Truth. I saw it again in this film. The comedy didn't fail me; it was plainly simple and witty. Crime and action weren't new to me. But this is the first time I could remember well how they incorporated crime, action, sex and comedy. It was reasonably entertaining. It got the hype and drollness I remember from Daniel Craig's Layer Cake, only that the latter, though better, was less jesting. The characters were also uniquely blended. They got conspiracy, thrill, mystery, plot, action and humor. Toby Kebbel and Mark Strong were also remarkable, specially the latter one. Mark Strong always reminded me of some powerful secondary lead crime boss or even a primary one. The whole setting and story were solid for me and I recommend for those who look for jiffy switch of action, crime and comedy, RocknRolla isn't a bad option.",RocknRolla

Both films rank highly in my Top 20, and for that reason I absolutely adored, admired, and praised Guy Ritchie. Then came Madonna. And she ruined everything. Guy Ritchie was never the same after the marriage, directing the monstrosity that was SWEPT AWAY (with Madonna in the lead role, no less), followed by the garbled mess that was REVOLVER. ROCKNROLLA is supposed to represent Ritchie's return to his roots following the high-profile divorce, but it feels more forced and contrived than free-flowing and natural. Too much of the script feels borrowed and clichéd. It just doesn't live up to the promise of the first 10 minutes or so.Nonetheless, it is a step in the right direction, and is something to build on. There was simply too much focus on the uninteresting sub-characters. The sub-characters in LOCK, STOCK, AND TWO SMOKING BARRELS and SNATCH. were at least interesting and captivating, and invoked a genuine cause for concern. That is not the case here. There is just not enough screen-time for Gerard Butler, Tom Wilkinson, or the stunning Thandie Newton. Rocknrolla himself is not well-developed, save for a few scenes mildly reminiscent of the style of the Guy Ritchie of old.Again, the movie seems unnatural and forced. The ending is unsatisfactory and there is no real catharsis a movie like this may warrant. It's nowhere near as brilliant as his first two. But it's nowhere near as sickening as his previous two. 7/10 is quite generous, but I remain optimistic about what the future holds for Ritchie, now that he has gotten rid of the old (the very old) ball-and-chain. 2.5 stars. May appear on my Honourable Mention list. Maybe not. Hopefully, in the absence of Madonna, Ritchie can use this film as a stepping stone in the right direction.

116,johnslegers,Boring rehash of older work,4,14 January 2013,"With ""Revolver"", Ritchie made one of the most intellectually profound movies ever. Unfortunately, this seemed to alienate most of his fans (who like him for his action comedies), making his best movie also his most despised movie.With ""RocknRolla"", Ritchie returns to his roots. The problem with that is that this movie is not as fast-paced as it needed be, not as funny as it should be, nor as innovative as it could be and therewith totally felt lacking of anything worth grabbing my attention.After being copied over and over by various directors during the early '00s, the style that made Ritchie famous gradually became repetitive and dull. While ""Revolver"" offered a whole new dimension to the genre by replacing most of the humor with philosophy and symbolism, ""RocknRolla"" felt like a rather soulless attempt in the exact opposite direction. It felt uninspired and rehashed, leaving me constantly longing for more.The only thing this movie adds to his older work is a bit of fan service to his gay audience, which by no means added anything of value to the average straight guy.

It's basically just the same old same old from Guy Ritchie again, a reworking of Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels and Snatch, all cockney ""geezers"" and gangsters ""having it large"" and speaking in a cool way that nobody on Earth has ever spoken like. It has the clichéd Russian gangsters, the ""salt of the earth"" villains who destroy peoples lives but hey, they look after each others Mums, so you know, they're Saints really in Ritchie's gross fantasy.Absolutely nobody in the film is remotely likable, it plays to the usual movie tropes of glamorizing drugs or at the least making junkies seem comedic. The central villain played by a miscast Tom Wilkinson is brought down for the crime of ""grassing"" on various lowlifes and scumbags. Really? This is meant to be a bad thing? The Rocknrolla of the title is his stepson, a musician turned crackhead who is completely odious but is of course presented as witty and ""cool"" because he listens to The Clash.

But that was not the case and everything felt old and tiring. There were some good moments though, and most the dialog was funny and clever at times. It was entertaining, but overall it felt unspectacular and uncreative.In the end this is what we have seen a million times before, but worse.

First off Guy Ritchie is so divorced from the 'gangster' lifestyle that he tries to portray in this wretched movie (not that he was ever a 'part' of it in the first place) that his dialogue, characters and scenarios are stilted and forced to the extreme. Secondly, it borrows heavily not just from his own back catalogue, but also from classics like THE LONG GOOD Friday and PERFORMANCE. The plot centres around (the charisma-free, smug, self satisfied) Gerard Butler, and his gang of RADA-trained 'mockney' cohorts (all spouting un-hip cockney slang, and pretending to be something, they're clearly not) getting mixed up in stolen mob money, and a missing painting. The cast is rounded off with (the equally dire) Jeremy Piven, and a near skeletal Thandie Newton (how this woman gets 'work' amazes me?) Ritchie (in a final act of desperation) throws in every camera trick, to compensate his second (third and forth) hand material. And just like it's cast, it's pointless and nowhere near as clever as it thinks it is.The end result is an instant (ahem) 'cult' (did i spell that right?) movie, designed for wanky fan-boy types, favouring second hand style, over (any kind of) substance, other than to shift t-shirts, cds and books. The fact that it didn't shift nearly as much of either, is maybe an indication that audiences are wising up to Ritchie, and possibly demand more from a movie (like maybe a smidgen of 'heart' or 'soul'?)The sweetest victory for a disgruntled viewer (like myself) is the movies finale which promises that a sequel. I (for one) hope this never happens. But if it does, i hope that the money-men bankrolling this 'one trick' pony's 'mockney' wish-fulfilment, finally have the guts to tighten Mr Ritchie's reins, and force him to add some substance to proceedings (and maybe a cast that consists of genuine 'talent', and not just the 'flavour of the month brigade'?)This movie would make sufficient grounds for a 'divorce' (oh....wait a minute....it probably did?)",RocknRolla

If you wait much longer it probably won't be possible. For all you guys out there that like Ritchie gangster movies over Scorsese gangster movies (don't get me wrong Goodfellas was great but the characters were sociopaths/psychopaths and the violence was over the top). Guy brings palatable violence to the table in a thoroughly enjoyable vehicle! I've watched Goodfellas once and was impressed but never felt inclined to revisit but I've seen RocknRolla at least 10 times and now I've it memorized and I need fresh material Mr. Ritchie!

123,vincent-27,More (and less) of the same,2,12 June 2009,"After a couple of forays into non-gangster genres to try and prove his worth as a director, Ritchie has returned to his bread and butter, the British gangster film. I was a big fan of Lock Stock, and even more so for Snatch, which I considered his greatest work but it seems Ritchie has become too far removed from his mean and lean years. Ironically he's like an old rocker trying to rewrite his early hit, only to put out an inferior work that is just a pale imitation of former glory.First of all, this movie is a mess. A big mess. It makes you realize that what was great about Lock Stock and Snatch was not the intricate interweaving plot, but the characters. Characters make a movie, if you don't have that, you ain't got shinola. Sometimes you can gloss over this with snappy dialogue and good action, but sadly, this movie has neither. In fact, very little of what any of these people do makes any sense in this movie. People get shot but don't bleed, Russian gangsters shoot aimlessly into ceilings, or stop chasing somebody for no apparent reason. Some people found the whole chase scene with gangster amusing. I found it absurd, and not in a good way. I had a lot of promise, a really big dude, and a guy with a ridiculously cut body, but it's almost as if Ritchie just gave up on it and decided to move with the plot.Oh yes, the plot. There's not much of one, something about a painting that you never see (clearly a ripoff - sorry ""homage"" to Tarantino) and some money and a really forced ending that comes out of nowhere. I think the script feels half baked, and probably could have used 3 or 4 more rewrites, removed some characters and tightened it all up. The funniest part is that Ritchie has the stones to assume he will be making 2 more of these movies before even finding out how well this one does. Well, judging from the box office results, apparently not very well. Sorry Guy, who took the jam out of your dough nut?",RocknRolla
124,ozwillb,twaddle,2,3 August 2017,"Style over substance, disjointed rubbish, the direction was both shallow and yet again with Ritchie clichéd.

125,JoaoPovoaMarinheiro,"Welcome back, Guy Ritchie.",8,20 January 2009,"By the word 'coolest', I mean stylish, with style. 'RockNRolla' accomplishes that. It's a well-done crime movie and with plenty of style and fun. But let's get to the point.Starting up, I'm a big fan of Guy Ritchie's work ('Snatch.' is one of my favorite movies) and so I was kind of expectant with this, since his last works weren't successful: the misunderstood 'Revolver' and the awful 'Swept Away'. In the end, I was generally pleased, and it marked the similar type of movie as 'Snatch.'.This was quite an intriguing and funny experience, with that typical Guy Ritchie humor. I noticed that this is classified as an action movie, but I would only stick up with the 'comédie noire', because the action is very limited (the scene where One Two gets chased by the Russians was very funny and vertiginous).However, this isn't a movie for anyone and it isn't something we haven't seen already. If you're a Guy Ritchie, 'Snatch' or 'Lock, Stock' then you'll probably enjoy this. If you're not, then I'll lead it to your imagination.For those who know the British director's work, this is an enjoyable piece of work and has all those usual Guy Ritchie ingredients. The soundtrack, the editing, the solid exploitation of the characters and the plot with that final twist that is this director's trademark, make 'RockNRolla' an excellent experience.In other words, it's time to welcome back Mr.Ritchie to the business. 'RockNRolla' is in deed 2008's coolest movie and a must see for this director's fans. 8/10.",RocknRolla
126,framer94,3.9/10- crap,3,25 April 2009,"Gut Ritchie directed and wrote Lock, Stock and Snatch. Excellent films, razor sharp dialogue and electric cinematography, hugely international successful (and deservedly so)... for a long time Ritchie was the coolest, hippest director in the world... then he married Madona. If that wasn't bad enough, he then made an even worse mistake and made a film STARING MADONA- Swept Away. Swept Away marks the point at which Ritchie's career WAS SWEPT AWAY, lolz. His next movie 'Revolver,' had some funny dialogue and stuff in places, but overall felt forced, the script didn't flow naturally, and the plot was convoluted and unsure of itself, and overall the movie was crap.Gangster maybe the only genre Ritchie can... past tense... HAS successfully directed. But there's nothing wrong with that if the movies are good, and Lock, Stock and Snatch are f-king great movies (not a lot of great movies out there also!) Anyway onto the rant- This movie absolutely... f-king crap! -the plot is convoluted and unengaging, the script has some good typical Ritchie wit in places but that doesn't save the rest of the films... characters are unengaging and lacking heavily in character, the pace of the film is really slow and boring (at times making you feel like your watching a Richard Curtis film with a 15-certificate). There's a fight'n'chase sequence between one of the boys and some Russain mobsters that's really entertaining, but not I can actually recall as being 'wasn't that great!' The subtitle at the end of the movie notes that 'the boys will return in the next rock'n'rolla film. So he's gonna make another one? -oh noes!!!!!! >.< Do I recommend this turd? YES- BUT ONLY TO PEOPLE WHO LIKED RITCHIE'S FIRST 2 FILMS.

This movies basic formula can feel similar to the other movies he had made before and after but I think no one would complain much about it. To be honest I would like to watch a lot more of these in future.The acting from all the actors were very good. Everyone did fit into their own roles pretty swiftly. The editing and sound is great.

131,shariqq,"Unexpectedly, this time Guy Ritchie is not on an adrenaline rush",6,6 December 2008,"A few years and dismissible movies after he had been written off as a one-trick pony, Guy Ritchie proves that he can yet make a decent movie. With RocknRolla. Ritchie goes back to his trick-defining movie Snatch yet steps forward in his career with a mellowed down and grown-up movie, but, relative to his own movies.RocknRolla is about Sex, Thugs & Rock n Roll, but a very different kind of all of these from what we would immediately expect from any movie, let alone a ""Guy Ritchie"" movie. The movie doesn't really have defined protagonist/antagonist characters - it's about everyone wanting a bit more than they have, and what they have to go through to achieve it. Ritchie refrains from falling into his own traps, possibly with all the will-power he could muster, but still does not leave his trade-mark stylization behind in this labyrinth story where everyone is connected to everyone else. What also helps this movie to elevate itself is the starcast, and among the ensemble, one Mark Strong. He follows a powerful turn in Body of Lies with another omnipresent performance here, well accentuated by Tom Wilkinson, Gerard Butler and Jeremy Piven(!).The criss-crossing mish-mashing story never missteps and stays intriguing enough to warrant this movie a watch. Unexpectedly, this time Guy Ritchie is not on an adrenaline rush, and lets the movie unfold at a more human pace, though there is one key scene that fans of his stylization will thoroughly enjoy.My rating --> 3 of 5",RocknRolla

134,goldwriting,Ritchie Gives Tarantino the Ole' One-Two *mini-spoilers*,7,9 October 2008,"The man behind Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and Snatch is back once again with another chapter is his series of old school mob movies. RocknRolla follows along a certain tradition for Ritchie, fast talking and fast reacting characters keep the audience tense, because they have absolutely no clue what will happen next. Keep the characters unpredictable and keep the audience involved, that's the key. Now, if you noticed the title of this review, you might be wondering where the connection to Quentin Tarantino comes in (and that is a most perceptive and valid question. Well done, reader). After the movie ended I turned to my friend and said, ""One sentence review: The British Pulp Fiction."" He sat back, processed the comparison and smiled. ""Yep, you're totally right."" I'll show you what I mean while giving a brief overview of the story.RocknRolla follows a small gang of low level criminals known as The Wild Bunch, who get hired by a sexy accountant to rip off some big money from an even bigger mobster. What she didn't know is our little hooligans were already in debt to the local crime lord, who was doing business with the ""bigger mobster"". So money is stolen, circulated, recycled and everyone ends up chasing each others tails. Also, there is a painting that gets stolen and becomes the MacGuffin of the film, which is a cinematic term for an object that is central to the plot, but no one ever really sees it. People philosophize, people die and people are nearly sodomized.If the specifics of the comparison aren't gelling for you yet, here's a breakdown: - MacGuffins: Pulp Fiction has the briefcase, which we never see inside. RocknRolla has the painting, which we never see the front of.Crooks in way over their head: Gerard Butler and Idris Elba play the heads of The Wild Bunch and are constantly trying to keep one step ahead of being killed by the very person they are working for, just like John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson (more Travolta though, in this case).The Girl is the Problem: Thandie Newton is the instigator of the troubles which put Gerard into play, just like Uma Thurman goes after Travolta, thereby putting him in a situation of life or death.Multiple story lines: RocknRolla is not set up in the vignette fashion of Pulp Fiction, but both deal with a number of plot lines that all converge in the end to tie things up.Sodomy Interruption: Both films have a scene where a guy is about to be raped by a pair of leather clothed dudes, when someone comes in and makes the snap judgment on who to kill.It can be argued that some of these things are common to all movies of the crime/mob genre, but so many together in one film makes the case a little stronger. I'm not saying RocknRolla is bad, but I left feeling like I'd seen it before.RocknRolla won't be remembered in history for iconic performances, like Travolta and Jackson, but good work was done. Butler hams it up nicely as a crook-cum-swashbuckler with no dancing feet. His inherent suaveness comes to bear in his scenes with Thandie, but he also gets to show his willingness to play that in the direction of a different gender. Which brings up one big difference between this and Pulp Fiction, and this could be easily attributed to the time periods, but RocknRolla was doused in homo-erotic overtones. With sodomy, gay side characters and a subplot with Butler's best friend in the gang, it never gets too far away from it. This provided for some really amusing humor and grinningly awkward scenes. Idris gets to play the straight man, no pun intended, to Butler's machismo and he achieves it well. There is a certain calm to Idris on screen which makes me certain he's going to be around for a long time to come. Tom Wilkinson also gets to walk a little on the more wacky side as the crime boss of London, trying to prove he's still the big fish in town and time isn't passing him by. Thandie, who I've enjoyed on screen in the past, doesn't travel much farther beyond eye candy this time. Jeremy Piven and Ludicrous appear as music producers, but get paltry little screen time. The one person who'll leave the biggest visual impression is Toby Kebbell, as Johnny Quid. He spends most of the film shirtless and brings back frighteningly skinny images of Chistian Bale from The Machinist. Bale still wins the freakish battle, but Kebbell kept enough muscle tone to still look dangerous as well, which gives him an edge. Lastly, blink and you'll miss Gemma Arterton, who will be seeing much more of in the upcoming Bond film, Quantum of Solace.Ritchie on the other hand delivers once again in more traditional style. As I mentioned before, fans of those two early films of his will certainly enjoy this. The attitude is there, the raw edge is there and the camera-work is rife with quick cuts and whip pans, just like we're used to from him. He also wrote the film again, which helps even more keep the style intact. I think many people will be glad to see the old Guy Ritchie back on the silver screen.Recommendation: A good flick, bordering on great, far from amazing. If you're a fan of Ritchie from the past, you won't be disappointed. If you've never seen a film of his before, feel free to check this out, but don't stop here, see Snatch and Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels as well. As for the theater experience, after the initial whip panning frenzy in the first ten minutes, it settles down and becomes quite enjoyable. I also recommend Rasinettes over Goobers (take that, peanut lovers!).",RocknRolla

This isn't a good comparison. Where Tarantino can write great plots and fantastic dialogue, Ritchie is rubbish at plots, but good at putting words into peoples mouths. Here there are too many double crosses and back handed deals, the plot drags under the weight of the 'clever' plotting. When Ritchie learns that this doesn't work and simplifies his work he really will be a great writer/director. At least it isn't as bad as 'Revolver' was.The acting for the main characters is great. They play well rounded characters that spit fantastic dialogue. The secondary characters are too thin and I honestly can't remember a single thing any of them had to say.

The Sun newspaper ranked it as the best movie of the year, whereas the film critic for The Guardian typed his rating instinctively: one star.

140,travis_iii,A bit better than Swept Away... a bit,3,12 September 2008,"The consensus seems to be amongst contributors here that RocknRolla is a 'return to form' for Guy Ritchie. I should point out at this point that I don't accept the premise that he had ever struck vein of 'form' in the first place. He did to some extent (and not necessarily to his credit) create a distinctive genre of British film with Smoking Barrels and Snatch and, in the sense that this is almost identical to those earlier films, RocknRolla it is certainly a return to something.I'm a Londoner; my parents were Cockney and my grand-parents were Cockney (in fact my Auntie Elsie lived only a few streets away from Violet Kray), and as such I have always thought of Ritchie's Mockney gangster genre as the rather sad fantasy of a bored and insecure middle-class public schoolboy sitting in his 'dorm' reading ""A Profession of Violence"" and wishing that Mad Frankie Fraser was his dad and that Frankie would turn up in the senior common room one day and give a good slapping to all those rotten school bullies.I've never found any of Ritchie's films funny and I certainly didn't laugh at RocknRolla. It's juvenile, has a silly plot and is too long as well. The characterisation is poor and the dialogue is annoying and dotted with the kind of toe-curling phony philosophising that would probably not even make it into a Kabala recruiting video.Ritchie is a director of some technical skill but his limited imagination and interest in the human world at large means that he will never make a film outside this Mockney Gangster genre (Swept Away showed us the disaster that ensues when he tries). The fans are there for the Mockneys and I'm sure he'll continue to make more at ever lengthening intervals, probably with decreasing budgets and eventually going straight to DVD. They will all follow exactly the same formula and I won't sit through another.",RocknRolla
141,MrPink08,Rocknrollin its way to one of the best films of the year,10,27 October 2008,"Everybody loved Lock Stock & Two Smoking Barrels and Snatch. Everyone hated Swept Away and Revolver. The question was, how was Guy Ritchie's latest film, Rocknrolla, going to do? From what I've seen, everyone better love this movie! This film has it all: gunfights, gangsters, British slang, Gerard Butler, memorable lines, and even some poorly behaved American crayfish. Somehow, Ritchie finds enough film time to fit cameos by Jeremy Piven and Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges in there.Butler returns to the kind of the role that made him a household name in 300. Butler stars as Mr One-Two, a criminal who isn't afraid to speak out his mind, or let his fists do the talking. It's good to see Butler return to the badass role after starring in soft films such as PS I Love You and Nim's Island. Tom Wilkinson, fresh off an Oscar run in Michael Clayton, stars as Lenny Cole, a tough, old school British mobster who is prone to some senior moments. Ritchie's trademark of having the stories intertwine comes into play, something that made Snatch and Lock Stock work so well. Lenny, who has cheated One-Two out of a land deal in London, is working with some Russians, led by the businessman Yuri (Karel Roden), on a land deal. However, One-Two steals Yuri's money meant for Lenny. This sets up a chain of events which lead to dead bodies and more.While Snatch focused on a stolen diamond and Lock Stock focused on stolen guns, Rocknrolla chooses to focus on a stolen painting. You see, it's Yuri's lucky painting, and he's let Lenny borrow it. Turns out, the painting has been stolen by Lenny's wild stepson Johnny Quid (Toby Kebbell), a crazy, stoned rocker. While some fans will complain about how Ritchie films always seem to be about something stolen, I just feel if it ain't broke don't fix it! Aside from Butler and Wilkinson, fans will love performances by the all star cast including a sexy accountant (Thandie Newton), One-Two's partners (Idris Elba and Tom Hardy), and two American club owners (Bridges and Piven). However, Kebbell and Mark Strong absolutely steal the show. As the stoned rocker, Kebbell makes us feel compassion for the Johnny Quid character, and we eventually root for him against his mean ol stepdad. Strong, fresh off a classic role as a good natured hit-man in Ritchie's Revolver, portrays Archie, Lenny's loyal right hand mate. Archie is a no nonsense criminal who also serves as the voice of reason in Lenny's crazy world. Archie is without a doubt one of Ritchie's finest characters.American filmgoers will probably complain that the film is too ""British"". As an American, I honestly say, ""Who cares?"" Ritchie's use of British slang is fun, hip and gives this action film a sense of humor. If this is too much for American filmgoers, then they will be glad that this film somewhat reminds them of a film directed by the great American director Quentin Tarantino. A dance scene between Butler and Newton seems directly pulled from Pulp Fiction, a scene where Johnny tortures a man to the tune of The Subways' Rock n Roll Queen seems like a sly Reservoir Dogs reference, and the unseen painting will have fans guessing, much like the briefcase from Pulp Fiction. In addition, the opening credits sequence is on of the best you will ever see. The sequence almost has a graphic novel feel to it, something we Americans love (examples: 300, Sin City, 30 Days of Night).Overall, Ritchie gives us a deep, crazy, and fun film. When it's over, you think how this film could possibly be made better. As if right on cue, the question is answered. A sequel, The Real Rocknrolla, is announced on screen. A perfect 10, I can hardly wait for The Real Rocknrolla.",RocknRolla

Guy Ritchie's latest is crass, nihilistic, shambolic, desperate, self-indulgent, and fundamentally pointless.... and also pretty irresistible as a bit of mindless entertainment.Bits of it are lame, bits of it are reprehensible, but none of it is boring. It rattles along so briskly that there's little time to stare into the many gaping plot holes, the obligatory eclectic soundtrack impresses, and although it doesn't deserve them, it features an exceptional ensemble cast all turning in excellent performances.But it isn't all fun and games. First up, a shockingly abhorrent sequence that depicts a brutal, senseless stabbing outside a nightclub is tastelessly sexed-up to feel like both a music video, and an utterly perverse paean to maverick heroism. Secondly, the denouement is fantastically offensive; a prime example of the kind of infantile, moronic machismo that Guy Ritchie's fiercest detractors have always had a field day with. A depressive artist decides to kick his musical career to the curb in order to focus on the far more noble and righteous career of slapping people for a living?

It also featured on BBC Radio Sheffield, Leeds and York. ***The latest London gangland flick from the stable that brought us contemporary classics 'Lock, Stock, & Two Smoking Barrels' and its sequel, 'Snatch', has to work hard if it's to distance itself from 2005's much maligned 'Revolver', let alone meet the standards of its spiritual predecessors. For the uninitiated, or indeed, for anybody who's not a wheeling-dealing cockney geezer, a RocknRolla is a ""man who derives his living off the streets by using his wits and raw drive"", or, as it's put so eloquently in the film's opening credits... ""We all like a bit of the good life - some the money, some the drugs, others the sex game, the glamour, or the fame. But a RocknRolla, oh, he's different. Why? Because a real RocknRolla wants the f***ing lot"".The film focuses on a selection of London's criminal fraternity with such aspirations, as they try to get a slice of a multi million pound real estate scam set up between a Russian Mobster and old school Gangster Lenny Cole. Various shady characters, including One-two (Gerard Butler), Stella the accountant (Thandie Newton), and junkie rock-star Johnny Quid (Toby Kebbell), all try to get a piece of the action  but do any of them have what it takes to be a real RocknRolla? Ritchie's films are usually an ensemble piece, and whilst his latest is no exception, Gerard Butler's charismatic small time crook One-two is as close to a lead as the writer director has ever got. It's refreshing to have a Scot playing such a key role, and his performance is a well-balanced combination of good humoured charm and roughneck intensity. As you'd expect from 300's lead Spartan, he takes the action sequences in his stride and does a great line in testosterone fuelled banter with the rest of his crew; the 'Wild Bunch'. As Lenny Cole, Tom Wilkinson is suitably egotistical and vicious as the bad guy of the piece, but he doesn't have the smarts, the torture techniques, or mercilessness of Ritchie's other creations  particularly Snatch's Brick-top. Johnny Quid is Tyler Durden on crack, and he exhibits a cocky impudence that is further evidence that Toby Kebbell is a young actor with a very bright future. The rest of the cast forage for their moment of screen time glory to varying success. Thandie Newton is on femme fatale duty as the soulless accountant who betrays her clients for a piece of the action, she's manipulative but nowhere near as intelligent as her character would have you believe. Jeremy Piven and rapper Ludicrous are shoehorned into the plot as wiseass studio execs, and there are some caricature Russian heavies that forgo dialogue in their remorseless terminator-esquire approach to security provision.As you'd expect from Ritchie's vision of the criminal underworld, the film is infused with sickening violence and the threads of the plot eventually tie up to bring all of the misfits and mobsters together. It also has all the trademark gritty brown hues, spliced up imagery of London's skyline and fast paced editing which even extends to a sex scene that becomes 3 frames of 'wham, bam, post-coital fag Ma'am? What it doesn't have though, is the wealth of witty dialogue and convoluted plot extravagances that we've come to expect. Instead, the screenplay resorts to racist slurs and reduces pop culture references to mimicking scenes better executed in other films. In particular, the Pulp Fiction jives between One-two and Stella at a lifeless ""party"" is an unconvincing aberration that should never have made the final cut. The film has some amusing moments, but these are rarely down to the intelligence of the dialogue.RocknRolla feels like a dumbed-down, diluted take on the genre that Ritchie created with the release of Lock, Stock and the result is a parody which sacrifices many of the qualities that made the director an overnight success. It's a mishmash of unoriginal ideas that throws a great cast into a lack-lustre, feeble scenario with a script that leaves them impotent for the majority of the running time. It's not a complete lost cause  it's more consistent than Revolver and there's haphazard entertainment value to be gleaned, but Mr. Madonna needs to raise his game if he's to continue the trilogy that he's supposedly envisaged. RocknRolla is more style and substance abuse over real substance and it lacks the wit, the drive, and the aspirations that the title suggests.",RocknRolla
144,zshrj02,Excellent movie!,10,8 October 2009,"Actually, this is the comment about the movie synopsis written by...someone at IMDb, I guess. This is one of the lamest, weakest synopses I've ever read! Not only does it NOT give due credit to this quality movie, it is plainly said - weak-minded and sad. You HAVE to see the movie to understand the gravity of my claim. Well, not because I need to prove my point, no need for that, but because it well deserves to be seen. It is a great movie with excellent pace, good dialog...a tasty piece of marvelous, sweet entertainment pie. It's no ""Lock, Stock and Barrel"" simply because it needs not be one, it stands out on it's own as a long lost cousin of it.",RocknRolla

147,paragonofanimals,Déjà vu isn't always a bad thing.,8,2 October 2009,"Guy Ritchie is very good at doing two things: The first is that he's good at keeping the status quo with his films. If you've seen one of his gangster flicks(Snatch or Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels) you've seen them all. The positive thing about this is that his films are always entertaining. They still feel fresh even though he uses the same story telling and character archetypes.The second thing he's good at, is making his actors look good. You get to see actors play characters they normally wouldn't. Simply put: it's nice to see actors trying their hand at something new.RocknRolla is a very fun film, in spite of being a repeat of what Ritchie's done before. Though you may know the story and how it will end within 10 minutes of watching the film, it doesn't make it any less entertaining. If you liked Snatch or Lock, Stock then chances are you'll like this film. If you haven't seen Snatch and Lock, Stock then I'd suggest checking those out first, since they're slightly better than this one...though not by much.",RocknRolla

The painting's ""travels"" also added to the film.""RocknRolla"" didn't have the playful style and kinetic direction other Guy Ritchie movies had. Its humor wasn't even that close to that of his previous works. OK, we all like to see some motifs from a director, but Ritchie has overdone this; London criminals, Russian magnates, petty criminals... We've seen em before. He has to make something different. I also feel that it had to have some more shootouts, nothing excessive.

I didn't want to hear what the critics said, so I avoided any mention of it.I was pleasantly surprised how much fun it was. I really liked the fact there weren't many big names in it so anyone could potentially be killed.And once again, Toby Kebbell shows us what a brilliant actor he is. Only seen him in 'Dead Mans Shoes' previously, but his acting in that was astounding.All in all, really enjoyed it. It's no Snatch, but that would be a very hard film to top. There's some laughs, some tense moments and some indestructible Russians.I couldn't shake the feeling that the actor who played Archie, Mark Strong, looked very much like a young Andy Garcia!!!",RocknRolla
152,storyguide-axel,A fun little ride through the streets of London!,5,2 January 2015,"Someone is trying to make easy money, but gets screwed. However, there is always a bigger fish in the pond looking to eat the smaller fish. In this movie, lowly criminals meets councillors, junkies, dead musicians, dirty accountants, nasty crime bosses and filthy rich russians. Sounds like another movie by Guy Ritchie, more or less, and it does indeed follow the same rhythm (and theme) as Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels.The movie opens with the narrator, Archy, who breaks down the plot for us in tiny, easy-to-digest bits, and thats definitely my least favorite bit in the movie, but sadly, needed. This plot is a twisted labyrinth, that constantly shifts from one person to the next. There are no real heroes here, just fish eaten by sharks, hunted by humans, killed by... you get the point.RocknRolla has a huge cast, and some big names too. In smaller roles, you'll see names such as Tom Hardy (Handsome Bob), Jeremy Piven (Roman), Thandie Newton (Stella) and Idris Elba (Mumbles), and in the bigger, you find names like Gerard Butler (One Two), Mark Strong (Archy) and Tom Wilkinson (Lenny Cole). Most of them delivers quirky and fun characters, and some of them even gives us a bit to think about, like Tom Hardy's role, Handsome Bob, who is coming to terms with being gay.The movie is fast-paced to begin with, but slows down a bit later on. It has the obligatory violent Guy Ritchie scenes that reminds us of the early movies of Quentin Tarantino, but in the end, it is all a bit hollow. This is a movie about greed, about screwing over those with money, or even, those without.Last words... looking for a bit of solid entertainment, a good plot (not too easy to get your head around, but not too hard to loose you either) and some nice solid actors (and actresses), this is definitely the movie you are looking for.",RocknRolla
153,dazski,Decidedly Average,5,5 February 2009,"OK, lets get something straight, I really like Lock Stock & Snatch.This film however has none of charm of the previous Richie offerings.In fact this film feels more like a made for TV mini-series rather than a fully fledged movie destined for the silver screen.Individually there were some great performances  notable was Tony Kebell (who was also superb in Dead Mans Shoes) as Johnny Quid.There were some scenes that seemed to have been thrown in regardless of the damage they would do to character development  why on earth would Thandie Newton (a switched on & a naughty accountant) invite the men she tipped off to rob her client (twice) to a party she was throwing  there's loving danger and there's being stupid.The whole film needed to be tightened up, it needed some pace injected and it needed some originality  it doesn't need to be totally new, just new enough Guy!!! Don't get me wrong, I didn't hate this film, far from it, I just didn't like it that much  Guy needs to either up the ante or change the genre, simply churning out mediocre copies of his previous creations is just going to diminish the following he generated with Lock Stock & Snatch.Maybe being married to that Harpy has sucked the creativity out of him, or maybe Guy only knows how to make one type of film????

Weak disjointed story which went off at a tangent and was not remotely clever (unlike Snatch and Lock Stock); poor dialogue that was neither witty nor funny; dull characters - none of whom were interesting or convincing; exposition galore (mostly via an annoying voice over); bad acting by some of the cast, not very funny (apart from a couple of chuckles). It's a poor man's Snatch and Lock Stock (which are excellent). A lot of it made very little sense. Jeremy Piven was wasted. Terrible ending which made little or no sense, that implied the real 'hopefully' better version of the film was yet to come. Was this the rubbish version that I paid for.

155,gustafsoncarl,Carl the Critic: RocknRolla,8,10 November 2010,"Great movie! Unusual title! leave it to the British film makers to make amazing movies with strange titles. ""The Full Monty,"" ""James Bond: Octopussy,"" and of course ""RocknRolla."" What is a 'RocknRolla'? I'm not entirely sure if the film really explained it clear enough but you know this is a Guy Ritchie film, where it doesn't matter as long as the film looks good. The Formalist style of film making is clearly seen in this film with the hard core action and violence, and a scene where someone finds a creative use for a pencil (by stabbing it in someone's neck) but it is not as violent as I had hoped it to be, and since this is formalism style of film making the violence and action had to look cool as opposed to being real, which is probably why when Johnny Quid stabbed the guy in the neck like twelve times with a pencil there was no blood or markings, but really I was too busy going ""what the hell?"" to notice.The film's story was a little bit clearer than Ritchie's next film (""Sherlock Holmes"") but there is no development of the story or plot but of the characters themselves. I think that is essentially where the main story of the film is suppose to come from, and even if it didn't work for me, I still found the characters engaging and fantastic. The dialog (as always) is very witty and well executed. The lines and come backs from one actor to the next was natural and emotional, making them engaging and interesting. Like the film that follows ""Sherlock Holmes"" this film has a talented cast of well known actors as well as some promising new comers. The actors were the main reason that the film was successful for me in making me totally engaged with the film, and that I would say if you want to watch an action film with great characters, photography, editing, and a grade A British Film maker, than RocknRolla is the film for you.",RocknRolla
156,pat-pat,"Interesting film, good performances just a bit too cliché and stylistic",7,18 November 2008,"Well this is a pretty good gangster flick with some good performances especially from Tom Wilkinson and Toby Kebbell. This film is just a little too full of itself, overly stylized is one way to put it. Like it gets a bit annoying to a point in a scene where One, Two and Stella are having a conversation at a restaurant and every 5 seconds it flashes back to where One, Two and the wild bunch are stealing a briefcase from two guys while it goes back to him telling Stella about the jacking. This flashes back a forth about 7 times and like I said quite annoying. Random slow motion walks are also incorporated which seems like its been too over used in movies over the years. I know im not the only one who seen similarities between this film and and Pulp Fiction but the most striking thing that I cant believe they didn't leave on the cutting room floor was a scene where the same two men I talked about earlier are about to rape one, two and just in time an entourage of Lenny's men walk in just before the deed is done. But don't get me wrong this is a pretty good movie Toby Kebbell stole the show with his perfect depiction of hardcore drug addict. Fantastic actor Tom Wilkinson is also great in yet another film thanks to his comic wit. Its even pretty damn funny at some moments. This is a good, entertaining film with believable performances that will surely hold your interest through its runtime. 7 out of 10",RocknRolla

I went to see this in good faith - it looked like a riot. It wasn't. It was dreary as hell. Self-indulgent, pointless, virtually plot less, and at 114 minutes, about 30 minutes too long. It drags. And it's a drag. The problem with Guy Richkid is he has got nothing to lose - and he has no edge. He is making 'street' films from his ivory tower without the first clue as to what is going on - so this comes across like some kind of Long Good Friday for Nuts readers - his jumpy editing style now woefully dated, and the soundtrack showing all the signs of a middle-aged hipster choosing some funky tracks. It's three strikes you're out Rich-kid. He rolls out the hoary old Russian gangsters who won't die routine; worthless US actor cameos; and the limp attempts at profundity (check the Toby Kebbel character's piano-side monologue) go nowhere; the homo-eroticism seems misplaced; as does a cringe-worthy scene with a kid defiantly singing the Clash. It's a bloody mess; an embarrassment. And laughingly, the end credits suggest the characters will return in 'The Real Rocknrolla' (as opposed to what, this, the fake one?). No they bloody won't. Warners US have unceremoniously dumped this movie, and it is no surprise. It is dull and bemusing. Avoid like the proverbial.",RocknRolla

This is its first mistake, not because I insist on getting the same actors, but because he seems to have done a much better job in the past. All of the characters seemed to be written to have some personality, but many either didn't have enough screen time or weren't cast well enough to be as compelling as the past installments. As a result, I only ended up rooting for one character of the bunch, possibly because he was the narrator.

It doesn't. As I said in the title it is fine as a film but compare it to the first two and the gaps and lack of quality are there to see. Negatives: A lot of the acting is awful with Lenny being the worst of the bunch. You never find yourself being adsorbed into the characters because the accents or ability of the actors lacks credibility. There is not enough depth with the main characters and because you never spend quite enough time with them you don't really care. The genius photography and style found in LS is only here in parts with most of the scenes composed with a lack of care - a travesty that Richie would never have done in LS or Snatch. The music, anther Richie trademark, although good does not seem to match the scenes. Lastly, the story is not as adventurous as it could be. There was a great opportunity for a twisting tale of irony (Len not seeing his own tactics being used by a bigger fish)and back stabbing which ended up being relatively pedestrian. There is no linking of story threads at the end and a few of the threads don't even finish (have to wait for No2 to see if this was deliberate). Positives: There are exquisite moments though, particularly with the Russians who were superb actors all round. The budget and quality of the film was high and the editing was of a high standard. The other highlight was John, he did a superb job and I would not be surprised to see his career skyrocket because he has stacks of ability. Overall, I did like it despite the limitations of the script and some dreadful performances (Len).

168,RJR99SS,"Good, but lacking surprises",7,14 May 2009,"""RocknRolla"" takes Guy Ritchie back to his famous ""Gangsta"" style movies that started off his movie career. There's no secret that this one is essentially the same as the last two. Just as ""Snatch"" was good but not as good as ""Lock, Stock and two smoking barrels"", ""RocknRolla"" is good but isn't as good as ""Snatch"".Pretty much everything is the same as the last two, lots of the same characters, and basically the same plot. You have the good natured gang of likable buddy criminals, who of course only harm or steal from criminals worse than them. There's the super-bad crime boss, who controls his little niche in town, but ends up losing everything at the end. There's the highly valuable artifact that seems to have a mind of it's own, switching hands numerous times, and everyone in the film seems to be looking for at one point or another (The only new twist is that the artifact is introduced almost cartoonishly by a character proclaiming it's his favorite thing in the world, he sure would be mad if it went missing, but then freely lets someone he barely even knows borrow it, warning him to make sure he gets it back. I'd like to think this was maybe a little bit of sarcasm on Ritchie's part, for fans familiar with his movies, but i don't know). There's the hero, the leader of the good guy criminals, his adventures go awry, and the promise of big money turns into the certainty of death, but naturally he always comes out on top and in better shape than he could of possibly dreamed. Of course, there's the pivotal location where several outlaw sects are led to through their own independent actions, all arriving there at the exact same time so they can have a shootout, and only one gang emerges.I could go on, but there's no need. Fans of the previous films can just guess what kind of characters, plot, and action they'll see, and they'll be pretty accurate. There's a few characters who show up that we haven't seen before, most notably the ""RocknRolla"" character the film is named after: a musician drug addict/philosopher, who thinks (Like most romantic junky characters) that he has everything all figured out. The only twist is that maybe he actually does.Many of the characters aren't very interesting unfortunately, and some are simply put in to advance the plot, with no other real purpose. I feel they could of cut down on a lot of characters because they confuse things, or better yet: flesh them out more.Ritchie's gangsta films are notorious for their quick and dirty action sequences, but this film takes somewhat of a break from that in introducing an all out, extended car chase/fight sequence straight out of Hollywood summer blockbusters. I somewhat despise the whole action genre, but Ritchie makes it refreshing this time around. The whole sequence is unbelievable, and over-the-top, but it's enjoyable to watch as the involved characters cant believe what is happening either.It's a good film, but we've seen it before, and there's no big surprises anywhere. After three films, i really would like to see the big-dollar crime boss (who always seems to be the most interesting character) actually win. Or maybe have the good guy gang actually have to face the music for their criminal actions. My hopes for the latter were dashed here when, interestingly enough, in this one it becomes clear that there's been an informant who has sent several of the good guy gang to jail at one point, when he is found out...they don't blame themselves for committing these crimes, rather they blame the informant for sending them to jail. But...that's the charm of a Guy Ritchie Movie.This film ends with something of a promise to expect the same characters (sans the many dead ones of course), to be back in a sequel. Seems odd to make a sequel of this particular one, as i personally found all the characters in this to be the least interesting out of all the films. Plus all three gangsta films are so similar, you may as well consider them to be a trilogy, and it seems out of place to make a sub-branch of one or the other.All in all, it would probably be considered an excellent film by people not familiar with the previous ones, but fans of the other movies may feel it lacking, and a little redundant. I really do hope to see something with a new twist in the future, i think three really is the magic number of times you can get away with making the same film, no matter how entertaining the pattern it is.",RocknRolla
169,MorganGrodecki,If this movie's rockin',9,14 October 2008,"Throughout his career, director Guy Ritchie (Snatch, Lock Stock and two Smokin' Barrels) has slowly gathered a cult-like following, ensuring that his movies, be they good or bad, will always earn a few dollars from loyal fans. With his 2006 release of Revolver, many of his avid followers found new 'stylistic' directors to drool over, the movie itself receiving mostly negative reviews as a majority of moviegoers claimed it to be 'all style and no substance'. His latest release, RocknRolla, shows Ritchie returning to his roots of gangster oriented, moronic villain centered, hit-man featuring fun. It's a welcome return.RocknRolla is an ensemble piece, centering on many, many characters while remaining surprisingly capable of not focusing on any one member of the never-ending cast. Gerard Butler (300) plays a good-hearted crook for hire by the name of One-Two, a member in a group of 5 blood-to-bones friends, each of which doubles as a partner in crime. The main focus in the gangster-related circle of characters is Lenny Cole, a ruthless, old fashioned thug brought to life by Oscar-nominated Tom Wilkinson (Michael Clayton).The movie truly begins 15 minutes or so after the rather unique opening credits, which in itself foreshadows Ritchie's stylistic thematic which circulates throughout the movie. The eclectically charged plot follows Lenny Cole and his cohorts as they meet and greet Uri, a seemingly reasonable Russian mobster, as the two speak real-estate business. Cole, a self-proclaimed ""King of London"", runs each and every aspect of London, and agrees to allow the Russians their building  for a small sum of 7 million Euros. Agreeing, Uri offers Lenny his favourite painting as a token of appreciation, a hopeful symbol that all will go well.From this point on, viewers are treated to a mishmash of confusing twists, an infinite pallet of characters, and some of the most intelligent writing to hit Hollywood in years. The afore-mentioned painting is stolen from Cole, and a search ensues throughout the entire movie, eventually leading to Johnny Quid (Jamie Campbell), the lead singer of The Quidlickers, and step-son to none other than Lenny himself. Quid, also known as ""The Rocknrolla"", represents a solid contrast to his devilish step-father. Providing monologue after brilliant monologue, Quid becomes a character of classic cool, embodying olden day suave with modern day style, a true to time Rocknrolla.As with every one of Ritchie's gifts to the silver screen, the subtle yet slick script throws the few negative aspects of the movie to the backburner, leaving only pure gold to shimmer and shine. With a never ending stream of British mannerisms combined with over-seas terminology, North American viewers are faced with a rather tricky dilemma: Sit through a movie that may require a small amount of effort to comprehend due to it's foreign tendencies, or instead rely on Dicaprio and Mr. Crowe to deliver yet another bland, meaningless CIA centered action movie in the form of now premiering Body Of Lies. Unfortunately for the masses that truly enjoy a movie with an intelligent script, box office numbers generally speak poorly for Guy Ritchie's films on our side of the pond, his movies usually making no more than a few hundred thousand dollars, only to become cult hits once released on DVD.Viewers may be shocked to see Gerard Butler (best known for his overly masculine performance as King Leonidas in 300) hidden amongst an amazing yet unknown cast, with each actor holding their own and providing more than authentic performances. It is a rare yet beautiful sight to behold, a cast full of actors that have not yet been granted the ""fame"" or spotlight, yet manage to upstage a majority of the actors that we are presented on a day to day basis. It is beyond sad, the least can be said, to see Chris Bridges  A.K.A. Ludicrous (2 Fast 2 Furious)  and Jeremey Pivens (Smokin' Aces) failing miserably in their attempt to act in brief yet important cameo performances, also singled out as the only two American actors in the film, their ""talent"" shadowed and overcast by the nobodies surrounding them.To those readers out there who are contemplating seeing this not-quite-so-common piece of theatre in the form of British Cinema, it is best for you to know there are many worse things you can do. Director Guy Ritchie weaves an intricate quilt the likes of which hasn't been since his debut to theatres, managing to create a truly witty film from nothing more than a missing painting. Definitely a must see.5 out of 5 stars",RocknRolla
170,lglagro,"Welcome back, Guy.",10,25 October 2008,"I just saw this film and I obviously loved it. I had been a huge fan of Guy Richie's ""Snatch"" and ""Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels."" Then he married Madonna and made a few bum movies, especially ""Revolver."" Well rest easy, Guy Richie Fans, the man who made the two great movies I listed above is back and funnier, more intense, and a better writer/director than ever. The first ten or twenty minutes of the movie are a little confusing, but as long as you follow the characters and events (which isn't hard to do since they're fantastic and well acted) you'll understand and enjoy ""RocknRolla"". I'll also add that the soundtrack is great.",RocknRolla
171,tazwell,Overall a pretty good movie!,7,16 February 2009,"While the movie starts out a little slow, it rapidly picks up the pace. I wasn't sure how I was going to feel about this movie, but I was pleasantly surprised! Drugs, guns, mobsters, and all the other things you have come to expect (and love!) in a Guy Ritchie film are included. The plot is funny yet violent, with an eclectic mix of characters to keep things interesting. I especially liked the 'Chechen' mobsters, and the scenes featuring them are very funny. Without giving anything away, there was one small plot inclusion that in my mind was unnecessary, and I think should have been left out. While I liked Snatch better, RocknRolla is sure to entertain. 7 out of 10 stars.",RocknRolla

I had always thought he was a great actor so I figured I would watch some of his lesser known films. I was surprised by how well the story was written and the cast was simply amazing. Thandie Newton and Gerard Butlers interaction is believable as a ""couple"". The rest of the cast interact like they had been friends for years prior to making RockNRolla. The film introduced me to Tom Hardy, Idris Elba, Toby Kebbell just to name a few of Hollywood current major stars. Guy Ritchie did another outstanding job on this on in line with Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and Snatch. Do not miss this movie. You would do well to search out Tom Hardys. And Mark Strongs earlier films.",RocknRolla
173,milofromtheblock,Ritchie's return to old form... and old characters and plots,7,5 September 2008,"RocknRolla is a return to the familiar territory of Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and Snatch for director Guy Ritchie and reminds us why he was hailed as such a talent at the time of their release. No one can write a sprawling tongue in cheek cockney gangland tale like Ritchie and his talent for writing ultra masculine, tough talking and worldly wise gangsters has always grabbed attention. That being said, Rocknrolla isn't up the heights of the his earlier efforts and finds the pace markedly slowed, not that it could be called slow by the measure of any other director. This time round Ritchie suffers from the sheer weight of a genre that he helped to create, with few of the characters going beyond the one note gangsters that populated a million poor attempts to copy the Lock, Stock magic.As usual with Ritchie, the plot is too convoluted to really explain but essentially there is a classic old school London gangster (Tom Wilkinson), a Russian businessman with big money, a stolen lucky painting and a 7 million euro land deal that all contrive to revolve around our nominal heroes, low level criminals One Two (Gerard Butler) and Mumbles (Idris Elba). The plot is episodic and meandering but that's no bad thing as Ritchie has a talent for well written small roles that flesh out a vibrant underground world of chancers, junkies, dealers, record producers and... accountants.This rigid structure of fleeting performances suggests that Ritchie is hiding as a filmmaker, throwing visual stunts and mockney dialogue at us in the hope we don't look too carefully at his characters. This is a shame because in this film he writes one of the best characters of his career, Johnny Quid, the Rocknrolla of the title. Played by Toby Kebbell, Johnny Quid is a junkie rock star full to the brim with charisma, talent and threat. Kebbell swings wildly from manically engaging, to terrifyingly threatening and back to philosophical and enigmatic. While a fantastic scene, in which he explains life through the medium of a cigarette packet, is cinematic posturing, at the scene's heart lies talented writing and a perfectly played junkie dreamer.Overall the film has its moments but never attains the freshness and style that made Ritchie's debut and his follow up such fascinating films. The story itself starts off well but draws towards a disappointingly predictable denouement and perhaps demonstrates a filmmaker trying to recapture old magic rather than make a new unique movie.",RocknRolla
174,chimpiki,"Like Tim Burton's ""Planet of the Apes,"" There Won't be a Sequel to Explain This Crap.",1,7 April 2009,"It's been a long time since I've seen a film with no redeeming qualities, but ""RocknRolla"" is one of them. I would warn about spoilers, except I honestly don't know that there's anything I can spoil. Here we have a film that tries to be both ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""The Departed,"" but a writer/director who is too far up himself to hear the absurdity of the dialogue, or to fix the over-complexities to a simplistic plot with an underwhelming climax. It's an ensemble piece, but the actors fail to mesmerize, and the characters fall short of memorable. Rather than aiding the narrative, the brief moments of non-linear storytelling tend to drag it rather than aid it. Now, I'm a moviegoer who is willing to forgive a weak script provided there are moments of intense action. I'm also a moviegoer who can thoroughly enjoy a well-acted, thought provoking film without a single special effect or action sequence to speak of. However, ""RocknRolla"" contains mediocre acting, mediocre action, horrendous dialogue, a terribly pompous script, and uninspired direction.The way this film is structured, I wouldn't be surprised if Guy Ritchie fancies himself as the English Tarantino or Paul Thomas Anderson; after all, the massive amount of characters and subplots are both reminiscent of the aforementioned writer/directors. Having said that, at the end of the day, all of these things need to come together in the final act. While in a way they do in ""RocknRolla,"" there are several plot elements that are far from being necessary, which leaves the viewer asking themselves ""what the hell?""All throughout the dialogue is painful, and the actors fail to strengthen it for the most part. Even though I giggled at some moments, those moments were hardly worth the time and effort spent watching the movie. I spent much more time rolling my eyes and trying to wrap my mind around the excruciatingly overcomplicated and scatterbrain plot.Coming in at just under two hours, ""RocknRolla"" felt much more like three and a half. By the time I hit the halfway mark, I didn't care if I ever found out where the plot went, I just wanted it to end, and for all the characters to die together in an apocalyptic meltdown of some sort. What made everything worse is during the end credits, when the promise of a sequel is made. If the studios have any common sense, they will scrap anything with ""RocknRolla"" in the title from here on out. And as for you, I sincerely hope that you take my advice and avoid this movie.",RocknRolla
175,jackmoss88,"Yeah, we've seen it all before, but...",8,6 September 2008,"I have to admit that I have a soft spot for Guy Ritchie's mockney gangster films. I don't know what it is. I know that they're not very profound and have nothing to say, I know that they're a pure fantasy vision of British crime and I know that if you've seen Lock Stock, you've pretty much seen them all. And yet, as Ritchie returns for a third iteration of the only formula with which he's tasted success , I still find myself walking out of the cinema massively entertained.RocknRolla does absolutely nothing new. A quick list of things it shares with Lock Stock and Snatch would read thus: fast paced, witty dialogue; complex, interwoven plot threads; central McGuffin driving the mayhem (#1 antique shotguns, #2 huge diamond, #3 a lucky painting); smart, rapid editing; a mountain of Cockney crime stereotypes. Even things such as hard-as-nails Russian henchmen return. It completes the upward curve of scale in Ritchie's crime films: from a rigged card game to a rigged boxing circuit to rigged property development. The crime lords get larger in stature, the sums of money owed have more zeros on the end and the capers required to resolve the situation more grand, but it's still the same concept.You'd think this was a list of criticisms, and if you found Snatch wearingly familiar you shouldn't need it spelling out that this film won't impress you. Looking for originality? Look elsewhere. RocknRolla may be pushing the formula a little bit, but if you accept that it's still enormous fun. Ritchie's directing is as proficient as ever, it moves at a merry old pace and the plot just about stays on the rails. The characters are endearing and there's plenty of laughs to be had. Other than its dearth of invention, the only real flaw with the film lies in the opening fifteen minutes, where Ritchie sets up the plot strands which will then unravel. Whereas previous films did this in a smooth, unforced way, here Ritchie lathers it with a liberal helping of voice-over narration so there's absolutely no confusion possible as to who is who and what they're after, which on many occasions extends to pointing out the bleeding obvious. Show don't tell- it's the first rule in the book Ritchie! It may be getting to the point where RocknRolla must go down as a guilty pleasure, but guilty pleasures are often the most fulfilling kind. And so it is here.",RocknRolla
176,killa_man23,Convoluted is all I can say,6,22 September 2008,"Like many people who've watched Lock, Stock & 2 Smoking Barrels, Snatch and to a lesser extent Revolver, I went into the theater expecting old-school Ritchie with wit and far-fetched and lovable character. I didn't manage to witness the former, and the latter falls into question. To call it a story would be wrong of me because I can't find it. There's really no linear plot. What is seen as just a simple caper at the beginning turns into a mirage of sub-plots that will leave you guessing why was it there in the first place.The story revolves around a painting (which is never actually shown in its entirety throughout the movie) and how it falls into the hands of London's leading underground kingpin. What is given to him as a gift by a wealthy but shady Russian character called Yuri soon becomes the attention of the entire London underground. Throw in some 7 million dollars into the mix and you have yourself a convoluted caper that draws into a contrived conclusion that showcases the kingpin as an informant.I can't begin to explain the film as it has perplexed me with its unresolved plot and useless sub plots that disappear as quickly as it emerges. The only thing praise-worthy are the Guy Ricthie-esquire characters. In the end, RocknRolla is nothing more than a movie you watch and munch popcorn to and laugh at certain moments without following a plot - which is clearly not given.6/10",RocknRolla

178,darrenforster99,Great film...,10,10 October 2008,"Just went to see this film in the cinema on Tuesday. What a really good film, I haven't watched any of the other films like Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels as the advertising for them was a bit poor. But RocknRolla sounded really interesting. I tried numerous times to ask my mate to come with me but instead on that night we decided to go and see Tropical Thunder, the main reason for that choice was that the cinema in Warrington was only showing RocknRolla at 21.50 which was a bit late to go and watch a film. I ended up going to see RocknRolla in Cheshire Oaks and it was superb, far better than Tropical Thunder (well it wouldn't have took much!) Anyway I have a question about the film I wonder if anyone can answer, it also has a bit of a spoiler in it.In the movie when One-Two goes to see Tank, Tank is sat in the car watching a DVD commenting on how good the remake of the film is on DVD. Does anyone know is that a genuine movie or is it just a random bit of acting they've stuck in there? and if it is a genuine movie which one is it?",RocknRolla
179,popcorncharlie,Sadly disappointing....,6,4 November 2008,"I loved Lock Stock and Layer Cake (Directed by Matthew Vaughn), and even more so Snatch, so was really looking forward to rocknrolla, whilst trying to ignore the last couple of Guy's movies...rocknrolla is essentially Lock Stock for the first half, then Layer Cake for the second half. The only really entertaining scenes come right in the middle of the movie. The cast is great, most of the characters are very good, and some of the filming and editing is very clever. However it all feels a bit lazy, the script and plot are just a rushed rehash of Lock Stock and Layer Cake, some of the characters and ""twists"" are just there to fill in and make no sense, and add nothing, and ultimately if you are a fan of this genre of film you will feel let down.A shame for the public, and a shame for the good cast, I think!If you haven't seen Lock Stock or Layer Cake, you'll probably enjoy it more!!!",RocknRolla
180,petter-f,very good. definitely worth watching.,7,11 January 2009,"yes!!! guy ritchie does it again. he makes yet another great movie. the mixture between British humor, gangsters and action is almost a perfect combination. if i where to compare it to snatch and lock stock, i would say that snatch is better, and lock stock is about equal to rocknrolla. the way the different characters stories cross each other is as usual fun and entertaining, with a lot of twists and turns. rocknrolla is more an action/drama movie, then a comedy. the humor is there, in a lot of the varius situations, but it is not as funny as in snatch and lock stock. it seems like guy ritchie tried to make a more serius movie, with more serius characters and situations, with a touch of comedy. all in all it's a good mix, and a movie definitely worth watching.",RocknRolla

Do some people actually expect anything else than the stereo-types portrayed here when they go watch a Guy Ritchie movie??? Come on, I loved the Russian hit men, so funny. Of course this doesn't reach the level of Snatch and Lock, Stock but seeing as he was married to Madonna maybe he needs some time to get back up, and he's almost there. Do all Directors just go up in quality like someone here said, no, of course not look at Spielberg to name but one and this is not a bad movie, it just isn't. Some very nice characters, especially Archie and compared to much of the crap coming out of Hollywood these days I'd go for a movie like this anyday.

182,ajbzerosignal84,Another major miss-fire from Guy Ritchie,4,10 September 2008,"Early previews has called this a return to form. Hardly. This was for me, a major disappointment. The moment the film begins, its as if it intentionally tries to confuse us as to what the hell this film's all about. Describing the plot is close to pointless. After all, Guy Ritchie isn't adept in the old art of storytelling, his films ran along the lines of sitcoms - a series of events instead of an actual story. Which wasn't a bad thing in the case of Lock, Stock & Snatch because emotional resonance with the audience was irrelevant. The goal there was to generate laughter. But RocknRolla is only funny in minor - and I DO mean minor - spots. What's more, it also doesn't help as it begins: of how it mentions that Britain is on the up in the property market. Seeing as of now the country is currently enduring credit-crunch problems, inflation rises and a major decrease in property value. You'd be surprised how automatically dated this makes the film.Its unfair to judge a new film based on the director's previous efforts, but when its Guy Ritchie - who's been running on the same formula for the past 10 years - you can't help but do so. This film was advertised and touted as a return to form ala Lock, Stock and Snatch, but after the first time I watched those two, I loved them. Not looked at them with total scorn. The moments of humour and wit is few and far between, and some lines of dialogue and monologues try to add a little swagger but come off as pretentious and are inches away from falling into self-parody and returning to Revolver territory. And when the best laughs this film can generate involves around a character's homosexuality, you know this film is headed for the pits. The performances here are strong, but it still doesn't account for the dialogue which just goes nowhere. The entire persona of Tom Wilkinson's cockney villain is almost entirely derived from Bob Hoskins in the Long Good Friday and Tony Kebbell's ""Johnny Quid"" (the RocknRolla of the film's title) is pretty much a totally pointless character - honestly, did this guy have any purpose in this film other than that he stole the painting? > No. In the end it doesn't help when the film's excuse for a plot is merely a bunch of distractions to hide what is really - a completely mediocre film. Its so convoluted anyway, its virtually nonsense. Unlike Lock, Stock and Snatch, where all the characters and their situations are established, in this film they're not and it finishes with too many loose ends and plot holes, and contrivances. - What actually happened to Thandie Newton and the Russian with that painting? - Where did the whole Lenny's frame up of the characters come from then? - Will all this be revealed in Ricthie's intended sequel? Who knows? And who cares? Because if that were the case, the best described feeling that this would generate would be that you were cheated.Guy Ritchie's flashy hyper-kinetic style is what keeps this film from being a total bore, but now's the time where he should stop writing scripts.",RocknRolla

184,sportybeepbeep,Feed it to the Crayfish,3,27 May 2016,"It's not that I don't appreciate some of the work of Guy Ritchie. He had a nice start with Lock Stock And Two Smoking Barrels. And both Sherlock Holmes movies present an interesting twist on a famous character. Although I suspect the latter is more due to Robert Downey Jr.'s immense talent. Problem is, when he did Lock Stock..., it seemed like a harmless comedy. A bit of fun and capers at the expense of what Guy assumes is the ""gangster lifestyle"". After watching RockNRolla, you begin to suspect that this guy secretly wishes to have an army of Vinnie Joneses and Mark Strongs roughing up anyone who dares stand in his path of domination.All the ingredients are in place. You have the old time cockney crime boss, played by Tom Wilkinson, and his trusted right hand man and enforcer, played by Mark Strong. You have Gerard Butler, Idris Elba and Tom Hardy as the small time crooks who call themselves The Wild Bunch. You have a Russian businessman/gangster wanting to invest in London property, and has no qualms in showing guys like Wilkinson that times have changed, and that they are no match for those yielding his type of power and money. Add a junkie rock and roll star (Toby Kebbell), playing another anachronistic Guy Ritchie fantasy. The Russians' accountant (Thandie Newton) who backstabs him thanks to her connections to The Wild Bunch, some enforcers, two American music promoters, and all you have to do is shake, stir them all together somehow, and you have another cocktail of ""hilarious consequences"", and someone's idea of glamorous/ruthless crime life ready to serve.Sure, there is a plot involving a stolen painting. And a final twist where it turns out Tom Wilkinson is a police informer, resulting in death by crayfish at the hands of Mark Strong. But it all seems to take a backseat to a lot of jump cuts, exposition, violence, and attempts at humorous, witty quips. The people we care about don't get that honor because we like the cartoonish characters. Just cause we like the actors. Mark Strong is a menacing, strong presence, like he was in the first Sherlock Holmes. And Idris Elba is genuine class. Other than that, there are too many clichés, like Wilkinson. And Gerard Butler is a Poseur of the highest order (of course he has a sex scene with Newton that you can spot a mile away). Not to mention Toby Kebbell, as an insufferable, self-obsessed, profound statement spouting brat, who needed his tongue ripped out with red hot pliers.In the end, you might think there is a hidden sub-plot/morality tale about criminal money being used to hike up the price of properties in London, and pricing other residents out. Or you would, if that was given more than 30 seconds at the start of the film. What you end up getting is a glimpse into someone else's adolescent fascination. Which, frankly, could do with a little dose of subtlety, taste, and proper characterization.",RocknRolla

186,Kee_Nim_Mak_Mak,More diamond geezer than old pony... but only just,7,11 September 2008,"Meanwhile back in Cock-a-nee Land a gang of lovable rogues have stumbled into the schemes of Mr Big. A valuable item has gone missing, some shady characters are in on the scene and things are rapidly going the way of the Tom Tit. Although, of course, we can rely on our a-moral heroes to make the best of a bad situation with nothing but their native banter and a generous serving of farcical luck, to leave with the cash and the booty with enough time left for a sly wink at the camera and a gleeful swagger off into the sunset.See, the thing with a Guy Ritchie film is that in reviewing one, you are essentially reviewing them all (with the exceptions of the overblown 'Revolver' and the less-said-the-better 'Swept Away'). For those who enjoyed 'Lock, Stock...' and 'Snatch,' 'Rocknrolla' will be instantly familiar. Substitute antique guns/diamonds for a 'lucky painting,' substitute backroom gambling/illegal boxing for the darker side of the music industry. In some ways Ritchie is an auteur - he's hit on a unique style and a familiar formula and he's taking it to new and interesting places. In other ways he's a tired hack peddling the same film three times. You'll know already which side of the fence you're on and Rocknrolla isn't about to change your mind.For what it's worth, Rocknrolla is another ensemble piece, a complicated, multi-tiered farce linking Tom Wilkinson's ruthless property don, an Abramovich-esquire Russian businessman , a burnt-out rock star, a femme-fatale accountant and a group of guns-for-hire known as The Wild Bunch together through the theft of the Russian's lucky painting, and the coincidences and mishaps that befall each of them. Yes. A bit like 'Snatch.' And, yes, a bit like 'Lock, Stock...' Any signs that Ritchie has matured as a director in the ten years since 'Lock, Stock...' are few and far between, but you get the impression that he's not too interested in maturing anyway. 'Revolver' felt stilted and over-ambitious - 'Rocknrolla' plays out with confidence and an undeniable sense of fun. This is what Ritchie's good at - like Tarantino and Scorcese, he flounders out of his own pond, but in it there are few who can top him.Though it would be unfair to say that 'Rocknrolla' displays no signs of Ritchie attempting something new. Perhaps the most notable difference this time around is the edge of poignancy to certain scenes - Johnny Quid's background story makes him one of the most sympathetic and arguably best anti-heroes in a Ritchie film yet, a victim of a neglected childhood and an abusive father who turns to music and drugs for escape. Hackneyed, but it's practically Shakesperean compared to Snatch's cardboard cut-outs. Then there's the funny-yet-strangely-touching relationship between Gerrard Butler's 'likeable' oaf One-Two and best friend/closet homosexual 'Handsome' Bob - played for cheap laughs, but the scene in which Butler accepts his friends 'lifestyle choice' is one of the most touching in the film and a surprisingly rare moment of compassion from a Guy Ritchie film.No-one's going to mistake Rocknrolla for a work of cinematic genius, but in a summer where we've seen the blockbuster elevated to the status of mature cinema with the likes of The Dark Knight, it's refreshing for a film to be so unashamedly, unthinkingly entertaining. Anyone seeking two hours of pure honest thrills could do a lot worse than to check it out.",RocknRolla

This movie is nothing but a cheap rehash of the brilliant Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. Right down to the idea of a novelty item being much sought after and exchanging hands in the most strange circumstances.

The cast aren't the most famous, in fact I have not seen many of them in anything else, but all play their parts well. You find yourself laughing in parts, as there is some humour.

190,locked_in_the_attic,"Don't be hasty, stay in your seat!",7,6 September 2008,"(Mild spoilers only) I watched this with the low to average expectations a Guy Ritchie film generally provokes, and for the first act I got exactly what I expected. Jelly-moulded Ritchie characters, half the dialogue falling flat (""Only if he's wicked"" - You'll see what I mean), and some slightly dodgy performances. But I persevered, waiting for the return of the rock star from the mildly intriguing opening scene, and I'm glad I did. As soon as the missing presumed dead Johnny Quid is properly introduced (a smackhead in a filthy drug den) the film powers forward at a break-neck pace. This is wholly down to Toby Kebbell's more-than-standout performance as the cocky rocker. His swaggering confidence and absolute refusal to be intimidated (he is bossman Lenny's step son) turns several of the already established characters on their heads and provides the cockney comedy I was waiting for. The elevator scene where Quid predicts how his aggressors are going to kill him is priceless. And of course it doesn't hurt that the inventive scenes of violence are all his. Check out the vicious pencil stabbing! The satisfying climax (before the groan inducing 'there's gonna be a sequel' final scene) involves the double-crossing twists you'd expect from a film of this type, providing nothing new or shocking but wrapping it all up nicely. If you're a Ritchie fan, you'll love it, I think it's probably his best. I guess my main problem was how formulaic it all was. It seems Mr. Madonna, unsure where to tread after Revolver's mixed (but generally negative) reception, decided to play it safe by returning to the template of his first two films. This however just makes it seem that progression is not priority for the director, and it all seems like (excuse my ignorance here) how I imagine American audiences might think of a typical Brit-flick. Were it not for Toby Kebbell and, to be fair, the writing of his character, RocknRolla would have been painfully mediocre.",RocknRolla
191,slimboyjordan,Guy Ritchies back with a big Rock n Roll Bang!,9,6 September 2008,"Having seen both revolver and the drab trailer for this film I was less than excited when i was invited to see this at the cinema, but I was seduced by the notion that this was the guy who made Snatch and Lockstock.I was completely blown away by the amazing soundtrack(a must own), brilliant acting, fantastic storyline and extremely accurate outlook on modern day London. This certainly is a return to form for Guy Ritchie with a film that will certainly be a worthy addition to my film collection.Im spoiling nothing by telling you that when the credits roll(no pun intended) its announced that there will be a sequel called 'The Real RocknRolla' although I have to admit I'm not overly excited, I feel that equilibrium was restored at the end of the film. But on the back of this I'm definitely going to see it.",RocknRolla
192,pinho-1,"Didn't want my money back, but...",5,5 September 2008,"Guy Richie's flicks seem to be establishing their own category or even brand, like clothes or cars. But let's make it straight: it's not Armani and Bentley. It's Gap and Volkswagen. They're Guy Richie's films. Solid, fairly respected make, guarantying particular quality and style in every aspect of it. They're colourful and good-looking, but they're made of exactly the same materials. They won't bore you, but they won't surprise you just as surely. They're tasty but they aren't fresh. Of course, just like Gap and Volkswagen with their fans, Guy Richie won't disappoint his admirers with 'Rocknrolla'. Also, there do exist some bright aspects of this movie, like fantastic Tom Wilkinson's character, uber-yummie Thandie Newton as dodgy accountant and her blitz sex scene. However, and even though I wasn't expecting much more than solid entertainment I can't help the feeling of certain under-indulgence. The style of old Richie's films' dialogues stayed, so what if the wit and spark are gone. The pace is as fast as it was but you know exactly how's it going to end. That all is just solid, only moderately funny and not much more.",RocknRolla

I rented it because Blockbuster labeled it as a ' hidden gem'. Plus, I'm really into Gerard Butler. I think he's an awesome actor and really hot. But even he wasn't enough to make me want to continue the movie. I couldn't even understand what they were saying half the time because the accents were so thick, and I had no idea what was going on. This movie wasn't for me, but that's not to say that other people won't like it. If I liked anything about what I did see of the movie, it was the music, and Gerard Butler. ;)",RocknRolla

This movie proves without a doubt that Guy Ritchie is a one-trick pony, someone who got lucky with his first movie and is doomed to forever rip it off for anything else he makes.Guy Ritchie is so far removed from the gangster lifestyle he attempts to portray its laughable. Everything seems so hackneyed and clichéd, the script is as close to Lock Stock and Two Smokings barrels as you could get without actually making the same film. The dialogue, choice of music editing, everything seems so forced, so desperately trying to be hip its pathetic. A truly terrible film.",RocknRolla

196,duncan-160,One-trick pony retches up another steaming pile of celluloid dung,2,11 September 2008,"Would somebody PLEASE stop Guy Ritchie from writing scripts like a 15 year old public schoolboy living out some ridiculous nefarious fantasies. I cannot believe that anyone can see this film as anything other than what it is - a stream of Guy Ritchie consciousness packaged up with a load of bad language, embarrassing dialogue, two-dimensional characters you couldn't care less about and utterly utterly stupid plot - at least this time he's not trying to make it look like a Bacardi Breezer commercial - and for that I give it one more star! As if to justify some kind of scriptwriter credentials he makes almost every single major character (of which there are many) take turns to spout half-baked philosophical claptrap as if it would give this UTTER RUBBISH some kind of value: ""See that fag packet over there.....it's like life....."" WHHAAAT? I cringed through most of this film listening to this nonsense; by the end I was actually feeling sorry for Ritchie for actually believing that he had some kind of talent as a writer. I enjoyed ""Lock, Stock..."" and ""Snatch"" but by the end of that film I was saying, 'yes, very clever, but enough now thank you.' After the diabolical ""Swept Away"" and unwatchable ""Revolver"" it appears that otherwise perfectly logical people seem desperate to put him back on his pedestal as 'The British Tarentino' (which he isn't, and never will be) - so much so that they are prepared to swallow anything slightly better than those two films - which it is...but only slightly.To his credit, however, the direction is more assured and less reliant on gimmicks and the one short action scene (when it finally gets going after being irritatingly inter-cut by some (more) talking nonsense) is tremendously enjoyable. The cast is great but the acting is extremely mercurial. And, sorry but what was that gay subplot all about? Is Ritchie trying to engage a new audience or something? When it's conducted with the subtlety of an elephant on a waltzer (was that the Blue Oyster Bar from Police Academy?) I can't imagine too many converts - clumsy, crass, unfunny, pointless, offensive and just plain stupid - just like this film.As I was watching this film I was thinking, 'If you are going to make me listen to this crud for two hours then at least give me something entertaining to look at'; I actually yearned for the visuals of Ritchie's first two films and this is what made me believe that Ritchie's films are moving backwards - and for a director that's unforgivable.

197,marimba-easmon,Very Enjoyable,10,14 September 2008,"First of all, I'd just like to say that I'm sick and tired of people slating Guy Ritchie and incessantly questioning his credibility as a director of so-called 'Mockney' gangster flicks. Why do critics constantly scrutinize his back-ground,when film directing has nothing to do with one's personal experience of the subject matter? It's about a director's ability to connect with the audience through a visual medium, which Guy Ritchie does in spades. It's almost like people are saying that for Ritchie to convincingly direct a film about Cockney gangsters, he would have to had lived next door to the Krays twins. Give me a break! Did anyone question Ang Lee's ability to direct Brokeback Mountain or Sense and Sensibility? No! If the anti-Ritchie brigade had their way, they'd have insisted that Ang Lee, who is from Taiwan, would have had to live with gay cowboys on an American ranch before he was capable of directing his Oscar winning epic. Personally, I think that British critics are too harsh on their own films and directors. At a time when so few Brit flicks make it into the mainstream, we should applaud Guy for championing well-produced, visually stunning films. More power to him, I say!",RocknRolla

The Rocknrolla due to his almost non-existent screen time should have a bigger importance in the conclusion of things but that just didn't happen. Is it a come back for guy Richie?

And what happened to Thandie Newton? And why was Mark String's character bothering to meet Kenny's stepson at the end? And who murders a bouncer with a pencil in front of a hundred witnesses and it's never mentioned again? And what was the point of the 'Tank' character? Just Awful!",RocknRolla

""RocknRolla"" is the film. It is very funny and all round entertaining. You won't see a better ensemble piece this year. Absolute brilliance.Now what you should know about me is that I am a big Gerard Butler Fan so you may think there is some bias in my review of this film because of him. He was absolutely fantastic and of course, gorgeous as ever as ""One Two"", working brilliantly as 1 third of the Wild Bunch, with Handsome Bob and Mumbles.But for me, the performance and scene stealer was Toby Kebbell as Johnny Quid - he was absolutely brilliant, witty and had some great lines and how he brought the character to life was nothing short of perfection . We will be hearing more of him, on the strength of his performance here and I expect he'll be in line for some awards in the near future for this role. All praise to Guy Ritchie for writing superb characters and a great script. I would certainly recommend this film to anyone and it boasts an excellent soundtrack.

Its all about the rock n rolla attitude, which is a thing I think people don't get. I think people walked in to this movie: either unfamiliar with ""Snatch"" and the masterpiece that it was, or expecting a violent action crime film with no substance or meaningful dialogue (sort of like what Jason Statham is doing these days, shame). This movie embodies an attitude that some people of this day and age are unfamiliar with: the Rock N Roll attitude. what is a rock n rolla? well you'll just have to see to find out. all i can tell you is that he gets what he wants, and he doesn't give a f*ck what you think about it. this movie is all about the attitude, the music, substance, and a little action and crime in movies never hurt anyone. and Karma and revenge are two things that never disappoint, either. if you are a fan of ""Snatch"" or ""Lock, stock"" see this movie.

Everything, from the stellar ensemble cast to the pacing and character development was pitch perfect. Everyone I spoke with after the screening agreed, it was the most FUN we've had with a film in ages. We laughed out loud, we cringed, we clapped and cheered. It's everything you could want for entertainment.The character development and flow were spot on, it gave enough to understand perspectives and motivations without slowing the story down one bit. And there are some real 'characters' in this film - delightfully quirky, oh so colorful and just the right bit of humanity to make it all come alive.There are some fantastic scenes and sequences in this film that people will be talking about for years to come. The acting was top notch, the writing excellent, great story with perfect direction and editing. This film leaves you with a sense of fun that stays with you long after you've left the theater.If you prefer films of immense depth, with long drawn out shots of meaningful glances full of unexpressed emotions, and character development that explores the minutiae of the human psyche, then you're in luck - Oscar drama season is upon us and you have a plethora of boring and dull films to choose from. As for me, I don't care much for films that make me want to hurl myself off the top of the parking garage, life's too important to be so serious all the time. I'd rather be a RocknRolla.",RocknRolla

Rocknrolla is a film that doesn't keep you guessing, in fact, it makes you think about having spent your entrance fee on another film.

It was clever, witty, funny. The only thing that was a little screwy was the plot, but other than that I thought the dialogue acting more than made up for the structure of the movie.Gerard Butler played a real ""good guy criminal"", thandie newton was very sensual w/o being a tramp, Tom Wilkinson made a perfect haughty, loudmouthed mob boss and Toby Kebbel made one hell of a rock and rolla...giving the movie a very distinct taste.Now a lot of American WT morons out there with short attention spans probably got bored with ""all the talking"". It was necessary to build out the characters and if you paid attention it was pretty damn witty and entertaining.So many of you permanent adolescent idiots out there aren't entertained unless you see tons of unnecessary explosions and some dumb whor- shaking her fake breasts on the film.Good flick!

This film is literally hard to watch and is so chock-full of obvious and clanging clichés that you would laugh if you didn't feel like crying. The main character (once you work out that he is the main character) murders someone with a pencil for Christ's sake! For no other reason than 'he's a total bad-ass'. What's the point, I ask you?

There is no movie I have ever seen that has so many characters that are as fun to watch as in Snatch. I was looking forward to RocknRolla. So sad. Yikes! I barely liked any character. The action and dialog seem geared more to audience members of the half-wit gang-impersonator ilk that are rampant in today's global culture. Just kind of stupid glorification of violence and macho-posturing. I don't know how Guy descended into this kind of low cinema. I like his previous crime movies because they are thoughtful, novel, intelligent, and had colorful characters played by good actors who ate their roles up in style. And ultimately, even if some were truly bad guys, they played them with such panache you relished their performance(ex. Brick Top). With this movie it was almost the opposite: I found myself disliking almost everyone in it. Most everyone was bland and the ones that stood out were not the ones I would want to stand out and watch(the punk rocker kid, barf.)

That was a little difficult to get over but I managed to get over this tiny hurdle and really got in to the movie from then on. The movie looks arty-farty in a shaky/zoom-in camera type of way from the very beginning with great opening credits, purposeful opening title music, slick direction, good acting and quite a tight story in a Brit flick type of way that has a painting at the heart of the story, but you never see what is on the canvas (this is similar to pulp fiction with the bag). Finally a couple of Russians are thrown in for good measure just to shake things up and you have a winner in my opinion. Out of all the characters in the film Johnny Quid steals the show being the central character in a junkie type of way. All other cast members give a good performances with some good comic moments.

The movie is missing (and you may disagree with me about this) a plot, a lead, a villain, action and comedy.

Jeremy Piven and Ludicrous cameo as members of this intertwined story as Gerald Butler heads a group of thieves called the Wildboys.

223,clarkeke,Don't hold your breath,6,4 September 2008,"It says something that most of the press coverage for Guy Ritchie's new film 'Rocknrolla' surrounds the fact that Madonna was late for the London premiere. While the name Madonna is somewhat synonymous with 'show stealer', some might argue that the vast coverage of this minor marital incident masks the fact that Ritchie's film doesn't merit any serious film chit chat.Don't listen to the cynics, 'Rocknrolla' is actually a decent comeback for Mr Madonna, who has been lingering in the limbo of film failure after no goers like 'Swept Away' and 'Revolver'. The film, set in London's seedy underworld, is strikingly similar to previous successes, 'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels' and 'Snatch', and features the same sort of thuggish geezer characters but this time with a homo-erotic subtext. While Ritchie's film masquerades as homophobic to the max, there are certain scenes, (the gangsters discover the Russian gangsters in full dominatrix get-up about to perform a certain act on one of their men), where one might not be too sure if the geezer gangsters want to pop a cap in the Russian's asses or strip down and join in.I think Ritchie was well aware that this film would make or finally break him, and to be honest I don't think it'll do either. He played it safe and did what he's good at, hence the copycat characters (the pool of what he's good at is not a deep one). The only new character is Thandie Newton's Stella, 'the accountant'. If the director intended her to be a strong female character he is worse than I ever imagined for all the slow motion shots of her legs, face and ass surely compromise and completely eradicate any idea of her as the brains behind the operation.In short, the soundtrack's great, the stylized cinematography is unoriginal but great, and while Ritchie's film has an overly complicated plot and pretty standard Ritchie characters, it is definitely not his third turkey in a row.

It goes round and round without going into details and the ending was nothing special, but hey that's my opinion. Go see it and judge for yourself. Anyway going from Revolver to this is a step backward, after such a packed story like Revolver that works on many levels to this running around city, some vague dialogs and lame jokes that i heard a million times is just not something i would expect from this director.

Some people say that this is ""okay"" because it is just Ritchie's style coming through in his films and liken my distaste for this to a distaste for one of Monet's paintings because it looks like the others. I beg to differ. Whereas having a style is an important aspect of any artist's career, it does not excuse an artist from having original thoughts. In my opinion, RocknRolla is a downright copy of his previous movie Snatch (and perhaps his others that I haven't seen).It takes place in the same area, the characters develop in the same way (they even look and talk in the same way), the plot is essentially the same (replacing underground boxing and a diamond for property management and English pounds), and the cinematography is (not surprisingly) the same.So if you like Guy Ritchie, then you'll like this movie since it's nothing new.

You first meet Lenny Cole(Tom Wilkinson) who is the leader of a mob firm that he likes to call the old school. Then there is the new school which is led by Uri Omovich(Karel Roden). These two big figures are sorting out a deal which will let Uri build an arena in the heart of London. You can see straight away that Lenny and Uri are big money makers but they don't really look like gangsters so you know they must have bigger men working for them. As one thing leads to another Uri lends Lenny a very valuable painting as a sign of his good will but this painting soon goes on to be stolen. This is where Archie comes into the film as Lenny's right hand man. He goes looking for the stolen painting and you know he won't let anything stand in his way. Then there is the the Wild Bunch who steal money from the Russian using inside information from his accountant, the lovely Stella. The wild bunch are more like criminals and you know they are all in it for the money. Stella is very cunning and she also wants her part of the money but she also looks to get a bit of One Two (Gerald Butler). You go on to find the painting has been stolen by Johnny Quid(Tony Kebbell) who is the son of Lenny and also a big rock star that is supposedly dead.The painting then gets moved around between Johnny, One Two and Archie as they all try to get there hands on it. This leads to the Russians attacking the wild bunch and almost killing them until Archie arrives just in time. Archie takes the wild bunch to Lenny who threatens to kill them all but Johnny reveals Lenny is the rat who put the wild bunch in jail a few years back so they go onto kill him and Johnny and Archie come together to run the mob which will happen in The Real Rock n Rolla which should be released in 2010.What I liked about the film was the Ritchie style that he has always had was still there and he used it perfectly. It wasn't heavy on guns and drugs there was more storyline with these things included. The wittiness and pace of the film always kept me entertained. The Usual voice-over to go with the film reminded me of Lock Stock and Snatch so it was good to see this because Revolver didn't seem like a Ritchie film at all. The twists through the film keep it entertaining and the end gives it even more good recognition because I think it was a really good dramatic ending and I know I wasn't expecting it. The way the door has been kept open for a second film was also very clever because there is still a lot of story to cover. Acting performances from Gerald Butler and Mark Strong were vital to the film because they kept the Ritchie gangster theme alive with there tough styles and fast paced actions.Ritchie is great because you can tell he is still doing want he wants and he won't let Hollywood draw him in. Questions were raised after Revolver but Ritchie has gone back to the drawing board and done what he does best. Ritchie is still an amazing genuine talent to film and with two sequels in mind for the film it shows that we still have more of the talent to see from Ritchie.",RocknRolla
227,steff_the_kyng,A little summary,10,19 March 2009,"This movie enters the world of scums of London...It's a Guy Ritchie signature movie...The movie is about a London mob boss named Lenny Cole who puts the bite on all real estate transactions.He knows anyone you need if you wan't to buy a house or to make a project....and for some big cash he helps a Russian developer named Uri Omovich.The action is complicated like it is in all Guy Ritchie movies.....While the Russian tries to pay Lenny ,the Wild Bunch , being tipped by Uri's accountant, manages to steal Uri's money.Meanwhile, a local drug-addled rocker, Johnny Quid, is reported drowned, and his connection to Cole is the key to unraveling the deceits and double crosses of life in the underworld. I think that this is a very good movie, it has them all:action,comedy,guns,indestructible russians ,mob bosses and RocknRolla....So listen to my advice and watch this movie",RocknRolla
228,abchernin,Excellent.,9,22 March 2009,"Best chase scene ever.Best sex scene ever.And probably the best Russian's depiction by an Englishman so far.That ought to say it. If that's not enough, let's just say you get the best of Ritchie here: masterfully composed frames, brilliantly (read: properly and not annoyingly) utilized flashback and slow motion techniques, atmosphere-enhancing colors selection (not the ""Lock, Stock.."" or ""Snatch"" -y single-tone approach, more of a ""Revolver""'s style), great soundtrack, and, of course, tons of wit.Fans of ""Lock, Stock..."" are likely enjoy it. Fans of ""Revolver"", too. Hell, even the fans of those cool BMW and Nike commercials are, in fact, probably the most. If you've ever seen a single scene made by Guy Ritchie and liked it, this movie is for you. Enjoy ;) P.S. About those first three lines: I meant it. ;)",RocknRolla
229,tsammons,one of the greatest movies ever,10,25 December 2009,"Can watch it 10 times and still see new things you missed, Just like snatch, Ritchie is a genius. Hoskins was Harold Shand, kingpin of London crime, corrupter of cops, councilors and lawyers. He was manoeuvring to bring in the American mafia on a big London property deal when someone started taking liberties on his manor, blowing up stuff and killing people. Fantastic acting, great plot great shooting, Excellent acting Butler is great as is Archie , and of course the cameo of russains being weird, I really like this movie and will be watching it over and over. I have recommended it to everybody I know and not had one complaint",RocknRolla
230,dgemeio,Jason Statham misses,10,17 May 2011,"The only thing missing in this movie is Jason Statham that didn't join his dear family... he was sold to the transporters...if you loved movies like ""lock stock and two smoking barrels"" or ""Snatch"" or ""Revolver""... this movie is perfect. The soundtrack is the best for the movie... the acting, the actors, there is no possible way that this movie could be better, it should have a 10 out of 10 rating no questions asked. OK that is all... why do I have to write 10 lines? Can it be a random case? OK...this is eleven. why the review isn't ready for submission yet?... Come on... I must write more? more?? MORE???? -.- thank you.",RocknRolla
231,mattwatts-36-930256,Absolute Masterpieces,10,23 April 2011,"To begin, Lock Stock and Two Smokin' Barrels, ...excellent. Snatch! Extremely!!!! entertaining, you like dawgs:) that's awesome. Rock N Rolla, the most entertaining movie I've ever seen, I swear like Doctor Who it will absolutely grows on you,& it is the best show yet! Guy Ritchie would you please make more of these fantastic programs you've got the power, and if you're short on talented actors, Ha ha I am willing to act in (won:) for 2 weeks free if you need (2 Weeks vacation required though, from my current job helping poor unfortunates), because of the USA S*hit*y progroamas and there's no excuse for that sh""i't!,this site wants me to write more lines for this review so eh! what is wrong with a good F-ing job dude?!. So to fill the gap, I'll tell you about the Pirates of the Caribbean ride in Disney land. It is awesome, do it at least once, except as I was 1.5 years old i nearly Sh@i*t my jumpers, my poor old dad as he is now, had to sit on me during the ride and tell me i couldn't swim to keep me from jumping from the boat. Oh yeah also like every 8 year old was thinking when Modonna was singing like a virgin, I totally thought she was talking' about Lions, Wait'a'go MTV and your fing videos, wow was I wrong! Good f-ching track though!",RocknRolla
232,toghrulabdullayev,Definitely top 10 ever,10,23 September 2014,"This movie has all what it takes to be a legend.I don't remember any character in this movie which doesn't make impression or which is not unique. Guy Ritchie has made his best with this movie.The awesomeness of this movie is not only it's character, but music too. I have almost all the music used in this movie in my daily play list and I'm astonished by the music choice.However, it would be not quite fair to say that the movie is 100% perfect. But it is very close. For example, the Russian billionaire actually doesn't look like a tough guy. He looks more like a regular worker rather than a boss with several billion dollars in his bank account. Another thing is the gay advocate who acts too dumb, which is not too realistic.At the end of the day, you can call this one of the best movies ever made, if you look carefully :)",RocknRolla
233,sumona-florence,"It's a great watch, definitely one to add to the experience.",10,14 October 2015,"I won't make much of a post about what happens in this film ( I don't like being the spoiler), however, it definitely is one you'd have to see to add to the 'watched list'. It's totally worth it, the story's somewhat all over the place but you can fill in the gaps no problem. Gerard Butler isn't the center of attention, neither is Mark Strong, there's a great balance between the story of each actor in the movie and hilarious scenes and great comebacks bit after bit. Johnny Quid's portrayal would have to be a favourite of mine.In short. The 7.1 doesn't do it justice. I'd rather watch this than Mad Max Fury Road. Tom Hardy was simply great, too.",RocknRolla
234,nassim-deco,A Masterpiece !!!!!,10,25 November 2013,"wow! This movie is Ritchie's MasterPiece. it's the incarnation of ""cool-awesome-amazing"". for me it combines everything i wish in one single movie: action comedy drama and coolness. ignore the negative reviews from some finical people that they have no idea what they are looking for in a movie....if you haven't seen it before what are you waiting for?. go for it . can't wait for the second movie .",RocknRolla
235,colinm74,If it Ain't Broke Don't Fix it,8,20 August 2013,"RocknRolla is a Guy Ritchie film through and through, if you've seen one of his others like Lock, Stock or Snatch you've pretty much seen them all. And yet that never stops them from being so thoroughly enjoyable. Witty dialog, fast action, incompetent gangsters, and interwoven story lines may be in all his films but there is a reason and that's because they're good things to have! So it does nothing new, RocknRolla is still one heck of a film. With violent humor and classic mix ups as the different levels of lowlifes clash over a stolen lucky painting (which just happens to be a gift from the controller of the newly arrived Russian mobsters). The acting is as always top notch with Butler giving a great performance along with the rest of the cast as they deliver the trademark witty banter against the grimy backdrop of the London underworld filmed brilliantly as always. Ritchie is definitely back to his old form with RocknRolla and if it's more of the same well that's a good thing in my opinion. As they say, if it ain't broke don't fix it.",RocknRolla
236,pia_sk,loved it!,9,22 December 2008,"Just saw the movie last night, and I was a little bit anxious and afraid to get my hopes up. But I wasn't disappointed in anyway. Guy Ritchie is back. This movie is Lock, Stock all grown up and the problems have equally grown.Some critics say that it's been seen before. Okay the genre isn't new, but Guy Ritchie knows how to write it and give it a new twist. There's more action, surprising twists and more laughs.By using a narrative character through out the movie, you get that extra insight into the characters and the storyline without adding extra tedious minutes to the movie.Loved it!",RocknRolla
237,freakinabsuit,"Fantastic film, such a great surprise!",10,6 September 2008,"There is a new gang of Russian mobsters in London planning to create a real estate goldmine lead by Uri(Karl Roden). But they need the help of Lenny(Wilkinson) to get permission so he lends him his ""lucky painting"" this in turn disappears bringing Stella the accountant(Newton) and the Wild Bunch(Elba,Butler,Hardy) into the Fray. Amongst all this Is Rockstar Johnny Quid and his Agents(Kebbell,Piven,Bridges). Get ready for another multi stranded cockney Ritchie film.First of all, so you know, I have been long anticipating this film (I mean who wouldn't just for the cast alone?) so didn't go in with low expectations, they were high and this film still managed to surpass them. Lets start with the aforementioned cast... they are all absolutely fantastic but they are aided by beautifully written characters. Gerard Butler(One Two) and Idris Elba(Mumbles) have more chemistry on screen than most Hollywood romcom leading couples. They snap and crack off each other like they've done it for years. In fact the entire ""Wild Bunch"" as they are known in the film provide some of its best moments, from a visceral heist scene with some unstoppable Russian heavies(which oozes style) to a hilarious running sub-plot about Bob's(Tom hardy) sexual orientation. Matt King also provides a great turn as the Wild Bunch's in house drug dealer Cookie, he also turns in one of the movies best scenes, an eerie narration on heroine addiction. Wilkinson is firing on all cylinders in a role that could have just been his Carmine Falcone with a cockney accent but manages to be much more as well as pretty scary. But it is Mark Strong who comes up trumps in this storyline, his portrayal of Archie the right hand man is probably the most rounded character in the film, full of humour and wit and with an undeniable likability he steals much of the scenes he appears in. And now on to Toby Kebbell as junkie Rockstar Johnny Quid, this is a role that if the academy were a little less narrow-minded they would consider supporting actor nod. He is scum, but his character is such that he is witty and somewhat of a poet/philosopher, fantastically written and Kebbell plays it brilliant. You are never sure what hes going to do next, I guarantee he will take you by surprise.And now onto the man of the moment, Ritchie. There was a lot of scepticism about this film considering how badly his past two films did critically and commercially. But what is clear from this is that instead of going the safe root and doing a film that will please all he has once again done his own thing the way he wanted to do it and the result is a fantastic piece of film-making.I really hope RocknRolla makes the money it deserves and gets a wider release in America, it is a film that needs to be seen. Its funny, clever, visually stunning and is a perfect example of a man doing things his own way and not succumbing to the pressures of the media. Well done Ritchie, well done cast, Im up for the Real RocknRolla and when you see it so will you!",RocknRolla
238,bluelight-54428,When Guy Ritchie was Guy Ritchie,8,10 November 2018,"Seeing this movie again today, reminded me of the times when Guy Ritchie was a top class director. Sadly, in the past few years he lost whatever magic he had, his movies have no more sparkle and no identity like Rockn Rolla, Revolver, Snatch and Lock Stock and two smoking barrels used to have. After seeing your boring movies The man from UNCLE and King Arthur, i won't be watching your movies no more anonymous Guy Ritchie.",RocknRolla
239,mapleann,"Fantastic, Worth Watching, Loved it!",10,7 September 2008,"Like I said, fantastic film, loved it, and it's very watchable. Lot of action, excellent acting and more importantly in these bleak days, a great laugh. Not a spoiler but the first 'heist' scene had me in tears.....and the second had me in hysterics! And there are to be further films...........Yeah! Always liked Mark Strong and Tom Wilkinson, and to see the hunky Gerry Butler alive at the end of a movie is a bonus.....and did I say he's a great actor, very versatile........and then there's Tom Hardy, very handsome indeed! I'm not going to list all the other wonderful actors that have come together to give us such a delight, go see it for yourself, and enjoy!",RocknRolla
240,harrytate-08783,A Great Cast Having Fun,10,26 January 2018,"I can't think of a better rock and roll sound track to this movie than what you get with RocknRolla. Besides the terrific music, there can't be a movie made anywhere in the world today with the cast of this one. So, besides a fun film with enough action for most people, the music and the performers in this thing is a treat.",RocknRolla
241,evanstanxstucky,NO STORY LINE ?????,4,5 October 2018,I just watched whole emptyness. Just loved the tom hardys character and this point for him.,RocknRolla
242,niller20,Guy Ritchie - doing what he does best,8,29 December 2008,"It's as simple as this - If you liked Lock Stock and Snatch, you'll like RockNrolla. The plots are similar, the characters are similar, and the whole feel surrounding the movie..... is similar.After watching ""Revolver"" and hearing how awful ""Swept away"" is supposed to be, I had a bad feeling that Guy Ritchie was finished. I loved Lock Stock and Snatch and was gravely disappointed by Revolver, so it was with a tiny amount of apprehension when I went to the Cinema on Christmas day to see RockNrolla. I wasn't expecting much, but was hoping for it all - and to a certain extent, my wish was granted.This movie is solid and entertains you from start to finish. The plot unravels slowly but surely in the usual Guy Ritchie sort of way, introducing us to all the criminal characters that we follow throughout the movie. Gerard Butler (the guy from 300) gives a good performance as OneTwo, Mark Strong does brilliantly as Lenny Cole's right hand man Archie, and Thandie Newton is as breathtakingly beautiful as ever! I have to say I was slightly disappointed with Tom Wilkinsons performance as Gangster Boss Lenny Cole, as he never came close the other savage gangster bosses from Ritchie's earlier movies (Hatchet Harry and Brick Top), but overall he delivered a standard performance which in the end made the movie work. The movie is very alive throughout, and with the constant return to Johnny Quid (Toby Kebell) and the ""Russians"" who keep popping up, the intensity maintains it's pace and makes you want to know what happens next.If I were to point out something negative about this movie it's got to be the fact that it does not have the same graphical affect as the others. There is hardly any violence (not that Im saying it's a must) but it does make this kind of movie stronger, and I kind of felt as I was heading home, that stronger scenes would have given it that extra something.The end of the movie does reveal that there is going to be a sequel named ""The real RockNrolla"" which I will definitely be going to see. RockNrolla is decent entertainment in the old Guy Ritchie way - funny, fast and dirty. If you're looking for a good action movie with all sorts of criminals, you'll love RockNrolla!!!",RocknRolla
