0,SnoopyStyle,natural,7,23 September 2018,"Brady Blackburn lives with his father Wayne and his younger autistic sister Lilly. He's a rodeo cowboy who suffered a bad head injury after getting thrown. The injury has long lasting effects and he's ordered not to ride anymore. His drunken father gambles away any money and sells Brady's horse to keep the trailer.This is a slice of life movie. It's low on melodrama and high on character study. Being such an important part of the film, I'd prefer a more established actor in the lead. The lead is very natural as a quiet stoic cowboy. He needs to project his inner turmoil but the amateur is not a real actor. It's almost a cinematic look inside a real family. In that way, there is a great realism in this world but the acting intensity is much lower.",The Rider
1,Hitchcoc,A Film of Serious Authenticity,10,1 March 2019,"""The Rider"" takes us on a young man's journey--and I mean a young man. A serious contender on the rodeo circuit, this boy has a bad fall and suffers brain damage. This damage is never discounted. He does what he can to maintain the macho bit, but he knows that his future is going to be away from horses. He lives with his father and sister. They are in relative poverty and their prospects are not good. Someone said, in another review, that this is a lot like a documentary, in that there are few spectacular moments Brady has no outlet for his wishes, even though he tries. I appreciated that the film did not try to insult our intelligence by making it a kind of Rocky movie. Beautifully crafted in the flat Dakota grasslands, it works on nearly every level.",The Rider
2,Horst_In_Translation,"Too much of a sob story at times, but as a whole a pretty good character study",6,25 June 2018,"""The Rider"" is a new American full feature film that premiered back in 2017 and it is the second theatrical release (after a handful of short movies) for writer and director Chloé Zhao and for that, these almost 105 minutes are a pretty respectable achievement. It is also much more known than her first already. Which may not necessarily have to do with the cast as pretty much everybody in here is even more of a rookie than Zhao. If you look at their bodies of work and also at their first names, you could almost say that this is a documentary movie. Brady Jandreau's own background emphasizes this even more. So good acting all along I would say. Speaking about the documentary element here, I am not sure how much of what we see in here really did happen as it gets a bit too melodramatic sometimes. The disabled fella, the severe injuries to the protagonist, the disabled sister, the near-death experience at the end, the horse shooting part and so on. It is a bit much probably, even if most of it is executed with precision. I thought the disabled sister was really good too, so good that I was genuinely worried something horrible could happen to her in the end that eventually causes the main character to lose his sanity the way he was close to in this wrestling moment already when we find out a great deal about the aggression he carries under his surface.More words on the dad who may have been my favorite character: He was written so well, and he performed so convincingly too. He did care a lot for his son, but struggled with showing him, not just because of his gambling problems, but because of his character that just won't allow many emotions to the surface and prefers to work it cool instead. But the final scene in which he brings his daughter to the show at the end is maybe the most subtly touching father-son moment of the entire film and how he shows his son how much he wants him to live and what he is about to lose. And let's not forget about all the struggles his dad has been facing when it comes to his wife and his three children (that we know of). So yes this is a somewhat different western we have here, don't expect a great deal of Brokeback Mountain this time, in terms of style and tone it felt a lot more resembling ""The Wrestler"" in my opinion. So the title fits too. And the film does not lose itself in romance plots as there is so much other stuff going on in Brady's life. The one question that will be with you throughout the film from start to finish for over 1.5 hours is if he will live or die at the very end. Go and watch for yourself. Maybe you will be intrigued, maybe not by this slightly underseen film. But most likely you will not be disappointed. I give it a thumbs-up. Good cinematography too that many other westerns these days can learn something from for sure.",The Rider
3,searchanddestroy-1,The lusty men,10,29 March 2018,"Of course, everyone of you has recognized in the introduction word of my comment the link I have made between this authentic masterpiece and the Nick Ray's movie sfrom 1952 starring Bob Mitchum and Susan Hayward. That's not just another movie about rodeos, such as LUSTY MEN, JUNIOR BONNER or JW COOP, with Cliff Robertson, it's also a very sensitive movie showing poignant characters. It's a movie about the true valor of America, its origin, its genesis far from racism, junk food or firearms madness matters. It helps to forget where America drives at since one year now, maybe to the doom pit...It shows genuine Americans. That's my analysis.",The Rider
4,evanston_dad,Quietly Astonishing,10,16 November 2018,"""The Rider"" stars a bunch of non-actors playing characters based on themselves and recreating their own stories on screen. The result is authentic and astonishing in a quiet way. The acting is one of this film's biggest assets, and how Chloe Zhao managed to get the performances she did from a group of non-professionals is a minor miracle of directing.I shouldn't have had much sympathy for the characters in ""The Rider."" They embody much of what I think is wrong with our country right now, in which a dysfunctional atmosphere is being created by a bunch of rural macho posturing. The protagonist is a young man who's been badly injured in a rodeo and faces giving up the only thing that gives his life meaning or purpose. Yes, that thing isn't especially good for him or the animals subjected to it, so ""tough cookies"" one might be inclined to say. But the film is so sensitive, and the performances so authentic, that my heart went out to this man. We all make our way through this world in the best way we know how, and each of us has our own definition of what makes life worth living. Only the most callous among us could see another person lose that and not feel empathy.A beautiful, beautiful film, and easily one of the top two (the other being ""First Reformed"") I've seen this year.Grade: A+",The Rider
5,ferguson-6,Cowboy up,8,27 April 2018,"Greetings again from the darkness. Sometimes the universe creates its own balance. Watching this little independent gem the day before watching the new Avengers movie reinforces what a diverse art form the cinema provides. Writer/director Chloe Zhao continues to make her presence felt as a filmmaker, and movie lovers are the beneficiaries. While filming her feature film debut SONGS MY BROTHER TAUGHT ME on the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota in 2015, Ms. Zhao met Brady Jandreau, a rising young star on the rodeo circuit. She knew a movie was in their future, but it wasn't until the following year when the story wrote itself. Brady suffered a severe head injury after being bucked by a bronco. He was in a coma for 3 days, and a metal plate was screwed into his skull. Doctors warned Brady that riding a horse again could kill him.This is not a documentary, but it's pretty darn close. Brady Jandreau plays Brady Blackburn, a rodeo bronco rider and horse trainer who is recovering from a severe head injury. Mr. Landreau's real father Tim and sister Lilly also appear as themselves. In fact, most of the characters are locals rather than actors, and many (including the Jandreaus) are part of the Oglala Lakota Sioux tribe on the reservation. Also playing himself is Lane Scott, Brady's best friend who is now paralyzed and unable to speak - the tragic result of another rodeo ride gone wrong. These two are like brothers, and their interactions provide some of the most emotional moments in the movie.The film is more cycle of life, than circle of life. It's about having a lifelong dream snatched from your clutches. We follow Brady as he searches for his new place in life. Campfire confessions with his rodeo buddies portray the bond created by risking life and limb. His mother is dead, and Brady's dad has spent a lifetime telling him to ""cowboy up"" - meaning, be a man and fight through every situation. Now dad is telling him to ""let it go"" and ""move on"". This contradicts his friends who encourage him to not give up on his dream. Brady's moments with his sister Lilly are some of the sweetest and most poignant. Despite her autism, Lilly is precious as she sings songs and offers clear insight to her brother. This is less about acting and more about being. Guns, horses, and pot play significant roles throughout, as does the stunning South Dakota landscape as photographed by cinematographer Joshua James Richards. The intimacy of Brady's internal struggle somehow dwarfs the breathtaking sunsets. His quietly simmering intensity is masked by a stone face that only seems to brighten when around friend Lane, sister Lilly, or training yet another ""unbreakable"" horse.Rather than traditional story arc, this is simply a compelling way of life for people who put up no false fronts. Brady is trying to figure out how to be a man after life has stolen his dream. One's purpose is essential to one's being, and thanks to filmmaker Zhao we witness how one tough cowboy fights through.",The Rider
6,deloudelouvain,Rodeo is just animal abuse.,6,20 January 2019,"Maybe I scored it too low as the movie is well made, with good cinematography, and with a cast that acts very simply but also touching. It all looks very natural and that's a good thing. To me it's just the theme that didn't do it for me, as I don't see the point of rodeo riding besides being it unnecessary animal abuse. So the sad parts in this movie were not the family pain and distress but the animal torture instead. That's my point of view and I don't care what a redneck Bronco Billy thinks about it. But for the rest it's a touching story, well acted, and I can see why alot of cowboys would like this movie.",The Rider
7,Hellmant,"I have an extreme problem with animal cruelty, so I didn't really like most of what the movie's 'hero' stands for.",6,13 July 2018,"'THE RIDER': Three Stars (Out of Five)A western-drama about a former rodeo star who now suffers brain damage due to a bullriding accident. The film was shot all in the badlands of South Dakota, and it was written, produced and directed by Chloé Zhao. The movie stars newcomer Brady Jandreau, Lilly Jandreau, Tim Jandreau, Lane Scott, and Cat Clifford. It has received nearly unanimous positive reviews from critics, but I only found it to be mildly amusing (at best). Brady Blackburn (Brady Jandreau) was a rising rodeo star, who got into a serious bullriding accident. Now he suffers from brain damage due to it, and constant seizures. Brady lives in extreme poverty with his father (Tim Jandreau) and his sister (Lilly Jandreau), and he also spends a lot of time with his friend Lane (Lane Scott). The doctors tell Brady he can never ride again, but he just can't give up the dream that easily.The film is beautifully shot, in a stunning way even. The performances are pretty good as well, especially coming from such inexperienced rookie actors. Being a vegan though, I have an extreme problem with animal cruelty, so I didn't really like most of what the movie's 'hero' stands for. I'll admit it's a well made film to an extent though, but it's also extremely boring.",The Rider
8,MOscarbradley,One of the best films I've seen this year,9,24 December 2018,"""The Rider"" of the title is Brady Blackburn and he's played by Brady Jandreau, a non-professional who is basically 'playing' himself as indeed are everyone else in the cast. Chloe Zhao's film isn't a documentary but it may as well be since everything that happens is basically 'real', even if it is scripted, (by the director herself). Zhao has fashioned a scenario that in the hands of a more seasoned director would have smacked of Hollywood but this indie is totally unadorned and yet is ravishingly beautiful in a Malick kind of way, (it was actually filmed in the Badlands of Dakota). It could have been made in the seventies but then it would have had a professional cast and would have been the product of an established studio.Nothing happens. When the film opens Brady has suffered a serious head injury after being thrown at a rodeo and for the next two hours the film simply observes him adjust to a more sedentary kind of life but one that also includes a new-found relationship with a new horse. It's utterly unromantic and while clearly aimed at the festival circuit it's a film that deserves to find an audience and a life of its own long after the festivals finish. It's also one of the best films I've seen this year.",The Rider
9,ThomasDrufke,One Last Ride,6,8 December 2018,"Based on the true life story of Brady Blackburn (and acted entirely or almost entirely) by non-actors and the real-life people involved with Brady, The Rider is a gritty/realistic take on someone forced to give up on his dreams because a traumatic & life threatening accident. There is a great amount of added impact because it's the real people just re-enacting what has happened in their lives, but that also limits what the movie can present the audience beyond what could be seen in a documentary. At times it's impressively power, even in the most subtle ways, but I did feel like it was a little slow and never made a huge resonance on me as a viewer.6.5.10",The Rider
10,851222,"Slow, but good and very real",8,4 May 2019,"Greetings from Lithuania.""The Rider"" (2017) is slow burning character study drama set in present day west. Movie felt to me very real because characters weren't just a fiction - they were either real people either based on real people and their lives. I thought that acting was very solid by everyone and directing as well as script were very good as well. ""The Rider"" is a very slow burning drama without any action, but its a good one.",The Rider
11,westsideschl,Details,8,23 August 2018,"A docudrama which this case means it's around 60% factual and 40% dramatic license by the writer/director which is OK as long as that is presented to the viewers at some point which it was so kudos for that. Maybe that's why their last names were changed. Most characters play themselves and I commend the writer/director and those role players for a job well done in that respect. Also, for relaying a part of their lives (although perhaps money wasn't a hindrance). Lane's partial paralysis, motor skill & speech difficulties come from a vehicle accident, and he deserves much credit for both his strength as a person and his acting. It's good to see several recent movies showing the beauty of Eastern Montana & the Dakotas. One thing the film missed was being in a thunderstorm which were often seen in the distance (very frequent, & would have been dramatic). Another scene, and more important, was the killing of he horse w/a barbed wire cut to the knee/hock which unless completely cutting a tendon should have been seen by a vet. Horses don't need to be free range to be ""happy"" (a human anthropomorphism) they can live just as ""happily"" in a pasture as is the case w/many rescued horses. Probably not as money producing popular, but to me just a straight forward doc intersecting the individuals; the Lakota;, rodeo lives, animals & injuries; the plains, would have been more interesting.",The Rider
12,Dr_Coulardeau,Rebirth for an American Indian may be difficult,10,3 July 2018,"This is a film about Oglala Sioux in the Dakotas today one century or so after the end of the genocide and hardly fifty years after the end of total segregation and ten years or so after the final lawsuit giving all Indian reservations the compensations and « reparations » they were entitled to get after all the treacherous exploitation they have been the victims of. If there is any improvement since Wounded Knee, it is because American Indians have taken their own lives and their own future in their own hands and have decided to claim their heritage and a fair position in society as well as a fair and just independence and freedom on their reservations that are theirs and no one else's. Yet nothing is simple since Trump has managed to authorize the crossing of Indian land in Montana and the Dakotas for a pipeline that has no guarantee not to be a polluting hazard. The film is beautiful and at the same time very sad. Beautiful because of the human feelings these men feel and express for each other and one another. Beautiful because these young men want to stand tall, speak out and be what they dream to be and become. But beautiful too because on this rough road there are accidents and one has to accept one's lot and one's neighbor's lot because that neighbor is a brother of sorts, a brother in humanity and in ambition or dream. When a horse is wounded in a way or another he has to be shot out of misery. But human beings are supposed to cling to life and everyone is supposed to help the wounded man to survive and even live with his dream, even if this dream is now frustrated.This humanity is rare among human beings but it seems to be a rule among these Indians. And the sister and daughter, who is slightly handicapped is made as comfortable as possible and is protected against accidents that could happen in this life, accidents that could come along with harassment or even worse.It is true it is a world of men, and women are not very present in this environment. That's probably the shortcoming of the film because Indian women are essential in this renascence, this rebirth of a nation beyond its annihilation, because they can bring the traditions back, the theater, the dancing, and the music and then women and men are equal and have original contributions that are absolutely complementary. But since the film is centered on rodeo and horse training, it seems obvious women are not very present in this activity. Cowboys are boys and cowgirls have not been born yet. Next generation might change this.This film is a dramatized real story in which the main actors more or less live their own real lives as if they were true fiction, true to life and yet fictional by the dream invested in this true life.Dr. Jacques COULARDEAU",The Rider
13,eddie_baggins,One of 2018's most powerful drama's,9,24 September 2018,"To understand and truly appreciate the quiet and understated, yet graceful power and poignancy of The Rider, one must first understand the background to up and coming Chinese born director Chloe Zhao's independent offering.Telling the tale of injured American rodeo rider and genuine American cowboy Brady Blackburn, The Rider is an incredible feet of filmmaking nuance and care, due to the fact everyone we see and hear from in Zhao's tale plays a version of their real life selves.Lead impressively by Brady Jandreau as Brady, who indeed suffered a life threatening injury whilst participating in his beloved rodeo career, The Rider features non-actors playing impressively across a realistic and character driven narrative that encapsulates the modern day American west and the bravado that comes from it, as well as capturing beautifully the landscape that these wind swept plains entail.It's a filmmaking miracle achieved by Zhao, with so many film's that have tried to do similar things with non-actors failing to meet the mark (recent failure 15:17 to Paris a prime example) but Zhao's collection of non-actors (that includes Brady's Asperger's suffering sister Lilly and real life wheel-chair bound friend Lane Scott) all acquit themselves brilliantly to Brady's journey from potential rodeo star to struggling everyman, whose love for horses and skill in this field is a sight to behold.The Rider feels so close to being a documentary but also so carefully considered as a cinematic offering, that it acts as the perfect blend of realism and movie making magic as Zhao captures some breathtaking scenery and spectacle as well as some carefully observed human moments that will bring a tear to even the most hardened of hearts.It's the type of humanly resonate study that will reverberate through viewers of all shapes and sizes from the world over and there's little point in trying to argue that Zhao's film is underserving of its highly praised critical and audience run.Final Say - Easily one of the year's most impressive independent offerings, that features a collection of some of the most naturalistic non-actor performances seen in years, The Rider is a small film with a big heart, that also acts as a stunning and moving examination of the modern day American west.4 1/2 head-staples out of 5",The Rider
14,paul-allaer,"Best movie of the year so far, period",9,2 June 2018,"""The Rider"" (2017 release; 104 min.) brings the story of Brady, a rodeo cowboy somewhere in South Dakota's Badlands. As the movie opens, Brady is popping pills as he is recovering from a serious rodeo accident that led to a broken skulls (now reinforced with a metal plate and staples). We also get to know his family, as he lives with his dad and his sister 15 yr. old sister Lilly who has Asperger's syndrome. His mom passed away a few years back (we don't know from what). Hanging out with his friends, they wonder when he'll return to the rodeo competition. Then one day Brady's fingers claw up, and something seems very wrong. At this point we're less than 15 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the second movie from writer-producer-director Chloe Zhao, who previously gave us the excellent ""Songs My Brothers Told Me"". Here the Chinese film maker (who has lived in the US the past 2 decades) tackles a very American topic: the Big Sky cowboy mentality, with its horses, rodeo, macho and of course gun culture. Brady Jandreau, the real life bronco rider who almost died in real life, plays a thinly veiled version of himself as Brady Blackburn, who in the movie is trying to find a way in life after suffering the almost fatal accident. When Brady is hanging out with his buds, one of them comments ""I've had at least 10 concussions,; by NFL standards I should be dead by now"", and the group chuckles. Remarkably, Brady's family are also portrayed by his real life dad and sister, and in fact there isn't a single professional performer in the movie. Which makes Brady Jandreau's performance in the lead role all the more remarkable. He is in virtually every frame of the movie, and truly carries the movie on his shoulders. The movie's photography is pure eye-candy from start to finish. With this film, Zhao confirms, and then some, what an enormous talent that she is, and I can't wait to see what she will bring next.""The Rider"" premiered at last year's Cannes Film Festival, and received a US theatrical only last month (I have no idea why it has taken so long, but better late than never). The movie finally opened at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati this weekend, and i couldn't wait to see it. The Friday early evening screening where I saw this at was PACKED, much to my surprised. Who knew there was a pent-up demand for this movie? In the age of never-ending Avengers, Deadpool and Solo/Star Wars installations and rehashes, ""The Rider"" feels like a breath of fresh air. I see a lot of movies, and this one for me is the best film of the year so far, period. I'd readily encourage you to check it out in the theater (if you still can), on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion. For me, ""The Rider"" is a WINNER all the way.",The Rider
15,Turfseer,Talented director's heartfelt tale of injured rodeo star still needs more twists and turns at the hands of an experienced screenwriter,6,22 November 2018,"You might remember director Chloe Zhao who utilized Native American non-professional actors in her first feature, ""Songs my brother taught me."" She's back once again using non-professional actors in her story-this time about a rodeo rider who must cope with the end of his career after experiencing a traumatic brain injury (the film is set in a location near where Zhao's first effort was filmed-the badlands of South Dakota).
Zhao met the star of the film Brady Jandreau, the injured rodeo rider, prior to his real-life accident. Here he's called Brady Blackburn along with his father Tim and learning-disabled sister Lilly. Brady is particularly good for someone with no acting experience.
There's little of a concrete antagonist here but rather Zhao focuses on Brady's internal conflict: that he can't accept that he can no longer ride in the rodeo (or even train horses) but tries ""to get back in the game,"" despite all of his disabilities (he's subject to seizures and experiences paralysis in one of his hands as well).
The most compelling scenes involve Brady who takes up training horses after realizing that riding in the rodeo is no longer a possibility. Brady has a remarkable ability to communicate with horses and his talents in taming some very volatile equines, is quite apparent on screen.
There is a shattering scene where Brady comes to the realization that an injured horse he's been training (and bonding with) must be put down after sustaining a leg injury (Brady's dad puts down the horse with one clean pistol shot and orders his son away from the scene so he doesn't actually witness the sad and traumatic event).
The parts of Zhao's screenplay that deals with the human element unfortunately are not as good. Some of Brady's ""macho"" former rodeo buddies regard it as a weakness not returning to the profession and simply don't understand that Brady's brain injury prevents him from doing so. Nonetheless these characters are only seen briefly and provide just a small bit of conflict to move the story forward.
Zhao sets up a conflict between Brady and his dad, whom she depicts as a bit of a hard head with a gambling past. There's nothing distinctive about the father and he's very much a generic character, indicative of Zhao's inability to come up with something original.
Zhao is more successful with two peripheral characters who add to the overall atmosphere of the film. Those are Brady's sister Lilly, who despite the learning disability and occasional ""acting out"" behavior, appears wiser than her years. Then there's Brady's friend Lane, a former rodeo star, now a paraplegic, institutionalized with a severe brain injury (much worse than Brady's). He's there to highlight the compassion of Brady, who is always visiting his fallen friend, to cheer him up.
Ultimately Zhao's slow-moving narrative doesn't have enough twists and turns it to deserve all the accolades already heaped upon it. What it all comes down to is Brady coming to terms with a new reality-his ability in the end to say goodbye to his former career and now accept a new way of life. Indeed in the end he no longer deludes himself and it's a heartfelt scene where his dad and sister show up at the rodeo hoping that he doesn't go through with his threat to get back up on a horse.
Films reliant chiefly on internal arcs usually are less successful than those that feature a concrete human antagonist. Zhao next time should stick to directing (which she does so well) and conscript a more talented screenwriter to flesh out her true-life characters.",The Rider
16,iquine,Must See for Horse Lovers,9,12 February 2019,"(Flash Review)A rodeo rider has a nasty fall and ends up needing a steel plate placed in his skull. Riding and horses are his life. How will he cope without being able to compete anymore? Riding runs deep in his family's life and his culture to the point of obsession but it takes its toll due to the risks. The film takes a poetic approach to its storytelling; arguably a character study of this young man and nothing is spoon feed. Full or rich emotions, character depth and an excellent music score. Post the rodeo accident, there are many scenes with the rider as he tries to break in horses as something he can do with horses without riding. The rider is a great actor...pure cowboy traits. Looks like he was literally pulled off a ranch. After watching the DVD special features, this is almost a complete true story so yes in fact the actor WAS pulled off the ranch!! The father and sister are actually his really family too. This is a great and smart alternative to a super hero film. (nothing wrong with those by the way)",The Rider
17,juneebuggy,"Powerful, beautiful and intimate",9,3 September 2020,"This was fantastic, a very powerful & intimate movie, beautiful cinematography and kinda heartbreaking. Follows Brady Blackburn, a young cowboy facing an identity crisis after suffering a near fatal head injury on the rodeo circuit and being told that he can never ride again.For the most part this is a character study as Brady struggles to find himself; trying jobs outside of the circuit for the first time in his life, hanging with his friends, spending time with his autistic sister and his buddy in the rehab center, his father sells his horse, its a struggle.There are moments during this movie when you think wow these unknowns are acting there ass's off. Is that girl really mentally challenged, is the guy in the rehab really brain damaged, am I seeing a man break a horse in real time? Yes they are acting, but most of the characters here are playing versions of themselves that's why its so real, very clever. The director does a fantastic job of pulling emotions and scenes out of non professionals.The characters are also multifaceted, you start out thinking the dad is going to be the antagonist, the mean guy, or the drunk guy, well he is both of these things but he's also supportive and worries terribly about his son. None of the characters in this are Hollywood's version of or following a cookie cutter character formula, very refreshing.In the beginning we get a close up of a horses eye, late in the film there is a closeup of Brady's eye, they are the same, they feel the same, just a beautiful film.",The Rider
18,masonfisk,ONE FOR THE AGES...!,10,2 December 2018,"An inspired tale of a broken down rodeo rider recovering from a brutal fall trying to get back into the game when all physical signs tell him it's over. It could play as a double bill to The Wrestler in which Mickey Rourke's character's time has come but his instincts & stubbornness tell him otherwise. Using real people to portray themselves (the lead, his sister & father are related in real life) lends a beautiful air of documentary to the events depicted on the film that doesn't glamorize the sport (much like a bigger budgeted Hollywood film would give us) & entwines us in the brutal poetry that comes about when one's chosen dream fizzles away slowly before one's eyes.

19,aidanratesmovies,The Rider,7,17 May 2020,"Well acted and well shot, but ultimately lacking in something more, The Rider has its moments of brilliance, but is ultimately impacted by the artificial nature that it is held captive to. The film is filled with some surprisingly touching performances. The cast is largely full of performances by those whom the main character and main subject of interest the film is based upon, was involved with and knowing that fact, I expected to feel a bit more while watching throughout. The film is very slow at times, and becomes slower as it goes on. The film does a good job of letting you care for the main character, but in all, it is hard to care enough to put your attention and focus on the mundane things occurring throughout the film. It can be tropey at times too, with many similar works and plot devices used throughout it as emotional support. It is full of some quite beautiful shots, and Brady Jandreau truly provides an emotional core with his performance in the film. In the end, I left The Rider feeling more bored than satisfied, but for those willing to keep up with the dead-crawl pacing, The Rider is a sublime and well acted piece of rural america, and is certainly unique in that aspect, despite following some key modern tropes.

21,Movie-ManDan,A Truly Beautiful Picture.,10,24 December 2018,"Sometimes the best movies to see have very little special effects. Sometimes the best movies are very similar to one's own life. That is very much true with Chloé Zhao's contemporary heartland western. The characters play iterations of themselves in the badlands of South Dakota. Names and events have been slightly changed for dramatic purposes.The film centres on Brady Blackburn (whose real last name is Jandreau) who lives in a modular home with his imperfect father and mentally challenged sister (and are his real life family members) who has always dreamed about making it big in the rodeo circuit. But he suffered a near death accident with his skull. He now has a massive scar at the side of his head and his right hand sometimes gets seizures. He gets a job at a supermarket and does does not give up on hope. He even visits his best friend, Lane Scott in the hospital. Lane was a circuit guy like Brady, but suffered an accident similar to Brady's but has been left in much worse condition. It is truly heartbreaking to see Lane. We see Brady, but Lane is so much worse. Despite knowing that he could end up like Lane or even have THE worst fate happen, Brady cannot imagine himself doing anything else. It truly hurts that he can one a rodeo cowboy.Taking place is America's heartland, Zhao is able to photograph beautiful images of mountains, clouds, and desert areas. Much of this movie is filmed with handheld cameras, but we are still able to see exquisite landscapes and beautiful animals. The general look of this film is a great reason to see this. Yeah it's no 'Dr. Zhivago' or 'Gandhi' but this arthouse picture comes as close to those images as possible.'The Rider' has a very unoriginal story: a dreamer is told not to pursue his goals, but he cannot imagine doing anything else so he rebels. The difference between this and others is it's authenticity. Everyone here are friends and family of an untrained actor who the movie hinges on. Brady gives one of the year's very best performances. Any less from Brady and this movie could have been a bust. We gradually become invested and immersed inside Brady himself. At the beginning he watches his accident on his phone. I, at least, felt nothing. The phone took up too little space on the screen, plus we don't know this guy. By the end, every move Brady makes we feel hugely. And it does not take long before we get inside Brady and feel everything he does to a great degree.I loved this more the second time watching it. As time grows on, I might love it even more.3.5/4",The Rider
22,pc95,"Simple, Well-Shot but Unaffecting",6,9 September 2018,"Sometimes movies are overrated, and I think this is the case for director Chloe Zhao's ""The Rider"" whose movie is sort of a docudrama that doesn't hit strong notes. Perhaps its the subject-matter. She tries mightily with a poignant back-score to many of her visuals to evoke and stir but rodeo doesn't fly. Its not all about rodeo, but there's not much relatable to rodeos - and certainly motivations related to it. While the horses and many of scenes are beautiful to behold, the story is not. Director Zhao has recruited non-actors in attempt to freshen the screen, but there's an aimlessness at hand that's not very endearing despite her efforts. There's nothing wrong with working at a grocery store. I came in knowing zip about the movie, but figured out that its sort of free-wheel more or less. It does to its credit have a raw earthy rustic backdrop. 6/10 mixed.",The Rider
23,bandw,Small film packs a punch,9,8 November 2018,"This is the story of Brady Blackburn (Brady Jandreau),
who is trying to rebuild his life after suffering a near fatal head
injury in a saddle bronc riding event in a rodeo. There
are enough themes here to fuel many movies: family, friendship, self
worth, acceptance, personal passion, peer pressure, male identity,
cowboy life. This movie gets into Brady's life so intimately that
it is hard not to identify with him, especially if you have had
events that have redirected your life in unexpected and unwelcome
ways (and who has not?)All of the actors are non-professionals, in fact the story is a slight
fictionalization of the life of Brady Jandreau. Appearing with
Jandreau are his real life father and autistic sister. All of this adds up
to a realism that makes this film almost a documentary. I never felt
any awkwardness that I frequently experience when watching
inexperienced actors.There are many memorable scenes. There is a sequence that has
Jandreau in a ring taming a wild horse. That scene must have been
hell to film, since the camera is right in there. That scene takes
advantage of Jandreau's being a horse trainer in real life--I think no
actor could have pulled it off.Cinematographer Joshua James Richards deserves much credit for
capturing some stunningly beautiful, melancholy shots taken in the
South Dakota Badlands. Much of the movie is filmed in the
Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota.
The scenes having Brady walking by himself
in vast open spaces accentuate his lonely struggle.The scenes that have Brady visiting his physically damaged friend
in a rehab center were almost too painful for me to watch.Brady's dad talked about playing the hand you are dealt in life--
it looked like he was poorly playing a poor hand, but you could
understand him without being too judgmental. A lot of the people
in this movie seem to have been dealt poor hands.The score is effective but unobtrusive.This is a small movie that punches way above its weight.",The Rider
24,guy-bellinger,Thrown to the ground,8,3 March 2021,"Following a serious horse accident, Brady, a young rodeo champion is banned from competition. Back home, he, who lived only for his sport, has to redefine his priorities.Yes, there is rodeo and love of horses in ""The Rider"", and the action takes place in South Dakota, but it is not strictly speaking a western, or let's say it is an intimate western. In fact, it is not the cavalcades or the exchange of gunfire that interests Chloé Zhao, but rather the in-depth description of a milieu (the Pine Ridge Indian reservation), a people (the Oglalas, forgotten by American success) and especially a man, Brady, who, prevented from practicing rodeo, his chosen activity, must first take the blow and then try to find a new meaning to his life. It is a touching portrait that the director paints of this ""Indian cowboy"" in full dismay. And it is with equal sensitivity that she evokes the bonds of tenderness between Brady and nature (superbly filmed), Brady and his horse and especially Brady and his autistic younger sister Lily. The rhythm is more meditative than hectic: the director prefers to leave time to time. If you accept the principle, you will then make the most of this beautiful, authentic and human film.",The Rider
25,frankde-jong,A Western questioning in stead of defining masculinity,7,28 March 2021,"""The rider"" is a special movie in more than one aspect. In the first place a director born in China (Chloé Zhao) comments upon a world as typical American as Rodeo riding. In the second place the film is a mixture of Western and documentary, as the majority of actors is playing his- er herself. The film is located in the Pine Ridge reservation (South Dakota) and the characters are members of the Lakota Sioux indians.Main character Brady Blackburn has had an accident during a rodeo ride which has caused permanent brain damage. It is questionable if he ever can participate in rodeo riding again. His friends are convinced he has to make his come back as soon as possible. Brady himself is a little bit more cautious and keeps talking about a recovering period he is going through. So doing he keeps hanging on to a dream, because to the physicians and also the spectators of the movie it is rather obvious that starting rodeo riding again would be more or less suicidal.Not only Brady has suffered an accident by rodeo riding, the same thing has happened to his friend and mentor Lane Scott. The injuries of Lane are far more serious than that of Brady. Lane is largely paralyzed and stays in a nursing home. The visits of Brady to Lane are the best parts of the movie. Brady is really caring towards Lane but the state Lane is in (much worse than his own) gives him also hope on a comeback. The friends of Brady on the other hand prefer to remember Lane as he once was, because his current state is too threatening for them.So ""The rider"" is about hanging on to a dream, and the director was clever enough not to end the film happily. The dream itself however is all about proving your manhood. An impressive number of symbols of masculinity passes by, such as horses, pistols, tattoo's and drinking. Also the flash backs of Lane before his accident give the impression of a real macho. Normally the Western genre defines masculinity, this is one of the first Westerns I have seen that questions it.As a Dutchman the film somehow reminded me of ""Spetters"" (1980, Paul Verhoeven). ""Spetters"" is about a group of teenagers engaged in motorcycle racing. One of the teenagers has an accident and ends up in a wheelchair. Apart from the similarities (motorcycle racing in stead of rodeo riding to prove your manhood and the accident) there are also big differences. ""Spetters"" is about teenagers, the group of friends of Ray is in their 20's. Chasing women is a remarkable absentee in the symbols of masculinity I mentioned above. In ""Spetters"" it plays an important part. Last but not least ""Spetters"" is about all of a group of friends and does not center so much on the one who has had an accident.",The Rider
26,Jeremy_Urquhart,"Very good, and feels very real",8,10 October 2021,"Chloé Zhao sure knows how to film a landscape, and thankfully The Rider, much like her follow-up, Nomadland, is much more than just a series of pretty images.The pair go together well, because The Rider is similarly slow-paced, and focused more on its central character than it is on a traditional plot. It may feel drawn out at times (it did for me, here and there) but it has a final act full of worthwhile, emotional payoffs, and the beautiful cinematography coupled with the natural dialogue and performances from a cast of non-actors is usually enough to sustain interest during the slower scenes.To some extent you have to give yourself over to a movie like this and be patient, but I think it's a rewarding experience if you're prepared to take that ride (terrible pun very much intended).",The Rider
27,proud_luddite,A daring twist on the macho genre,7,1 July 2018,"In a Lakota Sioux reservation in South Dakota, Brady Blackburn (Brady Jandreau) is recently recovering from brain damage due to a rodeo incident and finds it difficult to adjust to a safer lifestyle as he's not allowed to ride horses any more. Periodically, Brady visits a friend Lane (Lane Scott) in a care facility. Lane was also injured in a rodeo incident but much more severely than Brady.In the genre of ""macho"" films, ""The Rider"" is unique in a couple of ways. Firstly, the movie begins after the injuries rather than leading up to them as climactic moments. Secondly, rather than glorifying the sport of rodeo, it focuses on its aftermath after things go terribly wrong. Director/writer Chloé Zhao is courageous in taking this unconventional approach.""The Rider"" has a very serene quality to it aided by scenes that include beautiful sunrises and sunsets. Its subtle approach to the heartbreak of shattered dreams is slow-moving yet still effective. This film might have been dull but Zhao has a special touch to keep the viewer interested. She is well aided by Jandreau in the lead role, especially as Brady sees the reflection of his strong personality in a horse who is difficult to train. He also personifies the inner strength of the working poor.The film would have been richer if it addressed the issue of cruelty to animals used in rodeo. Despite this shortcoming, it is still a sweet, unconventional film. - dbamateurcritic",The Rider
28,maurice_yacowar,None-actors relive broken rodeo rider's recovery of self-respect,10,21 May 2018,"Remember when America was the light unto nations? Then its independence, principled individualism and the ethical core of the civilization it brought to the frontier all made The Cowboy its natural icon. America was The Cowboy. 
 Sometimes it was the world's sheriff - like Will Kane. Sometimes - like Shane - he was the outlaw breaking from the community - at best, to serve it. 
 But the Cowboy American was always the self-reliant man of principle, truth and honour. He lived and died by the code. He was also at one with his natural world of healthy, sprawling space, wild tameable horses and bursting dawns. He would build for his, his community's and his nation's dream of the future. 
 As the times and America changed, so did the Western film. The genre was inflected to reflect the nation's changing identity - the sweep westward, the building of the railroad, the conquest of the wild, the towns burgeoning into the modern urban, the outside wars, the McCarthyist suspension of American values, their recovery in the revolt against racism, Kennedy's New Frontier. The genre even accommodated the anti-hero spin of the '70s, and ultimately the newer frontier of space, when Star Wars grows out of The Searchers. The Western was the genre for all ages. 
 Understandably, then, when a woman director born in China turns to make a contemporary American western she addresses the dominant current in contemporary America. 
 The story of a broken cowboy - deprived of the macho career on which he based his life and self-worth - reflects a broken America, crippled by its self-destructive and obsolete principles of ""manliness."" Any smack of a swagger seems delusional. 
 In its clarity, humanity and realism this film stands alone in current American cinema. The cast has no actors. From hero Brady, his real father and sister, through his friends and rodeo colleagues, down to the even more broken ex-rodeo star Lane Scott, the performers are living or reliving their lives, not playing roles. 
 If it's sometimes painful to witness such honesty, it's all the more moving and exhilarating. The dialogue doesn't feel scripted. The lighting is natural. The events unfold with constant twists and surprises - like life. There are no formulae here. Whenever we think we know what'll happen - a miracle cure, a new career training horses, a return to the rodeo, whether heroic or fatal - the story squirts away. Like life.
 The actors playing themselves here ring truer than Clint Eastwood's experiment with the real heroes in The 15:17 to Paris. That plot seemed cut to ennoble them. Not here. Mainly, though, none of Eastwood's performers caught the sense of interior life, that the Jandreau family and Lane Scott reveal here. Eastwood's gave their lines and went through the motions. Thanks to director Chloe Zhao these characters are feeling and thinking anew, intensely.
 The sister Lily is especially important. The mother dead, Lily is the only woman in the macho family. She has the purity and innocence of her name. A young girl with functional Asperger's, she's like a mustang in the family. Her words, mind and gestures are wild and unpredictable, but they careen into truth, as her whimsical singing does into beauty. 
 Protecting Lily is an unspoken motive for Brady to keep on living, after his life's passion and purpose are gone. He can't put himself down like his broken horse Apollo. In his first clear sign of understanding his son, Brady's father brings Lily to the rodeo where Brady is intent upon a possibly fatal ride. 
 Some key scenes reach poetic intensity. Brady breaks one horse with quiet delicacy, then a wilder one with a hard aggressiveness. In both cases he shows the sensitivity to realize what the horse needs. He adjusts to his partner. As it happens, the wilder horse is doomed from an unseen battle with a barbed wire fence. 
 In contrast, the once wild Lane Scott is now completely crippled and helpless but he has the spirit to carry on. He has developed a digital system of ""talking"" to Brady. They watch Lane's old rodeo success videos with more relish for what he was then than feeling reduced by what he is now. Brady takes Lane through rehab parodies of riding, which proves as useful a rehab for Brady as for Lane. He finds another reason to live.
 The broken Lane delivers the film's most resonant, but ambivalent, line:""Don't give up on your dream."" Sounds good. But coming from a helpless, crippled man, that's hardly good advice. 
 That lesson may seem constructive but it's not. Lane's watching his old videos is not pursuing his dream but re-viewing the dream that died. Remembering the dashed dream may provide some consolation, but he can't ""pursue"" it any more. 
 Perhaps this is Zhao's key message to her adopted America: Don't be seduced into pursuing an impossible dream, a dream unrelated to reality. Pursuing his dream would take Brady on ride after ride till he's killed. 
 Instead, perhaps, pursue your dream as long as you can, but adapt to reality. Brady fulfills his life not by pursuing his childhood rodeo dream but by accepting the adult responsibilities of staying alive and helping Lily and Lane. 
 For America, that lesson translates to developing an awareness of one's self and one's situation, within its borders and beyond. Adjust the dream to reality and steer clear of the snake oil salesmen and cons who play on your vanity and offer to recover a past that you either can't or shouldn't. 
 The ""American Dream"" - the promise that anyone can become anything they want in America - was never a guarantee. With that pitch, a con plunged the nation into its current nightmare. 
 There's another tacit lesson in the circle of Brady's rodeo friends. Nothing is made of this, but it's clearly there. His friends are a comfortable mix of indigenous Americans, Latino, Mexican. That's the classic melting pot - that's really what made America great. 
 Indeed, the America based on human rights, freedom, equality and democratic values and government, that dream - currently suspended - is worth pursuing.

30,dave-mcclain,both boring and touching,5,30 April 2018,"""The Rider"" (R, 1:44) is a western drama written and directed by Chloé Zhao, who discovered the story (and the characters who lived it) while researching her first feature, 2015's ""Songs My Brothers Taught Me"". Her 2017 effort (which transitioned from the festival circuit to limited releases in several countries in early 2018) is the story of a cowboy who suffered a career-ending rodeo injury and is deciding what to do with the rest of his life. The film stars the title character as himself - and his family as themselves.Brady Jandreau (looking like a young and lean Heath Ledger) plays the titular cowboy. Training and riding horses is what he loves and all he knows. After a devastating fall from a horse, he has a gash on the side of his head, his skin and his skull held together with staples. He struggles through his recovery - and to get used to the idea that he may never ride again. He's not sure whether he can give it up, in spite of the risk to his health and his life. He takes a job in a grocery store, but keeps gravitating back to horses. As he works through his issues, there's no shortage of advice - from those who want him to ride again - and those who know he can't, while caught in the middle is his family - his dad and his mentally challenged sister - and the person he admires most, a fellow rider who is permanently paralyzed.""The Rider"" is both touching and boring. Although this very personal and realistic story sheds light on the lives of modern cowboys, the whole thing is very slow and uneventful... for most of the film's runtime. However, along the way, something surprising happens. The tedium is gradually replaced by something emotional and relatable. It is then that Movie Fans realize that the time spent getting to know these characters and understanding this way of life has made them invested in the story, which pays dividends before it's over. Of course, the main actors playing themselves (not to mention the people playing the smaller roles) yield some acting that is less than stellar, but everyone and everything in this film feels raw and real, and for those Movie Fans who can make it through the slow parts in this slice-of-life western, they may well feel like they have won the gold buckle themselves.

31,AhmedSpielberg99,Very Moving......... And Very Boring!,7,18 August 2018,"There is a lot to like about The Rider; The cinematography is gorgeous, with a lot of shots showing the treeless meadows that reflect the protagonist's feeling of loss and emptiness.
Brady Jandreau's acting is so genuine and honest.
There are some truly great moments that will make you instantly engaged with every character in them. I don't even want to say anything about these scenes, I don't even want to mention the characters they include, because they are unbelievably effective and very poignant.
The movie's message of perseverance and determination also should be considered and appreciated.The grave issue I have with this movie is its tone.
I love character-driven stories, because they make me close to the main character. In other words, they put me in the protagonist's shoes, or even make me inside his mind. But The Rider's tone is so lifeless, and the story is almost uneventful. Of course, the movie should reflect the gloominess and bleakness of its subject matter, but the tone doesn't pick up even when the story do. Add to that, the movie lacks in dramatic intensity. Aside from some very touching scenes that can break your heart even if you haven't seen the entire film, the movie is so boring and phlegmatic. Honestly, I was bored most of the time while watching it. The dialogue also could have been better. it's so weak and clichéd.All the performances are good, especially Brady Jandreau as Brady Blackburn, except for the actor who played his dad. His acting is very weak as his bland and flat character.I had mixed feelings about The Rider. I found it monotonous, and I was bored to death. Nevertheless, I cared about the main character and almost every character around it, I appreciated its message, I was fascinated by its stunning cinematography, and I adored its tear-jerking ending.(7/10)",The Rider
32,Blue-Grotto,Authentic and Heart-rending,8,11 October 2017,"The joy of doing what you love burns away any pain. For Brady, a rodeo rider who just emerged from a coma, the joy and pain come in equal measure. Brady is told not to ride again. ""Play the cards you are dealt,"" says his father ""let it go."" Yet Brady's purpose in life is hitched to riding horses. Also, living in a trailer and eating rabbit soup is not the stuff of champions. In the starlight, around a campfire with friends, listening to his little sister sing simple yet beautiful songs, and in dreams, Brady ponders his next moves.This authentic and heart-rending film integrates the real lives of the actors into the story. It is balanced in its portrayal and rightly does not cast judgment. The cinematography is up close and intimate so that emotions are revealed in faces and eyes (horse and human) as much as words. While the director, actors and horses are just starting out in their film making careers and it shows, there is power and magic in how genuine they are in their portrayals. In a sense, they have been preparing for this film their entire lives. Human nature and the real West are on display here, and there is as much beauty in that as there is in the prairie sunrise.

36,rubenm,"They ride horses, don't they?",7,2 April 2018,"While watching the end credits of this film, I noticed that Brady Jandreau is mentioned twice: as the lead actor, and as the horse trainer. It's a way of telling the audience that Jandreau is, in fact, playing himself, or at least a version of his personality. Brady Jandreau - only his last name is changed for his movie role - is a rodeo rider who is recovering from a near-fatal head injury. Doctors tell him he should never ride again, but after having spent some weeks working in a supermarket, he comes to the conclusion that there's only one thing that makes him happy: riding rodeo's. It's a simple story, but it is told with lots of empathy for the heart wrenching choices Brady has to make. We can see him wrestling with his fate and in the end, he knows that he is meant to ride horses, 'just as a horse is meant to run across the prairie'. There are several side stories deepening the insight in Brady's predicament. His teenage sister is mentally challenged, the family is poor and lives in a trailer, and he has to say goodbye to two of his favorite horses. The film can be interpreted as a heroic tale of perserverence and dedication. Brady lives for the rodeo, and the viewer understands why he gets a kick out of the horses, the clothing, the masculinity and the competition. The director indicates this in subtle scenes. For example when he decides to pawn his custom made saddle, because he needs the money. At the last moment, he changes his mind. But you can also interpret this film a a sad story of a man who has only limited possibilities in life because of the environment he grows up in. Brady really has nothing else in his life, and is not capable of even imagining changing it. One of the saddest scenes in the film is when Brady visits another rodeo hero, who is paralyzed for life after a fall, and lives in a care facility. Helped by three assistants, Brady lifts his friend on a wooden horse, puts a cowboy hat on his head and makes him move as if he is riding a horse. Even this terrible example doesn't deter Brady from continuing rodeo riding. The cinematograpy is beautiful, with plenty of shots showing the treeless prairies of the empty American heartland in all its beauty. It also gives a nice insight into the rodeo world, a cultural phenomenon as essential to the American West as bull fighting is to Spain. But it's essentially a film about a man fighting the odds to do what he wants to do.",The Rider

The setting is clearly established and the varied cast of secondary characters make it feel alive and give the audience a clear sense of the environment that shaped Brady. Honestly, it would be relatively effective as a slice of life movie of a cowboy, as the details of the heartland and the sport of rodeo are fascinating. What makes The Rider a technical success is Jandreau's performance and the scenes and detail Zhao builds around him. Each interaction adds depth to his character, and the camera really captures minutiae of his reactions and emotions. Zhao portrays mental disability and physical disability beautifully. The element that made me love The Rider is the larger questions it asks, and the real, human answers it provides. The question of how much are you willing to risk to pursue the thing you love versus being safe and being there for the people you love was so powerful. I felt so emotionally invested in Brady's struggle and saw both sides of it. The scene with his dad near the end had many layers to it, and then the scene immediately after at the rodeo blew me away and was the scene of the movie for me.

Throw in a gorgeous cinematography and you have one of the most memorable films I have seen in years.The Rider focuses on a family, and particularly one son who after an unfortunate competition accident, is stuck not just in a sea of empty direction, but a loss of his true identity. He is guided by other riding friends, a somewhat dis-interested father, and his disabled younger sister.This film could be filed with obvious tropes, the big Karate Kid like comeback, family redemption, but instead it has the unique ability to keep things intensely real. The characters don't even seem like they are acting, there is a real sense of the Western camaraderie and landscape out on the plains, a Holden Caulfieldesque genuine relationship with a sister so real as if Salinger wrote it himself, and a look into a culture that has been updated for the 21st century.The cinematography along with the main characters angst, ooze off the screen in burnt and dark rolling hills of pathos and glory. The images and storyline offer such an intense look in a life that many can only barely grasp. The movie's effect is so striking, that in a particular scene when a simple horse is ridden, it is one of the beautiful, haunting, majestic and gut wrenching images you will ever witness on screen.Director Chloe Zhao has crafted one of the most amazing looking and storytelling pieces of Americana in ages, while lead actor Brady Jandreau pulls off a character and role with such passion and ease, it's as if he was a modern James Dean and John Wayne all rolled up into one.A not to be missed film.",The Rider

Set in the same location in South Dakota, featuring the same milieu, and covering some of the same thematic ground, The Rider also owes a more practical debt to Songs. When she was researching that film, Zhao met rodeo rider Brady Jandreau, who taught her how to ride a horse. Promising him she would cast him in one of her subsequent films, Zhao soon learned that Jandreau had sustained a serious cranial injury in a rodeo accident, and been told by doctors that he must give up the only way of life he had ever known, as another blow to the head could kill him. Inspired by his story, Zhao wrote The Rider, a loosely fictionalised version of Jandreau's experiences, in which she cast entirely non-professional actors, including the real Jandreau, his father, sister, and several of his friends, all playing versions of themselves. The result is a kind of semi-fictional docudrama, and one of the finest films of the year.Set on the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota, Brady Blackburn (Brady Jandreau) lives just above the poverty line with his father Wayne (Tim Jandreau) and his sister Lilly (Lilly Jandreau), who suffers from autism. Several months previously, Brady suffered a near-fatal head injury after falling from a bronco, which has left him with neurological damage. Warned by doctors that if he attempts to ride again, a single innocuous fall could kill him, Brady finds his very sense of self challenged as he attempts to function in a society where every man lives by the maxim of ""ride or die"".In depicting Brady's struggle with his new life, Zhao is able to simultaneously romanticise and demythologise the role of the cowboy in the contemporary United States. As the story progresses, the film comes more and more to express a sense of disillusionment with the lifestyle. Part of this is the theme of the rodeo itself. So eloquently panegyrised in the early parts of the film, it is also presented as leading to physical ruin and mental anguish. Indeed, one of the film's primary motifs is that of injuries sustained whilst riding. In relation to this, it's extremely telling that literally every male Brady meets, from young boys to elderly men, all express their desire that he start riding again, although many of them know why he stopped. On the other hand, one of the few female characters tells him, ""problem with you boys, you don't like to get your pride hurt"". Brady and his friends are personifications of the ruggedness of the American West, and the film uses them to facilitate a deconstruction of the notions of contemporary masculinity.They see themselves as modern day-cowboys, but the film argues this is an era where cowboys serve no function. But this is the only life they have known, and whilst the film leaves the audience in little doubt that this lifestyle can lead to ruin, so too does it ensure the viewer knows that Zhao has the deepest respect for these guys, depicting, as it does, the kind of desperation and limited choices that leave a young man with only one route, a route which often overrides any common sense he may have. Never once does it feel like Zhao is looking down on or satirising them. Rather, it's criticising the situation in which they find themselves; forced to live a life of bluster and posturing.The most telling example of this is Lane (Lane Scott). As with the real-life Brady, Lane was a celebrated rodeo with a reputation for riding broncos no one else would touch. The embodiment of machismo with a devil-may-care attitude, he was adored by women and envied by men. However, as in the film, the real Lane is now almost completely paralysed, capable of communicating only by signing with his left hand, and living permanently in a care facility. The only difference between the real-life Lane and his fictional counterpart is that in reality, he was paralysed in a car crash, whereas in the film it was via riding. This differentiation is telling as it speaks to Zhao's thematic intent. However, as with the other riders, Lane is presented with a great deal of reverence, and never does it feel like the film is saying, ""look at what the rodeo did to this guy; he must be a total idiot.""In a sense, whilst the film partially recalls The Misfits (1961), its real thematic precursor is The Wrestler (2008), an examination of male pride working against common sense, of professional dedication, of machoism gone awry. As with The Wrestler, the story of The Rider is archetypal. The Wrestler was about wrestling, but it could have been about any sport, and The Rider is even more universal. Yes, it too could have been about any sport, but it could also have been about literally any environ in which a young male tries to balance the dangers of what he does with the possibility of some kind of reward (whether financial or spiritual) at the end of it all.Looking at things aesthetically, the film opens with a shot of a horse during a storm, followed by loud thunder. The immediate impression is one of almost elemental forces - two extremes of nature coming together. This is immediately contrasted with Brady waking up and heading into his dingy bathroom to pluck off the staples holding the bandage on his still raw head wound. Thus, in just two shots, Zhao sets up the entire theme of the film - poetic rhetoric and romantic myths are all very well and good, but day to day mundanity can so often get in the way.Elsewhere, the centrepiece of the film, and probably the most beautiful sequence, is when Brady decides the only opportunity of which he can avail to allow him to stay around horses without risking his life is to break in young broncos. The single-take shot where he breaks in an ""untrainable"" horse is searingly beautiful in its simplicity and elegance. The lack of edits gives it an unmanipulated emotional sense, whilst also meaning there can be no cheating - we're really watching Brady Jandreau break in a stubborn horse. The gentle approach he employs, the constant reassurances to the animal, the way he holds the rope, how he gets the horse used to someone on its back without actually getting all the up, his grace and intuition, his confidence; the totality is, simply put, achingly perfect. What we are seeing obviously comes from a deep natural inclination in the real-life Brady. You can't teach this kind of brilliance, no matter what the discipline is. Indeed, his gentle approach itself is completely at variance with such scenes in other westerns, where we're usually shown someone breaking in a horse by forcing it to respect them, and that in itself speaks as much to Zhao's theme as anything else. It's this sense of docudrama/realism/naturalism, whatever you want to call it, that really makes The Rider stand out.If I had one criticism, it would be that the film runs out of momentum a little in the third quarter, although it picks up again in the last 20 minutes or so. However, aside from that, I literally cannot find a bad thing to say.Bleak but incredibly beautiful, honest, but deeply respectful, realistic but profoundly poetic, Zhao's depiction of a dying culture, a dying breed, a dying way of life - the adrenaline-junkie bronco riders, America's modern cowboys - is easily one of the finest films of the year. And how ironic is it that one of the best examinations of American masculinity that you're likely to see in a long time is written and directed by a woman? And a woman born in China to boot. That's sure to irritate the misogynists/xenophobes no end!",The Rider
44,scb_coldsteel,Slow yet satisfying character study,8,1 October 2018,"So I just got out of the theater seeing the movie The Rider. I didn't know much about it other than it had good reviews from critics and received a standing ovation from the Cannes film festival. Overall I was very impressed.The movie has a very minimalistic barebones plot involving a young rodeo star who becomes injured and must reevaluate his life. While doing so the movie examines ideas of masculinity, rural poverty, determinism, and concepts of self. It was both a simple and deep movie on many levels.One of the most unique features of the film was the cast. The stars of the film were not actors but people who lived the story of the film. I know this has been tried before with mixed results, but Brady Jandreau the star of the movie was incredible. He brought forth such a gritty and raw portrayal of the role that could only come from living those experiences. You really felt the pain and hardships this man has gone through in his life. Plus he was absolutely captivating working with the horses since he was an experienced horse trainer.On top of that the cinematography was outstanding. In a lot of ways the movie made the setting an important character to the movie. It was a great example of what can be done even on a minimal budget in the hands of a talented artist.My only real criticisms of the movie being the pacing was a tad bit slow at times and for a few roles the movie could have benefited from a couple trained actors. It was all around a unique and interesting movie worth watching. A 8.5 out of 10.",The Rider
45,ccorral419,This Indie film is why I love this genre of filmmaking,10,30 May 2018,"This rewarding Indie film is why I love this genre of filmmaking. Director/Writer Chloe Zhao (""Songs My Brother Taught Me"" 2015) continues her fascination with the Indian culture, presenting an honest coming of age film set in the Dakota's (casting several actors from the reservation) that is filled with dashed dreams, self determination, family, friendship and growing up. Casting the actual Jandreau's family in several of the leading roles here, was a gamble that pays off in the film honesty. Newcomer Brady Jandreau eats up the screen as Brady Blackburn, a young cowboy permanently injured from a rodeo fall who must find his identity off the circuit. Surrounding him are fellow recovering injured riders Cat Clifford (playing himself), Victor Chasing Hawk (Derrick Janis) and Tanner Langdeau (playing himself). Their scene out on the evening prairie talking about their injuries is pure movie magic. As a backdrop, Brady is reminded what a serious injury looks and feel like, as he himself supports his pal Lane (played by ex-bull rider and real auto accident survivor Lane Scott). If that's not enough, home life is equally as trying, with a distant father (Tim Jandreau) and autistic sister Lilly (Lily Jandreau). Under Zhao's watchful eye and realistic writing, the actors give performances that cement the films authenticity. Cinematography by Joshua James Richards, beautifully captures the rodeo life and miles of wonderful prairie horizons. Score by Nathan Halpern enables the viewer to melt into everything that is presented on screen. And, if you're an equestrian enthusiast, this film is just for you!

Its centers the story on an young working class man trying to get a grip on his ""manhood"" via a surrogate ""family"" of diverse characters (not to be picky, but some of the acting was little off/over the top). The film's strength is the juxtaposed imagery belonging both to the ""serene"" rural landscape and the ""hyper-masculine"" subculture of rodeo. It explores visually the ""rites of passage"" for young rodeo riders, held steadily by the newly found acting talents of Brady Jandreau.

48,vsks,"One of the best movies of 2018 so far: authentic, fresh, heartfelt",10,5 June 2018,"The movie The Rider isn't really about rodeo. It's a character study and an exploration of what it means to lose your dreams, and how to be a man in a culture that glorifies danger. Writer-Director Chloé Zhao may have been born in Beijing, but she has made one of the most authentic films about the West in recent years and one of the best films of the year so far. Don't miss it!
She's drawn on the real-life story of a young man's recovery from a rodeo injury that nearly killed him and probably will if he falls again. Brady Blackburn (played by Brady Jandreau) had a solid career on the rodeo circuit in front of him. As the film opens, his skull looks like Frankenstein's monster, a metal plate rides underneath, and he has an occasional immobililty in his right hand-his rope hand. The doctor tells him no more riding, no more rodeo. She might as well tell him not to breathe.
He's ""recuperating,"" but determined to get back in the saddle. He lives in a trailer with his father (Tim Jandreau), who puts on a gruff front, and feisty 15-year-old sister, Lilly (Lilly Jandreau), who has some degree of Asperger's. The disappointment his fans feel when they find him working at a supermarket is visible to the taciturn Brady and to us.
In his spare time-and this is where the movie comes spectacularly to life-he trains horses. Watching him work with them, you know for sure that he's no actor. This is his real-life job, and Zhao has captured those delicate moments of growing trust. 
Not that interested in rodeo? You don't see much of it. And most of the rodeo scenes are in the video clips Brady and his best friend Lane watch. Watching them watching is the bittersweet point. Lane was a star bull-rider now unable to walk or speak. The way Brady interacts with him is full of true generosity and mutual affection.
When Brady throws his saddle into the truck to go to another rodeo, in vain his father tells him not to. The father accuses him of never listening to him, and Brady says, ""I do listen to you. I've always listened to you. It's you who said, 'Cowboy up,' 'Grit your teeth,' 'Be a man,'"" the kinds of messages men give their sons that sometimes boomerang back to break their hearts.
Cinematographer James Joshua Richards's deft close-in camerawork captures the personalities of the horses, and his wide views put the windswept grasslands of South Dakota's Badlands and Pine Ridge Indian Reservation. The film is shot partly on the Lakota reservation, but not much is made of the cast's Native American heritage. By grounding the script in Brady's real-life recovery and by surrounding him with his real-life family and friends, Zhao creates a wholly natural feel for the film, which has been nominated for five Independent Spirit Awards.
And what was it like for Brady to work with the filmmaker? ""She was able to step into our world: riding horses, moving cows, stuff like that. Why should we be scared to step foot into her world?"" he said in a Vanity Fair story by Nicole Sperling. ""She would do things like get on a 1,700-pound animal for us. And trust us. So we did the same. We got on her 1,700-pound animal.""",The Rider

It is easily in my all time top ten movies ; for its authenticity , tender story telling , subtlety, simplicity and directness.(as a reference or comparison think of "" I Know this Much is True "" The HBO series with Mark Ruffalo ) So much better than so many films that get the hype and attention of people in' the business ' What can I say ? you really ought to watch this movie, I promise you will not forget it.",The Rider

The acting when the characters are just acting like cowboys and not talking to each other about their problems is phenomenal. The problem is that this isn't a cowboy documentary, it's a drama. Most of the cast, to my knowledge, are actual cowboys so naturally they act well as themselves. Unfortunately, the script comes off as unnatural often.

Unable to mount up again, Brady goes on a journey of self-discovery while looking after his financially stricken sister and father in the harsh South Dakota badlands.What elevates the film's already strong story is the decision to cast a real family of bronc riders instead of professional actors in the main roles. As they draw on their own experiences in bringing the script to life, The Rider feels hauntingly real in its depiction of a hard-bitten way of life. While some parts in the middle feel a little slow, by the end the film leaves a devastating emotional impact that lingers long after. A definite highlight of the festival so far.",The Rider
56,nehpetstephen,A strong story in a flawed film,6,26 July 2018,"In The Rider, South Dakota's stirring pastures have been gorgeously lensed by Joshua James Richards, who also shot the overcast rural landscapes of Yorkshire in 2017's God's Own Country. The Rider is a beautiful film to look at, its authentic vision set against a minimalist score by Nathan Halpern. It helps that star Brady Jandreau, playing a version of himself (as are all the actors here, it seems), is handsome and subtly charismatic.But the film sputters throughout its running time, especially in the first half. I have no doubt that what I've seen in The Rider is a very close and faithful account of reality--this is what these people wear, what they believe, how they talk, what they dream of, what misfortunes befall them, etc.--yet something about writer/director Chloé Zhao's style makes so much of this movie feel fake. For instance, there is a scene early in the film where Brady and three of his young friends drive out into the middle of the prairie to get drunk, play the guitar, take turns jumping over a bonfire, and hang out. All the details of this situation are, I'm sure, 100% accurate, yet the manner in which they take turns telling very detailed, narratively clear, expository stories about the worst times each of them was injured at a rodeo seems explicitly false. Is this how close friends talk to each other? Surely they've heard about these injuries before--in fact, I wouldn't be surprised if they were all there to witness each one. Of course sometimes with friends we reminisce about the details of significant events that have happened to us, even if none of that is ""news"" to any of us, yet I couldn't help but feel that the way in which this scene unfolds in The Rider is simply because Zhao needed an easy way to guarantee that her viewers would understand the physical stakes of being a rodeo rider. And when it seems so blatant that the things I'm seeing on screen are only happening because there's a director right behind the camera--especially in a movie that strives for realism/naturalism like this one--it's hard for me to become fully invested.That's one example, but there are frequent moments like that throughout the film. I wonder if Brady's story and Zhao's purposes would have been better served if she had simply made an over-the-shoulder documentary instead of striving for whatever narrative nonfiction thing this movie would be characterized as. It might've required a lot more footage, but I'm sure the payoff would have been more genuine.In any case, what's here is certainly worth a look, and certain other memorable scenes--such as one in which Brady wrestles with a teenager who's just beginning to aspire to be a rodeo rider--don't possess the weakness I've just described. More importantly, the story's message is thought-provoking, meaningful, and nicely nuanced. Brady lives in a world where there are narrow expectations, opportunities, and pathways in life for the humans who inhabit it, and even fewer for the horses who live with them. What happens when a cruel twist of fate slams several of those already limited doors shut? How can dignity remain in a world that's been designed to close out those who are impaired? Where can sources of hope and support be found in a world that's not very amenable to change or difference? The Rider grapples with these questions in a resonant and authentic way, even if the movie isn't always as effective as it could've been.",The Rider

Drawing most of the film from a handful of actors that the story is based on, lined up the film to fall on pretty flimsy shoulders. Good thing for the Rider and for Chloe Zhao, they brought their A-game and not only that, they provided authenticity and understanding to everything they were acting, because it was all real to them.
 In many scenes you follow the main character Brady through him accomplishing cowboy tasks, where in all actuality he is just doing what he has done his whole life. Where the film excels in the scenes where he is having to bring emotion and storytelling to the film. In these scenes, which are most of the film, he provides a wonderful performance that is hard to match from a first-time actor. From long takes, and truly emotional scenes and relationships, Brady Jandreau may find himself asked for more roles.

I did not identify with this at all as a riding movie.

I don't think this is a movie for horse lovers.  I think we were supposed to come away from this film with an appreciation of the American West or something. In reality rodeos are entertainment and real cowboys did/do real work of herding cattle etc. I felt sorry for several of the characters, but I also saw them as macho types who make poor decisions.

Sure it's considered a movie; a presentation of a story. A group of people known as CAST & CREW coming together to create a visual work of art. However this was nothing like Ike I'd seen before. 
 The actual story bro g made with a followed script, yet much better than any Oscar nominee I've watched. I guess the thing about this movie that got me is that I know this type of life. I know these kinds of people. I don't know a thing about movie making. But I know life and THIS IS LIFE. Perhaps not the life of what Hollywood producers like to sell.

It says much of Zhao's abilities that she manages to find a form with which to tell the tale of such an unassuming figure as Brady Blackburn (Brady Jandreu), in a way that manages to remain true to the quiet stubbornness of this protagonist.At the start of the film Brady, a rodeo riding champion, has suffered a near-fatal fall, that has left him unable to return to the saddle without potentially fatal consequences. Brady has monetary commitments to his dad and his sister, that his injury has now prevented him from being able to meet. What is more his intuitive understanding of horses and the simpatico he felt for them has been undermined by the accident. Zhao plots an arc for Brady, that is full of potentially tragic material, but is ultimately about a broken rider feeling his way back into the saddle and working out what he can now do with the life he is lucky to have. The nuanced way in which Zhao chronicles the rodeo culture of South Dakota, as well as the way of life of those people that inhabit the peripheral reservations of the Badlands, has an insiders empathy, feeling and understanding for these communities. Zhao chose to work with a cast of people who aren't professional actors and who actually inhabit the rodeo circuit, Brady's father and sister are played by Jandreau's real-life father and sister. Moreover, one of Jandreau's close friends on the rodeo circuit, Lane Scott is featured as himself, a man invalided by a car accident, that has robbed him of his unparalleled abilities as a rodeo rider.Rarely, have I come across a drama that feels so unforced and at ease with its protagonists low-key personal drama. This is perhaps what makes those central sequences where Brady gets back in to the saddle and shows he still has the connection with the animal that he loves, so powerful and potent. These are simply moments of a man doing what he was meant to do, doing what he loves and there is something incredibly compelling about watching them.",The Rider
65,Smallclone100,The #1 film of 2018,9,28 November 2018,"Where to start with The Rider......it's good. It's very good, but it is overly sentimental in parts. There are certain elements that just seem to be trying a little too hard to tweak emotions. But that's the only bad thing I can say about it. From here on in, we're only talking goodness.This is almost an experimental hyper real concept film. Real life South Dakotan Rodeo folk playing themselves, in a loose, fictionalized version of events that happened a few years ago. And it's extraordinarily well done. I have absolutely no idea how Director Chloé Zhao got the actors to act like they did, other than to just be themselves I guess. Which is literally what they were doing. The story focuses on Brady, a talented Rodeo rider who is recovering from serious injury (played by Brady Jandreau). Then his father is played by his real life father (Tim Jandreau). His sister is played his actual sister.....and so on.There are some heart-breaking scenes in which Brady goes to visit an old friend Lane Scott, played by....Lane Scott, who has some real life history of his own that probably needs looking up after you've watched the movie.The plot and substance of the movie itself focuses on the tough lives of Rodeo communities in the Pine Ridge Reservation area. The harsh, unforgiving reality and pressures of life are shown as well as how important family and friendship is.'God's Own Country' was near the top of my movie list last year, and the same DoP Joshua James Richards nails it again here. There are some truly stunning shots of the landscape as well as some really tender moments showing Brady's highs and lows. There is one particular scene where Brady breaks in a horse for a farmer that is hugely compelling. I couldn't take my eyes off the screen it was so real. At this early stage I'm tempted to rate it as a 9 out of 10.It is a huge achievement.",The Rider

I do not usually like sad stories. I firmly believe that movies should first entertain and then teach a lesson just like the best children's story. This is sometimes painful to watch but you have to root for Brady Blackburn. The shots of the Badlands are spectacular, the emotion heartfelt and the filmmaker's vision realized.",The Rider
67,AIOS-Reviews,Take Some Moments To Cry Yourselves,9,3 January 2019,"I'm very tiny to review this film. Even anyone can't give it a proper rating. The Rider is one of such film that tells us to live. But not like we are living everyday. The film has a soul that is not possible to feel to everyone.It's the story of a cowboy who is badly injured now. He can't go back to his horse riding dream. And as usually he is fainted. Slowly the film moves through the eyes of the cowboy. He doesn't know what he is doing. But he is sure of what he is not doing.For the 1 hour and 38 min I could not realize that I was watching a film and they were all acting. So if I talk about the acting then everyone is masterclass. And from the cinematography to score The Rider is a real winner. It's kind of near perfect movie that you don't watch everyday.Above all The Rider is a film to experience. It's definitely not gonna entertain you but whatever impact it will play on your life, In one word it's 'Priceless'.",The Rider
68,jc-999-591106,Great Movie,9,22 January 2019,"I give The Rider an 8.5, not quite a nine so I rounded down. This is a very personal story about life, loss and perseverance. Brady has a severe head injury from a riding incident where he got bucked off and his head was stomped. He is living with his father who is a tough character with a few vices that lead to further problems for Brady. He also lives with his younger sister who is developmentally delayed but very strong willed, like all of the family. He also has an older brother who broke his back/neck riding and is semi-paralyzed.Brady's family and friends are all really well developed characters and the film feels like a documentary, but better.This is a great hidden gem and if you get the chance to see it, then see it.",The Rider

70,hughrcarson,What is more important: authenticity or technical acting ability?,6,18 October 2018,"Brady Blackburn (Brady Jandreau), is firmly of the opinion that his career as a rodeo rider is merely on hold whilst he recuperates from the fall and severe head injury that he recently sustained in action.And though inundated with the encouragement and well wishes of others, it quickly becomes clear to all that any sort of come back from this would be both short-lived and eminently foolhardy.With this realisation in mind, Brady must now somehow try to find renewed meaning in an existence that has for his entire life been intrinsically linked to the life of a cowboy. But living in a remote rural location bereft of any real employment opportunities and with little by way of alternative education and skill sets to call upon, the odds are somewhat stacked against him.Even his efforts to use the highly impressive skills he possesses as a horse trainer - passed down to him by his father - seem doomed to failure as the neurological impact of his injury begins to manifest itself physically, hampering his ability to properly carry out even this somewhat less physically demanding work. Indeed, Brady is informed that if he ever attempts to ride again, it could very well kill him.It's only then through the relationship that he has with his developmentally-disabled sister Lilly, and severely disabled friend, Lane Scott - himself an ex-rodeo rider - that Brady can then take stock of his life and begin to see beyond everything that he has ever been and ever thought he would be.It's a thoughtful and atmospheric film that's ever so beautifully shot, making full use of the raw, wind-swept beauty of the South Dakota badlands. And through Zhao's gritty, visceral and highly textural approach to the direction, one can almost feel the creaking well-worn leather of Brady's saddle, and the cold steel of the stirrups that hang securely from it.Given their real-life talents and abilities with horses, through taking the risk of casting Brady Jandreau and his co-actors in the film's leading roles, Chloe Zhao's film positively brims with vigour, energy and above all authenticity.But The Rider then presents its audience with something of a conundrum:What is more important in a performance? Authenticity or technical acting ability?For all of the honest, earthy qualities that the cast undoubtedly bring to the table, it is ultimately the limitations of their ability as actors - failing at times to fully convey the necessary emotions and conviction required - that frequently hamper the film's best intentions.And what a very great shame that is.It's really not out of all proportion to suggest that given the right choice of cast, The Rider would have had all of the necessary ingredients to be considered something bordering on a masterpiece.As it is, Zhao's film fails to convince as a whole, and falls frustratingly short of what it might have been.Harsh? Perhaps. But one cannot tip-toe around the truth here.The Rider is as authentic, thoughtful, heartfelt and soulful as the day is long, but ultimately it's what would appear to be the film's greatest assets that ultimately prove to be its unfortunate undoing.",The Rider
71,fimdb-69588,Scale down your expectations and maybe you will like this film.,7,23 February 2021,"In the realm of low budget independent films, this film is a standout and worthy of 10 stars. But in the entire realm, a 7 at best. The film drags at times, but it makes up for it with the intensity it brings by using amateur actors who are largely re-enacting their authentic real life stories. The film isn't a documentary, but it uses a lot of the same elements as a documentary with just the right touch of artistic embellishment and drama. It's hard not to like the lead character, Brady, as he struggles to put his life back together from a near fatal injury. For an amateur actor, Brady Jandreau portrays the life of Brady Blackburn with surprising intensity. Perhaps the director deserves a lot of credit for Brady's performance but I suspect we will see more of Brady Jandreau in other films. I believe his next role is in pre-production as I am writing this review.",The Rider
72,rcnaylor,"Good story, cinematography, fair movie",5,2 June 2018,"This one is a reminder of the many parts it takes to make a good movie. And, that a miss on a part often results in ""a miss is as good as a mile."" Here the story is a good one and well worth telling. It has substance of content that the vast majority of movies today can't touch. Men engaging in the passing art of rodeoing and the toughness that takes, and the toll it often extracts. The cinematography is also well done. It does a good (not great) job of capturing the rough, and beautiful, country the rodeoers inhabit. Worth the price of admission alone. However, the acting is basic level and the story telling is slow to the point of snoozing. The plot, while full of drama on its own, still misses the kind of dramatic devices most really good drama movies incorporate. It was more like a day in the life kind of device than a major motion picture. A day in the life of Americana worth seeing in a place worth seeing. Lives that are dramatic in their own low key struggle sort of way. Expect that going in and you can enjoy this movie for what it is.

75,indiapaige,Art imitates life brilliantly thru unprecendented representation.,9,4 September 2018,"Writer/Director Chloe Zhao has created a meaningful sensitive film in The Rider.
Fable or truth be told, while filming on and near Oglala-Lakota Pine Ridge, South Dakota, the filmmakers actual horse trainer and wrangler was to become the protagonist in her next film. The real life adventures of Brady Blackburn(Jandreau) served as more than dramatic inspiration for this films beautifully developed story. 
Horse people go to horse films. They laugh and note added sound effects, the silliness of non riding actors surrounded by adept professional horseman, the edited missteps of four hooved actors missing their unknown marks. In The Rider, Chloe serves the horse community well here. Ms Zhau perhaps didn't understand the larger community still who were to be drawn to this film.Importantly and overlooked by other reviews, this is the first film to treat members of America's disabled community well, respectfully, realistically, and unprecedented. Apart from Lane Scott (Bradys more severely traumatized rodeo brother), casting protagonist Brady Jandreau and real life sister Lilly Jandreau as lead and supporting actors was not only risky, it was poetic. In ground breaking performances for all three the choice paid off tremendously. In present cinematographic times, casting a south american actor for a polyneisan role creates backlash, hence any attempts to cast someone to play a character with TBI was bound to fall short. What we see is a fair and balanced look into stoicism, disappointments, life adjustments beyond the trauma being craftily captured in cinematographer Joshua Richards lenses as portrayed through Brady's expressive facial featuresTo cowboy up requires readers here accepting we're all only one ride away from possible life changing traumatic injury or other physical limitations to ones life plans or young persons dreams.
I cant think of another performing arts piece grabbing this reality theme for poetic exploration. 
In The Rider, viewers are treated to breath taking cinema-graphic beauty that's the film's backdrop of the Lakota Oglala Pine Ridge landscape, juxtaposed with the rural plains states sparsity of nearby remedy. Counterpoint to Bradys choices following his accident, is a devoted enduring freindship with his longtime rodeo cohort Lane, who's previous rodeo injury lead to his living in a Nebraska based assisted living facility. Once more Chloe Zhao captures the essences of Lanes and Bradys friendship with just enough detail to Lanes disability as required by the narrative, without taking viewers by the hand and leading them through the day to day methodology of learning american sign language; nor learning the biomechanics of Bradys post traumatic siezures or Lillys speech pathology. The choices of script, scenes, post production editing reveal to an ablest audience the most tasteful elements of life including challenges of managing life with disabilities.
Its taken at least five generations of american filmmaking to correctly present on film over twelve and a half percent of our population to get it right*
While Hollywood is always offering rhetoric about inclusion, its never included any degree of equality for disabled, either as actors or characters.
Kudos Chloe, youve broken down a barrier that might not have been your intent to influence, but for the 12.6%, feeling its long long long overdue. As near fatal post traumatic injury survivor myself, I'm proud to see in this film,this subject managed either gently or with brute machismo. I'm delighted to know that subject matter which dominated news stories in recent years TBI is no longer being treated as toxic to the arts.*
To grasp as subject matter the first year post trauma, the emotional overlay as each survivor begins to understand their life will not be taking the same path of their prior choosing, the assimilation of these changes followed by the progression of new tangental pathways will always lead to a treasure trove of stories, redemptions, conquerings and successes which no-one in filmmaking had yet touched. In 2018, as american cinematography follows cultural and societal changes, we are seeing more films include LBGT romances; more films than thirty years prior; with interracial partnerships; indigenous cultural themes, yet not until The Rider had we seen a taste of that deep ocean of drama surrounding sudden physical challenges, contrapuntal emotional struggles, social support. To date, disabled civilian populations which fall in numbers between those of African-American and Hispanic populations hasnt been an opened parcel of stories to performing arts or films. 
Scars show us where we have been, they do not dictate where we are going.
A sequel revealing the next chapter in young Bradys recently altered life path would be welcome. There remains decades beyond. 
Horse persons, Indigenous persons, rodeo, central plains states, twenty something young adults persons with disability challenges may all be drawn to this film, albeit I venture to guess a broader audience still will leave this film appreciating quality and talents viewed across many aspects of the poetically endearing story.* 12.6% of America live with a life altering disability. 1.7Million incidence of TBI annually in USA 22% fatal. Civilian disabled children and adults remain the most underserved, under represented sector of American population in twenty-first century. Disability pride will build through representations as ""The Rider"".",The Rider

77,disup,A decent drama to rest from blockbusters,7,2 September 2018,"The Rider is on one hand beautiful, the cinematography, the scenery and setting is quite dazzling to look at. It does capture the country´s charm and passion. And its an Indie movie so its slow paced, edited on a less conventional way and has non-actors who at the very least look different from the high stars.On the other its a decent drama about a coming of age kid in a rural environment with a very linear ideal of manhood. It's also a journey to his identity and how to deal with it now with an disability. The movie captures greatly the sense of loss for every part of his lifestyle he adores. This is until he takes the decision between following his dream bieng a ""man"" or being a ""man"", in the sense that sometimes its not about proving how much of a man you to others but rather, you need to get on yourself and move on, some people might need you now.
Hence the strongests points are his relationships with his friend and sister, which I notice they are meant to be portrait as stronger than with the horses, as to showcase how more important they are than his dream to continue on the rodeo.That's what I get from it.My personal issue however, and it's kind of its charm ironically, are the performances. Like I said, these are almost non-actors and most of them, specially the main actor do a decent job. But there are others like the father and some the extras who are a bit underwhelming, It does get kind of distracting.Still is a good film and if you want something fresh and rest a little from the hollywood blockbusters this a nice option.",The Rider

Taking place in the smallest of settings while being unveiled as the slowest of paces, a heartfelt story is told with the upmost care. While the core plot of The Rider is an old one, the precision with which this film is crafted elevates the experience to a level of relatability and immersion that few motion pictures achieve. From top-notch casting to seamless editing, this is a movie done right.The direction, sound and acting of The Rider will garner praise for their elite qualities but it is the cinematography of this film that is the real gem. Whether it's the extended takes of genuine, emotional interactions between living creatures or the deeply cinematic sequences of horse-riding through the sunset, the camerawork of The Rider is undeniable.

He tries to find new meaning of what life has in store for him. During the run of the film I couldn't help but to be reminded of other movies similar to the one I front of me. (The Wrestler was a big one) the trials of both Physical and mental the main character is faced with. The over whelming feeling of sympathy along with the underlying tale of battling with depression. All of which are familiar. What sticks this film out in both good and bad ways is the casting of non trained actors (it's all jandreau family members and friends playing themselves as far as I know ) a bit distracting at some point but also so real at others making powerful enough to feel the weight the main character is going through such as the case of Brady paraplegic friend. As for the film making aspect, I highly appreciated the use of natural lighting throughout the project. The use of the the sun in the background in some shots were very pleasing to the eye. 
The shots on site locations where amazing. One Particular scene comes to mind were there is a lightning storm in the background. And the bronco riding scenes were just captured in such a raw way. They demand your attention. Unfortunately, a big down fall by far goes to the audio. Some of the dialect you could barely hear compare to the booming audio dubbed of the sister lily.

101,daryuschandra,The Story of the Real-life Rodeo and How to Let Go,9,30 December 2019,"This time the opportunity goes to The Rider (2017), a film directed by Chloé Zhao, a Chinese film director, screenwriter, and producer born in Beijing. It fascinates me when I learn that this is only the second film from Zhao and the theme of the first film, ""Songs My Brothers Taught Me"" (2015), was also similar. It also involved wilderness, horses, and how ones dealing with such tough decisions. In one of the interviews, Zhao explained that her affection to the western theme and the wilderness surrounding it was drawn from her fondness to Mongolian plains. The recent news also confirmed that Zhao will direct a film entitled ""Nomadland"" starring the Academy Award winner Frances McDormand and also a film from the Marvel Cinematic Universe, ""The Eternals"".The film tells the story of Brady Jandreau (in the film his name is changed to Brady Blackburn), a Rodeo rider who struggles to get his life back together and get back on the saddle after underwent a very horrific accident. First of all, the casts for this film are already unique since they cast the entire Jandreau family to star the film. In fact, the film itself is actually inspired by the true story of the main actor, a formula which Zhao has used for her previous work ""Songs My Brothers Taught Me"" (2015). She gave the opportunity to the actors to tell their own story.This type of treatment is not specifically new. It has been tried several times before, for example, ""The Greatest"" (1977) starring Mohammad Ali, which is basically his own biopic film. I will make a huge assumption here, so feel free to give me some perspectives later. This method can be used super effectively for channeling the raw emotions of the actors since the actors actually experienced all the scenes in the real-life setting. However, it will require a very attentive treatment from the director considering that the actors had a relatively zero experience in front of the camera. Otherwise, it will probably end up as a cinematic disaster. In this film, I will say that Zoe achieves tremendous success. During the film, you will know immediately that some of them are not professional actors. In a way, realizing that they are not properly trained actors made me had to compromise myself to the expectation of what ""good acting"" is, but on the other hand, the emotion they gave to the camera is raw, pure, and unfiltered. This type of sentiment is very rare to be witnessed in the cinemas. It's beautiful.As we go deeper into the plot, it gets clearer that it's not simply a story about a man and his rodeo world. Multiple layers of complexity start to unravel giving us a storyline that probably will resonate with a lot of the audiences. His family is poor, they live in a trailer, his younger sister has a mental disability, and one of his best friend, which was also a rodeo, also underwent a horrific accident, which resulted in a more damaging physically compared to Brady's (in real life, his best friend Lane Scott had a car accident, not a rodeo accident). During the film, we can comprehend that his conventional idea of masculinity was ultimately challenged. He felt like his pride and dignity was in peril. It is not just about the story of a rodeo who struggles to find his way back into the only world he ever knows, but also about letting it go.Probably he did not anything else besides doing rodeo. The rodeo was his whole world. I could not imagine how hard it is to let go the only thing you know since growing up and the only thing that I fond deeply. All of these entangled feelings and emotional conflicts were displayed in all rawness.I also have to praise and applaud Joshua James Richards, the cinematographer. The gorgeous shots of the slow-motion evocative close up in the very beginning of the film is a strong statement. The beautiful landscape of South Dakota nature, captivating terrain, and enchanting horse-riding scenes. They are aligned perfectly with the emotion that the films try to convey. Just a little bit of trivia, there is a 7-minute scene where it just shows you how the Brady trains a horse. It was mentioned during the interview that for this specific scene, the Zhao only wrote down ""Brady trains a horse"" for the whole 7-minute scene.In conclusion, this film is not a film that will give you a roller-coaster type of emotions, jump-from-your-seat climaxes, or well-defined resolutions. Instead, this is a story that will guide you through a journey and it makes you aching slowly.",The Rider
102,monikilbourne,Slow and it never gets better,1,20 August 2018,Rented this movie based on high reviews. This movie is slow. It drags on forever. There is no real story line and the actors are terrible.,The Rider
103,judithlongman,So incredibly touching,8,22 September 2021,Wow. I was worried this was going to be a bit cheesy but it's so raw and sad and honest. No easy answers. Loved it. A joy for horse lovers especially. I'll be thinking about this film for a long time.,The Rider
104,j_chenier,An artistic masterpiece,9,29 November 2018,"Okay, this one was a surprise. ""The Rider"", directed by Chloé Zhao, tells the story of a young man's search for a sense of purpose after a debilitating injury. The story is loosely based on the true life events of its main actor, Brady Jeandreau. The film, which features mostly real people acting as themselves, has an incredibly genuine feel to it that is rare in modern movies. In fact, the use of real people instead of seasoned actors contributes to what makes this movie really stand out. The story, which is heartfelt and multilayered, lingered in my mind long later the credits rolled. The cinematography, which greatly contributes to the overall feel of the film, is incredibly artistic in the way it translates the South Dakota countyside to the big screen. There were many moments that I was mesmerized by the beautiful panoramas flashing before me on the screen. This film, which didn't get a lot of attention at the box-office, is worth tracking down for those who enjoy a truly artistic experience where the screen is the canvas for a masterful filmmaker.",The Rider
105,benjaminlatta,Wow,9,18 October 2018,"For someone that has a TBI as a result of playing contact sports for eons this film hit home. A big part of our culture relates to being strong and tough. Unlike Lane in the story your average TBI sufferer, like Brody, looks and appears for all purposes fine. Completely fine. No scar even, no seizures. Nothing. People assume you are fine. But you aren't. Some friends will get it. Some will not. You are carrying a bomb around in your head and it's always ready to go off. To suddenly be called weak minded or soft, after a lifetime trying to prove your toughness. It's infuriating. For men especially physicality is a big part of our identity. But I can no longer do many physical things: skiiing, basketball, contact sports, fighting if I need to. Tonight at a concert there was a small mosh pit. I was terrified of someone hitting my head. I'm 35. It's emasculating. It's hard to walk away from all of this instantly. It's like ageing 40 years in a heartbeat. It is more frustrating because you can physically do these things, but you can't afford to because of the potential consequences. But unlike Lane, who can't physically ride a horse, Brody has to relent as he can do it, but it could harm him. It's a mind warp to be able to do something you love, ut know that you shouldn't. It takes some getting used to. I'm amazed the filmmakers were able to capture this so succinctly. Not to be rude, but particularly a female Dirextor. I was proud of the fact that Brody walked away rather than going out on his shield. It wasn't what he wanted, or what was ideal. But he played the hands he was dealt. I hope the real Brody finds meaning post-injury. I can't say how shocked I am at how well this film captured the experience of TBI, especially for young men. Astounding.",The Rider
106,gregwhite-18238,Stunning,10,27 August 2018,"My first review. I'm still thinking about this movie a week later due to the story and stunning cinematography. As real and raw a movie as you will see. Slow to build, the actors are revealed as real people with real stories. Watching slightly dour cowboys come to life breaking horses was memorable, as was the bond between those who can no longer ride.",The Rider
107,whitehallnorfolk,Much mumbling,3,19 September 2018,Filled with lots of mumbling Americans-got the drift of the film but prefer a little more action with people who speak clearly. I'm sure it was great if you knew what they were talking about!!,The Rider

109,menesewillow,The Rider rides with an even stable pace,8,28 April 2019,"Through brilliant performance and meticulous script that uses enough props to express views and intentions, the message is sound and clear. Another beautiful aspect of the feature is the interaction of our protagonist with horses, the way he tames and communicates with them, it doesn't require any verbal sparring to mesmerize you. And fabricating this drama into a compelling action, is Jandreau, delivering a stellar performance to observe at.",The Rider

112,vincent-23111,This movie does not know how to tell a story,1,19 October 2018,"I am not one to give low ratings lightly, and yet I can say without hyperbole, that this is the worst film I have ever seen. There is no rising tension. It's just monotone, mindnumbing white noise. It's sorta like a documentary or a biography I guess, so maybe that's why? I just don't see how anyone could possibly get anything out of this film.",The Rider
113,rcktori,Amazing movie with a lot of depth!,10,8 March 2019,"I heard that this was a good movie, but I didn't know that much about it before watching it. I'm glad I did check it out though, as this film is probably one of the deeper movies to come out in quite some time. The acting is excellent (especially for a cast full of ""non-actors) and very heartfelt. I hope that someone is smart enough to place the lead actor Brady Jandreau, in something else as he did a fantastic job in his first film. This movie is a slow burner, but if you like a good story and acting that comes from the heart, then you will like this movie. Please share this with friends and family members who love great cinema!",The Rider

117,danjou-04004,"Stunning, Innovative, Groundbreaking, Boring",7,23 July 2018,"I went to see this movie on a whim because it was the only thing playing near me that seemed even somewhat interesting (aka an independent drama with a nice poster), and I noticed one afternoon that the final showing would be later that night. I had read very briefly about the premise of the movie but had forgotten all about it by the time I actually went to go see it. I nearly walked out of the theater after half an hour, the only inhibiting factor being that I'd already splurged on a full-price evening ticket, a large popcorn, and two bottles of water to match. The cinematography was very nice and some shots were genuinely stunning, but the pacing was abysmal. It wasn't until I started wondering how on earth they'd managed the horse training scene some ~40-50 minutes in that the premise slowly came back to me. Isn't this the movie where the actors are actual cowboys or something? If that's the case, we're doing pretty well. Maybe I'll stick it out, even after I finish my popcorn.And I don't know. It does get more interesting as it goes along and I was genuinely engaged during the hospital visit scenes. There's a decent enough thematic depth to it. But the script is just very weak here. I'd give it a 5/10 if not for the cinematography and the surprisingly good performances from the non-actors in the movie. Some of the dialogue really stuck out as overbearing or clumsy. In short, the gimmick is the meat here. That's not a good sign.",The Rider

It started slower than I anticipated, but as the movie continued, I realized I had witnessed something special. It was truly an amazing story, with great acting.
