0,nogodnomasters,I Kissed a Girl,6,5 July 2017,"The film is a lesbian drama that centers on Dallas (Erika Linder) a Swedish roofer working in San Francisco (or some other North American city with a trolley car). She is built like a model, but acts rough. We see her initially being disagreeable and breaking up with Joshlyn (Mayko Nguyen) and shortly thereafter hooking up with Jasmine (Natalie Krill) a woman who is engaged to a hunk who is financially sound. Dallas is a wreaking ball when it comes to relationships and she know it. She works for ""Above your head specialists"" which is a sort of pun on the title or the title is a pun of her company's by-line.As an old white guy, the moody appeal of Dallas didn't make it for me as much as her casualness about her nudity. I can see where certain women might be able to relate to the film and identify with it. I found it boring and going no where.Guide: F-word, sex, nudity (Natalie Krill, Erika Linder, Mayko Nguyen + strippers)",Below Her Mouth
1,Platypuschow,Below Her Mouth: Still don't know why it's called that,4,28 August 2017,"This piece of LGBT cinema was flawed from the outset for a number of reasons and that is a damn shame.Telling the story of an engaged girl who finds herself in a sexual relationship with a girl and the effect it has on her life.Here is the main issue, a movie is doomed to failure if you don't like the protagonist(s). And how am I supposed to like or care about this girl when the entire movie is about her cheating on her partner? She may very well be having a sexual ""Awakening"" but that doesn't take anything away from her actions. The movie doesn't even present the fiancé as a bad guy either which they often do to soften the blow.Highly explicit very graphic (And certain sexual acts are clearly real) this highly charged tale of seduction, sexuality and betrayal is a simple one but quite powerful regardless.I being the loyal pup I am simply cannot get over that one major plot flaw though and that's why to me this piece of cinema fails and fails hard despite being a well made film.The Good:Very well shotThe Bad:Just can't get behind an unfaithful protagonist",Below Her Mouth
2,AngelHonesty,Poorly Done,2,29 December 2019,"Almost everything about this movie was poorly done.

They are so woody that sometimes the chairs in the scene out acts them. The butch lead Swede gives a good Kirsten Stewart impression and the posh girl she meets up with come right out a Z list Danielle Steel adaptation. Its complete dogshit.

5,GomezAddams666,A complete disaster,1,9 August 2018,"This is probably one of the most unrealistic romantic films I have ever seen and hat says a lot.We are supposed to believe that a person who has been seeing their partner for years falls madly in love with someone over a weekend.I know romantic films do not have to have realism in it but they have to at least have some sort of feeling to suspend disbelief and this movie does not.This is a raunchier version of Room in Rome but without the great performances, dialogue and photography that define that movie.",Below Her Mouth
6,jhr2012,Much better than expected.,8,29 April 2018,"I decided to give this one a try, as the subject matter is not one I see often, and I wasn't disappointed. 
This was a lot more explicit than I expected which was a pleasant surprise. Natalie Krill certainly had my full attention throughout. She was amazing! It may not be an accurate portrayal of that lifestyle, but I that's not why I watched.
I felt sorry for the fiance; he was totally blindsided. But then again, he over reacted once he found out.
All in all, a very entertaining movie.",Below Her Mouth

8,Moviegoer19,Raised Questions,6,13 August 2017,"As a straight woman I've wondered what the appeal is in a woman who acts like a man? The answer would seem to be that hopefully the more positive qualities that women often have, e.g., sensitivity, awareness of another's feelings, willingness to talk and discuss, would still be there despite the more masculine appearance and personality. In this film, I questioned what was it that attracted Jasmine to Dallas and the answer kept being that Dallas treated her like a princess. Jasmine appeared to ""love"" Dallas because of Dallas's seeming worship of her. That, and perhaps the greater knowledge of how to treat a woman sexually that lesbians tend to have. So ultimately this was a film about two self-centered characters getting off on each other's ability to feed their respective egos. Another question was again in Dallas's character, she was all about sexually pleasing whatever woman she was with, yet they didn't do the same for her. So naturally, she seemed doomed to wind up feeling unhappy, deprived and somewhat like a martyr. We did see her going down on Jasmine but not the reverse, which also implied the question of whether Jasmine was even into Dallas's body? Ultimately, I have to agree with the other reviewers who said this film was short on plot and big on soft-core eroticism. A couple of questions were raised but there's not enough depth for them to be answered.",Below Her Mouth
9,aliases-53334,I quite liked it,8,16 September 2019,I thought the intimate scenes were very realistic and the chemistry was undeniable. Story was good too. The acting was difficult to take but it is compensated with everything else.,Below Her Mouth
10,annuskavdpol,A Canadian movie!,6,14 February 2017,"This movie is very graphic. It is about a very passionate and honest lesbian who breaks up with her long-term relationship because she believes she is toxic to her because she does not love her the way the other loves her. In a way this is both cruel and honest. It is not very accommodating to the feelings of the girlfriend, who shows signs of disgust, hurt and utter alienation. This break-up scene which sets the stage for the whole movie is significant. Lesbian movies often do not make the big screen theaters, so this one slipped through the cracks, in my opinion. In a way, Dallas, the lead female actress, is a very cold and calculated person. How could you be living with someone and treat them so callously in the end of the long-term relationship? In a way, Dallas is like a sexual predator. Within, what seems like minutes and seconds, she goes to nightclubs to scope out her next victim in the lesbian bars and nightclubs. She has no remorse, empathy nor compassion for the feelings of her ex. Instead she jumps on the saddle, makes a move with the bar-tender (who her best-friend indicated that she really liked herself for a couple of months already) and then kisses and makes out with the neighbor of her Roofing construction work site. It is the contention, that Dallas finds love in the end. But the story development surrounding the theme of love in relationships is not fully explored through the cinematic camera shots. Broken Back Mountain, a movie about two men who create a bond with each other, is a far more in depth character study of two individuals who really care a lot about each other. To me, Broke Back Mountain is a way better portrayal of the theme of universal love. This is a Canadian movie versus a Hollywood movie. And the genre of other love is still new to the silver screen. This is a good attempt into this genre. It is similar in style to the Canadian movie, Exotica.",Below Her Mouth
11,nitro72,Not Much To Praise,1,16 March 2019,"Not much to praise in this pointless drama featuring two reprehensible people: one who cheats on her fiancé, the other who treats women like dirt; the direction, script, music, & performances are all dull, lifeless, & tedious.",Below Her Mouth
12,pik923,Horrible,1,14 August 2017,"Bad enough men exploit women in films this is women exploiting women in a soft porn horrible film with no redeeming features except most of the actors are lovely to look at. Really girls give it a break huffing and puffing and all this stuff with a stupid storyline terrible script worse acting, drinking drinking more drinking, and a lot of heavy breathing and stupid penetrating sex. I'm just really amazed at how bad this was and I'm sure men will get off on it as well as some women but time to make decent films about women loving women. Get some education read some classics make it interesting, dazzle us with good solid filmmaking. This film is an insult and so predictable - booorrrinnnngggg",Below Her Mouth
13,shannen-l-c,Doesn't deserve all the bad reviews,5,24 June 2018,"Below Her Mouth isn't the best movie ever written, it's not original or well-thought out, but it has a lot of good points. Firstly, though neither of the main actresses Natalie Krill (Jasmine) and Erika Linder (Dallas) are amazingly talented, their chemistry is fantastic. Although the relationship between the characters develops at an incredibly fast pace, the electric chemistry between Natalie and Erika sells it and makes it believable. The sex scenes were a lot more explicit than I expected (I didn't watch the trailer or know anything about the movie before watching, so went in blind and was a little surprised) but incredibly erotic and sensual. For those reviewers saying the sex scenes were awkward or boring, they must have been watching something different to me. I could feel the attraction and connection between the two characters through the sex scenes. It definitely wasn't porn in the traditional sense because none of it felt mechanical, it was as though I was genuinely watching two people having raw, intimate and vulnerable sex. The movie is guilty of playing into some over-used stereotypes by writing Dallas as the butch, mean and dominant lesbian and Jasmine the meek, confused femme lesbian that cheats on her fiance. Generally, there also wasn't much development for the characters or as much insight into them as people as there could've been. However, I do think the romance between the two women made sense. You could feel the loneliness of Dallas and Jasmine at the beginning and that there was something missing in their lives. They had a magnetic pull and in each other found that spark that had been missing. Dallas found someone she wanted to open up to and be vulnerable with and Dallas allowed Jasmine to finally feel all the emotions she'd been suppressing since she was a child and release all that pent up tension and unhappiness that came from denying her sexuality for so long. Admittedly, there wasn't much plot and the sex and romance is really all there is, but if people dig a little deeper with this move there are actually some very important messages contained within it. It shows how difficult it can be to be who we truly are and be honest with ourselves about what/who we want, and that sometimes it's not always easy to label ourselves one way or another. Dallas said she knew she was attracted to women from a young age, it was a simple choice for her, but Jasmine didn't have that same clarity. In that respect, it shows some of the struggles people can come up against in discovering who they are or the inner turmoil people can go through when they're confused about their sexuality. Overall, Below Her Mouth isn't a great movie, but it's not terrible either. It would have benefited from more character development and plot and perhaps a little less sex, but was still a reasonably engaging movie.",Below Her Mouth
14,sagetwo,Sex...and more sex,3,21 July 2020,"I gave the movie, 3/10 because of the good chemistry between the two female lead characters. Sure, there were a few intense and emotional scenes. However, it was mostly sex. At first, the sexual scenes were beautiful. Then, they overtake the whole movie. I wanted to see their love grow emotionally as well.Side notes: a) Dallas, the girl with the short hair is a creep. She cannot take no for an answer, and chase after the other girl. If she was a boy, we would call her out. b) It is still cheating even with the same sex. c)Bisexuality exists.",Below Her Mouth

16,a666333,"soft porn clichés, rename to ""Below her Navel""",2,20 June 2017,"Don't have any doubts, this is an amateur(ish) soft porn film that is vainly trying to sell itself as something meaningful. Unfortunately, it doesn't even succeed well as soft core porn as it amounts to one tired cliché after another and is not even sexy. The clichés are in every scene setup, every character and every line of dialogue. You know the ultimate role and fate of every character within seconds of their introduction. There is not even the smallest surprise or suspense in anything. And certainly you have seen everything here before and done much better. The production team took the straightest and easiest road at each turn. If it was sold as a demo film designed to show that the production team could actually carry the thing through to the end, then maybe they succeeded but they are selling this as some kind of significant film. In that, they simply insult the audience and engage in fraud. And don't look for a rescue in the WOODEN acting, the camera work, the lighting or the directing. You will search in vain. You might find entertainment value is seeing just how predictable it is or how many clichés they march out.",Below Her Mouth
17,Sumpmonster,Porn Masquerading as Art,3,11 October 2018,"Very cliched movie with little character development and the basic, thoughtless plot that is churned out daily in soap operas. This has the added titillation of young nubile actress strutting their naked bodies and partaking in badly simulated sex acts. It's so predictable and dull that every time another sex scene comes along you just want them to get it over and done with. The only redeeming points are some decent performances, particularly from Natalie Krill.",Below Her Mouth

19,shevaunhodge,Good sex scenes,10,7 February 2019,"Ok so reading the reviews I started to question myself, but I Actually really liked this film. Yes,as stated below the main character Dallas is probably ""Shane"" from the L word and to be honest I didn't get why she would be able to get all these straight hot women like jasmine to sleep with her. I did find it weird that she wore a strap on a lot. I have never met Lesbian that does this. The script isn't the best, but I thought the sex scenes were really hot and the story line did intrigue me, but I'm easily pleased some would say . Maybe I don't know enough about films to write a ""proper review""but I liked it.",Below Her Mouth
20,arthousefilms-68-939717,"Fantastic Acting, Amazing directing, Insanely steamy",9,15 October 2017,"— The acting in this film was super solid, as was the directing. The story, a pretty standard infidelity theme, was unoriginal but superbly executed.— My favorite thing about this movie was the romantic development at the start of the relationship of the two leads. It was really satisfying to feel the hunt and chase in action. It was all super plausible and believable. —- The Toronto setting was beautifully shot. The cinematography was perfect.About the sex scenes:—- Honestly, this movie draws a very blurry line between porn and art. It may be one of the most sexually explicit films I have ever seen. In fact, it is so explicit, that sometimes it took me out of film by wondering things like:—— Are they really doing it on the set in front of a whole crew? —- Are they really aroused on set? I mean there is full contact with all the erogenous zones —- Was it uncomfortable for the crew to watch?—— etc.The point is, as beautiful and steamy the sex scenes were, they ended up being a distraction to the emotional connection of the film. I mean, there was full on nudity with full-on lesbian sexual action. Everything from masturbation to sex toys was covered in explicit and stunningly beautiful cinematography. Also, I happened to have streamed this film alone, but the experience made me think I would have been far too embarrassed to watch it with anyone else such as a friend, wife, relative, girlfriend, boyfriend. I can't imagine watching this film with another human without strong reactions about comparing one's self or sexual activity to that which was depicted on screen.Still, I loved this film. It felt very sincere. As a giant fan of indie romance films, this film was firing on all cylinders!",Below Her Mouth

22,valinvancouver,This movie grew on me,8,4 August 2017,"I initially rated this movie 6.5 but have found in the two days since I can't stop thinking about it so have come back to rewrite my review and up my rating.Some reviewers have trashed the acting but I think Erika does a fine job as the butch ""lady-killer"" and Natalie is fantastic in the role of the femme, Jasmine. The problem for me was that until they start having sex both the main characters are pretty unlikable, to the point I almost stopped watching. Dallas is a self-serving asshole, and Jasmine appears to be stuck-up and has no qualms about lying at work to get what she wants. However, once they start having sex they drop their respective facades and have a sweet little affair, with a fair amount of hot, explicit sex. Yes, the plot is thin but that's typical of lesbian fiction.In my earlier review I kind of trashed the writing. I thought they fell short in explaining why Dallas was such an asshole. But again, this isn't based on great literature, and once I got past that annoyance I started to consider other things that weren't explicitly stated but still came through in various scenes. Like the fact that, while Jasmine and Rile have a decent relationship, it's still a lonely existence for Jasmine as he can't quite connect to her playful nature. And in scenes of Dallas when she's alone she's obviously unhappy. And it's truly heartbreaking to watch Jasmine try and return to her straight life. I think Natalie Krill's performance nails it.So yes, I liked the movie. It's not a light and fluffy, feel good movie like ""Imagine Me & You."" Instead, its a simple story told fairly well.",Below Her Mouth
23,lucymull,Underrated,7,10 January 2020,"I really enjoyed this film and would definitely recommend it.
In places it did seem a bit derivative, as does any romance film, but that didn't spoil my viewing. Despite what I've read in many of the other reviews, I personally liked the acting and dialogue. I think the chemistry between Dallas and Jasmine was clear from the start. The love between them actually made me cry at times. It was really refreshing to see sexuality portrayed on screen as something that is not black and white, and to see an androgynous main character.
My only complaints are the beginning and the end. I think the affair escalated too quickly, with Jasmine's guilt seemingly disappearing in an instant, never to be mentioned again until she was caught in the act. And I think the ending jumped too quickly to happy ever after with no transitional period shown on screen. However, I can excuse the rushed start to the film as being due to time constraints or as a sign of the passion between the two main characters, and it was nice to see things end well for Jasmine and Dallas.
I would definitely watch this film again.",Below Her Mouth

25,thedisco,A real pile of garbage,1,24 August 2017,"I originally gave this movie 3 stars but after further consideration downgraded to a 1. This film is so bad it deserves a review. The film centers around a total douche bag lesbian (Dallas) who, without any charm, character, or color, manages to seduce a snobby shallow strait girl (Jasmin) who is engaged to a man (Who we never really get a chance to know because he has only a handful of lines in the film).The acting is terrible, the direction sucks, the script is horribly written, the editing was done by a monkey, and the settings are poorly made.None of the characters are developed in any way so you don't really understand why the two leads fall for each other.

28,herostratus-690-719695,"Psychodiagnostic display, not mere ""wank-rag""...",3,5 September 2017,"Since many viewers seem to ask or wonder about the meaning of this movie: This movie depicts first and foremost from my point of view that lesbian ""love"" is primarily motivated by sexual impulses or instincts, and thus primarily lust-oriented. Which somehow matches old psychiatric diagnosis of homosexuality as sexual identity disorder (which is no further allowed to talk about openly, since our totalitarian Zeitgeist prohibits such ideas today). For this rather psycho-diagnostic display I give 1 star. Of course there are some quite direct jerk-off-scenes which can be used that way, if one likes. For the explicit lesbian-sex-scenes I give a second star, because they are partially made quite nicely. For some beautiful chicks in the movie I give a third star. Although the movie does not have much more meaning than the above stated, one might find in it also some sort of ""a woman on her way to finding her true distorted self"" - but who cares? Movies like this are legion nowadays. Personally I think that this makes part of some sort of propaganda-project to brainwash people into thinking, homosexuality is normal behavior or drive, and not a psychological problem.

I liked the way that Dallas pursued Jasmine and jasmine was initially cold. I believed her reactions to the strong advances. I found them realistic. The sex scenes I also thought seemed realistic. It did feel very intimate and genuine...even the way they looked at each other. There was some clumsiness to some of the scenes but that made them seem spontaneous and real to me. Like when Jasmine playfully punched Dallas, it was slightly cringey for me, as was the moment when jasmine ""predictably' asked for Dallas' coming out story. I wanted to know it even though it's likely considered cliche these days. I did feel some mild discomfort over the infidelity issue but they were both beautiful, clever people and the gorgeous hubby would defo have no problem finding a new partner!

Taking into account this was her first film, I can give her break in that regard especially since she performed so well in the lovemaking scenes(Not much talking there,I suppose). But the true show -stealer was Natalie Krill. She was very convincing in her portrayal of a woman fighting her feelings and desires for another woman while engaged to a man but losing the battle bit by bit. A very beautiful and versatile actress is Natalie and one that I will look forward to seeing more of. The movie itself could've been better I believe had there been more effort given in portraying Dallas as a protagonist. Part of me wanted to see her fall in love and find happiness while another part didn't think she truly deserved it because of her insensitivity.Very much like Shane McCutcheon as the previous reviewer stated.",Below Her Mouth

The characters arenr complexly explored but it is a nice movie that shows a love at first sight kind of thing, i feel sometimes its nice to see movies where everythinf isnt complex or explained in every detail, gives you a chance to wonder and take it for what it is.

The nude scenes of lovemaking are amazingly well done, moving, and strikingly realistic. They capture the kind of ""madly, badly"" in love passion that those fortunate enough to have experience in life will appreciate. Likewise, anyone seeing this as a ""Lesbian"" film, also misses the point, though that is an important part of the story line--with Natalie Krill's character coming out and cautiously and painfully discovering her sexuality. But more than sex, or lesbianism, or any other social commentary this is a film about how two people can fall madly and suddenly in love for reasons the heart and body only know.

In fact there are some parts that are gut-renchingly awful and crinchworthy. And if you have a bad script then it's gonna be tough for the actresses to pull it out the bag and fair play to them they gave it a good go ;-) I think Natalie Krill was perfectly cast in this. She is very talented but some of the lines the poor girl has to reel off really make me shudder. Same with Erica Linder; for her first feature not half bad. She has a good understanding of delivering comedy and being intense but the rest I'm sure will come given time and experience.What drives the movie is the chemistry between the two leads, it's authentic and again this is down to great casting. The director and casting director really did well here.Great direction, cinematography, fantastic score and soundtrack which showcases some of the finest Canadian musicians including Adaline.So it's a case of watch the film but ignore the terrible script.If you make a sequel get a different script writer (me, I nominate myself!!!!).",Below Her Mouth

With a lack of sense of direction at all. Was this just made for straight men? I felt that acting was stiff, the story was so contrived on so many levels. Poorly acted. Incredibly immature. I've never in ten years given a film less than five on IMDb. It's just so bad. How can anyone like a film like this anyway? I've got to say that Dallas's character is everything I dislike about the lesbian scene. She's all about ego, self-satisfaction, emotionally bankrupted, with no hint of emotional intelligence. The only reason decided to watch the entire film was the hope of seeing Dallas's character evolve. It really didn't happen. I so wished it had. Even a little. It would have been the one redeeming thing about the whole storyline. It wasn't sexy, it was cheap and sleazy. It was just sex. Again. Who was this made for? Single teenage boys maybe?

I wanted to like Erika Linder because she's beautiful and she has perfect eyes, but no one in this movie could act to save their lives. The dialogue was pitiful. I think I have watched D list horror flicks with better dialogue.The movie was marketed as being sexy. That would have worked if it were sexy. I can understand directing the women to not moan like porn stars, but neither of them looked like they were enjoying it. It was absolutely uncomfortable to watch two women hump each other disinterestedly.I thought that this was trying to be the Canadian Blue is the Warmest Colour, but instead it was a soft core porn flick set in Toronto. Although, to be honest, I've watched porn with a thicker plot than this movie had. Also, apparently the only way lesbians get off is with dildos and rubbing their vaginas against each other. TIL.Main character's (MC) boyfriend goes away for the weekend (or a week? I don't even know). MC meets lesbian with a hot name, doesn't discourage any of her advances, hooks up with her a day later, they have sex the whole time. And then the most predictable thing happens - the boyfriend comes home early and catches them. Who saw that coming? Everyone. Just insulting to the viewers' intelligence. Boyfriend and MC try to have sex, can't, and then a black screen later and MC and hot lesbian are together again.The best shot of the movie was literally the lighting of a cigarette 15 minutes in. It felt like Film School 101. There were no real inspired shots of the city, which was extremely disappointing.",Below Her Mouth

The dream of how the relationship evolves is old. Ugh, the dialogue is terrible. Too many typical cliches coming from a straight gal that has no experience. Soundtrack is stopped abruptly during scenes changes. Scenes too short and do not form any credible lesbian ideologies within genre. This is simply soft porn to fill a void in the day, allowing folks to get off. Oh well. Just another ""LookAtMe"" vehicle with nothing to say. Really? A wince from butch as she starts to penetrate with the strap-on? Done with this...39 minutes in. I don't understand what Mullen is trying to put across.",Below Her Mouth
42,brentnacu,Movie Fan Real Review,7,1 October 2018,"First off, this is a sexy, sensual-based bi-sexual drama. If you don't like solid Indie films, don't get carried away over thinking this. It's like hating John Wick and writing a review. Early PS: this is so much sexier than any 50 Shades version... watch it twice with wine! I won't spoil this, but was surprised and pleased with plot and subsequent sexual intensity that took place. 1) the actors seemed natural
2) the sex and intimacy were even better 
3) much bigger Hollywood films have tried this hard and not achieved the results. Congrats to the hard work and trusf by the actors to create this level of sexuality and viewer attraction without being difficult.Although it's Canadian and lower budget, I need to be real. But still very well.done for eroctic.",Below Her Mouth

44,offmymeds,Exceptional,4,14 September 2017,"Perhaps, second only to Blue is the Warmest Color, this graphic depiction of same-sex love and eroticism, is the most realistic portrayal that I have viewed of this subject. It is always kind and sympathetic to its protagonists. For those who would eschew this reality, exercise caution: this is not a film for you. For those who can accept love and erotica in all of its diversity, clarity and detail, I could not more highly recommend it.",Below Her Mouth

46,mozeg0d,"Nice and dirty, but at what cost?",4,17 January 2019,"This film is pretty self explanatory. It's about a presumed straight girl getting seduced by an attractive blonde lesbian. The brunette is engaged to a man, but it is soon revealed that she's actually been with a female before in her younger years. This particular movie is a good example of an erotic film with little to no backstory. It could have taken the time to develop that rather important key of character growth (her being with a girl before the blonde) but instead decided to throw that piece of detail in without a second thought, thus making it seem as though her ending up with her fiancee was something that just happened out of the blue.Usually, a movie's job is to capture the viewer and manipulate them to feel a certain way towards the characters. But it fails to show any true character development or strong story-line that makes the viewer, or at least myself, think, ""Huh, didn't see that coming."" Frankly, it was overall very predictable.Now let's take away the important aspects that this movie lacks and focus on what it leans heavily on: lesbian sex. If you were looking for a quick, sexy movie to watch with little plot and hardly any conflict other than the brunette cheating on her husband, I'd suggest this movie for you. This movie is like reading a smutty fanfic from Wattpad. You don't necessarily go for the storyline, although for most, a small storyline is needed to really get into the dirtiness of what's to come later on. Instead, you go to that Wattpad story to ultimately get to the smut, which is basically what this movie is. Overall, it is there for you to watch two women engage in heated sex. It just so happens that the dispute, the very little it has, is in the shadows waiting to ruin what you've seen by reminding you that yes, the brunette is married and no, she will not end up with her secret lover in the end.",Below Her Mouth
47,KakanH,Laughable,1,21 March 2020,"If you want to have a good laugh then this is the movie for you, but I don't believe that it was the creators' intention. The acting is laughable and on the verge of becoming completely unwatchable. I have endured this movie twice and, once when it came out and one time more recently, I truly regret that decision. The relationship is moving unrealistically fast and gives no depth to the characters.

49,NeverSaneEver,"""Below Her Mouth"" sadly and terribly underrated.",9,18 November 2017,"This movie, pretty much across the board, is categorized as flat, boring, shallowly and pretentiously acted soft porn. Nothing could be farther from the truth. The two lead female roles (And supporting roles) in this movie really seem to be being themselves in their parts rather than"" scripted acting"". This lends a very real but deliberately understated feel to the movie. Contrary to what many reviews concluded, this isn't just some sort of unrealistic lesbian fantasy involving graphic sex scenes. I did find the sex scenes to be relatively unrestrained but I also found them to be very true to life, deeply touching and realistic -dealistic and honest regarding intimacy and true feelings rather than prurient. I believe what facilitated this to be true is that all the sex scenes were real. I feel the director and all the actors should get the many accolades they deserve for such a subtly but very profoundly written, acted and directed story that left me feeling a mixture of sad, mesmerized, absorbed, convinced and in the end, very uplifted. If you like watching ""acted"" movies then go to 95% of the movies produced and directed in Hollywood today. If you like unknowns depicting life the way it really unfolds in relationships then this is the movie to see no matter what you think about the graphic sex scenes which are really full of true and honest emotion. If you see it as merely glorified pornography with a hollow plot line to fill the space then you couldn't be more wrong.",Below Her Mouth
50,jindaleemt,"Erika Linder is beautiful, that's all that matters.",10,24 February 2018,"I actually enjoyed the movie. OK, I admit I am really into androgynous women like Katherine Moennig and Erika Linder. If you have the ability to appreciate the beauty of women like Erika Linder, you will be pleased by just watching her. Her acting was good in my opinion. She portrayed a person who is in love very well. Erika Linder is soooo cool and beautiful and sexy, her sheer existance is like art and poetry. I feel so lucky to have seen such a beautiful person make love. It was very stimulating in many ways. I hope to see her again in future movies.",Below Her Mouth
51,wingram-98658,"Very explicit, however not unnecessarily...",8,11 August 2019,"I have read a lot of the reviews, and although I agree, somewhat, I still liked this movie very much. In my opinion, the acting was raw, but it fit the storyline perfectly. Erika was making her first movie, so she wasn't Meryl Streep, but that was what I liked so much. It felt like you were watching the real deal. Sometimes nervous, sometimes imperfect, a little awkward, not always saying the right things in the ""perfect tone"". But, the chemistry and the emotion all seemed so believable and real. Both actresses conveyed their emotions wonderfully. I was completely mesmerized by how well they were together. Yes, the sex scenes were explicit, but they were not just thrown in there to sell the movie. The scenes were realistic, emotional, and necessary to show the incredible connection they were building. No spoilers...the only complaint I have is the same as others...the ending could have been explored a little more. I would watch a sequel to find out more!I would highly recommend this movie. The bonus is you get to watch Erika Linder, who is absolutely beautiful.",Below Her Mouth

But I find this film quite exceptional for creating such a vigorous attraction between the two woman characters, and for their acting performance giving birth to two totally elaborated and different personalities, whose traces remain marked in your mind after the film ends. The strong sexual scenes in this film with their acting power (are they?) graphically diffuse the borders between sex and love, seldom seen in much bigger invested productions.",Below Her Mouth

63,kenpoet,A testament to female love & longing,7,29 April 2017,"This film should be commended for its stark and unforgiving portrayal of Female longing, passion and Love. Though the dialogue can be predictable at times and the storyline is nothing new, the actors bring a deep sensitivity to their roles. Erika Linder's Dallas, as the out lesbian, is a character of silent brooding, prone to fits of sensual passion. Natalie Krill's Jasmine, is a Well-to-do Fashion Editor who is caught up in a lesbian romance for the first time. The chemistry between these two is real and sizzling hot, with fine touches of wonder and whimsy sprinkled in that is often the byproduct of intimacy. Like any well-made Romance, you find yourself wanting the couple to find true lasting Love. Dallas needs to find a Woman that she loves unconditionally and Jasmine needs real intimacy, which Dallas unleashes in an uninhibited frenzy. Some may think that this movie is nothing more than an excuse for pushing porn for profit, as the sex scenes are raw and carnal. But at its core, this film is an honest portrayal of the highs and lows of intimacy, from the throes of delight to the dejection of heartbreak. This makes it all the more moving as a testament to the complexity of Love & longing.",Below Her Mouth

The main characters did have decent on screen chemistry, but it was not enough to deter from the boring, typical plot. It was your run of the mill ""lesbian opens up a 'straight' woman's desires"" trope. I was glad however that the film did have a happy ending, unusual from the awful train wrecks and heartbreaks lesbian characters often fare in most films. Erika Linder's performance as Dallas, a heart-breaker who only has one night stands, is just too predictable and common. I have seen it a million times.

69,mikefewds,One of the most realistic I've seen.,9,6 June 2020,"The reviews are mostly from self-acclaimed ""lesbian-movie enthusiasts"" but I doubt they're actually in the queer community. If you all are then you'll understand how raw yet realistic this movie is.Yes, Dallas was a player because she still hasn't found the one. It can easily be distinguished from her reactions upon having sex with other girls. There were zero to none satisfaction showing on her face. After she found Jasmine and lost her, she couldn't help but head back to her lifestyle and it shows from her being a regular with the sex-worker but she felt no delight and gratification at all, unlike her experiences with Jasmine. It even shows at the very beginning of the movie, the sex was very plain and she was getting tired of having that.To those complaining about Jasmine's infidelity, cheating on her husband; did you even watch the movie? She's clearly a lesbian and had a relationship with a girl when she was younger but her mother found out and was enraged. Ever since, she has to swallow the fact that she has to be with ""anyone with a penis and a job"" she didn't like it but she didn't have the guts to disobey either. Her encounter with Dallas was all she ever wanted after her 6-7 years of confining relationship with her fiancé, Riles. I said confining not because Riles is a bad partner that restricted her from anything, but it's her desire to be free regarding to her actual sexuality. She was so excited when she painted Riles' nails but was left devastated upon his reaction. She just wanted to feel a little bit of feminity in her relationship. Therefore, her feelings are something that has been secretly buried for so long that when the chance arise she can't help herself but to give in - not immediately though, her fear was still consuming her and Dallas realized that, saying ""don't torture yourself"" in which she responded to ""you're torturing me"" and that reflects her hidden desire of wanting to experience Dallas.Ending was kind of unexpected, I think it'd be more realistic if she had stayed with Riles. Life is tragic, if the same thing were to happen in real life the farewell scene would be the very last time they'd encounter each other and go on with their lives.Other than that, it's a great movie and it's definitely in my top list of LGBTQ movies. As a gynephile non-binary, I'm giving this movie a solid 9/10.",Below Her Mouth

Best lesbian movie I've seen by far. From personal experience this is exactly how androgynous lesbians meet women. Straight women or Bi-curious women are usually attracted to androgynous folk. The timeline of the movie is over one weekend, that's usually how fast these flings start and end. Movie has a cheesy (unrealistic) ending because a woman never wins in real life - sad truth is that men always win over androgynous folk in real life. Overall, this was an accurate representation of my lifestyle, which was reassuring and exciting because I've never seen people like me on the big screen have a lead role and win the girl. I'd give it 11 stars because someone like me was finally represented in entertainment in a positive light. 😊 wish more people supported this movie!!",Below Her Mouth
