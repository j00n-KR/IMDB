0,MartinHafer,"Well, I loved this stuff when I was 14....",6,3 October 2012,"When I was about 14, I read the Hitchhiker books and saw the BBC mini-series and was captivated. Now, decades later, I watch ""The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"" and wonder exactly what I saw in it. Yes, I suppose it IS vaguely entertaining and occasionally funny, but it was not nearly as wonderful as I remembered. And, I am not sure how much of this is because the movie was only okay and how much of it is because my tastes have changed. Regardless, I found THIS movie mildly diverting but nothing special. However, it was nice to finally see a film version whose special effects were up to the job--as the BBC series was amazingly bad (even for the 1981) when it came to replicating outer space--and especially Zaphod's extra head. Sorry to be a drip--I just didn't particularly enjoy this film and found it to be just a mildly interesting time-passer.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
1,TheLittleSongbird,"A great cast and great source material, what went wrong?",3,12 April 2011,"The BBC mini-series may have had a low budget, but overall it was excellent and captured the essence of the story wonderfully, which this film doesn't. The source material is so good, and deserves a much better movie and adaptation than this misfire.The only redeeming merits are some of the effects, costume and set design(apart from the villains which were too grotesque and the Vogons look silly) and the performance of Martin Freeman. Joby Talbot's music is both good and disappointing, good in the sense of how well it is composed, disappointing in how it fitted with the film's moods.My biggest beef of the film is how much the cast is wasted. This is a great cast. Helen Mirren? Alan Rickman? Bill Nighhy? Anna Chancellor? Sam Rockwell? Sterling actors, but wasted by quite a number of components, Rockwell especially is made to go over-the-top and it doesn't work at all.So what was wrong with this movie? A lot of things is the correct answer. The book is so good, but impossible to compress into a 2-hour movie. I try not to be a purist, but this adaptation is far too condensed and pivotal elements are lost of their meaning and some especially the romance are shoe-horned and feel superfluous.Other flaws are the confused storytelling, the tedious pacing, the embarrassing dialogue, characters that are devoid of any complexity and turned into walking clichés and less-than-mediocre direction.All in all, a sad mess. 3/10 Bethany Cox",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
2,SnoopyStyle,a credit to the originality of the book,8,14 September 2013,"From the oddly compelling Douglas Adams book of the same name, this is about the end of the Earth. Well at least they start with blowing up the Earth. Arthur Dent (Martin Freeman) is an everyman loser. He never gets the girl. He loves a spot of tea. He's the last to know anything. And when the Earth is blown up by aliens, he's lucky his friend Ford Prefect (Mos Def) is unbeknownst to him an alien. With nothing but a towel, they hitchhike to the rest of the universe. Zaphod Beeblebrox (Sam Rockwell) is the powerless President of the Universe. Trillian (Zooey Deschanel) is the only other human to have survived. Marvin (voice Alan Rickman) is a chronically depressed robot.To say this is unique is missing the point. And missing the point is definitely possible if you haven't read the book. There is a sarcastic sense of humor, and underlying sense of the absurd that the film is trying to transfer from the book. Sam Rockwell rocks as the manic craze idiotic President. Zooey Deschanel is cute and wonderful. Martin Freeman is the perfect everyman. They are able to inject much of the wild imaginings into the film.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
3,Hitchcoc,Just Take It Piece by Piece,7,10 January 2017,"Of course, this is one of the wittiest books ever written. It is done tongue in cheek with the kinds of absurdities that one would expect from a race of aliens that don't understand us. The election of Donald Trump would be enough to give this verisimilitude. This is not unlike Monty Python in that it is hit and miss and one should take one absurdity and move on to the next. Once again, it is being vilified by people who can't stand it when liberties are taken by script writers and movie producers. The thing is that the fundamental plot is still there. Do we really need another exact version thrown at us? I thought the special effects were great as well as the helter skelter movement of the characters. And where else would one find a depressed robot? What a joy that we have Douglas Adams and such creative minds!",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
4,claudio_carvalho,Love It or Hate It: I Hated This Awful Crap,1,26 February 2006,"When my friend Marcelo (are you really my friend?) lent me this DVD, he said that ""The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"" was a very funny movie. I saw ""IMDb User's Rating"" of 6.7 with 23,595 votes, and my wife and I decided to watch it yesterday night. She stopped watching at about 48 minutes running time, but I was reluctant and decided to see the end of the story until the beginning of the credits: what a waste of time! I found this boring movie one of, or maybe the silliest and stupidest film I have ever seen. I hated this crap, which is not funny and it certainly is the worst movie of 2005. My vote is one, since IMDb does not offer the option of a zero.Title (Brazil): ""O Guia do Mochileiro das Galáxias"" (""The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxies"")",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
5,kosmasp,Great comedy,9,20 May 2007,"I have to start with Marvin. I just love that character! He's so depres... I mean so adorable! ;o) I could watch a movie, where he plays the main role! I haven't read the novel, so I didn't know what I was going to see ... but I was more than pleasantly surprised and many who've read the book told me, that this movie is very accurate to it's source! If you like, quirky and off-beat jokes/humor, than this movie is definitely something for you. And there are even nods to the novel (i.e. something about a towel, you'll see), which I think is great! One last thing (to rephrase Marvin) -> Incredible ... it's even better than I thought it would be!",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
6,lee_eisenberg,this movie may help you survive the apocalypse,10,8 June 2005,"I admit that I've never read Douglas Adams' novel, but this movie has made me want to. The story of alien Ford Prefect (Mos Def) taking human Arthur Dent (Martin Freeman) from Earth before the planet is destroyed by an extraterrestrial society building a highway. Arthur and Ford eventually end up on a spaceship with humanoid Trillian (Zooey Deschanel) and depressed robot Marvin (voiced by Alan Rickman). The rest of the movie is pretty much bouncing from planet to planet, coming across all sorts of weird characters, namely Humma Kavula (John Malkovich). Quirky English humor always abounds.Martin Freeman, continuing his character style from ""The Office"", does a great job as Arthur, and Mos Def was a very interesting choice for Ford. Sam Rockwell is really neat as a man bent on dominating the universe. This is one movie that you'll never forget, and I mean that positively.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
7,jboothmillard,The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy,5,7 September 2005,"This is a pretty random film based on a popular TV series. The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is a book that Stephen Fry explains about quite a lot, but why don't any of the characters actually use it? Martin Freeman as Arthur Dent is just an ordinary human living on the planet Earth, when he is suddenly taken away in a space ship minutes before the Earth explodes. He is sticking with his new companions to either find the reason the planet was destroyed, and who by, and see the construction of the replacement planet (Earth 2). Also starring Bill Bailey as the voice of The Whale, Richard Griffiths as the voice of Jeltz, a stupid looking John Malkovich as Humma Kavula, Bill Nighy as Slartibartfast helping to build the new Earth, Dame Helen Mirren as the voice of Deep Thought, Trainspotting's Kelly Macdonald as Reporter, The League of Gentlemen's Steve Pemberton as Mr. Prosser/Additional Vogon Voices, The League of Gentlemen's Mark Gatiss as Additional Vogon Voices, and Warwick Davis as Marvin, with Alan Rickman voicing him. Some good people in it, but I think it is only worth seeing once in a while. Worth watching!",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
8,Tweekums,Amusing new version of the story,8,6 July 2009,"Having been a fan of the original radio series as well as the books I was a little apprehensive about watching the film knowing there were quite a few changes from the original and some of the casting decisions seemed strange. My biggest concern was having Mos Def playing Ford Prefect however he hadn't been on screen for long before I forgot my concerns. I was less keen on Zaphod and the way his second head was done but the rest of the main cast were great, I especially liked Zooey Deschanel's portrayal of Trillian and Alan Rickman's voicing of Marvin the paranoid android.People familiar with the earlier versions of the story need to put those versions out of their minds as the story deviates drastically. Arthur Dent's day does not get off to a good start when he is awakened by council workers who are their to demolish his house to build a bypass. Things then get very strange when his old friend Ford Prefect announces the he is actually from a planet near Betelgeuse and not Guildford as Arthur thought, Ford tells him this because they have to hitch a lift off Earth before it is demolished by the Vogons. Once off the Earth they are captured by the Vogons who read them some terrible poetry before throwing them into space. With an improbable stroke of luck the two of them are rescued by a passing ship crewed by Ford's friend, galactic president and fugitive Zaphod and Trillian, a girl Arthur met at a party in Islington a short time ago.This is where the story deviates from the original, when Zaphod tries to take his ship to the mythical planet of Magrathea he ends up on the home planet of Humma Kavula, played by John Malkovich, who he had beaten in the presidential elections. Kavula offers to tell them how to get to Magrathea on condition that they bring back a special gun for him and leave one of Zaphod's heads as a hostage. As they depart Trillian is captured and taken to the Vogon home world to be tried for kidnapping Zaphod. In a rare display of bravery Arthur insists that they go there and rescue her before continuing to Magrathea where they have in unexpected encounter with a whale and a bowl of petunias.While I didn't find this to be as funny as the radio series I thought it was pretty good, the differences weren't bad in fact I rather liked them as it meant I got to see characters I liked in a new adventure. Fans of the TV series might be pleased to see a cameo by the original Marvin robot... although I must confess I preferred the new design, it looked just right for Marvin. I'd certainly recommend this to sci-fi fans who like a laugh.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
9,wes-connors,The Best Laid Plans of Mice and Men Often Go Awry,2,21 August 2010,"Descended directly from apes (rather than a common ancestor), ""mild-mannered"" Martin Freeman (as Arthur Dent) and his hip-hop-posing-as-an-actor-alien-pal Mos Def (as Ford Prefect) manage to escape Earth before its destruction. A few human and human-like stragglers also leave, along with the Earth's smart fish-eating species of dolphins. The most notable castaway encountered by Mr. Freeman doubles as the film's ""love"" interest, Zooey Deschanel (as Trillian). They and Mr. Def meet up with long-haired galaxy President Sam Rockwell (as Zaphod Beeblebrox), who inadvertently ordered Earth's destruction to allow for an expressway. Many secrets of the Universe are revealed, especially how to make a really dumb movie out of a clever book.** The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (4/20/05) Garth Jennings ~ Martin Freeman, Mos Def, Sam Rockwell, Zooey Deschanel",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

11,Theo Robertson,Big Budget Culture Clash That Fails,4,30 January 2010,"I've never read the source novel or indeed any of Adams work . He is for me a one time DOCTOR WHO script contributer and script editor during one of its lesser periods . Douglas Adams is also someone who introduced Richard Dawkins to his present wife and who gets name checked in The God Delusion which is one of the very few books I recommend everyone in the human race reads . In other words I'm not a fan of his satirical SF novels but do remember enjoying the BBC version of THE HITCHHIKER'S GUIDE TO THE GALAXY which was repeated on television to tie in with the big budget big screen version in 2005Perhaps the reason for the success of the TV show is simply down to the medium in which it was broadcast . Being a satire on science fiction leads to an unintended example of post modernism televisual sci-fi comment ie BBC science fiction shows such as BLAKES 7 are hindered by their budgets no matter how well they're written so the television version of HGTTG celebrates this fact by having sets that are obvious TV studio settings and Zaphod Beeblebrox second head is patently a badly made rubber model . Am I crediting Adams with too much sophistication ? Maybe but sophistication is not in this big screen version It's one of the very few British films that has topped the American box office charts but bare in mind it only stayed there for one week and only stayed in the top ten for four weeks . Perhaps even more importantly it's dubious as to how much "" Britishness "" there is in this mid Atlantic version since we have such British icons as Mos Def and John Malkovich along with several other American cast members needed for audience identification if the movie needs to make a profit in the States There's also another problem and that is adapting a novel considered to be unfilmable to the big screen . Much of the problem can be contained by constructing the story around 6 x 30 minute episodes which can be developed in episodic form . Unfortunately doing this with a self contained two hour film is difficult and watching the on screen events you become aware how plot less and episodic the story is . It's not helped either that the big budget means spectacle overwhelms the humour whilst losing the intimacy of the television version",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
12,preppy-3,Not entirely successful but not the bomb it's made out to be,7,9 May 2007,"The adventures of Englishman Arthur Dent (Martin Freeman), his friend Ford Prefect (Mos Def), the president of the universe Zaphod Beeblebox (Sam Rockwell) and Trillian (Zooey Deschanel). Oh yes and the manic depressive robot Marvin (Warwick Davis).The book by Douglas Adams was impossible to do in a 2 hour movie--but that didn't stop Hollywood! There was already a BBC miniseries back in the late 1970s-early 1980s which was great (except for the sub par special effects). This was done on a huge budget with impressive effects and a script that was (more or less) faithful to the book. The movie moves like lightning (like the book) only stopping to give a little plot explanation here and there. It should work--but it really doesn't.For one thing they made changes from the book--It throws in an almost embarrassing love connection between Trillian and Dent (it wasn't in the book). Beeblebrox had two heads in the book--here has one head on top of the other! It looks stupid and doesn't work. Prefect was white in the book--he's black here. I'm not racist but why???? There was no reason for that alteration. I know that change really annoyed fans of the book. Also the Vogons look pretty silly. And the ending of the book was changed--and badly. There was a clumsy set-up for the sequel at the end (which will never happen).The cast is actually good. Freeman and Deschanel play it straight-faced and Mos Def is pretty good if all wrong for the role. Rochwell is WAY over the top as Beeblebrox. At first I was just stunned (his personality comes out at you full force) and annoyed--but then I realized there was no other way the character could have been played. Davis is a scream as Marvin who is perfectly realized in this movie.So--all in all--this is probably the best version Hollywood will ever do with the book. It came out and almost immediately bombed. Fans were outraged at the two big changes and non-fans couldn't make heads or tails out of it. So I can see why it bombed but it's not that bad. I give it a 7. There's a nice little tribute at the very end to Douglas Adams (author of the book).",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
13,Boba_Fett1138,By no means a great movie but it's fun all.,7,31 January 2010,"In essence this movie is quite a bad one, since it does a lot of things wrong but at least it knows how to be fun, which makes this still a perfectly watchable silly movie.Silly is perhaps the right word for this movie, in the positive sense of the word. It's a quirky movie, that you can obviously absolutely never take seriously, like it was also intended not to. It has some quirky humor and characters and the movie constantly deliberately goes over-the-top with it all, which gives the movie a special and fun kind of atmosphere, that in return helps to make this movie a fun and pleasant one to watch.Even though I liked the movie its style and atmosphere and the movie was also a good looking one, with an obvious big budget to spend, the special effects all were still slightly below par. It was quite distracting to see how bad some of its effects looked. Simply not acceptable for a big budget 2005 movie. Way better looking for the movie and more convincing are the creatures, that come from the Jim Henson's Creature Shop.But really the thing that prevents this movie from being a great one is its story. This movie would had been so much better if it actually had a story that was going somewhere. The movie now instead is the one silly adventure and crazy looking planet with their inhabitants after the other. The movie is lacking a clear main story and structure and everything just pretty much comes out of nowhere. Luckilly the movie is not being too long, or else it surely would had harmed the movie even more. The movie gets a bit annoying at times with its story, when its trying to be silly too often with its characters, strange settings or space objects. Nevertheless I still for most part enjoyed watching this movie a lot.For this movie they got a lot of famous, mostly, British actors. Most of them play sort of cameo roles, or at least it feels that way, since the characters just often suddenly tend to pop up. It works well for the humor at times but a others it's just plain annoying. Not everyone feels at place in this movie and at times it makes you wonder why these particular actor ever agreed to appear in this movie, also since their roles are not exactly the most challenging or memorable ones. Still a perfectly watchable silly movie, though you perhaps need to be a bit familiar with British cinema and everything that goes along with it, in order to be fully able to appreciate and enjoy it.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

15,view_and_review,Maybe I Should Read the Book,5,23 October 2017,"So I heard that the book is really good. That could be true. Most of the time the book is a lot better than the movie. This movie was far from impressive.Arthur (Martin Freeman) befriends Ford Perfect (Mos Def aka Yasiin Bey) while unbeknownst to him Ford was an alien just visiting Earth. Ford, being a good friend, takes Arthur with him on an interstellar hitchhiking voyage just before Earth is destroyed. And, as the title would suggest, the movie is about hitchhiking from galaxy to galaxy while avoiding being killed, captured or otherwise.The movie is very quirky with some weird characters. Weird characters don't ruin a movie--in fact they can sometimes enhance a movie--and I don't think that the characters were all that bad. The story was somewhat flat as well as its execution. I didn't find the movie funny or terribly interesting. Maybe I should read the book.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

Fortunately weird friend Ford Prefect helps him hitch his way off the doomed planet and into an intergalactic adventure which, frankly, Arthur is not keen on, especially when they run into the girl he fancied who blew him off at a party and the loud-mouthed ass she blew him off for.Douglas Adams' sci-fi humour makes its way to the big screen, restructured somewhat to fit feature film format. It is well cast, well adapted, the effects are impressive, and it holds up as a stand-alone feature.

17,evanston_dad,"So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish",6,26 January 2006,"I had the exact same feeling watching this film version of Douglas Adams' cult classic novel as I had reading it, so I guess in that regard you can say the movie is a very faithful adaptation of the book. I thought much of it was clever, and I laughed at individual lines, images and concepts, but overall I felt my attention drifting.Anyone who's read the book knows that its plot is an afterthought, and that utter absurdity is the flavor of the day. You're not supposed to really get involved in the story as much as you are supposed to bask in Adams' absurdity; in that way, reading ""Hitchhiker"" is like watching a Monty Python skit. The movie is at a disadvantage, because that kind of storytelling doesn't come as easily when you have to work in images rather than words, so the film makers do their best to create a linear story that makes basic sense. But they're fighting a losing battle, and as a result, the movie turns into a furious assemblage of one-liners, special effects and booming sound that comes rushing at you but never really engages you.All of the actors are decent, and some of them, notably Sam Rockwell, even have some inspired moments of comic kookiness. But by and large the performances are lost amid the frenzy. The film does have a splendid opening sequence, during which a catchy song, ""So Long and Thanks for All the Fish,"" plays while dolphins cavort, and this, more than anything else, is what I came away from the movie remembering. If there's any justice in the world, the tune will get a Best Song Academy Award nomination, and maybe at the actual ceremony, they can have a big pool of dolphins on hand to perform it. Take that Beyonce.This movie's o.k., takes absolutely no brain power to enjoy, and looks great, so you could do worse. However, it's not at all memorable and isn't one I would recommend you go out of your way to see.Grade: B",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
18,anaconda-40658,Hitchhiking Was Never So Much Fun.,10,4 June 2015,"Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (2005): Dir: Garth Jennings / Cast: Martin Freeman, Mos Def, Sam Rockwell, Zooey Deschanel, Bill Nighy: Inventive science fiction comedy about adventure. Martin Freeman learns that his best friend is an alien moments before the earth is destroyed. Lucky for him that he is spirited up to a spacecraft. Innovative and very funny, director Garth Jennings plays off satire elements of science fiction including a depressed robot named Marvin that will become the film's most beloved creation. Freeman does well as Arthur whose house is bulldozed moments before the Earth is destroyed. Mos Def plays his alien friend who ultimately introduces him to a new life within the galaxy. From there his function is basically to save the planet. Zooey Deschanel shines as the woman Freeman met briefly yet reunites with later. She is obviously set to become his love interest but at least her screen presence is amusing. Sam Rockwell steals scenes as a sort of galaxy President. He has the awkward physical capabilities needed to render a very different yet also funny performance. Bill Nighy is another perfect casting in this odd mix. If there is a message then it seems to satire the future and our paranoid existence. The result is an underrated and often amusing science fiction comedy complete with flashy costumes and exquisite sets that accompany a theme that hints at human ignorance.

19,movieman_kev,"it's OK, but stick with the far better mini-series",6,13 February 2006,"It's a tad hard to put my feelings about this version of the source material seeing as how I heard the radio play, read the books, saw the amazingly great mini-series, and even played the delightful text-based adventure game on my now ancient, then new computer. It's somewhat difficult to divorce my self from all of the aforementioned incarnations and just enjoy this film for what it was. Not to say that it was anything horrid, far from it. Some aspects of the adaption were pretty good. Martin Freeman (who was great in ""The Office) made an enjoyable Arthur Dent, Mos Def came off far better than I would have even thought as Ford. Those are two things of the top of my head. I'm sure if I were hard pressed I could think of other aspects I enjoyed, it's just that all in all the movie fails sadly. It goes off on tangents trying to capture more of the books than can be fathomed in a film of 109 minutes and throws in it's own sub-plots that I wasn't quite fond of. My humble opinion ultimately would be to stick with the early 80's mini-series as that will likely be the definitive adaption that we'll likely see on either the big or small screen.My Grade: C+",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
20,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy,8,1 June 2005,"Resistance is useless! Don't panic! The answer is... 42! I've read Douglas Adams' book The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy once, as a young kid, so I can't really remember the details, and therefore, can't comment from a purist's point of view (heh, wish I had the Point of View Gun). What I can do however, is review the movie as it is, from a cinematic experience.And it's fantastic! From the opening narrative, characterization, beautiful stunning CGI, especially on the creation of Earth, this film seems to do no wrong. The wit and dry humour play an important part, though some might not get all the jokes. And key to it all is the intelligent way in which the creators recreate The Hitchhiker's Guide - where slick animation vividly brings forth the tips and tricks to living life in the Galaxy.The characters are always the highlight, and rightfully so. Who can forget Marvin the manically depressed robot, who (!) is brought to life on the silver screen. Sam Rockwell shines as the narcissistic President of the Galaxy Zaphod Beeblebrox. Martin Freeman does a commendable job as Brit Arthur Dent, whose home is set for demolition for a highway (oh, the irony of it all), and Zooey Deschanel provides the eye candy as sassy Trillian. Mos Def as Ford Perfect rounds off the galaxy adventurers. The cameo by John Malkovich proves hilarious as Humma Kavula, religious cult leader waiting for the next big sneeze - Bless you! And I can sense the audience eagerly awaiting the appearance of Deep Thought, spouting that immortal line, the answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe and everything...While you wonder at the marvels of technology in this sci-fi film (hey, there's a spoof from Star Wars), underlying it all is a simple love story that develops between Arthur and Trillian, and the challenges of admitting your affections to your partner.Stay tuned during the end credits, as you get another Hitchhiker's Guide entry, which explains the aftermath of what happened after Arthur uttered the final words.I've enjoyed this film tremendously, and I feel it should appeal to non-fans of the book as well, probably reining them in to read it. I know I would.To Douglas, for creating this classic and developing new material for the film. So long, and thanks for the fish!",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
21,Mr-Fusion,Hits the right notes,7,25 May 2017,"It's been a few years since I've read the book, but it's one I hold dear. The good news here is that the movie version feels right; it's the all-important blend of Monty Python and science fiction. It's Martin Freeman dropped into one absurd situation after the next (starting with the complete destruction of his home planet), the eccentric characters that ultimately form the group, and Douglas Adams' wry sense of humor sprinkled throughout. And I don't think there's any weak link among this cast (Sam Rockwell steals the movie with his bizarre blend of Elvis and Dubya . . . but then Rockwell is a master thief), but each of the other characters feels suitably cast.Evidently, the box office didn't merit a sequel; and I'm not gonna lie, that's a disappointment. I would like to see these actors flesh out the rest of the series.7/10",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
22,ShadeGrenade,"""So long, and thanks for all the fish!""",7,6 June 2012,"I missed 'The Hitch-Hiker's Guide To The Galaxy' when it originally appeared on Radio 4 in 1978, so when I saw the author had written a book version a year or so later I snapped it up. I loved every page! Brilliantly funny. Almost 'Monty Python' in space. It begins with everyman 'Arthur Dent' waking up one morning to find that his house is to be demolished to make way for a new bypass. He protests by laying down in front of a bulldozer. An old friend, 'Ford Prefect' ( who happens to be an alien from Betelgeuse, and not from Guildford, after all ) lures him away and tells him that the world will end in a short time - a Vogon Constructor fleet is about to demolish the Earth to make way for a new hyper-spatial bypass. Arthur and Ford hitch a ride aboard one of the Vogon ships...A television version went out on B.B.C.-2 in 1981 and, to my pleasant surprise, turned out to be rather good. But one person unhappy with it was author Douglas Adams. He dreamt of it being made into a big budget feature film. In 2005, after years of false starts and dashed hopes, it finally happened. Tragically, he never saw it as he had passed away four years earlier. What he would have made of it is anybody's guess. His script was rewritten by Karey Kirkpatrick and directed by Garth Jennings. Martin Freeman replaced Simon Jones in the role of 'Arthur', with Zooey Deschanel making a fetching 'Trillian'. Americans Sam Rockwell and Mos Def took on the roles of 'Zaphod Beeblebrox' and 'Ford Prefect' respectively. Stephen Fry was the obvious choice to be the 'Voice Of The Book', and Bill Nighy's 'Slartibartfast' is a treat. I enjoyed the film on the whole but was aware that it was not as good as it could and should have been. The lack of a plot was not a drawback on radio. It is on the big screen. Once the Earth blows up, the narrative fragments into a series of sketches, linked by 'Guide' extracts. A lot of these simply do not work, such as the sequence involving John Malkovitch's 'Humma Kavula'. They should have created an original plot and dumped the best jokes into it like raisins in a scone. The use of the original Tim Souster theme as incidental music and Adams' face appearing at the end were lovely touches.The story was also dumbed down by the addition of a romantic sub-plot involving Arthur and Trillian and the restoration of the Earth at the end. Presumably so that overseas audiences would not find the whole thing too depressing. Like the film version of Spike Milligan's 'Puckoon', 'Guide' had all the right ingredients for a good film, but they weren't mixed properly. I sincerely hope that someday someone has another crack at it.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
23,JamesHitchcock,May The Farce Be With You,8,21 May 2005,"Like many of those who have seen this film, I am a long-standing admirer of the comic vision of the late Douglas Adams, having grown up with the original radio programmes, TV shows and novels. This vision can best be described as Doctor Who meets Monty Python; the film, like its predecessors in other media, is a mixture of science-fiction parody, tongue-in-cheek philosophical speculation, social comment and Pythonesque surrealism.The plot starts with Arthur Dent, a middle-class thirty-something Englishman, protesting against the planned demolition of his cottage to make way for a new bypass. Arthur is warned, however, by his best friend Ford Prefect (who turns out not to be from Guildford, as Arthur had thought, but from a small planet in the neighbourhood of Betelgeuse) that the entire planet Earth is itself scheduled for demolition to make room for an inter-galactic expressway. Arthur and Ford manage to escape the destruction of the planet by hitching a lift on the spaceship sent to do the job. The rest of the film chronicles their odyssey through the Galaxy accompanied by Ford's cousin, the manic, narcissistic, two-headed Galactic President Zaphod Beeblebrox, Zaphod's girlfriend Trisha, and Marvin, a depressive robot. Their faithful companion is the Hitchhiker's Guide itself, a talking book. In the course of their journey they discover that the Earth was, prior to its demolition, really a gigantic computer designed to calculate the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe and Everything (the answer to the question having already been determined to be 42).Adams's humour was very much within the eccentric British tradition of the Pythons and the Goons, and my main fear was that in the course of its transition to the cinema screen the story would be Americanised beyond recognition, with, say, Tom Hanks playing Arthur as a New Yorker and the Voice of the Book being provided by Michael Douglas. This danger was largely avoided. Arthur remains firmly English and Stephen Fry is excellent as the Voice of the Book, both authoritative and friendly. (This is a particularly important role, as it is the Book that gives voice to most of Adams's philosophical or surreal jokes). Both Zaphod and Trisha are played by Americans, but this makes as in the television series these parts were played with American accents, albeit by British actors. Sam Rockwell is excellent as Zaphod; I cannot improve on the reviewer who described him as the love-child of George W Bush and Freddie Mercury. As for Trisha, I actually preferred Zooey Deschanel's interpretation to Sandra Dickinson's. (Dickinson's squeaky-voiced astrophysicist, the love-child of Albert Einstein and Jayne Masfield, was never the strongest character in the television version). Other performances I liked were from Alan Rickman as Marvin and from Bill Nighy as the eccentric planet designer Slartibartfast, winner of a design award for his treatment of the Norwegian fiords. I did not much care for Mos Def's American Ford Prefect, but that is probably because I am so used to David Dixon's very different interpretation of the role as the Betelgeusian equivalent of a supercilious English public schoolboy. Those who come to the film without having seen the TV version are unlikely to have the same problem.Inevitably, some changes have been made in the transition of the story into a new medium. The film is more structured than the television and radio versions, with something closer to a coherent plot. Arthur is a less passive character, doing more than wander about in a bewildered search for cups of tea, and a romantic subplot is introduced between him and Trisha. More use is made of the Vogons, the most bad- tempered, bureaucratic, officious and callous race in the Galaxy, but this is a change for the better; they make splendidly comic villains. (Are Vogons entirely fictitious? I suspect that they make up most of the staff of the European Commission).More controversially, the film has a happier ending than anything found in Adams's work with Slartibartfast and his fellow planet builders taking on the role of benevolent creator deities. I am not sure that this would have appealed to Adams, whose pessimistic world-view can be summed up by his theory that if anyone ever discovers exactly what the Universe is for and why it is here, it will instantly disappear and be replaced by something even more bizarre and inexplicable. (There is, of course, another theory that states that this has already happened). I wonder, however, if this is the end of the story; at the end of the film the friends set off for the Restaurant at the End of the Universe, which was, of course, the title of the second in Adams's five-book ""trilogy"". Could this be a hint that a sequel is planned? It would appear that we ""Hitchhiker"" fans can be divided into two groups, those who think that the film represents a betrayal of the original concept and those who are glad that Adams's unique comic vision is reaching a fresh audience via the big screen. I count myself firmly in the latter camp. This is not, perhaps, a perfect adaptation of the story, but it is a very good one, much better than I had feared it might be. 8/10",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
24,Robert_duder,"Some will like, others will not",6,7 May 2005,"The Hitchhikers Guide To The Galaxy is one of those films that I think is grossly misrepresented in the trailers. It's hyped and shown as an intergalactic action film, along the lines of Star Wars, but instead the film is a 100% comedy, with a hint of parody, more along the lines of Spaceballs.Guide To The Galaxy is the story of Arthur Dent, a down on his luck earthman who is fortunate enough to have a friend from another world, Ford Prefect. Ford discovers that Earth is being destroyed in order to make room for an intergalactic highway. So he grabs Arthur and then hitchhike a ride onto a passing space ship with a race of beings called Vogons. They aren't an evil race per se but more of a chronically annoying, politically powerful race of beings. When Arthur and Ford don't please the Vogons they are shot off into space and just by pure luck get picked up by none other than The President Of The Galaxy, who is also one of Fords relatives. The President and coincidentally Arthur's love interest from Earth are on a search for the answer to life. They believe this answer or at the very least the world's best question exists on a planet where a super computer has been built to figure it all out. So together the four of them, on a hijacked super ship head out into the galaxy to find this computer. They are being chased by the bureaucratic Vogon's who want their ship back, and also believe the President has been kidnapped. They are joined on their quest by the manic depressive Robot Marvin and their unstoppably optimistic ship.If this film had been released in the seventies or eighties it would be an absolute classic today. It seemed under budget, and rather jokingly created. I have not read the book or seen any movies/plays etc so this is my first involvement with The Guide but I just wasn't expecting a level of slapstick parody to it. I certainly won't bash a film for being not full of special effects, there is nothing wrong with that, I just wasn't prepared for what the film was and what I thought it was. I think kids might enjoy this movie more than adults. The acting is not bad, and the stars of the film do an adequate job. One of the highlights and more amusing parts of the film is the adorable and very funny Marvin, the manic depressive Robot. I think the film is definitely trying to convey a message in a funny, English kinda way, and I think I might enjoy this more on a second viewing but for the time being I have to call it the way I see it. The film seemed very ""english"" to me and it's not surprising at all that writer Douglas Adams was a writer for Monty Python because I could definitely see that flavor to it. Perhaps worth taking the kids too but I'm not sure you'll enjoy it as much as they might. 6/10",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
25,paul2001sw-1,"Mostly harmless, but nothing more",5,15 February 2009,"First it was a radio series, then a book, then a television programme; but the late Douglas Adams always dreamed that his cult sci-fi comedy, 'The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy', would be remade as a movie. He yearned for superior special effects to what he considered to be lame ones in the low budget BBC version; but for many of us who love the originals, the manifestly inadequate budgets were part of the charm. So it's a surprising relief that now that a film has finally been made, the visuals are in fact similar in tone, with a 1970s aesthetic (although a little more cartoonish, reflecting the fact that the sort of imagery that was state-of-the-art thirty years ago now requires a greater sense of self-mockery). On the downside, Zaphod Beedlebrox's second head (the appearance of which was a major bone of contention for Adams in the television version) still looks rubbish. As for the cast, it's more American than that of the original. The voice of the book (Stephen Fry, in this incarnation) is almost identical to his predecessor, while Martin Freeman, as Arthur Dent, interprets the role originally but not inappropriately. But Sam Rockwell's Zaphod disappoints, and Alan Rickman's Marvin doesn't even attempt to capture the depths of doleful self-hatred previously on display, substituting a more sarcastic, almost wry, outlook. But the real problem is with the increased pace necessary to make a motion picture. The plot fairly rattles along, but it makes the story feel much more just a collection of gags; indeed, with a concentration on the activities of the bureaucratic (and frankly boring) Vogons, it makes the film seem far more rooted in the 1970s (Monty Python comes obviously to mind at several points) than any of the earlier versions. While many of the best jokes are cut, even some relating to the ultimate question (which are really the ones most essential to the plot). Still, those that remain are still great, and it's also interesting to think: Adams was ridiculing futurology when he wrote this stuff, not indulging in it; but with Wikipedia available on an iPhone, the something remarkably close to the Guide itself has come into being in just three decades.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

It feels largely inconsequential, in a way. I mean, I suppose that's part of the point. However, it sort of feels like an attempt to normalise (and further commercialise) an inherently non-normal narrative, landing awkwardly between run-of-the-mill and unconventional without really getting the benefits of either category. It's not bad, by any means, and its general quirk could easily come across as charming to some audience members. For me, though, it doesn't really land. It's the sort of thing that just sort of unfolds in front of you, never quite reaching its obvious potential. It'll certainly appeal to some more than others. 5/10.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
27,bowmanblue,"Not perfect, but fun",7,10 July 2017,"In case you don't know, 'The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy' was a science-fiction book by Douglas Adams which developed a major cult following. This was then immortalised during the eighties in the British six-part TV series of the same name which, despite its low budget, (seriously – the man with 'two heads' has to be seen to be believed, trust me, it's no 'Avatar!') was regarded very highly as a faithful adaptation and added to the following.Since then, the author, Douglas Adams, had tried numerous times to get a big screen version made, but, despite the fans supporting this, it took until 2005 for this to happen. And, despite the film also being written by Adams, for various reasons it received only mixed reactions.It follows the original book/TV show's format of a man about to have his house bulldozed to the ground to make way for a motorway, only to discover that aliens are literally about to bulldoze the entire planet Earth for similar reasons. While the entire planet are mercilessly blown up, our everyman – Arthur Dent – is rescued by his best friend (who conveniently turns out to be an alien on a research mission to our planet and in possession with the titular Guide to the Galaxy) and they end up on the run in a spaceship, piloted by various freaks of the universe.Now, first of all let me say the cast in – on the whole – fantastic. Martin Freeman (from the UK's 'Office,' but more recently 'Bilbo' from 'The Hobbit' is great as the long suffering last surviving earthling and Alan Rickman voices the 'paranoid android' Marvin to perfection. And, while we have plenty of good cameos such as John Malkovich and Bill Nighy, the overall cast are let down by Mos Def's 'Ford Prefect' and Zooey Deschanel's Trillion (aka the obligatory love interest for Arthur). These two seem to have little made of them apart from making up the numbers and drag the cast down.However, the overall feel lifts the film back up again. Of course most of the special effects are CGI, but there's a great feel for many of the monsters who are all there courtesy of Jim Henson's creature effects workshop. The sets are also amazing and the universe really does feel alive with weird and wonderful creations. Overall, I enjoyed it. However, I do wonder whether a lot of the dislike came from those who, like me, know the WHOLE story.You see, unless I'm really missing something, the film doesn't have an end. Or at least not a proper one. If you've read the book or seen the TV show, you know the answer to various major questions (and I'm not just talking about the number 42!). However, the film doesn't address many critical plot elements that are set up. Perhaps this is meant to be the first half and, because of its limited success, we never got to see the sequel/second half which would have answered the questions we die-hard fans were expecting. Therefore, it did leave me wanting more than the film offered.For all its plus points I wanted to see the end, which I only got a sort of ending that serves only as a midway gap that could be considered an ending if you haven't read the book/seen the TV show. However, I do own the film on DVD and watch it from time to time. Like I say, it does have enough going for it to make it nice and light-heartedly watchable. Although, I do wonder whether the 'big budget treatment' that's been afforded to this film wouldn't have been better spent on a new TV adaptation that could have fleshed out all the characters who seem a little one dimensional and also given us the ending that was a lot better than the film.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

I believe I see it rarely on IMDb, more caused by politically charged films rather then by entertaining sci-fi as this movie tries and in my opinion succeeds to be.Yes, I am more on the fan side. Douglas Adams died in 2001 but I believe he would have liked the result of his project. Garth Jennings read the Guide in a different style than big screen sci-fi, his approach has a minor British touch, although he uses from time to time in an ironic way gadgets from the commercial Lucas side of the genre. His focus is however on humor and sensitivity, and it's important for him to make you understand that whatever different are forms of life in the infinite Universe what matters is really how good is the tea in the tiny China cup. Special effects are retro in style, Muppets characters are preferred to computer graphics, and when computers are used they look more like pre-CGI graphics from the 80s.

33,Bored_Dragon,So long and thanks for all the fish,6,28 October 2018,"This humorous SF adventure is an adaptation of the eponymous novel by Douglas Adams, one of my favorite books and a book that can not be adequately translated into a two-hour film. The screenplay was written by Adams himself, so I was very surprised that the source material was so terribly butchered. The film not only lacks many important details, but the entire large parts of the original story, and some things that are not in the book are needlessly added. Still, the film is not that bad, because it kept the spirit of the book and it's full of Adams's recognizable humor. If you have not read ""The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"" you probably won't have as many objections as the fans of the book, but in that case, I recommend you not to watch it, because it would spoil the book that you simply must read sooner or later. And if you did read it, you will be disappointed. I did enjoy it, but I think I more enjoyed the memories of the book that the film has awakened than the movie itself.On the technical side, the movie is pretty good. Camera, directing, effects, everything is in place. The cast is excellent, but unfortunately totally unused, because the characterization is very poor, almost non-existent. This is probably the biggest flaw of the film, because the humor in the novel is based primarily on the characterization and character development. Only the character and performance of Martin Freeman are somewhat worthy of the source material. On the one hand, I have the urge to give it the lowest possible rating because of the desecration of this iconic book, but at the other, I am aware that the Guide is impossible to translate to this form (TV series could possibly work) and that the film, given the constraints, is pretty much success, technically well-made and quite fun. Any rating on a scale from one to ten could be reasonably justified, and since I can not decide, I'll give it symbolic42P.S.

Perhaps it was high expectations, unlike those who may compare this movie to the more disastrous television series, that made this movie less than what I had hoped. The imaginary visions that filled my head while experiencing the audiobook version did not seem to translate so successfully. Live human actors in what in essence is a kooky, but rather intelligent commentary of Douglas Adams (the original author of the books and source material), like Galaxy Quest (1999) did not have quite the same environmental element in which to perform. Instead, the extraordinary fantastic setting of Douglas Adams may only have been best realized in animated form (of the current technological era). The humor and the unreality or complexity of Adam's Hitchhiker's Guide may require something almost impossible to accomplish using live actors.Marvin the robot, the one real almost unhuman character in the movie was the most successful of all the performances. Douglas Adams' own narrative from the book was interesting, but not always smoothly played out on the big screen. The special effects in most cases were great. Yet the truly magical components of the book seems to be spattered out into the movie...where the characters were almost lost in the whole layout.The movie was uneven in it pacing, sometimes coming to a near stop, the plot from the book having to be forced out in an attempt to bring to life the actual contents of the book.

35,The-Sarkologist,"Yeah, it's funny, but don't expect the original",7,2 November 2012,"What do you get when you take an absurdist and existentialist text and Americanise it? This film. Okay, this is not a bad film, and yes some of the aspects of this film such as Marvin the Paranoid Android and Deep Thought, made this film better than the television series, there were other aspects, such as giving it a plot, an antagonist, and a happy ending, that pretty much destroyed it. Okay, in its many reincarnations, from a radio play to a series of books to a television series, the story morphed into different forms, this movie is sort of like the image you see of an ape evolving into a man only to land up as a fat slob sitting at a computer. This movie is that fat slob.Now, the original book outlined how Zaphod Beeblebrox stole the galactic election to become president and then proceeded to steal a spaceship, and this was not brought out in the television series, so I did appreciate it when then returned to this in the movie. However, taking the Vogons from simply being a rather bad tempered an bureaucratic race that destroyed the Earth to actually making them antagonists in the film, as well as adding a scene where they go and rescue Trillian from the Vogons after she is captured, sort of destroyed this. Oh, and bringing all the Vogons up at the end to have a final battle, once again undermined the original absurdity of the book, and the original series.Oh, I should also mention that throwing in a powerful weapon simply reeks of what one would expect from Hollywood. Okay, the weapon may be a 'point of view' gun, which allows people to see what it is like from somebody else's point of view (namely a woman) but that did not really gel with me, as did the relationship that developed between Trillian and Arthur. That simply never happened in the books. Even when the books did decline after the second one, it still had an absurdist and meaningless ending whose real purpose was for Arthur to finally end a painful and meaningless life.Take for instance the whole concept of finding the answer to Life, the Universe, and Everything. The whole absurdity of having the answer as a number, and then being asked to find a question (which ends up being a mathematical equation that, as it turns out, does not have the answer of 42) was the whole nature of this absurdist story. However, the film changes this to having the answer as 'yes' and the question as being 'will you be my girlfriend'. Seriously, this is clearly the worst case of Americanisation I have ever seen. To think that Douglas Adams even had a hand in writing this movie in this way.Okay, in the form that it appeared it did end up making a profit, but is that what literature has become these days, simply a means of generating a profit. Okay, writers have always wanted to make a profit, but what happened to the gritty and dark view of the world seen through the eyes of Shakespeare, or the morale questions that come out of Greek Tragedy, or even the absurdist plays of Samuel Beckett? No, instead we have the plot of boy meets girl, boy looses girl, and boy gets girl again and they live happily ever after (because nothing changes after the movie ends, just like real life – NOT!).Anyway, this film is still really good for a laugh, and I still enjoy it (I have watched it a few times now), but in the end, I would rather read the books, and even watch the original series again with its ending that leaves you going, Huh?",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

Having grown up with the TV series, the radio series, and the books (in that order), I have certain preconceptions and expectations about Hitchhiker's that this film didn't always deliver.The bits that worked really well - the dolphin song and dance number at the beginning ('So Long And Thanks For All The Fish), and their return to the remodelled Earth at the end; the journey Arthur and Slartibartfast take through the factory floor at Magrathea and the Earth Mk II (the creation of the oceans, the Himalayas, etc.); the Vogon bureaucratic centre / job centre (where the original TV series Marvin waits in line!); the planet where the travellers are attacked by mean looking rubber spade things; and the bits with the Guide itself - new animations, updated from the (excellent) hand-done ones on TV.Casting was hit and miss for me - Martin Freeman was OK but was not my idea of Arthur Dent (perhaps Dent will be forever Simon Jones for those who saw/heard him first - here he is a cameo as the Ghostly Image warning the Heart of Gold not to approach the mystery planet). Mos Def was just wrong as Ford Prefect - too American, too trendy.Zooey Deschanel was the perfect Trillian - you can believe this girl is an astrophysicist (although the line which tells you that is cut). Sam Rockwell as Zaphod. No! He was really irritating me right from his first appearance although by the time Ford was squeezing lemons into his brain to make him think the character got funnier. The two heads are hopeless but perhaps an improvement on a shoulder-mounted rubber one.Others are very good in smaller parts - Bill Nighy as Slartibartfast, John Malkovich as new character Humma Kavula, Steve Pemberton as Mr Prosser, and of course the voice-only talent (Bill Bailey, Helen Mirren, Alan Rickman, and Stephen Fry as the Book).What I missed the most were favourite lines - the whole 'Beware of the Leopard' sequence from the beginning between Arthur Dent and Mr Prosser; the 'Please enjoy your trip through this door' perky personality doors on the Heart of Gold; the 'turning into a penguin' and 'monkeys writing Hamlet' sequence; and the 'trouble with my lifestyle' section on Magrathea.To make up for it the special effects are very good and there are lots of new creatures such as the jewel encrusted crab and the tiny running robot. The Vogons look good as well.The film itself has a happy ending which is at odds with the book and all other adaptations - it also ends at a different point to both radio and TV series, just as the characters are off to the Restaurant at the End of the Universe.

38,Dr_Coulardeau,Incongruity as a fine art,10,11 November 2008,"That's probably not a masterpiece, not even as good as the radio show. But it is good. The main handicap for this film is that everything that was pure imagination on the radio show has to become visible, visual, hence no longer requiring the audience's imagination but satisfying their visual curiosity. Then of course this film has to use visual surprises and visual absurd hiatuses or oxymora. Thus the main character has to be in his pajamas all along since he was ""captured"" in them. A little bit skimpy for long distance travelling. Then I must admit they did a tremendous job at finding incongruous and funny situations even if some of them are trite, like being master-minded by plain mice, though they look cute our masters in their little fragile beings, and all the more fragile when they are crushed as flat as a cartoon drawing by some kind of torturing device. Apart from that it does not have any kind of deep meaning. It is all funny and it does not aim at being anything else, British funny of course, so rather just silly or funny ah ah, but not hilarious or brain meddling funny. The radio show was a lot more mysterious and brainy because it was entirely relying on the words and it was at times extremely witty.

39,digitalbeachbum,Could have been so much more.,5,20 June 2020,"I was first turned on to Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy when I listened to the BBC broadcast over the FM radio on the weekend. I think it was the start of a love affair with these sort of stories and the comedic value of the fantasy genre.After I listened to the BBC broadcast, I ordered the script and then the book, then the unabridged version. Along with So Long For All the Fish and The Restaurant at the End of the Universe and all the other books. I remember also the game, the text version of it like Zork, which I played on my Apple //e.This movie did OK to support those memories of the original story, but it wasn't great. It could have been better because Hollowood got in the way of creativity. They got in the way of doing the movie the way it should have been done.I think there are some really great casting choices, like using Alan Rickman was a very wise choice for Marvin. I thought using Stephen Fry as a narrator was good. Martin Freeman was a good choice for Arthur. I didn't like Mos Def as Ford, but I thought he did a good job.I believe what failed this movie was the 109 minutes of run time. There is far too much from the book which was cut out and while the overall meaning of the story was kept, the little things are what counted. Zooey and Sam are fairly good choices. And not to forget Helen Mirren and John Malkovich or Bill Nighy.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

Unfortunately, the social period with which this supposed modernization identified this work was the late 1970's, early 1980's. Bad, Disney! Bad!

Well this movie is precisely the opposite. It's just quirky and charming and clever enough not to be hated, when at the same time it's a touch long and a tad too boring at times to be loved. It's certainly a very original concept which is always great to see and from what I hear it does the book proud, but it just didn't seem to have that edge which I was expecting. I thought there have been a few opportunities at jokes missed, considering the earth just came to an end within the space of a few minutes, but there were a few others in there which were quite funny.The best part about the ""you'll neither love it, nor hate it"" theory is that you can't really be too disappointed. So if you're undecided as to whether you want to see this one for any reason just take that into consideration.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
42,Chris Knipp,"A friendly nod, and a warning",7,2 May 2005,"""The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"" is the long-delayed evocation of a late-Seventies English radio program created by Douglas Adams that earlier led to a TV series, books and many other spin-offs. As reincarnated here, it's warm and enjoyable stuff -- relaxed, speculative, anti-bureaucratic, anti-establishment, and anti-religion. But above all two questions remain: does this really mean anything if you don't' know the ""Hitchhiker's Guide"" already? And, if you do, will you ultimately find it satisfying? And I can't give you the answer.The people in it are good. Zooey Duchanel is quietly appealing, Mos Def full of humor and smart energy. Alan Rickman is priceless if a bit one-note as a depressed and grumpy robot. Sam Rockwell charms and astonishes as a popinjay President of the Galaxy -- a shallow Texas charmer with Bushian intonations who's got two flip-flop alternating heads because ""you can't be president with a whole brain,"" and says ""I'm president of the galaxy; I don't get a lot of time for reading."" Bill Nihy is perfect as the man at the end of the world who's one of the re-designers of planet earth. John Malkovich manages to seem different, yet unmistakably himself. He has the most extraordinary moment, when he jumps up onto a table.Everything comes apart in the movie ""Guide,"" then gets put together again. There's an implication that a working universe isn't so much a matter of divine intervention as of good old fashioned English cooperation. Arthur Dent (Martin Freeman of ""The Office"") the Brit everyman whose misadventure begins the story, is saved by his alien pal Ford Prefect (Def) just at the last minute as planet earth's about to be demolished. That's when Prefect provides him with a towel and shows him how to hitch intergalactic rides. We occasionally get peeks at the guide book, which allows the filmmakers to indulge their gift for digital graphic design.As Dent and Prefect wander about through space, a complicated, meandering plot unfolds including, among other things, a search for the secret of all things,a porcine race of bureaucrats called the Vogons (nasty creatures who like to recite bad poetry), and two little inquiring girls who turn into mice.The excellent cast helps keep technical tricks from taking over, but the ""Hitchhiker's Guide"" movie is richer in special effects and sci-fi adventures than Russell's ""I Heart Huckabees."" It's more exciting and better-looking too; unfortunately it's also got some of those numbing noises that pepper children's animations nowadays and can occasionally make non-cineplex denizens like me start to nod off.If like myself you don't know the books or the TV or radio series, you can't say if long-time devotees will see this movie as a travesty or a delight. At least one I've consulted (MaryAnn Johanson, The Flick Filosopher) not only says it's a travesty; she goes on a nearly two-thousand-word rant about it. Mind you, this movie is clever, independent, and good natured, not an altogether common mix. It's not, however, a movie I'll want to go back to. It has moments of fun or surprise, mostly thanks to the good cast. But it hasn't got the sustained and acid wit you find in any segment of Monty Python. And it's a pretty sure bet Disney has watered down the author's original combination of passionate science, non-conformism, and intellectual inquiry. They've also added a simplistic narrative arc the original author of these meandering intellectual explorations wouldn't have countenanced, which drives the aforementioned devotee nearly hysterical. (She admits the cast is terrific, and finds that particularly frustrating.) This much is quite evident to an outsider: there's nothing like the justice done to the Douglas Adams books by Garth & Co. here that Peter Jackson did for the Rings Trilogy. _________________",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

I disagree with Ebert and Roper, the effects were not cheesy, the characters were amusing to say the least. A big thumbs up for me. Althuogh I didn't see the original T.V. miniseries, but I hope it was as good has this version. The story centers around Arthur Dent(Martin Freeman)a man with no luck, he fails to get a date with a beautiful female(Zoey Dechanel), his house is facing the wreckers ball. But his best friend Ford(The ever so impressive Mos Def) tells him that he is an alien from another planet, and Earth is headed for demolition. While earth is being destroyed, Ford grabs Arthur and hitches a ride aboard the ship. But as soon has they are caught aboard the ship, they are tossed out in space, but are soon picked up by the space President(Sam Rockwell) who pretty acts like he is drunk all the time, is Fords half brother.

44,ebiros2,Mean hearted sense of humor,1,13 December 2005,"I'll confess that I never read the book, or saw the TV series, so I didn't have any expectation when I saw this movie, but I understood after watching it for a few minutes, this movie is about Great Britain and you sort of had to adjust your mindset to that culture. But after seeing this movie for half an hour, I had to think ""Is this what they see as humor ?"". I was shuddering at the cold and mean spirited sense of humor sprinkled all over this movie. Maybe they see something smart and funny about it, but I sure didn't. The movie makes sarcastic jokes about things that aren't funny and poke fun at each other. If there was a plot or an idea in this movie that they wanted to convey, they certainly didn't succeed. This movie erratically fluctuated from one scene to another and didn't have anything binding them together. This movie actually made me feel attacked violently by its crudeness. It was one of the few movies that left saddest impression after seeing it. Entertaining ? absolutely not. It was very antithesis of what I consider a ""good time"". I see that lot of feedback expectedly is from Great Britain, and many people seemed to have liked this movie.

45,dfranzen70,"Mostly true to original, fun for newbies too",8,11 November 2005,"Don't panic. This is not as cheesy as the 1980s BBC miniseries, but it's also not as Hollywoodized as one might expect. That means you purists out there, you Douglas Adams fanboys and girls, aren't going to be disappointed, and those of you who have somehow avoided reading any of the Hitchhiker books won't be confused.On a perfectly otherwise-ordinary Thursday, Briton Arthur Dent awoke to see a bulldozer about to knock down his unimaginative house to make way for a bypass. And that, as it turned out, was the most believable thing to happen to him from then on, as he winds up traveling across the galaxy, encountering numerous weird characters and huge leaps in logic. With him is his longtime friend Ford, who up until that day Arthur had thought was simply an out-of-work actor. Turns out Ford's a researcher for the Guide of the title, and he's able to rescue Arthur from Earth before our fair planet is obliterated to make way for a bypass.Why bother with more plot details than that, really? That's all you need to know. Arthur is Everyman, and everyone else is incredibly odd. But not so odd that your brain's not proportionally entertained. And entertained you will be! Check out some of the fun stuff the future apparently holds. There'll be these tiny fish that can translate any language after you put them in your ear. Fantastic! And then there's another device that detects what you want to eat by analyzing your mind.Now, I've read all of the books, and I've seen the miniseries, and I've even listened to the old radio play (on tape, remember those?). Yes, there are some differences - they couldn't cram everything from the first book into one movie - including the addition of a character. But fret not, Douglas Adams himself made these changes, and they feel rather seamless. So that's a huge plus. And if you did see the miniseries back in the day, you might recall how woefully low-budget the effects were. Ah, this time around the Infinite Improbabilty Drive looks VERY improbable, indeed.The movie manages somehow to capture the spirit of the books, which is no small feat when you consider how absurd the original plot really was. Plus, there's that omnipresent dry British wit, but somehow THAT comes across as well.The entire cast is excellent, but I particularly loved Alan Rickman as the voice of Marvin the Paranoid Android. Perfect, absolutely as I'd imagined him to be. ""Life... don't talk to me about life,"" moans Marvin. It's also fun to watch Mos Def as Ford, Sam Rockwell as Zaphod, and the ethereal Zooey Deschanel as Trillian, with her big eyes and flighty charm. No, really, they were all simply smashing.

46,drqshadow-reviews,Expertly-Realized Visuals Can't Bail Out a Cloudily Interpreted Storyline,6,2 June 2012,"Let's be honest, this is about as close to an unfilmable property as it gets. Between the vast array of budget-busting concepts, characters and settings, the niche-settled sense of humor (granted, it's a rather large niche, but a niche all the same) and Douglas Adams's inimitably flirty, hilarious knack for description, it's a wonder this was even filmed because it seems so perfectly suited to a non-visual medium. But it's a popular title and Hollywood's long since run out of fresh, moneymaking ideas, so after two-plus decades in development hell, somebody finally gave it a green light. And, god bless it, the thing actually performs admirably well in a number of unexpected ways. For starters, the visual design is a raging success; a creative wet dream, it's positively teeming with expertly-realized concepts. The dozens of alien races look magnificent, the competing spacecraft are wildly varied and thoroughly interesting, the guide itself is a note-perfect modernization of an aging concept, and the infamous factory on Magrathea is jaw-droppingly realized. The casting is deeply inspired, too, with Alan Rickman, Martin Freeman and Zooey Deschanel born to play their roles as Marvin, Arthur and Trillian, respectively. The only snag lies in the story, which is half- baked at best, cripplingly over-ambitious at worst and even occasionally, inexcusably, dull. Too often it stretches too thin, striving to please everyone and instead falling universally short. The bare threads of Adams's original storyline are still there, plain as day, and they still work excellently. But they're backseated by far too many indulgent side-treks and wink-nod- grins for anyone's good. It's a commendable effort that does an awful lot right - far more than I was prepared to accept - but can't quite get over the hump into unbridled success.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
47,Chris_Docker,"Sugar frosted version of the cult classic, devoid of substance but will entertain many nonetheless",5,3 May 2005,"When major cult characters are transferred to the big screen there can be inevitable problems. What works on TV, radio or paperback may not quite come off when it 'goes big', with vast amounts of money thrown at it and the critical attention of the millions of fans who have got to know it in a homely and lovable way  not to mention the cinema going hordes who see it for the first time and form a fast judgement.Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is based on a story by the late Douglas Adams' (who also helped with the screenplay). It follows the haphazard adventures of earth-geek Arthur Dent and his crony Ford Prefect. Ford Prefect soon turns out to be not altogether human, but an alien who is researching a new edition of the galaxy's best selling book (from which the title of our story is taken). The two become closer buddies by circumstances  especially being thrown together as the earth is demolished to make way for an intergalactic highway.The film is less sci-fi than oddball comedy. It has more in common with 3rd Rock from the Sun (or even Monty Python) than mainstream spaceship stories. The zany characters  Trillian, Zaphod Beeblebrox, Vogons, Slartibartfast  appear in rapid succession with even zanier gadgets and situations like flying dolphins, a chronically depressed robot, and the Infinite Improbability Drive.Most of the audience will love it or hate it with very little in between. For many fans, it's a chance to touch base with many lovable characters, quite well acted for the most part, and have a 'Hitchhiker Fix' that will work, alone or in company of other addicts, and even for repeat viewings. Newcomers may just revel in almost two hours of utter silliness. For others, it will be a travesty of the original, a mindless money-making exercise that disembowels a unique creation and serves up dross. There is no pause for reflection, very little character or context building, nothing that can be called mind-provoking. The Disney 'plot-police' have served up the mere empty husks of genius, forced too much material into the time available to make any of it digestible, and given us a movie that provokes subdued chuckles rather than gut wrenching laughter. Where Adams' original pulled you in to explore ideas from a totally different perspective, the current movie has less intellectual appeal than Mickey Mouse. With the book you had to stop and wipe the tears of laughter from your ears, but with the film you simply sit there as a panoply of seemingly pointlessly wacky names, gadgets and situations are trotted out in fast succession. Were it not for the legacy of previous incarnations of Hitchhiker's Guide, this offering might be almost dead in the water or straight to video, but with modern market manipulation (ie $$$) and its impeccable provenance, it will pack cinemas and many will go along with the flow and smile enthusiastically.When I first read The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy I remember to this day how I literally fell off my bed with laughter  and it was the only time this has ever happened to me.

It had to cram everything into less than two hours, while the series could draw everything out, which was good and bad in both cases. I liked the ""new version"" of Marvin, and all the performances were at least decent. I think the only thing I preferred in the original series was the ""two heads"" of Zaphod.

They do a good job of including bits of the book's humor in this screenplay co-written by the author and the British suttle humor prevails throughout the movie. The storyline is kind of an anti-God perspective of the Universe or at least, a who-knows mentality as they try to determine the big answer and question to the world's existence.

52,slokes,Somewhat Slower Than The Speed Of Light,4,3 October 2008,"What ""Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy"" needs is space. Not outer space; that's a given. It needs the kind of space that gives Douglas Adams' cosmically discursive whimsy a chance to grow in the minds of an audience. Like a five-volume trilogy. Or a miniseries. Or a computer game.What it didn't need was a two-hour movie.""Hitchhiker's Guide"" the movie is the proof. A crammed, artificial-feeling creation by committee, it tries to be both a mass-market entertainment and true to the extended Adams family of fans by cramming the story of a man in a bathrobe, one Arthur Dent (Martin Freeman), shuttled beyond the known universe after his home planet of Earth is destroyed to make room for an intergalactic superhighway.""It must be Thursday,"" Arthur muses. ""I could never get the hang of Thursdays.""The film feels like that, too. A shapeless regurgitation of episodes from the first Adams novel, mixed with a couple of annoying new story lines and an uncomfortably conventional, even sentimental romance between Dent and the lead female character, Trillian (Zooey Deschanel), ""Hitchhiker"" never gets the hang of its source material, not surprising given that material's selective appeal. Any story that starts with Earth's wholesale destruction as a source of liberation and hilarity won't play in Peoria.Director Garth Jennings treats Adams with unfailing deference even as he skirts past Adams' work out of simple necessity. If you remember things from reading the books or watching the BBC miniseries, there's a good chance you'll see it referenced in the movie. But Jennings and writer Karey Kirkpatrick never get the material to play on its own power. Instead it seems to settle between two opposite attitudinal poles, that of a giant-headed manic-depressed robot (Alan Rickman's voice, Warwick Davis's body) and the two-headed, maniacally egotistical President of the Galaxy (first-billed Sam Rockwell), spouting dialogue that's likely to infuriate Adams purists and befuddle everyone else. The story moves in fits and jerks as Arthur and his companions planet hop in search of the question to the ultimate answer, which isn't as cool as it sounds.The film does have an impressive look, especially when we meet the nasty Vogons, Muppets cleverly designed by the Jim Henson people to resemble black walking warts with Charles Laughton faces. In their vast clanky metal spaceship I was reminded of the best parts of ""Brazil"". Deschanel is as cute and winsome as ever; those big blues of hers just slay me. The humor still manages to connect about three times out of ten, especially when Bill Nighy shows up as a somewhat dazed fellow who helped design the original planet Earth. (He's very proud of his fjords.)But in the end, you are left feeling more like the robot than anyone else.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
53,TOMNEL,A review from someone who's never read the books.,4,19 September 2007,"This movie makes no sense. Or maybe you have to read the book to understand what's happening, because the movie doesn't give any explanation. The movie starts off very promisingly with a great musical number sung by dolphins leaving the planet. It's a catchy and fun number, and I was hoping that fun and excitement would stick through the rest of the film....it didn't. After about 20 minutes, the movie became so muddled in plot and confusing. The movie was very good at dishing out interesting characters with interesting special effects and puppetry, and it had some good looking sets, but the writing explained none of this and I'm sure all the audience who hadn't read the books was scratching their heads.

And with that comes quite high expectations as the book is a work of art. It is almost impossible to live up to the expectations. And the movie doesn't come close. What in the book is imaginative and just hilarious just gets ridiculous in the movie. Sure, it's entertaining, but most of it is because it reminded me of passages in the book.My guess is that the quite creative but often absurd humor Adams build in Hitchhiker's guide to the Galaxy works well in the book when I set the pace and images to the words. But when I am fed with the images, at a pace not determined by myself, it just gets too much. Also the book can develop ideas and provide much more detail than there is room for in the movie.It is a good cast though. And they handle the quite difficult material well. But the most stellar acting can't elevate the movie to the level of the book.These comments may seem harsh, as the movie is quite entertaining.

Thatws really the only thing I was worried about. Would the creatures be of exceptional quality like say, a Star Wars film, or something forgettable like Wing Commander. Either way, the film didn't disappoint in that area, making the content rather funny in its context.As for the script, it did tend to drag in some spots, but then again, that can be forgiven. Martin Freeman seemed to be a little too over the top in his performance as Arthur Dent, sometimes kicking into gear the old stereotyped performance of he giddy Englishman. Sam Rockwell also got a little tedious at points, but then again, Zooey Deschanel and Mos Def's more subtle performances really did a fine job off-setting these over the top performances.I don't want to reveal too much, but don't listen to the critics, cuz let's face it, they're nothing but a bunch of good-review whores clambering for a bunch of freebies.

The pair meet up with intergalactic president Zaphod Beeblebrox, a fast-talking heel in search of the ancient planet of Magrathea wherein it is rumoured lies the answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe and everything ...Douglas Adams' brilliant, hilarious science-fiction classic has had an odd life-cycle; it was originally a BBC radio-series in 1978, which he then turned into a book and shortly after one of the greatest TV series ever made. He also wrote a film script, which languished for years and has now finally been made, not long after his untimely death. The result is a funny, eye-popping, exciting adaptation of his wonderful idea of a stuffy parochial Englishman adrift in the universe, contrasting a technologically majestic awe-inspiring infinity with officious alien bureaucrats, manic depressive robots and egotistical super-computers. There are so many funny ideas in the story that the film struggles to contain them - cosmic planning permission, death by poetry, improbability physics, customised planet-building, a gun that makes you see someone's point of view, and the Earth as an organic computer-matrix run by mice. Unfortunately, Adams and Karey Kirkpatrick's script suffers in this regard by rushing much of the plot and omitting some great material (such as Vroomfondel and Majikthise, the militant left-wing philosophers). It also adds in new scenes and characters not in the original story - the Vogons feature more prominently, there is a mad prophet called Humma Kavula (Malkovich) and Arthur and Trillian find time to have a romance, all of which I suspect is to make the movie a bit more ordered and palatable. The cast are all good (especially the voice-over actors), and there are some wonderful special-effects, such as Slartibartfast's superfast conveyor-belt transporter. I must confess a prejudice though - whilst this would be a terrific movie by any other standards, check out the 1980 TV series instead, which is a sensational filming of the book and showcases Adams' creative comic genius to perfection. This movie has several nods to it - there is a cameo by actor Jones (who was the original Arthur Dent), the original Marvin robot shows up waiting in a queue, and the theme-music by the Eagles is on the main title.

59,Rob_Taylor,So Long.....and thanks for wasting a couple of hours of my life.,5,12 May 2005,"I wanted to like this film so much. Not because I'm a fan of the books or TV series, but because it was about time Hollywood made a decent ""big screen"" version of a much-loved TV show.Sadly, it was not to be. I suppose, in my more generous moments, that this movie is not awful. But to be sure it's just not that good. Most of what is wrong (and there a lot of things) are relatively minor niggles and irritations. But they combine as a whole to just drag the film down into mediocrity.Real disappointments (against my hopes) were Sam Rockwell and Alan Rickman. Sam was just too frenetic as Zaphod. A kinder person might say he was just putting his own ""spin"" on the character. But to me Zaphod came across as a loud-mouth, untrustworthy imbecile and not as a lovable rogue. Likewise Alan Rickman, whom I was confident would be perfect as Marvin, delivered his lines with either sarcasm or total lack of emotion. Not at all Marvin-like in the least. And don't get me started on the LOOK of Marvin - what the Hell was that about? Cute on a stick. Any cuter and we'd have Ewoks in the movie, too.It seems to me as if the clever dialogue of the series has been cut in favour of a more ""dumbed down"" version. Gone are the passages of foolishness so often a part of Adam's work and in have come simplistic comments. Most of the time this ""cutting"" involves removing all the funny parts of the dialogue, leaving you with nothing left to laugh at other than Rockwell's camera mugging antics. And they get old really quickly.Bright spots in the film? I'd have to think VERY hard to find them. Mos Def gave a capable performance as a black Ford Prefect. And I suppose the effects were good enough. But as a whole, the movie just didn't do it for me. And remember, I don't count myself as a fan.Perhaps part of the problem is that audiences expect more these days. The kind of humour that made Hitchikers (The series) what it was is now long in the tooth. Whilst it will always have its fans, perhaps it is a form of comedy that is past its sell by date (at least, until tastes change again).Still, I suppose it could be worse. The SciFi Channel could have made it it, then it really would have been a disgrace given their record of murdering literary masterpieces. So we should be thankful that it at least wasn't done by them! In summary - not very good.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
60,Matt_Layden,"""Don't Panic...Guide is an acquired taste""",7,2 November 2005,"When Arthur Dent learns that a friend of his is actually an alien with advanced knowledge of Earth's destruction, he is transported off the Earth seconds before it is exploded to make way for a new hyperspace motorway. And as if that's not enough, throw in being wanted by the police, Earth II, an insane electronic encyclopedia, no tea whatsoever, a chronically depressed robot and the search for the meaning of life, and you've got the greatest adventure off Earth.What is the meaning of life, that is the ultimate question that men seek and in Guide, we get an answer. Unfortunately we don't understand the question. Although for now on i'll pay more attention to the number 42.Guide is full of British humour, which to some is not funny and don't get it, but to others is the greatest thing since sliced bread. In guide, it lies somewhere in between. Right from the beginning we see dolphins singing, because they know that the end is coming, and before the earth is destroyed, the dolphins are saved. Funny? Well, I guess it all depends on your sense of humour.In Guide it's the zany off-beat way it presents itself that makes it what it is. Whether the main character become yarn or flowers, you look at the screen with an odd questionable feeling. You don't know what's going on and ask yourself are you actually watching this taking place on screen? The quirky zany off-beat style is littered throughout this film, and if you can appreciate it and like it, then you'll enjoy yourself a lot better, other-wise this film is just a treat for the eyes.The film has lots of unique visuals, I especially liked the team re-creating Earth II. Whether it be filling up the ocean or painting the mountains. All seeing this fly by on a train type creation. This is all happening after you fly through the galaxy on this small little thing.When you have to stay true to the source, you have many people that will be judgemental. Especially since you have to cram so much material into a 110 minute film. I never read the books, so I can't tell you how true to it the film is. I can tell you that there are a lot of inside jokes from the book though, which will either hit or miss, depending on if your a fan or not.Sam Rockwell stole the show as the president of the galaxy. He brings a unique style to every role that he does, and here is no different. When you let Rockwell go over-the-top and have fun with his character, you know he will go to the extreme. In guide we see him having so much fun with the material that you beg for him to be on the screen more.Jennings had the hard task of taking on this immense epic, since this his first outing, I have to say he did a good job. If Guide had an more established director behind the camera, it could have been in the style of Lord of the Rings. But what we get here is just a fun good time, nothing wrong with that either, but when the movie is direct with it's intentions it shouldn't be all fun and games.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
61,begob,Not really,5,24 August 2014,"I didn't laugh once during this. Silly names, bureaucracy-parodies, and underconfident English suburbanites are not my thing. It was amusing, well produced. That's about it.The great lines from the book are included, but the ideas don't really come into play until Slartibartfast gives his view on creating the back-up of the Earth. I was liking it at that stage.The plot line with the menacing priest isn't resolved. And it's not clear why Dent needs both Ford and the girl: sometimes if felt there were too many actors on screen not doing enough. But I think the logical end of that criticism is that Dent and Zaphod should be homosexual. Run away!

I had never read any of Douglas Adams' book, so when I watched the movie I really felt in love with the story. I bought three of the five books after watching the movie, and I just liked even more the series and got to know better the characters. Saddly, many people love or hate this movie. In my case, I just think that is impossible to not laugh with the jokes and the funny scenes of this movie. We have many non sense and crazy situations, as well as cool characters like Marvin and Zaphod.(By the way, Sam Rockwell is perfect as Zaphod! Really he is very charming and crazy as Zaphod would be) For people who enjoyed the movie, I really recommend to read the books.aka ""O Guia dos Mochileiros das Galáxias"" - Brazil",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

How could any other period directors ever try to shoot and screen The Hitch Hikers' Guide To Galaxy without all the modern effects? But the effects are not the crucial part, though they are so perfect that every mouth really should stay open during the viewing. A sarcastic, cynical sense of Adams' humor is preserved in this hilariously entertaining and jaw-dropping movie. What a load of sincere laughs! Just imagine John Malkovich in the role of some horrible monster with no eyes and no body, but man, he looks so funny and so horrid that your sides are ready to split of roaring giggles. The very first scene of dolphins singing and jumping right into the sky leaves you amazed and when you watch the final scenes of the Earth re-creation, you simply freeze in deep awe. But then, no pathos, no pretensions. Everything is so ironic and mercilessly mocking here that you start to live in a totally different world of crooked and twisted humor.

65,mjw2305,The evolution of a great series,8,13 January 2007,"At last the great work of Douglas Adams is given the big screen, big budget makeover and the result is both faithful and satisfying, while managing to be fresh at the same time.In comparison to the wonderfully successful and brilliantly funny BBC TV series there are obviously some differences that may or may not go down well with the fans of the earlier incarnations of this amazing story.Arthur Dent - Played by Martin Freeman, and in my opinion he captures the character perfectly; little has changed in the scope of the character of Arthur, his reasoning, attitude and overall part to play in the story has remained the same. He is still the mild-mannered man who is struggling to come to terms with the recent life changing events.Ford Prefect - Played by Mos Def, has been pushed further into the background than in the TV series, he no longer shares the lead with Arthur Dent, but he is still portrayed in the same vein and he is portrayed quite well.Trillion - Played by Zooey Deschannel, has probably altered the most of all the characters, in the opposite way to Ford, she has been given a larger and far more significant role to play, and she is no longer the slightly annoying, dressed in revealing clothes female addition to the story. Trillion is now a genuinely interesting and pivotal character in the story, and Zooey Deschannel portrays her brilliantly.Zaphod Beeblebrox - Played by Sam Rockwell, has had a serious makeover that i feel could have been better than is it, however Rockwell does play the role with the correct amount of lunacy to capture the character convincingly.Marvin - Played by Warwick David and Alan Rickman (Voice) was always one of my favourite characters, and was the one i feared i wouldn't like in this incarnation. I'm so glad to that i was wrong, Marvin's complete shape shift adds real expression the manically depressed robot, and for me he steals the show.The Guide itself - Voiced by Stephen Fry, one word, perfect.And finally - Slartibartfast - Played by Bill Nighy, and thankfully he injects his usual dry humour into the role, and surpasses the original incarnation with ease.So how does this film compare to the stories that preceded it? Well, obviously it is far more impressive visually, the vast workshop on Magrethia is quite simply awesome and beautiful to see on the big screen, the vogons are clearly more convincing to look at and the destruction of the Earth is a far superior scene in this movie. The new character of Humma Kavula is a great addition, and is brilliantly brought to life by the great John Malkovich and the screenplay has enough new material to feel like a different experience, without straying too far from the TV series.All in all i still prefer the BBC series, but only because i grew up with it and its hard to separate that from my mind when watching this movie. It's still a great film and i for one was pleasantly surprised that is hasn't been lost in translation; it has simply evolved, and i can't wait for the sequel - please - please - please 8/10",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
66,dunmore_ego,"Mining the Diary, Missing the Madman",6,20 January 2007,"Douglas Adams did not live to see his wondrous literary creation, *The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy*, made into this feature film. Maybe that's fortunate.Each individual component of this movie is well done, from Garth Jennings' direction, to the astoundingly creative set design (all the good guys sport spherical décor, the bad guys, cubical) and creature visualizations (the Vogons are magnificently vile prosthetic puppets), to the performances (from creatures and humans alike), to the creation of the on-screen Hitchhiker's Guide entries, to the artful compressing of Adams' sprawling opus into a 109 minute movie. Yet somehow, the end result of all these superior elements comes out as flollopy as a mattress from the swamps of Squornshellous Zeta.Eternally-vexed Arthur Dent (Martin Freeman of Ricky Gervais' *The Office*) is hitch-hiked off Earth by Ford Prefect (Mos Def) just before it is vaporized by Vogons to make way for a hyperspace freeway. So begins Arthur's trek through the galaxy in the company of opportunist Ford, intergalactic rogue and President of the Galaxy, Zaphod Beeblebrox (Sam Rockwell) and flighty Earth girl, Trillian (Zooey Deschanel), attended by ""paranoid android,"" Marvin (voiced by Alan Rickman).Approaching a movie with this level of cult status is slippery from the outset. The screenplay issues from the demented pen of Adams himself, so cultists have little to complain about, though whether his second draft should have been the FINAL one  his death getting in the way  is definitely a matter for contention. Objectively, this enterprise is miles above the British television series  for production value, better acting and snappier writing  but fails in conveying a sense of empathy, because we do not get to live with these characters through weekly adventures.The actual Guide is smartly purveyed as a computer  even in our modern day, we call laptops ""notebooks""  and there are seemingly endless elements of Adams' book incorporated into the Guide and the movie itself. The more obsessive you are, the deeper into the movie you'll fall.At film's end, when the Improbability Drive turns the spaceship into various objects  as our intrepid adventurers seek the Restaurant at the End of the Universe  Adams' face is the last image we see as the space cyclorama fades to black. We can only hope he would have been proud of the effort.And the question remains: With the movie failing to cow the competition enough to warrant funding for a big-budget followup, how many inferior sequels will be churned out to court the cultist fanboy dollar? The answer may be as unimportant as Slartibartfast's name.Then again, the answer may just be 42.(Movie Maniacs, visit: poffysmoviemania.com)",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
67,pyrocitor,Remember that humans are only the third most intelligent species on the planet,10,17 May 2005,"For all fans of the series of novels by Douglas Adams - DON'T PANIC. For the Hitchhiker's books series (the ""trilogy of five""...if that makes any sense to you, safe to say that both the novels and movie are perfect for you) have received a loving and careful recreation on the big screen. The story, set almost entirely on strange alien planets, also benefits from recent advancements in computer animation technologies, bringing the series to life in far more colour and energy than the 80's television show was ever capable of. This is not to say that the 80's show was bad - just that this Hitchhikers succeeds more in capturing the energy and hilarity of the novels.Debut director Garth Jennings shows his careful, yet whimsical influence here, as he faithfully recreates the worlds designed in Adams' books, but adds his own little tweaks here and there. (the film receives a kickstart from a group of dolphins singing ""So long, and thanks for all the fish"", such an excellent song that it will be a severe shame if it is snubbed at next year's Oscars) Perhaps most importantly, Jennings also manages to perfectly capture Adams' wacky sense of off-the-wall humour - very much in the style of Monty Python, another group of British comedians. Martin Freeman seems to have been born to play bumbling everyman Arthur Dent, who is more than a little surprised when he finds that both his house, and later his planet, have both been demolished in the same day... and both to make way for two entirely separate bypasses. He is dragged bewilderedly by his friend Ford Prefect, (Mos Def) who until this day he had actually believed had come from the same planet as he, into hitchhiking onto a passing by alien ship. For Arthur, the whole concept of having lost his home, having his planet destroyed, and finding out that his closest friend is, in fact, not from the same planet as he, the day has been stressful enough. But his situation does not get any easier, in fact it grows far more chaotic upon the arrival of Zaphod Beeblebrox (Sam Rockwell), fugitive president of the Galaxy who is searching for the ultimate question of Life, the Universe, and Everything. If that wasn't enough, Tricia McMillan (Zooey Deschantel), the second and only other human survivor of Earth's destruction, and whom coincidentally Arthur happened to have a bit of a crush on, has tagged along with Zaphod in search of adventure.The cast assembled to bring life to the legendary characters is wonderful, with excellent performances all around. It also helps that none of the stars are huge Hollywood names, allowing the illusion of recreation to be complete, and let us know them as their characters, and not, say, as Jim Carrey. (who was originally considered for the role of Ford Prefect) All of the cast turn out terrific performances, and manage to stay faithful to the book characters. Mos Def may be an obscure choice for the part (he doesn't exactly come from the same acting style as Jim Carrey) but he makes a wonderful Ford Prefect, perfectly capturing Ford's constant awkwardness, never really knowing how to fit in, as well as a tremendously funny array of strange screeches and facial expressions at the least likely of times. Sam Rockwell is hilariously over the top, the perfect Zaphod Beeblebrox, portraying the president of the Galaxy as a brain dead rocker type. And Zooey Deschantel is an inspired choice to play Tricia, wonderfully showing her quirky and yet oddly charming nature.It doesn't seem like much of a surprise to see that most of the faults in the Hitchhiker's movie are elements not written by Douglas Adams. The addition of a love triangle between Arthur, Zaphod and Tricia seems so horribly formulaic that it puts a slight damper on the brilliance of the rest of the story. But, as for the rest, it's hard to imagine the spirit of the novels being captured in such a witty and wonderfully strange fashion. It's true that some of the humour may prove too obscure for those who haven't read the novels, but don't let that deter you from seeing this wonderfully unique, imaginative and sidesplittingly funny film - the only place you will manage to find that the answer to Life, the Universe and Everything is... 42. -9.5/10",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
68,Cosmoeticadotcom,Solid,6,19 September 2008,"The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy is one of those films that seems a lot better if one has not read the source material it's based upon- in this case the series of Hitchhiker books by Douglas Adams, the BBC radio shows, or the 1970s BBC television series of the same name. This was manifest immediately to me, as one who'd seen the repeats of the TV show on PBS, but never read the books. In just briefly skimming the online critical consensus this seems confirmed, for rarely does a film elicit such widely divergent reactions. Those critics who came to this film fresh invariably thought it was very good, while those with prior Hitchhiker bonafides thought this new version, by first time director Garth Jennings, who made his name in music videos, was horrible. Oddly, even though I fall into the latter camp, I thought it was a mildly amusing film, in the tradition of Mel Brooks' Spaceballs, and it was scripted by Karey Kirkpatrick, who wrote the delightful claymation comedy Chicken Run, with help from Adams, before he died in 2000. This enjoyment I felt may have been due to the fact that although I enjoyed the old BBC series it's been at least twenty years since I saw the show.The problem with the film is not really the film's problem, but that the books have such a devoted cult following that even the slightest deviations from the canon seem to be taken personally by fans and critics alike, even though all basic tales must adapt to whatever medium they are in. As long as they capture the essence of the work, that's all that is required. And the essence is a work of humor somewhere between Jonathan Swift and Kurt Vonnegut. Overall, even if one is not too thrilled with the film, the DVD extras make the effort a little more worthwhile. This zeitgeist may explain the many cameos in the film, by the likes of Jason Schwartzman and John Malkovich, although they are really given nothing to work with. Yet, Slartibartfast's philosophy, 'I'd rather be happy than right,' is the sort that, if applied to the film's many disappointed cultist detractors, is hard not to find some resonance with, even if, like him, real happiness has not been reached. Somehow, though, I think Douglas Adams would find their circumstance a hoot.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
69,Philby-3,"OK for Newbies, fans stay away",5,7 May 2005,"Anyone who has heard the 1979 radio series, read the books or seen the 1981 TV series need not bother with this truncated and dumbed-down version of one of the late 20th century's most eclectic and amusing bits of Sci-Fi. Someone who hasn't however will probably find it all good fun, with some strong performances, spectacular visuals and engaging monsters all delivered at a cracking pace.There is no point on dwelling on the differences in the plot, but the scriptwriters, who included Douglas Adams, must take the blame for murdering most of the best lines. Down here in Sydney we got a version that lasted barely 100 minutes (the TV version was 180 minutes) so no doubt that cramped the writers' style but a lot of the omissions and changes made little sense. There is a lot more of the Vogons, including a visit to their planet, and Magrathea, the planet-building planet is much more spectacular (and Bill Nighy's Slartibartfast much more droll). The décor inside the stolen space ship is rather nicer, and I liked the Dolphin chorus at the start. The Magratheans' warning hologram is none other than Simon Jones, the TV Arthur Dent and the original Marvin the cosmically depressed android pops up in a Vogon office queue. This gave rise to one new funny line from Arthur: ""I'm English. I know how to queue."" But we never actually make it to the restaurant at the end of the Universe.There really isn't much wrong with any of the principal performances. Martin Freeman is a little less hoity-toighty than Simon Jones in the TV version but shares the same deep outrage at what the Universe has conspired to do to him. Mos Def is perfectly fine as Ford Prefect (and how he chose the name is better explained) and I didn't mind Sam Rockwell as Zaphod, who is a tiresome character anyway. Zooey Deschanel is an attractive Trillian, who has a bigger part here. In the more minor roles John Malkovich is wasted as pastor of the Church of the Holy Sneeze (in fact his whole appearance is redundant) but Bill Nighy exercises all his quirky charm to give us a warm and likable Slartibartfast. Stephen Fry's narration is as smooth as silk though much of the narration seems to have finished up on the cutting room floor.The producers, Touchstone, are a division of Disney, and while that is not a guarantee of mindless sugary entertainment, it often works out that way. This movie is by no means a complete disaster but in comparison with other versions of the Hitchhiker opus it is an anemic and listless one, despite the efforts of the energetic Gareth Jennings as director. If you are new to the Hitchhiker it will do you no harm, but if you are a fan it will be a source of exasperation.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
70,film-critic,I know a great Restaurant at the End of the Universe.,9,17 May 2005,"""42"" Growing up with these books clenched tightly to my side, I walked into this film with some very high expectations. I had not seen the BBC mini-series or heard the radio show, all I knew was the countless hours that I spent reading, and re-reading, the books. I had visions in my mind on how it would have to look, and expectations that I wasn't sure Hollywood was going to be able to capture. Well, I am here to say that I was very impressed and very pleased with this theatrical release. While I do believe that it was aimed towards the wrong audience, the overall feel, philosophy, and sense of adventure were captured completely from Adams' written page. The characters best embodied the ones that I had in my mind, while Henson's work on the creatures was better than any CGI used today. I guess I grew up with Henson's darker side, and to see it come back in this film only fueled my excitement. The actors perfectly fit their roles while keeping the emotion and thought still alive. This was a bold creation that American audiences hated because it forced the common theatergoer to think, which is unheard of in most of today's cinematic adventures. Either way, this was a great start to Hollywood's infamous summer.I must first give credit to director Garth Jennings for creating such a vibrant film. While I do believe that someone else (Spike Jonez) would have done a decent job, Jennings proved that he could handle this delicate picture. This is not your typical sci-fi treat, but instead a philosophy course wrapped in the delectable flakiness of science fiction. Jennings kept the film grounded, while still shooting us off into distant worlds and powerful creations. He led our actors deep within the heart of this cult classic, and never let them run wild. He kept the film British (which I worried we, as Americans, would transform it into this American picture), and really embodied the style. He never let the audience go. There was always something happening, something for us to explore, and new thoughts to implant into our minds. You cannot walk away from the book without seeing the world differently, and Jennings knew that and brought that directly to the screen. I cannot praise Jennings enough for being true to the books as well as Adams' vision. He did not stagger and go the Hollywood circle, which I can only say ""thank you"".Instead of continuing my constant praise of this film, which you can check every element that you can think of, I think I am going to conclude this with the final paragraph of the book. I am just so overwhelmed by the power of the film that I have to re-read the story again (for the millionth time). So for all of you non-readers out there, enjoy, and oh  GO SEE THIS FILM!!! Chapter 35 That night, as the Heart of Gold was busy putting a few light-years between itself and the Horsehead Nebula, Zaphod lounged under the small palm tree on the bridge trying to ban his brain into shape with massive Pan Galactic Gargle Blasters; Ford and Trillian sat in a corner discussing life and matters arising from it; and Arthur took to his bed to flip through Ford's copy of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. Since he was going to have to live in the place, he reasoned, he'd better start finding out something about it.He came across this entry.It said: ""The History of every major Galactic Civilization tends to pass through three distinct and recognizable phases, those of Survival, Inquiry, and Sophistication, otherwise known as the How, Why, and Where phases. For instance, the first phase is characterized by the question How can we eat? The second by the question Why do we eat? And the third by the question Where shall we have lunch?"" He got no further before the ship's intercom buzzed into life.""Hey, Earthman? You hungry, kid?"" said Zaphod's voice.""Er, well, yes, a little peckish, I suppose,"" said Arthur.""Okay, baby, hold tight,"" said Zaphod. ""We'll take in a quick bite at the Restaurant at the End of the Universe."" Grade: ***** out of *****",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
71,sarastro7,The problems: Pacing. Timing.,7,24 May 2005,"This movie probably is 95% as it would have been, had Douglas Adams still been alive to finalize it. And yet, this big-budget motion picture (my rating: 7) is inferior to the British low-budget TV series (my rating: 8). I am not furious about this, though, because, let's face it, we're dealing with one individual's vision and humor, and this has to be treated by a bunch of committees to be fit into a big-time American movie. A thousand things can and will go wrong.I actually liked virtually all the new material (Douglas Adams's own, I'm convinced). The wholesome structure of the movie was perfectly okay with me. The addition of the bureaucratic dimension to galactic civilization (which follows logically from the books!), where Zaphod had inadvertently ordered the destruction of the Earth worked very well. I liked the ending. I thought it fit like a glove into the spirit of the books.I also liked Trillian. A lot. Despite being American (and sounding like it), she managed to be both cute, quirky and intelligent. Much, much closer to the character in the book than Sandra Dickinson's Trillian in the TV series. She was missing the brown eyes, though - if there's one thing I remember about Trillian from the books, it's that she's supposed to have ""ridiculously brown eyes"". That's obviously part of the reason she makes such an impression on Arthur - but that's the book.Arthur, in the movie, was not bad, either. A younger, less confused (but more nerdy) version than Simon Jones' Arthur in the TV series. The TV Arthur was funnier and cartoonier, but the movie Arthur was more likable, and fit better into the movie's story. Still, I don't find myself recalling dozens of funny Arthur moments with the movie, as I do with the TV series. Maybe because Arthur and Trillian were treated more like real people in the movie. Which is one of the things that give the movie its own flavor, which is alright.Zaphod is actually extremely good. He's well-acted and functions very well - he's actually funny. Even the double-head thing surprisingly works completely. Great!The movie has different morals from the books. In the movie, Zaphod's good-for-nothing lifestyle is judged and he's found guilty of being a galaxy-class dick. Which, commendably, is also how Sam Rockwell plays him. An irresponsible and incorrigible male chauvinist who deserves to be exposed as the conman he is. In the books, this aspect of his character was treated comically, and he got away with it, because it was all in good fun. Not so in the movie. Is this better than the books? No. Worse? No. Different - yes. Cool.Marvin, too, was okay. He could have been better; in fact, in the trailer, I didn't like his design (the huge head in particular). But in the movie, when in his first scene he says, ""I have an exceptionally large mind"", I thought it worked entirely well. Brain the size - and now also shape - of a planet, indeed!The triangle thing between Arthur, Trillian and Zaphod is acceptable. It adds a love story to the movie, and this is alright. This dimension was always downplayed before, but sort of implicit in the book. One complaint: In the movie, ""Trillian"" is apparently Zaphod's nickname for Tricia MacMillan, and she apparently leaves this name behind when she ends up with Arthur, reverting to Tricia. My understanding from the books was always that ""Trillian"" was a name she'd chosen for herself, because it was more exotic and exciting and sci-fi like (she is, after all, an astrophysicist with a thirst for cosmic adventure!). It's the defining name of her character, after all - so I thought it was a mistake to have it be Zaphod's invention and discard it.A major thing that just did not quite work was Mos Def's Ford Prefect. He simply wasn't quirky enough. Ford is supposed to be enthusiastic and zany, but sometimes a little distant, because he hasn't learned all the mannerisms of Earthlings and doesn't always have complete situational awareness. However, Mos Def's Ford came across simply as absent-minded and indifferent rather than someone who was simply overlooking certain obvious-to-the-rest-of-us details. The quirky personality he's supposed to have just never materialized, which contributed to the movie's not really being very funny.Which brings us to the One Big Thing that was wrong with the movie - disastrous pacing and timing. The jokes were not given time to sink in, the longer-running ones were cut short in the most insensitive manner, and the delivery of many of them was dangerously close to bleh. The book is full of pensive humor which, while hilarious when you think about it, is not necessarily laugh-out-loud funny. In the movie, there is no time to be pensive. The points of the jokes are amputated, and before the audience can ""get it"", we're on to something else. It was as if the director or editor tried to treat the jokes like slapstick. Which they most certainly are not. The fault must lie somewhere in post-production. Some pivotal people simply did not realize what kind of humor they were dealing with.Instead of a Douglas Adams movie, we have a forced and cramped and over-eager Terry Prachett movie.Read the books instead. Heck, read the comic books; DC Comics has produced absolutely excellent comic book versions of the first three books. These, too, are much better than this movie. The definitive movie version has yet to be made.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

Zaphod has some unfinished business with Humma Kavula (his previous political opponent), which causes him to search out Deep Thought and ask for a particular gun that Humma demands. While with Deep Thought, we get entangled with the quest for the question to life, the universe, and everything. Deep Thought knows the answer (42), but not the question. Zaphod, Arthur, and Trillian wrangle about why she left Earth (and Arthur) with Zaphod, and about who ordered Earth to be destroyed. The clinically depressed robot Marvin laments all the pieces.Some issues are resolved in this film. The book that spawned the film was only the first in a series, after all. When Arthur meets Slartibartfast (played brilliantly by Bill Nighy), the third act takes off. Slartibartfast works for a concern that builds planets. Perhaps all this could be put back together, but will it?This is an odd duck. The beginning was so slow it almost demanded yawns. However, the building of context through the film led to a brilliant and dense comedic impact in the last 20 minutes. The start, though, was so bad that the wife and I nearly abandoned the film to watch, well, anything else. I am glad to have stuck with it, but would not watch it again.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
73,mentalcritic,A spectacular disappointment,2,3 May 2005,"""...but to borrow my analogy about music and pop, if HGGTTG were a universe, this film would be a speck of dust on the tiniest moon of the tiniest planet...""In many ways, The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy was like Verhoeven's film adaptation of StarShip Troopers. It trusted that the audience were smart enough to get the joke on their own. Which is why this film adaptation, which I will refer to from this point as the Hitchhiker's Little Bucket, or HLB to be concise and to differentiate, is such a monumental failure. This is not Douglas Adams' HHGTTG. Sure, his name is in the credits, but the fact that Zaphod Beeblebrox's second head (which the film makes no attempt to inform the audience was added after his visit to Earth) comes out of his neck like a jack in the box makes it obvious that Adams' contribution to the final shooting script was very, very, very small.In fact, I would not be in the least bit surprised to learn that aside from this minor detail, which was obviously subject to a clumsy rewrite in one memorable moment, Adams' only contributions to the script were the pieces taken from his radio play. Speaking of which, one could have easily fit his entire radio play into a three hour film and had space to spare. Hell, if they wanted to end it on a real cliffhanger and left room for the sequel they were obviously intending, they could have fit the first four episodes into a two-hour film.And still had space to spare.By far the most obvious sign that the script was rewritten is when Humma Kavula, a character obviously added solely to motivate a useless quest that was unnecessarily added to the story for who knows what reason, relieves Zaphod of his second head. As written in the novel adaptation of the radio play (are you still with me?), Zaphod's second head basically grew out of his shoulder, like a clumsy experimental surgery. I wonder, exactly, whether the screenwriters intended to explain how it was possible to remove one head that sat on top of another without damaging that other head, or whether this was just a piece that was written without consideration to all the other pieces.Of course, with Zaphod's second head being held hostage, the fact that the group goes to Milliways without even bothering to try to retrieve it kind of makes the whole thing redundant. And in making the head issue redundant, we also make the whole attempt to retrieve the point of view gun from Magrathea redundant. By making the point of view gun redundant, we also make one sketch where the Vogon army is reduced to a quivering wreck by Marvin using said gun on them redundant. And so on.It isn't just the pieces where the film diverges from the radio play or the novels that causes it to fail, either. The dialogues from the radio play that get into the film are so clipped that they lose any and all impact. Arthur's response to the On Display rebuttal, in fact pretty much the entire On Display bit, are missing. The whole moment with Ford and Arthur trying to worm their way out of being tossed out of the airlock by telling the Vogon captain how good they thought his poetry was makes no sense because it is cut by nine tenths. Obviously, the individuals responsible for the screenplay had never heard the saying that when you read half the sentence, you lose all the meaning.Moments such as when we learn that Zaphod has been on Earth, and that Arthur knows who he is, are made redundant, repeated several times, and scattered about the story, without the slightest impact or result. The sequence with the mice suddenly deciding they need Arthur's brain in order to finish their experiment, and the sudden plot crowbar to undo the demolition of the Earth that soon follows, is an example of the take-no-risk mentality that cripples Hollywood at its very worst. What is most ironic about this adaptation is that if Douglas Adams had lived to see the kind of Hollywood that had decided it was going to finally get around to adapting his work, he would have pulled the plug and advised those nearest to him to never consider another offer from a Hollywood studio.When I recall what I saw this evening, and compare it with all the possibilities that an adaptation of Douglas Adams' magnum opus had, I have little choice but to give HLB a two out of ten. It is not even bad enough to warrant the so-bad-it-is-good score of one. Instead, it tries so very hard, and fails so very utterly, that it is stuck firmly in no man's land. Don't let those who have been conditioned to accept crap fool you. This is just another case of Hollywood having a big laugh at the expense of the literate.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
74,ElijahCSkuggs,I love depressed robots.,8,13 January 2008,"It's really stunning how many people hate this film. They HAVE to be comparing it to the book/series etc. I personally haven't read the book or watched any TV show or movie, so I went into this movie with an open-mind. I first saw this film when it came out a couple years ago and I enjoyed it. It was silly, had non-stop weird British humor, had fantastic sets, and great imagination. And after watching just last night, my opinion hasn't changed in the slightest bit. The movie still delivered on each of those things, and I was actually very content with it, even more so than when I saw it in the theater. The movie does have a couple lulls, and a couple characters do kind of wear out their welcome, but overall, the movie moves at such a high pace and delivers so much creativity that I can't help but be entertained by it. I feel sorry for the people who hate this movie because they can't help comparing this to the other Hitchhiker materials. Just be ready for lots of British humor. 7.5 outta 10",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
75,Victor Field,This has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move. But it could have been worse.,6,8 May 2005,"""The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"" was a classic radio series, though I first came across it in book form (I also bought the published radio scripts). Since Douglas Adams's books differ so colossally from his radio scripts (in the books Arthur Dent finds out that the destruction of Earth was all an illusion and learns to fly...) it's not fair to knock the movie on the grounds that it doesn't stay closely to the source. Nor is it fair to complain, as some have done, that my favourite lines aren't in the movie (you can't expect everything to make it into a movie version).Knocking it on the grounds of, ironically, never really going anywhere is another matter. The bones of the project are there, and it's not nearly as bad as the last two ""Star Wars"" movies, but at the same time it never comes together - it's a bit of a mess, with the big musical number from the dolphins not adding that much to the movie, and an ill-advised decision to give the Vogons a little too much time on screen. Speaking of ill-advised, the cast is wildly uneven; Martin Freeman is fine as Arthur and Zooey Deschanel is appealing as Trillian (a character much changed from the original), but Mos Def is mos def not right as Ford Prefect, and Sam Rockwell's Zaphod Beeblebrox is just... ugh. (This is also a problem with some of the voices; Bill Bailey as the missile-turned-sperm-whale yes, Helen Mirren as Deep Thought no, Stephen Fry as the Guide definitely no.) And what is John Malkovich doing here? And why is he made up to look like Elton John?The movie seems to want to be all things to all people, but ends up falling between stools - it's not adventurous enough, it's not funny enough, it's not inspiring enough... basically, it's just not enough. It's watchable, but in the end you just want to read the books or listen to the radio show again (or see ""GalaxyQuest"" if you're in the mood for a genuinely witty science fiction movie with Alan Rickman); the feeling of adventure and comedy you truly get from them is missing here.Mind you, it's still better than ""Mostly Harmless.""",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
76,Karl Self,Message To Upset Fanboys,9,2 July 2008,"So the average IMDb'er thinks this is a mediocre to bad movie, eh? Oh dearie me. I can just about see them before my mental eye: how they're reading the five-volume trilogy when they're sixteen, listening to the BBC radio series on audiotape when they're seventeen and watching the BBC TV series when they're thirty-seven (when they've finally managed to get it on eBay) in their fuggy little bedrooms on a hot summer day, while some Southron poolcleaning jock is savagely shagging the girls of their dreams, girlfriends and wives behind their backs. My life story, incidentally, but I digress. And then someone goes and makes a movie about THEIR private sacred cult underground classic, and it's with proper special effects and now and not some cheap off-coloured British TV production in the 1970ies which they can pass off as intellectual underground cult classic. Actually, just talking about it makes me want to rate this blasphemy on celluloid MINUS Forty-TWO -- geddit?! But hold your horses, this is not a bad movie at all. I though it was funny, well made and reasonably close to the book. It then suddenly turns bad at exactly 1h30m when Arthur declares his undying love to Trillian which she gooey-eyedly accepts (pretty unlikely even at full improbability drive considering that she's lovely and he looks like Michael Moore's grandma), then there is a nasty sound created by Douglas Adams rotating at high speed in his grave, and luckily the movie then ends abruptly only five minutes later. Five bad minutes out of a 95-minute movie, that's an 8 rating in my book. But I've made it a nine to priss off the fanboys.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
77,gftbiloxi,Amusing Riff On A Largely Unfilmable Book,8,12 June 2007,"Some novels cannot be filmed, and Douglas Adam's THE HITCHHIKER'S GUIDE TO THE GALAXY and its several sequels is a prime example. The plot, such as it is, is non-traditional--but more significantly, the brilliance of the novel is not so much what it is about as how it is written. And that, as screen adapters of everything from THE GREAT GATSBY to CATCH-22 will tell you, isn't something that translates to film.No, Adam's novel cannot be filmed and it really is as simple as that. Once you accept this, stop expecting the film to duplicate the novel, and take it for what it is--a riff on Adam's ideas rather than a bona fide adaptation--the 2005 HITCHERHIKER'S GUIDE is really quite a lot of fun.The plot is episodic to the point of intergalactic buckshot. Arthur Dent (Martin Freeman) is an ordinary Englishman without great aspirations or indeed without an interesting life, at least until the world comes to an end and he finds himself hitching a ride on a space ship for parts unknown courtesy of alien Ford Prefect (Mos Def.) Along the way there will everything from bureaucratic and poetry-reading Vogons, the two-faced (literally) president of the galaxy, a depressed robot with a bi-polar disorder, evil preachers from outer space, and, er, mice.The film looks sharp in its mixture of real-time puppets and the inevitable CGI effects, the cast is attractive, and at its best HITCHHIKER'S GUIDE has an almost Monty Python sensibility. When it works it all goes like a house afire; when it doesn't it is at least visually entertaining. Purists will argue almost every aspect of the film, and truly nothing can nor should supplant the novel itself, but taken on its own merits the film is unexpectedly amusing. A great film that will last through ages? No--but quite a bit a fun just the same.GFT, Amazon Reviewer",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
78,dglink,Always Be Properly Dressed in Case the World Ends,7,29 April 2005,"Otherwise, you could find yourself wandering the universe in pink striped jammies and a ratty green bathrobe. This is the sartorial condition in which Arthur Dent finds himself when he is saved at the last minute from Earth's demolition at the hands of an intergalactic road crew. Dressed in his night clothes throughout the film, Martin Freemen as Dent forms part of a motley gang of other improbable wanderers on a road trip across the galaxy. The group includes the president of the galaxy, who has two heads; a fellow earth survivor on whom Dent has a crush; and Dent's alien rescuer who has a thing about towels. The film is droll and amusing much of the time, with credit going to the befuddled Freeman, a pasty-faced Everyman with bags under his eyes and a permanent lost expression on his face. Kudos also go to Alan Rickman as a personality-challenged robot and to Stephen Fry's narration. However, the humor and pacing may reflect British tastes more than American. Dent's quest for a cup of tea and his innate ability to queue may not register equally on both sides of the Atlantic. Nevertheless, the film has a lot going for it and will reward those who stick with it through the slow parts. The special effects strike a good balance between state of the art and low-budget tacky, both used appropriately in context. The opening song and intro about dolphins were amusing, although the sound quality, which could be theater-specific, made it difficult to understand. The alien creatures, like the special effects, are wonderful and run the gamut from convincing to sock puppets, again all are used appropriately within the logic of the film.""The Hitchhiker's Guide"" is sometimes zany, sometimes funny, and occasionally flat. There are more smiles than laughs. As a fan of Martin Freeman from ""The Office"" and having enjoyed the book many years ago, I really wanted to love the movie more than I actually did. Perhaps the film needed the genius of the Monty Python guys to infuse this with more zip, although some of the movie does seem to have been inspired by Python antics, and bits from ""The Meaning of Life"" kept popping into my mind as I was watching. While ""Hitchhiker's Guide"" is far from a misfire, the movie ultimately disappoints despite the creativity and talent lavished upon it. A final word of advice: as with Python films, stay through the end credits, there is a funny bit that will be lost to those who leave the theater early.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

80,cultfilmfan,The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy,7,1 May 2005,"The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy, is based on the book of the same name by Douglas Adams (who also wrote the film's screenplay before he passed away). The film is about a man named Arthur Dent, who finds a construction crew outside waiting to bulldoze down his house to make way for a highway. Arthur's friend Ford Prefect, comes along and tells Arthur that the world is about to be destroyed in a few minutes. Ford, is right and just as the Earth is about to be destroyed he and Arthur hitch a ride on a passing alien spacecraft. While in space Arthur, and Ford experience many adventures and different situations. They also meet a goofy and at the same time clueless president of outer space named Zaphod Beeblebrox and another Earthling named Trillian, who Arthur remembers from Earth. They are also accompanied by a manic depressive robot named Marvin, on their many different and wacky adventures. The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy, has good direction, a good script, good comedic performances by everyone involved, good original music, good cinematography, good film editing, good production design, good art direction, set direction and good visual effects. At first I couldn't get into this movie and I waited awhile to get used to it because of it's pace but I did eventually get into the movie and I did enjoy it. There are some things I didn't totally understand and in a way it is a complicated movie and I'm sure a lot of the things I didn't understand where in jokes from the book that you would have had to have read the book to understand. Besides starting out slow and being a little muddled and confusing at times the film is very unique and clever, is well made and well acted and after you get used to the dull tone of the film it is very entertaining. I have however read that many fans of the book have been disappointed by the film though because it misses on a lot of it's humour.

Old gits like myself who loved one of the various incarnations (book, radio, TV) tend to be a bit harsher than people who are new to the experience.Personally I only saw hhgttg on TV, and I think the movie experience is a good adaptation. Those who scoff at parts being cut back or cut altogether have got to realise that movies can't go on for 6 hours plus. Having seen the TV series again recently much of the dialogue is taken straight from the TV series. The movie isn't without flaws and the running time is just about ideal. A couple of the leading performances could have been better, but the two best performances are from the actors that don't appear on screen. Stephen Fry and Alan Rickman were both well cast as the book and Marvin the robot respectively. Well worth a couple of hours of your life.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

It's gonna be a disaster and nobody's gonna watch it, neither the blockbuster addicts nor the stricter audiences.Yeah, they have worked hard and there's no doubt the débutant Garth Jennings put tons of enthusiasm in this project, but it's just that isn't funny at all, and it's so goddamn boring...

84,itamarscomix,Delivers,7,24 May 2005,"Well, what did you expect, people? Friggin' Citizen Kane? This is the Hitchhiker's Guide. Of course it's idiotic, illogical, superficial, fragmented and full of holes. No, this is not a masterpiece, but it delivers just what it needs to, and it's as good as it could ever be. The Hitchhiker's Guide is a hilariously funny, evilly sarcastic, impossibly anarchistic piece of satire. It's not a hundred percent true to the source material, either, of course - naturally, that would be impossible. Yes, seventy percent of the jokes have been cut, but what do you expect? Would you really prefer to have a five-film series, one for each book in the saga? From a purist's point of view maybe that would be ideal, but again, impossible. Reread the books and you will find that each one contains hardy twenty minutes of plot and hundreds of jokes and observations. In that form, the Hitchhiker's Guide could make for fantastic prose and, maybe, potentially great stand-up, but very, very boring cinema. The script only left a handful of the observations and increases the part of romance and adventure, as would be only natural to do, and it did it in the best possible way and without hurting the spirit and the style of the origin - the script was co-written by Mr. Adams himself, and it shows.Kudos on the production. The Hitchhiker's Guide is a perfect British-American cooperation - namely, a British looking film with an American looking production, which gives us the best of both worlds. The highly-British, almost Monty-Pythonesque feel of the source material is kept, yet the production looks much more professional than any other British film. Jim Henson's workshop (on the American side) provided the wonderful looking creatures, and the Guide segments are escorted by absolutely brilliant animation sequences. The cast is also a great American-British combination. Martin Freeman (of the hit BBC series 'The Office') is the perfect Arthur Dent, as averagely British as one can possibly be; and despite my (and many other fans') initial skepticism, Mos Def also turns in a respectable Ford Prefect - Do remember that descriptions of Ford were hardly given in the books, and it cannot be assumed that he is white any more than it can be assumed that he is black. The aliens, though, are American - and they're as weird, unearthly and vulgar as Americans must really seem to British. Sam Rockwell completely steals the show as a fantastic Zaphod Beeblebrox, in a performance that may be the best of his career; and let's not forget the terrific cameo by John Malkovich, as a character that was not in the books but was created by Adams himself especially for the film. Finally, I cannot help but mention the great Alan Rickman, picture perfect as Marvin the Paranoid Android (it was either him or John Cleese).Don't Panic! The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is not half as bad as some of these reviews will have you think, it's a film that's funny and enjoyable from beginning to end, but don't take it too seriously or you might get disappointed. If you're a fan of the books, I'm sure you'll enjoy it. If you never read them, just one piece of advice - don't try to make sense of the plot or the science, because they make no sense. Just take it for what it is, and enjoy the ride.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
85,TheNorthernMonkee,"well made and entertaining, but ultimately forgettable",7,28 April 2005,"SPOILERS Years in the making, ""The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"" has finally arrived on the big screen. Written by comedy genius Douglas Adams what feels like an eternity ago, the book has been through countless incarnations before eventually being made into this film, a few years after his death. This untimely death is perhaps especially crucial since Adams would have loved what they've done with his work. Using Adams' script, director Garth Jennings and his superb cast have created a relatively faithful, although with the occasional original part, adaptation. Unfortunately however, despite the skill of the project and some hilarious moments, the vast majority feels weak and forgettable.Arthur Dent (Martin Freeman) doesn't quite get Thursdays. This Thursday in particular, things get off to a bad start when his house is about to be knocked down. As his friend Ford Prefect (Mos Def) thinks however, it doesn't really matter as so is the Earth. With Earth destroyed to make way for an Intergalactic Bypass, Arthur finds himself exploring the galaxy with Ford, an irritating President (Sam Rockwell), a girl he met at a party one night (Zooey Deschanel) and a depressed robot (Alan Rickman). All Arthur wants however is a cup of tea.First and foremost, the casting of Martin Freeman as Arthur Dent is perhaps the most inspired work ever. Freeman is perfect for the role and gives a performance so good that you wonder if he wasn't genetically bred for the role.Freeman is not alone in the marvellous casting. Sam Rockwell as the forever annoying Zaphod Beeblebrox knows exactly where to pull at your nerves, whilst Mos Def, whilst a surprise choice for Ford, is more than up to the task and gives us a unique take on the character.The script and plot as well are as wonderful as you'd expect. Mostly taken from Adams' excellent book, and partly written by the author specifically for the film, there are some lines which have the audience in the isles with laughter.Since so much is superb about this film, it's strange but something just didn't feel right. Perhaps it was a scene involving Arthur and Slartibartfast (Bill Nighy) which felt slightly too long and with too much graphic, perhaps it was a feeling that Marvin the Android (Rickman) wasn't in it quite as much as should have been. Ultimately, maybe the film feels too light. It inspires humour in some great places, but other than that, few other emotions are present. There's no feeling of tension, no sadness, no power, it all just falls a bit flat. The film has scenes which are meant to give you these emotions (mostly towards the end, so let's not refer to them for fear of ruining the plot), but it never really succeeds in achieving them.To bring this story to the big screen was always going to be a challenge, and for the most part, the creators should be truly proud of their creation. With the expected quality script, and some amazing performances, it's a film well worth watching. Sadly though, with one or two slight flaws and a crucial lack of emotion at times, the film is not quite as good as it really should have been. Still, I'm sure Doug would have been proud of the end product, and that's good enough for me.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

The movie has a slow paste to it, that comes with a choppy flow of information as it tries to describe what is going on. It feels like they try to put too many idea's into one film making it very confusing. I loved the quirky humor and CGI in the film. It's always fun to see different idea's for aliens. I was impressed with what they came up with, but the acting was terrible. Martin Freeman's part was boring and made you think ""why this guy?"" more then that why was he in a bathrobe for the entire show? Sam Rockwell's character was the most confusing. If he was the president than why was everyone trying to kill him? It was way to difficult to understand half of what was coming out of his mouth and why he was even there. I loved the robot Marvin played by the voice of Alan Rickman. Everything he said made me laugh as he truly was the greatest and unappreciated character in the movie. Zooey Deschnel was the greatest actor in the film, it would have been much better if she could have had better co-stars to act with.The plot is confusing, the movie is all over the place, the beginning is terrible.

Mos Def, who plays a part of Ford Prefetc, was a pleasant surprise, he fitted on that role like a glove in the hand. And for voice only acting, Stephen Fry does good job as the narrator/The guide and I really didn't find anything to complain about the voice of Marvin, Alan Rickman or the other voice overs. Very good job in that department.In the other hand it does lack a little as a movie, particularly in the over all storyline department. In example the whole deal with Humma Kavula (John Malkovich) is left wide open, screaming for possibility for a sequel. Only thing missing from the movie was ""To Be continued"" message from the end. And as his character was added there just for to movie he was left very vague and the whole thing felt little forced in.But over all pros win the cons and I really can recommend this one, even though you wouldn't be a fan of sci-fi genre in general.

91,bopdog,"Brilliant, goofy, and awe-inspiring. Improbably Wonderful! At last-- the best of British humor, in a Hollywood-quality classic!",10,28 April 2005,"The way they pulled all the elements together to make this thrilling mini-masterpiece constitutes a mini-miracle! The humor is very British--- weird, goofy, cutting, and subtle--- but will undoubtedly appeal to American and Canadian audiences as well. The special effects are not only jaw-droppingly good, they surpass most modern and 'serious' sci-fi movies, including the recent 'Star Wars' entries (except, it must be added now, the very latest, Star Trek 4, or whatever; the FX for that one were superb). Maybe that's because 'Hitchhiker's Guide...' aims only to please us, and dazzle us, and play with our imaginations, rather than to convince us of how cool it is. Dunno.... only know the FX here really work powerfully.There are so many examples of in-jokes, self-references, quadruple entendres, etc., I won't try to explain it all here. Get thee to a theater and see it for yourself! I will mention a few aspects of the movie that struck me, however. Perhaps that will be helpful to you.This will come as a surprise to some American audience members--- British humor is more than just Rowan Atkinson (a.k.a. the dreadfully annoying Mr. Bean) and Monty Python! I confess it--- I have never been a Monty Python fan (although I love many of the individual actors who have come from it). 'The Hitchhiker's Guide...' is actually a more prominent, and far better, version of British Humor, in my opinion. Admittedly, I only laughed out loud half a dozen times, but I was smiling with joy and satisfaction all the rest of the time. The wit, satire, and 'stoopid' gags throughout this movie are a wonder and a delight.The casting was superb. Funny--- in American movies, they often cast British sounding actors for the 'exotic' roles. The Nazi generals, the international crime mastermind, a Ceasar, The Emperor of the Galaxy in Star wars, etc. The 'foreign' British voices give the roles panache and otherness for an American audience, maybe. Here, in this British (-ish) movie, it is reversed-- some of the exotic roles are cast with American voices. Zooey Deschanel is marvelous--- she is the Thinking Man's Hottie. Mos Def is great as well. Sam Rockwell, playing Zaphod Beeblebox, President of the Galaxy, is an as-yet-uncelebrated genius. Rockwell is so funny, and so off-the-wall. He and Deschanel are very appealing.The Vogons are played with vicious understatement as Victorian English Bureaucrats. Alan Rickman, as the voice of Marvin the ever-present robot with severe depression is a master stroke. Without revealing the details, I will say that Marvin's personality plays a decisive role in the plot, and a huge laugh in the theater. Rickman and Sam Rockwell starred together in the excellent 'Galaxy Quest', another sci-fi comedy from when... 1999 or so? Bill Nighy is another gem, giving a small, but exquisite performance---- gosh, there is so much to comment on, I am forced to simply gloss it all from here.One thing I did not expect was the genuine atmosphere of great fantasy generated by the space scenes, and the FX shots. It was truly awe inspiring! How long has it been since you had a real sense of awe and wonder and joy with movie sci-fi FX? It's been a long while for me. This movie was innocent enough, and expertly done, to restore that precious experience in a theater--- For me, anyway, and the Cardiff audience I saw the movie with today, opening day.At last--- a British sci-fi movie on a par with Hollywood! That's a small miracle in and of itself. Go see it, you'll love it. I gave this a well deserved 10 out of 10.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
92,innocuous,Not a fan of the TV series...this didn't change my mind.,4,23 September 2005,"I know it's heresy, but this movie is obviously made for the HGG buff. The humor is definitely outdated and the only pleasure I can imagine someone getting from watching the film is so they can find the ""in"" references and jokes.The CGI effects are often a joke. (Check out John Malkovich's upper body in his scene on the table. Embarrassing for a film made in 2005. Many movies made in the 60s did much better.) The acting is only a touch above the average Dr. Who episode and the characters are just downright unappealing (and irritating).If you want to see this sort of thing done a little bit better, check out ""Buckaroo Banzai"". I would put this movie more on a level with ""Howard the Duck"".It was a real effort for me to stay awake through the whole movie.Not recommended for anyone who isn't a HUGE fan of the earlier series and other versions of HGG.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

It is quite good course if to consider that the world around of a galaxy in the movie is worked out worst of all. The name completely doesn't reflect validity of the movie! It is the real clickbait! Where at least several memorable locations and other races? Everything that show it Earth and some dumps. Why other beings who one in one are similar to people live not on Earth?

94,dr_foreman,"well-meaning, but not that funny",6,3 June 2005,"I'm a rabid Anglophile, and it's always vexed me that, of all the great cultural products to come out of England, ""The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"" is one of the most popular. Sure, it's a fine, funny book, but there is so much better British stuff out there that a mild sci-fi spoof seems unworthy of so much attention. But maybe that's just me.My general view is that science fiction is dorky enough when taken seriously. When combined with comedy, it becomes ultra dorky. The humor here is hilarious, sometimes, but just as often it's nerdy and clannish. For example: why is ""42"" a gut-bustingly funny answer to the question ""what is the meaning of life""? I think people have been pretending to laugh at that joke for years, without really understanding why they should be laughing.Adams' world does have its charms, though. I do think Vogon poetry, and the Guide itself, are inspired concepts. The film, sadly, does not translate these concepts well; nobody in my local theater laughed at the poetry scene. I think the CGI special effects and other big-movie stylings are actually a distraction from the core value of the book - understated humor. No doubt the cheapo BBC TV adaptation captures the wit of the books more effectively.On the plus side, the film is pretty well cast. Stephen Fry is a great choice for the know-it-all guide (especially since he played a know-it-all on ""Jeeves and Wooster""), and Alan Rickman cracked me up as Marvin. I was slightly disappointed in Martin Freeman, who is awesome in ""The Office,"" but too sedated here to make much of an impression. It doesn't help that his romance with Trillian is far too sincere to fit comfortably with the rest of the film.Ultimately, I was entertained enough not to feel cheated out of the ticket price, but I can't really recommend this. It's a flawed adaptation of a superior, but still flawed, book. There's a whole lot of better stuff out there.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

Though very strange I kinda like the movie and find it to be very joyful and lively; also without a doubt more than half the people wouldn't enjoy it. It purely base on the taste of each individual person.Before the earth is to be destroyed by alien, one man and his close friend hitchhike on the alien spaceship. That is when they whacky adventure around the universe begin.I like this movie because of its strangeness and how creative it is; really creative. Base on the story outside of this world and almost everything in this movie can't be seen like other movie. It is very unique and very interesting concept, though most of the concepts are more or less useless. And through out the movie the pace of the flick is very interesting and the casts work out just fine, in fact they all bring out the characters very well. The directing and the amount of detail is awesome, surpass expectation and way too good.

96,Antagonisten,Fair try,5,11 July 2007,"It's always a mixed emotion seeing one of your favorite books filmed. While i was surprised in a good way by ""Lord of the Rings"", that's not the usual reaction. So i waited for quite a long time before i finally watched ""The Hitchhike's Guide to the Galaxy"".The books have a quirky sense of humor that i consider to be one of the best examples of true British humor. It's low-key and yet hysterical. Transferring that kind of subtle and rather complex humor to a movie is not an easy thing. And the movie does have problems with that. While it sometimes works surprisingly well, it's mostly a failure. For instance the depressed ramblings of the robot Marvin doesn't come off half as well in the movie as in the book, despite having the perfect actor for the part (Alan Rickman). In general i thought the casting was great, and that the actors did a good job.And the script? Well of course that's perhaps the most important thing. I wouldn't say that it's bad really. Rather i would say that they did the best they could under the circumstances. It falls short, but it's still better than i feared.I guess in a way the biggest problem for this movie is that so much of the comedy is for the people who have read the books. And yet, those people will mostly just think about all the fun stuff that could never fit in a movie. So no matter which way you see it, they lose. It was a fair try, but i'd rather they didn't try in cases like these.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
97,EmperorNortonII,Douglas Adams' Legacy,9,12 May 2005,"The late Douglas Adams left us his great creation, ""The Hitchhiker's Guide To the Galaxy."" Finally, the long-awaited movie version of the hilarious sci-fi novel is here. The faithful fans of Douglas Adams will not be disappointed! Although the movie is not completely faithful to the book, it is still very much in Adams' style. (The Books themselves are not 100% faithful to the original BBC Radio series, after all.) I was happy with most of the casting, although there were some elements from the book I wished were in the movie. But the look of the movie is excellent, from the grotesque Vogons and their boxy spaceships to the transformations of the Spaceship Heart of Gold. Martin Freeman is well cast as English nebbish Arthur Dent, and Sam Rockwell turns in a wacky performance as Zaphod Beeblebrox. The Guide entries are accompanied by some excellent animated skits by Shynola. Anyway, ""Hitchhiker's Guide"" has me looking forward to the movie version of ""The Restaurant At the End of the Universe.""",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
98,raypdaley182,"Right, where's my towel?",8,29 April 2005,"The awful ""so long, and thanks for all the fish"" opening number really kills the ""start"" of this movie. The film is about 15 minutes in and then the earth is destroyed and then they cue ""Journey of the sorcerer"" and the film really starts. I was almost in tears. On the whole, the cast were well placed, I don't think Steve Pemberton tried to put anything new into Prosser which was a shame. Martin freeman, despite the fact that I wanted so badly to hate him did a good job being his own Arthur without straying too far from Simon Jones' original characterization. Marvins new body was iffy but the nods to the original Marvin (in the queue @ the Vogon forms office and the Mic used to read poetry - it really looked like old Marvin's face). i like that the Vogons are in business suits as they are sticklers for forms and law. very cool. I don't think anyone truly explained the word Belgium to the performers or it wouldn't have been used where it was, very poorly. I think the gun shoot-out on Arthur's lawn was a revised version of the shooty & bang-bang galactic cops scene from the series. The slapstick ""thinking"" scene on Vogsphere was bloody dire and pointless. trillian lent nothing new to her own role, no-one seemed to have researched Zaphod's outfit @ the islington party where Arthur and trillian meet. And what was all this crap about Arthur's job @ the BBC, that must have been cut as it was never even hinted at. the John Malkovitch scenes were pointless, go get into a storyline that isn't concluded. i think the DVD release will have so much to put back into the film. I get the point this was 2hrs 30 minutes long and cut badly to fit under 2 hrs.Go see it for yourself.

99,MichaelMargetis,An Unfullfilling Space Journey,5,30 April 2005,"Going into to the movie theater playing 'The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy', I was kind of pessimistic about how the film was going to turn out. The coming attractions made it look very interesting and people I know who read the novel said is was fantastic. But something unexplainable about the commercials and hype of the film caused me to think I'd be sorely disappointed with it. I wanted the movie to be great, but some instinct I had told me it wouldn't be. That instinct was correct. 'The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy' is not a bad film, it's highly entertaining at times, but it just doesn't quite do it for me when all is said and done. Something about the film just didn't work and it really didn't sit right with me.'The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy' follows a human, Arthur (Martin Freeman) whose house is about to be bulldozed down by a construction company making way for new apartments. He protests the destruction but is later told by his extra-terrestrial friend Ford Prefect (Mos Def) not to worry about it because all mankind will be destroyed when martians destruct the earth to make way for an inter-galatic freeway in 12 Minutes! Arthur doesn't believe his alien friend, until it starts to happen. Then Ford and Arthur leave the planet by hitchhiking onto the martian ships set to destroy Earth. In space, the two live by the handbook entitled 'The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy' as they begin to hitch hike from ship to ship. On their way they meet the President of the Galaxy, Zaphod Beeblebrox (played by the hysterical and energetic Sam Rockwell) and travel with him and the human who saved from Earth, Trillian (Zooey Deschannel), who is an old acquaintance of Arthur's. They go on an adventure led by Zaphod to find the meaning of life, going from planet to planet to find an answer. They also bring along a little manic-depressive genius robot (voiced by Alan Rickman) who always brings them down with his depressing scenarios. The film is interesting in that it provides us with interesting theories about life and impressive visual effects. But, the story really drags in the end. The ending is over-written and too thought out, it drags in a way that it almost put me to sleep at 2:30 in the afternoon (when I viewed it). The acting is not too shabby in the film, with a handful of cameos from John Malkovich, Helen Mirren, Bill Nighy and Stephen Fry who is the narrator of the film (who we never get to see, but only hear). The directing is about what's to be expected from this kind of movie, and the writing is actually pretty good when it isn't tedious towards the end. I think the film had good intentions, but it kind of lost it's way during the final act. There are parts of 'Hitchhiker' that are very humorous and original, but there are parts of intended humor in the film that don't really get chuckles out of the audience. A lot of the humor is very dry and satiric, which is kind of an unusual thing for this kind of flick -- the big, loud pre-summer blockbuster. Although I got most of the humor, I think a lot of it plays above it's average audience member (mostly kiddies or pre-teens). When I'm asked if it is honest to the book, I can't comment one way or the other on that because I've never read it or took any interest in reading it (hell, I didn't even know what it was about until I saw the movie previews for this). I did however overhear two guys who were fans of the book ahead of me in the movie theater saying they enjoyed it, if that counts for anything.In conclusion, 'The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy' is a semi-fun but semi-tedious space adventure that's appropriate for almost all ages, although I think adults will tend to appreciate the brand of humor more then most children. It has some great special effects, action sequences and costumes, but you really have to pay close attention to what is going on during the film, because it's extremely confusing (especially if you are not familiar with the novel). I unfortunately can't recommend it to you to see in the theaters, but it's a good film to rent when it becomes available to blockbuster. If you are a real action buff and you like Sci-Fi, I'd go see it in the theater because the visual effects and sound is better experienced on the big screen then it would be at home on DVD. I hope summer brings better action flicks than this. Grade: C+ (screened at AMC Arizona Center 24, Phoenix, Arizona, 4/29/05)",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

It has some of my favourite people involved in it. Freeman, Fry, Nighy, Mirren, Rockwell and The League of Gentleman team. But it is almost unwatchable. It has not even a smile let alone a laugh in it. I tried watching the TV series some years ago but the popularity of that venture entirely escaped me as this movie does. On the positive side it looks OK-the costumes and sets are fine. The script just does not work in any respect. I found my mind wandering and losing interest from the beginning. The only plus is Martin Freeman's performance which suggests the bewilderment of his character very well (he seemed nearly as bewildered as me). I think the addition of American actors did not do this project any favours as it is so British in its attitude.

I especially like the merger of J...(read more)I'm Henson creature shop puppetry and animation with contemporary CGI, it compliments the comic and absurdist tone of the work perfectly. No movie adaptation will ever be as ingenious as the book, there's just too much detail, but this movie does a good job of distilling the wit, absurdity, imagination, and bittersweet humanism that made the books such compelling reads in the first place. This film does a remarkable job of bottling the wild energy of the universe as a joke, while still remaining simple almost fairy taleesque. The story is of Arthur Dent, who wakes one da find his house is going to be destroyed to pave way for a freeway, only to be informed a few minutes later by a friend that the earth is about to be destroyed to pave way for an intergalactic freeway, and they have only moments to leave. What follows is cosmic trip with manic depressive robots, singing dolphins, John Malkovich as a cyborg with metallic spider legs, and the answer to ""life, the universe, and everything"", as well as anything the ""infinite improbability drive"" can throw out, which given the nature of the improbable...you can guess is a lot of stuff. There's a lot of movies about ""the meaning of life"", and ""Hitchhikers Guide to The Galaxy"" is one of the few that I can honestly say I agree with wholeheartedly.

102,CinematicInceptions,Not completely accurate to the book and a bit more mainstream. Pretty good tribute to the original story.,8,19 June 2015,"This is another perfect example of how complicated making a book into a movie can be. Sometimes it's exactly the same, sometimes it's completely different and there are arguments that say one is better than the other. You've got the people who say that there's no point in retelling the same story, people who hate seeing their favorite book modified even a little, and people who just want to see actors and spfx added to a story they already like. Making a movie from a book is probably harder than we laymen think it is, so it's probably not our place to criticize it. But here, I felt like they did a decent job turning hitchhikers into a movie with a more concrete storyline. They reduced some of Douglas Adams' original absurdity, probably to be more commercially pleasing and not seem like they were copying Monty Python. The first hour is pretty true to the book, but starts diverting a bit after Magrathea.The story is a minor element since its a comedy, but there is still a definite story line. A lot of it involves Arthur getting used to being in space, and it has a lot of the same stuff as the book with Magrathea, Slartibartfast, the ultimate question, and the Vogons. There is an added plot engine of Zaphod having to get the point of view gun for Humma Kavula and another one where Trillian has to be rescued from Vogosphere. Because of this, the Vogons are more of a present force than in the books. Arthur Dent is our mostly passive protagonist. I thought Martin Freeman was a great casting choice and he really added to Arthur's personality especially in the scene just before we meet Slartibartfast. Zaphod is pretty much exactly the same as in the book, though with a southern American accent. It was pretty fun to see him kidnap himself and steal the heart of gold. Ford is also much the same as he is in the books, with some personality and screen time, but not a lot of depth. I didn't feel like Mos Def was quite the right casting choice, even though he did a good job with the part. Trillian is given a bigger role since she becomes a bit more of an internal goal for Arthur. Marvin the robot is great in almost every regard with his constant depression and irritation. The minor roles of Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz, Deep Thought, the mice, Eddie the computer, and Slartibartfast are retained with respect to the book characters. Humma Kavula and Questular Rontok are relatively important characters that aren't seen in the book, though Humma is mentioned a couple times. It took me a while to figure out who Questular was, and they probably could have chopped her character. I'm not sure this counts as a character, but the Guide is also a present force in the film, and is voiced by Stephen Fry, who I felt like was a perfect casting decision.Of course, the prominent element is comedy. They kept a number of lines and concepts from the book like the improbability drive, the whale above Magrathea, the history of the ultimate answer, the Vogon poetry scene, and several of the more memorable excerpts from the Guide. There were also a jokes that were added by the screenwriters, but kept the same tone as the rest of the humor and sometimes came from other parts of the series and were adapted differently. Some examples are the point of view gun, the sneezing church, the creature that thinks if you can't see it then it can't see you, the dolphin song at the beginning, the post-42 Deep Thought, and the anti-idea field on vogosphere.Most of the execution was pretty good, though there were a couple of spots where the special effects could have been better. The script was entertaining of course, and the acting to accompany it was pretty good from everyone. It's not the most technological space movie out there, but neither does it have to be.If you like the novels, particularly the first one, I can't guarantee that you'll like the movie, but I do think it's worth your time to watch the whole thing. If you aren't familiar with the books, I'll just say that it's like a slightly more mainstream intergalactic Monty Python. If you like any of the main actors, with the exception of John Malkovich and Hellen Mirren because of the size of their roles, they should be incentive enough to give it a try.

This is the only movie in recent memory that I actually walked out of the theater. Not only that, but I took it one step further and asked to see the theater manager and demanded my money back (which he did)! I refused for 1 cent of my hard earned money to go to the people who made this piece of garbage. I find it hard to understand how any Christian could sit through this.I knew nothing of the books or series before seeing this. I also new little of the reviews before seeing this - much to my regret. I thought it was just going to be a satirical sci-fi, with a harmless PG rating at that. Boy was I wrong. I'm usually pretty informed on a movie's contents before seeing it, but this was a very spur-of-the-moment impulse. What a mistake - needless to say, I have never made THAT mistake again!Early on, the narrator makes several references to the main character being an ""ape-descendant."" Shortly afterwards, the main character is shown at a costume party and meets his love interest, who is dressed up as Darwin. It's very evident that Darwinism and evolution are being presented which is not uncommon and not real ""shock"" material. I could overlook that.However, I was APPALLED when the narrator begins explaining to the viewer WHAT ""The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy"" is. To paraphrase: It's a 'hugely popular book'. More popular than the three best selling books ever: 1) ""Where God Went Wrong,"" 2) ""Some More of God's Greatest Mistakes"" and 3) ""Who is this God Person Anyway?"" That did it for me. I was appalled and shocked by the BLATANT blasphemy. I think I expected a lot of tongue-in-cheek, sci-fi silliness but certainly nothing like this. There is also a direct mocking of salvation in the scene where he says ""wipe us clean with your white handkerchief"" or something like that. Here are some direct quotes from IMDb:Humma Kavula, Congregation: (singing) ""Oh mighty Arkleseizure, thou gazed from high above. And sneezed from out thy nostrils, a gift of bounteous love. The universe around us emerged from thy nose. Now we await with eager expectation, thy handkerchief, to bring us back to thee."" (End singing)... ""Let us pray. Oh mighty one, we raise our noses to you blocked and unblown, send the handkerchief O blessed one that we may be wiped clean.""... ""Atchoo!""... ""Bless you.""That's about all I can tell you (because I walked out and didn't see the rest).

106,LivingDog,True to the original,1,12 November 2005,"I saw the _original_ BBC TV production of this magnificently imaginative story. It was simply the most brilliant thing I have ever seen - that was some 20 years ago. Today is Nov. 2005 and it's still true - b/c the remake is about as good as a not good thing can be without being any better than below average.After seeing the _original_ BBC TV production I then read the 4(?) books which were written by Douglas Adams and upon which the TV show was based. The books were just as good as the show. (British TV productions are usually on the level of high school performances, but the quality of the story is so high, strong, and powerful that the production becomes unimportant. See e.g. any of Tom Baker's ""Dr. Who"" episodes.) There are 2 more books after the BBC show stopped making them. I continued to read and was utterly lost in the imagery - literally - I had no idea what Mr. Adams was talking about. And I have an active imagination! So I put the books down and lived with knowing that I saw the best BBC TV show ever - ever.Along comes this remake in 2005. Some suited genius decides to bring this brilliant story to the ""big screen"" (which is now no larger than a large plasma screen TV set). Be that as it may, this production was superior to the original and therefore lower in quality. All of the actors failed to make me care about any of the characters - except for Zaphod (well played by Sam Rockwell (Galaxy Quest) - I am a fan of his b/c of his excellent playing of ""Crew Member #5"" in Galaxy Quest"").The role of Ford Prefect was well played, but I kept wanting to see Orlando Jones - who would have made this movie far more fun and exciting and comedic.The role of Marvin, voiced by Warwick Davis, while absolutely true to the lines of the original (who gets a ""walk-on"" in 2 scenes) was not true to the original robot. What a shame - the original LOOKED seriously depressed. This one looked seriously marketable! (cute, huggable, ""kiddies will luv it!"" - blehhh!) Zooey Deschanel as ""Trill"" was OK.Martin Freeman as our persevering Arthur Dent was a very reasonable and almost believable Arthur - the pj's, the towel, the perpetual stare of confusion in a universe gone mad - well, that's all done by Mr. Adams' script now isn't it?If anyone deserves a reward for being absolutely true to the original it is Stephen Fry who played the Narrator and voice of ""The Guide."" I had an impossible time trying to see it as anything else other than the original... unless Stephen Fry IS Peter Jones!?!? :)Another winner is Thomas Lennon as Eddie the Computer (voice).John Malkovich as Humma Kavula was annoying.1/10-LD",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
107,HelenMary,Disappointing as book/radio series fan but tribute to the genius that was Douglas Adams,6,16 January 2013,"I've got to be honest, this was a disappointment. I'm a huge fan of the 'Trilogy in Five parts' and the radio series and so know the books well and I didn't feel this was a faithful adaptation. However, that said, Douglas Adams himself was heavily involved in it and if he thought it fine then it's fine with me. I watch it for what it is, something to do with the HHGTTG and as such I enjoy it, and you can't get all the intellectual witty asides from the book into a film or Stephen Fry would have had to narrate the entire thing! The casting was always going to be tricky but I think Martin Freeman is fine as Arthur Dent. Of course the gravitas of Stephen Fry as the eponymous book is perfect. Sam Rockwell, whilst a great actor, I didn't feel was Zaphod but he's grown on me and likewise Zooey Deschanel - who's great as the kooky 'New Girl' - just wasn't tough or 'Trillian' enough for me and I didn't understand the American influx as a traditionally English story. Of course Ford Prefect was a surprise in the guise as Mos Def but why shouldn't he be black? The colour of his hair from ginger (his only distinguishing feature in the book) is a minor change compared to some additions and omissions in the film, generally, and as Ford Prefect I think he did rather well. I liked his character the best, in fact. Bill Nighy was well cast as Slartibartfast but his acting was dreadfully staccato, where he was going for awkward and nervous. Aaaah, it worked, I guess.The computer graphics were a good homage to the original, and it was certainly a film for people who knew the in jokes (loved the prevalence of towels), but I didn't feel it was particularly well acted overall. The SFX were okay - but there was something missing for me. There were times when it looked so low budget then other times it really shone - the factory floor at Magrathea was amazing and quite emotional seeing all the world come back to life. Loved the Dolphin portions - and their song!!! There were moments of the happiness that I get from reading the book (or hearing the radio series) but not the whole film, but I'm glad it was a fitting tribute to the genius that was Douglas Adams and he approved. As a film it's good but you need some background to appreciate it, or perhapas it's better if you see it on it's own, I don't know... as a rendering of the book I'm less enamoured.So, where's the first sequel - The Restaurant at the End of the Universe?",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
108,kgprophet,Pythonesque TV Series Works on the Big Screen,6,30 April 2005,"I was a big fan of the original TV series. The main character, Arthur Dent, had the perfect innocent dweeb personality. The movie's good stroke of casting is Martin Freeman from BBC's ""The Office"" fame. His character in the series had the same kind of vulnerable straight man quality as he does playing Arthur Dent. The missed romance with Trillian is turned into a major plot point, and in the process gives the story much more heart than the series did. So fans - please please ignore the horrible opening song, a one note joke that deliberately flaunts ""Hey, we want you think this a Monty Python film"" . Casting is great all around. However, the Zaphod Beeblebrox character did not translate well. Whereas in the original TV series Zaphod was a rock 'n roller dude, in this film he seems to be a cocaine addict. Sam Rockwell, who was the squeamish fatalist ""Guard #3"" in Galaxyquest, comes off equally creepy here, but ends up being annoying instead of engaging. Little of what he says makes sense, and seems to try to get a laugh, but fails due to to incomprehensibility. His character should have been updated from the original 70's era material, perhaps a little re-tuning. What saves Hitchhiker's GTTG are the well made special effects. The Vogon blobs are truly hideous to behold. The planet factory is spectacular, and all other familiar set pieces are creatively designed. There are places where the movie treads into Monty Python/Terry Gilliam territory, seemingly on purpose. The Vogons live in a world nearly identical to Gilliam's ""Brazil"", where life and death hinges on having the proper form. People not familiar with the series will enjoy themselves. With little to analyse in how faithful the movie is to the original, you are treated to a fast paced and smart piece of science fiction lunacy. True laughs show up as well, including a race of people who worship snot. The new wrinkles thrown in start to derail the film in the third act. John Malkovich shows up prominently, requiring Zaphod to find a special gun in order to get his other head back. Now there's the good kind of mad cap humour, and then there's the dumb kind. When Zaphod becomes even more incoherent with a single head, we lose touch with the story. The rest of the third act nearly forgets the whole gun plot, save for a touching moment when it is fired and reveals Trillian's inner thoughts.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

But I felt that this film did justice to the book as I remember it. I am sorry that Douglas Adams did not get to see the finished product as I am certain he would have approved it as well. The cast was excellent and the ironic humor and satire that Adams built into his fiction all comes together brilliantly. The use of ""Journey of the Sorceror"" for the theme under the main titles was delightful, as it has always been one of my favorites and at one time I hoped it would be the opening music for ""The Fellowship of The Ring.""

112,brenttraft,Absurbist Humor,8,1 May 2005,"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is a very funny movie, but it has more in common with Salvador Dali than with Ben Stiller or Adam Sandler. It is not rolling in the aisles ha-ha funny as much as it is absurd-funny.And that is more or less the whole point of the movie, the books, the radio shows, and the TV series. The story makes a big deal out of the quest of the meaning of ""life, the universe, and everything;"" and ultimately the answer to the ""big question"" is that it is absurd and that it is best to enjoy it while you can. The same can be said for this film.There have been some negative reviews that say the film is not as good as the books or the other realizations of the Douglas Adams stories. I had not read the books for about 20 years, but I enjoyed the film and it was an accurate interpretation of my memory of the books and TV show. The casting was great! This is the first film that was not disappointing so far this year. It is a fun film and uplifting in an absurdist type of way. Highly recommended!",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

So I would recommend the novel over the film at any day. The film constitutes a highly imperfect and flawed adaptation of the novel that fails to truly engage the viewer and after I watched it a had a bad feeling in my mouth. It was one of the weakest science fiction films I have ever watched and I watched many science fiction films over the years. The jokes are rather weak and overall the film fails to truly entertain, instead it feels to be forced all the time.I wouldn't recommend this film.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
114,Miles-10,Not my favorite version,7,8 May 2005,"Because ""Hitchhikers' Guide"" has now appeared in every medium including books, comic books, radio, TV, film, video games, audio and video recordings, one can choose one's favorite medium. Unfortunately, I cannot rate this film version as the best. The radio version is my favorite. There the comedic timing is faster, the character, Trillian, is more substantial and acerbic. Part of the problem is that the film has to slow things down in order to show us the picture of each joke, and this not only slows down the timing but--despite high quality special effects--can't match my imagination for visuals.However, this version definitely has its moments. Although Mos Def is not how I pictured Ford Prefect, he gives one of the best sustained performances in the movie. John Malcovich is substantial (I keep using that word, don't I) but under-used. Martin Freeman is only an adequate Arthur Dent. Sam Rockwell is fairly good as Zaphod. (Though I never liked the character he plays in any version.) Zooey Deschanel (sp?) is a big empty spot on the screen. I could not care less about Arthur's pursuit of her. It diminishes his character that he is interested in her. Marvin the depressed robot is funny although I don't like the way they made him look. Too literal; his head does not have to be almost larger than his body and round just because he has that line about his brain being larger than a planet.The movie leaves out one of my favorite jokes from the book and radio: Ford tells Arthur that before he visited earth, the only thing that the Hitchhikers' Guide had to say about our planet was, ""Harmless."" Ford allows that he will revise that. After indicating that this is overdue, Arthur asks what the new entry about earth will say. ""Mostly harmless,"" replies Ford.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
115,Pookyiscute,Booorrrriiiinnnnngggg....,3,16 January 2006,"Let me just begin by saying, that I have never read the book, and I wasn't around when it came out either, and even if I were to give the book the benefit of the doubt, the movie still sucked. It was like a really bad knock off of 'Star Wars'. The characters were funny, but at the same time, I don't think I laughed once. I was expecting so much more from the film, because I'd heard such great things about it, but it was not only slow, and made no sense, but it also left me feeling like I'd become stupider for having seen it, somehow.I can appreciate only certain elements and situations from the film. I liked the idea behind it, and again, having not read the book, I still maintain that it was probably much more detailed and a much better read than watch. But, the fact of the matter is, the movie did the story absolutely no justice. It was boring beyond words, and even if sometimes it made sense it was still hard to follow, because it was so boring. I felt like I had to watch it, since I'd paid to rent it. The make-up was exceptionally good, and especially the giant creatures that they used to scare the audience and the characters inside the film with, were very well thought out in design and such, but generally it wasn't very scary. The acting was very good, and I felt that everyone in the film should get paid double than what they probably did, because of how bad the movie was, that they had to be in this thing. I wouldn't be surprised, if for some of the actors, you never see them make another good film, because of this.I was disappointed to see Sam Rockwell and Zooey (last name?), in this. They are both very good actors, and I expected more from them than a choice like this. Alan Rickman was the only comic relief I felt, and rightly so. He played the voice of a manic depressive robot, and that I would have to say, along with an upbeat computer navigating the space ship, were the only entertaining parts of the film.I have seen better sci-fi comedies, like, 'Galaxy Quest' or 'Spaceballs'. This just did not take the cake, and it was very badly represented on screen. I don't recommend this, even as a rental.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
116,aramis-112-804880,Surprisingly Pretty Acceptable,7,27 May 2018,"Lots of strange terms are slung around by this movie's reviewers, like ""Hardcore Hitchchiker Fans"" or that some of Adams' ideas are replaced by a ""general silliness."" Poppycock.I came to HITCHHIKER in college (early 80s), first by the dodgy tv series, then the books, then the kickoff radio series--which is my favorite HH incarnation. Though I collected books, records, tv shows and even the text-based video game (which I wasted hours playing and never won), my favorite part of Adam's ridiculous tour of the galazy is Zaphod's going to the Frogstar, then having the seance with his great-grandfather, then Arthur meeting Lintilla . . . stuff lots of HItchhiker fans who call themselves ""hardcore"" won't know anything about. Like the ""Twin Peaks"" fans who thought the Black Lodge was the important thing and loved ""The Return"" while the original fans who loved the original characters thought it was a travesty. In fact, in its original conception, the radio ""Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"" was meant to be, first and foremost, funny. Though because of his extremely tangential connections to ""Monty Python"" and ""The Burkiss Way to Dynamic Living"" (for which he penned one of the funniest sketches), Adams' chief influence was the humor writer P. G. Wodehouse, whose books had no other purpose in life but to bring people laugh. As Adams had in the beginning. And this movie has no other purpose but the excite and entertain and bring a few laughs (unfortunately, it places excitement over laughs, which is bad in my book).So, we have radio shows, television shows, books, plays, games, and . . . they're all different! Back in the day, as a young HH fan, when I quickly snapped up the newly published LIFE, THE UNIVERSE AND EVERYTHING, I hoped to find Lintilla in it. No such luck. All new versions disappoint the truly ""hardcore"" HH fans.That said, what about this new incarnation of ""HItchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy""? Well, it's amazing. Sam Rockwell is delightful as Zaphod. Mos Def isn't special as Ford, but Ford's purpose is basically exposition; he's never blatantly extraterrestrial apart from his knowledge, and that's Adams' fault. Martin Freeman's Arthur has little to do but look astonished, but think of the culture shock he's going through. Apart from Rockwell's weird and wild Zaphod, Zooey Deschanel is the best part. While not done up in a beautiful package like so many actresses, she brings more to Trillian than we get out of any other incarnation. In the original radio series she has so little to do (apart from bring the mice) she is eliminated from the second radio series without tears or a sense of loss. Zooey is like the woman ordinary Earthling Arthur Dent would fall for. And while her expressions are a bit over-acted for the big screen (even tv big screens, like I saw this movie on) she's the best Trillian yet.And BTW, I love the Vogons.Good things in the movie, without giving away too much: Simon Jones, the original Arthur Dent and the actor most associated with the role, turns in a delightful, if brief, performance as the Magrathean pre-recorded video that warns the Heart of Gold away. I hoped that meant he would be Slartibartfast, but in fact that part is taken by the hilariously uncertain Bill Nighy. It's hard to think of these characters apart from their original actors, but Nighy makes Slartibartfast his own, neither duplicating nor downgrading Richard Vernon in other versions (but the true HITCHHIKER fan keeps all the different versions compartmentalized). Nighy comes in late and injects a humor the movie desperately needs at that point. And the view of Magrathea's planet workshop is truly impressive. It may suffer from the problem other movies had (the first ""Star Trek"" movie comes to mind) that wants to impress so much it doesn't contain much humor or story.Bad: Well, not much. The original radio series ran six episodes (with another six later). The tv series ran three hours. And there were five books in the trilogy and counting with new authors. Naturally, some people's favorite lines are deleted. Some of my favorite HH lines also bit the dust. But different media have different requirements, and a movie that comes in under two hours needs truncation.Since becoming a HITCHHIKER fanatic I had a conversion to Christianity, while Adams was a militant atheist; so I had a bit of difficulty swallowing all the Temple scenes. But I was impressed at the shortcuts the movie took to get through Magrathea and the way Trillian learned the fate of the Earth and Zaphod's part in it (which she never knew in the original radio series). And, of course, a movie must be both conclusive (in case it's the only movie) and open-ended (for sequels). I think it achieved that well, with Arthur and Trillian.Altogether, this movie is both fascinating, astounding, jaw-dropping, funny and . . . well, perhaps a little disappointing for ""hardcore"" Hitchhiker fans who followed Adams' funny little ride through the galaxy for thirty or forty years in various media), who miss their favorite things (it's amazing how territorial we can be!).Nevertheless, it's a perfect little introduction to Adams and his world to those who have the joy of entering it for the first time. So it's both not as much as it could have been (with all the background material available) and more than I expected. I avoided this movie for thirteen years because I never thought it could live up to the previous HH incarnations, and I feel it's thirteen years wasted. Not perfect, not really funny enough (in radio, on tv, and in the books Adams' world was much funnier). But the new material is entertaining and fits pretty well. Adams (who helped construct this little flick before his timely death) is the only author in history with such ability to revise his fiction!Still, don't stop here. The text-based video game I enjoyed will hardly be to modern tastes, but don't leave HH. here. Hit the radio show, the books and the television series, whose effects are as funny as Adams' writing.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
117,Cedric_Catsuits,Almost but not entirely ...,8,18 April 2008,"As a fan of the books and not the radio or TV series, I viewed this with some suspicion. Books rarely translate well into other media, especially when they are the figment of such a fertile and whacky mind as that of Douglas Adams.True to form, the movie is not a wholly accurate reflection of the book, although I do not know to what extent Adams himself altered the screenplay. It is sufficiently recognizable to be considered a worthwhile - and long overdue - exercise, and tribute.Freeman fits the role of a permanently confuzzled Arthur quite superbly. At he other end of the scale, Def's Ford Prefect could not be further (especially in the physical sense!) from the character in the book - but it still works.My only real criticism is of the portrayal of Marvin as a dwarf spaceman with a giant golfball for a head. This is not how I imagined him at all, and it did detract from my total mental immersion to the story.All in all, very pleasing to a die-hard Adams fan - which is saying something.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
118,basrutten,Mostly harmless...eh successful,8,16 March 2006,"After years and years of waiting and a dozen different versions, the Hitchhiker's Guide finally makes it to the big screen for the first time. I always thought the book was pure genius, but for some reason I had my doubts about this movie: would all this quirky, high-brow, wordy humor really translate well to the silver screen, and would this be better than the dreadful eighties mini-series? After having finally seen it, though, I'd have to say that they did a splendid job.""Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"" (HG2G) follows the book quite well, although understandably only a fraction of the fun from the novel makes it into the book. That's not a huge problem though, since there's still definitely enough to laugh about, even though jokes from the book are sorely missed. That being said, there are some great new additions like the dolphin song which more or less make up for that.The story has been tightened up a bit, and people that have not read the book should have no problem figuring out what's going on (which is something that really can't be said about all book adaptations). Yes, some things do get lost a bit in translation (it never becomes really clear why towels are so great, for example) but I guess that's inevitable unless you want to make a five-hour movie.But most importantly, they just got the atmosphere just right. It's clear that everybody involved had a great time making this movie. Just about every actor does a splendid job as well: from the perpetually confused an tired-looking Martin Freeman as Arthur Dent to the appropriately annoying Sam Rockwell as Zaphod, these are the characters as I imagined them while reading the book.Not only does HH2G feel right, it also looks great. The special effects are great, the guide sequences are very stylish, and the Vogon puppets, although very different from how I imagined them, look fabulously gross as well. The one disappointment is Marvin, who simply doesn't look like a robot at all. Thankfully, the great voice work makes up for a lot.HG2G is in the end a mostly successful adaptation of the book. It looks great, it's delivered well by the entire cast, and it gets the spirit of the book right.

121,FairlyAnonymous,One of the most ingenious comedies and underrated movies,9,6 August 2011,"The HitchHiker's Guide To The Galaxy is a great movie that is mainly funny for those who have read the books. The movie doesn't follow the books strictly, but it has the same spirit and mood of the books. Honestly I am glad they changed it from the books because the books' plot wouldn't have done well. I think what put most people off by this movie is the fact that you need to know some knowledge from the books to get the humor which is really outrageous and random.The plot revolves around Earth blowing, and a human who survives because his alien friend hitchhikes onto an alien ship that destroyed Earth. The whole movie is funny and very enjoyable. There is rarely a scene that isn't funny, and the Vogons (did I spell that right) were made very well and were surprisingly detailed for puppets.I can't say too much about the plot about this movie, but I will say that it is hilarious, though some people may not enjoy its humor. I guess it is sort of like Monty Python and the Holy Grail: some people will love the humor and will find it amazing, or others won't enjoy the ingeniousness of it.

122,ScottDMenzel,"An interesting, sarcastically funny film that probably only 1/3 of all the audience members will like.",8,30 April 2005,"I remember seeing trailers for ""The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy"" a long time ago. It really intrigued my interests because the trailer basically just showed the earth blowing up and then states don't panic. Then I decided to look up the film and little did I know that the film was based on a book. I don't read books that often so I don't know much about this book. I know I really should find some more time to read more but then again I need to find more time to do a lot of things. Well anyway after reading about the movie and finding out Zooey Deschanel is in it, I had to see it and so I did so this evening.""Hitchhikers Guide"" is basically about a man by the name of Arthur Dent (Martin Freeman) who is having a bad day because his house is about to be crushed by a bulldozer. But then he gets the worst news of all when Ford Prefect (Mos Def) comes over and tells him that the world is going to blow up in a matter of minutes. So they hitch a ride on the spacecraft that is going to blow up earth and so begins the story of ""the Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy."" Let me first start out by saying this is not slapstick or on the surface gag comedy. It's not and for this reason alone I think most viewers, except people who actually read the book or like movies that have a dark or sarcastic sense of humor, will probably walk out of this movie half way through or just sit through it and say it sucks at the end. If you don't find yourself enjoying it fifteen minutes in your better off going out of the theater and asking for a refund because this is not your type of movie.With that being said, I must say that I really enjoyed the flick. By not reading the book I'm sure made me criticize the movie less since I don't really know what they left in, took out, or changed around. But I will say this ""The Hitchhikers Guide"" was a very unique movie experience. I see a lot of films probably more then 150 each year and I don't think I have seen anything quite like this film. The comedy in this film is very weird and underneath the surface of the film. Most will not get the jokes, I got some but feel a second viewing is in order to get the others I missed the first time around.The best character was the depressed robot named Marvin who was voiced by the talented Alan Rickman. He really cracked me up since he basically said he was depressed all the time and no one ever listens to him. Also the two main characters I liked the most were Mos Def who played Ford which I think he did a great job with. I really think Mos Def has a career in movies, he was great in this film and was good in ""The Woodsman"" and also "" Something the Lord Made."" Another around of applause is also needed for Zooey Deschanel who plays the role of Trillian and plays it marvelously. I know my schoolgirl crush on Zooey might make me seem a bit naïve on her but seriously I think she's a great actress and this film along with ""Manic"", ""Almost Famous"". ""All the Real Girls"" and ""Elf"" prove this. Sam Rockwell and Martin Freeman were also very good in their roles. I think most of the main stars in this film will have a very successful life in Hollywood.The film is a great film for not only making us think about the jokes in the film but also making us think in general. There is a lot of talk about the universe and the meaning of life. It's all very interesting to see a mainstream film be released that actually wants the audience to use their brains or maybe even question things in reality. I really enjoyed that aspect of this film.In conclusion, I really enjoyed ""The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy."" It was quite enjoyable and was very different from the big summer blockbuster popcorn flick I expected it to be. My only complaint about the film was that it sometimes was a little too silly. I know why too? It was trying to get the other audience members who weren't getting the underlining jokes to laugh or maybe even the little kids in the audience since the film was PG but seriously this isn't a kid's movie. Other then that, I really had no problem with the film. So in the end, it was a funny, interesting, and thought-provoking little film. I like how it had action, comedy and *gasp* even romance without making any of them the main focus of the film. It featured some good performances by some of Hollywood's new up and coming stars.MovieManMenzel's final rating for ""The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy"" is an 8 out of 10. Like I said earlier, If you think you may want to watch this film, I think you should check it out but if you sit in the theater and fifteen minutes in, you say I hope this gets better or this isn't funny, then you should just get up and ask for a refund because you probably won't like the film. And to be honest, that's OK because this film is not for everyone more so then most movies that have a particular audience.

Hated the sexist parts (catty women, gendered gun)",8,16 May 2005,"I was expecting of course to see a slightly different version than the books or the BBC television series from the 80's. I was OK with them cutting out bits of the book (though I think the scene where Ford convinces the foreman to lie in front of the bulldozer was one of the funniest parts and wouldn't have taken much extra screen time or confused the plot!) I was even OK with the Humma Kuvula character being totally randomly thrown in there. (I heard Douglas Adams put that in.) I could even sort of live with Zaphod's 2nd head not being seen most of the time and then being removed.However, the total changing of the central purpose of their journey really annoyed me. Throwing in some random gun they are searching for? (That highly sexist remark about the viewpoint gun not working on women really spoiled the movie a bit for me!) The point of the book was supposed to be this search for the ultimate question of life, the universe and everything - that's the plot - not some Disney-esquire romance or some Hollywoodlike insistence on a quest that will lead to an action sequence.That said, I did love the Zaphod=George W. Bush connection. It took me a while, but the drawl, the stupidity, the bad decisions. the tumbling economy and then finally that conversation about the populace electing someone stupid rather than someone who is intelligent and able to actually govern was hilarious!I liked Alan Rickman voicing Marvin, though I didn't like how Marvin looked (nice to see the old BBC version of Marvin standing in the queue?) The effects were pretty good. I was happy they used Henson studio aliens instead of using CG. Though I was most saddened by the omission of how the Babel Fish proved God didn't exist (was that a purposeful cut 'cuz of the Religious Right's stranglehold on our society these days?) I thought they did a good job keeping some of the Guide entries Stephen Fry sounded great as it's voice. Some of the added touches were quite good and added to the film. . I liked the ""Ok, I'm British I know how to queue"" line. The Magratha bit was especially well done - I loved the painting of the red rocks and the filling of the oceans. I also liked how they expressed the transitions during the improbability drive (theyarn sequence was really creative). I thought the casting was excellent all around. It was nice to not see a ditzy Trillian - however I was disappointed by how much they tried to make it a love story. (Speaking of false, 'love "" stories randomly thrown in- Who was the totally random Questular Rontok who was jealously obsessed with Zaphod? And why did her nearly only line have to be some sexist and stereotypical drivel/catty remark about Trillian being ""thin & pretty""?)The ending made me a bit sad, the point of the books is that life is random (and often sucky - Arthur loses his planet, a girl & can't even get tea) and ludicrous, and amusing, and worth thinking about, but mostly just being happy (instead of right)-- wrapping it all up neatly with a love story seemed to insult the point of the book.So I am highly ambivalent, I did over all, like it. It at least tried to stay faithful to the humor, philosophy and greatness of the books. Yes, it failed in a large part, but at least they tried. I would recommend this (though only after reading the novel(s)!) And I will wait for someone else to remake it in 20 years to see if their version is any better.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

It's hard to tell why, but the story and the characters just didn't catch me enough to make this a great movie.I like the theme and the technical aspect, but it just didn't click, It ended up boring me a bit.Besides all the craziness and freaky characters and situations, it still kind of fell on the clichéd romance thing and that totally spoiled the whole thing for me.

130,seaview1,The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy translates badly,6,27 April 2005,"One of the pleasures of seeing the filmic adaptation of a popular novel is the realization of the original source material while successfully functioning as a seemingly original movie. Although fans of cult favorite The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy may find reason to rejoice at the faithful rendition of their treasured classic, the film just does not work on its own.In present day Earth, Arthur Dent, an ordinary Englishman, finds his house about to be demolished by bulldozers sent to pave a highway. As Arthur frets over the imminent demise of his home, he is given solace by his buddy, Ford Perfect who has a secret to tell him. It seems that Ford isn't the person he says he is. In fact, humans aren't the most intelligent species on earth. Dolphins are ranked second while extraterrestrials are number one. And it seems that earth is about to be destroyed as Ford and Arthur are whisked away to safety by hitching onto an alien craft where Ford introduces his friend to a reference book, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. As Arthur is plopped into an unworldly environment, he waxes nostalgic over a previous chance encounter on earth with free spirited Tricia who ran off with another man. It turns out that it wasn't just any ordinary man. Suffice it to say that the story centers on a galactic cowboy, Zaphod, who is also a galactic president. Arthur and Ford later hitch a ride with Zaphod's spaceship. Space travel into untold worlds and dimensions are just the start of a wild ride that searches for the meaning of life and its paradoxical questions. In the midst of it all is poor Arthur. Homeless, will he find happiness and true love amid the vast wasteland of space?For decades, filmmakers have unsuccessfully attempted to translate Douglas Adams' phenomenon novel until right before his untimely death recently. Despite co-writing credits between Adams and Karey Kirkpatrick, it feels like many scribes had a hand in the monumental task of making the story cinematic. Director Garth Jennings does have a talent for imaginative visuals having come from a music video and documentary background. What he misses is the essence of what makes stories dear to the soul and yet have that hip, sophisticated fascination with the universe at large, no easy feat. He does not demonstrate an ability to balance intimate moments amid the grander, eye popping visuals. Even such British enterer's of the sixties like Bedazzled held a personal charm amid its superficial glitz and stylized chic.The cast is able, but it labors under erratic direction, continuity, and pacing. Martin Freeman (Shaun of the Dead) is a likable actor and destined for much better roles. His Arthur recalls an early Dudley Moore. He is capable of humor and romance but is not allowed to fully develop his sketch of a character. Sam Rockwell (so much better in a similar genre film, Galaxy Quest), overacts as Zaphod, an intergalactic free spirit. His character (which could easily have been portrayed by Luke Wilson) is just not very interesting. Other supporting roles are likewise superficial and lacking in much depth. Zooey Deschanel (Elf) as Tricia is cute and sorely limited in what she has to do. Rapper Mos Def (The Woodsman) plays Ford, and he almost triumphs in a part that quickly degenerates into a caricature. Alan Rickman is wasted as the increasingly tired voice of a manic depressive robot named Marvin as is John Malkovich in a throwaway role of Humma Kavula, Zaphod's chief rival. The film is filled with odd and unusual creatures but nothing moviegoers haven't already seen in any number of George Lucas' Star Wars cantinas.The film begins with an amusing song foreshadowing what is to come and sets the proper mood. The mistake the filmmakers made was to try to cater to the readers religiously and simultaneously forgetting to make sure that the film could stand on its own. It doesn't. While all the celestial concepts and vistas are important, they should have concentrated on the relationship of Arthur and his love, Tricia, so that there would be more emotional resonance and payoff toward the end. You feel little or nothing fulfilling at the finale. The film glosses over events and moments seemingly to make sure as much of the novel is included. Instead of a magically hip, psychedelic, intellectually hypothesizing journey into the time space continuum in search of meaning and love, it starts to feel like a jumble of scenes not unlike the sci-fi cult film Barbarella, but at least the latter had a groovy musical score and Jane Fonda. There's almost a Monty Python tone as a narrator describes the proceedings. Ah, but if only Terry Gilliam had done this! The best moments throughout the story are the graphic, animations that illustrate the guidelines, factoids, and rules of the universe. These mini cartoons illustrate the concepts in an amusing manner, and could easily have formed a stand alone film. To be successful, the film should have appealed to fans of the book and the uninitiated alike. Every time, you begin to want to give the film a chance to develop into something special, it jumps quickly and without punctuation to the next scene. Because it just does not resonate on its own and relies more so on its literary pedigree, it will have a hard time attracting general audiences. Perhaps true fans of the book will enjoy this long awaited adaptation of the beloved novel, but the rest of the populace will wonder what the fuss was really all about.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
131,dkncd,Altered Adams,8,26 September 2007,"""The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"" is an adaptation of Douglas Adams' radio series and book of the same name. Notably there was also a television version of the radio series and book released in 1981 by the BBC. Not surprisingly, the special effects here are more developed than those in the BBC version and look great. This film also features an excellent score, with songs like ""So Long and Thanks for All the Fish"" and ""Journey of a Sorcerer"", the latter of which was also in the BBC version.The casting of this film is appropriate, although not on par with the casting of the BBC version. Martin Freeman bumbles around well as Arthur Dent. Mos Def makes a fine Ford Perfect and Zooey Deschanel was well-cast as Trillian. Alan Rickman was a perfect choice to voice Marvin since he can always effectively express disappointment and unimpressed sarcasm. Sam Rockwell captures the arrogance of Zaphod Beeblebrox well and I was impressed by Bill Nighy's performance as Slartibartfast. John Malkovich has a good turn Humma Kavula, a character not in the original story. The portrayal of the Vogons in this film was highly amusing, even if their role was exaggerated from the original story. Lastly, Stephen Fry was an apt choice as the narrator for this film.The script is a reasonable adaptation of the radio series and book, but is also the most disappointing aspect of this production. The original work of Douglas Adams was altered here to make the plot more cohesive and develop a romance story. The original plot was loose and prone to humorous digressions, but I found that style more effective than the style here. A number of notable jokes from the original work are omitted and a lot of the jokes from the original were disappointingly diluted. This film also added a number of scenes not from the original that were amusing, but not as much as amusing as what was left out. I did enjoy the references in this film to the BBC version, which included a role for Simon Jones and a cameo for the Marvin from that version. Those that enjoy Adams' original work will find the BBC version, which to me isn't diminished by its older special effects, indispensable and likely better than this version. None the less, a diluted ""Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"" still makes for an amusing film.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
132,Benjamin_Cox,Very strange and very different - 77%,7,30 May 2005,"And so, after all this time, an era has ended. A saga lasting what seems like a lifetime has finally reached its conclusion. Yes friends, don't panic... because this is the very last hand-written review I'll write behind my bar at work, having sneaked off to Leicester Square to watch a movie... oh, hang on... (*editorial whispers in ear*) Sorry about that, folks. I was getting confused there, which is exactly how you'll feel if you're unfamiliar with the source material and you watch this. Fans of the classic books by the late great Douglas Adams will lap this up but for the uninitiated like myself, there is still much to enjoy in this silver screen version - and much to bamboozle as well.Our story starts at the end of the world where mankind discovers that the Earth is about to be demolished by an alien race called the Vogons in order to build an intergalactic bypass. Coincidentally, the same thing is happening to the house of English everyman Arthur Dent (Martin Freeman) who is rescued from the destruction of the planet by alien-in-disguise friend Ford Prefect (Mos Def). Hitch-hiking onto a very strange spaceship with two-headed Galaxy President Zaphod Beeblebrox (Sam Rockwell), fellow Earthling and the object of Arthur's desire Trillian (Zooey Deschanel) and depressed robot Marvin (voiced by Alan Rickman), Arthur's unusual day (""Must be a Thursday, I could never get the hang of Thursdays..."") gets even stranger as the angry Vogons give chase. Still, at least the dolphins are OK...Without a shadow of a doubt, this is the most British film I've seen in ages and if you liked films like ""Shaun Of The Dead"" then you'll know what I mean. Adams has done a marvellous job of marrying together lavish visuals and Hollywood gloss with typically British dead-pan humour and a hero who longs for a cup of tea. It is also very strange indeed, veering off at random intervals thanks to the erstwhile Hitchhiker's Guide (voiced perfectly by Steven Fry) into complete madness, such as the musings of a sperm whale as it hurtles through the sky towards the ground at terminal velocity. Aliens spouting poetry (and very bad poetry at that), talking mice and the mind-blowing Improbability Drive are all present and warping my brain as you struggle to take it all in. No such problems with Rockwell's riotous performance as the insane ego-driven superstar leader who's dressed to kill but dumber than fans of the Crazy Frog ring-tone.But crucially, it is still funny and more so if this is your first foray into the world of the Hitchhiker's Guide. This film adaptation has its moments but unless you're a fan, keeping up with the runaway tale is very difficult. Like the supercomputer searching for the solution to the ultimate question, you feel like this film is asking you questions but you've no idea what they are. Zaphod and Marvin are just brilliant but Mos Def looks lost as Ford - slight miscast, perhaps? Visually, it's very impressive though it will probably be overshadowed by another certain sci-fi film released this summer (damn you, Darth), which is a shame. This is a competent update of an ageing story, told many times in many forms, and it serves as a fitting tribute to Adams, who died before it's completion. If you like something a little different or a sci-fi stoner movie that isn't ""Barbarella"" then check out the ""Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy"". So long, and thanks for all the fish...",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
133,oshram-3,A worthy re-do of an old classic,7,3 May 2005,"By now any sci-fi fan worth his salt (and even many who are not) has heard of Douglas Adams' work; and this on in particular has been made available in at least four media: first as a book, then (I believe) a radio show, then a BBC miniseries, and now a film. Just how many times and how many ways can you tell the same story? Well, keep in mind that before there were Tolkien films there were extremely well-done radio shows, so often there is a market for more than one version of a story. But is this film really necessary? That's a tougher one to answer. Adams purists might say no, as the visual version was covered so well in the late 70s with a magnificent miniseries that covered the first two books. As I was fond of that version, I was extremely skeptical of this version going in, especially as the only word of mouth I heard was not supportive.The story you're probably familiar with: the Earth is destroyed by the foul Vogons to make way for a hyperspace bypass, and luckless everyman Arthur Dent (Martin Freeman) is only saved at the last second because his best friend Ford Prefect (Mos Def) turns out not to be from Cornwall but rather from a small planet in the vicinity of Betelgeuse. From there the duo get involved with Trisha MacMillan, a.k.a Trillian (Zooey Deschanel) and numbskull president of the galaxy Zaphod Beeblebrox (Sam Rockwell). Along for the ride is the paranoid, manic depressive android Marvin (voiced by Alan Rickman).Most of the joy of Douglas' work is his absurd prose (""the Vogon ships hung in the air exactly the way bricks don't""), and obviously some of that will be lost in a film version. But by keeping some of the better known entries from the Hitchhiker's Guide itself  the book features prominently in the film, although not as prominently as it did in the miniseries  the film manages to insert little snippet's of Douglas' words throughout. It stays relatively true to the spirit of the books, even if a fair bit is cut out and some things are changed at the end.Freeman has a tough job playing Arthur Dent. Dent is our entrée into the strange and absurd galaxy, and as such he's a little staid and dull (book four of the series centered solely on him, and it was a raving bore). But Freeman manages to make Dent likable (just as Simon Jones did all those years ago) and captures Arthur's frumpiness perfectly. Mos Def lacks presence as Ford Prefect, who is really much more prominent in the book; Ford never really establishes himself here, which is a shame because Def has demonstrated that he can hold his own on the screen. Sam Rockwell's Zaphod has been reduced to an egotistical idiot (he was more self-centered than stupid in the book and miniseries) and begins to grate after a while. Trillian, however, really shines here, and is more interesting and well-rounded than in any previous incarnation. She has a wonderful chemistry with Arthur that has heretofore been wholly missing but really should have been there all along.Though most Adams purists will probably not like the film, I thought it came together pretty well considering the amount of zaniness you have to try and capture while interpreting Adams' work, and the fact that they were condensing a wordy, witty book down into a hundred and ten minutes. This film does offer one thing that no previous incarnation did  a decided ending  and I give it high marks for that. I was also extremely pleased to see several tips of the hat to the miniseries, including brief cameos by Simon Jones and the previous Marvin (who looked a lot cooler than the new ball-headed midget). Hitchhiker's might not be for everyone, but I felt those involved did a worthwhile job bringing an old and well-known classic to the screen. For my money it's worth your time.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

135,Barky44,Possibly the worst film adaptation of a book ever.,3,13 May 2005,"What an absolutely appalling film.Frankly this film makes me angry. Not the ""angry because the filmmakers insulted the intelligence of the audience"" angry, like with ""Armageddon"", but angry because they took a book that is a very clever and funny satire on the foolishness of humanity, and boiled it down into ... well, a very bland, unfunny film that has no point whatsoever.This film is like overcooked vegetables. Vegetables are full of yummy goodness, vitamins and minerals, fiber, everything essential to existence. Yet if you boil them long enough they lose their taste, their texture, and all their nutritional value. Evaporated into a cloud of steam and a pot of murky water.Such is this film: a destruction of Douglas Adams' hilarious account of a Brit pushed into the vastness of space where you can't get a decent spot of tea. The filmmakers have completely missed the point, and created a tragedy, therefore losing the opportunity to spread the genius of Adams' works to a movie-going audience.A horrible film. 3 out of 10.Barky",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
136,deastman_uk,What was the question,2,22 December 2007,"I rarely review a film I saw on TV, because this is not the experience the director intended. But I think I'm giving a better review than I would have done had I paid money.Hitchikers was zen like philosophy, a sort of British geek daydream, an atheists apology. The book is unfilmable in any normal way. The actual narrative is just an aside to all the asides, which are actually the point of the books. Updating the TV show may have made sense, or linking all the asides may have worked. Don't blame Douglas Adams, he gave us the answer to a question no one asked.Instead we have a sort of non event, made by people who saw Brazil once and fancied having a go at film making. Maybe a cute love story at best. Some of the imagery looks right. But you can no more make a film with this then make a statue out of water.There was probably no opportunity missed, just a stirring of the ashes.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
137,extravaluejotter,Douglas Adams may Rest In Peace,7,16 May 2006,"I met Douglas Adams very briefly once, at a book signing for his first non-HitchHikers novel, ""Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency"" in 1987. I asked him whether there would be any more HHGTTG projects. He smiled gently before he said ""I think that 10 years on the same project is long enough."" It was, I think, difficult for Douglas Adams to accept that HHGTTG was the one big thing that people would remember him for, especially at that time. He endured long spells in America in the mid-1980s where he tried to adapt his many previous adaptations of HHGTTG into a Hollywood movie screenplay. His experiences of the studio system at that time were less than favourable, but at least he learned how to scuba dive. He was a talented and intelligent writer and broadcaster, but the enormous success of HHGTTG eclipsed pretty much everything else he turned his hand to. I still feel bad about asking him for more of the same when he clearly felt that he needed to distance himself from the HHGTTG juggernaut.I wish he could have seen this movie because I think that he would have been proud of it. It's taken 20-odd years for CGI special effects to catch up with Adams' imagination, but it was worth the wait. It's not the book or the radio series or the stage version or the album or the TV series (all separate entities in their own ways)but it stands up on its own as a charming and entertaining sci-fi comedy movie.Shame on anyone who knocks this film because Marvin doesn't look like a silver fridge on legs or Zaphod Beeblebrox doesn't have his second head perched on his shoulder like an animatronic parrot. Douglas Adams wouldn't have wanted movie-goers to watch a carbon copy of what had gone before. The producer, scriptwriter and director of the movie were given access to Adams' screenplay notes (which he had continued to work on despite the 1980s knockbacks) by his widow and they deserve credit for their achievement. Douglas Adams was less than happy with the low-budget look of the BBC TV version of HHGTTG, although he had to accept that some of his wilder visual concepts just wouldn't work. For instance, his original TV concept for Marvin the Paranoid Android was a gold-painted actor in a gold leotard. Alan J W Bell, the TV series director, had to point out that (a) this wasn't as funny as a big clunky silver box on legs and (b) there was already a famous gold robot by the name of C3PO in Star Wars.Despite having worked as a script editor and writer on BBC TV's Doctor Who series, Adams the radio and novel maestro seemed to struggle with visual media. However, the struggle (and the wait) for a movie version was worth it. Douglas Adams (with post-mortem help from Karey Kirkpatrick and Garth Jennings) has presented movie-goers with another unique vision of his personal galaxy.Having praised its original creator, I DO want to criticise this movie. Trillian didn't get much to do in the original radio series and her role as gooey love interest in the movie is a retrograde step. Zooey Deschanel's flat portrayal doesn't help much either, leaving the only main female character in the movie as little more than an attractive piece of luggage. All in all though, I enjoyed the movie and I'd go to see a sequel. More of the same? No thanks. I prefer the way that the movie has evolved from the original. Wherever he is now, I'm pretty sure that Douglas Adams does too.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
138,Pavel-8,A big thumbs up.,8,16 May 2005,"Looking for a movie that's completely different from the norm? Looking for something in which you can't anticipate every twist and turn of the plot? Looking for an off-the-wall comedy with little like it anywhere? Then this is the movie for you.Based on Douglas Adams' well-known book (which I haven't read), ""The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"" takes the science fiction genre, turns it on its head, and throws in a dash of light romance. The audience is placed in the shoes of everyman Brit Arthur Dent (Martin Freeman), whose friend Ford (Mos Def) yanks him into an extraterrestrial world he never knew existed. Along the way, he encounters people ranging from aliens to the president of the galaxy to a manic depressive robot. This cast of characters (an appropriate word indeed) inject humor and adventure into the trip through their antics and actions, which result in an unusual but enjoyable ride for those who can handle a film that is willing to defy modern comedy conventions.Guide isn't played for comedy, in the sense a typical Adam Sandler or Will Ferrell movie is. Neither is it as droll as Christopher Guest's work (""This is Spinal Tap"", ""Waiting for Guffman"", etc.). Somewhere in between is this striking mix of comic timing (What are cows?), odd characters (um...all of them), and non-sensible occurrences (sundry). In a single word, the book and film will no doubt be pigeonholed as random, but that is too narrow a definition. The film is nothing like the non sequitur nature of ""Napoleon Dynamite"", even though many unorthodox portions will seem haphazard initially. Taken in context, however, most everything makes sense by the end if not within minutes. This ability to creatively rationalize seemingly incongruous comments and events is the most remarkable thing about ""Guide"". I went in expecting a fully random movie that didn't necessarily make sense, but I left after watching a film that somehow united what could have been helter-skelter calamities into a cohesive story.Aiding that process are the very impressive visual and physical effects. They don't wow you ""Matrix""-style or bombard you like the new ""Star Wars"" movies. Instead they blend in with the story, not standing out or drawing undue attention. You might not even notice them while watching the film, but then you realize how much simply had to be computer-generated. Additionally, the choice of using costumed actors as the aliens was also a wise decision, and gave a physical reality to the universe, which cinema too often portrays as too otherworldly. Both versions of special effects do their jobs, which is to unobtrusively tell the story, and that is perhaps the highest compliment possible for an effects team.Without a solid crew of actors, the excellent source material could easily have been destroyed in delivery. But they heed advice doled out within the movie, and don't panic. Most of them are veteran thespians, and that ability to remain consistent and steady in an otherwise insane world grounds the film. This makes it more accessible and less ridiculous, a profound feat considering the askance view of life that ""Guide"" takes.That oblique stance, which clearly stems from Adams himself, entrenches itself from the opening sequence, which features singing dolphins (seriously). This first scene warns and prepares you for the rest of the movie, and five minutes in, you'll know whether or not you'll enjoy the movie.I loved the opener, and greatly enjoyed the entire film, grinning and chuckling throughout, with bursts of laughing-induced tears mixed in. I am not a big fan of cinematic humor as a whole, but Guide is the best pure live-action comedy I can remember since ""Men in Black"".Bottom Line: Highly recommended for those with a healthy sense of humor. 8 of 10.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
139,grumpy-3,a very major let down,1,26 April 2005,"well its been a long wait and all for nothing, this is everything the film should not be, badly made, loud and bombastic, and mostly wrongly cast, freeman is just not right, rickmans voice is good but not in a body of a four foot round robot, also he and everyone else speaks to fast, that's one of the major problems is the pace is too fast. there is no sense of story/characters/involvement. i do not believe adams would have approved he held out all his life, ever wonder why. the director has no idea of how to construct a movie. the invented bit of trillion getting captured by the vogons is a complete waste of time. the opening song supposedly sung by the dolphins has to be one of the worst songs written. and the ending is beyond belied. there are one or two decent bits but they are far outweighed by the overall badness and misconception of this sorry enterprise",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
140,w00f,Don't Panic; It's Pretty Good,8,30 April 2005,"I should preface what I'nm about to write by saying that hardcore Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy book purists probably won't like the movie version as much as I did. It does change certain elements of the story. If you're the sort of person who has read Douglas Adams' book 27 times and can quote them verbatim, it may not be worth your time to see the movie if you don't think you can go in with an open mind.Having said that, this movie does have a lot to speak in its favor.It's about as faithful to the book as most Hollywood movies are to whatever book they might be based upon. Douglas Adams' wit does come through during the entirety of the film, however, so fans won't be disappointed on that count. The story still carries a punch of combined observational humor and sheer madness, and it stands up as a parody of humanity and our views about ourselves and our place in the universe. It got the same terrific irreverence toward religion and social convention that has long made the story a favorite among the slightly off-kilter set. Even here in Tallahassee, provincial though it may be, I saw any number of people waiting in line with their towels in place, dolphin t-shirts, and anything else that you might expect HGTTG fans to cart along with them.The acting was good overall, though a little uneven in spots. Martin Freeman makes for a perfect Arthur Dent, pulling off a characterization rife with clumsiness and bewilderment without ever going over the top in the bits of physical humor associated with the character. Mos Def is adequate as Ford Prefect, though not remarkable in any way. He tends to blend into the background after the first few scenes of the film, though he does get a couple of good lines which he delivers in workmanlike style. Zooey Deschanel is good at Trillian, though for some reason that character stands as the most eviscerated in the translation of book to film. Here, she is no longer a brilliant mathematician; she's just a girl that Zaphod picked up at a party, and she only serves as a love interest for Dent and Zaphod. I don't know why it was necessary to change this one character so drastically, but there you have it. The voice of Alan Rickman is perfect in the part of Marvin the Paranoid Android.As far as I'm concerned, though, the entire movie was stolen by Sam Rockwell as Zaphod Bebblebrox, and I suppose that's only fitting. Rockwell plays Beeblebrox as a sort of cross between Tom Cruise and George Bush. Zaphod has a bit of a Texas twang and speaks in the exact cadence of Dubya, and there were lines inserted into the dialog that played up his connection to the latter. I thought this was one of the most brilliant aspects of the film. Zaphod smiles when Dubya would smile, has many of the same facial expressions and, as he goes through the much of the film with only half a brain, about the same level of intellect. It's such an obvious thing that I'd be surprised if right wing pundits don't point to this skewering as further evidence of liberal conspiracies and tar the film as anti-American... which it is indeed, though it's just as much anti-British and anti-everyothernationality, too. The point of the whole story, after all, is that we humans are doomed by our own navel-gazing, our hubris, and our refusal to turn our eyes outward to things much bigger than ourselves and our own petty interests on a very tiny planet in an outlying district of a very big galaxy.I haven't mentioned John Malkovich as Hummer Kavula yet. I haven't read the books in many years, but as I recall, Kavula doesn't make his appearance until the second of the five-book trilogy. He shows up in the film, however. Malkovich is terrificly creepy as, well, whatever Kavula is. In one of the films funniest scenes, we find Kavula leading a religious service for a sort of galactic church built on the idea that the universe was created by a sneeze. This is followed shortly thereafter with some true creepiness. I'm sure we'll be seeing more of Malkovich in the sequel, Restaurant at the End of the Universe.The special effects were great. They still have a bit of a cheezy feel, but they've come a long way from the old TV series. The Vogons are quite convincing, and they remind me most of 19th century caricatures of British politicians. They're played here as a race that's so utterly compelled by bureaucracy that they can't say no to a properly filled-out form; it's like garlic for vampires, only in reverse. They look rubbery and sweaty at the same time that they look proper in their fashion. I can't think of a better way to pull of the notion of ""not evil, just incredibly unpleasant"" than as it was done in this movie.All in all, it was quite a good film, I thought. I certainly had a good time and more than a couple of laughs. The opening theme is still going around in my head, too... dolphins bidding their farewell to earth in the form of a song from an old musical. Brilliant stuff, this.Don't miss it. Take it with a grain of salt (and wasn't that the point of the books, anyhow?), but see it.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
141,diand_,Anarchy in the UK,1,19 July 2005,"The preview I saw of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy showed almost nothing about the movie itself. In this way they unintentionally acknowledged that it is hard to translate the books and radio broadcasts to the big screen. But it would also immediately make clear that this is one of the worst movies ever made.As the books are unconventional in form and content, a conventional movie was no option. So they had to place this somewhere else in the movie universe. Instead of mixing different styles, which could have worked, they rely mostly on absurd humor served to you with an anarchistic tone. The movie is quintessential British, but this is not Python at work. The actors are helpless and clumsy here with the material; the director doesn't have a visual clue where it's going and works by the numbers. There are several (intended?) continuity problems.It has cheap production values, laughable sets and an irritating soundtrack. The first cartoon intermezzo was somewhat funny, but they become so repetitious (like many jokes in the movie) that you lose interest soon. A missed opportunity is also that further mapping of the characters to living groups on earth would extend beyond the Vogons as bureaucrats and Humma Kavula as religious leader.One plus is the funny beginning, when earth is destroyed for a galactic highway whereas Dent's home is also under threat from a highway on earth. And when a back-up earth is made there are some funny scenes like filling the ocean with water.It seems the audience was totally forgotten when making this. To sit through this is torture. Half the cinema was empty at the end. You can't say I haven't warned you.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

The radio had 12 episodes but the TV series only ran to the first 6. There was a wonderful dry wit that Peter Jones gave to the original series as the narrator plus the entire script was peppered with absolute original gems.This film has none of that – some overpaid nerds with zero sense of humour have hacked through the original treasure and removed everything of value and replaced it with nerdish, unfunny dross.Leave this alone – watch the original and enjoy, again and again.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

144,MetalGeek,"Thanks for all the fish, Douglas...",7,9 August 2010,"I read the five books in Douglas Adams' ""Hitchhiker's Guide"" trilogy (yes, you read that right) numerous times during my high school and college years, and back in '05 I was excited to hear that a big-budget, big-screen adaptation was in the works after spending 20+ years in Development Hell. Sadly, Douglas did not live to see his creation make the leap to the cinema (he did, however, work on the first few drafts of the film script), but fortunately the filmmakers did their very best to honor his vision.For fans of the Hitchhiker saga, the film does not stick closely to the novel's ""plot"" (if the novels could even be said to have a ""plot""), having quite a few new bits added and a lot of bits removed, but it's still a fast, funny, action packed, eye popping piece of work. Martin Freeman is perfect as the eternally befuddled Arthur Dent, who starts the movie trying to stop a British road crew from bulldozing his house to make way for a highway bypass. His friend Ford Prefect (rapper Mos Def) arrives to report an even bigger problem: the Earth is about to be destroyed by the Vogons, a particularly ugly race of alien bureaucrats. Fortunately, Ford happens to be a field reporter for the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, an interstellar tourist Bible, and using his electronic ""thumb"" he's able to get himself and Arthur off the planet just before it explodes. (Entries from The Guide, a ""wholly remarkable book,"" appear on screen throughout the film as hilarious animated bits.) From there we meet Zaphod Beeblebrox (an awesomely over-the-top Sam Rockwell), the two-headed, three-armed dunderhead who dresses like a rock star and happens to also be President of the Galaxy, and Tricia McMillan (aka ""Trillian,' played by the gorgeous Zooey Deschanel), when Ford and Arthur ""hitch a ride"" on their starship, the ""Heart of Gold."" Zaphod has stolen the Heart of Gold and wants to use its Infinite Improbability Drive to get him to the ancient planet of Magrathea, where he hopes to learn the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything from the planet's computer, Deep Thought. (He needs to know the question because everyone already knows, but doesn't understand, the answer - 42.) If this sounds really REALLY random, well, it is. And I haven't even gotten into Humma Kavula (John Malkovich), ruler of the Jartravartid people of Viltvodle VI and Ford's political rival, the pot of petunias that thinks, ""Oh, no...not again"" as it plummets to its death, the all-powerful mice, or the massive Planet Factory on Magrathea where Earth was built. To try and explain all of this would take much more than IMDb's 1000 word limit for reviews, so let's just say there's a LOT going on in this movie.Performances are excellent (special mention must be made of Alan Rickman's fine voice work as Marvin, the Paranoid Android), the sets and special effects are extremely well done, and the respect for Douglas' work shines throughout this production. It may not follow the novel to the absolute letter (in fact, quite a bit has been changed, which really ticked off the purists back in '05) but honestly, if they'd tried to truly ""adapt"" the book it probably would've been an impossible task.While ""The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"" was a fun ride for this longtime fan, I feel that the film is best reserved for those who are familiar with Adams' skewed universe. Those who haven't read the novels or seen/heard any of the previous TV and radio versions may find themselves utterly lost within 30 minutes of the movie. I get the feeling that newcomers to the saga may have felt like they were watching a very lavish private joke that they were not ""in on,"" and this may explain the film's under-performance at the box office. Still, adventurous Sci-Fi fans with a taste for the silly may want to give this ""Guide"" a shot. Just don't forget to bring your towel.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
145,samseescinema,A success in that it is simply the book brought to film,8,1 May 2005,"The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy (2005) reviewed by Sam Osborn rating: 3 out of 4The film version of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy works on the same level as the books: hilarious in its haphazard randomness and never-ending British wit. If you haven't read the books and are looking for a coherent narrative comedy, look elsewhere. This film version is a wonderfully faithful adaptation of the book. So if you hated the book you'll no doubt hate the movie and vice-versa. Where this advisement hits a grey area is for the audiences who never read the book. Because Hitchhiker is such a unique story, it's impossible to predict whether you'll enjoy it or not. I went with Hitchhiker virgins and they enjoyed it, but that can be reduced to their personality and taste in film. So, if you've never read the book, I can't honestly recommend this film to you. You might hate it or you might love it. Who knows? Either way, Don't Panic!It all begins with the destruction of Arthur Dent's home to make way for a bypass. Dent (Martin Freeman) wakes up to an army of bulldozers waiting in front of his house, anxious for demolition. While laying in front of a bulldozer in protest, Arthur's friend Ford Prefect (Mos Def) runs up with a cart-full of alcohol. Ford informs him that Earth, along with Arthur's house, is also scheduled for demolition to make way for a Vorgon inter-galactic bypass. Seconds before Earth's destruction, the two hitch a ride on one of the thousands of Vorgon spaceships hovering about our atmosphere and begin their adventure around the galaxy in search ofwell, nothing really.This is what will pinch the nerves of many traditional film critics: there's no plot to Hitchhiker. The film does exactly what the title says: Hitchhike. We're brought to every end of the galaxy according to the whims of each character introduced. The fun is in simply sitting down and watching the show, because every character, world, spaceship, and language is worth watching. Adams and Director Garth Jennings have created a world unmatched in creativity. We're first taken to the Vorgon spaceship, where Ford and Arthur are tortured by the third worst poetry in the world, a ranking beaten only by an foreign alien race and a couple from Sussex, England. We're then whisked away to the Heart of Gold spaceship that's been stolen by the President of the Galaxy, Zaphod Beeblebrox (Sam Rockwell). Along for the ride is fellow Earthling Trillian (Zooey Deschanel), who's Earth name was formerly Trisha McMillan, and the ever-depressed robot Marvin (Warwick Davis). To make up for Marvin's negativity, the onboard computer has been programmed to be ever-optimistic, even in the worst of circumstances (""Hey gang! Hate to interrupt the fun, but we've got two thermo-nuclear missiles comin' our way!""), and the doors emit a relaxing sigh every time they open or close. Zaphod's goal is to find the question to the answer of Life, the Universe, and Everything, which, of course, is 42. So, he must find his way to the planet Morgantheon, which may prove difficult because mice have eaten the onboard navigating system, eliminating all hyperspace coordinates. His solution is to just launch the Heart of Gold into hyperspace and hope it takes them to the right planet. And so on and so forth. The film honestly has no narrative structure to it. And although that's completely fine by me, some will feel there's something lacking. But if you fall under this category, you're simply missing the point of Hitchhiker. There isn't supposed to be a narrative holding this film together. What holds it together is its amazing creativity and humor. 2005 is just the right time to adapt Hitchhiker. CGI prowess has reached a level of near perfect realism, and is finally used in nearly every film. Jenning's has decided to faithfully adapt the book, and the only way to truly pull this off, is to use hundreds of CGI shots. Hitchhiker simply wouldn't work without technology. That's really the beauty of this film adaptation: it feels like the book. Many feared that the film would simply use the book as a foundation and go off in its own direction. Alas, it doesn't. Garth Jennings has stayed true to the material and done his very best to make it simply into a visual representation of the novel. The casting is spot on, the screenplay is for the most part faithful, and the visuals match what every reader imagined them to be. Hitchhiker is a success in that it is simply the book brought to film. The flaws of the book are still there, but if you don't much care about narrative direction, it won't matter. The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is still the wackiest, most fun you'll have this April.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

149,blackburnj-1,So much better than a Pan-Galactic gargle-blaster,7,30 April 2005,"And so, after thirty years of waiting, Douglas Adams' magnum opus (mark 5 or 6, I think), has made it to the big screen. It was undoubtedly a daunting task for first time director, Garth Jennings, to bring this seminal comedic work to the cinema, but he has achieved this with incredible style and panache. It's hard to imagine a version of this work without Simon and Peter Jones in it, but the cast of Martin Freeman (Arthur Dent), the controversial Mos Def (Ford Prefect), Sam Rockwell (Zaphod Beeblebrox) and Stephen Fry (The Book) manage to create a vibrant world of wonderful comic characters. Freeman's performance is brilliant. It is bemused and yet filled with brilliant comic talent. Mos Def is superb. He takes on a difficult challenge well and creates a new and brilliant version of Ford Prefect. Sam Rockwell takes on a difficult part with aplomb and manages to get the right balance between annoying bastard and, almost pathos evoking, idiot. While Stephen Fry carries out his task with equal brilliance, and we mustn't forget Alan Rickman as Marvin, the paranoid android, who is just brilliant, or Bill Nighy who is fantastically funny as Slartibartfast. However, Zooey Deschanel (Trillian), is the weak link. She is monotone and rarely shows any change in her performance apart from the occasional insightful facial expression. Meanwhile, Jennings creates a world rich in depth and vibrant in colour that is both weird and beautiful. The stage design is befitting to Adams' descriptions and epic. Igor Jadue-Lillo's cinematography is beautiful and interacts supremely well with the wonderfully stylised effects and the rest of the film remains wonderfully, technically proficient. And finally, Adams' posthumous script (co-written with Karey Kirkpatrick), maintains the comic value of the original radio series, whilst changing the storyline brilliantly and creating whole new characters and worlds with his dazzling and remarkable imagination. In short, the film is a wonderful comic masterpiece, which is a dazzling spectacle and a beautiful, grand and epic vision.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

152,garethvk,A disaster of Epic Porportions.,1,28 April 2005,"Making films from books has always been a tricky proposition. For every film adaptation that hits it big such as ""Jaws"" ""Lord of the Rings"" and ""The Silence of the Lambs"", there are several that fail to work or are downright disasters such as ""The Bonfire of the Vanities"". In the film ""The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"", the late Douglas Adams first book in his classic series has finally arrived on the big screen after many delays getting started and a successful version on PBS.The film stars Martin Freeman as Arthur Dent, a simple, easy going fellow whose entire goal in life is to stop the demolition of his beloved home from those who want to put a new highway in its current location.As Arthur attempts to block the demolition, his good friend Ford Prefect (Mos Def), arrives and stalls the demolition with free beer for the work crew. Thinking he has been saved, Arthur is puzzled when Ford takes him to a local pub and buys rounds for the entire pub, saying the world is ending in a few minutes. Ford in reality is an alien visiting the Earth and learns that the Earth is about to be destroyed to make way for a new galactic expressway. Before he knows what has happened, Arthur is whisked away seconds before the destruction of the Earth by Ford as they end up on a ship of the demolition fleet.After a series of bizarre events and a narrow escape, Ford and Arthur end up on a passing ship that has been stolen by galactic president Zaphod Beeblebrox (Sam Rockwell), and Trillian (Zooey Deschanel), who just happens to be the lady of Arthur's dreams and who is also unaware that the Earth has been destroyed in the short amount of time since she left Earth to explore with Zaphod.As if this was not enough, the ship also has a depressed android named Marvin (Warwick Davis and voiced by Allan Rickman),It is at this point that the film goes horribly wrong as the amusing and interesting setup quickly goes nowhere. While the crew is sent on a series of quests, each becomes less interesting than the one before it, and the very bland production values of the film are exposed. The sets are very basic and look as if they were borrowed from many of the budget driven British Sci-Fi that frequents PBS. Somehow the idea of an alien room being nothing but a rusty wall and a slapped up sign just does not cut it for me. At times I thought I was watching a home video production done by fans or another late night B movie rather than a major studio summer release. As bad as the sets were what is even more amazing was the at times laughable attempts at visual effects where it was obvious that the actors were standing in front of screens as the matting lines were visible. I tried to put a lot of this off to the idea that the film was trying to be quirky in keeping with the book, but quirky is not an excuse for underwhelming effects, basic sets, and lousy costuming and make up effects as I half expected to see zippers on the costumes of many aliens that looked like they were cobbled from parts at a hardware store.So now that I have covered my issues with the look of the film, let's look at the story itself, in a word, boring. I could not believe how dull and lazy the film became, and how the staff seemed to be going through the motions. The cast has zero chemistry and Rockwell is so frantic that his character is annoying to watch. After five minutes of his rock star in the spotlight style shtick, I wanted to strangle the character or at least get him on some serious medication.Director Garth Jennings also has many scenes that simply go nowhere or drag on only to cut at odd times resulting in a complete and utter lack of pacing.I am a big fan of the book series and I had very high hopes for this film. Sadly the disaster that resulted may very well have Douglas Adams spinning in his grave as his classic work was destroyed. I have to wonder how much of his original draft for the script that was used as the basis for the film survived. While extreme die hard fans may enjoy the film, even they are likely to be disappointed and I can only hope that if they try to make the next book in the series, ""The Restaurant at the End of the Universe"", they do a much better job then this effort, as this is one awful film adaptation. 1 star out of 5 Gareth Von Kallenbah",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

The ""So Long"" song was bizarre, true, but I was able to relax into it and accept it.STEPHEN FRYFry's voice was perfectly acceptable and non-intrusive as the Book, but I felt that they didn't really know how to treat the book, just throwing Fry in wherever it suited them. The visuals were fine, however.MARTIN FREEMANAs always suspected, they could hardly have done better.EARLY SCENESAfter the dolphins, they really wanted to keep the diehards onside. Prosser and the bulldozer - check. The pub - check, with dialogue almost unaltered. Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz - check. It would go on to alter existing plot lines rather more, but this is a familiar and successful start to the film.MOS DEFMm. he just didn't work for me. I thought he's be good, but I felt he just didn't quite have a handle on the character. he's not just a slightly odd person with a towel fixation.DESIGNNow this is where, for me, the film really scored. Vogon ships? Marvin? Zooming around Magrathea? The Heart of Gold? This film is the most visually perfect film I have seen in a while, and deserves awards of some sort.THE DESTRUCTION OF EARTHOh yes. How good was that!ZOOEY DESCHANELI was really pleased with her. Never heard of her before, but she was just right. A bit alien-esquire, a bit human, a bit cute. A great piece of casting. Unlike...SAM ROCKWELLEurgh. The film's major failing for me. He was just too goddamn zany. I think this role should be played as a wannabe-cool Hollywood star (Nic Cage for example) which Rockwell could have done, but instead we got Jim Carrey on acid. The two-heads gimmick didn't work for me, sorry. I felt Zaphod ruined almost every scene he was in.MARVINAs already mentioned, I thought he looked tremendous. Alan Rickman did a good job, too, but I did pine for Stephen Moore a bit. Oh, that reminds me...QUESTULARAnna Chancellor pops in from period drama-land to play the vice-President of the Galaxy, who apparently fancies Zaphod. Er, why, exactly? This whole role felt to me like a remnant from an earlier script. She had nothing to do except react in a startled way to Vogons and the films could have managed quite well without her.HUMMA KAVULAAnd the same goes for this guy.I think the main problem with HHG the movie is this. It's adapted from a book that was adapted from four half-hour radio shows. It's already therefore crammed with quite enough incident - Earth destroyed, Vogon poetry, the Heart of Gold, Magrathea, Deep Thought, mice - without sticking more in! Inserting the scenes on Viltvodle and Vogsphere did nothing but extend the running time and make it more and more confusing. I could happily skip these tracks on the DVD. Especially the rather odd planet of the fly swatters.MAGRATHEAThe scenes on Magrathea, especially those with Slartibartfast, were a definite highlight for me. Nighy portrays Slarti as a somewhat harassed and ineffectual civil servant and it's a great performance. The effects sequences as Arthur and Slarti shoot around the new Earth are quite staggeringly wonderful. Ending the whole thing at Arthur's house is inspired and very filmic but a little forced perhaps.LUNKWILL AND FOOKThe Deep Thought scenes - visually, much better than on TV. I love the crowds. I love the idea of using children as computer programmers and I love that they look like mice. I miss Majikthise and Vroomfondel, but you can't have everything. Similarly, it makes total sense to use Vogons for the final shootout instead of Shooty and Bang Bang. IS SHE THE ONE?I felt that the predictable romantic subplot was one of the film's weaker elements. Include it, fine, but don't do it in such a yuchy way. Ooh, that reminds me of a scene I really did like...THE POINT OF VIEW GUNThis could have been a really hokey and pointless concept, but when Trillian turned it on Zaphod it worked really well. Zaphod is forced to exposit all of Trillian's inner turmoil and the look on Deschanel's face says it all. A great piece of writing and acting.MARVIN SAVES THE DAY!Well, why not.All told, then. Yes, I liked it. It's not as good as the radio series, the TV series or the book (although the ""Restaurant at the other end of the Universe"" joke is a better ending than the book had). But it's still pretty good. As good an adaptation as I could have expected, really.I'll give it 7/10.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
154,JimD73,It Doesn't Take A Fan of the Novel To See The Merit of THGTTG,8,2 May 2005,"For the record, I never read the book. Nor had I heard about it until this movie was announced.PLOT: 15/20: Arthur Dent (Freeman) is having a very bad day. He woke up in the morning to find a demolition crew in front of his house, ready to bulldoze his home down. It only gets worse. His best friend Ford Prefect (Def) shows up and tells him that the Earth is about to be demolished to make room for a new intergalactic expressway. Ford is an alien researcher who is helping to make a new section of the interplanetary bestseller The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. They hitch a ride on a Volgon destroyer ship, which are being used to demolish Earth, but the Volgons are a bunch of humourless bureaucrats, and they pitch the two hitchhikers into the depths of space. They are then picked up by Zaphod Beeblebrox (Rockwell), the sleazy and stupid two-headed President of the Universe and his assistant, Marvin the Manically Depressed Robot (voice of Rickman). Beeblebrox happened to pick up Arthur's recently ex-girlfriend Tricia (Deschanel), who has renamed herself Trillian and is unaware of Earth's destruction. While the Volgons chase down the four of them, under the impression that they kidnapped the President, Beeblebrox goes on his own quest to find the ultimate answer.At first, the plot seems very fast and intriguing. It slows down eventually, but it is still pretty good, considering the fact this is a pretty stupid movie. The only thing that drags it down here a little is the love story between Trillian and Arthur. It seems too forced, never really showing us why these two people should have anything to do with each other; saving the fact they may be the last two humans alive. Regardless, the rest of the plot is interesting enough, stupid enough and weird enough.COMEDY: 16/20: This is the type of movie you sit through the whole time and just have a good chuckle as all insanity erupts in front of you. There are some wonderfully clever bits in here, such as the planet in which they worship the coming a giant handkerchief to wipe their lord's nose or having the characters briefly turn to sofas after going into hyperspace. Guaranteed, the favourite character will be Marvin the Manically Depressed Robot. With Rickman's spot-on voice work, it is hard not to immediately love the character. There is also a nice little conflict on the ship between Marvin and the overly optimistic CPU of the ship. As much as we all love Marvin, he is more there to keep the audience from getting bored during some sequences rather than produce any real laughs. Most of the real laughs that we get here are from the rather stupid humour, such as a desert plain that slaps the protagonists randomly. Such moments are rare, and most of the movie will have you chuckling quietly to yourself. However, it will keep up that chuckling for a straight 110 minutes.SCI-FI: 17/20: The universe created by THGTTG is not as complicated as one might hope, but it benefits from being much simpler to comprehend than most sci-fi mumbo-jumbo out there. The Guide will pop up now and then and explain stuff about the universe to keep the audience completely in the loop, even if they had never read the novel.The one thing that will remain remembered, though, is the seemingly random hyperspace drive, which, while travelling, changes the ships and anything inside them into random objects, such as sofas, rag dolls, or a bowl of petunias. It's a great idea executed quite well.While the worlds may not be as intricate as some others previously invented, they get the job done by being easy to follow and being just plain funny.ACTING: 18/20: To start out, let me say again that Alan Rickman (Die Hard) is flat-out brilliant as the voice of Marvin. There is not a single other voice that could fit that suicidal tone quite so good.Martin Freeman (""The Office"") is a fairly good Arthur, but the role is plain enough that he fits it just fine. Def (The Italian Job) is somewhat off as Ford Prefect, bringing nothing exceptional to the role and seeming too dull for the most part. Deschanel (Elf) is once again rather laid back and deadpan, but she also has a certain flair that makes her fit right in the role.The stand out from the main human performances is Sam Rockwell (Galaxy Quest). He is a great mix of insanity, sleaziness and stupidity needed for Beeblebrox's character. While he can seem uncomfortable when he has to don his second head, such instances are rare and Rockwell is just plain funny.There are a few cameos, the best of which is John Malkovich (Being John Malkovich). Not anything against Bill Nighy (Shaun of the Dead) or Richard Griffiths (Harry Potter), who also have good appearances.The acting is overall quite good.ENTERTAINMENT: 16/20: This is a movie I can safely recommend for almost everyone to like in some regards. It has a large enough imagination for the sci-fi freaks, but is clear enough for normal viewers. It may not be gut-bustingly funny, but it has you chuckling the whole time. You do not have to know anything about the novel or TV series to appreciate this movie. It isn't guaranteed to please everyone, but is amusing enough for a definite rental.TOTAL: 82%: The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy doesn't push it's limits, but manages to be a very amusing sci-fi comedy that is weird enough to fulfill those seeking something new. It doesn't take a fan of the novel to see that.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
155,thniels,I have this to say about the Guide saying that about the filming of the Guide,6,3 March 2006,"Mindboggingly hilarious! In the nicest meaning of the phrase as well as the worst. First of all the film does the book some justice but what it doesn't is bring out the story as well as the books do. ""Hey""! Some would say. ""Douglas was, after all, involved""! True. But he also wrote the fifth and absolutely uncalled for ""Mostly Harmless"" in his otherwise wonderful trilogy of four. That is no excuse for cutting down the story so much. Almost none of the explanations as to why our friends do what they do are present in the film. Why is ""the button"" so dangerous. I suspect most of those who haven't read the book(s) found that one particularly confusing. And the tea?! Why didn't Eddie do something? like, help Arthur (and be part of the plot)? Having The Guide pop up and explain for 1/3 of the film doesn't quite make up for this. Coming to think of it. The Guide popping up is sort of a novelty in a movie - isn't it? In fact I liked it a lot. But NOT enough to excuse the reason why it did so.Now. The acting was good. Or rather, it was to the point. Well, it was acting as defined by Eric Idle and his chums. Not very good, but very very well placed and the lack of it humorous in its own right.I bought it on DVD and will be watching it on and off for years to come. But it is hardly going to suffer the same wear the books have over the past almost 20 years. After all, The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy is a work of words. It is the unusual mastery of the English language that Douglas Adams put to print which makes the books so truly remarkable. So - not only will reading the books make your life richer and more in pact with nature, it will also help a lot understanding this movie.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
156,daveisit,Moving Rapidly,6,5 May 2005,"Having never read, heard or seen anything to do with the ""The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"", I was prepared for this film to be anything. There has been a lot of talk about the movie resembling the Monty Python sense of humour and comedy. Whilst there were obvious similarities, I don't believe it was quite strong enough nor contain frequent enough laughs to totally warrant this comparison. What I did like was the not too serious attempt to bring an almost impossible galaxy to the big screen. The lighthearted approach allowed the viewer to relax into the characters and imagine the possibilities of such a life and existence. The casting was pretty good, with Martin Freeman, Stephen Fry, John Malkovich and Alan Rickman spot on. Perhaps only Zooey Deschanel appeared to struggle a little with the role.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
157,rstef1,I Didn't Panic...,6,22 November 2005,"At least not at first. But then the reports started coming in on the film and I became quite worried. I'm no expert on the Douglas Adams' novel, but I did thoroughly enjoy the British mini-series as a child, so I had high hopes for the big screen movie version. Sadly, I was disappointed in the results. The whimsy and cleverness of the earlier adaptation are missing here. Although the mini-series was done with far less money, it was more inventive and amusing than this big budget waste of time and talent. While I did appreciate some of the expensive special effects (the world creation factory in particular), some of the effects, notably the title guide, seemed quite cheap. Though I like Jim Henson's workshop characters, I didn't particularly care for the Vogons. I couldn't get past the ""guy in a rubber suit"" feeling they gave off. The crabs on the other hand were a winner; I would have liked to see more of their story.Also, the actors rarely seemed to get into the spirit of the production, with the exception of Bill Nighy as Slartibartfast. He lent a grace note to the proceedings which was not present before he appeared far too late into the film to salvage it. Martin Freeman is adequate as Arthur, though Simon Jones did worlds better with the part. Mos Def and Zooey Deschanel aren't given a lot to do, and what they get they don't do much with. As for Sam Rockwell's performance, well, he leaves very little scenery undigested and comes off as annoying rather than excusably irascible, adventurous or fun. Frankly, I just never cared about what happened to any of the leads, which pretty much dooms any picture.Though I was never bored or angry about renting this, my advice is to check out the original British version, and leave this one for a time when there's nothing else to rent at the video store.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

But one good thing about the day is his friend Ford Prefect. But Ford tells him something very strange, Ford tells him that he is a alien from outer space, and earth is about to be demolished.

I never read the books, however I am a fan of sci-fi and comedy this movie does what many do not it entertains. Lets begin with the witty narrative, which in my view is well written and executed through out the film without becoming intrusive or trite. The actors are more than able to handle the complexities of the script delivering great lines and Mos Def does a good acting job. Perfeclty cast is Sam Rockwell and Alan Rickman as the voice of the droid-Marvin is totally hilarious. I laughed through out the film and so did the rest of the audience, a major accomplishment living in Texas, where sometimes people just don't get it. There are many site gags, jokes within jokes and did I already say very good special FX. I cannot understand why some people don't approach movies made from books as a separate animal altogether, there is so much description in a book that is visual in a movie, complexities of transforming a book to screen and remaining true to the source material is not easy...I gave this movie an 8 out of 10 after watching the DVD so I have seen the movie twice...to quote Marvin ""I could tell you...but you wouldn't like it""",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

I don't think that even die hard fans of the books would be entertained by this movie. This story is better as a work of literature, I think, instead of an adaption into a movie. They should have left this one alone, and I should have not gone to the theater. Now, you might say that I am voicing ONLY my opinion, that this movie sucks...well, that is true, however, let me tell you that MOST of the other people in the theatre I was in WALKED OUT. I have NEVER seen such a mass exodus from a movie. People were bored to tears, so they got up and left, mostly about half way through. There is no coincidence that so many people left after half the movie was done. By the time you get half way through Hitchhiker's guide, it is quite obvious that the movie is not going to get any better. I watched people walking out with sleepy eyes and I ENVIED them! I wanted to leave so bad, but I suffered through to the end. What a total waste of time. Don't go see this boring, horrible, slow, agonizing movie!",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

Garth Jennings mercilessly (psycologically, of course) beats the late Douglas Adams into creating a film so truly original, no book could ever guide it. Jennings had a vision, and just about everything about it was correct.Arthur (Martin Freeman- the office) just wants to sit in his quiet little country home and drink tea. That is, until he finds news of a new bypass, that is! His mate Ford Prefect hatches them onto a ride, one of the many massive ships covering the world, sadly run by terrible (but superbly done) creatures: Vogons.To cut short, this film works so well because it is truly wacky, and, at parts, truly hilarious.

162,WCS02,. . . 100% fun.,8,1 May 2005,"Hitchhiker is every bit the Tour de'Fun that ""Men in Black"" was 8 years ago. Just when the human ego starts thinking it's really King of the Universe, a film like Hitchhiker comes along to slap us back to reality, to properly appreciate our relative relationship to the universe. Few things put life into perspective like a great, philosophical comedy.In the opening sequence, for example, protagonist Arthur Dent's biggest problem becomes dwarfed by the identical problem on a far grander scale. It is done with Monty Python's smart style. It's (literally at times) a roller coaster ride in the amusement park called life.The meaning of life is explored, answered, questioned and confusing ... in that order, all in less than 2 hours. Great characters, voices, caricatures, all wrapped up in a plot that held my attention tenaciously. 100% fun.Seriously: Don't take everything so seriously. Enjoy the ride, during the movie and afterward in the real world  and see this film every time you lose sight of the grand scheme of things.Thank you, Douglas Adams.

163,crowrobot,Adams would be proud.,10,30 April 2005,"I am a huge fan of 'The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy', and when I heard they had been trying to make it into a movie for 20 years and had now finally succeeded, I jumped for joy and set my calendar. Well... The movie does not, on any count, disappoint. All fans rejoice! Seriously, this is a fine adaptation of Adams's genius, and no wonder: He wrote the screenplay just before he died. Another writer, Karey Kirkpatrick, was brought on to reportedly ""fine-tune"" the screenplay. After about 5 minutes, I gave up trying to find the seams where Adams ended and Kirkpatrick began because I knew it would end in madness.Almost everything is here from the book, and there's some cool extra stuff: Humma Kavula (John Malkovich), a religious leader who lost the Presidency of the Galaxy to Zaphod Beeblebrox (Sam Rockwell); a love triangle between Arthur (Martin Freeman), Trillian (Zooey Deschanel) and Zaphod; and a musical number that opens the film. I will let you discover that for yourselves.First-time director Garth Jennings does a great job with all the story streams and wild special effects. Speaking of effects, this movie thankfully does not bury Adams's characters in CGI overload. There are many shots in the film that involve models, puppets, or matte paintings. The best examples of these are the vile Vogons and Marvin the Paranoid Android (voice of Alan Rickman) The Guide itself is treated very well, with Stephen Fry doing an excellent job as the voice of the book. The graphics and animation in the Guide entries are cool, and some of them made me laugh out loud.All this adds up to one of the best book-to-film movies I've ever seen. And at the end, when it's all over, there are two words left on screen: For Douglas. For Douglas indeed.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
164,filmbuff-36,"Interesting, but not worth the hype",6,5 May 2005,"Fair warning: I've never read any of Douglas Adams's ""Hitchhiker"" books, or witnessed the television or radio shows. I went into the showing completely ignorant of any rules or expectations that fans of one of the most popular sci-fi novels of all time would come to demand from a big-screen adaptation of the legendary book.I feel that while that put me at a loss for appreciating the in-jokes the way fans will, it also left me with a better footing to give an unbiased critique. So what did I think of this long-awaited comedy? Meh, it was okay.Arthur Dent (Martin Freeman) is in the middle of a mid-life crisis. Along with having a non-existent love life, his home is scheduled for demolition so that a new highway can be built where it stands. To make matters worse, he finds out his friend Ford Prefect (Mos Def) is actually an alien who was on Earth doing research, and that the planet has been scheduled for destruction by alien beings. Ford whisks him off Earth just as it is destroyed.Circumstances bring the pair into the company of Zaphod Beeblebrox (Sam Rockwell) an egomaniac who happens to be President of the Galaxy, and Trisha ""Trillion"" McMillion (Zooey Deschanel), an Earth woman who Arthur coincidently blew his shot at courting due to Zaphod, who was on Earth by mistake. Also on board is the paranoid robot Marvin (voiced of Alan Rickman) who always looks on the dark side of life. The three are on the run from authorities because Zaphod stole the experimental spaceship Heart of Gold.The group attempts to flee the Vogons, a race of slow-minded intergalactic bureaucrats, while Zaphod plots to take the ship to a near-mythical planet that's home to an ancient supercomputer. The group begins a strange odyssey that involves bad Vogon poetry, the meaning behind different social activities and discovering why 42 is the answer to the most important question in the universe.""The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"" has all the right elements in place for a cult science fiction film. There's the goofy premise, strange worlds and weird gadgets mixed with wacky bits of social commentary. But the movie never gels the right way.Director Garth Jennings keeps the movie going along at a nice pace, but that's part of the problem. Everything happens so quickly that we hardly have time for the characters to show much individual distinction. Special effects and make-up are quite good, especially the Vogons, who are tangible puppets from Jim Henson's Workshop and thankfully not some CGI abomination. Everything looks good.But the movie can't sustain itself. It feels like a lot was lost in the translation to big screen. Either that, or Adams originally wrote the book concerned more with the situations then with the characters. Whatever the case, the movie plays like a series of mildly clever skits of people cruising around the universe. Sometimes it works, but most of the time it seems like the kind of screenplay a group off middle schoolers would have come up with after watching too much ""Monty Python.""Numerous plot threads are created and then abandoned with little rhyme or reason, seemingly introduced to eat up screen time with ill regard for bringing the story to any logical conclusion. The whole production runs out of steam in the third act, despite a fun appearance by Bill Nighy as a contractor who builds planets. The finale is anti-climatic, halting the story, not resolving it.Freeman is nicely restrained as Arthur, and makes a likable enough protagonist. Def is perhaps the best performer on display here, making Ford a believable enough character in these surroundings. Deschanel has little to do as Trillion but play a cliché love interest for Arthur. Rockwell on the other hand manages to be simply annoying in every scene he's in, but given his character that may have been the point. Rickman is the only really funny character here, making Marvin the robot's presence all the more necessary to stave off tedium.So, is this the story that allegedly is so interesting that it's made the novel a worldwide bestseller? Perhaps it's just a funnier tale to read then it is to watch, otherwise the screenplay, cowritten by the late Adams, missed the mark completely. It's fitting that ""Galaxy Quest"" stars Rockwell and Rickman were reunited here, because at times ""Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"" feels more like an unofficial sequel to that movie than an adaptation of a highly famous satirical adventure story. As it is, the movie is nice bit of diversion, but hardly worth all the hype surrounding it.Six out of ten stars. I doubt even fans of Douglas Adams could be overly enthused by this lackluster adaptation of what I assume is a genuinely fun novel to read.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

If you are a MOnty Python fan, then you will probably like it. If you find Monty Python's humor boring, then you will definitely find this movie boring as well. If you have never seen a Monty Python sketch, I can tell you that you are not missing anything. In fact, before paying money to see this movie, rent a Monty Python movie in your video store to make sure you like this type of humor. I am glad I got a free pass to see this movie. I guess the only good thing about seeing this movie was I was able to catch up on my nap.The story was stupid. The acting was fine. The humor was just simply awful. Add all this up and you get a piece of crap! Trust me on this, don't believe the hype, the movie sucks! You have nothing to lose by waiting a couple of months to come out on video; and even that, I would not recommend renting it.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
166,98nurdinm-1,"Good, but not great.",6,16 May 2005,"When Doulas Adams died in 2001, he left behind him a wealth of comic science fiction. The book of ""The Hitchhiker's Guide To the Galaxy"" is a much loved novel, radio show, television series, video game and etc, which, along with its sequels, has spawned a massive fan base; and we're talking massive, here, people.So, basically, they had to get it right when they made the movie. Two things helped them. Firstly, they used notes that Adams himself had written just before his tragically premature death for exactly this purpose.Secondly, I've never read the book before in my life, so I went in with an open mind. This is either a positive or a negative thing. On the whole I found this film quite entertaining, but I felt that there were certain elements that were lacking from the big picture.It started out promisingly, with the subtle tones of the always-dependable Stephen Fry, who plays the Narrator, and the quite random song and dance routine through the opening credits by the dolphins. This randomness just about warns the viewer that he/she/it is about to go into a very weird and random place where weirder and more random stuff than this will occur. the trouble is, the randomness can also be fitted to the moments when I enjoyed the movie the most.Martin Freeman was very good in the main role of Arthur Dent, a role that has certain comparisons to his earlier role in ""The Office"", but also it's differences. We then had a small cameo from one of the League Of Gentlemen as the head builder who has come to knock Dent's house down. This cameo business occurs throughout the movie - on some levels it works, and some it doesn't. I don't think it would work for an American audience, because the stars who do cameo are mostly too well known over here in the UK than over in the States.In fact, and I know I'm gonna get blasted by the Americans when they read this, it was the American people in the film that really didn't work for me. It's as if the story is just too British. It has too much of Adams' trademark charm and Englishness about it for an American actor to really get their grip on. I was disappointed by Mos Def's Ford Prefect, and wasn't too keen on Sam Rockwell's character either, though I've never been a great fan of his. To be fair, I though that Zooey Deschanel was pretty good as the love interest, and you did genuinely feel for her sudden pain and anguish towards the end.As for John Malkovich...The one thing I really think this film was lacking was a strong bad guy. As I've said I haven't read the book, and I probably never will, but for this type of audience the bad guy needs to be there and threatening. Too little was made of Malkovich's character, who started out promising to be an interesting baddie. By the end of the film, when they should have gone to get Rockwell's other head back, they had completely forgotten about him.Another element of the film that too little was made of was the idea of the Ultimate Question & Answer. However, this could be seen as a good thing - after all, they are aiming at family audiences, so they don't want the film to get TOO philosophical. Still I think that young people may not fully understand the concept of 42.The film sagged quite a bit after the first twenty minutes or so, but then with the introduction of Bill Nighy as the Planet Builder, we could sit back and just say ""wow"". If anything, the special effects in this film are spectacular, and the last scenes of the Planet Workshop even more so.Happy ending all around, which was nice, though, like Malkovich, Stephen Fry's Narrator/Hitchhiker's Guide Voice suddenly disappeared off the face of the Universe (boom boom). And of course it wouldn't have been a very happy ending for Alan Rickman's superb Marvin the Paranoid Android! But then again, wouldn't you be like that on a spaceship where the doors sigh contently every time you passed through them? I thought so.6/10",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
167,d_art,Hitching...,7,8 May 2005,"Speaking of sci-fi, I recently saw the movie, Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. A bit of a scattered film, with events happening left and right, but in that sense it held true to Douglas Adam's writing style. If you've read his novels, you'll notice he'll often go off in tangents to explain the oddities of his weird world. I guess in one sense his book doesn't translate that well as a traditional 3-act play type of movie. I recall reading this series (I read up to So Long and Thanks for All the Fish) and playing his Infocom computer text adventure game based on his books. This was back in the 80's, when I was like in elementary school. I first got into his book because I was playing a text adventure game based on his book at the time and needed hints on how to solve the darn game. Needless to say, the books didn't help much. I had to find hints for it to finally solve it. Also, what attracted me to the book was that green little ball-like guy in the cover that kind of looked like Slimer from Ghostbusters. I still haven't figured out what that green guy was, but I generally assumed it was the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal they sometimes mention in the books. Pretty zany, this writer. His humor is pretty out there and although I may not share in his wacky views (then again, his world has its own physics and logic) he is very imaginative and quite funny. How's the movie, you ask? Generally, one will either hate it because it is, in a way, all over the place (almost like Mummy Returns, but this one at least is much wittier) or one will like it for its boldness and originality. What did I think. I'm one of those who don't mind that much if people change a bit from the book to make a better movie. I think movies and books are separate mediums and one should make the most of the advantages given on each medium. Some things I think worked real well (actors, physical comedy, special effects), others, not as well--for me, it was the pacing and lack of clarity for some scenes (some parts can feel a bit jumbled, and sometimes it needed some more silent time for the audience to process). Overall, I thought it was a fairly interesting movie, but nothing to bring your friends over for dinner for.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
168,Jim-Eadon,Worse than the total perspective vortex,3,16 May 2005,"Hitchhikers Guide To The Galaxy. (Minor spoilers) The novels of Douglas Adams, particularly the first 3 hitchhikers novels and first Dirk Gently novel, are close to my heart. A movie excitingly looms! Woe! I hear a lot of negative press (in the UK) about Hitchhikers Guide To The Galaxy - the movie. Apparently Douglas Adams perpetually delayed the movie because he objected to the choice of Director. Then the Grim Reaper did his worst, and with Adams slain by his exertions on an exercise bike, the ironically Vogon-like movie industry was free to murder his art. But I just had to see the movie out of a kind of masochistic curiosity. It was a waste of money. If I were not familiar with the humour, warmth and finesse of Adam's writing, then I might have found this movie mostly harmless. Instead the experience was as uncomfortable as a ride in the Total Perspective Vortex. The script took the gold of the source material and spewed out vile nonsense a notch more agonising than Vogon poetry. The score was full of aggravating little comedy dittos that were supposed to scream at us: this bit is jauntily funny, OK? The TV series of Hitchhikers, produced by the BBC many moons ago, was abjectly brilliant, proving that Adam's writing can be incredibly funny visually. So there was no excuse for the failure of this movie. The special effects were uninspired and tacky looking, but not in a way that worked, there was no Hitchhikers atmosphere, no sense of wonder. I didn't like one of the characters, not one, in this movie. I liked them all in the TV series. Marvin was unforgettable in the TV series. Here he was reduced to some kind of white robot baby. His moping was simply a non-entity. Zaphod was portrayed without charm. The script kept having him labelled as ""Stupid"". Testicles to that! This approach illustrated how badly the filmmakers missed the entire point of Zaphod's appeal, and the comic essence of Adam's creations in general. Then there was Arthur. I feared the worst upon learning the casting of Martin Freeman, who is as irritating as hell in the comedy ""The Office"". I just can't stand the actor, even if he seems like a nice guy. Or probably because he seems a nice guy and nothing more. And here he was as unfunny as ever. Even straight men have to have comic timing. Ford Prefect came over as a clown, which again misses his point. In the movie Ford had was not enigmatic, nor plausible: I did not buy into his character. Mos Def can't act, and seemed to be there as the token ethic minority presence. Slartybartfarst was presented as a kind of underdog benevolent angel character whose existence seemed to be to provide a Deus Ex Machina exposition of the ensuing oversweet ending, which again, is not in the book and for good reason. Finally there was Trillian with her huge gorgeous eyes. God her presence irritated the hell out of me, for she was literally unbearably cute in a non complementary sense. Her chemistry with Arthur was as non-existent as her presence was nauseating. At the start of the credits the words popped up: ""to Douglas""  an overly familiar tribute to a man who I have little doubt would have HATED this fetid turd, and doubly so to have his name attached to it in such a ghastly and patronising act of shameless exploitation, nay, Treachery! The chance of them turning a Universe as rich as Adam's into a movie as bad as this is one in 2 to the power of 1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000. Cubed.

169,Wulfstan10,"Not Perfect, But Pretty Close",8,10 May 2005,"Overall, I think this film is great and it really hits the key elements and spirit of the books. A lot has been cut out and quite a bit has been added or changed around a bit, but generally I think these changes worked very well in modifying the book into a film, considering the limitations of bringing a book like this to the screen. As it was, it all made sense, to the extent the books are supposed to, and it's funny and entertaining.I personally don't think anyone needs to have read any of the books prior to seeing this movie. In fact, I think it is probably better that one see the film with a clean slate. I was unaware of what had been changed, so, having read the books, I kept expecting or wondering if certain things would happen, while things I didn't expect did happen. I had to try to put the books out of my mind, but couldn't so this was a bit of a problem. Fortunately, since the changes ultimately don't significantly harm the story, I was able to get past it and, especially after I got used to what had been changed, I could fully enjoy the movie without my preformed expectations.That said, the film does not quite live up to the greatness of the books. It modifies the characters' motivations in a way that I guess makes sense for a film but which does harm the story a bit. It also adds some scenes which, although very funny, aren't as fitting with Adams' humor as some things they cut out. For example, I would have loved to have seen Prosser (the guy in charge of demolishing Arthur's house) twirling his fur cap while visions of mounted warriors and spears danced in his head). In the end, though, these changes don't really compromise the adaptation.Also, some of the visuals were great. I especially loved the scene where Slartibartfast takes Arthur to the Megrathean factory floor, which really helps hit home the scale and wonder of what's at issue, and of what is facing Arthur, properly still wearing has bath robe.Overall, the cast were great and fit their roles well. This is especially true of Arthur, English ""everyman,"" and Slartibartfast. Zaphod was also cast very well, as Rockwell, although different than what I had always envisioned, excellently portrays the combination of vanity, thoughtlessness, sleaziness, and sort of self-centred good humour that characterises Zaphod.I also liked the Dolphins' song, which was funny and very catchy.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

171,OlieRendch,Wow. What a crazy and random film.,9,29 October 2012,"I love sci-fi, I love comedy, and I love Martin Freeman. So this film is a faveourite of mine. It's based off a book series by Douglas Adams which I have to admit I have never read. I did hear of the TV Series but I don't know much about it. But this film I think is really good. Very funny, cheesy and sci-fi packed; the mind of Adams is very random judging from the film and my faveourite ever thing in the movie is the Improbability Drive. Lol, that's hilarious. It's a British-American film which I think can be very good. I suppose it could have been a film series but I don't think it'll happen (what do you think?). I would always watch it again and I'm going to put it as a candidate on my Top 10 Fave Film list.http://theojreviews.blogspot.co.uk/",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
172,echozdog,Not bad...Not great...but not bad,8,1 May 2005,"As I sat down in the theater to watch the big screen version of one of my favorite past times, I thought this is either going to be REALLY bad (see 1981 mini series) or it's going to be REALLY good. I was wrong. The movie stayed pretty close to the radio series parts 1,2,3 and 4. Added is the religious character Humma Kavula (John Malkovich) and the Vogon are the cops of the Galaxy (I guess). Freeman does a great Arthur and I was OK with Mos Def's version of Ford Prefect (much better than David Dixon...he sucked). Zooey Deschanel did a nice Trillian (but they had her more of an adventurer than a brilliant scientist). Sam Rockwell played Zaphod more of a egomaniac than the cool hipster I'm used to. They wanted to make him dumber too for some reason. Bill Nighy did a great new version of Slartibardfast.They mucked a bit with the story which was OK, but what they added wasn't all that funny. I would have rather they took the story to Milli-Ways ""The restaurant at the end of the Universe"". Oh well I look forward to the sequel as I'm sure it's coming since the movie made $21 million opening weekend.It's hard for me to say whether you would like this movie coming in fresh. I think people are going to go into three camps...""I loved it""..""It was not bad""(me)...""What a waste of time"".

173,psi_fla,Not as good as it should have been,7,2 May 2005,"Directed by: Garth Jennings Starring: Martin Freeman, Mos Def, Sam Rockwell, Zooey Deschanel, John Malkovich, Bill Nighy, Anna Chancellor, Alan Rickman (voice), Stephen Fry (voice), Warwick Davis I haven't read any of the five volumes of Douglas Adams' five-part ""trilogy"", the Complete Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy, so you could say that my expectations were not matched by those who expected it to stay faithful to the radio show, the early '80's TV show, or the books. To be honest, I was drawn to this by its irreverent look and promising cast.Now, for anyone else unfortunate enough to be uninitiated...Arthur Dent (Martin Freeman) is having one of those days. The local authorities want to build a bypass through his house, in the country (yes, I know it sounds silly, but that's the whole spirit of the thing). His best mate, Ford Prefect (Mos Def) is an alien. And the Vogons are coming down to destroy Earth! No fear, Ford will get Arthur out of danger - and into an adventure with some more crazy characters, like the president of the galaxy, Zaphod Beeblebrox (Sam Rockwell) and Marvin the Paranoid Android (Warwick Davis; voice of Alan Rickman). Thankfully for Arthur, there is another human on board - Tricia ""Trillian"" McMillan (Zooey Deschanel), so you could say that his sanity stays intact to a certain extent.Sanity's not a good word to use when describing the film. Both fans and non-fans expect the film to be ""far out"", and the film delivers.The talent behind the camera knows this. The director, Garth Jennings, was behind that crazy-but-brilliant video for Blur's ""Coffee and TV"". The composer is long time Divine Comedy collaborator Joby Talbot, and the ironic tone of his score fits the scene perfectly. (As a bonus, he even has Neil Hannon sing the closing credits song!) The talent in front of the camera is exceptional. Everyone - and I mean everyone - is perfectly cast. I don't think anyone but Martin Freeman could have played Arthur Dent as well. On this evidence, he may have a very good future as an everyman. Zooey Deschanel also deserves a mention (although she had one scene where she appeared to be forcing emotion). She may be one of today's most underrated and underused actresses.Like Doctor Who, The Hitchhiker's Guide has numerous intelligent and innovative ideas, quite a few of which are heard in Stephen Fry's voice-over of the book itself. It also has a strong sense of fun and doesn't rely on its effects. Nevertheless, it uses the budget it has to create some of the most memorable moments in the film. Watch out for the scenes where Slartibartfast (Bill Nighy) literally takes Arthur on a moving tour of another world, or when the gang encounter Humma Kavula (John Malkovich).It all sounds so good. So why is this reviewer not as satisfied as he could have been? Let's start with the nit-picks. More Marvin at the expense of Zaphod and Ford wouldn't have gone amiss. No disrespect to Sam Rockwell and Mos Def, but their characters do get a little tiresome after a while. Here's a plot hole for you too (POSSIBLE SPOILER WARNING) - what exactly becomes of John Malkovich's character? You can be sure I don't know the answer. (Maybe a sequel will resolve things.) The real problem lies where I don't want it to lie - the Arthur-Trillian romantic connection, which apparently wasn't in the first book. I've no qualms with it being in the film, but it is poorly executed. It doesn't have enough feeling to it. Freeman and Deschanel do their best to make it work, but the script lets them down. If these two had even a hint of the subtle chemistry that Freeman and Lucy Davis shared in The Office, the love story may have been special. Instead it seems entirely forced and obligatory. The near cop-out at the end of the romantic subplot was enough to leave me disgusted (and cost the film a mark). I wonder if Douglas Adams would have been that pleased with an ending that feels a little too happy-clappy.The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy is a perfectly fine adaptation, but it should have been more considering the amount of talent on board.Rating: 7/10",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

However as a film, it seems to mainly succeed in being funny and entertaining. When Arthur Dent (Martin Freeman) starts a bad day having the local council wish to demolish his house, it is only the beginning as aliens also want to demolish the Earth. He and his friend Ford (Mos Def) escape - and start a series of adventures in space. They rely heavily on the advice given in the best selling manual ""Hitchhikers Guide"" which seems full of mostly useless space trivia. The leads of the picture are less satisfying than the supporting cast which includes Bill Nighy, John Malcovitch, and voice over Stephen Fry, who do much to lift the production. Also the monsters created by the Jim Henson Workshop with overtones of Lewis Carroll are most threatening and amusing at the same time. It's a little uneven but overall a happy and zany excursion into the world of space satire. Yet, one cannot but wonder how much better it may have been had the Monty Python team tackled the picture a few years ago, with Terry Gilliam directing and perhaps a younger John Cleese as Arthur.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

A few aspects of the tv series, while low-budget, were also great.I found the film version unwatchable, pretty much from the start. In fact, it was so unwatchable I walked out soon after the arrival on Magrathea.Fast forward 15 years and I've tried to watch it again. Really I've tried!

176,aqua_swing,"This is not the end of the world, just the first part in a series.",9,30 April 2005,"Just about two months ago now, I was thrust into my first reading of these classic Silly-Fi novels, and after a bit of reading of all 5 sections, was as excited as anyone else to hear of the movie coming out, but was very confused about how much of the story was going to be thrust into it, and how they'd work around not having one film of about four hours long just to cover the basics.And so tonight, I (along with seven other people I know better than strangers) embarked on a video trip for 110 minutes, that included all of the silliness expected from the book transfer. The story was basically sound, and the character development in everyone that you were concerned about was just fine. Mos Def's Ford Prefect was perfectly cast, along with Sam Rockwell's Zaphod, and especially this version of Marvin, (walked around by Willow, and voiced by Alan Rickman) whose big head and sad green eyes gave you more silly empathy for a robot than other incarnations of the same character.But then again there are always things that get missed, or barely touched on in a transfer from Radio show to book to album to television series to five books to movie. While the director (Garth Jennings) was trying to pack in as much as possible from the original book, he was also forgetting to bring the story back around again into a sensible, meaningful end. Two parts of the story (the whole Humma Kuvula angle, a character created by Douglas Adams for John Malkovich being one, and Zaphod's explanation of his second head being the other) seemed to be abolished completely, which kind of leaves you wondering exactly what happened in the end. And maybe that's a good thing, maybe that's because it's what he wants. Maybe there will be a sequel in The Restaurant at the end of the universe, which could in turn bring a lot of the unanswered questions around again, which would make this movie much more accessible with faithful readers.That being said, besides these points, this movie does stand on it's own two feet as a spectacular piece of film. The visuals are stunning, which includes the very silly/cheap looking effects put together for the book's explanation on different questions. There is a lot of comedy intertwined, a lot of lighthearted fun with the partially annoying Zaphod, and the love story that's intertwined with Arthur and Trillian gets tangled up into everything nicely, because it's not completely the focus of the movie. There is however, never a moment where you wonder to yourself what else they could have packed into this thing, because it's so full of information it's like having you in hyperdrive.If you do like seeing films that don't actually require a reading of the book, this is a good representation of a literature to film project that doesn't suck. Douglas Adams would be proud of this film, hopefully moreso than the silly little British Television version, and I cannot stress the fact more that we need to have as many films as books, because I'd love to see each actor reprise his/her roles in a sequel form. Let's just hope that it doesn't take another thirty years to get it all together.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

That, it would appear, means little thought or effort needs to be spent on them as the audience is already there. I was indifferent about this film before I saw it, but now I think you'd be much better buying the DVDs of the still-hilarious six-part TV series.For what its worth, the film version looks good, what with its bigger budget. Unfortunately the characters leave a lot to be desired. Arther Dent seems completely underwhelmed by anything he comes across, Ford just seems aimless, Zaphod is just a boorish oaf and Marvin looks like a snowman. Everyone else just seems to be reading their lines, with all the enthusiasm of actors working out what they're going to do with their pay cheques. Deep Thought's voice is especially uninspiring, and the whole thing lacks any of the sense of awe, wonder or darkness of the TV series.

That's just the first 20 pages.I loved this book and its sequels. They were wildly imaginative, satirically insightful, attempted to answer questions about the nature of reality, and featured a cast of characters you could care about  even Marvin, the ever-depressed robot. The serialized radio show that preceded the initial book was a good complement, putting appropriate voices and attitudes to your imagination. What the movie version of the book made me realize is that the author's frame of reference is so ""out there,"" you need time to get oriented to his universe and warm up to his characters. A single, two-hour movie squeezes out all this soft stuff, so you're left with a messy array of signature gag lines, dizzying CGI effects, and a compressed plot line. Prior fans of the radio show and book will get a kick out of the visuals, but those new to Adams' work would be more richly entertained by the older media.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

I have been looking forward to seeing the late great Douglas Adam's work on the big screen for years.And so what did we get? Well overall a very good adaptation is what has been presented, its worth bearing in mind not only did they have to squeeze the novel into two hours (the original TV series had three hours) but also every incarnation of the HHGTTG has always differed from the previous one. Add the fact that it was necessary to make this accessible and understandable for non HHGTTG viewers and storyline changes became necessary and were to be expected.The best parts were the brilliant casting of Stephen Fry as the voice of the book, the continuation of using the UK as the Earth setting (as opposed to shifting it to the USA as per most films these days) the breathtakingly brilliant scenes in the Magarathean Factory Floor and the expansion of the role of the Vogons complete with their wonderfully bureaucratic officialdom! Also wonderful to see (and hear) are nods to the original TV series including the original Marvin in the queue on Vogonsphere, the theme tune and also the original Arthur as the recorded ghostly announcement. (Brilliant closing line 'Your death may be recorded for training purposes' brought the joke nicely up to date I felt) The special effects overall are excellently done and there are good performances from nearly all the cast, however there are problem areas.Mos Def was miscast as Ford Prefect by a country mile, it needed a zanier character actor to make this unique part pay off. The Ultimate Question, 42 and Deep Thought plot line was reduced significantly to little more than a side show and whilst the diversion to Vogonsphere was funny and well done, it seemed to arrive in the film as though it had been snuck into the script after the final draft had already been written in a 'Oh we seem to be on Asgard and Vogonsphere, lets play along for twenty minutes then return back to the Magarathea plot again' kind of way.Also the 'joke' with the bat like things that kept leaping up and hitting them made no sense whatsoever and failed miserably whilst the all important role of tea is severely reduced and the majority of the wonderful banter between Mr Prosser (the bypass foreman) and Arthur lying in the mud was cut and felt very rushed.The Guide graphics took some getting used to after the familiarity of the TV series version that all HHGTTG fans took as gospel but they grew on me.Personally I would have preferred the film to have been another half hour longer to allow more of the classic favourite elements better room, however I have at last been granted the wish I hoped for when I first saw the original series  Arthur finally gets the girl, and about time too! Newcomers to the HHGTTG universe will either run a mile in a confused state never to return or be hooked for life. If the latter, two strong recommendations  read the book and watch the original TV series and don't talk to me about life..",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

Not only was the original BBC series sharper, wittier, and more entertaining, it was actually better produced. The attack of the Vogon fleet was far more impressive than the piddling episode offered up here. The sense of a vast universe full of infinite possibilities was much better captured. The acting was infinitely superior. Only Stephen Fry (as the voice of the book) manages to capture the droll tone of the original series. The three Yanks imported to play the leads slurred and mumbled their way through their parts, as if embarrassed to be in a movie and determined not to be caught ""acting"". Half the time I could barely understand was Mos Def was saying. He seemed to think only every other word was important enough to enunciate, and god forbid he should actually make an effort to deliver a joke.One or two things in this movie were impressive. Arthur Dent's tour of the Magrathean Factory was outstanding. On the other hand, Zaphod's stolen spaceship looked like a golf ball and Marvin the Android like a refugee from TOY STORY. Not only didn't this film live up to the original TV series, it didn't even live up to the radio show. A multi-million dollar movie that fails to be as impressive as a half hour radio program.

They were funny, not side splitting, I've lost control of my bladder funny, but funny enough for me to keep reading . I even saw the old Hitchhikers mini-series on TV on the BBC. It was OK, but ouch, was the budget limited. Still, I chuckled. Heck, I even played the video game by Infocom. It was a text adventure, and it was co-written with Mr Adams himself. I had the most fun with that! Filling the shoes of poor Arthur Dent while he realizes his home is gone, following Ford Prefect, his friend, around the galaxy, and finding out that the universe is very, well, ridiculous.And then there is this big budget movie. I wish I could have been more excited after watching it.First, we have to come to the conclusion that movies just don't translate well when they have to pack together a bunch of books. Then, we have to face another fact: funny ha has in the books don't always mean funny ha ha's in the movie. A lot of the comedy that we see is of the slapstick kind. Arthur is shown as a bumbling idiot. In the book, it felt more like an English man who just found out his home planet was destroyed, and, bloody hell, all he wants is for his life to go back the way it was, a spot of tea and maybe a biscuit with that, thank you very much.There are some good points, and some hilarious scenes, a dozen or so good one-liners, but nothing that thrilled me beyond the point that made me remember how much fun I had reading the book, or playing the game.About the best I could say is Marvin, voiced wonderfully by Alan Rickman. A depressed robot who'd rather be dead. How depressing it is, indeed, that Mr Adams wasn't alive to see this movie. I do wonder if he was still alive, if perhaps he would have been able to tweak it a bit more to make it better.Still, I'll give the movie a 6.

185,robbotnik2000,Enthusiastic but flawed and less than clever,6,29 April 2005,"Douglas Adams started with a script and the brilliant sound effects of the BBC Radiophonic Workshop, then came a BBC TV series, and Adams' five book 'trilogy'. The new movie tries to capture the feel and a sort of 'message' of the Adams original, but in doing so it sacrifices plot, characters, events, pacing, and many cherished scenes of the original series. Language: The original radio series had as its main sentient characters exclusively English speakers, of the kind who can deliver witty lines fast and furious, while being very clear on the transatlantic ear. The computers and mechanized beings were of a density, they wanted to be effusively friendly at the expense of all intelligence and commonsense. There was more happening here than was ever explicitly stated. There was a subtext that spoke to anyone who was ever offended, even if they didn't know why, at being escorted through a Disney universe by robots mouthing historical platitudes, and grinning people acting like robots and dressing in big cartoon costumes). When Eddie ""your shipboard computa"" apologizes for his uselessness in any situation where he is truly needed, he is acting out what we all know, that technology often gives us more and more of less and less. Linking the useless hyper-modernity with Americanism and the quaint tea drinking Arthur Dent with a British core was no accident. Hip hop artist Mos Def as Ford Prefect, and Zooey Deschanel as Trillium rip apart this delicate distinction into the human characters, we no longer have this delicate but vital distinction. Worse still, we don't get anything in return. The worst feature of the 80's English television venture was the use of American high pitched bimbo to be Trillium. Zooey is a better choice, but she is as awkward to place as was Trillium in the original series, who disappeared out of the latter radio installments. There is an entire excursion about rescuing Trillium from the Vogons that seemed to be 'tacked in', and there was an attractive but useless addition to the cast who led the Vogons in the pursuit of Zaphod Beeblebrox. In the case of Zaphod, Sam Rockwell did a capable rendition, with the second head and the third arm cleverly installed, although there is UPA (useless plot addition in having him leave one of the heads as a surety while he picks up a 'special gun' from Megrathea). In the less than two hours that the screenwriters had to establish the themes and tie up the loose ends they seemed to settle for visitation rights on the theme of displacement ? the whole interstellar bypass shtick, and such items as the manifestation of a whale in the upper atmosphere along with a bowl of petunias, and the visit to Megrathea. The effects are for the most part well done, The Planet Factory is excellent, The Vogons superb, and there is a now a Hitchhiker's Movie theme song, ""So Long And Thanks For All The Fish"" If you thought you'd get to see Ford Prefect chat up a robot waitress at Milliways, Zaphod put into the Total Perspective Vortex, or Arthur Dent fall out the ear of his own statue, you're going to have to wait for the sequel. I have just done watching ""Gormenghast"", which was a successful rendition of a book series to a visual medium. Hitchhiker as a movie fails in giving life to its radio predecessor. Hitchhiker gets C+ for casting, B+ for effects, and a C- for theme delivery.

And it was amazing.Somehow, everything I imagined whilst reading the book, and the way its quintessential British humour often made me laugh loudly and suddenly and choke on my food, was perfectly translated into the movie. The CGI was absolutely breathtaking - the Magrathea factory floor in particular blew my mind, as well as the zoom out from Arthur's house just as the Earth is destroyed. I also loved the interpretation of the Heart of Gold - amongst all of the sleek fighter-jet-type things people seem to like in Star Wars, it's nice to sometimes see what's pretty much a big blob floating through space.Let me just say it: this movie is funny. Now, that is something I say veeerrrryyyyy rarely. But that somewhat straight-faced nonchalant kind of matter-of-fact humour that made the book what it was really came through here. In particular, I really enjoyed the entire cast's portrayal of the characters, and somehow Alan Rickman as the voice of a depressed robot is perfect. Also: I highly recommend reading the book before you watch this. Partially because otherwise it will be pretty confusing, and partially because it's one of the greatest works of fiction I've ever read.I really don't get everyone's problem with this movie. I guess it's just everyone being all 'tHeY cHaNgeD sOmE StUfF', because clearly some people don't realise that the movie isn't supposed to be a carbon-copy of the book. However, despite not being a carbon-copy of the book, the feel of the book was very much there - even the segments that weren't there in the original book somehow fit in really well with the plot line. I've read somewhere that a lot of said segments are brought up in the later books which I intend to start reading immediately.Also, there's the fact that you are trying to put an entire, ridiculously flamboyant, extravagant book into a two-hour movie. Which is often going to be viewed by people who have not read the book. So it's pretty unavoidable to have to cut and shorten some of the explanations.Anyway, this is a great movie. It's crazy, it's pretty ridiculous, but it is hilarious, and you should watch it.-Sasha.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

To me, it is very weird and difficult for me to rate highly because I struggled to pick up the plot, other than something about Earth's destruction to make way for a galactic expressway. There are also other weird things that I have difficulty describing: like when the spaceship that our main character, Arthur, is travelling in can go to random worlds. However, I do find it to be good as mindless entertainment and there are worse ways to spend your night (watching Battlefield Earth for instance).The acting, as done by a whole host of people I am not particularly familiar with, is OK. I particularly liked the overtly depressed large-headed robot who knew too much about the universe and as such was extremely depressed about it. There are some vaguely funny parts, like when the narrator explains that the dolphins were trying to warn the humans about Earth's impending destruction but the humans misinterpreted them or when our heroes continually get slapped in the face by fly swatters on this world.In conclusion, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy provides decent entertainment, but it was too weird for me to understand and that makes it difficult for me to rate highly.3/5 stars",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
188,DragoonKain,Captures the Essence of the Book the Best Way a Film Can,8,1 May 2005,"Making a Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy movie is not an easy thing to do. Much more difficult is making it work. So much of the humor of the book relies on philosophical asides as Adams drifts off on completely random, but strangely relevant tangents. How can one capture this feeling in a movie and not have the audience sit there dumbfounded? Well first, you need a narrator. There's no way around it, without a narrator half the funny from the book is gone. Second, the narrator, and most of the cast has to have British accents. That goes without saying. Lastly, approach it the way Monty Python would have. Afterall, Adams started off his film and television career working on Monty Python's Flying Circus (I believe he was friends with Terry Jones). There is no doubt, when reading his books, that he has that same twisted sense of humor that the Python boys did. Only his point of view was much more philosophical. You could tell he was a man who thought about things a lot, probably too much, but that's what makes his books so brilliant.The most important thing when making a hitchhiker's movie is to make sure that you don't dumb it down. Sure pacing is ridiculously fast, and it doesn't give much of the audience much time to think. But if they're paying attention, they will get the jokes, and they will be all the funnier for it.The movie did a superb of capturing the essence of the books as best they could. It followed the plot of the first book for the most part, with a few things borrowed from his later books, a few new things, and, inevitably, more than few things left out. But I still believe that these books are perhaps the most un-filmable novels ever written, or at least that I've read. And because of this, the movie is not perfect. It's lacking something essential that you get from reading it. I think it's the sense of mystery and suspense. It was impossible to stop reading at the end of each chapter because you really wanted to see what happened next. Maybe it's because I already read the books and know the story, but I felt that this suspense was severely lacking in this film.Nevertheless, it makes for a very funny movie, and having read the books, I was able to get all of the jokes. I'm curious if it would be the same for someone that hadn't, however. The visuals are spectacular, the characters are dead on, and well performed, and the plot is, well, distinctly Adams'. But there was definitely something important missing, and I think it's something that can't possibly be translated on film. They really couldn't have made it any better. Go see it, it's worth the 10 bucks.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
189,segratz,A bit disappointing,5,5 May 2005,"I did like this movie but it's nothing exceptional or amazing. In a lot of ways, it's a standard Disney-esquire adventure story that is short on humor, effects, and action. Considering it's from a beloved book (that I have never read! but I plan on it!) I would have thought it would be cooler. Instead the story is a bit of the same-old-same-old and the romance in it is rushed and boring. The acting is well done for the most part and I thought MOs Def did a great job considering his name is MOs Def. I just wish the film had been more British and less Disney in it's nature. Highlights include the character of Marvin (voiced by Warwick Davis...professor Snape in the Harry Potter movies), well done special effects of space, and the delightful opening song. None of those things though make it worth the full price of a movie ticket however.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
190,zapdude,Simply awful.,1,24 September 2005,"I tried, I really truly tried, to find any redeeming aspect of this horrid movie, but was unable to.Every character was completely miscast, every line was sheer agony, every sight gag was cringe-worthy. The parts of the BBC series that had me laughing were gone, replaced by sanitized junk. The special effects were too large and, for lack of a better word, overbearing. The makers of this movie completely missed the concept of ""campy"" and went for realism, which was totally out of place.Unfortunately, THIS is now how a large portion of the world will remember Douglas Adams, a true tragedy.Watching the BBC series was pure magic, the characters had that sort of Dr. Who surrealism, the situations were completely believable in that special Adams sort of way. The movie? Nope.I wanted to enjoy it. I heard from non-HHG fans that it was horrible, but hoped they just didn't get the humor. Well, it sucked... totally, completely, awfully, sucked. In case you missed the point of this review, let me restate it: this movie was HORRIBLE, and a travesty of the work of the original books and radio and BBC series.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
191,pandabat,What must this be like to a newcomer? Spoilers might actually help them!,7,6 May 2005,"The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy! Quite a sizable phenomenon in terms of books, radio series, TV series and followers. I, like many others, had sampled its delights in one form or another over the years and awaited the big-screen movie version with a hesitant curiosity. Mixed reviews had filtered through and I didn't really know what to expect, so it must be said that I went to the picture-house with lowered expectations. Approached in this fashion, ""The Guide"" shouldn't disappoint!The opening sequence provides a bursting, visual feast of blue as dolphins move, jump, glide, swim and twist to the slightly awkward singing of a song entitled ""So Long & Thanks For All The Fish"" (the relevance is explained in the movie)! It's certainly more a visual than aural experience but neatly encapsulates what the real big screen is all about - pitiful 'MTV Cribs' imitations can eat their hearts out!And so the story begins, or least something resembling a story! It had been quite some time since I had read the book but it would be fair to say that I had some familiarity with the material. I pity those who have none, for once the initial 10-minute introduction to our protagonist, Arthur Dent, and his friend, Ford Prefect, is over, the plot bounds along at the speed of the oft-used hyperspace. Characters and locations come and go without proper introductions, reasons for existence, motivations or goodbyes! Trying to envisage how a Hitchhiker's virgin would collate all this, I have failed. I am too close to the subject to see it objectively. (by the way, for readers of the old ""Eagle"" comic watch out for the builder near the port-a-loo at Arthur Dent's newly demolished house that to me looked exactly like ""Doomlord"") If you can fill in the blanks or simply don't care about following what's going on, the movie does offer some laughs which (mostly) stand up on their own merit, with the humour being more British than American.The performances from the cast are fine. None are really as I imagined. Martin Freeman does an adequate Arthur Dent, although I always imagined him to be older. Mos Def does an adequate Ford Prefect, though I always imagined him smaller. Zooey Deschanel does bring the curious ability to make her pretty looks more attractive than they should be, although I imagined Trillian to be blonde for some reason. For me, Sam Rockwell steals the show as an excellently egocentric, flashy but cheesy Zaphod Beeblebrox, although I always imagined Zaphod to be fatter! The biggest disappointment for me was Marvin, the depressed robot. He just looks too cutesy to be Marvin (more Teletubby than very grumpy) and he's voiced by Alan Rickman, who I have all the time in the world for, but who, probably for historical reasons, would come across to maturer audiences as more cynical than depressed! Again, it's so long since I have read the book that my imaginings may be completely out of place and truth be told, by the end of the movie, I had accepted the characters' new shapes, looks and faces.The special effects are fine. They're not overdone and in-your-face CGI bits are not as ubiquitous as in some other modern sci-fi movies. Puppets, prosthetics and props play as big a part as rendered scenes. In other words, the FX do the job! Deserving of special mention though is the scene inside Slartibartfast's planet factory. This jawdroppingingly beautiful spectacular makes you want to instantly pack up your knapsack and head for the stars.However, all roads lead back to the reason for the film, which is the story and the telling thereof. Whether the budget exists or will be found, the door is certainly left open for one or more sequels which may, or may not, fill in some blanks and gaps that are in this movie. The movie certainly didn't feel as long as its 110 minutes, which is always a good sign. Ultimately, if you know the story then you can go and see this and have a perfectly good time, although it's unlikely that you'll be rushing to buy the DVD for posterity. On the other hand, if you're a newbie to getting you and your towel around the universe by using your thumb, then you'll probably be left often asking, rather like Arthur Dent, just what is going on?",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
192,dholliday-imdb,"first half-hour is decent, then it just gets silly & incomprehensible",5,6 May 2015,"I've no history with The Hitchhiker's Guide, but having spent most of my formative years in dear ol' blighty I'm well aware of the ""42"" jokes and absurdisms like thanking for all the fish.Still, as someone who likes Red Dwarf, Galaxy Quest and Mars Attacks I was all set to enjoy a humorous sci-fi romp but it didn't really happen here. The first half-hour is interesting but after that the film loses all narrative flow, especially for someone who's not read the hallowed novels.The cast don't help: like Hugh Grant, Martin Freeman always seems to play himself but he's particularly one-note here (he's great in Sherlock, tho'). The rest are bland, with Sam Rockwell being merely awful. The predictably-stupid love triangle is without any substance. Only Yasiin Bey injects some eccentric character but his role is reduced after the first half-hour. Marvin would surely have worked better if he was a paranoid android rather than a simply-depressed one.There's a couple of lightly-funny scenes, and also a couple of awesome CGI shots, and Martin Freeman, for all his one-noteness, remains eminently watchable. Otherwise there's not much on offer here. Not particularly recommended.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
193,shattenjager777,"Some mistakes were definitely made with this, but it is still close enough to Adams to be great",10,21 May 2005,"""The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"" is my favorite novel ever written. It may even be my favorite piece of literature in history (I would have trouble choosing between it and ""Hamlet""). So, I watched this latest adaptation (since it began as a radio series and was later adapted into every form of media known to man, though most know it only through being a five-book ""trilogy""--as Adams called it--of novels) with a mixture of fear and excitement. I feared it would be ruined, especially without the master himself there to watch over them; and yet I thought that especially with Adams having written the screenplay, it had to capture at least some of the genius I had found in all of Adams's work--from ""The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"" to ""Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency"" to ""Last Chance to See."" Thankfully, it was more the latter than the former case.The casting was hit-and-miss, with Sam Rockwell being a perfect choice for Zaphod Beeblebrox (though he is unfortunately reduced to a jerkish moron in the film where he was much more real and complex in the novels and short story), Martin Freeman being a perfect choice for Arthur Dent (who became less bland in the film--moving a bit toward the pathetic side), Zooey Deschanel being a terrible choice for one of the few characters whose physical appearance is really described in detail in the novel in Trillian (whom I found to be much weaker in the film and lacking the toughness that I enjoyed in her in the novels), Mos Def being a decent enough choice for a character who was completely unlike the novel version in Ford Prefect (and we get very little of his character in this film), and Alan Rickman having a perfect Marvin voice while the best actor in the film (the always-excellent and ever-unnoticed Warwick Davis) was unfortunately hidden underneath the Marvin costume. Also notable, but for the reason of being terribly annoying, was the performance of John Malkovich as Humma Kavula, whose appearance in the film I find utterly worthless since the novel has plenty of bits that could have been added to replace him. The characters lost something of the three-dimensionality they had in the novel form and thus the performances did not require much of the actors except for Freeman, who had to play a surprisingly interesting version of the novels' everyman Arthur Dent. However, I must point out that I absolutely love this vision of Marvin. While the novel does describe him as a new, shiny, silver robot and this vision doesn't fit that, it absolutely suits the personality of the Paranoid Android--he has a gigantic head (""brain the size of a planet""), which emphasizes his intelligence and forces him to sort of walk with a permanent stoop that is what one might expect from the personality prototype.I was happy to see that at least the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal played a part in the film, since that is right next to the Babel Fish as proof of the non-existence of God as my favorite passage of the novel, but, as was a sort of theme with this film, it went unexplained. They never explained that it was ""a mind-bogglingly stupid creature that assumes if you can't see it, it can't see you."" In much the same way, the logic behind keeping track of one's towel is never explained and Ford's logical method for getting Arthur away from the bulldozers is replaced with him bringing beer. Adams was a wacky writer, but let's not deprive him of all intellectual merits, and those merits are greatly reduced in this production, as evidenced by these changes and the complete exorcism of all of the philosophical ponderings that riddle the series. There was also an attempt to focus the film around a story more tightly--since Adams was definitely given to meanderings and tangents--which is understandable, but it is focused around a love story between Arthur and Trillian that Trillian quickly kills off in the novel. Sometimes this story grows unbearable, such as in Arthur's scene explaining that ""the only question that has ever mattered"" to him is ""Is she the one? And the answer is yes,"" which is unbelievably trite and silly, though hilariously ended by the mice exclaiming, ""What's with all this 'is she the one' crap? Let's just take his brain!"" Still, the film allowed for Douglas Adams's style to come through to some extent, using a few (though far too few for me) wonderful Guide entries along the way and telling some stories that little relate to what's going on with our heroes. Although I must say that I found it very odd the way this film managed to make the events of the final two novels all but impossible to work on film and even those of ""The Restaurant at the End of the Universe"" awkward, since it would seem sensible to set yourself up to be able to make a sequel. I also have to say that I loved the fact that Marvin got to save the day at the end, since he has always been my favorite character.All in all, ""The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"" is a better-than-expected film adaptation of what I would consider an unfilmable novel (since that is its best-known form) and even a little of Douglas Adams's genius is enough to make a film more entertaining than anything since at least ""Big Fish"" and most likely more entertaining than anything that will follow for a long time. And those of us who loved Adams's work undoubtedly are happy just to see it appearing on the screen, especially when the film ends with a card reading simply, ""For Douglas."" I just hope they don't try to make a sequel completely without him.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
194,TIALI,"mostly harmless, mostly",4,2 May 2005,"What's wrong with the Hitchhiker's Guide is that the big screen version attempts to advance the visual elements of the story while sacrificing the words. If you go back to the original BBC presentation, those people knew how to punch the dialog so that each joke had focus. It the movie version, a lot of the humor is just thrown away. And the biggest complaint I have is that the worst element of the original series is the pathetic second head on Zaphod, yet the movie doesn't do any better with it--the second head still looks stupid. And Marvin looks wrong: he doesn't look paranoid or depressed; he looks like a vampire bowling ball. Other than that, the cast is great, but so many of the gags written for them are lame or delivered quietly without any zing, which is something that doesn't play well in a crowded theater with fatsos munching at bags of kibble sitting all around you. The ""wow"" factor of the new visuals is only really an ""ah."" And why didn't they subtitle the song the dolphins sing? It sounded funny, but who could make out all the lines? Anyway, I'm going back to my copy of the original show and my copy of the radio show and I won't look forward to the Guide in any other format until its publication as a cool talking book.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
195,tritisan,I am a happy camper,9,8 May 2005,"Hitchhiker's was my favorite book back in my teens. I had the lowest of expectations when I heard the movie was coming out. I just saw it again last night, and you know what? It's perfect. It's brilliant. It's hysterically funny, in a multi-layered way. The characterizations are dead-on, exactly like I'd imagined them years ago. The visualizations are incredibly imaginative.Plus, the movie really stands on its own merits, regardless of the how familiar one may be with the books/TV show/radio version. It follows the long, wonderfully weird tradition of absurdist British humor. Think Monty Python, most of Terry Gilliam's films (especially Time Bandits), the Muppet movies (like The Dark Chrystal, a hybrid American/British production).Hitchhiker succeeds in transcending the usual cynicism, however. I left the theater feeling truly inspired, feeling like a wide-eyed child again. I think it sends a wonderful, deeply felt message, one that I would want my own children to understand.

The cast were great. Even, surprisingly, Mos Def as Ford Prefect. The characters are likable enough and special effects are great. The film is played more straight than any previous version but there's still lots of fun to have.So its not as good as the book, radio series or even the flawed TV series but still it may just introduce a new generation, obsessed with rubbish like Harry Potter, to the genius of the late great Douglas Adams.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

Just before the Earth is about to be destroyed so the Vogons, an extremely bureaucratic and cranky race, could pave an pan-galactic highway, he and his friend Ford Prefect hitch a ride off the planet. They eventually board the Heart of Gold, the advanced spaceship stolen by ego-maniacal President Zaphod Beeblebrox.Douglas Adams died of a heart attack while he was writing the screenplay, so much of the movie is very close to the book, including many of the jokes and large pieces of dialog. He took some pieces of several of the books to make the movie. He also added Humma Kavula, a political rival absent from the novels; and a little love story between Arthur and Trillian (the only other survivor of the Earth) which seemed to be missing all along.Some creative casting put rapper Mos Def as Ford. Sam Rockwell is very funny as Zaphod. Alan Rickman is perfect as Marvin the Paranoid Android. Martin Freeman is well cast as the loner Arthur Dent, and Zooey Deschanel is good as the pretty sidekick Trillian.The opening song, ""So Long and Thanks for All the Fish,"" sounds like something out of a Monty Python sketch.Stay through the credits.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

Pity author Adams passed away before its completion, but several of his movie ideas made it into the final cut (he'd been working on a film adaptation for over a decade, only to have the project get stalled time after time).As a fan of the low budget - but infinitely charming - British Hitchhiker TV series, I enjoyed seeing that show's original Arthur Dent turn up in a cameo. Even the bits added by filmmakers and not found in other incarnations of the tale - like the planet programmed to punish any original thoughts with a terraformed swat to the face, or the gun that forces its target to engage in truthful self-reflection - fit well with Adams' generally spoofy and irreverent tone.While I'll always prefer the original books, the movie is at worst ""mostly harmless.""

Enjoyable performances by Sam Rockwell as Zaphod Beeblebrox, the galactic president as played by George-W.-on-acid, and Alan Rickman as the voice of Marvin, the extremely depressed robot.

He informed me that this peculiar song originated from the newest fad film, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. It took me 12 more years to finally sit down and watch the film that has been considered a cult classic. The film is entertaining and choc full of British humor. Sadly, that is where the praise stops. I was constantly distracted by the awkward transitions between scenes and by how bad the editing was. In several scenes, it is heavily apparent that several days passed between two shots from the same scene were filmed. Often, the character's emotions widely vary without reason and remind the viewer that none of what is happening on screen is real. Focus is another facet the film lacks. Protagonist Arthur Dent seems unsure of what his goal is during the course of the film. His purpose randomly fluctuates between finding love, finding home, and finding the meaning to life. All stories require an iota of consistency and, in this regard, Hitchhiker's does not make the cut.Lastly, Hitchhiker's requires a large amount of CGI and prop effects. I found the art department lacking. Some might try and defend the poor effects stating it was only released in 2005. But I remind you that The Matrix was released in 1999 and Men in Black in 1997. The original Star Wars trilogy boasts greater effects and predates Hitchhiker's. All in all, the film is worth watching, but I would not consider it remotely fantastic or a trendsetting.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

If you saw this movie and did not like it, please, PLEASE do not let it deter you from reading any of the books. That having been said, yes I've seen the BBC series and longed for it to be redone better. Little did I know how much I was hoping for!This movie has better production levels, but overall I must sadly report it fails to feel as if it was done 'better'. If anything, it falls short of the BBC mini-series (which actually covers the first two books). And I think that is saying quite a lot.I will be surprised if there are any more movies for the other books anytime soon, and that is the saddest commentary I can think of overall.applause goes to -- Stephen Fry as the voice of the book -- I should think the only acceptable alternative would have been Simon Jones, who still found a way into the movie. So all is good.Alan Rickman as the voice of Marvin -- I worried a bit at first, but he pulls off the sullen and depressed very well indeed.Sam Rockwell as Zaphod -- after having see the movie, I can't picture anybody else in the role. He was fantastic.The cameo's -- I'm sure we all enjoyed them. Glad to see a nod to those who did it before.raspberries go to --Mos Def -- I like him in what I've seen him in, and he does a passable job as Ford Prefect. The problem I have is just that, he only does a passable job. He's not quirky enough to make you feel like he's 'out there' a bit. He had comedic-quality and ready scenes and lines to lend a good bit more levity/comedic moments and missed dang near all of them.Martin Freeman -- whom I have not seen in anything else, played as boring and plain character as anybody could pull off. The pathetic parts weren't endearing of any sympathy, what should have been comedic stabs were either missed or delivered so boringly that they rolled by like a tumbleweed. Once in awhile he did shine, but by the time those moments came along they caught you by surprise and you'll be lucky if you don't miss them. Bill Nighy -- Another actor I've liked in about everything else, he just came across as bored, IMHO. Not everybody can be Richard Vernon, but Nighy's treatment seemed like he was doing this as a favor to somebody.The Director -- at who's feet I lay the blame of the pacing, the parts of story that were cut out completely and changed to make it more 'Hollywood' that it really didn't need. Not only that, but in any desperate hopes of the other books being made into movies the story line change involving Arthur and Trillian have scotched that. And making Stephen Fry slow down his narration doesn't say anything good about what he/they think of their audience. I get the distinct impression they at best read the book once, and quickly. What the movie probably didn't need was a 'big fan'...it would have turned the movie self-indulgent and cumbersome. But someone who could respect the book and its fans enough to stay closer to it would have been nice. And with Mos Def and Martin Freeman in the cast, it seemed to me the directed needed to have had a much stronger hand with his actors.Overall, yes we all understand time constraints do mean pieces of stories have to be skipped, cut, changed, whatever. And for the most part the ones I complain about missing are those of a fan. The story does actually work, there are NEW things in the story NOT in any of the books that Adam's was apparently working on for the movie before he sadly and suddenly passed.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
203,miloc,It works.,7,14 January 2007,"Many years ago the public radio station in my hometown ran the radio series of ""The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy."" The theme song, ""Journey of the Sorcerer,"" performed by a band that I otherwise loathe, to this day nearly brings tears to my eyes.Hence it is probably impossible for me to give an entirely objective review for this film. This great conception was first hatched in those jokey yet skilfully made broadcasts. Since then it has taken many forms, from a television show to a series of novels, to record albums, to a computer game, to (finally) a film, each time being reshaped and reimagined by its creator, the late and sorely missed Douglas Adams. He really hit on something: a vehicle by which he could not only satirize pettiness, bureaucracy, consumerism, narcissism, and uncounted other foibles of humanity, but also the pomposity of science fiction itself. His sense of humor was at once deeply cynical and deeply warm, and one of the most gratifying and surprising qualities of this film version is the obvious respect it shows for its author.Adams didn't live to see his creation hit this new medium, and yet the script he wrote seems not to have been, as might be expected, trampled upon by the filmmakers. The opening song is strikingly catchy and funny, the casting is excellent -- Freeman, Def, Deschanel, Nighy, Rickman, and especially Rockwell are ideal -- and the verbal wit, unusually intact, holds up.And we have the moment, most importantly, when the Earth itself is destroyed -- not in a mammoth explosion but in a nicely understated poof. That unexpected sound instantly lets you know the movie is on the right track. And then, in the starry darkness, that banjo begins to play -- and for anyone who ever laughed out loud at hearing a deep, melancholy metallic voice say, ""LIfe. Don't talk to me about life,'"" that sound will send a chill down the spine. Adams created that rare work that creates laughter and sparks the imagination simultaneously.

204,DesbUK,A Very English Galaxy,8,19 May 2005,"It's quite a joy after so much American science fiction like 'Independence Day', the 'Star Wars' movies and 'Star Trek' to enter a very English science fiction galaxy. This is a very British production. Shot at Elstree Stduios in England by a British director (Garth Jennings) from the the screenplay by the English writer Douglas Adams. It also features some wonderfully cast English actors, especially Martin Freeman as Arthur Dent and Stephen Fry's beautiful tones as the Voice of the Book. The look of the movie too is refreshingly un-Hollywood. Marvin and the Vogons are actors in costumes rather than CGI effects. When the characters land on Vogesphere,it isn't the fantastic worlds of Tatooine or any of the other lavish 'Star Wars' worlds: the planet looks like the abandoned quarry which used to represent alien worlds on 'Doctor Who'.But the casting of Americans in key roles simply doesn't work. Sam Rockwell is just awful as Zaphod Beeblebrox - a shouting, one-note unfunny performance (it really needed Richard E Grant or Gary Oldman). And Mos Def is uninteresting and uninterested as Ford Prefect (why not Simon Pegg or Hugh Laurie for that role). Disney - who financed the film - seemed willing to allow Jennings creative control and not change any of the British references (Ford Prefect, for example, is the name of a popular English family car from 1960s; or that Arthur thinks Ford is from Guilford), but in return seemed to have wanted Americans for several key roles.The film works best when it replicates the original material: the first third of the movie is almost a scene for scene, word for word recreation of the radio and TV series. The title song and sequence - with dolphins leaving the Earth singing 'So Long and Thanks for all the Fish'-is just brilliant.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
205,jmoney-2,Everything You Could Have Hope For,10,1 May 2005,"Thank God, this movie didn't suck.Since I've been waiting for the film adaptation of Douglas Adams' book for about 20 years, there was good chance I'd be let down (i.e. Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace). But I'm happy to report the film retains the essence and irreverent spirit of the book while at the same time being fresh, original and -- most importantly -- funny.The cast is superb. Mos Def is an off-beat choice for Ford Prefect, but he turns out to be the perfect Prefect -- friendly, easygoing but also ""street smart"" when it comes to navigating the universe. Sam Rockwell nails the role of Zaphod Beeblebrox, President of the Galaxy, who in this version is updated as somewhat of a parody of George W. Bush. For the character of Trillian, they could not have done better than the cute, smart, spunky -- did I mention cute? -- Zooey Deschanel. She's a girl you'd go to the end of the Universe for. Kudos to the character design department for their simple, brilliant depiction of Marvin, the depressed robot with a brain the size of a planet. Here he's just a stubby, little body with a big head and two downward-pointing triangles for eyes. Warwick Davis a.k.a. Willow (body) and Alan Rickman (voice) do the rest, wonderfully. Bill Nighy plays Slartibartfast just the way I imagined him. And holding it all together as Arthur, Martin Freeman is the perfect Joe Schmo. Using Jim Henson's creature shop to create the Vogons (instead of using CGI) was also a good choice.The script, which was co-written by the late Mr. Adams is faithful to the book, but different enough that it doesn't feel like you're merely listening to someone read the to novel to you. For the uninitiated, ""Hitchhiker's"" was the first novel in the five-book series and it really doesn't hold enough plot for a feature-length film. So, a brand new second act has been created. This meant the filmmakers didn't have to combine books, leaving open the door for sequels. The script also ramps up the love story and Arthur's heroics and adds a few more action beats. In other words, they made it into a MOVIE. And I didn't mind it a bit.Fans of the series will also appreciate a couple of nods to the BBC television version, including the use of the old theme song and a cameo by original Arthur, Simon Jones. So, to people who loved the book but who may be wary of the film, I say simply this: Don't Panic.And don't go anywhere without your towel.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
206,nowonmai42,"It's just this movie, y'know?",5,29 July 2005,"""The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"" has the feel of a movie that's taken the long route to the screen. The fact that Douglas Adams, deceased by a few years, gets both screenplay and executive producer credits would seem to confirm this. It's tough turning beloved cult texts into films, and ""Hitchhiker's"" is no exception. The good news for fans of Adams' interstellar celebration of absurdity is that the movie actually gets quite a bit right. Yet it suffers from an odd patchwork feel that makes the books virtually required reading to have the slightest inkling of what's going on.Any story involving the demolition of earth for an intergalactic bypass, planet-size supercomputers, infinite improbability drives, and poetry-reciting space creatures has a bit of explaining to do. Adams, gifted with a rare verbal dexterity, was in his books able to introduce and discard such elements with a comic insouciance that somehow more of less made sense. The film has a tendency to get stuck, though; it's neither able to juggle all this goofiness with Adams' deft touch, nor provide any context for neophytes. Those familiar with the books will get, for example, what's so important about towels, and why Galactic President Zaphod Beeblebrox has two heads and three arms, and will perhaps forgive the film for its fairly muddled presentation of such. But ""Hitchhiker's"" is full of moments that will leave new initiates scratching their heads.The film makes the unfortunate decision to highlight the silliness through visuals, rather than Adams' offbeat dialogue. The effects and production design assume a deliberate cheesiness in an attempt to match the story's tone, but end up looking like a strange marriage of ""The Muppet Show"" and ""Dr. Who."" The movie is eager to cram in as many of Adams' comic bits as possible, but too often does so at the expense of continuity. It jumps from one oddity to the next, treating them more as sketches than parts of a coherent whole. Nonetheless, there are a nice realizations of a few of the author's delightful inanities, such as the pleasantly sighing doors of the heroes' spaceship, and a philosophical sperm whale destined for a tragic end.The jumble of activity that ""Hitchhiker's"" tries to balance leaves its characters, among them rescued earthling Arthur Dent (Martin Freeman) and his space jockey friend Ford Prefect (Mos Def), so occupied reacting to events that they can't create fully-formed personalities. Too often we get a punchline without the accompanying set up. A film adaptation of any book needs to be accessible to non-readers; it's unfair to rely upon viewers to fill in the blanks with a background familiarity they may not possess. Love it or hate it, ""Hitchhiker's"" fans will at least get the gist of this movie. For anyone else, though, the book, at a quick 200 pages, will be a far more satisfying and coherent alternative.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
207,Ellie-23,Marvin rules.,9,2 May 2005,"Douglas Adams 5 book trilogy contains so much subtle humor, outrageous behavior and deep probing wisdom making part of it into a film was a huge project. I have been waiting for several years to see if Hollywood could do a better job than the British did on the TV series. My husband and I are Hitchhiker junkies. We have the Books, the radio series on tape and the books on tape read by Douglas. I play the computer game on line when I can remember where it is. We enjoyed the film, the Vogon's are amazing thanks to Henson's creatures and the factory in Magrathea is enchanting.While my mental picture of Marvin was of a falling apart erector set type robot I loved the Marvin in the film anyway. The way he drooped when things go wrong (all the time) and how he zapped the vogons near the end. While it doesn't come close to reading the book the film is charming and worth seeing. I know I'll buy it on DVD. If you don't understand the film, READ THE BOOKS.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
208,tramsbottom,Those Cheeky Mice And Their Excellent Film,7,18 April 2005,"Overall a tremendous success. It's very funny, very kooky and visually gorgeous. I saw it with about 2000 media persons and we all loved it, which is a pretty hard thing to accomplish.If you've never read the books (and I suggest you do, it moves at such a pace you might find yourself going 'eh?' a lot) then I don't know what you'd make of it. Think Monty Python in space, or a very British version of The Fifth Element.As an adaptation I think it works extremely well though there were a few confusing moments even for me as the large philosophical questions were crammed into two hours worth of movie. The new stuff is cleverly done and works a treat IMO.The cast: never been a fan of the office but Martin Freeman is perfect as Arthur Dent, Sam Rockwell hilariously OTT and Mos Def a surprising choice but one that really works. Trillian isn't that important in the novel and the movie bumps up her role to a love triangle situation between her Arthur and Zaphod. Again, Deschanel is an odd choice (another yank) but she is utterly spellbinding (oh the shower scene...hubba hubba).The FX are great, both CGI and the Jim Henson creatures (the Vogons, brilliantly voiced by The League of Gentleman). The opening title song is worth the price of admission alone (think Eric Idle at his peak).So I loved it, though the ending is also a bit of an anti-climax, but only perhaps because I was expecting something bigger. Still, it's p***-funny and that's the main thing.Best moment: Ford attacks the Vogons with a towel and foils them by closing a tiny garden gate (""Oh no! We'll have to go around!"").",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
209,FloodClearwater,Couldn't the Vogon Have Scheduled This Film for Demolition?,2,28 August 2015,"This film, an adaptation of the much-loved humorous space travelogue of the same title, is co-written by none other than the author, Douglas Adams, himself. This film is also no good, and that hurts. Neither funny, nor dramatic, neither well shot in cinematographic terms nor well-dressed in terms of costume and lighting, the movie squanders the best efforts of Martin Freeman as ""Arthur Dent,"" the only human rescued from the scheduled demolition of Earth by a trio of spacefaring wanderers. Before getting specific, let's concede that the book has always stood out as a tough one to film. Adams's story in the novel is demure and the empty space of prose is filled in by his elegant, stylish writing, a style that encourages the reader's own imagination to fill in many gaps. Adams the novel writer also tilts toward the whimsical. He presents the gravest danger in the galaxy as being forcible poetry readings by a particularly un-lyrical alien race. But let's not make excuses for Adams, the other writers and editors, and director Garth Jennings. Lots of stories are challenging to film. Take the example of Men In Black. Men In Black is the polar opposite of this story, but with the same zany, over-the-top whimsical sci-fi sensibility. In MIB, really wacko aliens visit Earth and threaten the human race's naive, cloistered, square, buttoned-down understanding of our existence and specialness. The Hitchhiker story is MIB in reverse: a human travels off Earth and is confronted by the reality of the wacko aliens on their home court. So how is MIB a terrific film, where this Hitchhiker is, keeping the with theme of opposites, a total reclamation project? The answer is this The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy misfires in so many ways, none of which have to do with the noble but ultimately futile efforts of the actors to brass things out. The opening sequence, or performing porpoises backed by a 1930s Broadway-sounding chorus tune, sets an incongruous mood. Stephen Fry's omniscient narration sounds twee, and not at all galactic. As soon as we leave Arthur's doomed patch of a doomed Earth, which is shot and lit like the town square in a claymation Bob the Builder episode, the leads are thrown into a dank, slimy, creepy, blubbery, but especially creepy starship environment as guests of the Vogon, Jabba-like beings the filmmakers rendered so large that they defy staying in a framed shot. Now the yecch factor of the worst moments of David Lynch's Dune are upon us. Then it is back to a spic and span white bulkheads and sliding space doors environment on board the actuually-cool looking starship of Sam Rockwell's Mick Jagger-meets-Little Richard-like character, Zaphod Beeblebrox. Now the mood is good clean fun in space, a la Spaceballs, but the direction mis-shoots the actors as they try to form pairs and triangles of interesting dialogue space, and that dialogue is, sorry Mr. Adams, flat and directionless. This film could have worked. It could have been the galactic Willy Wonka. It could have been Men In Black writ even larger. But it is a poorly made, dreary, ponderous film from every angle.If only the Vogon could have scheduled this film for demolition instead of Earth, think where we would be then.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
210,SoutheastUK,Disney butchers yet another classic...,3,2 June 2006,"I wonder how many at Disney actually took the time to read the books because they appear to have missed the point and simply cut out what they didn't understand (which is about 80% of what the film is supposed to represent).Sam rockwell and mos def were very poor choices to represent Zaphod and Ford. Rockwell simply doesn't have the talent to carry it off and Mos doesn't have the range.Zooey Deschanel dragged us through 1 1/2 hours of a performance clearly indicating that the deschanel sisters 1 dimensional acting traits are alive and well (as indicated by the last few films they've both starred in and the appallingly lack-lustre ""bones"" in which sister Emily ""plods"" from ""tooth-itchingly cringing"" scene to ""oh lord help me I cant find the remote"" scene). Eye-candy is a point for debate and one which zooey - aside from having breasts - loses it has to be said.Hats off to Martin Freeman and Bill Nighy. They probably helped save this film from complete disaster. But to be honest, this film was significantly beneath them given their abilities and the standards of the other actors. Stephen Fry was - as always - a great narrator. Most writers know that selling their stock to Disney is generally a bad move (given Disneys track record). Douglas Adams certainly did. Hopefully, his experience (and the experiences of others) will help other writers take a different path and prevent this sort of thing from happening in the future, given the increasing number of film companies.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
211,Hairy_Lime,Panic,4,21 August 2006,"It makes me very sad that I did not like this movie; I am a huge fan of all five books in the incredibly misnamed Hitchhiker trilogy.Where did the movie go wrong? Well, casting Sam Rockwell, for one. I wanted to bash his heads in with a rock throughout the film. Yes, Zaphod is supposed to be annoying, but not that off-putting.Second, the plot seemed to be missing a few pieces, somewhere. As in, the end features Trillian and Arthur together - big change from the book, but I'm fine with that - and... Zaphod with the Vice Preisdent? Did I miss something? Yeah, she clearly was jonesing for him during the movie but... what? SOMETHING had to happen. Maybe in the director's cut.But frankly, the problem was that the whole thing never felt silly enough for me; it's like the actors felt they were in the middle of some high art feature. They should have been having FUN, and that fun should have been evident on the screen. Instead, it was flat, featureless and... God but I hate to say this, dull.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
212,schmimic,"Based on the bestselling Douglas Adams book, this proves that British humor is still the best.",10,1 May 2005,"Starring: Sam Rockwell, Martin Freeman, Mos Def I wanted to see this movie from the instant I saw the trailer for it. I thoroughly enjoyed the books, and when I saw the preview, it looked like Hollywood was going to actually hold true to the integrity of a book and make a good movie. Fortunately, this was, in fact, the case.So for those of you who don't know the story, this is about how it goes. Arthur Dent (Freeman) is just an ordinary British chap. He wakes up to find a fleet of bulldozers ready to demolish his house to make way for a new highway or bypass or something like that. In protest he lays down in front of the bulldozer, and that's where his friend Ford Prefect (Def) finds him. Ford takes Arthur out to the pub and confesses that he is, in fact, from a different planet. He also tells Arthur that Earth is about to be demolished by the Vogon fleet to make way for a new interstellar bypass or something like that. Ford sticks out his thumb to hitch a ride, and the two of them end up in the bathroom of one of the Vogon ships just in time. And then Earth goes boom.Once the Vogons find the hitchhikers onboard their ship, they bring them out for torture of the worst kind. Which means they tie them up and read Vogon poetry to them. After that they decide to eject Arthur and Ford out into space, where they are picked up by the Heart of Gold spaceship, which is equipped with an infinite improbability drive. On board the ship are the President of the Galaxy, namely Zaphod Beeblebrox (Rockwell), Marvin the paranoid android, and Trillian, also known on Earth as Tricia McMillan. Arthur and Tricia have actually met before. In fact, Arthur and Zaphod have met before too. Zaphod is the guy who stole Tricia away from Arthur. But I digress.It's pretty hard to describe the rest of the movie because it doesn't really follow any rational logical plot. The plot is just like in the book. Very loose, very absurd, and really just a vehicle the jokes, of which there are many.Some people will hate this movie, and some people will love it. I suspect that the people who enjoyed the book will also enjoy the movie, and people who dislike absurd, idiotic, Python-esquire humor will dislike this movie.I for one, am a huge fan of that kind of humor.Bottom Line: 4 out of 4 (a must see)",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

Stephen Fry's droll narration is always a delight, whatever the occasion - film, TV series, Royal Command Performance - so that was fun, especially the teasing bits of information that left you hanging for later in the film (If humans were the third most intelligent species on the planet, and dolphins were the second, who are the first? was a good example). The sentimental love story was really cringing and they could have cut it all out, turning it into a much more cynical film. Just imagine what a Red Dwarf take on it would look and sound like. On the other hand, something that also could have worked is a Wallace & Gromit surreality with a much more English flavour than the current compromise for an American market. That said, John Malkovitch was a truly scary character (""Bless You!"") and some scenes had great clever gag appeal (you simply expected the caravan to take off, even if it didn't). In all, just a few giggles, a few scares and a romp through the universe that starts and ends with a cup of tea. It certainly is inconceivable that it could have been an American film.

215,MeloDee,Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy brought to life.,8,15 April 2006,"I really was unsure of what to expect when I asked my mother to bring Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy from the movie store from me. I had read the title book and sequel ""The Restaurant at the End of the Universe"" and I loved them both with a passion. The humor was fresh and the plot both zany and creative.When the movie began, my mind screamed in delight, ""Ooh, look, they got the dolphin scene right!"" A smile was instantly brought to my face, and remained there for most of the rest of the film.My concerns for the most part centered around the cast. The story is an extremely crazy one, and for actors to behave with reality within the environment would be a challenge. Additionally, I was not familiar with anybody who was playing in the movie.I was not at all disappointed. Martin Freeman was an excellent Arthur Dent- he was the man himself down to the last letter. I expected Mos Def to be a terrible Ford Prefect, but he did excellently. I liked Zooey Deschanel as Trillian. Sam Rockwell embodies Zaphod quite well- he reminded me just how insane the man could be! Don't get me wrong- the film does actually have faults. The book itself went into a lot more detail about things- this movie plot felt hurried and hashed in that respect. For example, the popular drink, the Galactic Garglebuster, was just showed once in the movie- I believe they drank it often. In fact, the Hitchhiker's Guide actually gives you an entire recipe and history on it.Then, there's when Arthur asked for a cup of tea from the machine. Small moment in the movie, huge in the book. The drink, of course, wasn't quite tea, and Arthur, British to the core and very dissatisfied, tried to school the machine on what exactly tea was, the history of it- everything. So when they reached Magrathea and were being shot at, the reason the ship was having so many issues was because a large percentage of it's power was being used in an attempt to make Arthur tea! For me, though, none of that (or the small divergences from the book in the movie) were of importance. I was enraptured by just having a perfect physical image of the Adam's universe to look at. Finally, the world I'd enjoyed so much was a reality. That in itself was priceless and fulfilled all I wanted.Unfortunately, this movie, to people unfamiliar with the original story, appears disjointed and confusing. Also, the changes made to the plot tend to be upsetting to more serious HHGTG fans.Personally, I would've given a 9 if they'd just taken the time to actually describe why Ford was carrying around the towel- that's a hitchhiker's most important possession! How they could leave out such a vital- and hilarious!- fact is a mystery.So barring that -and the initially creepy way they depicted Zaphod's second head- I just absolutely loved the film.So long so long so long (and thanks for all the fish!)",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
216,Syrchek,A 'wacky' and a bit tiring adventure,7,10 June 2005,"That's what was going thru my mind after seeing this movie. The sci-fi genre is probably the only one in which the creators are able and allowed to fully unlock their imagination. That was very visible in this film. You get the felling that the film tries to capture every part of the book. Events keep going on all the time and that bothered me a little bit. There are a lot of funny things in this film but I've felt that only few really got to me. Probably because they were served too rapidly.The humor was surprisingly more 'british' than I expected it to be. What I like about this movie is that it doesn't have a tag on it ""Oh look at me, I'm so funny"". Some things made me laugh (like the talking whale or ""Sorry, I've been watching TV"") and some didn't. The Vogons, the whale, the dolphins, Marvin, Deep Thought and many other 'nonhumans' were all funny and witty because they resembled human beings. But at some point, I'm not sure why, I found it tiring.I guess the search for the answer to the eternal question add a bit to that tiredness. There really isn't anything weak that I could find in this film but I would exaggerate if I claimed that it has tons of surpluses in it's genre. I still recommend it to the fans of sci-fi.

Aside from the book, there are TV series, radio shows, graphic novels, computer games, etc etc. One of the charms of Douglas Adams' way of working with these versions is to never to a straightforward adaptation. No two versions are exactly the same, the plot is always more or less different. So, it comes as no surprise that the long-awaited movie has a different plot to the rest, as well.The problem is that being compelled by the fantastic tone and feel of the books, you're driven to the other versions, and I for one am always slightly disappointed. I think it's because the plot and performances of the characters are secondary to the concepts and wild ideas that Douglas Adams was so dahm adept at spewing forth at every opportunity. So anything performance- and plot-driven will always seem lacking to me.Also, having seen, heard and read so many different versions of H2G2, the constant elements - Earth being wiped out by the vogons, vogon poetry, Magrathea, the ultimate answer being 42, the mice as commissioners of the Earth, the whale and the bowl of petunias etc. etc. - become old jokes. I've heard them so many times before that they're simply not fresh and interesting anymore. And that's a shame, because they ARE fresh and original.

Thankfully for this viewer at least that doesn't happen.For viewers living it the UK comparisons will almost inevitably be drawn between this movie and the TV series, but it should be remembered that they are both products of their times. Was really glad to hear that Journey of the Sorceror featured in this movie.Thought that Mos Def was a rather odd choice for Ford Prefect until I saw him. Although sometimes his delivery of his lines can seem a little lacklustre, his performance puts an interesting new twist on Ford's character. In fact what applies to him also applies to the characters of Zaphod and Trillian. In the books and series they all come across as being just a little too smug, but are much more likable in the movie.Sam Rockwell is excellent as Zaphod and the positioning of the second head makes an interesting and for the filmmakers anyway, a more practical solution to Adam's radio throwaway joke about Zaphod having two heads and three arms.Zooey Deschanel is excellent as Trillian and the scene at the beginning with the shorts and socks make rather pleasant viewing.Martin Freeman plays Arthur the way he should be played. The movie makers made a change from the book and series by making Arthur more assertive. By doing so this gives the gang a more ensemble feel, rather than the three smug members with Arthur trailing around.I may be pilloried for saying this, but there are aspects of the books which I didn't particularly like, mainly the very grim feeling that develops as the saga goes on and also Arthur's tendency to trail behind not knowing what's going on. Thankfully, these aspects have been removed and the story is much better for it.If this movie performs as well as hoped, the deserved sequel will hopefully happen and continue the saga.

Lets see the next one in this series!,8,1 May 2005,"Since I had read the 4 book series on Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, I was anxiously awaiting this movie and saw it in one of its first runs at a local movie theater.It is an exceptional movie! While the Hitchhiker books were excellent and fun reading, the books often seemed disjointed to me and hard to follow. Somehow with the movie script, all of that was cleared up and the movie flowed smoothly and very well done from scene to scene. So, in some ways, the movie is even better than the books.As to what genre the movie is would be hard to say. I am not sure that I have ever seen another movie in this exact category. It seemed a well-done British sci-fi fantasy comedy. What? Exactly! However, even though it might have created a genre all of its own, it does very well. The ""human"" makes a straight man for the humor in the highest caliber, and the robot, is well, ""unique"" as it was portrayed also in the books.One more thing that I look for in great movies is creativity, and this movie definitely has that. The Vorgon aliens in this movie were truly out of this world! I will bet that many other sci-fi movie makers are wishing they had invented this Vorgon race. Unbelievable, humorous, and unexpected facial expressions to match. Magnificent!

I thoroughly enjoyed this film. It did follow the book, but allowed the actors interpretations of their characters to give the film a spark of life.I was pleasantly surprised, and even impressed, with the portrayals.For any fans of the book, I recommend this movie. This is not a case of the movie being a an insult to a great story. This project placed the characters of Adam's piece into very capable hands. The actors bring those characters created in a wonderfully witty story to life on the big screen.If you have never read the book, you will probably be lost. Certain aspects of the movie are not explained in detail, so knowing the book will make the story more understandable. If you do not like the book, do not watch the movie.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
227,geraldclare,Great and Imaginative,9,14 May 2005,"Hello Moviegoers, This is Gerald. Been waiting for me to like something? Well I loved Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. It was great fun. Clever dialogue, interesting ideas and absolutely terrific graphics. Now while this picture does address some serious existential issues, the meaning of life and all that jazz, be forewarned that this is an exceptionally silly movie, think Monty Python does Star wars.The basic story is that Earthling Arthur Dent is whisked off the Earth, by his friend Ford Prefect an alien he has unknowingly befriended,moments before it is demolished to make way for a galactic public works project. Well, if you liked the bar scene in the original Star Wars, you're going to love Hitchhiker. It's full of strange and amusing creatures. But looking at some reviews and online comments it's clear that some people take movies just a little too seriously. Hitchhikers guide to the Galaxy. Clever, Fun and attractive, that's enough for me.

228,Klaatu-18,Don't forget your towel,9,30 April 2005,"I was first exposed to the ""Hitch-hiker"" series when I attended the 1979 World Science Fiction convention.The convention that year was in Brighton, England. When I got my ballot for the Hugo Award I saw this radio show listed among the nominees and thought it a bit of ballot box stuffing by the host country.When I got to the convention it seemed as if at least one quarter of the people I met were encouraging me to check out the show. Each would tell me a comedy bit from the show, but no spoilers.The show ran twice: once broken up into two three hour sittings and then a six hour marathon. I missed the first runthrough but caught the second. Douglas Adams came on beforehand and talked about the genesis of the story and he answered questions.It was incredible. Funny is hard to do in science fiction: some stuff that was intended serious turns out ridiculous, and the comedy bits often fall flat.Once I got back to Texas, I told all my friends about this great show I had heard. I would have to wait a year to get my first tapes -- a two tape set that covered the first four episodes. Eventually there were the books, the TV series, and more books. Oh, and two albums (a double and a single) that covered the first six episodes.One of the fun things about all these versions was their inconsistency. The chief one of these was what happened to our heroes after they left the Restaurant at the End of the Universe. In both the radio and TV versions, they steal a spaceship. But in the former it belongs to the commander of an alien battle group and in the latter it was Hotblack Desiato's stuntship.So, considering this changeability, I wasn't too upset with any changes to the storyline. Even the slight changes to the characters didn't bother me. I got 80-90 per cent of the original version, and most of the rest was consistent with what I've come to expect from the series.I once saw Stephen King. This was just before ""The Shining"" came out. My friend Larry Lankford asked King if he was concerned about what Kubrick might do to the story. He said no, that there was always the original book.That's the way I feel about this movie. It was as good as I could have expected from a Disney movie: tone down the cynicism of the original a bit, and give it a happy ending. But, at the end of the day, there's always the TV show, those records, the books and the original radio incarnation. There's more bits, funny lines, and adventures waiting for the newly initiated.I kind of envy them the journey. But I hope that they won't forget to bring their towels.Nine stars. Can't wait for the DVD.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

230,quatermax-1,an almost happy compromise between British eccentricity and Hollywood demands...,6,7 February 2008,"This was a tough one for me. I was an avid fan of Douglas Adams' original BBC radio series, the much more complex books which spawned as a result, the audiotape version (which differed again from both) and the resultant TV series (which differed yet again). For every incarnation Adams rewrote his story. So, as this new adaptation is supposedly based on a screenplay and detailed notes by the late Douglas Adams himself, with additional help from Karey Kirkpatrick, we should not be surprised that a movie version would yet again rewrite everything that has gone before - and it does... but you can't help wondering how it would have turned out if Douglas had been around to oversee it.As a condensation of the story/stories, which it obviously has to be for the format, a lot of it works. A lot of character interplay is tossed aside yet the basic relationships, though rushed, remain fairly intact. Freeman is okay as the bewildered Earthman Arthur Dent who is ripped from his mundane existence, yet is never as astounded or astonished or 'What the f***ing hell is going on!!!' enough to merit credibility or elicit any sympathy. He seems quite happy to go along with everything that happens to him. He is a deserved loser. Rockwell doesn't exude any of the charisma necessary for his character to have become a Galactic President, and simply plays it for laughs; Ford Prefect, an important character in previous incarnations, is totally unexplored and fades into the background, and there is an entire, and totally unnecessary, subplot, designed to insert the presumably available big name John Malkovich, the sole purpose of which seems to be the introduction and retrieval of a mysterious gizmo called a Point Of View gun, so that some of the characters can fire it at each other and experience each other's said Points of View in a WAY too long sequence toward the close of the movie. Adams would never have laboured a point, or a joke, in this way.Bill Nighy's Slartibartfast is a laugh, and the planet building sequences are suitably impressive. The relationship between Arthur and Trillian, before now unrequited, is developed more than it has been before and there are also some nice nods to previous efforts with the 'original' Arthur making an appearance as the 'Ghostly Head' and the TV series Marvin standing in the queue of various aliens having to deal with Vogon bureaucracy. The Vogons themselves are also wonderfully realised by Jim Henson's Creature Workshop and the voice talents of Richard Griffiths (HARRY POTTER series (Uncle Vernon), SLEEPY HOLLOW, THE NAKED GUN 2½: THE SMELL OF FEAR) and members of the BBC's LEAGUE OF GENTLEMAN cast, amongst many others.It was also disappointing to see a movie of THE HITCHHIKER'S GUIDE with so many of the GUIDE segments, which were the funniest bits of the books and the previous series, excised, but I realise that these would have been inappropriate and would have slowed down the action in some segments. One of my favourites, the explanation of the translating Babel Fish, does however turn up as an extra entry in the special features.Whilst the makers' enthusiasm and love for Adams' work is beyond question, as evidenced by the material in the special features, there still seems to be something lacking. What non-aficionado's will make of it is anyone's guess as so many characters and premises are introduced at a rate of knots, and being forewarned is definitely a help. On the whole though, and on second viewing, it's not too bad, and an almost happy compromise between British eccentricity and Hollywood demands.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
231,Listen_to_the_Law,Fun from start to finish,7,30 July 2007,"What a fun, random, and free-spirited movie The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is. The story of Arthur Dent (Martin Freeman), a man who gets swept off the earth mere seconds before it's destroyed to make way for a high-speed universe transportation network, is random, to say the least. On his adventure, Arthur flees alien controlled ships and harmful alien-like creatures, and eventually lands on a stolen future space-y ship with Trillian (a woman who is his love interest), and Zaphod Beeblebrox, (Rockwell), the president of the universe who is a hilarious character. It was Beeblebrox who was unintentionally responsible for the destruction of the universe and the thievery of the ship, which makes you laugh with and at him all that much more. Throughout the movie, a narrative voice reads the story to us like a book, because the movie was made from a book. The whole thing is hard to explain-- it's like it's got this certain feeling to it that has to be experienced. The special effects are also used perfectly. Bottom line is that this is a very fun little film, but clearly there are people who wont like it because there isn't enough sex or violence. Sad.Good) very fun, nothing like it, random (!) Bad) a bit too random, could've used more story development 42) The answer to life, according to Deep Thought, a titan-sized computer voiced by Helen Mirren",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

I eventually witnessed the end and it was worth it. The producers made a very wise choice of having Douglas Adams adapt his own story and it worked perfectly. What also highly impressed me was the cast the idea of using a young leading cast who mostly up to this time had mostly supporting roles but Martin Freeman, Zooey Deschanel, Mos Def and of course Sam Rockwell, The supporting and more experienced cast also did a fantastic job especially Alan Rickman who made an absolute hilarious performance and also was able to prove to the people who judge him that he can play other roles thats not a villain. So overall it was a joy to watch and may get many people to get interested in the story's by Douglas Adams.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
234,SammyK,"A noble effort, but ultimately flawed",7,4 May 2005,"Let me first confess that I will forever be a devoted fan of Douglas Adams' beloved ""Hitchhiker"" novels (the first three, anyway), and that going into this film I was expecting the worse.I mean, how can you honestly expect to properly translate Adams' witty, tangential writing to the literal, visual medium of film. The BBC mini-series aside, many have failed at adapting verbose satirical novels in the past. Just look at ""Breakfast of Champions"" or ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"" and you'll see what I mean. The intentions are always good. It's just that the subject material doesn't lend itself well to the translation.So you could understand my feelings going into Garth Jennings' ""The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy."" Upon seeing the film, my reaction was divided. On one hand, I was relieved that the filmmakers understood Adams' subtle humour, and made it their task to include several of the books' larger sight-gags (the improbability drive, babel fish, sentient missile-cum-sperm whale). I was also happy to see several nods to the BBC mini series. However, something was missing. And I couldn't decide whether this was the filmmakers' faults, or the adaptation dilemma rearing its ugly head again.At its worst, The Hitchhiker's Guide is an incoherent mess. The exposition is muddled, and the average viewer is left wondering the significance of certain key devices. For instance, the importance of the towels' is completely lost on us, and simply becomes an absurd prop. The same can be said of certain characters. Zaphod (the usually brilliant Sam Rockwell, slumming it here) is unbearably annoying (even more than the book affords him), and comes across as a coked-up actor mugging for a non-existent audience. And what is the significance of the Humma Kavula sub-plot? It adds nothing new to the plot, and if anything, complicates things unnecessarily. It also makes literal what was originally a throw away joke from the novel - the Jatravardians worshipping a giant sneeze.At its best, The Hitchhiker's Guide loyally illustrates the larger set pieces of the novel. The Vogons are nicely done, with help from Jim Henson's creature studio. And Marvin the Paranoid Android is brilliantly rendered by the voice of Alan Rickman (although I still prefer the look of the BBC mini-series Marvin). Arthur Dent is nicely played by Martin Freeman. And the ""Guide"" sequences are expertly done.So yes, my feelings were mixed. Ultimately, the sequel may be able to wrap things up a bit nicer. We'll see. It's a daunting task.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
235,gravity3,A Filmmaker's Guide to Catastrophe,2,20 December 2005,"While having a big budget rarely guarantees a film will be good, it generally seems likely there will be entertainment value, even at some basic level. HITCHHIKER'S GUIDE TO THE GALAXY does look expensive, but that's about as far as it goes. There is no discernible plot (that was left in the book, and those who've read it will need a good memory to fill it all in), no characters of interest (save the only film's laughs from Alan Rickman's one-liners), and no reason given as to why we should watch one minute longer.This has to be the dullest sci-fi/comedy/whatever movie I've seen in a decade. It's a painful exercise in movie watching stamina, and I had to take several breaks just to ease the frustration, all the while hoping, given the source material, it would get better. Rest assured, it does not.Rickman, Zooey Deschanel (I liked her in ELF) and the usually good Sam Rockwell seem like they're just improvising until they get the next page of the script that never arrives. Clearly director Garth Jennings hasn't the experience with actors to motivate interesting characters on screen, and no wonder: coming from a music video background, he's never had to work with them.Perhaps that explains Rockwell's impersonation of a rock star. It would also explain why there's no story here, since videos don't need them and rarely have them. I don't blame Jennings, but the new system that hires music video directors and expects they know things about film making that don't exist in the other medium. The director does know how to put pretty images on the screen, and there's a good soundtrack, but again these are the qualities of a music video, not a film.Unless you want to see a film that looks like it was assembled by the Infinite Improbability Drive, stay away from HITCHHIKER'S. If you're looking for good sci-fi/comedy, try GALAXY QUEST (also with Sam Rockwell and Alan Rickman) instead. But if you want the HITCHHIKER'S story, you'll have to read the book. It seems to have been left out of this movie entirely.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

Marvin the paranoid android (who is my favourite character in the original series) was absolutely pathetic in the film; his voice didn't have the depressing down-beat tone of the original and I think he also looked rubbish.I confess that I switched this drivel off after one hour, I just couldn't take it anymore. I'll stick to the proper series in future, far more superior.Sorry this isn't a decent review, I just wanted to say how disappointed I was by this rubbish.An insult to the original series.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
237,johnmcc150,Sadly only a small probability of it disappearing to another planet,3,2 January 2008,"I wisely waited until it appeared on TV. Douglas Adams had a streak of genius and the result was the inspired first BBC radio series which strung together his wit with an extremely thin plot line. The books and the BBC-TV series gave Adams's jokes a wider audience, mercifully with only a few changes and so HHGTTG achieved great popularity. As a result some of the lines have passed into everyday speech, in the UK at least, and are quoted as often as the Python's dead parrot sketch e.g. (""Life, the Universe and Everything""). Sadly Adams's genius dried up and so he worked on recycling his one great idea as a film, but the decision to exhume this material and make it into a film was a poor one. What everyone forgot is that radio is a verbal medium and film isn't. Films need a plot but less dialogue. Consequently there was much necessary reinforcement and motivation of the characters. However the makers forgot that by deleting most of Douglas Adams's well-worn gags, they were removing the main reason why people liked HHGTTG in the first place. The result was an emasculated piece that only added a couple of great special effects and a slightly better plot. Anyone who had not experienced the originals must have been baffled and anyone who loved the originals must have been disappointed.Interesting that it was Simon Jones (the original Arthur Dent) who delivered the message about the welcoming missiles and that the original TV Marvin appeared in the queue at the Vogon office.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
238,DennisH,"Threw itself at the ground, but didn't quite miss.",7,1 May 2005,"First, my relationship to the source material; loved the books, liked the BBC series with it's flaws, and never heard the original tapes. I've been waiting for this film since 1990, so I'm sure that I would never be completely happy with any result. But I had hope for this movie because of something Hammer and Tongs said, they felt that the reason why the books were so popular were because everyone believes that they 'get it' better than anyone else. So true, sadly not everyone gets everything the same way.That being said, and acknowledging that Douglas Adams had a hand in most of the major script changes, I have to admit that I enjoyed the parts much more than the sum of it's whole.If you are not familiar with the HHGG Universe, I wouldn't recommend this to be your inaugural visit. It's too compressed and kinetic (Garth Jennings did just leave the video venue) to soak in the storyline. It has it's merits, and I'll discuss them by act.The Opening: The one consistency between all of the H2G2 scripts is how Arthur woke up one morning to find out from Ford Prefect that the world was about to end, so you better drink your three pints in a hurry. Well done, classic, and the transition to the Vogon ship was nearly perfect.When they made it to the Heart of Gold is when I felt the American influence was a little too strong. I've never seen Sam Rockwell be less than excellent until now; not that he was bad, but his performance seemed a little forced. Zooey was good as Trillian, although I always pictured her to be a little colder. Marvin...well, Alan Rickman's voice was more than adequate, but I never could see the robot model as Marvin.The Humma Kavula/Vogon Planet: To me, this is where the movie lost me for a while. Bits and pieces of the almost always inconsistent 'trilogy' were fit in for the fans, but the flow of the story went somewhere I couldn't fathom. Complicating it was that while I know Adams approved the Trillian/Dent relationship; it didn't feel right.Third Act, Slartibartfast and the mice: Okay, back to 'normal.' Things took a big change but oddly enough, except for the ending with Trillian and Arthur, the story culminated reasonably well (if you include So Long and Thanks for All The Fish). Thankfully they never mentioned the Planet Kricket.Overall: The directors clearly loved the books, and they brought individual pieces together in a respectable, if not brilliant, homage. The Voice and Graphics of the Guide were perfect, as was Martin Freeman as Arthur. Mos Def as Ford and Zooey Deschanel as Trillian worked better than I thought they would, Rockwell as Zaphod worked worse (which surprised me).For a fan of the books, see the movie, you won't be laughing like you do at the text, but you will smile in acknowledgment that the filmmakers laughed as hard as you did. If you haven't, I would recommend saving your money until the DVD.7/10",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
239,Tomlonso,Disappointing effort that looks good,4,15 February 2007,"I was warned by other comments here not to expect a duplicate of other ""Hitchhiker"" titles. That's fine by me. Telling a story on the printed page or on the stage is not the same as telling a story in a movie. But when you shift from one medium to another, there are certain things that need to preserved.Where this effort falls short for me is in the portrayal of the three main characters.In the movie there is no indication in the opening sequence why Ford Prefect has chosen Arthur Dent to save, rather than one of the other 6 billion people on earth. In other ""Hitchhiker"" versions, Ford and Arthur are boon companions. In this one, they barely seem to notice each other's presence. Additional scenes or dialog isn't needed to get the point across, just better direction.The other issue for me is Sam Rockwell's portrayal of Zaphod. Zaphod is annoying, but there shouldn't be cheering when he's not in the shot.The second best thing about the movie is the Vorgons. They are puppets made by the Henson Company and show that CGI is not the answer every time.The best part of the movie is Douglas Adam's wit and imagination, which still shines through despite the problems.Mark Tomlonson",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
240,deadmanjones,"this review is not a review, but don't panic",6,2 September 2006,"For once I am bereft of an opinion. Or at least of the desire to give one. I grew up with a Hitch Hikers that was amoral, sarcastic, satirical and unenlightening, and I loved it. Come to think of it, given my sobriquet and my limited social circle, it probably shaped my entire dour demeanour. The movie has all the same lines, much of the same plot, but adds love, adds an alternative for 42, adds emotion and adds an orchestra heavy in violins. I should hate it, and I think I do, but everyone else in the cinema really enjoyed it. So let me put it this way. If you have grown up with the radio series and memorised the albums, this film may be disconcerting, and may well fill you with bile and hatred. If you haven't, you may be about to hear some very funny, if heavily edited, jokes. But the plot isn't going to make a damn bit of sense.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
241,elfflame,"No, it's not the book. Nor was it ever meant to be.",8,23 June 2007,"This was a movie I've been looking forward to for a very long time. My family used to listen to it every night when it was on NPR, and I've always adored it. I have two things to say before I go on to the spoilerish stuff. One is that it was fabulous, and if you like the series in any form, you should go see it. The other is that Douglas Adams would have loved it. And that, beyond anything else, is a great reason to see the film.Let's start with what I wanted from this movie. I didn't expect a faithful recreation of either radio-play or book, as both end rather on cliffhangers, and wouldn't work well for a movie. I did expect most of the same basic storyline. Man wakes up to find house about to be smashed down, friend comes to save him, house gets smashed, Earth gets blown up, he and friend are captured, he and friend are saved via ship, ship takes them to strange planet, where they learn that Earth was just a construct. It was all there. And more.As for the actors, the actor they chose for Arthur (who played one of the ""body-doubles"" in Love Actually) was perfect. Maybe not as exclamatory as he could have been, but bewildered and funny, and there. Alan Rickman, who did the voice of Marvin, was great, but was cheated again, as there were so many great Marvin lines that had to be cut to make way for the changes in the story line. Zaphod (who acted with Rickman in Galaxy Quest as the ""extra""), was really pretty much perfect. Obnoxious, egotistical and brainless. Exactly how I pretty much see Zaphod. Trillian, on the other hand, just seemed wrong to me. I didn't want a brainless bubblehead like the had in the BBC TV show, but I would have liked someone with a bit more energy, and a British accent, at the very least. She wasn't bad, I just wanted her to fit better into the cast, and particularly with Arthur, since he's her love interest. Oh, and for those who care, the original Arthur Dent, as well as the BBC TV Marvin show up in the movie. No, I won't tell you where, but keep your eyes open. :) On to the storyline changes...The storyline is much the same, but they took the overriding storyline that was the main focus of the first three books (the idea that Earth was a giant computer built to discover the Ultimate Question), and made that the ultimate focus of the movie. I thought they did an exceptional job keeping everything leading to that point. A few things got dropped along the way, and a few things had to be added, but not one scene felt like it couldn't have come from the books.For me, though, the most important thing about this series, and the thing I was most waiting to see and hear, was the Guide. After all, it is the title of the movie. And they did several entries, but there were whole sections of the movie where this idea seemed forgotten. The thing that made the original radio show stand out for me were the frequent breaks in the story where all action stopped, and the Guide took over. It was so different from anything that had come before it. It made the show more fun, and more interesting. Now, the entries they did were fabulous, but it quite disappeared in most of the sections where they'd created new scenes to explain some of the action. I think that to make this movie perfect, they would have had to add at least three more Guide entries.Other bits and bobs...Loved Ford arriving with the trolley full of alcohol and peanuts, and bribing the demolition crew with them. Loved the inclusion of the stories about how Arthur and Ford met, and how Arthur, Trillian and Zaphod met. Adored the Vogon Constructor Fleet, part, particularly the pub patrons lying down on the floor with paper bags over their heads. The Vogons were fabulous, but the poetry wasn't nearly dreadful enough (maybe needed more of a book entry, like in the BBC TV version?). ""Resistance is useless"" written seven years before Next Gen, thankyouverymuch... The Heart of Gold (and the sighing doors) was adorable. Trillian showing off the kitchen, with the particular highlight of the mini-lightsaber used to toast bread as you cut it. :D Eddie wasn't quite as up as he could have been. The Pan-galactic Gargle-blasters were perfect. I loved the inclusion of Zaphod's arch-rival, who turns out to be the leader of a certain church mentioned in the Guide... Slartybadfast (sp?) was excellent as well, and another actor who was in Love Actually, to boot.The ultimate scene, though, was when Slartybadfast took Arthur through Magrathea's planet-construction chamber. The scenery was amazing through the entire sequence.All in all, if you go with an open mind (or a Douglas mind?), I think you'll very much enjoy the experience.

But the 70 minutes that I endured left me yawing, and looking to identify with a character. The delightful Mos Def won the prize, but unfortunately had far too little screen time. As I exited the theater, a comatose Martin Freeman was still in his bathrobe, and the conniving 'party girl' Zooey Deschanel still undecided as to who she would end up with.

With the help of the Hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy, they join two other characters on a journey through the universe, with may mad cap adventures occurring.Considering that they crammed five books into one film, they have done a stellar job of keeping the great British humor intact, even though some great book moments were left out.

A lot of water (read:films) has passed under the bridge (read:across the screen) since the world first met Douglas Admas' creation - probably a lot ""inspired"" by Douglas Adams. If you haven't seen Brazil, The Young Ones, Fifth Element etc. etc., just go for it. If you have, poor acting and run of the mill effect make for a dull experience.

Having never read his work, I watched this movie from a very object oriented state. I assumed this was going to be a comedy with some sci-fi elements. Or maybe a sci-fi movie with some humorous anecdotes. What I got was an average sci-fi movie with very little laughs. I watched over an hour of this movie and I think I laughed twice (and both times I had to kind of force myself to). After that, I just couldn't finish it anymore.

Compared to the dreadful TV production, this was quite a relief. (By now, most people know that the books came _after_ the radio play). I think it was Ebert who remarked that in doing a movie like this, it's a tight walk in targeting both those who are intimately familiar with the original on the one hand - and those new to this weird and wonderful story on the other. The film team accomplished that tight walk pretty well. I especially appreciate the fact that they didn't slavishly adhere to the original. You have to throw fresh meat to us ravenous fans. Apparently the late Douglas Adams knew that, as well. Some of the screenplay was his.Pretty much everyone in the movie did a solid job. I especially liked (and was terrifically surprised at) the job that Mos Def did. Ford Prefect sometimes got just a tad annoying in the radio series, but Def is - while he was exasperating to Arthur - thoroughly likable: just the companion one would want while traipsing around the universe.*** Spoiler Alert *** The biggest of my admittedly minor disappointments was the ending. In the radio play, we leave the characters back at the beginning of earth's history with Arthur Dent saying, ""Oh well..."". In the movie, the writers/director/producer must have us see that - wait, no! - the Earth was not, in fact, destroyed. Everything is fixed up again. Very un-British.

I agree that there are flaws and mild disappointments (I loved Alan Rickman's voice but thought the robot's rotundity to be casting against type). I guess I was expected more of a Star Wars-type C-3P0.{The ""Guide's animated sequences are wonderfully reminiscent of Saul Bellows"" comment from the first ""critic"" seems totally wrong -- does he mean Shel Silverstein?

255,Frequency270,The long dark tea time of the adaptation,5,2 May 2005,"As a long time fan of the Hitchhiker novels, I'd really hoped for good movies, or at least a 'cult' style movie. Unfortunately Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy disappoints on both counts. The audience was a mixed bag, a couple of serious fans who loudly laughed at the smallest jokes, some who did a general low chuckle through the whole proceeding and one guy, I kid you not,loudly snoring for the last half of the movie. Now Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy 2005 is not great, but its not that bad. First the positives--top grade special effects and creature workshop. The only complaint there is Zaphod, whose double head is given short shrift. The entire creative team does seem to want to make the movie at least in the spirit of Adam's work. I excuse most of the cast, as they do seem to be trying their best. Unfortunately they're not quite up to the challenge. There is virtually no comic timing, with the occasional exception of Alan Rickman, and even he is not at his best. Lines are rushed and mumbled. The characters are either highly diluted versions of themselves (Such as Arthur and Ford)or completely different (Zaphod and Trillian). Ford has none of the sense of casual sass and wisdom, and comes off as a panicky neurotic. Not a hoopy frood. Zaphod, likewise lacks all things that made him cool and amplifies his negatives. Picture all the worse clichés you have heard about President George W. Bush, magnify them times ten, and you have Zaphod-including a pseudo-Texan accent. Arthur is far too normal,or at least his neurosis isn't focused on, which is a critical weakness. Zooey Deschanel is pretty, but she does not convey the strength of Trillian's character in the book. Here she seems to be just a foil for love, and to create some unneeded tension. John Malkovich,usually a scene chewer, is quite unremarkable here. Here is a single example that reflects the whole movie. In the beginning of the novel Ford Prefect persuades the person in charge of the demolishing team to lay down in front of the bulldozer in Arthur's place. In the movie,Ford plies the construction team with beer. The end results are the same, but the comedic delivery lacks. This persist through the whole movie. Additionally, the storyline, for those familiar with it, is far too rushed and compressed, moving character development far ahead of schedule. The original TV series, though operating on a fraction of the budget, preserved the spirit of the novels. If you have a chance, watch those. You'll be more amused. Overall, the only reason to see this in the theaters is the stunning graphics. Viewing priority: Movie rental, not as a new release.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

257,meako1973,Take your towel!,10,28 April 2005,"Arthur Dent is having, what could only be described as, a bad day! He was greeted, upon waking, by the rumble of trucks, and the sight of a demolition crew wanting to tear down his home to make way for a bypass. By sheer coincidence (something that plays a lot in Adams' 'trilogy in five parts') the Earth itself is also being demolished to make way for an interstellar bypass. No wonder all the dolphins have scarpered! Throw in the suddenly realization that his best friend is really an extra terrestrial, and you can understand why he may simply want to give up and throw in the towel.only it is possibly the most useful item any self respecting hitchhiker can carry! And so, finally,Hitchhikers Guide To The Galaxy makes its long awaited debut on the big screen. What began as a radio drama, was adapted to a book (with a few changes), transferred the jump to TV (with some cuts), and spawned 4 sequel novels, has been bandied around the film studios for over a decade. Adams himself worked on the script, and added a new subplot, and new details to give a new slant on the tale of the hapless earthman (played here by Martin Freeman), and his companions, Ford Prefect (Mos Def), Zaphod Beeblebrox (Sam Rockwell), Trillian (Zooey Deschanel), and Marvin (voiced by Alan Rickman).Reception to the film by the fans and critics has been mostly praising, with a few averages. A small few have picked at the 'missing jokes', thus missing the whole point of a film adaptation totally! Why describe the way a Vogon ship hangs in the air, when you can see it? As a fan since a very early age (saw the TV series on first run, then read the book straight after. Have read the series of books 6 times now, one more shot puts it on par with LOTR!) I had high expectations of the film. Suffice to say, it delivered!The casting is impeccable! Freeman gives a marvelous 'everyman' performance as Arthur, mastering the true art of bewilderment to a fine degree. Mos Def is suitably alien as Ford, with a quirky nature that makes you wonder why Dent didn't twig he wasn't right all along! Deschanel is enticing as love interest, Trillian, in some tweaks to the tale that have upset a few sad fanboys (in the book, Trillian wasn't his love interest). The stars of the show, however, are the deliriously manic Sam Rockwell as Zaphod, and Alan Rickman as Marvin. Rockwell is the greatest casting choice ever committed to film, giving a truly zany, annoying, and wild performance which ignites every scene he is in. Rickman's voicing of Marvin is suitably depressed, with hints of sarcasm, providing for some great delivery of lines. All this is without mentioning the support of John Malkovich, Bill Nighy, Steven Fry (as the voice of the book), and a quick cameo of Bill Bailey as the voice of the whale! Direction from Jennings is wonderful. The zany elements are given a great look, and whole look of the visuals are captured majestically. The true wonder of the space vessels, the planetscapes, and the interior design of the 'planet construction yard' are all presented beautifully, but with little quirks thrown in for good measure. The design of the effects are imaginative and skillfully crafted. If your jaw doesn't drop when the true majesty of the planet yard is revealed, then you must be numb to beauty! Throw in a glorious design of the 'book images' as it explains various elements, and a great use of the old theme tune, and this is a film worthy of the name.Fans can also have fun looking out for nods towards earlier incarnations with cast members from TV popping up, the original Marvin showing his face, and Doug Adams' face itself being the scape of a planet.If any complaint can be levied at the film it is that it doesn't feel complete. The new sub-story isn't resolved, and the feeling at the end is that we have only seen half a story. However, seeing as the book pretty much did this too, you can't really hold it against them. All you can do is hope it is a success and then Restaurant At The End Of The Universe can get made! Go see HHGTTG, and remember to bring a towel!",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

But who can dismiss such inspired things like the dolphin exodus, the violently idea-repellent planet, the moping robot, or the erudite book's hilarious explanations? The sheer density of the laugh-source material almost causes one's brain to overflow, so that it's actually hard to remember them all afterward.

For some reason Ford becomes black, Zaphod loses a head out of two he originally had and every joke that made the original show funny is made in such a way that it becomes anything but funny. Also much could have done with CGI. If they would have just replaced latex max with CGI and some futuristic look for some thing and just leave it to that that would have been great, yet they changed everything and butchered it without thinking just to make it fir the time frame.

In a lot of the scenes it just didn't feel like the characters were even talking to each other. Also a lot of what happened wasn't very well explained and didn't make a lot of sense. I've read all the original books but this film just didn't capture them. Also a lot of original dialogue was contrived and complex which when read as the printed word was very funny. However hearing much of it regurgitated word for word in a feature film sounded clumsy and forced. A good film maker should understand this basic point when adapting a film from a book. I quite liked Martin Freeman in it although he wasn't exactly the Arthur Dent of the books who is a rather hapless and uncool figure. Mos Def wasn't very good and I didn't understand much of what he was saying and the less said about Zooey Deschanel the better. OK, she's easy on the eyes but she can't act. Also letting Arthur get Trillian in the end was kind of the exact opposite of the whole original story. Arthur is the good guy who doesn't get the girl.

270,willsgb,"hey... fantastic man, psychedelic...",10,10 February 2013,"I first saw this in the cinema back when it was released with a couple of flatmates at uni who were massive HHGTTG fans, and i loved it enough to get the DVD which I watched again recently, and am now getting stuck into the radio play programme dramatisation thingy which started it all off and which I got from Audible and am thoroughly and utterly enjoying; the fun, memorable voice acting, the sound effects and music with an attention to detail that plunges you into the now famous story, which Douglas practically made up as he went along apparently... I can't get enough of it and I can see why it charmed so many people. I've seen the TV series a few years ago, which is full of that charm, a classic low-budget big ideas approach in a similar vein to Red Dwarf, and it was was a good adaptation, and my friend lent me the novel a while before that but I still haven't got around to reading it. I want to now, though.The film was my first experience of the HHGTTG story though, and I absolutely loved it, indeed it's one of my all-time favourite films. Perhaps I'm not as torn about the film as a lot of the fanbase who grew up with the story seem to be because this was indeed the first incarnation of the story which I saw/read/heard? Well, for me this film works. I'm very fond of and impressed by the considerable cast - Freeman, Rockwell, Deschanel whose role as Trillian made a big impression on me, Nighy, Mos Def, Malkovich, Stephen Fry, Helen Mirren, Alan Rickman and Warwick Davis, Bill Bailey, they all put their hearts into their roles however big or small, acted or voice-acted and enhanced the film, as did everyone else in it;The CGI was what CGI should be - something that makes you gasp, that brings fantastical things to life, rather then something distractingly obviously fake; take the Vogons demolishing Earth, or Slartibartfast and Dent emerging into the planet-building factory floor for example. the Vogons themselves and the sets and props were also pretty awe-inspiring in the way they brought the places and the people in it to life and immersive and engaging too and gave the universe in the story character and substance which made the film infinitely more enjoyable for me - I loved the big, slouched Deepthought, the pristine, technologically advanced starship Heart of Gold, the odd combination of swampy landscape and church/palace on Vitvodle 6 and so on.Also, some of the characters had an enduring impression; for example, although I love the TV series, I don't really like Zaphod in it, I don't know why, it just seemed like his actor wasn't entirely comfortable in the overacted, almost cabaret role. On the other hand, for me Sam Rockwell's Zaphod is one of the single funniest characters in any film i've ever seen, every single line, smug face, posture, little dance, faux pas etc. of his is priceless, the cocktail of his sheer brevity and idiocy hilarious, and movie Marvin is great too, although TV Marvin was truly marvellous himself, to be fair; like I said before though, Zooey's Trillian was enchanting even if she did get a bit overly cute at times, and Mos Def's Ford was a masterstroke, played to perfection; he just captured this sense of an intrepid blagger who absent mindedly ploughed on in his quest to document the galaxy for his book and who kept forgetting his mate Dent's ignorance of the bigger, crazier picture unfurling before his eyes and constantly tries to keep clueing him in. Meanwhile, Freeman played a very Freeman-esque Dent, which I think was also a very good idea. I loved little moments like him banging his head on the way down the stairs at the beginning which references the computer game, and the stereotypical old polite Britishness of a lot of his reactions, he was great.So all in all, I really loved this movie, with the so long and thanks for all the fish song, the awesomely animated and welcomingly narrated HHGTTG entries, the rich, vibrant and visceral way in which the universe of the story was brought to life on the big screen... it's one of those movies that doesn't get old, and to be honest I'm a little sad that no sequels were made, although many of the cast are now at the top of their game and if they could be brought back together in the restaurant at the end of the universe... nevertheless we'll always have this marvellous vision, those of us who loved it anyway! Yes, it adds parts like Humma Kavula, the detour to his planet and the POV gun, it introduces the Trillian Dent Beeblebrox plot and it changes the end of the Magrathea ultimate answer ultimate question etc. plot but what they changed worked for me, was funny and memorable and gave this film its own at least slightly distinctive identity in the pantheon of different HHGTTG stories told in the various mediums available to us.

The casting is superb, with the possible exception of Sam Rockwell, who quite frankly is irritating for large portions of his screen time. He needed to display a more subtle take on his character and remember that the Zaphod was a smooth operator; not a nutcase. Martin Freeman's take on the everyman Arthur Dent was right on the button; he nailed the bemused and bewildered manner perfectly. This will come as no surprise to fans of The Office. (His bemusement in the face of David Brent and Gareth was as funny as any of the mugging going on around him.) A special mention for Bill Nighy... a class act from any point of view.

It would have been all too easy to transfer the action to the mid-west of the US and put a full range of American actors in the movie - but the whole point of the book would have been missed. Essentially, the book plays upon the discovery by Dent that the universe is in fact just a bigger version of England - complete with pointless queueing and unlimited bureaucracy. Lastly, the visual effects are stunning and in one set piece (the ""factory floor"" - you'll know it when you see it) absolutely breathtaking -easily on a par with anything George Lucas can come up with... My rating is 42. Go and see it - its more than worth a couple of hours of your time.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
272,Richard-Nathan,Disappointing,5,1 May 2005,"I suppose the biggest problem was Martin Freeman as Arthur Dent. He played Arthur as a nice guy, but not a FUNNY nice guy. No comedic timing! Where was the resigned annoyance the character has had in all the other incarnations.The addition of a moral lesson (""carpe diem"") seemed out of keeping with the theme of the work. As Marvin might have said, ""Seize the day? Don't talk to me about seizing the day. The only point to seizing a day is to throttle it."" I know Adams himself went all gooey in ""So Long And Thanks For All The Fish"" - so maybe I should re-read that one, and try to look at this book in a different light, a rosy light.... oh God, I hate Rosy Lights.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
273,travis_iii,More stanzas of Vogon poetry than any other film of 2005,7,19 March 2012,"Inevitably this is a film that divides opinion. Without wanting to sound vindictive it seems to me that those who pan this film are, with few exceptions, zealots of the Church of the Immacculate Hitch-hiker; the sort of devotees who could quote large chunks of the original radio script word for word, and who, to my great annoyance at University in the 1980s, often did. Ironically, this only served to greatly diminish my fondness for the original three books which I had read and enjoyed as a teenager. I'm convinced Douglas Adams would have found the whole nerdy HHGTTG cult thing intensely amusing.But this film is OK - admittedly it's far from perfect, but it has enough good things going for it to make for a thoroughly enjoyable two hours viewing. Yes, it's patchy but it's very quirkiness, wittiness and humanity (Douglas Adams' star shines on) make it worth watching. The original Hitch-hikers Guide is a series of satirical sketches and monologues pulled beautifully together by the thread of some incredibly inventive sci-fi camp and, as such, it does lend itself to being condensed into a film format, albeit with the inevitable consequence that much gets sidelined... to the great chagrin of the cultists. I readily admit that problems abound with the imposed new narrative elements (mostly in the form of half-developed characters and skimmed over plot - much undoubtedly left on the cutting-room floor - Anna Chancellor's character was all but edited out entirely) and the film definitely sags badly in the middle after a very good first 45 mins, but this is countervailed by the wonderful cast, the big budget sfx (which are fun rather than mindlessly destructive as is the Hollywood norm) and a nice (though admittedly weak) romantic theme... oh! and those old troupers the Vogons (undoubtedly their best film to date).There are also one or two very good new jokes and new satirical bits (I think the Alternative Point of View Gun is new - I could be wrong) as well as plenty of the Guides monologues from the original (S Fry is a fine substitute for the sublime Peter Jones). What's missing of course are the large chunks of Adamsian hyperbole and ironic juxtaposition from the original - they're great and you can always find them in the books... or failing that pop down to any Student Union bar and at any given time you'll be able to find a group of science undergraduates who'll recite the books for you word-for-word... causing you to be instantly overwhelmed by a nostalgia for Vogon poetry.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
274,hawksburn,About a decade or so too late,3,19 October 2005,"The book was a product of its time. Written in the era of Thatcherism and Reaganomics. Most of the references for the humor are now out of date and unfunny. If this film was made in the 80's it would've possibly been of more relevance from a social commentary point of view.I loved the original show. I still have the BBC vinyl adaptation in my collection. So I too was hoping for a great movie to remind me of the great lines and humor I remembered from days of yore. But I guess I've just grown up, because none of what they left in there seemed funny any more.I say ""what they left in there"" because there were a great many brilliant quotable lines from the original that were left out or cut short. Even now when trying to over-exaggerate the size of something I use the ""It's soooo big, you just wouldn't believe how mind-boggingly big it is!?! I mean, you may think it's a long way down to the shop on the corner, but that just peanuts compared to...."". Or ""the Vogon spaceships hung in the air over the planet in exactly the same way bricks don't"".Christ, I love those lines as well as many others. The fact they were left out or cut in half means the filmmakers obviously didn't want their film to be too funny.The actors? Martin Freedman makes a great Arthur Dent. That display of English reservedness and resignation that things will be alright if he can just have a cup of tea. Only thing lacking was his annoyance factor. The original Arthur Dent was a nobbish whiny git for the most part. Freedmans Arthur is just a bit too....nice.Sam Rockwell does madcap very well, tho, and I thought this impossible, he tends to overdo it most of the time. The original Beeblebrox was an idiot but he was a cool idiot. He oozed smarminess. This one's just a hyperactive ADD child.Zoey Deschaniel and Mos Def mostly sleepwalk thru their roles unfortunately. I think there were better choices for Ford Prefect out there (black & white) and I don't think Mos Def cuts it. I thought his part in The Woodsman was great, but here, not. He recites his lines and movements as if he's still in rehearsal, it doesn't flow naturally.John Malkovichs appearance I really have no idea about. Why? What was the point. It contributed nothing worthwhile to the plot.It's disappointing when a well loved creation from your youth is reinvented sometime later and you find its just not funny.Competently made, but not funny.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

Still, the rambling soundtrack and 80s gloss of the TV series has been preserved to a brilliant effect and this I feel is a huge success considering the US production. No strangely familiar star ships zip across the screen, no spangly space travel - the depiction of the improbability drive deserves a round of applause, as it could have easily been written out as surplus, but instead it stays as an increasingly funny running gag.Hard to call a blockbuster, because it has no light sabers (TM) but it deserves to be seen as it is a brilliant adaptation and one of the best sci fi tales ever told.

""Wacky, zany, bizarre"" etc. But then they wanted it to appeal to the masses. Trillian and Arthur end up in a love story, Zaphod's turned into a prick, the plot is changed a bit, and the inclusion of slapstick humour. Even some new characters where made by DNA for the movie. You need to remember that H2G2 in every version has contradicted itself. Each form is a different entity, so this movie should be regarded in that sense. I can see what they did.---I personally don't like the movie much. I am a dyed in the wool fan of the books. To be fair, there are some things I do like in this. I think Zoe was exceptional as Trillian. I thought some of the visuals of the movie were brilliant. It is these parts, and the 20year slog, that gets me to a 4/10There were moments of greatness, and it's in that that I am most upset. The greatness shows what COULD have been. A H2G2 movie could have been brilliant, but with the changes to the source; for fans of the original, it's average.The movie I feel was tailored to a new audience. The humour feels closer to American humour than British. I'm not sure if this was intended or not. The changes where made to make it a stand alone 2hr movie with enough 'normal points' to keep non-fans happy. I don't know if it worked. I don't know if new audiences, that had never read the books (or played the game, listened to the radio, or watched the TV series), will enjoy the humour.What really worries me is that people will see the movie, think it's terrible and than write off every other format.

Having read and enjoyed the books, and owning the BBC version, I was concerned about what Hollywood would do to ""Americanize"" it.Unfortunately, I was right to be worried. If you've seen or heard any other version, then the film makes sense (mainly), however, if you haven't then you are likely to walk out the cinema with a sense of ""WTF?"" There is no explanation of why Ford is on Earth, no feeling of the sheer frustration of Arthur as many of the things that happen to him throughout other incarnations simply don't happen, and Zaphod is a pathetic ghost of the arrogant self obsessed character he should be.Instead we had a pasteurised love interest between Arthur and Trillian which doesn't work very well, a Marvin android with most of it's funny lines taken out and a script that seems to jump more than a flea with itching powder.A disappointing big screen version that could have been so much better if they had simply taken the time to explain more of the plot, and made more use of the HHG book voice-overs that are the central laughter makers of previous versions.Take time out to read the books, or watch the BBC version.

279,Rick_Terminal,"I've seen it, it's rubbish.",5,29 April 2005,"I'm going to re-write my post to be a little more helpful. I was so confused by what I had seen last night that I wasn't able to write an objective review.I always recommend that if you see an 'adapted from' film, that you read the book it came from. In this case, the film has an excellent heritage; A book, a radio series, a video game and a mini series. All of which were brilliant in my opinion.So, what have they done with the pool of imagination that was invested in this quarter century epic? They have tossed it away in an attempt to please die hard fans, newbies, and Americans. STOP! Let me explain that last comment, as it is not intended as racism  I work for an American company, and I'm pleased about it too. They are intelligent, hard working, energetic, and have a wonderful sense of humour. They don't always get irony, but let me assure you they are TIRED of being underestimated by the film industry. This is what has happened here.So, wait  it tries to please fans too? Oh yes; it tries too hard in fact. When the Earth was destroyed, the familiar theme music from the radio series (and mini series) kicked in. It almost bought a tear to my eye as it screamed ""THIS is where the story really starts"". I really hoped that they were portraying the destruction of Earth as just the starting point of an epic story. Then it all went horribly, horribly wrong.1. Allan Rickman's voice was perfectly cast  but the shell they have voiced him over does not fit. Marvin looks more like some sort of 60's radio, and struts awkwardly about the sets with no physical presence at all.2. The plot has now shifted in focus to the sentimental rebuilding of Earth and a love story between Trillian (now an American) and Arthur. It is sloppy MUSH. The point should have been ""Earth was blown up, s*** happens, the galaxy goes on""3. The pace was too fast and lacked direction. Even the whale and flowers scene was hashed through just to keep the fans happen.At this point, the film industry goes ""Ohhhh, look at what we can do with CGI! It's amazing and saved us so much cash that you should like it too!"" Well I have NEWS for you. WE DON'T LIKE IT. It looks unrealistic and detracts from believability, and that is the FIRST element you must satisfy to make a successful piece of fiction.4. The plot devices are invented for the purpose of the film  and are made up to loosely interconnect events in the book. People who have not read the book may just pass this off as 'zany for the sake of being zany'. In reality, it is just poorly written  sub plots come and go, and there are a whole host of unanswered questions at the end.Despite the above there are a couple of saving graces. I liked the various nods to the book, the game, the radio series, and the mini series. There are some pretty funny new jokes in there too (such as the infinite improbability drive's effects on the cast). Stephen Fry did an excellent job as the book  but I still prefer the original voice, sorry Fry!By the end of this film, it's as if it desperately wants to finish as the project is too big. Special effects are replaced by EXTREMELY poor sets and awful dialogue. Men in orange overalls building a planet by hand? Oh, come onI'm too depressed to keep writing  I feel as if a masterpiece has been cut up, urinated on, and passed onto a conveyor belt for consumption at a sub standard sushi restaurant. I can only pray that one day, artistic brilliance will be allowed to drive the making of future modern masterpieces  rather than lining the pockets of these greedy and soulless hacks that produce this drivel.The biggest laugh of the evening was raised when they used the word ""b*ll*cks"". That says it all, really.Rest in Peace, Douglas  I'm sorry for what they have done to your masterpiece.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
280,huladog55,Pointless,3,15 October 2005,"I suppose if you've never read any of the Hitchhiker's Guide series, you might find this movie to be 'an entertaining interstellar romp"" or some such nonsense. For the rest of us, save your time and money. I was very disappointed.This film resembled the original novel in that it includes the same characters, some settings, and a basic plot line. From there it deviates in to stupidity. I don't fault the majority of the cast cast. I lay blame squarely on the inept directing of Garth Jennings, and the embarrassing overacting of Sam Rockwell. As a director with no feature film experience, he was way out of his league. And Mr. Rockwell is not the comic 'second coming'.The entire storyline has been butchered. Changed from a fish out water tale to one of lost love. The credits list Douglas Adams as the screenwriter, but I find it hard to believe that he would have allowed some of the inconsistencies that appear in this film, or sign off on the confusion of the project.In the novel, Arthur Dent is ripped from his world into the wild and crazy outer space world of Ford Prefect. Prefect is portrayed as, well, I don't know what they were trying to do. In the novel, Prefect is a man seeking pleasure wherever it is, and avoiding work whenever possible. Rockwell's Zaphod is a jerk. In the novel, he is a wild crazy playboy adventurer. The entire storyline involving Trillian was skipped, and her character seems bored to tears. Zooey Deschanel was wasted here.I must say that I was pleased with Mos Def's performance. He did well with what he was given. You got the sense that his character was truly comfortable in the crazy world he lived in. Sam Rockwell, on the other hand, trampled his character. You have to wonder if these actors read the book at any point in the conception process. Rockwell turns a blissfully unaware, super rich playboy of a character into a mean-spirited jerk of a character who merely distracts from each scene he is in. Overacting does not substitute for character development. The twin heads SFX became tiresome after it's second appearance, ruining the duality of the Zaphod character.It's not that HHGTTG isn't nice to look at. It is. The colors are vivid, and the sets are marvelous. I'd expect nothing less from a director with music video experience. But the glitz attempts to hide the lack of substance that permeates this bore.For sure, it'd be easy to pick apart the technical differences like a Star Trek geek comparing the movies to the various series, but that's not the point. The fundamental character of the wonderful novel has been changed. The tone of the film is overwhelmingly negative, whereas the books are relatively positive works. They're fun. This was not. Not recommended.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

I never read the book, or watched the TV show, so It was my very first introduction to this particular SCI-FI franchise. The plot centers around Arthur (Martin Freeman) who has his house demolished at the start of the film, only to have the rest of his planet demolished a few minutes later. Luckily he escapes with his black friend, and their quest begins, and the plot goes to hell.I was just sitting there saying ""What is this?"".

282,Niffiwan,Hilarious!,8,19 May 2005,"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy wasn't one of my favourite books when I first read it; I was expecting an epic and instead got something a lot smaller in scale that seemed to progress randomly from event to event, letting the jokes carry the story. I remember thinking that Dauglas Adams had nothing on Terry Pratchett (creator of the Discworld book series). Since then, especially after reading the next book in the series (The Restaurant at the End of the Universe), my appreciation of HGG has grown quite a bit. The book has flaws of course, but if you just accept those as part of the creation it also has some astoundingly brilliant moments.The reason I mention this is that the same could be said of the movie. It's certainly not perfect; it reduces some of the jokes in the book to one-liners (the basement joke is particularly disappointing), there are parts where it feels as if the characters are just randomly travelling from planet to planet, and the line delivery in some sections is a bit inaudible. Nevertheless, the movie definitely brings something new to the series - visual humour. Besides the excellent flash-animated Hitchhiker's Guide entries that are littered throughout the film, there are many moments in the movie where the book's humour is conveyed perfectly without any use of words whatsoever. This definitely makes the movie a worthy addition to the series, and is definitely something that they should pursue further if they plan to make a sequel. The final 30 minutes of the film are especially awesome, and redeemed any doubts that I might've had during the middle of the movie (much as Restaurant at the End of the Universe redeemed my doubts about the HGG book).Regarding other complaints that people have raised: the romance between Trillian and Arthur IS a touch overdone, but not by a lot. I felt that this was always a part of the original book in any case; here it's simply made a little more prevalent. My only suggestion to them for the next film would be to avoid a cheap Hollywood trick that they used this time around - showing them kissing in a rotating close-up shot. The romance is fine, but it should be made a little less ""movie-like"". The other complaint was that there is a section of the story regarding Zaphod's political rival that doesn't really go anywhere. I think that this is something that was planned to be completed in the sequel (a bit like Greebo talking about Jabba's bounty on Han Solo in Star Wars: A New Hope). And I certainly hope they do make a sequel!A fabulous movie, on the whole, recommended from me! 9/10. This is one of those movies that I'd be happy to watch again (and I would too, if only theatre prices weren't so expensive)!",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
283,Tkbn3812,"On the whole a great film, well worth seeing if you've read the books",8,16 September 2016,"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is a film that compliments the book series very well. The cast is well chosen, the story is brilliant, and it's a funny film that really brings out the best of Douglas Adams' famous series. For the most part, if you've read the first book you'll be up to speed, though it's worth reading the rest. The film features Arthur Dent, whose home is demolished one terrible morning, to make way for a road bypass. Only minutes later is planet Earth destroyed, to make way for a galactic bypass. And so begins a long story of whacky space adventures that take its characters on a journey literally out of this world. There are four main characters that are the premise for this film. Zaphod Beeblebrox (Sam Rockwell) an egotistic two-headed President of the Galaxy, is on a quest to find the Ultimate Question. Ford Prefect (Mos Def), named after a car he almost got ran over by, is a friendly alien from a planet in the vicinity of Beetleguese. Tricia McMillan (Zooey Deschanel) is the love interest of the movie, a notable difference to the book that I will mention later. And of course, we cannot forget Arthur Dent (Martin Freeman), an ordinary man from England who has been thrust into the perils of his Galaxy. While Marvin (Warwick Davis), the chronically depressed robot, is quite a major character, he doesn't see that much screen time. The film paces itself really well, and I think the first scene prior to the destruction of Earth is very well made, setting the film up for a thrilling adventure. Interjections from none other than master narrator Stephen Fry help jog the story along, by adding little anecdotes of information from the novels. The cast is fairly well chosen, especially in Martin Freeman, who portrays the often-frustrated but overall-caring character of Arthur Dent so brilliantly. There doesn't seem to have been any purpose in Questular Rontok (Anna Chancellor), but each actor is almost a direct match to the characters in the novels. That is, except Trillian.Trillian is overall a fairly minor character in the novels, however it was interestingly chosen to push her more into the limelight, giving her a presence in a love triangle between Arthur and Zaphod. It was clever to do this, but fans of the series may be disappointed to see a whole new story arc introduced purely for the purposes of romance (although I wasn't). The story of the Vogans in the series feels wholly incomplete, so it seems wise that it was resolved in the movie. On the whole, the film intertwined plots from the novels ingeniously, adding what seems necessary here and there. It seems the ending on Magrathea was a little unusual, but on the whole it completes the movie decently enough. This is a film that, to use Adams' quote, has made a lot of people very angry, and even been regarded as a bad move. Perhaps these people should take into account that many of the differences between the book and movie were written in by Douglas Adams himself, prior to his death. On the whole, it's mostly harmless, and certainly worth a watch. I certainly enjoyed it; it really compliments the novels very well. Arthur Dent, and for that matter all the characters, are brilliantly acted out. The plot is to be commended for the most part, and the introduction of a romance that really supports Arthur as a character is on the whole satisfying.If you've read the series you have to watch the movie. And if you haven't, it's still definitely worth a see.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
284,Skullbussa,Incompetent film for Trekkie-like Adams worshipers only,3,2 May 2005,"To be perfectly blunt this is the worst movie I have seen in the theater in a few years.There is a bit of nostalgia summoned by this film. Remember all those awful low-budget science fiction films of the 1980's that tried so hard to either emulate or parody Star Wars and it's huge success? This film fits right into that group.Yes, I am aware the book was a huge success and Adams had a loyal following. Yes, I am aware the material has a very unique sense of humor that may be lost on some people. No, I did not expect a science-fiction-action-extravaganza...I just expected good-humored science fiction.Well, I didn't get it. None of the actors were able to reach any sort of rhythm with their line delivery. This is punctuated by abysmal editing that jaunts and juts and absolutely keeps the audience confused as to where the character dialog is going. In comedy, timing is everything, and Hitchhiker's timing is completely off. It's like watching a string of Monty Python skits backwards. Jokes are set up and dropped like cluster bombs all over the place, none hitting their mark. Rickman and Deschanel are completely wasted. Sam Rockwell is trying too hard to be Owen Wilson. And Martin Freeman (whoever the hell that is) is so painfully awful as Arthur Dent that I had to wince every time he spoke. He reminds me of my 5th grade Math teacher when he tried to entertain us with jokes.Chances are...if you have NOT read the books you will NOT like this movie.

Given the tendency for movies to screw up books' stories, I was even more worried - so I spent a lot of effort following its progress and trying to convince myself it could be pretty good. Then I read the early reviews on IMDb and told myself that while some people said it wasn't so good, a lot of others thought it was well worth it.And then it came to that fateful night when my girlfriend's sister called and asked us which movie we'd like to see together... and I suggested Hitchhiker's - but they could watch anything else if they wanted.Hitchhiker's it was...Oh dear oh dear oh dear. They're still mocking me for it. To put it bluntly, it's bad. Very bad. Under the circumstances of that evening, it was personally-embarrassing bad.It's taken a month for me to get up the courage to write this, but here's what I can remember...It opens with a musical number which seems totally out of place (and isn't very good).It has no flow whatsoever, either in terms of story or editing. Things happen, you don't know why. Suddenly something else happens, but you don't know why. I was either lucky or cursed to know what should have been explained the whole time... goodness knows what the girls made of it.The dialogue is terrible - either the result of poor acting, poor screenplay or poor editing. I don't know which, but I do know that there was a lot of incoherent mumbling or shouting throughout.The characters had no character. I loved each and every one of them from the radio series' and books, but here they are flat, boring and sometimes just annoying (Trillian and Zaphod). Marvin (""he was cute"" said the future sister in law!) had a tiny spark of the original, but only has about five lines in the whole movie. Strange, I used to think he was the most outstanding character in the entire oeuvre!.On a plus point, the visual effects were nice - although I have to say I liked the book sequences in the TV series a lot more.(Minor spoiler in this paragraph.) The messing with the story didn't improve things at all. The missing bits left gaping holes and the re-writing turned it all into a Hollywood ""running from the bad guys"" cliché... which it never was!!! The added bits were pointless and not very funny. Which brings us to the real problem...This film is not funny. Where before there was great wit, there is now tame slapstick (you've watched the ""funniest"" bits already if you've seen the trailer!). What were once huge, convoluted, intelligent jokes are now rushed, throwaway links to the next scene. The weird little twists and concepts that put a smile on your face seem to have taken the day off. Most of the punchlines and proper delivery seemed to be missing. It makes you wonder if the makers actually understood the humour in the first place!.And quirky humour was basically the point of Hitchhiker's, was it not?",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

These didn't bother me too much, as they were, for the most part, very similar in feel to the books. While seeing the movie I thought they had included a lot from the other books in the trilogy, but when I got home I re-read the book and found that wasn't the case. I think what disappointed me were the many hilarious lines in the book that got left out of the movie, for no apparent reason.

He actually moved from England to LA just to make sure this movie was done right.If he hadn't died when the movie was being filmed, the original author of the book(s) would have had pretty decent control over the movie from start to finish.It is perhaps a sign of the times that most of my review of this movie is fending off internet trolls. But this is surrealist sci-fi comedy. If you think that sounds like something you would love, this movie is probably for you.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
290,grandfunkfan,"Good movie, but the book is better.",7,22 May 2005,"This is a good movie, but I prefer the book. As with any genre of fiction, I can generally create more vivid scenes in my mind than the best special effects can. I do like the way they handled the two-headed detail, and the alien creatures were as realistic as any aliens I've ever seen. I thought the actors and special effects were all excellent. Movies cannot include every little detail from the books that might stand out to a few readers, such as the importance of the towel. However, when taken simply as an outing for a couple of hours of entertainment, I thought they did a great job of transferring the book to a movie. My wife has never read the book, yet she enjoyed the movie. I hope to see some sequels.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
291,Phrankster163,Really good adaptation,9,27 September 2005,"I'm a big fan of the books. In fact i've read them in both danish and English several times, and so this was a movie that i had been looking forward to for a long time (and to be honest didn't believe would ever be made), so even though the expectations were high, i did all i could to tone them down. Thankfully i was not disappointed in any way. Mainly because it follows the book so well, although some of the funniest bits are cut out, because they don't play any part in plot, but hey for me to be totally satisfied it would have to be at least a six hour movie. But anyway, the cast is really good, and there are a few fun surprises in that area and some of the stuff that you thought would be really hard to do effectively on screen (Zaphod and his two heads, for example) all work out really well. Hope they do the rest of the books too.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
292,guillermotorofan,He's got a towel!RUN!,10,29 May 2005,"Alas I have now seen The Hitchhikers Guide To The Galaxy 3 times now, twice in theaters and once on DVD. And it has lost none of it's magic. We start by humming along to a charming and fun song sang by a chorus of dolphins (So long and thanks for all the fish). And thus we go from dolphin to an ape descendant Arthur Dent,who's having a rough day. We find he spent his previous night having a great time with an utterly amazing woman at a fancy dress party, though things got ugly once he refused her offer to travel to Madagascar with her. Things only get worse when a mysterious man interrupts the two and Trisha goes with the man,who seems ready for the excitement that Arthur is not ready for. (Wanna see my spaceship?). And thus we find that two of Arthurs homes are set up for demolition. His house and his planet! Both for bypasses (Hyperspace and non-hyperspace). His good friend Ford Prefect comes along and saves Arthurs life, repaying the favor(Dent saved Ford from being hit by a car.The odd thing is Ford is trying to introduce himself to a speeding car). And alas the two end up taking an adventure across the galaxy, with the homeless arthur dent,Ford Prefect,Zaphod Beeblebrox(the man which Trisha went away with),and Trisha Macmillian the girl from the party!This film is absolutely hilarious, and never loses it's humor. The film also has several very beautiful messages put throughout the film,and unlike many films it doesn't blast you with morals.This film Slips the moral of the story in quietly. It has a love story I find more believable than Ti-bloody-tanic. It has several moments that are also very moving. It gives a few details here and there that eventually form a plot that keeps you guessing (unless you've read the book or seen the incoherent television series). This film is something the televiosion series was not. Well-written. This has a very good and coherent plot,a vast advancement from the TV series). It gives many props to the fans (such as I) with several cameos from the original Arthur Dent, the original Marvin, and theme song. Everybody in the film is perfectly cast, though Mos Def and Sam Rockwell take the show. In short SEE IT!",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
293,ambrose,Why would anybody make this ... except for money(???),1,25 May 2005,"This was a huge disappointment. As a long-time fan of Adams and of the BBC radio and the television version, I was crushed. I actually fell asleep! I watched it again afterwards, still shocked.The acting was insipid and unbelievable (and that in an epic space fantasy!). Zaphod was way overplayed and unbelievable and the two heads and three arms were just plain wrong. One head could not talk to the other! Who is Ford? Why is he named Ford? Why is he black? Why does he run to Arthur's house with a grocery cart full of beer and peanuts? There is so little motivation in this film for anything! Why is there an entire construction company and 25 men? It was just a little house. Besides, they cut out the dialogue about finding the plans, the basement, the disused lavatory, and the leopard. So, why bother with all the props? Marvin is short and moves quickly and often. This is not in keeping with the character! The great Warwick Davis deserves better.What a waste of the adorable Zooey! She wants to go to with Arthur? Why? And why would she desire him anyway? BTW, they met at a 'fancy dress' ball. This, uh, doesn't mean weird costumes. Huge mistake #1. Love story where there was none.Characters drift in and out of continuity. The letter ""Z"" is pronounced ZEE by Tricia but ZED by everyone else. The planet Magrathea is pronounced variously as magra-THAY-uh and magra-THEE-uh. The excellent narrator does his best to hold things together, but he's no Peter Jones alas, and he's not given the chance actually. The name of the film **IS** the name of the book but the part of the book is hugely reduced.What's this 'dolphins with musical bit' for the beginning? Of course, *I* knew what it was (stupid and wasteful), but did most of the audience? That's not the beginning anyway. These folks should've followed Douglas Adams -- who wrote the story for radio. They were not ""treating"" a book here! They were working with output from a man who had a tremendous, albeit unusual, understanding of how to tell a story -- the sequences being especially important to his style. And this story is nothing if not style.The end seemed to tease us about the restaurant at the end of the universe and then confuse us about at which end it was located. Good grief! It's the end of the universe in time, not location. This huge gaffe #2 is enough for me to hope that these same folks do not get a chance to make a sequel.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
294,rleather,Just not possible,4,6 June 2005,"There are millions of comments going into this film and I can see why opinion is split.Some people grew up with the long running and chaotic radio play. Some people remember the original BBC Radio series and others remember the books best of all.But I can imagine this film only appealing to new fans of Adam's work because a whole set of preconceived ideas of character and plot have been established which are only broken and confused by this film.The fact is that two hours is simply not enough time to squeeze in either a six part mini-series or a umpteen part radio play. But it would have been unacceptable to film produces to create a half finished plot. It's simply catch 22 and I have a lot of sympathy of the production staff in trying to do it.What might have been better would have been to start as Hitchhikers does and then go onto a completely different tack. But without the writing talents of Douglas Adams, that would have been impossible.So where does that leave us?Is it a truly terrible film? No, not in the slightest. Is it a complete lash-up of the original? Absolutely.Personally, I blame the mice.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
295,atlant,"Good grief, what a disappointment!",1,18 September 2005,"If you're a fan of either the books or the original BBC TV series, then there's nearly an infinite probability that you'll want to give this movie a pass and it's almost infinitely improbable that it could have been any more awful than it already is.The trivia describes it as not being a literal adaptation of the books. Well, they sure got that right. Even the parts that are trying to be a literal adaptation of the book are atrocious, shortened to the point where the gags are simply lost, and the new material that was written simply doesn't fit and isn't entertaining.Sam Rockwell as George W. Beeblebrox spends the whole movie perfecting the art of being annoying. Ford Prefect doesn't appear to have anything to do or anything to say; perhaps next time he should try reciting the Vogon poetry. Arthur Dent and Trillian are at least mildly entertaining.Siriusly, get the BBC TV series; it's available on DVD and far, far more entertaining; this version of the movie is complete and total dog!",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
296,gatsby06,To be continued,3,24 June 2007,"I see some honesty is beginning to surface on this movie, so I will just say at this point that I think the only explanation for this movie being so horrendous is that the director deliberately sabotaged it. Nobody could ruin such good material by accident.He turned all of the characters on their heads, or at least on their faces. It's as though he got tired of people trying to explain the book to him, saying ""don't you get it?"" and decided he was the director, and he could do whatever he wanted. Nothing, absolutely nothing in this movie corresponds to the original concept and spirit. It is a total travesty.----I've seen, heard, read them all. But I never thought a version of ""Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"" would put me to sleep.The best part is Alan Rickman as the voice of Marvin, although there could have been more of Rickman's trademark sarcastic bite. It's as though the director was holding back the actors.The worst part, by far, is playing Zaphod Beeblebrox as a redneck rock star. Beeblebrox, the delinquent but ultra-cool intergalactic president, with a Southern accent? Are you mad? I won't blame the actor for this, (Sam Rockwell clearly can act, given his completely different performance in Galaxy Quest) as I am not sure the director read the book. There seems to be no understanding of any of the character of characters by the director. None.Each version of the HHGG trilogy has been slightly different, but each has contained the key verbiage essential to the message of political and social satire. Until this one.This version appears to be a sort of adolescent Star Wars, with good guys and bad guys -- or good bad guys vs bad good guys -- chasing each other through space and hyperspace. Sorry, that's not what HHGG is about.This seems to be one of those Hollywood conceits where somebody gets a contract, reads a few pages of the book, decides it is too much work, and writes the screenplay pretty much from scratch. It seems they didn't even make it far enough in to realize Trillian is an astrophysicist on the dole. Nope, all she is is a pretty girl at a party who got picked up by an alien. Talk about earth girls being easy!Now I know Douglas Adams contributed some of the changes. But the ones who actually made this movie seem to know little about the book aside from a sort of Cliff's Notes of the plot. (Have they Cliff Noted HHGG for college classes yet?) I will have to finish this review, and the movie, after I take a nap.In the meantime, I suggest you read the books; I promise you they will not put you to sleep, provided you aren't brain dead. Or see the BBC television production. Or listen to the radio series. Or listen to the book read aloud on books on tape, or whatever it is they did that time. Then you will understand what this masterpiece was about.* I want to tear this movie to shreds, but so far have restrained myself. The directing was an abomination, an insult, a travesty of an insult of an abomination. Advice: Do Not Watch It!",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
297,timsmith37,Mostly disappointing,5,16 May 2005,"A project drawing upon such familiar and much beloved material was always going to stand or fall on the delivery of the lines, and therefore the casting. Stephen Fry (a close personal friend of Douglas Adams) is a very acceptable Book, and the suitably improbably monikered Zooey Deschanel makes a fetching Trillian. Mos Def however is a bland Ford: there is no sense of assumed cool masking near panic. And Sam Rockwell gets Zaphod all wrong: a narcissistic pin-up with a crazed alter ego, when what he should be aiming at is Nathan Barley to the power of infinity. The second head is real cop out as well.Bill Nighy as Slartibartfast is another disappointment; on paper he must have seemed perfect, but it does not come off. He works so hard on being diffident and dithery, that he fails to nail down his punchlines. The likable Martin Freeman is also miscast as Arthur: Arthur is not likable, he is English. Faced with the destruction of his planet and immensity of the cosmos, his response is petulance and peevishness. Freemen misses this: you never feel that his Arther really NEEDS a cup of tea. He plays Arthur instead as a sensitive, modest, genuinely self-effacing sort of chap; Arthur is not self-effacing - any show of modesty is English understatement, and intended by him to be understood as such. One of the funniest lines in the book is when Zaphod congratulates Arthur on saving all their lives, ""Oh, it was nothing"", says Arthur. His chagrin when Zaphod takes him at his word is glorious. The exchange, needless, to say is missing from the film. Doubtless the makeover of Arthur's character is deliberate; the film makers apparently feeling the need to give audiences a lead they could identify with, in an aspirational sort of way. Personally I always identified with the old Arthur, in a distinctly non-aspirational sort of way, and to be honest I kind of thought that that was the point. Satire is not supposed to be feelgood.In similar vein, a gooey romance between Arthur and Trillian is thrown into the mix; worse it is implied that Zaphod is jealous, which is all wrong. An ego as monstrous as Zaphod should not be jealous of, of all people, Arthur. In the books Zaphod barely acknowledges Arthur as a sentient lifeform.The film makers would doubtless defend themselves, arguing that the Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy has continued to evolve through all its versions. This is true, but only up to a point; the changes have been structual, not wholesale reimaginings. Other changes are less grating. John Malkovich makes a special effects heavy appearance as Zaphod's presidential rival, Humma Kavula; and there is a detour to the Kafkaesque planet Vogsphere. Accommodating these subplots does however mean that much original dialogue has to be sacrificed, whilst the storyline becomes even more rushed and lacking in proper resolution. The new material is not always as strong as the original, but it does at least have the virtue of being fresh; which is preferable to waiting for favourite lines, only to cringe as they are mangled.Enough of the true Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy spirit remains to ensure that if you are coming to the film fresh there will be something to enjoy, but you would be better off seeking out the books or the original radio version (or dare I say it, the BBC television adaptation, cheesy special effects and all).",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

The movie is shorter and different but does not vary from the previous experiences too much. It is enjoyable, the music is fine, acting is fun, story is baloney but you do find out the real meaning of life and how important we are in the universe. See it if you are playful and don't go if you are serious. Remember Helen Miren, Alan Rickman, and John Makovitch are in it but you won't see them. For a family outing on a hot afternoon this is fine fare. Come to think of it, there are no forbidden language in it. The cast is not very familiar to me but are completely capable.

300,jiujitsu_jesus,Mr. Adams would have been proud,8,1 May 2005,"Are you looking for a comedy that combines light-hearted and exuberant humour with a cerebral and incisively entertaining script? Many Hollywood scriptwriters and directors are, and their recent efforts at producing such a film have been a mixed bag, ranging from the original but esoteric WHAT THE BLEEP DO WE KNOW?! to the laboured and poorly-executed Christmas WITH THE KRANKS. Debut director Garth Jennings has finally, I believe, hit the spot with his adaption of Douglas Adams' humorous science fiction novel, THE HITCHHIKER'S GUIDE TO THE GALAXY. This is a highly entertaining and near-flawlessly presented film. It is not without its quirks and oddities, which, depending on the nature of your sense of humour, may depreciate its quality immensely; if you simply take it at face value and try to enjoy yourself, however, this movie shouldn't disappoint.The printed HITCHHIKER'S GUIDE TO THE GALAXY is, in fact, a quartet of novels - or, as Douglas Adams expressed it, ""a trilogy in four parts"". This latter description aptly epitomises the structure of these books - humorous in a random and quirky fashion, and not possessed of any particular structure. In order to avoid having the plot pitch into a confused mess, the film's script has a more clearly defined destination. It begins in a similar fashion - Arthur Dent (Martin Freeman), a young Englishman is narrowly saved from the destruction of planet Earth by his eccentric friend, Ford Prefect (Mos Def), who turns out to be from a planet in the vicinity of Betelgeuse, and not from Guildford after all. Hitching a ride with the fugitive president of the galaxy,Zaphod Beeblebrox (Sam Rockwell), who comes through as a younger, more benign Ronald Reagan, they find themselves on a mission to rescue the only other surviving Earthling in the galaxy (Zooey Deschanel) from the clutches of the bureaucratic Vogons. The laughs come thick and fast, and the pace is consistently rollicking. All this is presented on gorgeous, CGI-enhanced sets, with a wonderful effort from Jim Henson's workshop in the alien-puppets-and-costumes department.While I found this to be side-splittingly hilarious, there are quite a number of people who have no patience for wacky humour, and who might perceive this as giddy drivel. This is quite understandable - THE HITCHHIKER'S GUIDE TO THE GALAXY isn't going to be everyone's cup of tea, and if you didn't like ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE SPOTLESS MIND, you might hate this. Beyond that, the film has few flaws overall, except Zaphod's double-headed stunt, which thankfully ceases fairly early on.The cast are a coherent ensemble of intelligent, talented actors with a lot of personality, and not only are they excellent as individuals, but display tremendous energy and coherency as a cast. Martin Freeman IS Arthur Dent - he is convincing and dryly funny as always. Mos Def was an unusual choice as Ford (and I've seen him cop a lot of racist flack over this, even on IMDb), but he proves to be the right man for the job in a scene-stealing and thoroughly memorable performance. Sam Rockwell performs well as Zaphod, even if his comic stupidity becomes a little irksome after a while; Zooey Deschanel is a likable character and an interesting and endearing love interest; and Bill Nighy, Stephen Fry and Alan Rickman provide solid background performances, particularly Rickman, who has perhaps the most consistently amusing script in the entire film.Don't expect miracles from HITCHHIKER'S GUIDE TO THE GALAXY - it is supremely unpredictable, and may not turn out to be the right comedy for you. In the event that it is, however, it's definitely worth a look. 8/10.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
301,richardjp-17225,Not what I'd hoped,5,21 March 2018,"I came out of the movie theatre feeling unsatisfied with this movie. Being a big fan of the book and the TV series, I had certain expectations. Some of these expectations were met, some weren't. The characters were mainly very good - Arthur Dent, Trillion, Slartibartfast, Zaphod Beeblebrox. In fact Beeblebrox was very cool, but unfortunately they ruined is character later in the movie when something happened to him and he ended up in a drunken state for most of the movie after. Ford Prefect was not as likeable and Marvin the Paranoid Andriod was not good at all. I just didn't like the character like I did in the book and TV series.The movie did have some good moments - like a Magrathean painting Ayers Rock red. Most of the trade mark jokes were there too, but there were also new scenes not from the book, which I had my doubts about - like a visit to the Vogon home planet to rescue Trillion from the Vogons. The movie felt very rushed at times, which is probably understandable as they had to condense a lot of material into an hour and a half. So scenes that progressed at a leisurely pace in the TV series whizzed through very quickly, which unfortunately took away a lot of the humour from them.The orginal actor who plays Arthur Dent makes a cameo and so does the original robot for Marvin (All though his is a non-speaking cameo).",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
302,romper-2,3rd worst in the universe,5,4 May 2005,"It's bad when you feel you could walk out of a movie when the opening credits are playing. Even worse when you have to sit through trailers for some crappy movies that make you feel like asking for a refund on the last three minutes of your life.British comedy shows re-done by Americans are, of course, the third worst in the universe. The second worst are those of British comedy shows turned into American movies. To survive those you have to remember that Hollywood has no sense of humour and that you're lucky for small mercies when any trace of the original brilliance survives at all. The absolutely worst shows of all are done by Americans who feel that they have to replace brilliant comedy with a love story and a big-screen kiss.Having got that out of my system, there were some cute things. Mos Def as Ford Prefect showed us why the towel is so important; Martin Freeman is a good Arthur; and the Improbability Drive effects were very cute and funny. Some of the Vogon scenes were good, and others were just humdrum. I found that the contractions of the wordy wittiness from Douglas Adam's book appalled me, but I recognise that it's hard to make that work on screen.I don't know how much the script and production changed after Adam's death, but I think he would have been slightly embarrassed at the end result.One final thing - what size was Marvin meant to be? When we first met him, it appeared that his size changed between shots. Sometimes he appeared to be about 1 metre tall, and then he looked almost 2 metres tall. Strange... He certainly didn't have the same (lack of) charm as the Marvin from the TV series for me.Overall, pass marks. I would not recommend this movie to any committed fan of previous incarnations of Hitchhikers, but it's good to finally see Adam's work on the big screen.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
303,AlrightGuy,"On a scale of 1 to 10...this movie is a ""Q""",9,3 May 2005,"Very good movie, but I can see how a lot of people might hate it. People who adore the books might hate it for straying from familiar ground. People who have never read the books might be confused. People who are slow on the uptake and have trouble getting British humor (or 'humour') might want to stay home entirely, or at least bring a roll of duct tape to the theater to prevent their heads from exploding. Every performance was dead on, especially the wonderful Mos Def. A surprisingly perfect choice for Ford Prefect. And you thought rappers couldn't act... The things that were added or changed were for the most part good choices, although *possible spoiler*the quest for the weapon felt a little awkward. It seems like it was only put in to give them an out at the end, almost a deus ex machina. Why would Humma Kavula want this weapon? What was he planning to do with it, convince the voters they had made the wrong choice? Plus, the gag has already been done somewhat with the Blamethrower in Mystery Men.Anyway, the opening song was catchy enough to get me humming it on the way to my car. The cameos and little things I am now reading about are enough to make me want to see it again (a DVD rental though). And the moment when Arthur and Slartibartfast enter the product floor was staggering.

304,Nephalim,>Insert Appropriate HHG Quote Here<,3,29 April 2005,"It's strange. Like, apparently, every other reviewer I've read here, I read the Hitch-Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy (and the rest) and they're probably among the most pivotal books I've ever read. So I'm familiar with them, and I couldn't say I was going into the movie with much confidence in Hollywood's abilities to safeguard something so precious to me.And I was right. This is barely the Hitch-Hiker's Guide. I've always been of the mind that a movie adaptation of the Guide would never work - there are elements to the book that simply defy a visual medium, and I never saw the point in making a movie out of it, other than simply for the sake of it. That we measure the success of literature these days in how good the movie adaptations are perplexes me.The characters here are the characters in name only, and it's the fault of direction and writing, not the actors. I agree with the common sentiment that these two new characters were added for the sake of it, because they served little purpose otherwise. The film derails itself into sci/fi tropes, forgetting, apparently, how much fun Douglas Adams had mocking them. But that was expected. Could you have made a more faithful screen adaptation while recognizing the limits of the medium? Absolutely. But it would've sacrificed spectacle and clichés.Perhaps the most amazing thing about this movie is the trailer. Looking back on it, the trailer (which took the stance of being the Guide's definition of a movie trailer) was tearing strips out of the very movie it sought to promote. The trailer had more Douglas Adams in it than the movie.I'm honestly amazed how well this movie is being received. This wasn't remarkably bad, nor was it spectacular. It was fluff - a pointless, contented time-waster. I'll watch it again, I'm sure, but I won't go out of my way to do it. But while it may not have failed as a Hollywood film, it did fail as a tribute to Douglas Adams, and I'm quite surprised that there are so many who think otherwise.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
305,daveboo,Bit let down,6,23 May 2005,I have never read the books so In no way have I been let down in that respect. The problem with Hitchhikers guide to the galaxy is that it got me gripped straight away and then got worse as the story progressed and ultimately made me fell a bit let me down by it.I thought the film started excellent and was really enjoying it until Arthur (the person from the office) ends up on Zaphod ship. His character started to annoy me abit and I didn't find zaphod funny (sorry).I will probably watch this film again and would recommend you try it out but be warned it does feel quite thrown together and could have been so much better.,The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
306,JimShine,they seem to know where their towels are,8,22 May 2005,"Well, it could have been a disaster, and a few minutes in I hadn't made my mind up. The opening sequence is a joy and raised hopes very high indeed. Then hopes were kicked vigorously by the brevity of the bulldozer scene (what happened to ""Beware of the Leopard""?!), and Mos Def didn't seem very comfortable, or I wasn't comfortable with him. Where was the Hitchhikers I loved? But every so often something unexpected would happen. Or something very funny. Or both. I realized what it was that was ""wrong"": it wasn't the Hitchhikers I loved, but it wasn't actually trying to be. It was trying to be a different Hitchhikers to love. So we don't get the narration about the Vogon ships hanging in the sky just like bricks don't, but we do get the hilarious pull-back shot that's not only funny but actually rather clever and inventive. Basically the plot is more or less the same but most of the actual words are gone. A sensible decision, I think: the original radio show was words words words, and the book (obviously) and TV series had the space and time to preserve that. Instead the movie goes for visual humor or comic ideas rather than actual paragraphs. You do miss some things, like the full story of the Babel fish, and the long buildup to Deep Thought's answer. But you get John Malkovich's glasses and lots more (excellently done) Vogons instead, plus good use of towel by Ford. Much to my surprise, the romance angle actually worked, too. In terms of ""should you see this movie if you love the originals?"" I would say definitely yes; I think the movie has an Adams vibe throughout (not just the reference to Madagascar) so that when the dedication comes up at the end you realize how much you still miss him. The clincher is the ""factory floor"" on Magrathea: absolutely awesome, and Martin Freeman's response to it is wonderful. Should you see it if you're not familiar with the originals? You might be left at sea in places, but then at least you'll have Zaphod for company (Sam Rockwell is great; he plays the role as a cross between Tom Cruise and Dubya Bush). The group of girls behind me, who I don't think had even heard of the originals, really enjoyed it. They even got upset when... well, I can't tell you that bit.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

I found the plot advanced at a perfectly acceptable speed, there were few totally screwball cuts from one scene to another - and any were in tune with the book and film plot anyway!

Arthur Dent (Arthur Freeman) could have looked a bit more like he'd been ripped out of bed (the bathrobe looked to new), Ford Prefect (Mod Def) was probably the best portrayed, Trillian (Zooey Deschanel) looked like she was trying to be vapid, but failed (Kathryb Hahn from Crossing Jordan would have had that part nailed) and Sam Rockwell... It came as a surprise to me to read that Sam Rockwell was inspired to imitate the President of the US for his character was a bit interesting - the whole time I was watching him, I thought he was imitating Owen Wilson!But, despite the minor character flaws of the actors, they were all working with a good script, good fx and the entire ensemble, both on screen and off, did a superb job of bringing Hitchikers Guide to the Galaxy to the big screen!

308,manwithaplan42,"Not Hitchhiker's, but close.",6,20 April 2006,"People criticise this movie as being a bad adaptation of The Guide. It is not a bad adaptation of the guide, nor is it good. Well, its just this film you know. Let me put it like this, if it hadn't had thirty or so years of Hitchhiker's preceding it, if this movie was in fact the only Hitchhikers ever (no books, no radio series, no bath towel) then people would be raving about it! But because it does have all that mythos behind it, people start to compare it with the radio series, the book, not necessarily the bath towel. And lets face it, compared with the other incantations of this legendary series, it positively pales in comparison. This really is one of those films that appeals to one group of people but not another, and its not because of the cast, Martin Freeman IS Arthur Dent, Sam Rockwell is hilarious as Zaphod, Zooey Deschanel makes a very sweet and charming Trillian, the only one who is mis cast is Mos Def as Ford Prefect, not because he's black, but because he's not a very good actor. There are times where he IS Ford Prefect, and times when he just isn't...good at all. People who know all about The Guide, have heard the radio show, read the book and occasionally dried themselves with the bath towel will not like it, as the film is nothing new (granted, the plot is a little different), the first half hour of the film is a multi million dollar budget re-rerun of the old series. However, for people with no background hitchhikers experience, go and see it, it is a good movie, the only reason few people like it is because it is not the same as what has gone before it.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

I'm not complaining though, it is very funny (and a heck of a lot better than those Scary Movies!). Well, actually, I do have a couple complaints: their spaceship looked pretty stupid and the aliens were some of the fakest I have ever seen. But the plot is pretty good, and the characters were pretty funny, especially Zaphod. It's actually quite ironic once you think about it, I mean, everyone has bad days. For Arthur Dent, this is probably the worst. He finds out that his friend is an alien, his home planet gets blown up, he winds up traveling through space with some strange characters, and he never gets his tea! I have not read the book, but this movie was so good, I suspect the book wasn't anything less. However wrote it must have had a pretty wild imagination. I enjoyed the movie a lot.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
310,nilshenry,Like giving Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet a happy ending,3,21 December 2005,"It is OK to change the story when making a movie out of a book. I think it is called ""poetic licence"". The main idea is that a good story in a book often won't be as good in a movie. It will e.g. not be a good idea to narrate everything a character thinks, because else the movie will be too slow.What is not OK is to change the ""soul"" of the characters. In Douglas Adams's The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy the main character Arthur Dent is portrayed as an unlucky guy who is not too bright, and who is also unlucky in love. He will probably always be unlucky in love. This is elegantly metaphored with his wearing his pajamas and bathrobe throughout the entire book, because that was what he of course was wearing right before Earth was destroyed. Arthur Dent's luck is almost an entire story in itself and you can see a glint of determinism in the way his luck will never change.The movie has almost completely destroyed this view of Arthur Dent by making him a winner. This is disrespectful to the author and has nothing to do with poetic licence. It is not difficult to see that the director's goal has been to please the crowds and make the movie sell as well as possible.This change is about like giving Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet a Happy Ending, or making Dracula in Bram Stoker's novel realize that killing people is wrong. Maybe that could be the next project for Hollywood?",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
311,shervinv,Sam Rockwell made this film,7,13 May 2005,"I used to be a big fan of the books, I think overall if you have no familiarity with the history of the Hitchhiker, you may find this film very odd. Of course it's a British based film, with British sense of humor, and smaller than life heroes. Not what your typical Hollywood trained viewer may appreciate. But for us Hitchhikers with the twisted sense of humor, I think we'll mostly love this film. It was very funny, with Sam Rockwell easily standing head over heels over everyone else in this film. His ""George Bush"" inspired president of the Galaxy was just brilliant. I went to this film first week it opened, and got an extra chuckle out of the few folks showing up in their bathrobes. Nothing like a good cult following I say.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
312,ZachsMind,This movie is a film,1,29 April 2005,"Without question, one can refer to Douglas Adams' Hitch-Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy as a film. It is a film that can also be called a movie, and a movie that can be called a film. Of all the films in the history of film-making, this film certainly is one.Die-hard fans of the previous incarnations will no doubt appreciate that many of their favorite bits are included, albeit in abbreviated form. New fans to Douglas Adams will probably not get too lost. This film contains a well structured, if predictably melodramatic plot. The acting is superb. The effects extraordinary. The casting is gifted. The production quality unparalleled to any previous incarnation of the series.It's funny. It's pretty. It's an entertaining way to waste an hour and a half or so. After the concept of h2g2 was filtered through Hollywood's gauntlet of requirements for Hollywood films, Douglas Adams' Hitch-Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy manages to actually make some resemblance of sense. This is unfortunate, because what made all the previous incarnations work so well was the very fact they didn't make sense. They were just silly fun. One should not expect this version of the story to be identical to previous versions. One should expect nothing in particular when seeing a new version of this story, but one should expect it to be wacky goofy fun, and for all the wackiness in this version, it just feels too ...pretty. In some ways it's almost perfect. Flawless. Most everything gets tied up in a nice little bow at the end and most if not all previous incarnations never really had an ending. This one has a Hollywood sensibility, which is completely insensible when presenting something so deliciously and irreverently insensible.It's a very okay film, which is what sadly makes it so terrible.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
313,boomcoach,"Solid, but unsatisfying",6,3 May 2005,"To preface, I have read the books and seen the BBC series, but am not a hardcore fan by any means. Until I reread the book, after watching the film, I couldn't have said what followed the book and what didn't.The movie was very well cast. Mos Def and Martin Freeman were good; Sam Rockwell, as Zaphod, was excellent; and Zooey Deschanel was very good (and very sexy, in a believable way).I thought the movie worked well through the first hour, but then started to bog down. The Vogons were not funny enough to keep in the movie as long as they did. The entire detour for the encounter with Malkovich's character was pointless and distracting, and broke up an inherently bizarre plot into further fragments, all for some cool effects with the little feet (which reminded me more of Pratchett than Adams).The ending was abrupt and unsatisfying. In all, I enjoyed it and didn't mind the six bucks for the matinée, but am in no hurry to see this again.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
314,ghayes-2,"Lacks the ""Poetic Vision"" of the TV series",4,2 May 2005,"I won't argue the point of whether ""hardcore fans"" will love/hate this film versions. I can only say that, having watched the TV adaptation first, and later having read the books with great glee, I was disappointed in what was for me a lackluster filming with dis-spirited acting. (Having never heard the radio version, I cannot comment there.)A few comparisons come to me right off. The TV version caught me early on with the earnestness the actors gave to phrases such as ""What would you say if I was to tell you..."" or, ""This must be Thursday. I never could..."". The book caught me with Adams' visualizations such as the Vogon constructor ships hanging in the air ""in precisely the fashion that bricks don't."" The stars of this film throw lines like that away without any real care, and the readings from the book are too few and far between to much carry the load.The revisions to the story did not much trouble me. It's obvious that a story told in books, radio, TV and movies cannot carry exactly the same elements and still make sense. The only revision that did bother me was the way they changed the Trillian/Artthur relationship, but that only because it was weakly written and even more weakly acted.Character by character: TV-Arthur was hilariously befuddled and wallowing out of his depth from crisis to crisis. Movie-Arthur seemed merely grouchy and put-upon.TV-Ford came across as a traveler convinced of his own sophistication and trying to bring along his ape friend. Movie-Ford just didn't seem to be there most of the time.TV-Trillian was slightly ditsy but ultimately a powerful brain. Movie-Trillian never convinced me she would have ACTUALLY run off to the other side of the Earth, let alone off-world with...TV-Zaphod got several million points for cool, without ever really being mean-spirited. Movie-Zaphod just comes off as a brainless jerk.The new character played by John Malcovitch (the name eludes me at the moment) has no TV counterpart. But JM plays him with all the comic genius of Cyrus The Virus. The bit with the glasses COULD have been funny if it was just done in passing. Instead, it was handled with all the ""now watch this carefully"" subtlety of a 10 year old with a new magic set.Movie-Marvin was OK - great voice casting. Unfortunately, they didn't give him *enough* dialog, and the physical design makes it difficult to emphasize his dejected slump. It looks more as if the size of the headpiece is tipping the actor over than that the Android is having trouble coping with ""life"".The Vogons - THE HIGHLIGHT OF THE FILM! Not only were the Vogons technically more advanced than in the TV version (the passage of time and application of technology could hardly do less), they get much better dialog and a lot more screen time. They are the *only* characters in the film that REALLY carry forward Adams ""theatre of the absurd"" touch. (""He's got a TOWEL!"")Overall, the film was competent and not BAD - it just lacked the ""spark"" for which I would have hoped. Perhaps those who worked on the film can be convinced to take the first spaceship to the new world, so that they can set up the hair-salons, create the marketing plans and sanitize the phones before the rest of us get there.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
315,wilywilliam,This is quite a good movie,6,6 May 2005,"I notice that the people who hate this film are the ""die-hard"" fans of the book/radio show/TV series. Listen, this isn't the book/radio show/TV series; it is a relatively good standalone movie. Okay, so it isn't perfect. There is a lack of explanation regarding some of the 'inside' jokes, and it does edge towards Hollywood a little too much (love interest followed by rescue attempt followed by shoot out etc). But come on, it's funny, lighthearted and visually great. And it hangs together quite well, no matter what the die-hards tell you. If you go into the cinema hoping to see an jumped-up repeat, then you won't get it, and all the better in my opinion.

317,nieltje,don't panic and hitch a ride!,10,1 August 2005,"After reading the book ""The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy"" I borrowed from a friend last December, I was curious if anyone would consider to make it into a movie. I got lucky, because as soon as I logged in on IMDb I found out they were already making it! So now I had to test my patience..Waiting from January to July (I live in the Netherlands and saw the sneak preview, officially it comes out in 3 days), and finally I got to see it.I loved it. but I couldn't tell why? It's almost as impossible to tell how much I loved this film, as to explain what it's about (""Well, it's about a whale and dolphins and a man and construction workers and a king of the universe and a guide for what to do in certain occasions""). But there are certain aspects in the movie that make it so fun to watch. Sam Rockwell's crazy enough to play someone with the name Zaphod Beeblebrox and Martin Freeman is perfect as a neurotic British man.The only thing I can say about this movie is don't panic and hey, losing your planet isn't the end of the world ;)",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

If you haven't read the books, it'll be a great movie; if you have read them, it'll still be a great movie. Sam Rockwell absolutely MAKES the role of Zaphod (I heard they were considering someone totally different and his audition just blew them away).

319,MightyAlz,"Good for newcomers, bad for fans.",6,17 July 2005,"OK, first off, I have read all the books, seen the TV series and heard all the radio series, so I may be biased.Pros: The CGI is terrific, and awe-inspiring, particularly during the planet building scenes.Sam Rockwell is very good as Zaphod Beeblebrox, and his American accent adds well to his portrayal of an incompetent president *cough* Bush *cough*.Stephen Fry is excellent at narrating the book, and the news graphics for the guide are all very effectively done.Mos Def also isn't too bad as Ford Prefect.Cons: Martin Freeman just isn't very good at portraying Arthur Dent and comes off as being unpleasant and unlikeable.Zooey Deschanel is also not a very good actress. It can also be blamed on the producers that they felt a need to have 50% of the cast American, despite the fact that the film is billed as being British.The main thing which spoils the entire film and makes the cons out way the pros is the seriousness of the film. The originals never had even the slightest amount of seriousness to them with even events like imminent death being treated with comedy. However, by far the worst thing about the film is the romantic subplot which has been added. It is absolutely TERRIBLE. Arthur Dent and Trillians relationship was little more than 3 lines in the originals. In this film it is stretched out in true Disney fashion over the entire film and completely undermines the rest of the film.One last point which may not seem too important to most people is the final line: ""The Restaurant is actually at the other end of the universe"". This proves that the scriptwriters who were overseeing Douglas Adam's script had not researched any back info on the story as they would have known that the Restaurant at the End of the Universe is a measure of time, not space.If you've never heard of Hitchhiker's guide to the Galaxy before, then you may enjoy this.If you are already a fan, then you are very likely to loathe this film.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

I personally loved The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, but I read the book, so I got something most people didn't. I loved the last part of the film, with the large, factory floor on the Planet Making Planet, Magrathea. The only flaws were areas where the script was foggy about things in the book. Other than that, the movie was very well done, and I recommend people go see it. I have bought the DVD and have watched it over and over again.

And that's how I sum up the movie. Maybe they felt if they forced themselves to laugh louder the feature would be better received by others. Sorry, no. There was no story, no plot, just a series of skits joined together with spit and CGI. It did have references to the television series, but just enough to hijack the title. Hitchhiker's reminded me of a throw-away script for Men In Black 3. In many ways it has its feel. The best parts of the movie are the scenes with alien interaction. However I think MiB was a better movie though Hitchhiker's is currently much higher rated. I'm sure it is garnishing extra points from fans who waited such a long time for any movie that comes anywhere close to the book/series with the Hitchhiker title.The film's opening is weak, dry, and absolutely uninspiring. Just minutes after spending $16.50 for two tickets, I lowered my expectations. On the other hand, Marvin the manic-depressive robot, is the best element of the picture. Alan Rickman's voice acting was good.I admit those in the theater influenced my vote, and I rated this 5/10 minus 1 for contrived, insincere laughter. P.S.

322,ikaros-3,A fitting addition to the H2G2 family,8,29 April 2005,"Okay. Before seeing it, if you haven't yet, please remember the following sequence:--The radio series came first.--The book differed from the radio series.--The TV miniseries and record album differed from each other, and from the book and radio series.--The text adventure game differed from all the preceding.--The graphic novel followed the book rather closely, but still differed from it and all the other preceding.--I haven't seen the towel version, but I suspect it also differs from all the preceding, too.That said, I went into the movie expecting it to be roughly the same story more or less, but not at all expecting to see the book faithfully translated to screen word for word.That's because, of course, the core of the screenplay was Adams' work. He started it, he can make the adjustments he sees necessary.And in short, I loved it.The movie runs at a breakneck pace, but not so blindingly fast that you miss some of the little details here and there. It even lingers on a couple of wonderful nods to the TV version, and there are a few excellent nods to Adams himself.I wasn't sure about Alan Rickman as the voice of Marvin anymore when we first met the character, until he delivered one line so perfectly, I have utterly forgotten why I had any reservations at all.Mos Def makes an acceptable Ford Prefect, although he seems to be all over the place, in terms of his motivation. Zooey Deschanel makes a splendid Trillian, and Sam Rockwell's Zaphod runs the range from the merely manic to the medicatably psychotic--it's quite a difference from Mark Wing-Davey's snarky would-be hipster, but it works well.Ah, but Martin Freeman. What a gem! Simon Jones is sadly too old to take up the reins anymore outside of radio, and Freeman is a worthy successor as everyman Arthur Dent.The updated animation of The Guide is absolutely terrific--it's reminiscent of Lord's work on the TV series in its minimalism, and yet carves out its own niche (complete with subtle sight gags)Highly recommended for the H2G2 fan--not sure how people who haven't read the book are going to do with it, though.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

Even if the random disjointedness of the narrative is not your cup of tea, it's hard to fathom how even the most linearly inclined viewer couldn't find this, at the very least, highly amusing. Perfectly cast and expertly directed, the movie finds its tone from the first frames with a very fun musical number and maintains that tone right until the touching tribute to Douglas Adams in the final frames. The special effects are top notch throughout and the creatures are terrificly ""old-school"". The Vogons were created by Jim Henson's creature shop and the rubbery monster look suits them very well.So basically, if you want a smart, funny (albiet a bit random) comedy that sort of plays as a cross between ""Galaxy Quest"" and ""Monty Python"", go and enjoy this terrific movie.

325,jeffthemartin,"See it once, then move on.",6,10 June 2005,"There are some movies that everybody should see. Movies that delve deeply into the human spirit, and vividly expose it so that we are moved, or even awed by the enormity of what we have just experienced. ""Schindler's List"" and ""The Shawshank Redemption"" fit into this category.There are other movies that connect less broadly with all of humanity, but are nevertheless masterpieces to a more select group of people. This category includes ""Star Wars"" ""Lord of the Rings"" and ""The Matrix."" Just below this is the category in which I would place ""The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy."" (By the way, there are many lower categories). It's not a bad movie, it's just not great, or excellent, or anything above fine.Movies are so expensive these days that nothing obviously inferior ever gets to theaters. There aren't any major factors that make this an inferior movie. It's silliness comes to mind, but that may well be a strength, in the opinion of many. There is the obligatory romance, explosions, bad guy(s), etc, etc, there's just not much beyond that. The plot of the movie is a little aimless. From a hilarious opening, (complete with singing dolphins singing which for me, are the musical highlight of the movie), the story quickly swells to world-wide proportions. At that point, however, it levels off to a series of strange and bizarre events and characters held together only by that fact that they happen to, or cross paths with, the main character, Arthur Dent. In the right context, a factory as big as a solar system could be a fascinating place. Unfortunately, it doesn't come across as very exciting in this movie. Likewise, many of the characters' physical oddities could be very funny, or even scientifically interesting. Instead, they are closer to grotesque.There were probably many CG effects in this movie that blended so perfectly that I didn't even notice them, but the ones I did notice didn't impress me. I'm told that the transportation device used in the huge factory is closely modeled after its description in the book, but it seems weird, and it looks even weirder. Even some of the effects that were well done (such as the transition between the different parts of Zaphod's personality) didn't add much to the story.The movie has the same wittiness and silliness as the book. I read the book 3 or 4 years ago, and I remember thinking, ""This book is obviously clever and well written, but it isn't exactly my cup of tea."" It's quirky, it's random, but also witty, and original. Although I once laughed for 15 minutes straight after reading a passage from it, I was not thoroughly captivated by it (as compared to say, my college roommate who once quoted from the book in his sleep). I thought the book was ""quite good"" but not ""excellent."" The movie is down-graded to ""good."" Any fan of Douglas Adams, or of the Discworld books, and most science fiction fans will probably enjoy watching this movie once, after which they will seek out better movies.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
326,mrforgetful,so long and thanks for all the fish.........YESSSSS!!!!,9,31 July 2005,"Being a huge fan of the Douglas Adams' fantastic Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy series, I couldn't wait to go see this movie. I grabbed my girlfriend and we went to the local movie theater and sat in the theater. From the opening credits, we just started laughing and enjoyed probably the most entertaining 2 hours or so since Pirates of the Caribbean.Granted, I'd wager that movies like this is an acquired taste, but if you enjoy monty python-esquire humor, coupled with aliens created by jim henson's creature shop and eye popping special effects, this is right up your alley.The acting is all great. Martin Freeman is excellent as Arthur Dent, and Sam Rockwell is hilarious as Zaphod Beeblebrox. Mos Def wouldn't have been my first choice as Ford Prefect, but then again I have no idea who else I'd cast so he does a pretty decent job and is nothing to complain about. Alan Rickman is perfect as the voice of Marvin the Paranoid Android.Now it'd be wrong for me to say that this movie is exactly like the book. In fact, it is quite different from the book. But that's OK, because for those of you that have read it, you know that when you think about it there's really not a whole lot to it story wise, and much of it is just explanations from the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy or stretched out conversations between the characters. So naturally, the filmmakers had to add some substance to the story to make it into a movie. This really isn't a bad thing at all, because it gives more insight to this wildly imaginative galaxy that Adams' has created for us. And it is still insanely entertaining. Don't worry, the best parts of the book are included.I do have to say that the end is a bit........meh, but not so bad that it ruins the whole movie. It's just could have used something else.So since seeing the movie, my girlfriend has decided to read the books now because she enjoyed it so much.

There was nothing wrong with it - the essential elements of the story are there, the casting was about right and all seemed to fit the roles - I think Martin Freeman as Arthur Dent was an excellent choice - and I was quite impressed with how they dealt with the tricky problem of a lead character having two heads, but somehow it lacked the spark it needed to make it from being an ordinary adaptation to being a great comedy - which it could have been. Maybe the atmosphere of Magarathia wasn't quite right. Maybe Marvin was not paranoid enough. But I think the real reason was that they did not make enough of some of the really stupid jokes in the original series - The joke about why Ford called himself Ford just sort of passed me by, whereas I thought it was inspired in the radio series. The other people in the cinema seemed to enjoy it well enough.I wouldn't particularly recommend, but I wouldn't tell you to steer clear either.Overall, underwhelmed one way or another. 7/10.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

I shouldn't be surprised I suppose- he has such a vast body of directing experience behind him! There's stuff in it that occurs that one is supposed to just suddenly know about, understand, relate to. And no, reading the book is NEVER a prerequisite for taking in a film. A flat, boring film that's just a mess. And though the following are NOT spoilers, I was pleased as the opening credits scrolled up the screen to see both Helen Mirren and Alan Rickman listed, and then equally disappointed to find they only portrayed VOICES in the flic.

331,TheFilmProf,A zany ride through a colorful and nonsensical universe,6,6 June 2006,"There are two possible reactions to ""The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy"": 'Bravo!' and 'Huh?' Not having been a Douglas Adams devotee myself, I guess I fall into the 'Huh?' group.""The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy,"" or ""H2G2"" in production shorthand, was based on, and by all reports quite faithfully so, Douglas Adams' original 1978 BBC radio comedy, his later 1979 book, and his later still TV series. Did I mention a stage play? Now, to make it into a film seems more of an exercise in inevitability. After all it's the only medium that it hadn't been converted to, and the idea of its manifest destiny as a film seems to be much, if not all, of the point. But it could be that the idea is about 25 years too late.Directed by feature first-timer Garth Jennings, ""H2G2"" is not at all a bad film. It's zany, off the wall, irreverent and unconventional, and it has all the elements a film needs to be engaging. Still, it ultimately has an inescapable flatness to it that only the most ardent aficionados of Mr. Adams' work will get beyond. The film is laden with insider jokes--surely funny to those in the loop--that will be missed by the larger and less informed film going audience. Also, the raw material here hearkens from a time when stoned-out humor was much more in vogue...Monty Python...The Firesign Theater, et al., and had this film been made then, its contemporaneousness would have given it much more audience appeal. But now with the passage of time, it may have missed its ride, so to speak.So, what's a guy to do when he wakes up to find that his house is being readied for demolition to make way for a highway bypass? And that his good friend is really an alien? And that the Earth will be destroyed in 12 minutes? This isn't just a bad hair day for Arthur Dent (Martin Freeman), it's the end of the world as he knows it--literally.Hitching a ride on a Vogan space ship, Arthur and his alien pal, Ford Prefect (Mos Def) head off on a madcap, whimsical, and at times hard to understand journey. They bounce around from one part of the universe to another rather randomly and without much apparent purpose--which is precisely the purpose, apparently. And therein lies what is most problematic. There's never a sense that when they get to wherever it is they may be going, there is any significance to it. Events are connected mostly by their similar off the wall humor more so than by any plot curve, and consequently the film becomes a loose series of encounters with odd space denizens, surreal space environs, and spaced-out absurdities.The film relies heavily on the visual eccentricities of its characters: The large and slow-moving, Vogons, known chiefly for their bureaucratic officiousness and exceedingly bad poetry; the outlandish, glam-rock style of the two-headed Zaphod (Sam Rockwell) and the mechanically multi-legged Humma Kavula (John Malkovich) a sort of missionary on the Dali-like planet of Viltvodle, home of the Jatravartids. Toss in a chronically depressed robot, Marvin (voiced by Alan Rickman), who is marginally amusing in his human-like characteristics, and the inexplicable, out of place Questular Rontok (Anna Chancellor), a powerful (but with no indication as to why) human character among the Vogans, and you wind up with a collection of rather hard to remember names, and situations that generate no drama or enthusiasm. The only semblance of continuity springs from the romantic sub-plot between Arthur and Tricia--later, Trillian (Zooey Daschanel)--and it's not too well-developed at that. That the film eventually takes on the appearance of a climax is nearly as much a function of random chance as the events that precede it.""The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy"" isn't a 'love it or hate it' kind of film. It's more like a 'love it or ignore it' one. It will certainly find a niche audience of enthusiasts, and, perhaps by intent, has all the earmarks of being labeled a 'cult classic'. But maybe we should wait another 25 years before conferring that status on it.© 2005",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
332,wizard42,Don't Panic,6,5 May 2005,"If you are a fan of any of the original works (radio, books, or television) that this movie is based on subtract one and half stars from the above rating. Frankly it is hard to decide where to begin when discussing this film. The acting is mostly solid, although Zooey Deschanel's Trillian doesn't really work (which may just be a function of the script as she ranges back and forth between competent, and not-so-competent). The directing is straight forward, and while the director may linger a little to long on the opening shot of the book, it works. The problem is that the changes that have been made to the storyline do not work. Yes, in the first series, and first book, there was an underlying love triangle between Arthur, and Trillian, and Trillian and Zaphod. However, it has always been made very clear, that Arthur's interest in Trillian is not returned! This is for a good reason. Trying to turn this into the Arthur loves Trillian story, which the film does, is not successful. It takes too much away from the main point regarding the building of the Earth, and it's role as a super-computer. Turning Arthur Dent into a hero (demanding that they go rescue Trillian) and then turning him back into a hesitant nebbish later in the film doesn't work. If your protagonist is going to grow mid way through a film and goes and saves the day, then he can't go back to his old ways. It is pretty obvious what happened here. The studio chiefs, who, ironically enough, are perfect matches for the imaginless bureaucratic Vogon's, decided that they needed to mainstream the movie. As a result they demanded a love story. They also demanded more action, hence Trillian needing to be rescued. What they in turn created was a mess. The movie retains enough of the original material, and some very nice quirky additions, to work, but it is not put together as capably. It's a real shame because the original material had a great deal of appeal, and a very loyal fan base. This movie could have expanded that appeal, and the fan base, but I suspect that it will not do so.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
333,Buskieboy,"If THIS is what they came up with, why'd they bother?",1,3 October 2005,"***COULD CONTAIN SPOILERS, BE WARY!***The only reason I gave this a vote of 4 was for the very good eye-candy. Otherwise I am so bloody disappointed with what they did to one of my all time favorite books/TV mini series, that I don't know where to start. I guess I'll start with the positive. This movie has some fantastic, eye popping special effects. I'm not just talking about CGI, but some of it was very imaginative. They used unusual angles and odd vehicles and funny surprises with the CGI. I am also under the impression that this must have been filmed digitally, because it is so clean and sharp, the ""live action"" looks just as sharp as the CGI which helps blend it together. The ship is odd, but has a great design, although you may be disappointed as it has been altered from the original TV version, drastically. At first I didn't like it, but then it kind of grew on me. The terrible thing was how they did Marvin. I didn't like it at all. Ironically, the original Marvin is in a scene at Vogsphere, in the room for filling out forms! The new Marvin is small, with a impossibly giant head and no mouth. I though that was a bad move on 2 fronts. First, Alan Rickman's voice sounded exactly as it was, a voice-over! Secondly, it somehow took away from any kind of expressions, not that the original had a moving mouth, but I would have preferred a mouth of some kind. They could have come up with a really cool one that either moved or lit up while Alan Rickman talked. They also really should have had his voice coming out of the robot. It sounded cheap and disembodied, as I said like a voice over. Over all I hated the pace of the movie, in about 10 minutes we were already watching Arthur and Ford being ejected into space! One of the things I loved about the TV version and the books, was the dialog and the wonderful gags that the much beloved (and missed) Mr. Adam's wrote. Things like: ""Hyperspace is rather like being drunk."" said Ford""What's wrong with being drunk?"" queried Arthur""Ask a glass of water."" answered FordOr perhaps instead of spending about 2 minutes in the pub and glossing over the reactions of the patrons to Ford and Arthur, they should have done that fantastic scene justice. The whole thing in the beginning was that you were just like Arthur, totally perplexed and astonished about Ford and the Vogons and all of it. The director et al, seemed to be in a rush to get to the special effects, and forgot all about the humour of the earlier scenes. My biggest problem is with Zaphod Beeblebrox and Sam Rockwell. Now I love Sam Rockwell, I think he's a fantastic actor. I loved him in ""The Green Mile"" and Galaxy Quest and did a bang on job as Chuck Barris in Confessions of a Dangerous Mind, but who told him to make Zaphod such an absolute idiot and maniac. He actually seemed like a violent psychopath, and the stupid way they did his 2 heads made him down right ugly and almost evil. Did Sam Rockwell even watch or read anything about this character? He's not a Billy the Kid or a cowboy or ""good ol' boy. He's an egomaniac, but he cares about those around him, because they (in his mind at least) adore him! I HATED his portrayal of Zaphod. At the end, he makes him out to be nothing more than a brain dead moron! Zaphod was a nutter, but a nutter we all kinda liked. Over all, I can't understand why this movie turned out the way it did. Douglas Adams was a producer and helped write the screenplay! I wasn't expecting a completely identical remake, but I also didn't want it changed to this. Isn't that the point of remakes, we want to see our favorites, but only if you give them a wonderful update with today's tools. When you fix something that's not broke, you break it. That's what happen to the Planet of the Apes remake. They screwed with the story too much. I miss all the great lines and stories. Case in point was the Deep Thought story. In the original series, you had a wonderfully funny scene with Majikthise and Vroomfondel, the representatives from the union of philosophers demanding that the question not be answered, as it will put them out of work. Deep Thought tells them that they'll be on the gravy train for life, as what answer he comes up with will be hotly debated for eons! Vroomfondel turns to his friend and says:""Geeze, Majikthise, why can't we think like that?"" Or how about the great restaurant at the end of the universe, Milliways? *sigh* I'm very disappointed in this movie. We don't want a new story, but an updated new looking favorite. Play with it, but don't you dare rewrite it. Oh well, at least I still have my original TV mini series to watch.

Why?It's just not a good movie! It has no rhythm, it is not (very) funny, and the part that stars John Malkovich is simply a waste of time.That's sad, because they tried: You'll find many references to the books and the radio series, you'll even see good ol' Marvin from the TV Series, but you don't have the time to enjoy it, because all these things stay in the background, while the plot leads us relentlessly to the next scene. All the nice scenes (e.g. the Bypass-argument at the beginning, the Deep Thought scenes, vogon poetry) feel as if someone put them there because the fans would recognize it but at the same time they had to be cut in half in order to stay under 100 Minutes of running time...Let's face it - my private opinion: They should have sticked to the BBC Series. Cut the Restaurant at the end of the universe-scenes and you'll have nice, funny, well balanced 120 Minutes of the Guide.But like this - it was a waste of my time...Positive moments: Zaphod is quite cool, and I enjoyed the cameo of veteran Arthur Dent from the BBC Series as Magrathean announcer.Sorry Doug, this is surely not what your fans were waiting for two decades!",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
335,cookie_monster,great adventure,9,1 May 2005,"Being too young too ever experience the original's of this story, I really had no idea what this film entailed. I had only ever heard brief mutters in the school yard as a child but i never wondered what this hitchhikers guide to the galaxy was. The film has been promoted to the extremes so it was very hard not to notice in the leading weeks to its release. I wondered what the hype was all about so I booked some tickets for a showing. The great British humour hit me from the start and reminded me of some Monty python films in an updated form. This set the tone for the whole film. A modern remake like this would never have had the same outcome if the casting was American. Stephen Fry was a joy to listen to as narrator, as he described all the wonderful creatures and objects that Arthur Dent and the crew came upon.Even without prior knowledge of anything to do with the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy, I thoroughly enjoyed this film. I know the fuss that is brought up when re-makes are made, or adaptations from books/comics are put on film, so thats why I don't read books or comic because I love film and if you sit through a film to criticise it because it doesn't match the book, then stick to the damn books",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
336,doggans,"""The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"" has this to say about film adaptations:",9,30 April 2005,"Whenever a much-loved franchise is being brought to the big screen, there are going to be upset fans. If a film is in development for a particularly long time, say, over 20 years, expectations rise, and the chances of fans being upset increase exponentially. For example, when the film Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace came out, many fans were outraged that the film was anything less than Citizen Kane in a galaxy far, far away. In the case of the film version of Douglas Adams' masterpiece saga, almost every fan had their own version of the film planned out in their head. Many were outraged to discover that Garth Jennings had not, in fact, consulted them as to how tall Marvin the Paranoid Android should be. However, many fans who believe themselves to be more sensible knew going into the film that a perfect Hitchhiker film would be virtually impossible, and therefore finitely improbable, and since the filmmakers do not have an Improbability Drive, a perfect film would not be made. They also knew that the film would be different than any previous version of Hitchhiker, like every previous version was different than any that came before it. Many of these fans were able to leave the theater very satisfied indeed.I am one of these fans. I had been hyping myself up for the film for a very long time, but I was always keeping myself in check, reminding myself that this would not be exactly how I envisioned it. As an amateur filmmaker, that was hard to do, as I rarely read any book without knowing exactly how I would composite the shot and what the tempo of the score would be. Nevertheless, I kept my own personal view in check, and reminded myself that if I could survive the BBC TV series, I could survive anything that the Guide had to throw at me. As it turns out, I didn't just survive it, I loved it.The film starts off on the right note with a show-stopping musical number based on one of the most popular lines from the saga. This immediately sets the tone for the whole movie. The song manages to be both hilarious and catchy, and the melody is used very well throughout the whole score. (Incidentally, I must praise Joby Talbot's excellent score, which manages to combine John Williamsian adventurous themes, futuristic electronic beats, and even Broadway-worthy show tunes.)As much as I loved the dialogue from previous versions about the bypass (Beware of the Leopard, points A, B, and C, etc.), I , unlike a number of fans, do not think the film suffered by having it cut down. Most of the cuts from previous versions, though I would have liked to see them, I was okay with. (I noticed these purist fans didn't seem to complain when Lady Cynthia Fitz-Miltion's speech was cut from the radio version to the book version.) Even though I had always wanted Hugh Laurie in the role, Martin Freeman was an amazing Arthur Dent. Granted, the role was originally written for Simon Jones, but Freeman plays the part very well. The character is not as sarcastic as he has been in the past, but it's understandable given his predicament. Mos Def is the best Ford Prefect I've ever seen. He does an excellent job with the difficult task of conveying Ford as both intelligent and insane. Sam Rockwell is just the annoying prick I always pictured Zaphod as. (Although I'm not sure why he got top billing, but then again, I also wasn't sure why they said ""based on the book"" and neglected to mention the radio version, except that the book is better known.) Zooey Deschanel is the intelligent, charming, witty astrophysicist Trillian that Sandra Dickinson wasn't. What's more, she actually has a personality in this version. I think that might be a first. The always-wonderful Stephen Fry and Alan Rickman were of course wonderful in their voice roles. Rickman even sounded a bit like Steven Moore. Although I do feel that credit must go to Warwick Davis for providing very Marvinlike motions. Acting without speaking is difficult, and Davis pulled it off well. And Bill Nighy as Slartibartfast...I had read several reviews saying they were amazed at the depth Nighy brought to the character. I sort of shrugged these reviews off, thinking Slartibartfast was a character that it wasn't possible to bring depth to. But Nighy is excellent.Simon Jones, the TV Marvin costume, and the face of the late Douglas Adams all have excellent cameos as well.As for the new characters, I heard many complaints that they were pointless additions. (Yes, from the same people who get upset that subplots about man proving the nonexistance of God got left on the cutting room floor.) I, however, didn't think they were distracting from the story or anything, and I felt they were setting things up for the sequel. Also, I enjoyed how the Vogons and the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast were more central to the plot than usual.I didn't think the love story ruined the film, but then, I've always been a bit of a romantic.Some people claim that newcomers to the Guide won't be able to follow the plot. I went to see it with a few friends, one of whom had never experienced the Guide in any form, but he followed it perfectly. So, if you are paying attention, you should be able to understand most of the film as best as it can be understood, but just the same, you might want to bring one of your hoopy frood friends who has the radio play, book, TV series, and computer game committed to memory along to explain any loose ends.All in all, the film, while not perfect, was excellent.

338,dapplez,This is not HHGG. This movie is an impostor!,1,18 March 2011,"In theory, making this should have been a walk in the park. The BBC television series was very good, but had a limited budget. With CGI special effects and some money, this movie had enormous potential.But the first problem is you are taking a six-part TV series (which didn't cover the entire radio series or book) and squeezing it down to a two hour movie. But it could have been done, if you retained the essentials.And it should be mentioned to all the reviewers who say ""I didn't read the book,"" Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy did not start out as a book. Well, yes, it is the title of a book, but a fictional book within the story, with the words ""Don't Panic!"" on the cover.The franchise started as a radio series on BBC. So it began life with some definite ideas about how the characters were to be played, and were to sound. The BBC television series generally improved on the performances, without changing the characters.So there were hopes for this movie that it would continue in that vein, maintain the concept but improve on the performances and production polish.Then something went fundamentally wrong.I have to assume the blame belongs to the director Garth Jennings and the writer Karey Kirkpatrick. Apparently, they not only didn't read the book, but didn't listen to the radio show or watch the BBC series (there are other iterations, such as an audio book). Was this too much work? Someone must have told them what the characters were supposed to be like, and they resented it, because they turned the original characters on their head, into the opposite of the original Douglas Adams conception.Some of these actors must have known the original version, yet, given the result, it seems the director must have forced them into a very different performance.In short, what director Garth Jennings has created is deeply disrespectful of Douglas Adams.I have listened to the original Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy radio series many times over the years. I saw the BBC version on TV, and I own the DVD and have watched it many times. I have read the book more than once. And I have listened to the various audio versions, which have material not found in the book.And I will do it again.Why do I do this? Because Douglas Adams' work is so wonderfully witty and insightful that I enjoy it every time as though it were the first time.I own this movie on DVD. I had to force myself to watch it to the end. I will never watch it again. Why? Because I am not a masochist.Let me put it to you this way: If Garth Jennings had remade ""Miracle on 34th Street"" he would have made Santa Claus the drunk on the parade float, his lawyer would have spent Christmas in jail on contempt of court charges, the little girl's mother would have been fired, and the girl would have died on Christmas eve because no one would buy her matches.He just doesn't have a clue what this story is about.I do not often rate a movie a 1. But it is hard to imagine how this movie could have been worse. It is one long chalk screech for anyone who knows the real HHGG.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
339,wxid,"Almost, but not entirely, unlike a bad movie.",7,3 May 2005,"Douglas Adams must be sitting up in heaven, feet hanging over the edge of a cloud somewhere, harp slung happily over his should, sipping at a beer, generally happy with how those left behind completed his movie. Or not. After all, Adams was an atheist, so maybe he's not even looking. The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy has finally hit the big screen and for the most part it's worthy of the name.First off, however, the obligatory disclaimers. Yes, I read the books, or at least the original (actual) trilogy. Yes, I own the BBC TV series on DVD - dodgy effects and all. But no, I've never really tracked down the radio series - I'm not that big of a fan.The movie starts off in largely familiar territory. After a slightly repositioned Guide entry about dolphins, and an astoundingly catchy tune, we have Arthur Dent (Freeman) finding his home about to be demolished for a motorway bypass. Ford (Mos Def) arrives with beer and peanuts, rather successfully, if temporarily, deflecting the workmen from the task. Ford of course is an alien researcher for the Guide, stuck on Earth for many years. Sadly, the update from ""Harmless"" to ""Mostly Harmless"" is cut from the movie, leaving us with no payoff from Ford's research.In fact, quite a lot of dialogue, much of it the wonderfully colourful and often tangential nature that made Adams' work so enthralling, is gone. Familiar exchanges have been sliced, and Guide entries have been shortened. This kind of editing is sustained throughout the movie, leaving fans  even casual ones like myself - feeling as if somebody really didn't quite get the point.Not only Arthur's home is scheduled for demolition, but the entire planet discovers they too are about to lose their homes as a Vogon fleet arrives to do the job. These creations from the Jim Henson workshops are quite remarkable. They fill a role that would have been ruined by use of pure CGI Vogons, and do it admirably in an 80s BBC production sense - if that BBC production had been able to utilise about ten times the budget. Simply put, they work and they work extremely well for the rest of the movie. These Vogons are not callous or evil, but they are the epitome of bureaucracy and paper-shuffling - the exact kind of people Adams' had it in for in the first place.Hitching a ride, of course, on the Vogon space craft, Ford and Arthur are soon discovered and subjected to the torture of Vogon poetry. More disappointment here in that the Guide entry for Vogon poetry is restricted to a pure voice-over during the reading. The Guide shines when it is on screen, such as the entries about, well, the Guide itself, and Vogons. The updated, yet deliberately understated style is wonderful without being twee, and Fry does great service as the voice.Visually, the film is a treat. The effects are good, and often subtle, in a way George Lucas simply doesn't comprehend. There are little prizes for the fans buried throughout the movie, from the old Marvin having a cameo of his own through to the appearance of Douglas Adams' head itself in tribute to the man who made it all possible. I've seen much criticism of the new Marvin, but frankly Marvin works. The idea of this Marvin being a psychologically flawed attempt at a ""plastic pal who's fun to be with"" is easily swallowed.Among the most glaring of flaws is Zaphod's second head, which is given a hideously awful incarnation and subsequently sidelined for most of the movie. Clearly even the makers knew just how bad their method of dealing with the head really was.Acting wise, the cast do perfectly acceptable jobs with their allotted characters. Freeman works Arthur's new development path well. Mos Def is a surprisingly decent Ford, even with many of his best lines excised. Rockwell is fine, though the Zaphod he is given to work with is rather too much Homer Simpson. No longer cool and froody, Zaphod spends much of the movie being stupid. Deschanel as the love interest is perfect, though she spends too little time on screen.As for the plot, I've seen it described as a mess. It isn't. It is, however, full of contrivance. The entire Humma Kavula sub-plot seems unnecessary and put in place purely to achieve two things - the removal of Zaphod's second head (which the writers and effects people seemed incapable of dealing with) and the set up for a funny, but hugely contrived, sequence regarding a certain gun. There are other changes to the original, as there should be, but largely the movie is recognisable as Hitchhikers, and carries with it Adams' unmistakable stamp. While he may not have approved every detail it seems certain that this, mainly, is the movie he wanted to make - mistakes and all.There is, however, one completely unforgivable scene. Right at the end of the Magrathean plot, just before our heroes board the Heart of Gold, there's a sequence which is truly hideous. It's the ""happy ending"" in all its glory. It's an atrociously sickening concept seemingly aimed at making things ""better"". Yet it's a robotic, shallow, and creepy concept if you think about it. Either way, it should never have been. Of all the changes, of all the cuts, this was the one part of the film where I was left stunned, thinking why, why, why? However overall, Hitchhikers is not the books. It is not the TV series (though it does have the same haunting opening score - that brought a strange shivering to my skin). It could certainly have been better, but thankfully it could also have been much, much worse. It is Adams - albeit watered down for the international audience. It is funny. And it is almost entirely unlike a bad movie. Almost.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
340,MilesPieri,Mostly humourless,4,29 April 2005,"The road to a cinematic Hitch-Hikers has been well documented as long and tortuous. What began as a BBC radio show way back in 1978 has seen incarnations as a series of novels, a TV show, interactive fiction and several stage versions. A film has been on the cards for at least two decades and now, at last, we have what Hitch-Hikers creator Douglas Adams always hoped would be the ultimate imagining of his SF-comedy. Let's get right to the point here, this movie is going to be a huge disappointment to the ""trilogy's"" many fans. The casual film-goer is unlikely to be too impressed either. It seems incredible that something that has languished in turnaround so long has come out so half-baked and semi-formed. Maybe the length of time it's taken to get this show on the road is much of the problem, though. Disney clearly spent a fair amount on this production (although the SFX are variable) and they've really tried to appeal to the lowest common denominator. The problem is it's all too rushed and confusing for the uninitiated yet severely lacking in true Hitch-Hikers spirit for aficionados. Bizarrely many of Adams best lines and jokes are left in - but without the punchlines. A good example is the, hugely truncated, opening where earthman Arthur Dent's house is to be demolished. Adams, of course, had this scene mirror the bigger picture of the bureaucracy-obsessed Vogon destruction of the Earth. Here this doesn't play out at all and the whole sequence falls flat. Another example is Ford Prefect's (Mos Def) constant use of his towel in moments of danger. Fans will know where this comes from but to anyone else it just looks like very desperate slapstick. A subplot, original to this movie, concerning the quest for a 'Point of view gun' is pointless and goes nowhere at all, seemingly added to give John Malcovich something to do in one of several wasted cameos. The late Adams himself is credited as co-author of the screenplay, and it would be fascinating to know just how much of the script can fairly be attributed to him. The movie isn't without it's pleasures. There are some nice touches such as the beautiful Magrathea interiors, an appearance from TV's Marvin and the original radio shows Arthur (Simon Jones) plus any fan is going to get goosebumps hearing The Eagles 'Journey of the Sorcerer' as we are first introduced to 'The Book' itself. Having said that, the 1981 BBC TV show, which Adams never much cared for, had far wittier graphics to illustrate the Guide than anything this film can muster up. The cast battle valiantly with a generally inane script and flat direction but in the end this just wasn't worth the time, effort and love than so many people spent on it over such a long period. It pains me to quote Marvin the Paranoid Android here but as far as The Hitch-Hikers Guide To The Galaxy goes - ""I've seen it, it's rubbish.""",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

The hitchhikers guide movie portrays the character exactly how the are in the book, which is good compared to other movies based on books that I've seen, which almost butcher the characters or story. Now the movie is based on the book based on the radio series. The Movbie should be though of as a separate version of the Guide and not as a Based on a book movie. Douglas Adams wrote the script himself. Fileed with witty jokes and wonderful deliveries form Marvin the paranoid , Brilliant, Chronically depressed robot, Aurthur ford and trillian, and the infamous slartibartifast, all hitchhikers fans will rejoice at the great and wonderful job the director did with the movie.

343,am2star,"Get the BBC series, save your money",1,30 April 2005,"Having been a fan of ""The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"" trilogy for a quarter of a century, I had hoped for the best for this movie. This is NOT the book, BBC series, radio series, or video game.The movie starts somewhat in the middle. Those familiar with the book will understand the reference to dolphins. Unfortunately, the title sequence is one big inside joke. Those knowing the story will enjoy it for what it is. Newcomers will be totally lost.And, the book itself is introduced almost as an afterthought. What few references used from the book are humorous, it is not a big part of the tale. Stephen Fry does a fine job as the voice of the book, but too little time is spent.Arthur Dent is played as a lovesick man, not the confused and befuddled Brit from the book. His biggest problem is not that the Earth has been destroyed, but that he lost the girl.That girl is Patricia McMillan, or Trillion. She is played by Zooey Deschanel. But, unlike all that we know, she has no reason to be here. We know nothing about her, except that she is the object of Arthur's affection.So, how do Arthur and Trillian meet? Ford Prefect, a friend of Arthur's, rescues him by using a ring device that signals space craft of a hopeful hitchhiker. So, just in the nick of time. Unfortunately, the movie doesn't explain why they get picked up only to get tossed off.And, like in the book, they get picked up the second time by President of the Galaxy, Zaphod Beeblebrox. Why is he President of the Galaxy? The film only says because he won an election. What does the President to? According to the movie, sign his name to things.Zaphod is played by Sam Rockwell. And, Zaphod does have two heads, well faces would be a better term. This makes the interaction of the two heads impossible. The three arms does work like we would expect.And, the story is now completely different. Fans are going to miss some of the best lines. No mention of bricks. No mention of being drunk. And, the biggest waste of time is the towel. It is never explained for its importance (a book reference would be great) and it is far more prominent than it should be.There are some humorous gags with the Heart of Gold spaceship, but it is nothing like described. Marvin the robot, is odd looking, without the overwhelming limitations that is Marvin's life.So, what is the plot? None that I can see. Just a lot of stuff happens. But, unlike what fans know, there is a forced plot line with Trillian being captured by the Vogons just so she can be rescued.What a waste that this movie is. Arthur Dent is not overwhelmed. Ford is not the happy-co-lucky researcher. Zaphod is obnoxious as opposed to adventurous. And Trillian is boring.Save your money. If you liked the books, you will hate this movie. Buy the DVD set of the original BBC series. If you haven't read the book, get a copy and read it. If you like it, get the DVD set.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

I went with friends who wanted to see it. I walked into the theater with low expectations, and the film utterly failed to meet them.The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is supposed to be a comedy. I laughed out loud ONCE, during the ""sock-monkey"" scene. Near the end, I very nearly fell asleep.The film has no compelling storyline. It just meanders around aimlessly. The characters are similarly underdeveloped. To make matters worse, Sam Rockwell's character, Zaphod Beeblebrox, is positively annoying.At one point Marvin the robot says, ""Incredible... it's even worse than I thought it would be.""

(how cool was that by the way,...I hope someone noticed!...Life,...don't talk to me about life.....).I don't remember any movie being better than the book until now, although I have to admit, Zooey played quite a part in my approval.The casting was perfection.I was worried about having another actor play Ford Prefect since the original was so great, but Mos Def totally landed this one! It would not have taken much to find a better actress to play Trisha McMillan due tot he fact that the original was too dumb to be so smart, but no one could have played it better than Zooey Deschanel, no one!

(although apparently not forgotten) I don't actually remember Humma Kavula even being in the book I read or the original series, but John can play just about any role to perfection...especially the odd ones.As for the comedy, there wasn't much more than there was in the book.

350,Mikeonalpha99,"""Don't panic!""",6,17 September 2005,"Having grown up with the radio show, read the book at an early age, and then seen the BBC television series, I was interested to see what they would do with the feature film. Well, this movie version of Hitchkikers Guide to the Galaxy is sort of a mixed bag.The film certainly romps along quite merrily, and there are plenty of strange characters, improbable, silly situations, and some spectacularly expensive special effects sequences. The producers have also largely kept Douglas Adam's legacy pretty much intact. But its greatest fault is that it simply doesn't live up to the reputation that preceded it.The film also suffers the problem of familiarity. Those viewers who have not read the book, or are not in some way familiar with the story, will probably be scratching their heads in bewonderment at the torrent of talk, much of it of an oblique and scientific nature, and all of it delivered with a parched, dry, and insouciant British wit.The film is narrated by the guide book of the title (the voice of Stephen Fry), so director Garth Jennings can interject passages of Adams' text, accompanied by amusing animation, into the plot's intergalactic shenanigans. This actually works pretty well, and it doesn't swamp and slow-down the pacing of the main story.One morning, Englishman Arthur Dent (Martin Freeman) wakes up to find that his farmhouse in rural England is about to be bulldozed for a freeway. Up pops his pal Ford Prefect (Mos Def) to tell him to forget about it. Ford confesses that he is actually an alien, and he tells Arthur that his house doesn't matter anymore because Earth itself is about to be demolished by the Vogons of the planet Vogsphere to make way for an inter-space expressway.Just as the planet is about to explode, Arthur and Ford transport themselves onto a Vogon spacecraft. The two escape only to have to plead for their lives with the commander of the Vogon Constructor Fleet (voice of Richard Griffiths), a gigantic rhinoceros-like creature in whom Arthur discerns a poetic soul and a longing for love. This is the first of many tests and narrow escapes.Arthur and Ford are rescued from the Vogons by president of the galaxy Zaphod Beeblebrox (Sam Rockwell), Earth's only other survivor, Trillian (Zooey Deschanel), and their maniacally depressed android, Marvin (voiced by Alan Rickman). Madcap adventures ensure as this mis-matched group of outlaws wonder the galaxy, trying to escape from the Vogon army.But the group is also given a mission; they have to find ""the meaning of life, the universe and everything,"" a search that takes them to a variety of different exotic planets. Some of the best of the British A-list actors fill the minor roles and voice-overs, particularly Bill Nighy as a planetary architect, Helen Mirren as the voice of Deep Thought, a supercomputer whose task is to compute the meaning of life, Alan Rickman as the voice of Marvin, the terminally depressed robot, and John Malkovich as a shrewd, half-bodied religious leader.Rockwell is extravagantly narcissistic as two-headed Zaphod. Only Def is poorly cast; he just seems too small and inexperienced to play the dashing Ford. The brightest presence is the always-fresh Zooey Deschanel, who has a light touch otherwise absent.The film is goofy and silly, and for the novice viewer probably totally mystifying. The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is sometimes audacious in its metaphysics, along with its attitudes towards religion, politics, and life.The consummate geeks will probably love it, and the loyal fans of the books in the series, will be left feeling mostly pleased with the outcome, even though it doesn't quite measure up to the original sacred text. The makers of ""Hitchhiker's Guide"" don't quite get it right, but they don't exactly miss either. Mike Leonard September 05.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

Unfortunately, the film is as bad as its worst review. The concept of the Hitchhiker's Guide was barely used. It was depressing that the ancient t.v. production could so far outdo the film in spite of the film's quality graphics and good cast. The worst acting was Zooey Deschanel's. The story didn't hang together well at all. We were warned about the horrible movie to come by the horrific theme song, which took all the punch out of a funny line.

352,cameragod,Look out Terry Pratchett.,4,29 April 2005,"Let this film be a warning to you Terry. If you don't hurry up and have made a decent Discworld film one day you will die and there will be a horrible film adaptation of your books like this one. It's not so much a film of the Hitchhikers Guide as a Hitchhikers Guide-ish flavoured film for Americans. Yuck!The Hitchhikers Guide was never about a stunning plot line. It was never good Sci-Fi the silly plot was just there to hang the fantastic dialog to. Douglass wrote such funny dialog why mess about with it? Why cut out most of the actually funny lines? It can't be a time thing as so much pointless bland banter was added. So why rip out the heart of the movie the one thing that made it different and funny.Alright. Lets not compare the book to the movie but it is hard not to compare the movie to the radio and TV series. Look at Sin City. In the comic you had what was basically a brilliant story board for a movie. So they made it and it worked. THHGTTG had a fantastic radio show with brilliant dialog that could have been the base of a very funny movie but the movie makers ignored it and ended up with a weak THHGTTG flavoured movie. I didn't really like the TV series when it came out but I thought it was better/funnier than the Movie. After seeing the movie a few days ago last night I got out the TV series on DVD to see if I was remembering the TV show as better than it was. Nope. Forget the bad FX, OT acting and glacial pacing and a few seconds into it and you can see what the film forgot. Arthur Dent is not the poor everyman/victim character, he is a slightly removed observer, a sarcastic sod that continually spouts dry one lines. FORD ""How are you feeling?"" ARTHUR ""Like a military academy bits of me keep parsing out."" Endless insightful and clever throw away lines that you wish you could think of at parties, keep zinging out taking you by surprise. They are all gone from the movie. The pitiful few that remain are the probably only funny moments in the movie and I'm sorry but if you laugh at ""Look out he's got a towel!"" then you have been seriously staved of good comedy. I know that American audiences are renowned for not getting sarcasm but I think the producers of this movie underestimated them and did us all a disservice by removing the one thing that made THHGTTG more than just another silly Sci-Fi story.

As everyone knows, the Earth was NOT destroyed to make way for a hyperspace bypass, was it? The British sure have their gall telling people it was, and claiming that there are people on other planets, such as the Golgafrinchans and the Magratheans. What do you take me for? I'm not stupid! Where's the proof? Show me the physical evidence that Zaphod Beeblebrox is a real person! As usual, the British think they are the center of the universe, or at least the galaxy. Do the Canadians get any credit for existing, too? No! It is all about Brits, Brits, Brits! You got something against Americans? Garth Jennings could have at least put a Chinese character into the plot, or a Belgian.And this Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy -- another ethnocentric British creation. Why, it only covers the Milky Way Galaxy. There are lots of other galaxies in the universe, like the Snicker's Galaxy and the Kit Kat Nebula and the Cadbury Creamy Black Hole --- 571 billion galaxies, to be precise. But all this movie talks about is Britain's own personal galaxy, like UK is the center of the entire bloomin universe. Well, I wasn't fooled.

355,sarazin1,Special Guide To The Galaxy,8,29 June 2005,"If you are a fan of Douglas Adams Hitchhiker series, then you would know where this movie came from originally. Therefore, i am reviewing the movie as a sci-fi fantasy adapted from his five book trilogy which had its beginnings on British radio.The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy or H2G2 , began in 1978 as a BBC radio series that spawned a novel, a TV series and four more books which Adams called a 'trilogy of five parts'. It was also make into a stage play,comic books and a computer game.The movie version of H2G2 had been in the works for more than 20 years. Through the 80's and 90's, Adam wrote a few screenplay drafts. His latest, which was revised by Karey Kirkpatrick after Adam's death of a heart attack in 2001, is the basis of this movie.The story opens in England where Arthur Dent ( Martin Freeman ) wakes up one day to find bulldozers coming to flatten his house to build a road.Soon, he learns that his buddy, Ford Prefect ( Mos Def ), is actually an alien visiting Earth to do a research for hitchhiker's guide, and that he uses a bath towel to fend off trouble.However, Ford has more bad news for Arthur : He has just discovered that the Vogons, an alien race that looks like cousins of Jabba The Hut, are coming to destroy the Earth.The good news is that Ford will help 'beam' Arthur on to passing spaceships and hitchhike across the galaxy. As lick would have it, they land on a huge vogon craft ; and we learn that the bureaucratic Vogons are not really a cruel race. They just live red tape and read their poetry which is so bad that it can torture listeners to death.Arthur and Ford quickly transfer to another ship commanded but the galaxy's president Zaphod Beeblebrox ( Sam Rockwell ) who has another face concealed under his tunic. Also on board are an Earthling named Trillian ( Zooey Deschanel ) and Marvin the android ( voice by Alan Rickman ) Other highlights include a Japanese schoolgirl with five torsos and a pair of white socked legs, and a meeting with Humma Kavula ( John Malkovich ) the galactic preacher.Under the directorial debut of Garth Jennings, the point of the movie is not to make too much of a point.I believe it just tries to be cute. The sets, creature make-up and dialogue are all designed to look cute even if it had no dramatic impact.And if you cannot find anything amusing about the movie, Don't PANIC . Just imagine that somewhere, in a distant galaxy, some dolphins are laughing at the way they are portrayed. Think about it......",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
356,david_topping,Don't expect the earth....,5,9 May 2005,"To put this in context I'm not one of those who objects to the Guide being remade, first it's been remade many times from Radio to TV to books and second all of those remakes were written or at least under some control of the sadly deceased Douglas Adams. But by no means though would I call myself a 'fan'.**Spoilers On**Very briefly, just in case you don't know the story, if indeed there really is one, the plot centres on the adventures of a pretty average British man who wakes up one day to find that his house is scheduled for demolition to make way for a bypass being built. Ironically this is also the day that the planet earth will be demolished to make way for a hyper space bypass. Arthur is rescued from the destruction by his close friend Ford Prefect, who it turns out is not human at all but a writer for the Galactically famous book which is the title of the film. From here the two take off on a series of deliberately increasingly improbable vignette adventures, getting thrown off an alien ship only to be instantly picked up by another ship which uses an ""infinite improbability drive"" to justify the impossibility of any situation they find themselves in.**Spoilers Off**The vignettes and adventures really only serve as a setting to give reign to the author's sense of the ridiculous and love of poking fun at things such as being British, bureaucracy, politicians, and other general idiocy, shown through some quite funny situational comedy and some pretty good plain old fashioned word jokes, most of which can raise a chuckle or a wry smile.All of that is in this version too. But I found myself walking out of the film feeling indifferent. I thought the acting was fine; Martin Freeman gave us a new version of Arthur Dent not an adaptation of the Simon Jones TV version. Mos Def started Ford off well, although I felt that the comedy in the character disappeared once the action left the planet earth. Zoey Deschanel gave a nicely ""sensible"" performance of Trillian setting off the the lunacy of Zaphod Beeblebrox. Steven Fry's voice seemed perfect as the narrator and Bill Nighy was definitely a high point.Some of the effects were good, although I felt that there was maybe too much affection for the sort of cheap and cheerful effects which can be found in, just for example, the TV version of the Guide or in Red Dwarf. By that I mean that some of the sets and starships had the style of those originals only done with a really good budget.There are enough of the classic jokes left in for aficionados of the original not to feel that ""all the good bits were left out"" and enough new material so that it didn't feel stale.Well that sounds good so after all that why was I indifferent? It's difficult to point at any one thing. Most of all I think the tongue in cheek irony and throw away jokes that Adams was so good at just don't lend themselves to a big budget movie. It may also be that with such a movie you need a stronger central character to carry you through, but this would be quite contrary to the story which is about the group of characters.So to see it or not? If you're not familiar with the Guide's earlier versions or just don't remember them well, then yes, it's nice to see it updated and I think it will be worth the money, I didn't begrudge my ticket price. If you're a true fan then I have a feeling you'll be let down. Just don't expect the earth to be there.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
357,rogerclementjones,Sorry if you didn't like it!,9,3 May 2005,"I wasn't going to put a comment in about this movie as I thought the responses would be universally (or at least galactically) positive. I was very surprised to see the comments so polarised pro and con.Personally I loved it. What wasn't changed was great, and what was changed was pretty well always for the better. The increase in Trillians part was a good move and made her a little less two dimensional, and the love interest added a necessary positive feel to the story.Like many, I was surprised by some of the casting, but the result worked very well. After seeing the Vogons I'll never look at a Wizard Home Loans ad the same way again.Yes, it's different from the original story, but Douglas Adams kept changing and improving things with each successive medium change, and it's fair enough for him to have continued that change. I suspect that those who didn't like the film felt a bit like the adult who goes to visit a place familiar in childhood and is disappointed because it's not the same as they remembered it (OK, in this case it ISN'T actually the same). But to these moviegoers I say, give it another chance. Go and see it again, but try to leave behind your preconceptions about what it should be like.I won't spoil the climactic scene in the movie for anybody, but I thought it was absolutely classic Adams!

It had top-notch British actors in, so I had high expectations.It was very funny, but the humour was different from that in the book/radio series and lost some of its charm. It lacked the small plot parts which partly made the hitch-hikers guide to the galaxy radio series so enjoyable. Furthermore it added its own plot sections that were not from the book such Martin the Paranoid Andriod dying saving his companions from enemies in a fight.So it is not as charming as the book and the plot goes away from the original story-line too much. However, there are some good parts. The portrayal of the characters was excellent and the characters had the same personality as they did in the book - which gave the film some warmth. And the scenes that *did* stay true to the book were greatI neither recommend nor condemn it.

359,schumybv,Could I BE more disappointed?,2,11 May 2005,"Douglas Adams wrote an amazing book, so funny and clever and with a great twist of events. The movie itself, was kinda funny, did have a twist of events, but it was far from clever. What I liked about the book, was that it was so different than the stereotype of an adventure/sci-fi story, it was so unique. The movie totally ruined that. I mean what was that about the girl being kidnapped and then Arthur going to save her, which by the way was not in the book? And what about that gun they found on Magathea and then the robot using it against the Vogons, or when asked by the mice, Arthur says that the question is, if she's the one? What was up with all that? They ruined a great story and they made it a stereotypical love story, where guy meets girl, guy saves girl, guy ends up with girl at the end, after a series of adventures. Did I miss something, or was there no love story in the book?There were so many things in the movie that were not explained. Like for instance, what is it with Arthur and Ford always caring a towel? Or how did a crazy guy like Zaphod became president of the Galaxy, and what exactly does he do in that position, besides stealing ships? And what about Zaphod's brain that has been messed up with? And what about the fact that Arthur did miss Earth and not think about the girl 24/7?I really do think that is hard to make a movie after a book like this, so I guess the producers do have an excuse. But I do think that if they would've sticked more to the book and less to the stereotypical story, the movie would have been much better.

Between a classic and a clunker,6,30 April 2005,"The hitchhikers guide to the galaxy constantly swereves back and forth from being smart , funny and exciting to convoluted and silly. What stops it from being great all the way through is the weird narrative structure that just wobbles all over the place and characters who are a bit distant from the audience , and are hard to really get behind .This isn't to say that the film is bad. Its definitely entertaining, but the constant flashes of brilliance (wether its a smart explanation of a story element with animated visual aid or just a cool special effect)are accompanied by many bits that just aren't funny and it makes for a slightly uneven viewing experience.Its still worth a look though and it has one of the best opening sequences I've seen all year!",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

ZAP - ""OW""...",9,16 September 2005,"If you were a Guide cultist such as myself, you might dislike this movie for its rather liberal license in interpretation and execution. If you are now or might not ever have been or known about Douglas Adam's 'Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy' you might dislike this movie and its rather rude and insensitive neglect of those who have not indulged. But keep this in mind: It is hilarious. Again, not in the way you might expect - You really have to listen to Arthur to hear what he has to say, but you have to love the guy who, knowing the world is going to end in less than 15 minutes, seems wholly bent on supplying everybody he comes in contact with plenty of beers while rescuing his friend. I loved his entrance.And Trillion was superb - the casting of Marvin simply genius - Slartibartfast a classic. Now, Zaphod - Zaphod, Zaphod, Zaphod - a completely different interpretation altogether. But one which, if you can get over the brashness of them, seems to fit completely with the authors application. My only complaint is the lack of any ""peril sensitive sunglasses"" scene.But I am glad I watched this movie thinking it was going to be a dog - I think the previews did the movie wrong - the lack of any pre-expectations made me enjoy this movie thoroughly.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

The film lacks the sharp satire of the books and the BBC series. . .and the ending! Without giving away the ending of either the BBC series or the movie, let's just say that the absurdity of the BBC series' resolution was one of the most memorable aspects of the series. . .it meant that all of the machinations and drama--of the series and, at least in Douglas' vision, human existence--were essentially absurd.

The TV series was good, but not as good as the radio version or book.But this film stinks. Arthur is not as true to the somewhat bewildered but enduring character of the original, in fact, he could be absent from the film altogether.I have only walked out of 1 film before in my life. I didn't walk out on this one, but I wanted to walk out.Worse, they have established the basis for a sequel. Hopefully if they do that, there will be a better writer and a better cast.

364,wliebold,"Fine, But It Isn't the Original",8,1 May 2005,"This production had a major challenge from the outset: ""Hitchhiker"" was a six (or was it seven) hour BBC radio serial, morphed into three books and a multi-hour BBC TV serial. Some things had to get dropped to produce a 110-minute film. If you have never heard the original radio serial, buy/rent it and listen. You owe it to yourself - if you liked the movie - to hear the original. A concurrent challenge is that this moved from an almost exclusively written work (radio, book) to one where words share the stage with images. Some purists of the original series will have problems with all of this, and my feelings about the film were mixed for these reasons.Entire subplots and characters were dropped along with some classic bits that, again, will be pretty disappointing to purists. A couple of new subplots were added which was also frustrating since original material was dropped to make way for it. The film includes only the first two-thirds (my estimate) of the original radio series and has a much happier ending.There are lots of things the film does very well. Most of the visuals, sets, creatures and costumes are pretty wonderful. The Vogons and Magrathea deserve particular mention. The cast is a delight, with special mention to Zooey Deschanel (who's always a delight) in an expanded version of Trillian. The original ""Marvin"" from the BBC TV series has a cameo, along with Simon Jones (the original Arthur).I will certainly be renting the eventual DVD just to see if there lots of ""deleted scenes.""

365,insult2injury,"Not a direct adaptation, but still fun!",9,30 May 2009,"I thought Disney's version was excellent... very touching and exciting, as well as quite funny... when I saw it in the theater, I thought the pacing was rushed (because I was used to reading the books, listening to the radio plays, and watching the TV series)... however, the more I watch this version, the more I get the flow they were going for... yes, I miss some of the British humor, and I can see how this was tweaked for American audiences... but, I don't think that leaves it totally ""vanilla""... there's still plenty of Adams' quirkiness in there...I am also able to forgive a few minor details that were left out (jokes, lines, bits), and I LOVE the things that we're added (love triangle, Humma, etc.)... I loved the way the Guide animation was presented, and Stephen Fry was top-notch... I especially liked the chemistry between Zooey and Martin, and Sam Rockwell's delivery still makes me laugh out loud (""buttons aren't toys!"")... the Vogons were WAY more impressive and interesting here than in the TV show...I could totally see a sequel, with elements from the book *and* elements from the Disney film melding into a new story arc for the characters...it's unfortunate that this wasn't considered a ""success"" by Hollywood standards, because Disney probably won't take the risk making a sequel...P.S.: I miss Douglas! :-(",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
366,chris543213,a tragedy,2,1 July 2005,"The summary says it all really.I just saw this film with my wife, partly to get her eyes open for Douglas Adams' work (She's never read any of Adams' books, odd as that might seem). In hind sight, this strategy now appears to have been a much flawed one. We essentially left the theatre after one hour to get a meal instead (which proved a wise choice after having just had 60 minutes of our lives stolen).It's very very hard for me to say say bad things about anything related to Adams' works, but this film was a disgrace, completely incoherent and lacking any ounce of humour (for which the books are famous). It's essentially a scene flipping contest with one dull scene followed by the next. Not having seen the last 30 minutes I can't comment on them but unless some miracle happened, like the director gotten sacked and having a new qualified one doing the latter third, I'd say the film is a complete 90 minutes waste of anyone's time, Adams' fans as well anyone else.The sad point is that this filmisation had everything going for it. Great source material, fair to good cast, lots of money, good special effects etc. This can only lead to the conclusion that the blame for managing to, against all odds, deliver a result of this calibre lies squarely with the director.I truly hope the next attempt will receive a captain (director) more suitable to do the material justice, so that Douglas Adams' legacy won't end up entirely lost to the coming generations (and what is left of the remaining one having previously missed out on the gems).",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
367,hedgepuppy,Book to movie - doesn't work well,2,8 May 2005,"This movie simply tried to do too much at once. There are many ""inside jokes"" for people like me who have read all the books in the series, or saw the BBC-TV series, and they are funny in a tittering ""hmmm-hmmm"" kind of way. But beside that, there's not much to be had by them.The main thing most of these reviews have missed is the fact that Douglas Adams' narration and descriptions provided most of the books' humor, not the characters themselves. Arthur Dent in the film would HAVE to be more exciting than the whiny everyman in the books. Zaphod HAD to be over the top in the movie. Marvin HAD to have a famous person's voice. Because these characters, without Adams' descriptions (save the Guide sequences which were hilarious) all have the potential to fall very flat. Even in the BBC-TV version, Zaphod's character pales in comparison to how he is described in the books. There's simply no way to faithfully represent them without the voice of Douglas Adams and his witty descriptions whispering in your ear.As I said already, the Guide was wonderful, and it's no wonder. This is Adams speaking directly to you in the turns of phrases and funny descriptions that made his writing style unique. Stephen Fry's voice, combined with some wonderful animation, provided most of the film's humor. The BBC-TV series, however, did a better job with them, because the camera stuck with them throughout their descriptions. The entire Vogon poetry segment in the film, as described by the Guide, was completely botched because people aren't listening to the Guide AND watching the Vogon poetry at the same time. So the Guide and its funniest bit is primarily lost. All in all, we needed MANY more intrusions from the Guide throughout the movie.Is the Hitchhiker series inevitably unfilmable? Sadly, I think so. And I think the roller-coaster ride of trying to get this film made, with so many directors leaving the project, is evidence of that. Garth Jennings tried to do a lot, but it ended up being a mess, with or without the plot changes to make the story into a screenplay.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

However there are many problems with this that make it not a patch on the original classic upon which it is loosely based.1. The whole extra section of Trillian's capture and rescue was extraneous and irrelevant to the plot. About half an hour was wasted on time that could have been spent on classic scenes which were instead cut to make space for this dross.2. All, not just some, but all of the classic lines were either cut or delivered so badly that they just weren't funny.3. To call the characters ""flat"" is to waste a perfect opportunity to use the word ""insipid"". Douglas Adams created full rich characters with depth, pathos and humour. In this creation, I think the best performance comes from the bowl of petunias.4. Acting, uh was there any? It comes across to me as reminiscent of a very bad '70s sitcom level. And not funny.5. Every single joke, example of irony and subtlety became brash and outlandish. Totally ""in your face"" and lacking the style of the original utterly.All in all, if you've read this far, save your money and do *not* go to see this movie.Oh, and if you're wondering what that loud humming noise in the background is, it's the spinning of Douglas Adams turning in his grave.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
370,grimdodger,"Departs from the book, but still pretty fine",10,29 April 2005,"I just watched the movie, and honestly I was feeling bad because obviously I missed all those previews and test screenings but everyone else had seen them, and made different comments about how bad the movie was. And why? Because the content was totally different from the book..When there is an adaptation at hand, not just a book but a comic, a song, a TV series, or the Holy Bible, there has to be some changes. Change is inevitable. And whenever there is a change, there will be people stating their initial reactions about the change: it sucks.. This is not an emotion, but a programmed reaction to any kind of change.For Hitchhiker's Guide to Galaxy, I always wondered how it can be fitted into a 1.5 hour movie without losing the structure. It never occurred as the meaning of life popped into the mind of Fenchurch. there had to be something trimmed.Karey Kirkpatrick? Who the hell he was? I guess that was my reaction when I first heard of the production. A little jealous obviously, which made me think ""Oh, he will blow it up"" And as the release date approached, I started hearing more comments on how the movie was totally different then the radio series, the book, the BBC TV series, the comics, the towel..And finally, when the movie started with a quote from the middle of the book, I didn't feel mad. I liked it. And throughout the movie it was a nice mix of the story that readers of the book knew already. Furthermore, it was an appropriate way to tell the story of Arthur Dent to those who didn't read the books.Casting was great. Freeman makes a good Dent, he is not on the spotlight unfortunately. Mos Def is promising; he had some eeriness of Ford Prefect, but not entirely. He was funny in most occasions. Rockwell rocked as Zaphod, Deschanel was cute but nothing more was available to express her talent, Bill Nighy was beyond words as Slartibartfast; what a render! And last but not least Alan Rickman's voice fitted perfectly, damn we love that guy don't we? And did you notice John Malkovich? I didn't. Perhaps because we don't see him in the movies anymore. Sad.Imagery was great. Concepts, designs, planets, and of course the Earth-2 scenes were beautiful. The thing with the dolphins in the beginning was sweet.Story was.. well you know it's good. Changes were kind of disturbing but still bearable. Humma Kavula thing was obviously added by Adams himself, the love story between Arthur and Trillian was brain scratching but on the other hand didn't we always felt bad for Arthur losing Tricia to Zaphod? Here, he gets his revenge. So, another hurray. Actually story was cut, after the escape of Arthur's brain, to a happy ending. It was sweet, but I would like to see the restaurant at the end of the universe too.To sum up: I think movie was funny. Even though many of Adams' cunning jokes were ""polished"" one cannot argue with that since movie goers don't have the dominating percentage of high IQ. I believe movie was conducted nicely to introduce a great novel to those who wouldn't read it in a million years. I enjoyed it, and I seriously don't believe that Douglas Adams had something else in his mind when he wrote the HHGG: make people enjoy.

I should start off by saying that I have read the books and this movie by no means stays completely true them plot wise, but that being said it certainly captures the humour and spirit. Martin Freeman is absolutely perfect as Arthur Dent. He embodies the baffled Englishman who just wants a cup of tea. Mos Def and Zooey Deshanel are both very good as well, but the guy who seems to be having the time of his life is Sam Rockwell as Zaphod. He is so funny; he steals every scene that he's in. Also worth mentioning are Bill Nighy as Slartibartfast and Alan Rickman as the voice of Marvin the perpetually depressed robot.If it seems that this is something you can only enter into if you have knowledge of the Douglas Adams universe, don't panic.

Movies are not books or TV they need to be short and punchy which makes some of the adventures not found in the original a bit lame. I presumed they weren't written by Douglas Adams but it turns out that the producers claim they are. Adams' writing is funny because it sublime and gently but it seems he or the producers were going for the in your face laughs a short movie demands. In the ideal world they would have taken their time and made three or four sequels allowing Adams' unique and fabulous humour to get the recognition from a new audience.

Frankly had I been in her position I may have done the same. It is extremely difficult to follow and many things seem to happen for no reason. The acting is mediocre and Sam Rockwell just doesn't work as Zaphod (don't know why - on paper it looks like a lock). The quirky humor of the book comes through only in patches - I don't know why but I also had difficulty hearing some of the lines (especially the Vogons). FX were average.

Even though in London there they have Lenny Henry and they have Don Cheadle and they have Lennox Lewis, still, County Surrey (in which at least the Earth's part of the story is to take place) is sort of a place in which blacks don't come natural. Why is this important? Because Hitch-Hiker's Guide is not about traveling in space and it is not about meeting aliens. It is not about shooting ray guns nor is it about time travel. It is about being English, and nothing else. Seeing a US gangsta rapper playing Ford Prefect immediately indicates, that the British thoughts behind it have been americanized (basically, not grasped, that is). That's why I knew it HAD gone wrong.What I saw, though, introduced a whole new meaning of the word 'wrong'. Pretty much every cool thought of the Hitch-Hiker's Guide books was minced into some please-everyone-who's-IQ-resembles-the-room-temperature kind of fashion with the result of pretty much nothing funny at all.I recommend not to watch this movie by any means. It ain't worth nor time nor money.However, it sported two and a half good things: the introductory Music's Banjo theme reminded me of something - and (yes!) it was the reprise of BBC's Hitch-Hiker's Guide TV series' main title. Secondly the original Marvin from the TV-series was reactivated for a cameo in the scene where the protagonists queue in some Vogon public office.

The romance between Arthur and Trillian is terrible, (that girl is the worst actress ever), and this film is for fans alone, who want to have their hearts broken. Avoid this, unless you want to have your heart broken. Mos Def looks sop bored, and spends most of the film looking like he has no idea how he ended up in this stink hole.

380,Lupin003,HIGHLY enjoyable despite 20+ years of expectations,10,29 April 2005,"It's sad to realize that the daunting task of adapting Douglas Noel Adams ""The Hitchhikers Guide To The Galaxy"" to the realm of the cinema was as difficult and challenging in 20+ years as Arthur Dent finding a good cup of tea in the ""mind bogglingly big"" reaches of space outside of earth.Additionally sadly, this task was not achieved until after the passing of DNA.Thankfully, in my humble opinion as a fan of The Hitchhikers BBC Radio series (and all it's adaptations...book, television, comic book, photographic novel, text-based video game) what we've ended up with, is a treatment by Mr. Adams, that is, I can't help but feeling, directed with the intention not only of pleasing your STANDARD Movie-going AUDIENCE (let's face it, at the end of the day, they're who the studios are thinking of) but also being both highly referential to the various incarnations of the HH legacy (read: in-jokes for the fans, background items for the background watchers, and actors like Stephen Fry and Simon Jones who can easily be recognized as a part of that HH legacy.) AND highly respectful of Adams' wit, pacing, style of writing, and the man himself.SPOILERS BELOW (lay on the ground and put a bag over your head.) Okay, now, for the purists. The ending is different than the book. (Earth Mark II is not restarted in a caveman-era and populated by the wayward Golgolfrinchians.) What does this mean to both the standard HH fanatic? Outrage? Possibly. (Thankfully NOT in my case...seeing as how, if DNA taught me anything, it's that holding on to things that really aren't very important in the SMALL scope of things ... say, a movie ending ... isn't really what we should be looking to do when there's a world in a constant state of flux and a universe so vast that we can't possibly even imagine how big it is without risking our brains exploding in our skulls.) For those who find themselves disheartened by the fact that Earth is ""reset"" by Slartibart fast and ""set right back the way it was""....you MUST keep in mind that the realm of the cinema is not one in which fans of work as rich, thought provoking, important, or FUNNY as HHGTTG receive EXACTING treatments meant to please us and ONLY us. The ending was obviously designed (perhaps by DNA in his original treatment...perhaps by director Garth Jennings to leave audience members NOT familiar with the plight of Arthur Dent (other than the 2 hours they just spent with him) feeling halfway decent about the fate of our wayward galactic traveler. It's that old studio paradigm that you have to let the audience go away happy. (Sad but true) And, for die-hard fans of all things Adams who were OKAY with the ending, perhaps it's because we get to see a development within Arthur, that you really don't get to see, perhaps at all in the course of 5 books....Arthur being OKAY with moving on. Is that a bastardization of his character? SHOULD Arthur Dent ONLY be a nervous, unsure, stuttering, bookish, wallflower who never really grows, even though he figures out the ""Ultimate Question"", learns how to fly, and meets his own daughter from an alternate reality??? I wouldn't be unhappy if that was the note that Jennings ended the film version of HHG on....but it wasn't. And fortunately, the minor (okay, MAJOR) modification has left me feeling surprisingly refreshed. Arthur making a choice about his future in the galaxy is a good thing.Hopefully audiences make a choice to go back and see this one again and again, and buy all of the bonus special edition DVD's....so Disney will continue our beloved series down it's galactic road.I give it an 8 out of 10 for the purpose of this review for being HIGHLY respectful to the source material and the memory of DNA, as well as visually brilliant, frantic, and wittily entertaining for a standard viewing audience.-Frank Viturello",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
381,sbwoodside,The movie's fundamental flaws are completely hidden by its superficial flaws,5,1 February 2009,"This movie is superficially exciting but also superficially ... well ... superficial. It doesn't deliver on the fundamental Douglas Adams promise. We want a good hard laugh at life, but we get some kind of romp/love story. And while it's vaguely entertaining, it just doesn't pull through on the source material. In order to understand why the movie fails, we must first understand what underlying drives the originals. What is the actual story and how did Douglas Adams develop it?The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy in original form is about life, the universe, and everything, ... and the fact that it makes no sense. Life makes no sense. Nothing that happens makes any sense. There is no purpose, to meaning, no answer, just an endless series of coincidences, catastrophes, and occasionally good times which we just have to put up with until we die. This is the thesis of HHGTTG, and also a good bit of Douglas's other work.He develops his story through the Guide. The Guide is the voice of the narrator, who spends most of his time talking about a book, ""that most famous of all books to come out of the great publishing houses of Ursa Minor Beta"", and which the narrator notes on the FIRST PAGE of the novel, is the subject of the whole story in the first place. Not a person, a book! Arthur is just a new reader of the book, Ford is just an old writer for the book, and the other characters just embody the book's general philosophy: that the universe is fscked up (Marvin), and you might as well just try to have fun (Zaphod).As characters, Douglas didn't develop them much. All of them had essentially zero control over their own lives, even when they thought they did. Trillian and Ford seemed to have wilfully chosen to just hang on for the ride, and Zaphod seemed to be doing the bidding of some kind of voices that only he can hear. Even the hyper-intelligent trans-dimensional aliens couldn't figure out what to make the answer to the Ultimate Question, or prevent a bunch of bungling bureaucrats from messing up their shot at obtaining the Question. I'm not trying to belabour Douglas' original plot here, just point out that it makes sense only if you realize that Douglas is trying to tell you that it doesn't make any sense at all. The Big It. Everything. Nothing Makes Sense.It's like that moment in the Simpson's when the lawyer invokes the Chewbacca Defence. It doesn't make sense. It just doesn't make sense. THAT is what the Hitch Hiker's Guide is all about.So you can't shoehorn that into a movie about romance and character development and happy endings. All of the best material, what Douglas created, is the ultimate joke of the pointless randomness of life. And that's not only what Douglas' story is about, but what the book inside the story is about. That's why the backbone of any good retelling of the story must make the book itself the central fixture and the backbone of the narrative. Keep as much of Douglas's precisely crafted dialogue in place as possible, and don't worry too much about plot or character development. Make sure that when the audience finds out that the answer, after all that time, searching, questing, is 42, that they laugh in the knowledge that it doesn't make any sense, and it doesn't have to, and they'll feel better if they don't worry about it and just go along for the ride.The 1980s miniseries accomplished this in it's own low-budget (and let not mince words, poorly directed) fashion. And maybe, after the early demise of the author, in a fashion so pointlessly meaningless that he ought to have written it himself, we'll eventually get movie that helps us all feel a bit better about losing him so early.And if you're reading this in the future: can you send it back through a time warp?",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
382,anton-79,"Some good elements, but also somewhat boring",5,15 June 2005,"What I liked about this film were the visual elements, from the forms of various things (e.g., the spaceships and the missiles chasing it, Deep Thought, Marvin and the Vogons), the effects of the space drive, the design and effects of the Guide, how the action of the Vogon fleet is shown, the planet construction yard.I also liked the portrayal of Zaphod Beeblebrox, and some of the jokes.However, in some parts of the film I felt bored, and I was thinking how long it is going to drag on. I am not sure why, but maybe a weak story is more of a problem in a film than a book, or maybe the book made up for it in other ways that the film did not.It also seems to me that some of the jokes were cut short (to their detriment), e.g., the location of the plans for the bypass.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
383,Canvoodoo,Vastly inferior to the 1981 Television version,1,10 February 2006,"I just saw this last night. I'm glad I borrowed from my local library -- it was worth exactly what I paid for it (nothing). I'm also glad that I >didn't< try to watch this on a Trans-Atlantic flight last year -- it would have made the eight hour flight seem longer still. Normally, I wouldn't have wasted two hours of waking time on something this worthless, but after the first 20 minutes (enough to see just how badly it was turning out), I had to keep watching, just to see how awful it could be. I watched right to the end, and the answer is: Very awful indeed.The movie's pedigree should be impeccable, given the successful history of adapting the original Douglas Adams radio series into other media (books, audio recordings, a stage play, television, a computer game). The film has multiple well-known actors, and the advent of CGI should make some of the more challenging flights of fancy from the radio program relatively easy to get across. So what happened? Douglas Adams is co-credited with the screenplay, and a lot of his words do survive in the finished product. But it has been edited in a ham-fisted fashion to rob the impact from many of the jokes (why?), marvelously funny stuff has been removed, and painfully unfunny stuff inserted in its place, leaving an incoherent mess. (M. J. Simpson goes into this in far more detail in his review on www.planetmagrathea.com). To be fair, some of the stuff that was inserted was written by Adams before he died  I can only hope that these were unfinished drafts, and that Adams himself would have been able come up with a better finished product. (Adams was infamous for finding it almost impossible to finish work without a gun to his head, so this isn't at all improbable). It probably isn't a coincidence that this movie was in and out of 'Development Hell' for over 20 years while Douglas was alive, and only got into production after he was no longer around. I would like to think that he would have thought better of his creation, and would have objected to what ended up in the screen version.The 1981 Television version, with perhaps 2 % of the movie's budget, did a superior job - not perfect, but a far better reflection of the spirit of the radio original. It didn't have much in the way of expensive special effects, but the acting in that version was (mostly) appropriate for the characters as written. For the most part, I found the main characters in the movie either unconvincing and/or annoying. It isn't just that they're acted by different performers  some of the roles were changed between the radio and television versions without destroying the quality. The one instance of casting that seems to work is Bill Nighy's Slartibartfast  very different from Richard Vernon in the radio/TV version, but still appropriate and enjoyable to watch. His sequences were about the only part of the movie that I felt had any virtue at all.In the television version, the sections featuring the guide (done using clever conventional animation, as computer animation wasn't up to the task back then) were the highlight of the whole program -- very well executed, chock full of humour, and they stand up well to repeat viewing 25 years later. In the movie, the actual guide is far less present, and what is there is flat and uninteresting for the most part. Unfortunately, the two different versions of Hitchhiker's illustrate two extremes of the role of special effects in movies/television. Just as low budget special effects didn't stop the television version from being entertaining, high budget special effects (which are ubiquitous in the movie) can't make it entertaining by themselves. Special effects are secondary, a means rather than an end.I also wonder about the cutting of one of the better known parts of the radio original -- the ""nonexistance of god"" speech. My immediate assumption is that this was left out to prevent controversy in the United States. This may have been a mistake -- Possibly, if the speech had been included, it might have sparked a big controversy, and got a lot of people out to the cinema to see what all the fuss was about. Properly managed, it could have been a free publicity bonanza!Incidentally, the movie leaves an obvious hook for a sequel. I sincerely hope that this never occurs (at least not by the crew that produced this...).To the viewers who watched this movie, and can't understand what all the fuss about the Hitchhikers's Guide is all about  go find the guide in one of its other incarnations. Listen to the radio series (available on CD), watch the TV series (available on DVD), or read the books (the first three, at least). I think you will find that what you encounter will be far more entertaining and worthy of your time.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
384,flamingobill,Too frenetic to be funny,4,8 January 2006,"I found the film to be obnoxious. Apparently fast and incoherent is funny. I felt it needed more room to breathe. The lines were often mumbled, the plot zoomed by as if the film was being fast-forwarded, and very few jokes were given the pacing to be funny. The film often distanced itself from the action, and situations that would have been funny, given closer angles, weren't because of stale uses of wide (very wide) static shots. I got the impression that the film was being directed like a music video rather than a comedic feature-length film.On the plus side, the actor's are well cast, and the condensed script had potential to work under the right direction.However, I say all this because I'm not used to films being done this way. In the day and age of music videos where shots are getting shorter and shorter, this fast pace might work perfectly to the accustomed and younger crowd, in which case there isn't a problem with the direction, and the film is just fine and dandy.PS. I've read the book, watched the mini-series, and listened to the audio tapes.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
385,krankcolc,brilliant... for most,9,23 April 2005,"For those whom have read the book(s), you will love this movie. Not because it's just like the book, but because it is just as entertaining and insane and outrageous. And it's probably not anything that you would have expected or pictured when reading the book. It's better.Amazingly, it was not defiled by Hollywood like most great books are. It's crammed into 110 minutes, but it is probably the most odd, random and ridiculously funny 110 minutes of the year.The cast is almost perfect. Mos Def is a better choice than i would of expected, Sam Rockwell is great (as usual), and I can't see anyone else better to play Arthur than Martin Freeman now that I have seen the film. Oh yeah, the 3 second cameo from Jason Schwartzman is superb.I wasn't sure if folks whom haven't read the book would enjoy it as much, but I'm sure they did from the amount of uncontrolled laughter they emitted frequently at the screening.Well done chaps.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
386,kainaw,A movie that knows exactly where its towel is.,10,29 April 2005,"I first heard that Douglas Adams' radio show and novel was going to become a movie in 1984. Shortly afterward, I heard that the team chosen to make the movie had come up with a better script (Ghostbusters), so it would be a couple years before we could see The Hithhiker Movie. Those couple years apparently went off on holiday and stretched out to 20.Waiting though my adolescence, military service, courtship, marriage, job, unemployment, college, and yet another job, I built up a bit of anticipation for the final product. I couldn't wait one day more. I called in sick to work and went right out to the theater on opening day.When it comes down to it, the Hitchhiker stories are more than a bit silly. It does make some clearly sane observations about humanity: The function of the President is not to wield power, but to distract attention away from those who are truly in power. All in all though, it is a silly story of characters and events that you wouldn't believe even if there were a Vogon fleet a mere light-year away and closing in fast. That is, you wouldn't believe it unless there was also an Infinite Improbability Drive in the mix to make sense of anything that doesn't make any sense at all.I deeply feared that the cast and crew would attempt to be serious. Imagine Monty Python performing Shakespeare with coconuts and funny walks - reverse that. I simply felt that a movie that was too serious would be a disappointment to the fans and turn the newcomers away. So, I was overwhelmed to be introduced by a silly song sung (telepathically) by dolphins, ""So Long and Thanks For All The Fish.""It appears that I've neared my 1,000 word limit and I'm just getting to the movie.As I walked out of the theater, I pulled my ticket stub out of my pocket to write my review while it was still clear in my mind: Excellent. Now, after digesting it a bit. Ford was a bit hard to follow. Trillian's eyes kept making me forget to pay attention to the film. Marvin and the Vogons were excellent, but I didn't much care for the babel fish. With that in mind, I've decided to revise my review: Mostly Excellent.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
387,TheBogieFan,Disappointing as nothing really happens,6,8 May 2005,"When i saw that this film had finally been finished after years (decades?) of rumours i was really looking forward to seeing it. I'd seen the BBCTV series when i was a kid, i'd read the books when i was a student, i'd bought the radio series CDs when i was in my mid-late 20s, now at 30 i was ready for a new interpretation of The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy.I liked the way the film started with the party where Arthur Dent met Trillian and Zaphod, a nice touch. I also liked the casting of the guy who played Tim in the office as Dent, seemed a good choice. Several other good comedy people in there - The League Of Gentlemen and notably Stephen Fry as the book being particular favourites of mine. There were a few interesting deviations from what we'd had before (either that or i'd forgotten them), i loved The Whales' ""So long and thanks for all the fish"" segment.My main problem with the film was that nothing really happened, it's pretty clear that they are intending to do more films going by the fact that this film only has about 20% of the storyline in it. Sadly, i saw it on the second week of release at the late Saturday night showing at a popular multiplex in Leeds and there were barely 2 dozen people present which if representative suggests there won't be any sequels.Anyway, one highlight is the actress who plays Trillian, she is truly gorgeous and is welcome relief after Sandra Dickinson's squeaky tones on the BBC series - she actually bears a passing resemblance to Mindy from Mork & Mindy to these eyes. As with LOTR and its overemphasis of the Arwen/Aragorn relationship it seems that this film plays heavily with the Trillian/Dent angle - not really a criticism but maybe that's what film screenplays need these days? Maybe they want more than just SF/comedy fans to watch....I wouldn't say this is a bad film or even a bad adaptation but if the sequels don't happen then it will be about as much good as the animated Lord Of The Rings that stops part way through Two Towers. If that happens then the BBC TV series and Radio Series (and the books) will be the definitive Hitchhiker's and this will just be an interesting aside.(Apologies for mentioning LOTR twice in this review, but i thought there were parallels to be drawn)",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
388,jcr22,A major disappointment,5,28 April 2005,"Bah, there I was sitting in the cinema watching the incredible opening sequence of hitchhikers guide thinking 'my goodness, they've pulled it off'.But they haven't. Visually it's stunning, but they've tried to fit far too much in, they've thrown idea after idea at the screen in the hope something sticks- it's totally scattershot (example- Malkovich's character is made to seem important but he's in it for about 2 minutes before the film moves on to something else). They should have kept more of the source material, slowed the pace down and let the humour breathe. The acting is good although Freeman pales next to Simon Jones (dent in the TV series), and is not helped when the latter turns up for a cameo. And the improbability drive has been reduced to a useful button to press to get rid of plot holes.I feel bad about not liking this given it's this sort of thing that's going to have to save the movies from the likes of XXX 2, but it's difficult to see who this will appeal to. Die hards won't like the changes (worst crime- the guides 'mostly harmless' description of earth is omitted) and I suspect it's going to go over most other folk's heads.

I am perfectly aware that radio, television, books and movies are totally different media, with different narrative and technical requirements. But after watching this movie, I have come to the educated opinion that it is utter, utter, utter rubbish.Douglas Adams was one of the funniest writers on the planet. The radio series was hilarious, the TV series was funny, the book was inspired comic genius. But the movie? Mildly amusing only.What a pity. What a waste. It could have been so good.

I was laughing so hard at times that my stomach acked. The vogons, seen as the bureaucratic species, where great, just as they were described in the book. The cast did great job here, Mos Def as Ford Prefect was my favorite character, a bit crazy but not to much.

391,rickmeister,Mostly Harmless?,6,2 May 2005,"The original TV series from the 80s was pretty surreal, but this didn't quite prepare me for the extravaganza of the frenetic, zany, sometimes bizarre, plot that was laid before the audience. And it works ... mostly.The start of the film was really well paced and the opening Dolphin song 'So Long and Thanks for All the Fish' was at once completely different from the tone of the TV series and refreshingly new and inventive. I was really hoping that this was going to continue and for the first half hour or so, it did not disappoint and was a great start. But then it might have been difficult to mess up such a classic start as you are given in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (H2G2). It is after all the End of The World as we know it ...The Guide - voiced by Stephen Fry - was as good as the original if not better, with the right balance of whimsical informativeness and gentle humour. Martin Freeman as Arthur Dent was a great bit of casting and despite throwing away a couple of the original one-liners he really came to his own where the film started to chart new territory. Zaphod you'll either love or hate, but Sam Rockwell gave a fine 'zany-nutso' performance. Mos Def even managed to pull off a decent Ford Prefect and Zooey Deschannel was completely convincing as a rather sassy Trillian. I have to say Bill Nighy, although playing largely the same character as he usually does, was superb as Slartibartfast and gave the character extra-dimensions with his earnest willingness to please. Alan Rickman's Marvin the Paranoid Android was also similarly re-invented (BTW - fans of the TV series will no doubt spot the original Paranoid Android in one scene)Unfortunately the Guide's graphics were a little disappointing, as the originals had been so ground-breaking, but still had plenty of humour. The Vogons were really well executed and really gave some extra 'slimeyness' to their role, and the sfx in Magrathea's 'Factory Floor' were spectacular.For me however the film started to go wrong when they went to Vogsphere. Now, it may have seemed from the above that I may be a bit hung up on the original TV series ... BUT I'd agree that the books / TV Series / Radio series were all quite flawed and other than the great beginning, all of them have great moments and then patchy or quirky plot twists that you either love or hate. What it felt like to me however, was that it was a kind of pastiche of a Terry Gilliam world, and an alternative, more upbeat script with more prominent love-story, lots of 'zany' or 'wacky' antics and a happy ending. Even Marvin's manic-depressive epigrams seemed more upbeat. And I guess that's the point really. Some of the bleakness and pointlessness of existence is lost, and I feel that was really Douglas Adams' strength - in portraying these facets of existence in a surreal and humorous way. It's definitely worth seeing, if nothing else for the first half an hour and the frankly superb Dolphin 'Song and Dance' routine, but it's not great. It won't offend old fans or people who know nothing about H2G2, but in the words of the great Guide itself ... it's Mostly Harmless.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
392,lazylaurablue,Mostly Harmless,6,8 October 2005,"Unlike some others, I was not impressed at all with the dolphin song at the beginning, as I felt this kind of pseudo-Broadway enthusiasm was out of place in something so out of the ordinary as Hitch Hikers' Guide.I never liked the British TV series; in part this was because of the restrictions that visuals place upon the imagination, and in part this was because Zaphod's polystyrene second head never worked for me. I was gratified therefore to see that the head issue was dealt with in a more tasteful (if even less believable) manner, and the arm was really quite wittily introduced but never really exaggerated (which was a good thing). Nice touch too, I think, that the whale's introduction to life was dubbed with the original from the radio series. At least, I'd lay money that it was.I didn't like Ford Prefect much, although he was okay. I much preferred the Trillian in this to the Trillian played by Sandra Dickenson in the TV series, as the book clearly states she is a brunette. Much, much, better, once I'd got over the accent (sorry, but I got very used to Susan Sherridan's Trillian before I ever saw a screen version, and I will never get used to the idea of Trillian being an American).I liked the Zaphod in the film much better too. He was so much more convincing than the TV version, although I wouldn't call him the worst dressed sentient being because I know people who dress MUCH worse than that! Still, he was good. Even the changes in storyline were okay, fairly seamless, and of course Freeman is good, although possibly lacks the complete anal uptightness that for me characterises a really realistic Aurther Dent. But I suppose he needed to tone that down, to make one of the other changes in plot believable...I didn't like the Vogons much, but then again who does? And did the spiteful female have to have a British accent yet again? Let's just say, you can tell this film is hugely influenced by the US... Even so, it has managed to retain a lot of the humour and is definitely worth seeing, even for the purist. I enjoyed it (and I'm purist enough to know that the the original writer of the worst poetry ever written was, in fact, a man; I think he had a sex change for legal reasons. Besides, there's a lot of that goes on in the BBC anyway...)",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
393,judasfm,"Fair, but disappointing",5,1 May 2012,"There are some really high points in this adaptation, and their names are Martin Freeman (Arthur Dent) Alan Rickman (voice of Marvin) and Bill Nighy (Slartibartfast). And let's face it, everyone knows those three are fantastic.The film draws enough from the books to satisfy fans, and the song So Long (And Thanks For All The Fish) was brilliant.However, Ford Prefect was a little annoying, although just about watchable. The thing about Zaphod's extra 'face' being under his regular one and his third arm being secret is, however, ludicrous. The actor was fantastic in the role; it's just a shame that the above changes to his character prevented me from really enjoying his performance.Zooey is a good actress, however I felt she was completely wrong for Trillian and I find her presence ruins whatever scene she happens to be in. Again, let me stress that Zooey herself is a good actress; she's just completely wrong for this part, and that's the problem with this version of Trillian and Ford. Both are played by very good performers; unfortunately they're also played by completely the wrong performers.There are some other good things - the scene with Arthur and Ford and the babel fish, and the little touches such as the crab that the Vogon smashes (you really do need to be a die-hard fan of the book or radio play to get that reference!) and, of course, the Vogons themselves are fantastically designed - and it's those things and the performance of the other three actors who were perfectly cast which garner it 5/10 from me, if only because 5.5 isn't available as a rating.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
394,SpiralWire,"Visually Brilliant, but lacking an essence",5,17 May 2005,"Well, your view on HGTG will vary considerably depending on whether you are a fan of the TV series of 1981. I myself am so, and thus the film was a disappointment. Despite having one of the most humorous beginnings to any film, I feel that the main problem is that there was simply too much to pack in to a limited screen time. As such, two problems arose. Firstly, everything seemed a little rushed, and I'd imagine that if you weren't already familiar with certain dialogue and concepts (such as how the improbability drive works) you might be a little confused. Some dialogue in fact, is bearly comprehensible and this is particularly harmful in the initial scenes outside Arthur's house. Secondly, the plot had to be altered so that it fit into a film, and sadly this made it lose a certain something. The original story, a far slower and more coherent one, is far, far different than what is presented here. The original story hinges on the answer given by a powerful computer for the ultimate question of life being 42. Whilst this is dealt with, it is poorly presented and I can see it being very easy to misunderstand.Another problem is the characters. Ford Prefect, played by Mos Def is, I feel, totally miscast and as such sinks into the background. If anyone remembers the original Ford Prefect, who was quirky yet authoritative, you may know what I mean - Mos Def carries no weight about him. In general, since this is a British story, there aren't quite enough British accents. While Sam Rockwell's performance as Zaphod Beeblebrox is spot on as Southern American, the role of Ford Prefect really should be with a British accent.The best part of the film is some of the truly wonderful imagery. The destruction of Earth is an horrific and subtley handled scene which is utterly brilliant. As is the planet factory - a solar-system-sized 'factory floor' where the construction of several planets can be seen. I've never seen anything quite like it.That said, the film unfortunately doesn't present Douglas Adams' story to its full and wonderful potential, but relies too much on hyperactivity and playfulness. It just moves too fast.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
395,darketernal,"Whimsical, droll, amusing, amazing",8,28 December 2005,"There seems to be two kinds of mentalities towards this movie. It's either love the silly, nonsensical humor and take all the jokes in stride, or just disregard it as not worth the time or maybe something just for the fans of the book series. I am firmly of the former, having read, and loved, the whole series of Douglas Adams' ""Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"".The book was full of this kind of whimsical humor which translated into a very funny book. The film, being, for the most part anyways, a direct translation of the book, keeps this sense and even plays on it a little bit. The added parts are very well done and usually keep pace with the movie, though there are a few parts that are out of place. The visual effects do the books proud and really add to the experience of reading the book.Overall, as a fan of Douglas Adams, I was very pleased after seeing this.

397,Aiders,Don't understand their cutting choices...,6,30 April 2005,"**non-spoiler part** Let me preface this by saying I thought I was a huge fan of HHGG. Read the trilogy (of 5) many many times, watched the show, and had the 1st 3 books on tape which I wore out...twice.But I guess I'm not a fan, because I wasn't even aware this book had been made into a film until yesterday.Just saw it today, and like the many reviews here my feelings are mixed.I actually wasn't a huge fan of the TV series, I thought it paled next to the book. The movie actually impressed me more, but why why oh why did they want to invent things at the cost of leaving things out?**spoiler-ish part**The casting of the primaries is pretty solid, and I thought Zaphod, although not as cool as he should have been was well played by Rockwell. Mos Def was a capable, if underplayed Prefect. Freeman captures the essence of Arthur Dent fairly well, but ends up (through no fault of his own) having to play a completely different Arthur than Adams' original. Zooeey Daschanel is also a decent Trillian, but her character remains undeveloped. Rickman, who I dearly love, plays Rickman not Marvin, and the Paranoid Android ends up being a truculent sarcastic character instead of the hopelessly depressed Mechanoid Adams captured so brilliantly. (Why oh why didn't they get Stephen Moore who did the original in the TV, radio, and read the audio book. I hope he didn't die).The effects are spot on, and many of the production elements work great. Just don't understand why they added 10-15 mins of stuff not in the book and had to leave out stuff that without it, just makes it Hitchhiker's Guide to the Ga.5 minutes longer in the first portion would have allowed them to have Prosser lie in front of the bulldozer, would have allowed for a less rushed ""getting to know your friend isn't from Guildford"", allowed the Hyperspace jump - unpleasantly like being drunk. +some of the great banter in the Vogon Hold. 4 mins more would have explained that Zaphod was going to discover Magrathea, the planet that MADE planets that Ford insists was a Children's Story. Plus would have allowed for Arthur teaching the Computer how to make tea. And throw in the joke with ""I seem to have terrible trouble with my lifestyle"" while on the surface. The detour to meet Malkovich's character, Trillian's rescue were totally unnecessary and not especially funny... I'm thinking that DNA may have actually written it and that was why it was included (but shouldn't have bothered).**end of spoilers**As a finished product, the movie is not bad at all, its just average, what I think the negative reviews are from is the frustration from those fans who know what was missed as an opportunity.For any fan of the book, expect some rocky parts of the movie... but stick out through the middle, and enjoy the beginning and end... you may need to exercise some forgiveness for some of the licenses Hollywood has to take to sew up the loose ends that would be a hard sell to a producer.

It suffers from comparison to a) The Radio Play, which it was originally, b) The Book, c) The Television Series, and d) The Game. I have spent far too much of my life immersed in any one of these, and although each prepared me for the changes (none were copies of the other), the movie suffered from over 20 years of images solidified in my brain by overexposure. Simon Jones will always be Arthur Dent to me, although I really liked the new Zaphod Beeblebrox. Mos Def was a great and creative choice for Ford and the new Trillian r0x0rs. But the movie was damned by its predecessors, and unless they had come up with some really nasty and acerbic observations about humanity that the previous incarnations hadn't, well, zark it all, I'll be belgiumed if I know what to do about it.

399,rolinmoe,I'm So Depressed,3,1 May 2005,"For anyone well-versed in the HHGG trade, this movie can only come as a disappointment. At the outset, it is masterful; an incredible teaser, Stephen Fry reading as the Guide quite well, and a great musical number to get us to the story. From there, a hodgepodge of disaster that only stops once the lights come on, the stark realization that your heroes are no more. Hollywood has taken Douglas Adams' brilliant machinations and smudged them into 110 minutes of formulaic story, centered around convenience for those poor souls forced to emulate Adams.The movie does several things better than the BBC version: better camera, wonderful computer graphics, quality sound, and a spirited performance from Bill Nighy as Slartibartfast. Alan Rickman give a great effort as Marvin the Paranoid Android, although the new lines he is written do nothing for him as a character. That aside, this movie sorely lacks the wit and nuance of the Adams franchise, instead rife with the acrid stench of stereotype.Sour grapes from someone who can't let go of HHGG and let it see mainstream acclaim? Sure, there are a dozen or so of the great dry jokes left, which get the best laughs in the place. So why not put more in? Why turn the sad-luck Arthur Dent into a complete dolt, who I cannot imagine cheering for at the end? All the main cast is flat, each playing one-dimension, those dimensions dying out much sooner than the filmmakers hoped. Some of it is poor casting, much of it is poor writing to help along the Hollywood plot. As the movie wears on, it becomes less Adams and more focus group, giving the audience a visual dose of the Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster.This movie also includes a device that is, without a doubt, the most obvious writer's convenience ever to hit the silver screen.Bittersweet. I wish to tell all HHGG fans to see this film, revel in the culmination of what Adams wrought. However, this is no work of the Douglas Adams I grew up reading. If you want to see life from Adams' perspective, get a good towel to lie on as you place a paper bag on your head. Seeing this flick will make you feel more like Marvin than anything.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
400,nikki-folwell,The special effects were impressive. That's about it.,2,9 November 2008,"You know you've got a bad movie when the best actor in it is the robot.I admit I was looking forward to seeing this film after I found out that Martin Freeman'd be playing Arthur. Just before seeing it, I saw an interview with him where he was saying that the downside to playing his star-making role Tim Canterbury in The Office is the fact that it becomes very difficult to crawl out from underneath the shadow of a character like Tim after playing him for so long. Well Martin, if you want to crawl out from underneath that shadow, then playing Arthur Dent in this brainless excuse for a movie is not the best direction to go in. He'd showed such magical comic ability with parts in The Office, Ali G, and Hardware...Hitchhiker's, sorry to say, is a considerable step backwards.The good news is, it's not solely Martin's fault. By no means should all of the blame be laid on him. He does his best with what he has to work with. Problem is, what he has to work with is so damn little, there's just no way that he can save it. The main issues here are the terrible script and the fact that there's so little weight to the story. Not a trace of depth anywhere. The characters are paper-thin and the plot line tries to cram so many different adventures into it that there's no time to get absorbed into anything. There's an escape subplot, a highjack subplot, some other subplot that's no more engaging than the other two - it's all so convoluted that by the end your head's spinning. We'll put it this way: I've watched the movie and don't have a clue what it's about.And no, you won't necessarily understand it any better if you're at all familiar with the Doug Adams' kickstarter on which this drivel is based, because they didn't even have the decency to stay faithful to their source material. It's NOTHING like the show. It's quite clear that they just took the main hook of the stories and then rewrote the rest according to what THEY thought were good ideas. About the only thing that this movie has in common with its originator is the remaining of the characters' names. As such, fans of the TV series will really just be furious that the producers completely ignored everything about the show which made that work and replaced it with pointless gobble-de-gook. So the movie against the tome can be summed up quite simply: it's less funny, and it all feels slightly more forced, as if they're using a pair of pliars to wrench your mouth into a grin.Exhibit A: the terribly developed love story between Arthur and Trillian. Memo to Hollywood morons: if you really MUST feature a love story in your remake that never took place in the original, then kindly follow the three rules of a good romance: make it sweet, make it believable, and for God's sake GIVE IT A FITTING PLACE IN THE STORYLINE. The ""love story"" in this film does none of these. I NEVER understand why Arthur falls for Trillian. They meet at a party where she invites him to come away with her, telling him that she just ""has to get away"". Now never mind the fact that no sane person would ask somebody whom they'd JUST MET to come away to another country with them; because he says no (so he's the sensible one, in other words) she decides that he's not worth it. Go figure. So when they next meet, she's ditched him to take off with Sam Rockwell because he flies a sweet spaceship that has nifty gadgets and walk-in closets. Oh SHE'S likable!! And HE'S made fun of for ""blowing it"" with HER? By the end of the film, after also rescuing her from a near-death situation which she shows absolutely no gratitude for, Arthur has nevertheless decided that she's ""The One"".How'd THAT happen?! Man I'd hate to think what his past girlfriends were like! These two haven't even had a chance to really get to know each other. At last count, there were only about three scenes in the entire film (count 'em, three) where they're actually left alone together to share a one-on-one conversation, and the few things that they do find out about each other they don't like. The rest of the movie was spent flying around the universe trying to save it. So where exactly did they find the time to fall in love throughout all of that? Nobody finds The One THAT quickly, after ten minutes of talking and having nothing in common anyway.Exhibit B: the story itself. Nonsense. Characters pop up for no good reason, while entire scenes are played out just to get a good stunt in. The pace is too slow in the wrong places and too fast in others. You'll get through one scene and before you have time to work out what the purpose of that scene was for, it's abandoned and no longer needed. That whole thing about ""The Ultimate Question"" absolutely baffled me - I'm still hard-pressed to name what exactly the point to that scene was. And about three-quarters through the film it really didn't matter anymore, because I'd lost so much interest in the story that I honestly didn't care what was going to happen.The characters are moronic, the story sucks, the premise is atrociously executed...one of the MOST disappointing of 2005. Avoid. 2 stars out of ten for, as I mentioned earlier, the manic-depressive robot who works on board the ship, probably the only funny creature in the film and easily the most believable out of everybody else there. I swear man, it's a sign.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
401,MikeisBored,"Not prefect, but true to the source.",7,29 April 2005,"In 2004 it was announced that a Disney backed studio production of the popular cult sci-fi comedy tale ""The Hitchhikers Guide To The Galaxy"" had begun shooting.This made many fans of the series angry and was widely regarded as a bad move.To even try to make the tale of Arthur Dent, total improbability, and life, the universe...and everything is a bold task. Anyone familiar with creator, Douglas Adams' work, knows that his humor relies heavy on narration and interior thought; something that doesn't translate well into the film medium. But if history has proved anything about the many forms of ""The Guide"" (a radio broadcast, series of books, TV miniseries, video game...) it's that each incarnation always brings out something fresh and original to the series.Certainly, this is a movie to take your friend to, if your friend is the type to indulge himself on hallucinogenics before his movie going experience. Without a doubt, this is the fastest and most explosive telling of the guide yet. The effects (a genius blend of Jim Henson creature shop style and modern computer animation) consistently bring the story to life with every scene. The pacing hardly lets up seemingly cramming every oddity of the universe into 109 minutes. The spirit of the guide is captured brilliantly, with unpredictability at every turn, leading to a thoughtful look into... ""Why?""Unfortunately, an adventure that goes in circles with no purpose, and leaves us asking questions or shrugging ""that's life"" doesn't make for the best cinema, especially those accustomed to the ""beginning / middle / end"" case closed story. Fans of the series shouldn't blame the film for these problems; it's just not made for the cinema realm. The same goes for such classic Guide moments as ""The Sperm Whale"". Hilarious on paper, but basically the same exact thing, just spoken out loud with the visual image of a whale on the screen. Hopefully to guide virgins this is a hit, but I found myself looking at my watch during bits like these.You can blame Disney for the ridiculous ""childrenising"" of the film. I suppose in America, if a comedy doesn't have swearing or sex, or anything shocking to make the teens shout ""OH SNAP"" at the one-liners, it's therefore inherently a kids film. Not only was this film packaged with terrible cliché G rated trailers, but the film itself was covered with terrible ""boastful or ""oh, here is something delightfully funny"" music. Not to mention any jokes, heck, even most of the afterthoughts, of the end of the human race were cut; turning the feeling of the film from dark comedy to ""wait a minute, does Arthur even care everything and everybody he ever knew is gone?"" Finally, fans of the books will be disappointed by the result of Marvin's actions at the end of the film. Nowhere near as dark and hilarious as in the original series.The only real problem with the film itself as a film is its pacing. If perhaps a few corny bits were edited out, we might have had time to settle down with Arthur and his Earthly problems, before he (and we, since the story is revealed to us as it is to him) is hurled into space and the insanity that ensues. I never felt connected to Arthur until about 2/3 through the film, when we were given some breathing room. Zaphod is played to the T with every inch of flair and enthusiasm in Sam Rockwell's body, but it isn't after quite a while (and reveled to us in a soft, fleeting moment) we learn just what in the heck his deal is and why he acts like a maniac.Newbies to the guide with an open mind to deliberately scattered storytelling, and those not afraid to laugh at humor that *doesn't* have genitalia gags, are in for a fun story. Fans of the guide should see this for spectacular effects that finally do the story justice, outstanding and enthusiastic acting by all players, and perhaps the last fresh Adams material before his passing. Just try not to be so disappointed your favorite line was cut for time, or that you don't find yourself laughing at the same bits as much as you had before.An honest, but mediocre effort. With a more experienced director, this could have been a knockout film. Despite being underwhelmed by the whole thing, I'm hoping this film will achieve enough cult status and generate enough new fans of the guide to warrant a sequel.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
402,NorthEgg,Sam Rockwell is a F-ing Genius!,10,30 April 2005,"WOW! I don't think they could have done better. Having read the book, listened to (most of) the radio series, and seen the BBC TV miniseries, I believe this adaptation was nothing short of incredible. Like the title says, Sam Rockwell is a f-ing genius. He really made the movie. It's almost like Zaphod was written for him. Martin Freeman did a perfect Arthur, and Mos Def surprised me by playing a wonderful Ford. However, I think Bill Nighy was my second favorite casting as Slartibartfast.As for the elements newly written for the big screen, e.g. Humma Kavula and the Arthur-Trillian love theme, I personally think they worked. I'm glad they expounded on the ""Coming of the Great White Handkerchief""--it was hilarious. The love theme, I realize, was to make the movie more commercial, and that is why I think it worked. My husband is one who thinks it was trite and cliché. To each his own.Overall, it was worth the wait. Absolutely incredible. Go see it NOW!",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
403,calico_demon,Oh dear....,6,1 May 2005,"So disappointing....Having been first a fan of the radio play, then a fan of the TV series and then a fan of the books, i have been looking forward to this film since i first heard it was being made. Last night, i made the trip to the cinema and settled down with my popcorn and coke.And how i wished i had stayed at home and watched the telly.There is a lot of good things about this film. Some genius funny touches and some 'spot-on' characterisations. But the film as a whole is a HUGE let down.The good things: Slartibartfast - My favourite character in all adaptations of the story. And Bill Nighy is excellent.The Guide - Stephan Fry is excellent. And the clips from The Guide are very funny Zaphod - very good. Just like I imagined him from the books.One-Liners - some of the jokes are very witty. Good, dry, British humour.The let-downs: Arthur Dent - Okay. Not poor, not great, but OK. Mind you, he was never my favourite character anyway.Ford Prefect - awful acting. Truly awful. Wooden as wooden gets.The film itself - So boring in the middle that i almost fell asleep. Not since 'Bad Boys' have i actually felt like leaving a cinema and finding something else to do.I gave the film 6/10. Mostly because i liked some of the humour and characters. If you haven't read the books or seen the TV series, stay well away from this film. Without some prior knowledge you'll leave the cinema thinking ""what on earth was that pile of poo?"".",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
404,saketrick,Not Great. Maybe overrated.,7,8 May 2005,"I saw this movie last weekend with fair expectations. I had read all of the comments on IMDb prior to going and understood the following: some of the humor isn't for everyone, it is more of an adaptation of the hitchhiker 'story' - not just the books, and it can seem fast-paced at times.I am ""American"" and I understand there is apparently a lot of ""british humor"" in this movie - Well, I've always been a fan of shows like Monty Python, Red Dwarf, Mr. Bean, etc. I love them. And I worship the Monty Python movies. Well, I have a feeling this movies humor just ain't up to par in general .. No matter where you're from.You'll hear laughs from various sections of the audience, but rarely the audience as a whole. That's kinda sad, in my opinion. Pathetic, really.Aside from that..The movie was good! But really -- not as great as it could have been. The first half isn't so hot, but the second half is very good. A couple of great, truly dazzling sequences. However, I found myself not really giving a damn for the characters even halfway through .. especially Marvin. And yes, I understand Marvin's role is the 'depressed robot' who is mostly just there for comic relief, but damn .. He's still useless. Not very funny, and looks stupid as hell. Lame.As for the main character - He's good, and portrayed very well. I didn't have much of a problem with Mos Def in the movie. As for The other characters - the 'president' of the galaxy, and Trillian .. Odd and hard to relate with - space travelers or not. Same with Ford, really...Aaaanyway .. the movie's good, and worth seeing .. but not great. See it anyway.I give it a 7/10 - but if I could, i'd give it more of a 6.7/10.You go see it, maybe you'll think otherwise. Right? Good luck.

I cannot believe that Douglass had anything to do with this travesty of injustice based his works. I can't even count the ways this sucked. I'll take the TV adaptation from 1982. The cheap effects made it even funnier! The actors perfect. Everything that was right about the radio play/TV show was completely wrong with this POS movie. Zaphods second head hidden under his chin? WTF?? That was hideous. You could not pay me to watch this crap again. I am glad I just rented it and didn't waste my money buying this dreck. And Foed, hey black? fine but Don Cheedle please, not Mof Def, he Definitely killed Ford.The only good choice of actors from this crap was Alan Rickman as Marven.

406,trelloskilos-1,"Great plot, great actors, great cinematography...so what happened?",5,2 May 2005,"It's very easy to get caught up in the hype of a film, particularly if the hype has been simmering away for the best part of 20 years (allegedly), and despite the valiant efforts of all involved in this project, HHGTTG just doesn't quite achieve what is expected of it.Now, before everyone slates this opinion, I would like to say that I did enjoy the movie, I didn't expect a loyal and faithful rehash of the storyline in the book/TV series/game/radio show, and I didn't go into the cinema screen with the attitude that either I was going to love this film no matter what, or that I was going to hate it no matter what. I just felt that it could have been improved on with just a little vision - that's all.I do give full credit to all involved for daring to take a complex tale (even while he was writing the radio show, Douglas Adams confesses that he did not have any planned ending, or even where the next episode was going to turn up), and a ""trilogy"" of five books that traverses time, space, and throws some of the deepest philosophical questions at the reader with humorous results, must be a daunting task. I take my hat off to the directors.However, I just felt that the true atmosphere, the stamp of Douglas Adams, and the feeling that what Adams intended for the screen was absent in large amounts.***Spoilers*** My biggest gripe was the number of shortcuts the directors made. Even the TV series was brave enough in the '70's to try and recapture the sheer absurdity and lunacy of the Heart of Gold with the improbability drive activated on a very low budget. We get a pair of sofas and an odd scene involving rag dolls in the film. Oddly though, much of the special effects budget seems to have been used in less relevant scenes.The film also seems to tie up with a ""nice"" and very Hollywood ending, where Earth II is restored, the mice are vanquished, Zaphod cops off with some anonymous chick who hangs around with the Vogons, and of course, a ""hint"" of a sequel in ""The restaurant at the end of the Universe"".Moments of pure Douglas Adams comedy that made each inception of HHGTTG (such as Arthur's argument with Mr. Prosser, the origin of the Improbability drive, and even Eddie the over-eager computer) seem to have been snipped short in order for one of the cast to offer a one-liner which is badly timed.Finally, my last gripe about the film was the 'love interest' of Arthur and Trillian. I can see why it was done this way, and I don't disagree that in a 2 hour medium, having a love interest and a purpose for the film is all well and good, but they just took too long in setting it up (the fancy dress party), and not enough time developing it fully afterwards (The P.O.V gun).Despite these gripes, like I said, it was not a terrible film at all. It was very entertaining, and everyone involved has a lot to be proud of. There are some great laughs, some stunning visual moments, and scenes that I would definitely like to see again. I would recommend people to go and see it, but I would also implore them to read the book(s) afterwards, which truly capture the essence and lunacy of Adams' universe like it was intended.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
407,maximumhong,Semi-Decent Homage But Lacking True 'Britishness' of Previous Attempts,6,30 June 2006,"On one hand, it would be nice to see the next book made into a movie (which is probably inevitable at this point). On the other hand, I really didn't enjoy this incarnation very much. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't good. One could feel the spirit of Douglas Adams woven into the film, but the bottom sort of drops out about halfway through - and is only saved by Bill Nighy's much anticipated and too-brief appearance. DNA's witticisms are mostly 'dumbed down' for the Americans, and important scenarios are left dangling, unfinished. Lastly, Mos Def was dull. Cardboard dull.The film was nothing new and added very little to they 'legacy.' I enjoyed the look of the Vogons, and the new Marvin costume, and the several nods to the fans (esp the Eagles song and the appearance of the original Marvin). But in the end, that's all I felt the movie was. Just a big wave to the fans and a watered down version of the story dragging behind all the fanwank.Overall I prefer the low low budget television miniseries to this film.

But need to fill the rest in with 10 lines of text so here goes.*May contain spoilers her on in* 1st half is exactly as I remembered it. Second half bared little or no resemblance to the book. Like the Arther Trillian love interest. Trillians kidnap, the Vogons having any further significance in the book after dumping Arthur and Ford out of the airlock.I got the impression that Douglas Adams probably had lots of input on the first half, and little or no input after the heart of gold appeared.Sometimes I feel like a bit of a knit-picker, always feeling annoyed about differences between book and script. I don't mind when scripts miss things out, as they invariably need to do that. I hate when things are unnecessarily changed, or especially new things added in which don't need to be there, at the cost of lengthening a film already cut short at the expense of good parts of the book. I get the impression that screenwriters want to get a bit of their own style into the story, so they choose a couple of bits they can make their own, signatures scenes. If so can't they write their own books and make scripts of them, rather than taking great books and butchering them.

As for the design, I loved every aspect of it. The Vogons are wonderful. Magrathea is wonderful. The Heart of Gold is wonderful.

From this point of view the latest incarnation (2005) is a great success. I was transported back to the radio days very nicely !!However, in this day and age, we need visuals despite the fact that the radio series created some of the best visuals in our own minds. These visuals are absolutely stunning. The art direction is superb: The wonder begins in Arthur's home and it's demolition: It continues with the party where Arthur first meets Trillian: And these hints of the care and dedication to this fine art that we are about to see, is very evident here.

In the case of Trillian, the character is actually better than in the book. I can not imagine a better source of urbane smarmy narration for the Guide than that provided by Stephen Fry. If you are unfamiliar with the books, I recommend reading at least the first book before seeing the movie as the film is simply too short to develop the characters in any depth, so you're more likely to enjoy the it if you already know them well. One of the highlights is the segments where the Guide entries are shown in stylized color silhouette animations.

413,kgratton,"Great visuals, but little for fans to enjoy",4,29 March 2018,"The imagery in this film even caught the attention of my teenage son (briefly), but for someone who fondly remembers the books and BBC TV series it's simply too hard to watch this film without recalling that same TV series. An ideal film would have had Simon Jones as Arthur, David Dixon as Ford, Steven Fry as the narrator, Sam Rockwell as Zaphod, Zooey Deschanel as Trillian - and a director who had a clue about comic timing, and was prepared to incorporate more material from the book, less new material that was a waste of screen time.Sorry to Martin Freeman, you're a great Bilbo, but you don't capture Jones' alternating mix of acerbic intellectualism and outright panic. Mos Def has none of Dixon's wide-eyed lunacy, and as much as I loved the work of the late Alan Rickman, he really should have watched the TV series as a primer for his voice-over of Marvin. Fry was great, and clearly must have been influenced by the TV series, and I think Rockwell did very well with what was plainly a very different take on Zaphod for the film. More power to him. Bill Nighy was fine, but I miss Richard Vernon's Slartibartfast. The film's visual effects were brilliant, especially the destruction of the Earth and the Magrathean shop floor. Credit too for the truly dingy look of the Vogon constructor ship. Questions: Why does the Guide's animation look so awful in the film? And what was with the Humma Kavula sub-plot? It seemed to go nowhere, almost as if the character were to be reintroduced in a sequel. Less John Malkovich, more one-line comedy from the book, I say. Garth Jennings directed this film without apparently any feel for the comedy of the source material. The lines were delivered too quickly, punchlines were lost. There were just two times I laughed out loud during the film. One was when Ford and Arthur dropped out of the Vogon ship, rather than being blown out. The other was Arthur saving Ford from being run down - and only then because the car Ford was trying to greet was a Ford Prefect. That would have gone right over the heads of most cinema-goers, I'm sure. Of the other new material for the film, the point-of-view gun was a cute idea, but lacking the deadly, mind-warping scope of the total perspective vortex, which seems like a similar idea on a larger scale. I hate that this review sounds like a whinge from someone set in his ways, but I truly believe comedy has been the biggest victim here. Perhaps someone sympathetic will take charge of this story with a reboot in about five or 10 years' time. I have my fingers crossed.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

This schlockexists purely as a good example of how to ruin something great.IMDB is asking if this review contains spoilers, it doesn't.

416,Mad Dog McLagan,Loved it from start to finish,10,5 May 2005,"This film could well be the most unjustly reviled film I've ever seen. I never thought I'd see Douglas Adams purists foaming at the mouth, but that day has now come. If you listen to these people, you'll hear that the film is absolutely rubbish because we don't hear about how the Babel Fish proves the non-existence of God.I, however, went in not having read the books for years, only vaguely remembering a few of those riffs of comic genius that Adams penned, willing to be amazed.I was amazed.A problem that people have with this film is that it is simply fun. It has Adams cartoony zaniness in abundance and it has the pretentious tongue-in-cheek intellectualism, which for me captures Adams's spirit in an instance. But more than that. The film has also been giving jaw-droppingly beautiful design and, what's more, a coherent plot! Yes. Say what you like about Adams, plotting wasn't his strong plot. I'm sure anyone who's read the whole Hitchhiker's series will agree... it was almost as if he defied all storytelling conventions. But here, the story's set up quickly. Arthur Dent, ape-descendant, and his alien friend Ford leave Earth just before the Vogons blow it up, and soon find themselves on the Heart of Gold with Zaphod Beeblebrox, President of the Galaxy, Trillian, his girlfriend, and Marvin the depressed android. The beauty of the setup is in its succinctness.We then learn Zaphod (played by the excitable Sam Rockwell) is looking for the ultimate Question, as the Ultimate Answer has been found but makes no sense. And so the quest to find the lost planet of Magrathea begins, meeting opposition from the wicked high priest Humma Kavuna and Questular Rontok, Vice President of the Galaxy who is trying to reclaim the spaceship Zaphod stole.This film is adorably silly, but the story bubbles along with the ease that the BBC TV series didn't quite have, helped by Stephen Fry, who narrates animated interludes from the Hitchhiker's Guide itself. I can't describe how lovely it is to hear him describe, in his syrupy, elitist tones, the Pan Galactic Gargle-Blaster: ""The best drink in the galaxy"".The cast are uniformly perfect: Martin Freeman is an actor I have respected for some time, even before ""The Office"", seeing him steal scenes as a Dutch DJ in ""Lock, Stock"" and other shining guest spots. Now he's truly in his element as the continually confused and frustrated Arthur Dent. Mos Def, like many people on the net, I was unsure of, but astonishingly he seamlessly became the Ford we know and love. ROckwell's Zaphod is all that I imagined. Zooey Deschanel is the only Trillian so far who felt real, and gives a perfect spot. Alan Rickman, John Malkovich, and Bill Nighy also shine very brightly in their guest spots. And my favourite part of the film guest stars Bill Bailley as a confused sperm whale. 'Nuff said.I wish this film wasn't under such scrutiny, because I don't think it's the type of film that should ever be scrutinised. Like the books before it, it's just for a bit of fun, and ends up being a LOAD of fun. I think Douglas Adams would have approved, and that's what matters to me.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
417,dlozano,Comments from someone who's never read the books,9,10 May 2005,"I really was amused by this film, even though I had no idea what to expect. It's witty, ironic, and highly entertaining via great acting and awesome screenfull after screenful.Volgons are hilarious, Trillion, Marvin, Arthur are superbly played by Zooey, Allen Rickman, and forgive me, I'm not so familiar with the Brit who played Arthur, so I can't give his name. He had the perfect every man look, and played the character with subtlety and hilarity. Mos Def was just brilliant and the most pleasant of surprises. I like him in everything I've seen him in (think Monster's Ball, etc.), but he was astonishing in this movie. I'm really impressed. With this film, he's proved to me he's an actor and I look forward to other films with him.I am one of those who though Sam Rockwell's character was given way to much time on the screen. Think Jar Jar Binks. Enough is enough already. As my dear friends who are Douglas Adams fans said to me after the film, that character is supposed to be annoying. I reply, so were the Volgons, but they were funny, not just annoying. Rockwell's scenes needed editing, so I don't think it's his fault. He's one of those characters whose best in smaller doses.As Roger Ebert said in his review, those unfamiliar with the books will be confused by some of the fast references, but will be entertained enough to learn more, or they will just be annoyed and say ""what's the point?"". (one of my favorite lines in the film!) I'm going to see the movie again this weekend and I'm going to read the books.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
418,msree,"Not very spoilery, just a little.",9,22 August 2005,"The beginning of the movie threw me. They added something that wasn't in the book. I knew they couldn't fit in everything that was in the book, so the addition of new stuff was an unpleasant surprise. I didn't enjoy the intro as much as I might have because of this reaction. I decided at that point that I would just watch the movie without constantly comparing it to the book, just give it a chance. I loved it. Ford was as much fun as I expected and Marvin was brilliant. Alan Rickman as Marvin was inspired. The special effects were very good though I didn't like the way they handled Zaphod's extra head. I don't know if they are going to do the other books, but if the same people do, I'll see those films when they come out.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

(Spoilers Most Likely)",10,29 April 2005,"I've been a fan of the Hitchhiker books for a long time, but I had never seen/heard an adaption till now. I really enjoyed it, but in the context of it as a stand alone film. It isn't the book. There are a lot of changes, but none of them really distracted me and Douglas Adams had been involved in the writing of the screenplay up until his death so a great many of the changes were his. I put it on book/film adaptions up with Interview with the Vampire: Both really, really good, but with differences from the book. The one complaint I hear the most is the Humma Kuvula subplot. My feeling is that their intending to tie up that subplot in a sequel if one is made (when you see it you'll find the possibility of a sequel isn't even subtley hinted at so much as blatantly said). I think people who will dislike this movie with be die-hard fans and those without any familiarity with it. Since I'm in the middle of that (a fan, but not a die-hard one necessarily), I loved it. The look fit (for the most part) what I had always envisioned and the casting was pretty good. Definitely worth seeing.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
420,Adamjammer,A bit underwhelmed,7,11 August 2005,"I first discovered the books during summer camp one year when our counselor read them aloud to us as we fell asleep each night. From there I checked the books out of the library, eventually bought them, and in all devoured every bit of Douglas Adams' writing I could. It was with a mixture of anticipation and trepidation that I then went to see the movie. Here's the low-down.In all, I must admit, I was a bit underwhelmed. I know, the human imagination is far superior to nearly any movie out there, but I was still surprised at just how disappointed I was with some aspects of the movie. The props first and foremost come to my mind. I suspect the director was simply trying to capture the zaniness and whacky feel of Adams' books in that some of the props and costumes seem a bit clunky and farcical. But at the same time, it just didn't work for me. That in one movie you can have absolutely breathtaking scenes of Marvin the robot on the ice planet as well as shots from inside the factory (people who've seen the movie will know what I'm talking about, to those of you who don't I can't give it away), and yet have some fairly subpar costumes and depictions of certain creatures and elements of the book, I just personally found it to be a bit of a letdown.But let's go down the list. I've already talked about the props, special effects, costumes, etc.Plot: It stayed fairly faithful to the series for the most part. There were some liberties taken I felt, but since Douglas Adams was a consultant on the script (he might even have been a writer, I'm not sure) before he passed away, I can't quibble too much. The first 45 minutes or so of the movie (after you get past the dreadfully ridiculous credits, at least that's how I saw them as I feel they again tried to capture the off-beat humor of Adams and failed) are very well-paced and well-scripted. Dialogue is tight, action is tight, and the laughs are fairly continuous and smooth. It's as good a first 45 minutes as you'll find in most movies. Alas, around the 45 mark it falters and slips into a dragging tone. The movie tries to be a bit too tense and dramatic (which is odd since they tried in the first place to capture Adams humor and failed in some spots) and the added emotions over some of Arthur Dent's (the main character) decisions and his love with Trillium and whatnot are unnecessary. It becomes too much a story of ""one man's journey to find himself"" which is I feel, not in the spirit of the books. Just get along with the funny and the action and the good stuff! It manages to stagger across the finish line and end well enough.Actors: Trillium was passable, Zaphod was like a puppy, cute and likable at the start but pretty soon you wanted him to just shut-up and go away. A bit to Jim Carey-ish for me. Arthur was good enough too, no great find but he passed as the bewildered average joe caught in it all. It's Mos Def's turn as Ford that won me over. I'd only ever seen Mos Def on Chappelle's Show before this movie, and he was great in the sketches, albeit his time was a bit short. But in this movie he did a great job in not only delivering the lines humorously but in living the character as a whole. The runner-up for best actor would be Alan Rickman's voice over as Marvin, a robot so depressed he would make Eyeore look like Richard Simmons. I honestly could never hear in my head how Marvin ""should"" sound, but now it's hard to imagine anyone other than Rickman voicing him.Overall, it was good, but not great. The movie's worth a rental if you're a fan of the book (but be forewarned it's no match) and if you're not then you can probably pick it up and still enjoy it, although I can't highly recommend it on its merits alone without the books to prop it up. So I guess you should go out and read the books. Then you can see it",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
421,Duirmuid,this is a personal opinion.,5,3 May 2005,"The fact that I have given this a five, don't let that put you off. If you have seen the mini series and read (and reread) the book then there is going to be nothing new in this for you. If you haven't see the series or read the book then you are going to love the film.The only thing that I had a problem with was the love ""triangle"". But its different and all that. No problem.looks very good though.Marven is cool.The Heart of Gold is very cool.i think that this is the 11th line.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
422,ladyeuthanasia,"Very funny, even if it fell in places",7,30 April 2005,"After rather brilliant opening credits, the film was choppy in the beginning. Babelfish translation: They really f-ed it up. Until Arthur and Ford actually get picked up by the Starship Heart of Gold, the story is disconnected in places and they use ploys that don't work to shorten setup sequences that ought to have been left alone. (These are the same setup sequences that Douglas Adams never changed himself, regardless of the medium in which he told the story, and there's a reason for that.) So, if you're not intimately familiar with the setup, you could easily get a bit lost. And if you are familiar with it, you'll get annoyed and easily see how some things just don't make sense. (For example, Ford racing to Arthur's house with a shopping cart of beer and peanuts when he's apparently not aware of the demolition crew. Clearly the shopping cart was an ill-fitting plot ploy to ""bypass"" the classic exchange between Ford and the construction crew foreman.) Zaphod, however, makes up for many ills. Even as the movie continues to stumble along like Frankenstein, flexing its new parts stiffly and clumsily (a fan can pretty easily distinguish which parts were Adams' new ones and which were not), the brilliance of Sam Rockwell as Zaphod goes a very long way to keep things entertaining. I loved this Zaphod dearly, almost as much as the original. Also, as they built up the chase to capture Zaphod and the stolen ship (a plot line that Adams should have developed way back when), they employed the Vogons as bad guys, expounding on their bureaucratic foibles in many very funny ways.The part they handled most deftly was the first half of the visit to Magrathea. Arthur's visit with Slartibartfast to where they manufacture the planets was breathtaking. I felt the heart of the movie here, and found a connection with Arthur that I hadn't had through the entire film. That's not to say that Martin Freeman wasn't really good throughout, but this sequence was his best acted by far. However, I must add that they -- again -- screwed up part of a classic sequence by trying to abbreviate it. As a result, the reason that the mice want Arthur's brain is fuzzily expressed at best.I can't overlook Stephen Fry and The Book. Not only was his narration flawless, but the animated sequences that went with it were especially funny. And Marvin -- oh, god. Alan Rickman was completely brilliant, as usual.Still. It was, as I mentioned, clumsy in parts. Really clumsy. The new sequences in the story were so forced at times I wanted to punch someone. I liked the romance between Arthur and Trillian a lot, although Trillian was flat as a character. But I don't especially like how they juggled the detours (except one, which involves Marvin and a lot of Vogons; that was extremely funny and, I suspect, originally from Adams). The movie was only 1 hr and 50 min. They could have left in five or six extra minutes to clarify some points. But, alas. The rating of 7 is because of the humor only.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
423,Mab890,"Its OK, but yet just doesn't cut it",7,29 May 2005,"I have loved the books, I have read the books, well at least the first four, and this movie came out making me feel so-so, and yet still disappointed. It was fun watching old jokes come to life, and some things were done very well. The director was quite creative and the actors more or less accomplished their job. But sad to say i the movie cut things i loved and changed things i love which makes me overly critical. It had its moments and if your bored on night and want to rent something be my guest. The saddest part of the movie is tied with a witty comment left by Marvin at the end of the film, (if i were to quote i would be breaking spoiler rules), nevertheless it gives an ominous feeling that sequels are not in our future.

424,calmly_insane,One For The Ages,10,14 May 2005,"Attention people of Earth: Don't panic when you go to see this movie. There are a few things though, that aren't quite right with the movie. If you haven't read the books, you may not get the towel comments, or the couches, right away. But Don't Panic. I am one of those people who haven't read the books, but I must say, Garth Jennings has done a marvelous job putting the book to the screen. This movie is one for the ages. The acting was incredible. Hats off to Martin Freeman, Mos Def, Sam Rockwell, and the rest of the gang. Choosing the non big-time actors for the movie was probably very smart, because the audience would not have a typecast for any of these people. The effects. Oh my, the effects. The Vogons (a very VERY ugly species)looked like they were done with puppetry, as were many things in this movie. Today we're so used to seeing CG, that puppetry has become a thing of the past. Yet, it makes for something so much more real. Which looks more real to you, the Yoda puppet, or the new CG guy? But then again, the CG in this movie is used only when needed, and that's a smart move too! There are many things the human brain cannot grasp in this movie. The scale of things is one of them. When we see the immense, enormous, gigantic factory floor, the brain almost chooses NOT to accept it. An entire factory floor devoted to building planets. That's right, one factory builds planets. Earth Mark-2, an exact duplicate of the first one. The movie going audience today has no sense of wonder, and this movie will make sure you're filled with it. No more will small children only be able to be filled with that sense. Adults, grandparents alike will feel like a kid again.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
425,quint88,Disappointing...,6,16 May 2005,"While I realize that it is difficult to meet everyone's expectations, I think that the filmmaker's blew it with what could have been the year's best movie. To start off, I'd like to say that I am a huge fan of the earlier 'Hitchhiker' books. They never seemed to drag and more importantly, you never asked yourself 'What the bloody hell is going on?"" Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for the movie.I'll start off with the stuff that I liked. I found that I preferred the 'look' of the movie to the universe I had imagined while reading the book, which doesn't happen very much. I thought that everything, from the spaceships to the characters looked even better than I had imagined. Also, the puppets from Jim Henson's puppet shop were incredible. I found it worthwhile to sit through the movie just to watch the big, ugly...alien. Even though they were huge green blobs, you could believe that they existed, and were much more realistic that in they had used CGI.And the CGI was incredible as well. The planet factory place was astounding, along with all the other backdrops though out the movie.The opening song was also quite funny, but it got my hopes up for the remainder of the screen time. Which brings me to the parts which I didn't like, like for instance, the added in love triangle. In the original book, Trillian played a mostly secondary role to the rest of the story. The filmmakers elevated her part so much that about three quarters of the movie was devoted to the love story. The added in subplot with Zaphod's old campaign enemy, John Malcovitch, was a strain also. While the whole 'Nose-worshipping' bit was amusing, I had absolutely no clue what was going on. The added on happy ending and the changed roles of the mice and Slartibartfast was disappointing and not very funny or inspiring.I thought that Alan Rickman was a perfect voice for Marvin, and he looked very much like how i thought he would, but all of his very funny lines from the book (and everyone else's, for that matter) became...not funny. And the trailer made it look so good...I was especially disappointed with the flyswatter bit.My over all recommendation is: Watch the trailer and read the book instead, and if you want to watch the movie, mute all the parts except with the puppetry and read the book.*** out of *****, and i give it that because i liked the books.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
426,Danielle31,Not Even A Renter!,1,18 March 2008,"I happened to see this on the weekend it opened. I knew there was going to be trouble when a total of five people (and that included me, my husband & father-in-law) were in the theater. And as I watched the movie, I was desperately wishing I was one of the lucky millions who didn't bother to attend. I'm guessing the other four people thought the same thing, because no one laughed once, and the two people I didn't know in front of me started talking to each other 1/4 of the way into the movie. As for me, I consider it to be in the top five of the worst movies I've ever seen.Granted, this wasn't the easiest story to adapt to film. It has a very convoluted plot and a lot of scenes would require major CGI effects. Still, with the right director, a script written by someone who was familiar with Douglas Adams' work, and the right casting, this film could have been brilliant. But none of that happened and the movie is an utter disaster and it shows. This is the directors' first attempt at a movie and believe me, it is very obvious. The camera work, sets, costumes, etc. are messy and amateurish. The script seems to be written by an American who never bothered to read any of the Hitchhiker stories and apparently didn't care. The script has been Hollywoodized and Americanized without any of Adams' wit. And the casting...oy vey...they went horribly wrong with this. The only one they got right was Martin Freeman as Arthur Dent. Everyone else was very ill suited to their roles and uttered their lines like they were reading from cue cards, with the exception of Sam Rockwell, who went out of his way to overact and be as annoying as humanly possible in the role of Zaphod Beetlebrox. In the middle of the movie where he is basically in a semi-comatose state, I was relieved that finally they got him to shut up! This was the part I was most disappointed in. In the books, Zaphod is my favorite character. He is an idiot and jerk in the books, but his charm and sense of humor more than make up for this. In the movie, he is simply an idiot and jerk with an grating southern accent. And in the movie, his heads are one on top of the other and once in a great while, the other 'head', (which is nastier than the original Zaphod, if that is possible) pops up. My question is, why couldn't they make the heads side by side like in the original story? Anyway, the Zaphod character and changes they made with the head, make the movie look very low budget, even though it is not a low budget movie at all. (I read somewhere that the movie cost $50 million dollars to make.) So, if the plot has been tampered with, so all the wit and life has been sucked out of it, and the actors are horrible, and it's obvious the directors have no idea what they're doing, all you're left with is fantastic CGI right? NO! The special effects are passable, at best. They don't take advantage of the technology out there and there really isn't that much to see.I think this movie is ripe for a remake. Heck, even though I've never directed a movie in my life, I could probably do a better job than than the dudes who directed it. I think anybody on the street could. At least I could dream up a better script to work with than the scriptwriting computer program that wrote this (the story's that by-the-numbers, trust me). I'm a writer myself and at least I'm familiar with Adams' work.I'm not going to reveal the ending (not that it matters because the ending sucks), but they strongly hint at the possibility of a sequel. Oh Gahd, I hope not! I'll watch ""Bride of Chucky"" ten times over before I'll watch the TRAILER to the sequel to this movie.If you see this at Redbox, don't even bother renting it.

429,petehazell,Wasted opportunity,1,14 November 2005,"The radio series was stunning, the books were excellent, the TV series was pretty good, I've not experienced the towel, but the film was awful. The cast was almost uniformally dire, and while it's always nice to see Simon Jones, he was the best person in it and his inclusion served to show just how bad the re-casting was. There were a few good things about this film - Alan Rickman was very good as the voice of Marvin, Stephen Fry excelled as the book (replacing Peter Jones was always going to be difficult, but Stephen Fry was an admirable choice) and the effects were a considerable improvement on the TV series. On the downside, Martin Freeman was the only one of the main cast who appeared to be even trying to play his character as written, and at times appeared to have given up in the face of the insurmountable task of trying to raise everyone else's performances.Sam Rockwell tried desperately to be charismatic as Zaphod Beeblebrox. He didn't stand a chance. Watch the BBC TV version, and Mark Wing-Davey manages to be apparently effortlessly charming even though he has to cope with an animatronic second head. The film version neatly sidesteps this necessity, and even so Rockwell has all the charm of a heap of vomit on the carpet. Similarly, Ford Prefect is supposed to be an alien with a vast amount of experience of hitch-hiking. To say that Mos Def gives a one-note performance would be far too high praise for him. He couldn't act his way out of a wet paper bag if someone else had torn it up for him first.

Still, it worked quite well. I especially liked the extra relationship items between Arthur and Trillian. While it definitely wouldn't have worked with the characters in previous incarnations, there was something about Zooey Deschanel that just made it work.Almost all the actors were a perfect fit. The sole exception was Mos Def as Ford Prefect. While he started out quite well in the role, later on, as his character was overshadowed by the others, he came off as an unnecessary add-on. To make matters worse, after that time he sounded like a drunk or drugged-out guy, saying things that were so difficult to understand at times (due to slurred speech, not due to obtuse humor) that I had to wonder why he was allowed on the set.

Bush; especially the line when explaining the reason for his two faces, about discovering that it only took half a brain to be president. Actually I think he was a little more than just inspired; at times he seems to be doing an impersonation of the president, as in the confused look on his face before needing the lemon juice transfusion.There are so many gags and funny remarks in this film that I will have to see it more than once, just to catch them, just as I had to read the books more than once.The film is visually striking as well.

It's impossible to add everything into a movie that you can read in a book, especially if the reader has a vivid imagination and of course Hollywood is going to add things to make movies appeal to the masses. And considering that Douglas Adams, the book's author, was one of the executive producers of the film, his seal of approval is good enough for me. Although it probably helps that I didn't read the book because I may have felt let down (as I was with the remake of The Time Machine, which was nothing like the H.G. Wells version, but Wells wasn't alive to put his producer's mark on that one), but since I haven't read it, I really can't say either way.

438,taylor_mayed,Another disappointing movie adaptation,4,23 May 2005,"I suppose it's in a way unfair to judge the film in comparison to the books, radio series, television series, partly because it has to be designed to stand alone and partly because they were all made with the benefit of their writer and creator being actually alive and involved. I did try to sit back and enjoy the film without thinking 'they've changed that they've missed that out,' but come on. It's impossible. This is the Hitch-Hiker's Guide, for goodness sakes! It's also difficult because of the film-makers themselves and their little touches to the past. Perhaps the best moment for me was the shot of the Guide itself floating through space, the title revealed to the familiar strains of the original Flight of the Sorcerer theme tune by The Eagles. I thought at this point 'Yes! This is where this film is finally going to start!' but it never really happened. Simon Jones as the Magrafean hologram and of course the original BBC Television Marvin in the Vogon office queue were also nice to see and reminders that this was frankly not as good as any other version of the story there's ever been.Let's start with Marvin himself, shall we? I was quite optimistic when I heard Alan Rickman's voice for him in the trailer, but the character here is just very very wrong. The original Marvin was depressed, grumpy and not only had a brain the size of a planet but an ego the size of one. One of the whole points of Marvin is his massive superiority complex, but he's portrayed here with an inferiority complex, seeming more pathetic and whiney than the iconic character he was first time around.Speaking of characters being done badly, Mos Def as Ford Prefect was just dire. Well, perhaps he wasn't so bad, just what he was being asked to do was wrong. Ford is a mysterious, perhaps somewhat arrogant freeloader who just didn't care. Again maybe it's unfair to judge him against David Dixon (always my favourite Ford, with all due respect to the original radio show's Geoffrey McGivern) but rather than being enigmatic and frustrating, Def's Ford is just a bit Well Camp and silly.Zaphod was better (shame about just the one head) and much easier to get used to seeing as how he was always played as a faux Yank anyway. And at the risk of seeming alarmingly sexist, the film's Trillian is a hell of a lot prettier than Sandra Dickinson, and again as the character was a Yank on TV I don't mind her being so here. (I didn't hear the radio series  where Trillian is of course English  until after I'd seen the TV show and read the books so I always have the TV fixed as the imagery and voices in my mind).On the subject of Trillian though, her love story with Arthur  why??? For God's sake, why turn the thing into a soppy, vomit-inducing sub-Hugh Grant romantic comedy? Please don't say anybody's trying to turn Martin Freeman into the new Grant. Mind you, he's already halfway there by playing Tim, his character from The Office in everything he does, just as every single Hugh Grant performance for the past decade or so has just been Charles from Four Weddings by any other name.Aside from all that Well, I liked Mirren as the voice of Deep Thought and Fry as the voice of the book, although it was a shame so many of the classic Guide sections were cut so short. The woollen bit was good, and Bill Nighy was great as Slartibartfast, but overall Nah. I think I'll stick with my DVD of the TV series thanks. The movie may have better effects, but you can't beat the older version's humour and character.Please don't let these people make The Restaurant at the End of the Universe, or I might cry.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
439,agentorange2000,"Really, really shockingly bad movie",3,1 May 2005,"Almost unwatchable - flat, uninspired, unenthusiastic, direction-less,and, worst of all, not funny. As bad as Vogon poetry, which makes it something like the third worst thing in the universe. And then there's an inexplicably strange subplot involving John Malkovitch...Granted, I appreciate trying to add something to the movie that hasn't already been done in the book, the radio series, or the TV series. The whole 'Point of View Gun' thing, however, came across as unnecessary - it wasn't needed for plot progression (since Arthur and co. were heading to Magrathea anyway), Malkovitch wasn't developed as a villain, and the subplot was never resolved (Does Zaphod get his head back? Does he ever remember that he lost it?).I actually thought HHGG might be all right for the first fifteen minutes or so, but it just seemed to lose all its energy as soon as Ford and Arthur were improbably picked up by the Heart of Gold. Maybe it was a fault with the direction, but the characters just didn't entertain me. Zaphod and Ford were too daft - they couldn't seem to complete a sentence and were constantly falling over, dancing, or just flailing - Trillian was mostly blank, and there wasn't enough Arthur to keep everything on the level. It all came across as too frantic and loose.The audience I watched HHGG with appeared to have a mixed reaction to the movie. Some people walked out before the end, others hooted at every fan-geek reference to towels, babel fish, Eccentrica Galumbits, and so on.There were things that I enjoyed about HHGG. The opening number was unexpected and silly. The budget meant that the visuals, at least, were miles beyond what the TV series could offer - the planet-building sequence offered some of the books' sardonic sense of wonder at a galaxy that was really, really unimaginably big but at the same time recognisable and ridiculous.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
440,jyancura,I was wildly amused,6,17 May 2005,"I was wildly amused by the big screen version of Hitchhiker's Guide. It has been awhile since I've read the book and my wife has never read the books. None the less, we were charmed by the cheeky randomness of the script and performances. Sam Rockwell gives and over the top as Zaphod Beeblebrox. He pushed the character to the maximum level of absurdity. Alan Rickman also shined as the voice of Marvin the Robot. John Malkovich's cameo added a nice touch. However, I felt like Mos Def was not able to run with the Ford Prefect character.This movie is not for those who take themselves too seriously or believe that only art should make it to the big screen. I wouldn't venture to call the film a classic and from what I remember, it is less than the book or radio show. However, Hollywood has been kinder to this franchise than it has others. At times the movie approaches creative and original. It is not as good as it could be, but it is definitely not as bad.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

I was looking forward to watching this movie with my family in hopes that they would get at least a glimpse into the world of Douglas Adams and hopefully spark some interest in them into reading books with his style of writing , no such luck again. What I got was a feeble attempt to jam five books into an hour and a half long movie and they didn't even bother to try to have it make any sense at all to people who haven't read the book. What were they thinking? There is enough material there to make an hour and a half long movie for each of the five books if someone was to take the time and the effort to do it right.

However, I'm not one of those who has over expectations of film versions of books, but I can honestly say, this is a high quality film. There are touches of comic genius, and where it does stray from the book (and believe me, it does) it remains 'Adamsesque'. Casting was top-notch for this and but for a slight lack of excitement and perhaps slightly too short to bring all the ideas to life, this is an excellent movie. The only major disappointment for me was Zaphod Beeblebrox who I thought wasn't played as well as he could have been and Ford isn't as prominent in the film as he is in the book.This is one not to miss.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
444,smokyjoe123,well.......,5,2 May 2005,"As a huge fan of the book/s i was both looking forward to seeing how others viewed the story but also worried that the whole thing would be wrecked. After watching it, i can say that my view is somewhere in the middle of the two extremes. I was pleased with certain aspects of the film, but generally, the huge plot change was fairly pointless. I know Adams said that there was no definitive version of the story, but what i enjoyed about the books was the wholesome ambiguity about it. Everything is random and you can enjoy the fact that anything could happen next. But when watching the film, you can pretty much tell what's going to happen after Dent meets Trillian at the party flashback. They chickened out and made it 'appeal' to everyone they could. The introduction of a mostly American cast obviously makes it mainstream, something i felt that the book was intended not to be. Also, that irritating love triangle bit with Zaphod/dent and trillian just makes it look like a 5 year old wrote it after reading a fairytale. And Rickman read Marvin badly; it sounded as if he had nose plugs in after some electro shock treatment! I think it said a lot that the only thing i found truly funny in the film was Eddie the on-board computer. Adams was a genius and must be recognised as such. But unfortunately those who finished the film off got it wrong in my opinion. Don't misinterpret though; There are some good moments, but the bad ones just stick out. I was cringing with embarrassment at the opening song. They tried Monty python-esquire comedy and it fell flat on its face, seeming more like the opening of a Disney film based on dolphins (or has that already been done?). Anyway, give it a look if you like your preconceptions of a great series ruined, if not just read the books again, they are funnier than the film ever could be.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
445,dye-3,a disappointing film on many levels,1,30 April 2005,"I saw this flick opening night with some friends who are big fans of the book. I have not read the book, but have only heard good things. I was hoping this film would capture the brilliance of Adams' work as it's been shared with me. Unfortunately, the film failed to deliver. This flick really has no plot. Most of the film's events come as complete surprises; I suppose that randomness was supposed to add to the *wackiness* of the whole experience. It quickly became nauseating. In this case, I wish I'd watched ANY of the advertised films in the trailers instead of the feature film. That's a HUGE claim: ""The Adventures of Shark Boy and Lava Girl"" was in there .. {shudder}.The characters in the film are empty and shallow. Sam Rockwell's character was mildly amusing at best, Marvin (the Jar-Jar Binks of the movie) was predictably dull, and the Vogons were just lame. I really didn't care about any of them, so being a part of their adventure was really boring; the love story was horribly ill-developed, The President's search for the question of the meaning of life and the universe was trite, and the mouse experimentation explanation for the existence of the Earth was, well, stupid.Let's take inventory at this point ... the film lacked both a plot and interesting characters. How does a movie redeem itself when it lacks these two essential elements, you ask? IT DOESN'T! There was no one to like and nothing to be interested in. I'm serious, people, you'll find yourselves staring at the floor, playing with pocket lint, or perhaps making a mental shopping list during the showing. We're talking about streaming nonsense ... take a pillow or a book, perhaps a deck of cards: you'll need something to pass the TWO HOURS it'll take for this disaster to wrap itself up! In the process of editing this flop, someone should have realized that there is no substance to the film and promptly cut out 30 minutes of what we'll generously call ""content."" I wanted so badly to like this film and have it be good that I waited through the entire thing for it to turn itself around. What a disappointment. Honestly, ""Future War"" and ""Cyborg"" didn't get 2 hours to torture me, why did this film get special treatment? I suppose the worst part of the film is that it's a disgrace to the book. Leave it to Hollywood to take something interesting and original and, in an attempt to package it for the mass stupids, ruin everything appealing about it. It's at a time like this that I wish I had a genie in a lamp and 3 wishes: I'd first wish that the producer and director of this film were forbidden from making more films; second, I'd wish that this film be taken from the theaters immediately; and third, I'd wish for the film to be rewritten with only two characters: Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen, and that it be released on DVD as not one film but as an series of films about their travels through the galaxy.

Moments later, his best friend (Mos Def) arrives and reveals that he's actually an alien, whisking him away on a spaceship seconds before the earth is blown to bits. There are clever (if totally obvious) parallels between our own industrialism and the earth's destruction- but as soon as the third rock from the sun explodes, the movie goes downhill. The heroes bounce from planet to planet, meeting strange new extraterrestrials with cultures that all seem to be odd parodies of our own- but the good jokes are lost somewhere amidst a jumble of confusing ideas and gags that just don't work. Martin Freeman is especially annoying, John Malkovich is wasted in a scene that goes nowhere, and Sam Rockwell is the only cast member who gets any laughs whatsoever in a frantic and totally disappointing adaptation.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

Martin Freeman = love him in general, but this wasn't his best stuff. Granted, this was made before his amazing performances as John Watson and Bilbo Baggins. Zooey Deschanel as Trillian = love her. They did her dirty in this movie, though. The voice actors were all pristine.Some scenes were nicely done. For example, the scene where Slartibartfast shows Arthur Earth 2.What I disliked most about this movie was the romance between Arthur and Trillian. It was clear from the beginning that that's where they were going for and I was not a fan. Arthur's whole ""I only have one question: Is she the one?"" -thing made me physically cringe. Just, no.

I have never listened to the original radio show version of the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy but I am a firm fan of the TV series and of course the truly brilliant book series. I thoroughly recommend the books to you (all five although this is only the first) as they are some of the finest, funniest book ever written and what of this film that is true to book is excellent, 10 out of 10 stuff. And Martin Freeman as Arthur Dent is possible THE perfect choice. Whoever did that bit of casting is a genius.So it would seem that I love this film as is is possible but there are reasons as to why this film is a 6 for me. Without wishing to give anything away there is an extra storyline completely alien to the book featuring a new character, Humma Kavula. While I know that this extra storyline is from the Brain of Douglas Adam's I just can't get into it. It seems out of place with the rest of the film, possibly because I love the book so much. Secondly, this book to me feel like a very British classic and I can't see characters like Zaphod and Ford Prefect as American, as they are in the film. While it is a good film and is brilliantly made, these two point lessened my enjoyment of it, leading to my six out of 10.Of course I do recommend this film, even if just for the brilliant MArtin Freeman but fans of the book be warned about new story lines.

It is not as funny as the book, however, we are not here to judge the book, and it is as a film that it must be judged.I think the film could have been better if the film is better paced, as it is, it is far too frantic, rushing from one scene to the next. A few of the jokes falls flat on its face by being too hurried, or perhaps the it is the actors that didn't deliver the lines well - for example the false hope raise by Ford Prefect (What's this?..This is .. nothing..) when he and Arthur Dent were about to be ejected from the Vogon spaceship missed the mark completely. I think the fault mainly lies with the director, perhaps someone with a better track record in film making would have done a better job.A few of the scenes, such as the spectacular lab for constructing planets in Magrathea, work well. Others are only so-so. I didn't like Ford Prefect and Trillian in this film, but the biggest dislike is Marvin, not entirely how I imagine him/it.

And we HAVE read the books.If you are looking for a semi-accurate retelling of what is in the books, you've set your expectations too high. The film takes the key elements of the books and BBC mini-series and re-frames them for the big screen. Gone are the jokes that take too long to explain to the simple movie-goer. (Remember in the books when Arthur discovers that the Universe is all about him - because he accidentally stumbled into a simulation of the Universe earlier?) But in their place are new twists of logic that the astute will have fun with. (Guess why the Vogans are that way - the gag looks like slapstick, but explains Vogan evolution if you are willing to pay attention). And the best parts are kept intact. (Remember the whale and the bowl of petunias?) And The Guide is there, explaining in calm, twisted, and indisputable logic the workings of this strange universe. The Guide is accompanied with wonderful, traffic sign style animation, where chunky stick figures gyrate, pull the universe from a hat, and slump into sofas because ""they never get invited to those kinds of parties"".But there were a few points I have to quibble with. Towels were trivialized. Marvin had an inexplicable resurrection. But most of all, the movie suddenly ended with a Hollywood resolution. In fact, it actually appeared that Garth Jennings checked his watch and said, ""Hey guys, let's wrap this up"". There's a group hug and the rest is done in the editing room out of left over footage.Still, the high points outweigh the low. You can't miss the musical number at the beginning of the film. Almost any time The Guide explains something, be prepared to giggle. And there is at least one laugh out loud moment whenever the Improbability Drive is engaged.My hope is that the producer will clean up the ending before releasing it to DVD.

Here they just look hopelessly cheap and outdated. Even the old TV series did a better job of the graphics. If it was supposed to be part of the humour, it didn't work.Most performances were merely OK, none of them made me think ""brilliant."" Zooey's performance is the worst in the whole film. She shows inappropriate expressions in places, e.g. smiles when they are all being threatened by John Malkovich's character, and her range is so painfully limited it hurts. How this girl got to be an actress I don't know, she spends most of the time looking wide eyed and vacant, as if she'd wandered into a manga film by accident and really didn't get it. Instead of Trillian coming across like the person she is supposed to be, an intelligent, cool headed girl with two degrees and a genuine desire to explore the universe, Zooey plays her like a bimbo fresh from high school who thinks it's ""cool"" to go out with a spaceman. Arthur would never fall for this bubblegum travesty of such a great character.A few lines save this otherwise complete mess - ""I'm British, I know how to queue"". The rest comes across as such a huge compromise to appeal to the Hollywood-centric audience, who are not known for reading much, it destroys everything that was good about HHGG.The only possible redeeming factor of this sorry catastrophe is it might get a few people reading the books, which will bring home to anyone who does how bad this tacky excuse for a cheap, popcorn flick really is.For the HHGG completist or people who never read the books.

A lot of the people who didn't like the changes from the book to the movie should know that every version is slightly different, something Douglas Adams liked. Besides, it's not like John Malkovich would ever ruin a movie. He's too good of an actor. The romance between Trillian and Arthur seemed to be conspicuously absent from the book, but I guess Adams didn't want to be formulaic with his book. He did add it here.

463,douglasjeffreys,Hugely disappointing,2,23 November 2005,I finally worked myself up to rent the DVD Hitch hikers guide and was just as disappointed as I thought I'd be. The people who made this tripe where counting on the fact that there are many fans of the book who would want to see it made into a big budget movie. The BBC production although done on a BBC budget is head and shoulders above the movie. If you haven't read the book you can't make any sense out of the film. The original silliness and dark humor that wound it's way through all the books is just so much better than the smarmy movie and sappy love story sub-plot. save yourself a few bucks and your precious time and stick to the books or try to find a copy of the BBC production. The producers of this movie should be ashamed of themselves. I guess I should have known something was wrong when they waited till Douglas Adams was dead before finishing the film.,The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
464,Professor_Marvel,Expectations are a powerful thing...,5,22 September 2005,"and mine were plenty low when I watched ""The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy."" Despite this modest anticipation I couldn't help but be disappointed with the product. I suppose my love of the book has necessarily clouded my judgment, but nevertheless here is my attempt at an objective review.I was encouraged during the opening credits to see (author) Douglas Adams' heavy involvement with the film, he is credited with co-writing the screenplay and acting as executive producer. These activities however began years ago, prior to Adams' death in 2001 (he wasn't even fifty years old).I was also excited to see that the production staff included Jay Roach, Roger Birnbaum, and other talented folks who have delivered a good deal of quality product to theaters. Although I was previously unfamiliar with director Garth Jennings, I was very familiar with legendary casting director Susie Figgis, so I was in no way surprised to with the fine ensemble cast tasked with bringing the novel to life.What I found interesting about the cast was fact that only Arthur Dent and Marvin the robot are English. One might have expected Ford Prefect and Trillian to speak with British accents, but one would have been wrong. All in all, I think that all of the principles did a fine job. Martin Freeman was more than passable as the rumpled, confused, and overly cautious Dent. Mos Def seemed restrained in his portrayal of Ford, which was a major disappointment. Understanding the dynamic nature that the rapper brings to his musical performances, I expected more of that flair in his role as a universe-trotting journalist. It's tough to tell whether this is a function of the direction, the script, or the actor, in any case it was below expectations. Elf's Zooey Deschanel was typically charming as Tricia MacMillan, but there was certainly nothing memorable about her performance.The best of the major parts was turned in by veteran character actor Sam Rockwell, taking a Clinton-caricature approach to the role of Galaxy President Zaphod Beeblebrox. Rockwell was strong, as always, and sharp in both his verbal and physical comic delivery.Understanding that it is challenging, even daunting to take such a familiar text to the screen, I was impressed with many of the special effects and visuals. Having said that Karey Kirkpatrick's (James and the Giant Peach, Chicken Run, et al) screenplay fell short of capturing some of the important elements of the original text, while adding components that took the film in uncomfortable directions.The lesson here is one that Hollywood never seems to grasp, that some books are better left alone.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
465,imdb-10-jszlauko,I just don't get it!,1,28 October 2005,"Within 10 minutes I was getting the feeling that this movie was pure crap, and after another 20 minutes my feelings were confirmed! I then turned the movie off and wondered how I could have wasted $4 on this thing. I really just don't get it! This thing was rated 6.7, and being a real science fiction fan I figured I could kick back and enjoy it. However, I soon found myself completely lost in this mumble jumble charade of a film, and gave up. With the little time I wasted watching this fiasco, I was confused, insulted by the nonsense and in general didn't give a hoot what happened to anyone in this junk movie! Maybe it's me, but this thing wreaked!!!",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
466,RobZombie01930,Had me cracking up,9,30 April 2005,"Oh man I loved this film. I so wanted to hate it... I so wanted to disregard it. I wanted it to die! How dare they make a movie of such a good book! But, alas, I loved it. It had me cracking up, even if it did miss a few good chances at some jokes. Didn't really follow the book much, but from what I heard, it wasn't trying to. 8/10 for being a nice fun, family flick.Arthur and Trillian had a little bit more love in this story, The big computer had a woman's voice, and a few other weird things were added in, but most were pretty good. The horrible vogon poetry didn't work out that funny, but there were some great jokes... I just cracked up at some of them.""Peculiarly, the bowl of petunias only thoughts before it fell was 'Oh no, not again.' Some say that if we were to KNOW why the bowl of petunias had said such a thing, we would know much more about the universe today."" However, I'm not sure many people at my theater got the humour the movie was aiming at... I sometimes found myself the only one laughing, probably annoying the others around me.Anyhoo, I recommend this movie for a nice good time.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
467,Inspector_Tiger,Low expectations...,10,29 April 2005,"As a die-hard Hitchhiker fan, I went into this movie with low expectations. Having read the book so absorbingly, and having such a precise idea of the whole look of the situation, I expected the film to have gotten it all wrong.It didn't.It looked amazing. Not all of it was the way I pictured it, and they took some creative liberties on the characters, but aside from that, it's fantastic. I did, however, find Zaphod's second head a bit tedious, and the whole head-removal idea felt odd, but it worked well as a whole. One thing the book lacks is a proper villain, unless you count the automated greeting service on Magrathea. Humma Kavula fills this role nicely, although I would have liked to see more of him. The vogons are extremely realistic and believable as characters, and, remarkably, are (usually) not computer generated. The guide itself is beautifully illustrated, and Stephen Fry has just the right voice for it. It is also very funny.The dolphin song at the beginning is hilarious, the music is wonderful, the the plot is great, the effects are amazing, Marvin is gloomy; all in all, a wonderful film.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
468,Greenie123,Well worth the money,9,30 April 2005,"After going to see the movie at the cinema, I was pleasantly surprised at how well the filmmakers were able to maintain the humour and sarcasm of the book, and, while changing or removing certain plot points and shuffling things around, the movie generally comes out unscathed. The theatre I was in was absolutely packed to the brim with people, some of whom were even carrying towels! After the lights dimmed and the movie started, I was happy to see that the Douglas Adams-ish humour was retained, and that the rest of the audience, judging by the level of laughter, ""got it"".As there are synopses of the movie floating around all over the place, I won't go into detail here. The movie is well casted, and pretty well directed, especially for a first-time director. The only thing I disliked about the movie is that Sam Rockwell as Zaphod slightly overplayed his performance. Apart from that little thing, the movie was excellent. My closing words are: Go and see this movie, if not just to see dolphins singing! : )",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
469,paultp,Mostly Harmless,5,6 May 2005,"Now this film will polarise people as there are those who say it was good and reflects what Douglas Adams was after and people like me who were disappointed. Now that is weird as having just read his biography, I would suggest that even he did not quite know what he wanted. So what is good about the film? Well the effects are brilliant especially the making of earth. Marvin's revenge on the Vogons is brilliant and,the portrayal of the Vogons is also great and reminds me of our own wonderful bureaucracy. I have met people like that. What about the plot? Well the story has been tightened and condensed and has a beginning and an end and a very passé type of ending. One should not expect all the minutia that was present in the books, radio show or TV production and you won't be disappointed as you don't get it! Mores the pity as I think that was one of the crucial elements. No matter how tight the situation was one would get a lengthy excerpt from the book, most of which was useless but it screamed out to you ""Don't Panic!"" The lack of reference to the guide is a major flaw and without it taking prominence one might easily rename the film ""Arthur's big day out."" Overall the film takes itself a little too seriously and just does not have the zing I think typified the work of Douglas Adams. The actors played their roles with varying degrees of credibility. Arthur was near to great. I don't think he quite got the whingeing character across, but he was the reluctant hero who at least in the film comes up trumps - bit trite though. Ford, well the Prefect was not perfect, in fact he was woeful. He seemed totally disinterested in the whole thing. Good God he is supposed to be a well traveled young alien researching this zany guide. I suppose from the way he is portrayed here you can understand how his only contribution to the guide was "" mostly harmless."" Zaphod, well forget him. The two heads were done well but the character came across as dull, boring and of course stupid. But mostly stupid, too stupid for my taste and I wanted to fast forward his inane bits. He was just DULL. Trillion, was OK and the role explored her a bit focusing on a person trying to find herself. A brilliant mind in a pretty good body. Love my mind or love my body? A slightly different portrayal than the previous one, but perhaps a bit deeper. I do think Adams would have approved. Lastly Marvin. Well what can I say, it is so depressing , brain the size of a planet and can't act. It was good to see a cameo role by you know who, pity he was too expensive to reprise the role fully as that was excruciatingly depressing. So Marvin, fair, but could have had us all reaching for razor blades to slash our wrists. Oh the narrator, spot on for the very small part he played in this production. So long and thanks for all the fish. Flipper.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
470,rusheggie,Horrible,1,23 September 2005,"The books (by Douglas Admas) provided perfect material to follow for a great movie. Someone decided to make a really, really crappy movie instead. I recommend instead: reading the hitchhiker's books (or any of his other books), or listen to the radio show (you can still hear it on BBC online), the book on tape, even the old BBC TV show (which wasn't great, but still better than this!) . This is a total disappointment. The wit, creativity and intelligence of the books was eradicated. Dumbed-down and Hollywood-ized to an extent that it bore such a small resemblance to the source that it's mysterious that they even bothered to keep the title. I guess if I was forced at gunpoint to say one good thing about this movie... I might just have to get shot. Good books make good movies if they are about the books, not some bastardization and emasculation of the original.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
471,tricky1,Read the book instead! (mild spoilers),4,10 May 2005,"The HITCHIKERS GUIDE to the GALAXY (mild spoilers) made me think that its time to read the book again! Why do filmmakers even attempt to recreate good books and fall way off the mark! Maybe because of $$$$! Cause the radio & TV show (6 episodes), didn't do too badly, in fact the TV robot (which I liked better), and the original TV Arthur Dent (Simon Jones, who was also a close friend of the author, Douglas Adams) made brief cameos in the movie (Jones, as the hologram from Margaretha). Still with all the fancy CGI effects, and the neat and clever animation of the guide, even Zooey Deschandel's adorable face, did little to persuade me that the TV show was STILL better! I actually found a couple of episodes on video that I had recorded some time ago to confirm the above fact. With all the details and funny bits of the original, edited, trimmed, & repackaged (why did they put the dolphin bit at the very beginning? Ruining the wit and timing altogether!), just to make room to put some extra weird characters (John Malkovich's in particular), useless plot lines, and an unnecessary romance between Trillian (Zooey) & Arthur Dent (Martin Freeman), did more to bog the story down than explain it. I don't think there was a romance in the book, it was very one-sided at best, and thats what made it more witty and funny, cause Arthur was the odd human, and every other race in the galaxy looked down on the so called ""superior"" human race, as a bunch of upstarts. Zaphod (played by Sam Rockwell) was missing his second head (only to find it hiding under his collar), this made the funny head to head arguments almost impossible, and/or too expensive, so the only one argument was filmed with Zapods back to the audience. Eventually Humma Kavula (Malkovich) will save the animation costs and do some surgery (It would have been easier to take off the top one too!), this in essence does more to ruin Zaphod character, like it would of done to take out the Nazi alter ego in Dr Stranglove. As for the acting, it was more polished than the TV/radio show derivatives, proof positive that the content is more important than the delivery, as Hitchhiker can get barely off the ground than let alone travel eons in space. They could of at least arrived and ended in Milliweeds, the restaurant at the end of the galaxy, but I think Douglas Adams must have gotten senile and forget about putting that in his screenplay. So for people who hadn't read the book, disappointment, & for people that had, MORE disappointment! My best advice is read the book, which might be what that witty writer Adams had planned all along, or at worst he's rolling in his grave!",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
472,indigoharmony,Pleasantly Surprised,8,30 September 2005,"I didn't expect to like this movie, but I did. Granted, the humour wasn't as anarchic as Douglas Adams's is in the books/radio show, and there were bits that weren't in the books, and the ending seemed rather uncharacteristically optimistic...But what can I say? Forgive me for not being a purist, but to be honest I found the unexpected 'sweetness' of this movie rather welcome, as the doom and gloom humour in Hitchhikers always slightly depressed me, even if it is hilarious. (Paradoxical, but true). I also enjoyed the 'additional', non-canon scenes. Consider the movie as 'variations on a theme' rather than a strict re-telling. There was a very funny scene, for example, in which our friends land on the Vogon home planet. It wasn't Douglas Adams strictly, but was still funny and in the spirit of the man.I was also pleasantly surprised by all the cast. Had my doubts about Mos Def - I was worried that Ford Prefect would be made 'cool' but he wasn't at all. He portrayed Ford Prefect faithfully - the Ford Prefect I know and love even though he looks a bit different to how he did in the television series! All the other actors do a good job too - Alan Rickman is fantastic as the voice of Marvin, and I just love Bill Nighy as Slartibartfast.This movie also has some great visuals. I love the Vogons... Jim Henson's Creature Shop should be used much more often! So you may not like this if you are a die-hard Douglas Adams fan. I seem to have read a lot of reviews by such people who really don't like this adaptation. However I did like it - it's funny and enjoyable, with a lot of great moments and good portrayal of all the characters.

The only criticism i would have is cutting out the Ford Prefect non-ape-descendant joke and the babel fish being a dead giveaway that god exists, therefore he doesn't; QED.

(A tipical anaesthesia: stuck to one's youth experiences, ignoring and despising anything of the sort coming after.) They are disappointed and irritated by the fact that many things are omitted from, or altered in this version as compared to the original. THIS is really disappointing and irritating, a fundamentalism which opposes the whole philosophy of the HHGG.I've neither seen the BBC series, nor read the book, and I'm sure that these are also worth seeing / reading. Just as sure I am that this version embodies every crucial virtue of the original. Plus incomparably better in every visual effect.The BBC (1981) version has 9,323 ratings and 77 user reviews here on IMDb, and the 2005 version has 176,921 ratings and 1,080 reviews.

The film was visually good for film created in 2003. The plot was brilliant and the acting was incredible.The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is about Arthur Dent's adventure through space to find the meaning of life after earth was demolished by an alien construction crew.The atmosphere of the film, which was created with comedy, made it light-hearted despite what it's about. The characters were lovable, I cried when I thought Marvin was broken beyond repair and I found Zaphod very amusing.At the end, I was rather disappointed. I was hoping that they would find the meaning of life as I am sure everyone was. Although I think that it was necessary to leave it at a cliffhanger. No one knows what the meaning of life is and it wasn't in Douglas Adam's discretion to decide.

I'll never repeat the experience of hearing those bitterly funny words for the first time, but, considering what a disaster the movie version could have been, I'm pleased. I like Trillian's greater role and do believe it came from Adams himself, though I'm not so sure about the romantic ending. It just doesn't seem cynical enough. On the other hand, Douglas Adams himself was very happily married.I especially loved Marvin. Just before seeing the film, I happened to see ""Galaxy Quest"" on TV and was reminded of Alan Rickman's wonderfully dark style. He was the perfect choice for the voice of Marvin. Bill Nighy was perfect as Slartibartfast and deserved a much bigger role. Some of the visual elements looked washed out, especially the interior of the Heart of Gold.

Everyone in the cast gives an inspired performance with Sam Rockwell the clear standout as the President of the Galaxy, sinking his teeth into a very over the top roll with panache.It's worth noting if you're not a fan of Monty Python or of Terry Gilliam's Time Bandits this is not the film for you.

Nowadays the humor can be found in many different ways similar (Dilbert), always dealing with the complexity of systems and how bureaucracy can erase all the joy of life and many things else. So therefore sorry to say, but no actor can be as lovable as the originals characters I had in my mind before. They can try, but I think they will have a very difficult time. Therefore despite of all of the good efforts I prefer the book. But still I can say, the crew deserves respect.

484,compwitch,Adams must be spinning in his grave,2,28 April 2005,"Firstly, if you're an Adams fan, don't, please don't waste your money on this travesty, for it is a savaging of Adams' work which must have him spinning in his grave like a catherine wheel. I was (un)fortunate enough to have free tickets to a preview screening last night, and I had honestly been looking forwards to it, and went with an open mind. Five minutes into the film, my mind was beginning to shut down, from sheer despair.To start with (oh Gods, where to start? ), all of Adams' witty dialogue has been excised, and replaced with truly lame one-liners and slapstick. (Yes, you can definitely see the Disney influence.)All of that wonderful nonsense which made the radio series, and the books, and the TV version, what they were has disappeared forever into the void. The story, as we know it, has also been savaged to the extent that whilst most of the main characters remain - broadly - the same, you might be forgiven for thinking you had mistakenly wandered into a screening of Galaxy Quest meets Spaceballs. Whatever it is, it is NOT Adams.Gone is the excellent exchange between Arthur and Mr. Prosser, gone is the philosophy of the towel, gone Milliways, and Disaster Area, and the B Ark, and don't even ask me about the Infinite Improbability Drive! Instead, we have slapstick and a level of humour which might have been OK for The Love Bug, but is sadly deficient for this material.There are three redeeming features which enabled me to give the film a rating of two (rather than a negative score), namely: Mos Def's performance as Ford Prefect, which, given the bathetic level of the script, was excellent.Bill Nighy's portrayal of Slartibartfast, which was, IMHO, even better than Richard Vernon's.The whole Magarathea shuttle sequence, which is visually stunning, and easily the best part of the film.Sadly, these were mostly effaced by the film's defects, and as a lifelong (his, not mine) Sam Rockwell appreciator, all I can say is, ""Sam, less is more"". It's easily his worst performance ever. On the whole, with the exception of the three caveats above, I would expect anyone who had a hand in the production of this film to be deeply, deeply ashamed of what they've done to one of the funniest works of fiction ever produced. Lets leave aside the utter mangling of Adams' philosophy, and the fact that the director completely missed all the salient points of this, the film JUST AIN'T FUNNY. Hardly a ripple of laughter disturbed the silence of the cinema last night, and people leaving afterwards exhibited the same shell-shocked expression that I'm sure was plastered on my face.I left the cinema feeling that something precious had been utterly despoiled ( not helped admittedly, by the fact that the ""opening"" of the M77 had meant travelling both ways at 7mph).

485,Ofanite_of_Destiny,Paradoxically Good,8,4 May 2005,"How can a script so unlike the original ""Hitchhiker's Guide"" radio show and miniseries still come off feeling so much like its predecessors? I'm not sure, but I have no doubt that it's due in no small part to the genius of the late Douglas Adams. When one steps back and thinks, it's disturbing how few of the story's famous quips, lines and jokes actually made it into the movie; in fact, reviewers elsewhere on the Net had already been cataloging the ""missing in action"" material for weeks before its premiere. And some of the story's familiar elements were weirdly transformed in the journey to the big screen. But...Somehow, even with everything that was excised or changed the movie is still undeniably, unmistakably ""The Hitchhiker's Guide"". The flavor is the same, the chemistry is the same -- even though it looks like it ought to fall apart from accumulated bad production decisions, the whole thing not only holds together, it succeeds admirably. It tells the familiar story, it gets its laughs, it takes you a few new places you didn't expect, and at the end you come out of it feeling both pleased and surprised.I recommend this film highly.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

I have been meaning to watch it since it came out but it always disappeared into the back of my head only to resurface now and then. After seeing it, all I can say is it wasn't the hype I remember it having. When it first came back in the spring of 2005, I remember seeing all the TV spots and trailer online that made it the biggest movie event of the year (which it wasn't because ""Revenge of the Sith"" and ""The Goblet of Fire"" took those titles). And I'm glad i didn't waste any money seeing this. First off I have never read the book or seen the TV series so this is from some one completely unfamiliar with Douglas Adam. The premise of the film is a good one. It starts off with an average Joe known as Arthur Dent whom his house is being demolished and soon finds out the whole planet will be as well. Earth gets destroyed and Arthur and his friend Ford find their way to a ship being driven by the king of the Galaxy along with Arthur's former interest, as well as the mega depressed Robot, Marvin. From there on they go about on a adventure that wasn't really specified to begin with, in fact changed from one scene to another. There was one scene where the king leaves his second head with a rival but then never gets mentioned for the rest of the film. The humor was good here and there, nothing over the top in most comedies these days, but nothing really special or memorable. The villains didn't seem as menacing and were hard to be taken seriously. I was actually confused what they wanted or why they were chasing the main characters. The ending of the film left me with a dry feeling. I did not get why or how and I wasn't even sure the movie ended until the credits started appearing. A lot of things weren't explained and left out, which made it really hard for me to enjoy the film. Like I said I haven't read the book or watched the series but I can see why a lot of those that did were very disappointed by this movie. The characters were not the memorable type especially the King character whom I immediately disliked when I first saw him. Marvin although intended to be some sort of comic relief was not at all relevant to the plot, or whatever was the plot. As beautiful the effects were (they always are), the confusing plot and unremarkable characters drag this film down.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
488,citybuilder9,"This Movie is Good, Really Good...",10,29 April 2005,"You just won't believe how amazingly good it is. I mean, you might think the TV series was good, but that just peanuts to the movie. Listen... But seriously, the story, the casting, the music, the effects: all spot on. Many complained about the added story elements, but they all made sense and invoked some of the funniest moments in the film, such as the POV Gun scene in which Zaphod, acting like Ford says ""Hitchhiking is fun. Towels are good."" and Humma Kavula's sermon ending, not with ""Amen"" but ""Achoo"". The casting was great. Mos Def was even better than the guy on the TV show. Martin Freeman showed us an Arthur we never saw. Sam Rockwell was also great in his role as Zaphod, who now seems to show more of his roots as an ex-hippie. They were all real hoopy. On the music: Holy Zarquon's Singing Fish. The opening credits featured a song that I'm still humming even now and the remix of ""Journey of the Sorceror"" will blow your brains out. The effects were amazing for such a low budget. They looked more realistic than some of the ionospherically budgeted FX films that guys like Spielberg are rolling out. I really have to give props to the guys who designed the Vogons. They are incredibly realistic and seemed to me to be the best creature work I've seen for a while. To summarize: See this movie.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

The third thirty minutes I didn't enjoy at all. After that it went into a bit of decline.The film adaptation was just ghastly. Absolutely ghastly. Just don't even talk about it. It really hurt my eyes and now they're all red.The acting was as good as the direction, which was awful.I bet they're making a sequel. Why stop now just when I'm hating it?But I don't suppose you'll be very interested in knowing all of this.Life's bad enough as it is without wanting to invent any more of it.Life, don't talk to me about life.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
490,alan-potter-1,Mostly harmless...,7,14 May 2005,"I saw this today, along with my 13 yr old daughter. She hasn't read the books or heard the original radio series (I have) so we have different takes on it. She thought it was hilarious, I thought it was funny in parts but has obviously been modified so that it appeals more to the American market. The Vogon costumes are excellent and Marvin is awful. I saw a production of HHGTTG at the Rainbow theatre and Marvin was spot on. A camp guy in a silver suit with ridiculous epaulets who limped and sulked like a teenager. A stupid robotty thing whose only expressions were slightly shrugged shoulders and a drooping head didn't work for me. And neither did Alan Rickman. Normally I love his stuff but in this film he sounded like he wasn't interested in the role (rather than being a disinterested cyborg) and was doing it as a very bad voice-over.Slartibartfast was good.Before I put the spoilers in, I would just say that it's okay as a film but not much more. I did laugh out loud occasionally but that's about it.<< SPOILER ALERT!!!>> First gripe: WTF is the point of the visit to the planet with the church on? The book didn't need it, and apart from having Mr. Malkovitch added to the cast list to add to attendance, I could see no point. They're obviously hoping to do a sequel but even so...Who the hell was the women hanging around with the Vogons who ended up snogging Zaphod? Why did there have to be a romance between Arthur and Trillian/Trish? It really didn't matter (after all - he only talked to her for about ten minutes at a party before Zaphod nicked her) and the whole romance theme throughout the film was boring, hackneyed and irrelevant. Oh - and unconvincing.Then we come to Zaphod... Was this a really low budget movie? Or did they decide to spend more money on Vogon costumes than they did on Zaphod? I thought the realisation of him was the stupidest I've seen. It just didn't work. The third arm appeared twice, the second time in the poorest quality CGI (it would have been better to get someone to stick their up his shirt) and having the head kept as a hostage was such a pathetic attempt at budget minimisation.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
491,Partofthevoid,oh well,5,1 May 2005,"I really expected something special with all the positive reviews I'd seen, but in the end it was just kinda blah. The characters weren't quite right...Arthur was less outraged and confused than he shoulda been, Trillian was all emotional, and Zaphod was not so much crazy as he was a complete idiot. Ford was about right, but he wasn't consistently funny. I love the hitchhiker's guide. The book remains a fond memory of when I was little, but this isn't a fitting tribute to it or Douglass Adams. I can only hope that a sequel is made with better direction and people thinking more about the characters and the dialogue. I think that it is fine visually, but the acting and script was killing me. I still urge people to see it; there are some scenes in these books that I would pay to see put on screen, and there is very little chance that anyone can mess up source material as good as the Hitchhiker's books.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
492,JamesFord92,Good.....but not great,7,30 April 2005,"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is definitely worth seeing if you are already a big Douglas Adams fan. You can go see it and decide for yourself if it lives up to the quality of the books. My comments are mostly for people who are seeing the movie without having read the books.I myself am a big Hitchhiker's fan, but I went to the movie with two of my friends who had never even heard of Douglas Adams. They left the movie looking very confused and were asking me questions about the movie the whole subway ride home. Even I had trouble keeping up, as after the first 20-30 minutes the movie barely had anything to do with the book. If you are a hitchhiking for the first time you will probably leave the the movie theater, as my friends did, amused by some funny jokes and good acting, but also very confused.Now you are probably asking why I gave this a 7 and not a 4 or a 5. For one almost all the acting was very good. I especially liked Mos Def as the alien Ford Prefect. I also liked Martin Freeman as Arthur Dent and Zooey Deschanel as Trillian. Alan Rickman was also great as Marvin the depressed robot.It was also good that they decided to use puppets for most of the aliens in the movie instead of using Star Wars- like computer generated aliens. I just wish that they had used more hitchhikers's guide entries in the movie. Those were the funniest parts of the books for me.If you have already read the books you should enjoy this movie and if you have not you will enjoy it in different ways",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
493,g_alan_e,"Almost, but not quite, exactly unlike...",8,4 May 2005,"...any previous version.I really liked the movie, especially the new stuff. Visually, it's an eye candy shop where everything is free.Where it fell down for me was the bits where they used dialog word for word from the books or TV series, but left out the best lines! The Vogon poetry scene loses its punch without ""Actually, I write poetry to throw my cold, callous exterior into sharp relief!"" and the Arthur lying in front of the bulldozer scene is lacking in humor with a bunch of hilarious dialog condensed into one line about the cellar. Could they not at least have done this? ""I had to go down to the cellar, with a torch!"" ""Perhaps the lights had gone?"" ""So had the stairs!"".This movie spends great tracts of time (which is an illusion, lunchtime doubly so) on visuals, crowding out the dialogs that are what make the Guide series so funny and fun-poking at the human condition.Overall, the movie just skims the surface of the depths found in the original radio series, the books and even the TV series.But no matter what, see the movie, especially if you've never experienced any other version. Then grab an omnibus version of the trilogy (which contains five books plus a short story) and explore the even deeper realms of Douglas Adams humor.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
494,marknovack,"Disappointed, just another ""cult"" classic",3,30 October 2005,"There is plenty here written on the movie so I'll refrain and simply give my entertainment opinions. Very little. If you are a fan of this subject since you were young, then don't miss this opportunity to complete your circle of HGTTG media. If you are a big sci-fi fan wanting to see a film billed as sci-fi, then pass this one by. It took me three sessions to get through the film...it put me to sleep. Obviously, its a film for those who know the characters from the novel and want to see the characters put to life on the big screen. There was a funny part but it was so quick that I don't even remember what it was. The best part of the film for me was the dolphins singing the introductory title in a typical Broadway fashion of ""music over the top"". Definitely a ""fans"" movie and not for general entertainment in this viewer's opinion. Children should find it thrilling with the strange alien characters regardless of the plot as it plays somewhat like a Disney film only with less motion and plot. I give it a five only because there are many more worse films more deserving of 1's, 2's, 3's, or 4's.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
495,chunuk_bair,Could Have Been So Much More,7,11 May 2005,"Let your reviewer first point out that he has not actually read the book the movie is based on. From memory, he did read it from a library about fifteen years ago, but it did not make enough of an impression to either buy or remember much from. Therefore any changes from the book to the movie, as have been mentioned in other reviews, will not be dissected below.There is something about the British sense of humour, almost anarchic, that is so different to the overwhelming Hollywood version of the phrase. Only the Brits could have done Monty Python, the Goodies, and the Young Ones. Or, as in this movie, created a depressed robot, made galactic elections as bouncy, peppy and cheesy as the Eurovision Song Contest, and make poetry reading a form of torture.The acting is pretty good as well, with Martin Freeman as Arthur Dent doing a suitably bemused person who has just had his planet destroyed, being changed into all sorts of things in hyperspace due to the improbability drive, Mos Def and Sam Rockwell are great as drinking buddies Ford Prefect and pompous Galactic President, and Alan Rickman provides further comedic relief. Zooey Deschanel as Trillian doesn't get much beyond wide eyed pretty though, and I am not sure why John Malkovich was called in to play such a minor, almost cameo, role.The main gripe with Hitchhiker's though is that although it does certain parts of itself well, it doesn't seem to be able to pull the strands together to provide any sort of central core to the movie that most audiences would care about. The comedy, good in parts, is patchy overall, the sci fi is covered by well we are in space and there are aliens around, and the romance, what there is of it, underwhelms the rest of the movie.If you want British sci fi comedy at its best, rent or buy Red Dwarf. What could have been Monty Python does Star Wars tries to cover too many bases and loses at most of them. Much more a typical popcorn movie than should have been expected.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
496,Yukle,This movie knows where its towel is,5,3 May 2005,"The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy has this to say on the subject of this movie: You may be hesitant to see this movie at all. After all, many people remain faithful to the radio series, read the books cover to cover a squillion times and think the TV series was alright. First, the bad news. Even putting aside the poor way Zaphod's two heads and three arms were portrayed, Sam Rockwell just isn't a Beeblebrox. Many of the jokes, including the popular entry on Vogons in the guide, were left uncompleted from the original stories and so weren't as funny. Now, the good news. Stephen Fry was the book. Really, he WAS the book. Martin Freeman did such a good job, that Arthur Dent could pass off as a real person. The Warwick Davis/Alan Rickman Marvin was simply tremendous and could not have been done better.

Luckily, the man who wrote the book actually had his hands deep in the writing of the movie and he knew exactly what he wanted. Douglas Adams' contributions to this film made it what it should have been, though was still a bit disappointing to the bigger fans of the book. Some of the added scenes were unnecessary and really didn't help to carry the story any further or make it richer in any way. The scenes were still funny and definitely had Adams' goofy touch. I definitely enjoyed the movie, especially the richer characters (Marvin, Zaphod) but the movie lacked any kind of depth or explanation for the characters.

There is one impressive visual sequence when Arthur is given a tour of the ""factory"" but, that's about it. And his neurotic inability to make decisions during a crisis got very tiring very quickly. One saving grace is the extremely cute female co-star, Zooey Deschanel. If you're a fan of action movies, wait for the DVD on this one.

I don't believe those in charge of this production of THHGTTG ""got it,"" however. Most of the charm of the Hitchhiker's franchise is in the dialog and the fact that Douglas Adams could see and describe just how absurd normal everyday things can be when looked at from a different perspective. There were quite a few scenes that could have been much funnier and more than once I waited for a punchline that didn't come. The material was already there, it just had to be used.For example, in the movie there is a scene where Trillian takes Arthur to the kitchen to get him a cup of tea. They stand in front of a machine that fills a glass with a liquid that looks like it would taste quite bad. Arthur tastes it and grimaces. Trillian laughs and says that she's sorry and that she knows it isn't very good and only kind of resembles tea. (Of course, all Hitchhiker fans know the line should have been ""It tastes almost, but not quite exactly, unlike tea."") They then waste two minutes explaining (again) why Arthur blew it with Trillian back on Earth and poke fun at Star Wars with a very lame sight gag. Then Zaphod calls Trillian and Arthur to the bridge of the Heart of Gold due to an emergency.This is more along the lines of what I expected: We join the scene from ""The Restaurant at the End of the Universe"" after Arthur's sixth very unsuccessful attempt at explaining tea to the Nutri-matic.NUTRI-MATIC: Share and Enjoy. ARTHUR: Oh, shut up! NUTRI-MATIC: Will that be all? ARTHUR: No. Look, it's very simple...All I want...is a cup of tea. You are going to make one for me. Keep quiet and listen.Arthur then tells the Nutrimatic about India, China and Ceylon. He tells it about broad leaves drying in the sun. He tells it about silver teapots and summer afternoons on the lawn. He even tells it (briefly) about the East India Company.NUTRI-MATIC: So, that's it, is it? ARTHUR: Yes. That is what I want. NUTRI-MATIC: You want the taste of dried leaves boiled in water? ARTHUR: Er, yes. With milk. NUTRI-MATIC: Squeezed out of a cow? ARTHUR: Well, in a manner of speaking I suppose...

But, with Spaceballs, it was more of a parody of the Star Wars saga. Now by venturing back to The Hitchhiker's Guide to the galaxy what I found interesting was the commentator who spoke throughout the film; explaining the universe and what our fellow characters were up to and saying a few goofy things here and there. The movie itself was a bit weird and made me cock my head right and left throughout the movie. I did, however; like the story-line of the film and the way everything turned out such as the costumes, stage sets, and etc. The music I found was really fun to tag along with and as weird as the film I just had to finish it and I might even consider watching it here and there.

Hollywood had great special effects and not much else, as it often does. Since half the humor of H2G2 is in the dinginess and incompetence or the entire universe, good SFX was actually a detriment.There are other problems, as well. Douglas Adams was quite dead by the time it came out, so a lot of ideas that would have probably been quite funny in his hands wound up as nothing but a whole sort of general mishmash. Some of the casting was at odds with the book descriptions, as opposed to the BBC version whose casting was so uncannily perfect that I suspect they were the people the characters were based upon.Tl;dr: watch the miniseries instead.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

It really seemed that, almost without exception, just about every part that I had remembered being essential to a faithful adaptation of the book was included.

While the effects are obviously much better than the BBC series, the characters (with perhaps the exception of Arthur Dent on occasion) failed to really capture the true feel you get when you read the book. I would argue that the film was a little too Americanized and tried to fit too much into a formulaic Hollywood comedy sci-fi mold.

507,Krud-2,"So sad that it should come to this... we tried to warn you all, but oh dear...",7,29 April 2005,"Hearing those words being sung over the closing credits felt incredibly ironic to me.I gave this movie 7 out of 10. Why? Because I love Douglas Adams' work, and there was enough of it intact within the movie to skew my overall opinion of the film.However, if I were not a fan, and if I had just come into this movie without knowing what was going on, I think I would have more likely given it a 3 or 4.I generally do not like live action Disney movies. The only exception that I can think of is ""Pirates Of The Caribbean"". And while technically HHGG was under their ""Touchstone"" label, it was still, ultimately a Disney film. It was only Adams' source material that made it at all bearable. (Though in many cases, that source material was hardly recognizable.) I knew not to have overly high expectations, and that movie adaptations of existing works (whether book, radio, television, or what have you) tend to not work out the way fans would like. Still, I was expecting a ""revisioning"" along the lines of the Harry Potter movies, or perhaps the Lord Of The Rings movies.Not even close.I should have heeded the warning signs when I discovered that they were going to play up the ""love triangle"" between Arthur, Trillian, and Zaphod. (Though technically it's a V, not a triangle, unless there's some deleted footage involving Arthur and Zaphod that I'm unaware of, but let's hope not.) And maybe it's just me, but I didn't see what it accomplished to add two new characters to the mix. What exactly did Questular and Hummulah Kuvulah (or however it's spelled) accomplish, plot-wise? They took up precious time that could have been better spent on things like, for example, actually FINISHING punchlines, like the ending of the poetry reading, where the Vogon is supposed to say, ""Well, you're wrong, I only write poetry to throw my callous exterior into sharp relief."" But they skip over that and go straight to the airlock bit. And even that was far less amusing than in previous incarnations.And sometimes, even when a classic line was delivered, the boom mike wasn't close enough, or sound effects obscured it, or the actor mumbled, so the joke was lost anyway, unless you happened to already know the joke, but by that logic you could just have them do pantomime and have the fans call out the dialogue. I'd hate for it to turn into a Rocky Horror Picture Show.I understood that they couldn't include all the ""favorite lines"", but why add all-new, inane ones? I'd quote an example, but they were so forgettable that I can't recall one.Some positive points: great visual effects, sweeping soundtrack, good casting, and fairly coherent camera-work.Perhaps the most distressing thing about the whole experience for me, however, is that Disney did so much tweaking, that if they were to make a sequel (which the ending practically screamed for), it will be even further removed from any version Adams created. (And yes, I know he was always proud of how they all contradict each other. But where they contradicted, they were still funny. The new contradictions... aren't.) Anyway, I might change my tune a bit when it comes out on DVD, but only if they do a Peter Jackson number on it and restore scenes that I'm hoping were cut at the last minute (and not in the screen writing stage.) Douglas deserved much better. Anyway, I need to go find my towel.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

510,lechman@mac.com,Disappointed,4,30 April 2005,"Sad. Very sad. I just saw it. Hitchhiker is my bible, I've read it for almost 20 years over and over again, I carry the ebook around with me on my Palm. This was not what I expected. As I write this, I'm playing the BBC version in the background to heal my soul. FIRST: Mos Def as Ford Prefect is bad. He makes Hayden Christenson look like Brando. Why Hollywood continues to cast third-rate rappers in hopes of finding the next Ice-T is beyond me. And not only did they seriously miscast Ford, but they took one of the wittiest, boldest and most dynamic characters in the series and whittled him down to a mumbling, uninteresting bore with no real agenda. ""Neutered"" is the word I'm looking for here. In short, this guy is no David Dixon. SECOND: Sam Rockwell is not bad, I've seen him do better (see Galaxy Quest) and I was counting on him to carry the rest of the weak cast. The way they handled the second head was just plain stupid. It's 2005; if we can digitally render thousands of bumbling Gungans battling an army of idiot droids, why can't Zaphod have two heads? Yes, I know the producers of the BBC version toyed with a head-on-head idea back in '81, but I think there's a reason that they didn't end up going that way. Again, we have a great main character who becomes diluted for the mass movie audience. THIRD: Far too much of the film seems to have hit the cutting floor. Zaphod seems to have been romantically involved with, Questular Rontok, the female in league with the Vogons. She seemed to care deeply about him, yet we never learn why. Arthur and Ford go down to the pub for beer and peanuts just like they did in the book, but I can't recall anyone ever explaining about the beer being a muscle relaxant. It could be speculated that the pointless and abrupt inclusion of Humma Kavula and for that matter, that all of the untied plot threads were setups for potential sequels. However, there were just too many instances of open- endedness to suggest that they were all intentional. The word I'm looking for here is ""rushed."" By the way, my personal opinion of the sequels is that they won't happen. If they do, then I'm afraid that enough has changed in the first film from the book, that any sequel made from this particular version of the story would hardly be recognizable to the fans. Think two divergent lines that continue on forever, always getting farther apart. So much of ""Restaurant"" depends on the first book and so what was changed for the ""Hitchhiker's"" film will directly affect what is changed in its sequel. FOURTH: Many jokes and one-liners were cut short by tight editing or seemed to have been thrown in at the last second into any available pause in the action. So even though at least a third of the humor was left in, it didn't always have the impact that it should - I think a previous poster noted that there just weren't many real laughs in the movie. I agree - I went to see the film with four other people - three of them fell asleep. FIFTH: On that same note, where was the biting and slightly dark satire from the book? Where was ""the secret is to bang the rocks together, guys!"" or Ford's cruel joke on Arthur when they're about to be thrown out of the Vogon airlock? This movie was a sanitized version of the book - full of hope, promise & love (three things things the first two novels weren't really about) made by people who underestimate the American public's potential to appreciate something other than the same safe tripe that we've been getting for years. Although I appreciated and was somewhat surprised at the film's inclusion of the Oolon Colluphid's ""God"" trilogy, I get the feeling that too many cooks spoiled the pot. Someone wanted a romantic comedy, someone wanted the clever one-liners, someone wanted a sci-fi blockbuster, etc. Think ""unfocused."" SIXTH: Overall, the cast was poor and the characters were dull. Sam Rockwell HAD to be mugging all the time otherwise I would have fallen asleep too. Marvin was trimmed down to the point that when he got shot, no one cared - he wasn't vital enough to the plot to have his character spend some time endearing himself to the audience. Trillian was a pale shadow of the strong, intelligent female character that she was in the novels and Arthur wasn't nearly as distressed or neurotic as we all know him to be. Slartibartfast, however, was interesting although slightly different from what I had expected. And while he was definitely a high point in the film, I preferred the Slartibartfast from the BBC version. Well, I could go on and on and on, but those are my major gripes. What could have been a fitting testament to a brilliant writer and a fantastic and intelligent satire became Hollywood special-effects fodder. I could tell that at least some of the people behind this film wanted to do it right - that does come through when you watch it. But in the end the Hitchhiker movie is a shallow plate serving up way more bones than meat.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
511,b_muse,"Not bad, but not wonderful either",6,15 May 2005,"Well, on the upside, I didn't need to be carried out of the theatre on a stretcher after doing too much indignant tutting and huffing. Bits of it were quite good, sharp and funny, such as Neil Hannon's dolphin song, Bill Bailey as the whale, the kitsch Guide graphics, Stephen Fry's jolly Stephen Fry-esquire voice-over, Alan Rickman as Marvin's voice (if you know me, you will know how much this will have pleased me), the factory floor and Bill Nighy as Slarti, the not thinking slappy pads, the white mice ('bollocks'), the fact they kept a bit of the original music in the beginning and the cameo of the original Marvin in the queue. I laughed. I also laughed along with the section of the audience who knew when the jokes were coming before they'd even got there.However, there were also a couple of things very wrong with this film. And, before I get shouted down for being a snobby purist elitist H2G2 fan who refuses to accept the fact that it is a constantly evolving story and has been incarnated differently in many different versions yada yada yada, let me just say I knew it was never going to be my perfect adaptation, and had resigned myself to that.My bones with it were that it just wasn't a very good film, on a purely taking it as a film level. The plot was sketchy and dragged in places, and at times seemed like a series of anecdotal bits just tacked together. I mean, what was all that stuff with the runner up President of the galaxy Malkovich dude? How did that add to the plot at all? Although the POV gun was a great bit of comedy, surely that could have been added in without all that irrelevant story? Also, the whole Vogon chase thing got boring very quickly, and although I love Anna Chancellor, I think more could have been made of her, or she should have been scrapped altogether.And the showdown with the mice was rubbish. ""I love her I love her I loooove her."" The whole point is that he doesn't get her  that nothing ever happens. And not only does he get her, it also proves on of the cheesiest pivotal moments in a film I've ever seen. Arthur himself (again, love Martin Freeman but just not here) was just wet, without enough of an irascible sarcastic edge to redeem him.I think this showdown sums up what was wrong with this film  they were trying to fit this bizarre, quintessentially English wordy, wry, cynical story into a traditional Hollywood summer blockbuster mould, where love conquers all, humour is brief, slapstick and in your face (hence the cutting of some of the wordier jokes) and characters are only given a couple of traits to identify them, which are then played off for the whole film. And the two don't mix very well at all. If I hadn't known the radio series/books/TV show inside out, I still think I wouldn't have been that blown away by this film.I guess all I want to say is that with the extensive material they had, they could have done better to make this film a more cohesive triumph, instead of 'fun but forgettable.' There were parts of this film which show what it could have been, but parts of it also that really let it down. I know Douglas Adams was involved with the script before he passed away, but I wonder how different it would have been had he still been around to see it through. I liked the dedication at the end though. Nice touch.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

The atmosphere of the books doesn't come across. The acting of especially Zaphod and Ford are pretty lousy and the jokes don't come over properly. Only the roles of Marvin and Arthur Dent characters are believable. I can't understand why the book has been mutated so much. The film is just much too short to tell the story right and it leaves it viewers confused at the end. This doens't means that it is a bad film.

The Vogons became the Galactic police force it seems, Deep Thought changed into a woman, Arthur Dent became a babe magnet, Zaphod Beeblebrox was in reality a very clever person who had to divide his brain to become the President? To cap it all they remade the Earth exactly as it was before the Vogons destroyed it, why? Where was all the wonderful dialog? Half the characters were missing, the rest were mere shadows of what they should have been.

I understand that it has to be dumbed down for the American market but this is really really awful when compared to the original.

518,MadProphet,Don't Panic: This movie is excellent (Minor SPOILERS),9,1 May 2005,"To all Adamites who are worried about the faithfulness to the books and quality in this movie, I say this; don't panic. ""Shaun of the Dead"" was probably the best British comedy I had ever seen before this, but it's now almost been supplanted by this. For all who are new to this shebang, Earthman Arthur Dent's homes are destroyed. First his house, then the Earth itself. Having escaped the Earth by hitchhiking onto one of the spaceships that destroyed the Earth, he finds out that his best friend Ford Prefect is an alien from Betelguese, not a human from Guildford. But Ford is not just that. He's also a researcher for a universal repository of all knowledge and wisdom and the greatest book ever written, ""The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy."" The set pieces are so surreal, you may find yourself almost disoriented by them. The most notable example of this is the materialization and death of a very surprised looking sperm whale. Hilariously voiced by Bill Bailey, it wonders, among other things, if the ground will be friends with it, before he hits the ground and dies. But the surreality of this movie is evident right from the beginning as the Earth's dolphins sing a song called ""So Long and Thanks for All the Fish"" before flying into space. It's an inspired opening sequence that's not only reminiscent of Monty Python, but it will also have the song stuck in viewers' heads for weeks after the film is released.After this, the film moves swiftly on, leaving you with two hours to try and get the song out of your head and introducing Arthur before the Earth is destroyed. Martin Freeman's Arthur is just right, because he's an English everyman, just as the character is. Simon Jones' Arthur in the other incarnations of the story just seems too posh to be like that. In regards to acting, the best performances come from Mos Def as the revoltingly cool Ford Prefect, Sam Rockwell as the Elvis-Bush hybrid President Zaphod Beeblebrox and Alan Rickman voicing Marvin, the manically depressed robot of the Heart of Gold. Zooey Deschanel also gives a solid performance as Trillian and, as mentioned earlier, Bill Bailey's voice cameo is hilarious.The TV series is referenced here in several cameos, most markedly Simon Jones as the Magrathean announcer and an appearance from the Marvin of the TV series, (when Arthur sees this Marvin, he double takes) which should keep purists of the story happy. Not that they need it anyway, because this film is wholly remarkable and it should do the same for British comedy as ""Shaun of the Dead"" did this time last year. This is an early contender for my favourite film of the year.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
519,KathyAndPaul,Hmmmm.....,7,13 May 2005,"KATHY: I liked this, but not as much as I Liked the TV series. Basically everything was here but some of the original better jokes were missing. There were a couple of cameo performances - Arthur Dent appeared as a hologram and the original Marvin robot was in the queue of aliens in he Vogon waiting room - which were good to see but the rest of this film I found to be unexceptional. The main interest for me was to see how the film was made to someone else's perception of the original. The best part of the film for me was the journey of Arthur and Slartybartfast through the workshop(s) of Magrathea. In summary, this was an ordinary film, well worth seeing but not amusing in itself. 7 Out Of 10 PAUL: I (unlike someone not 1,000 miles away) was expecting the film to veer slightly off from the radio/TV series/books as each of those versions contradicted itself.However it veered WILDLY off course. In fact the movie strays a little too much for my liking.Dull set pieces involving new material wind up pushing some of the best comedy material out the way. The hilarious Babel Fish V's God argument is dropped for one.Then there is the guide itself. On radio the guide always had an amusing tale to tell. On TV the guide did likewise with some hilarious animation. Alas here the guide (voiced brilliantly by Stephen Fry) becomes more of a narator than anything. And very few slices of the actual guide are used. Which is a pity as the few we are treated to are well done (I liked the animation).Alan Rickman does a decent enough job handling Marvin's vocals. But I'm sorry there will only ever be ONE Marvin...Stephen Moore who played the character on Radio, Television AND audio book format is sorely missed here.There is a LOT of good to be found in THHGTTG. The acting has nothing too hammy about it and the special effects are good. But alas there is too much that doesn't work here that the film cannot raise much above average.

As usual in a book to movie transformation, many things were left out and some were added. What was left out was the humor and satire. What was added was a waste of film.In the attempt to add a plot to the story, the original book was tossed out. Many important facts were left out (how did Ford and Arthur get on the Vogon ship if they don't pick up hitchhikers?) and others were glossed over (the improbability drive and the whale come to mind)Spend your money on something more worthwhile, like a root canal.

I even have a nephew with a website that refers to Arthur's experience of tea aboard the Heart of Gold. I had read reviews of this movie from the uninitiated and had moderate hopes of the flick. Did I like it? Was it true to my vision of the end of world as we know it and the hyperspace bypass as we know it? I'll tell you how much I liked th movie. I was meditating at the end of yoga class this morning, sealing my practice with a few minutes in sivasana, the corpse pose, and my serene brain kept revisiting the scenes of the film, esp Zooey Deschanel being lowered into the pit of the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast and the rather handsome afternoon tea put on for the returning travelers. I also envisioned the image of the white rose and the British robin as the backup earth is being fitted for deployment. That's serene.A modest, unassuming, incredibly funny and VERY satisfying treatment of the four part trilogy.

522,Rob11086,A Review from someone who hasn't read the book.,9,24 October 2008,"Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy is a very... Odd Film. Is it good? Yes. Is it fantastic? No. Is it entertaining? Very.Though the film itself isn't Oscar worthy by any means, it gets the job done very well. It's funny and well acted, and it's a beautiful film full of nice special effects. The film is very creative as well, and not having read the book, I absolutely love the humor in it. There is a scene where a whale very suddenly appears and has a very short time to figure things out. This monologue of sorts epitomizes the type of humor in the film- British and somewhat slapstick (No Pun Intended). It's funny and doesn't take it to the point where it comes across as stupid. All the slapstick is there for a reason.Acting wise, the film is strong. The better characters of the film come from Mos Def's portrayal of Ford Perfect and Sam Rockwells Portrayal of Zaphod Beeblebrox, who sounds a little too much like our ""esteemed"" president, W. The weaker acting however, comes from Zooey Deschanel, who while is good looking, is very stiff in her part. Martin Freeman's portrayal of Arthur Dent whines way to much, to the point where it becomes rather annoying.All this aside, the film comes across as a nice light hearted romp through our universe with subtle cameos by the likes of Jason Schwartzman and Kelly MacDonald. It's very good for what it is, and despite the shallow love story, it's definitely worth a watch.This has been one of the only reviews by Rob Beeghly.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
523,ShanerMD,Even a towel won't help this one...,1,28 September 2005,"Silly me...way back when this was announced I thought the real killer would be Mos Def as Prefect. Once again, let us point out that both the radio and TV versions of Prefect were white, and there was no inclination that Prefect was other than white because, let's face it, this was a cast of white people and aliens. Enough. Quit deluding yourselves and trying to satisfy political correctness. Even in the most extreme possibilities, a hip hop star would NOT have worked. A nobody. Somebody undiscovered. Unfortunately, this is not the only case of celebrity perversion of this movie. But let's just get that horrible Prefect casting decision out of the way......to move on to the horrible casting decision of Rockwell. Folks, Mark-Wyn Davies CREATED Zaphod Beeblebrox. Look at him, and go from there. I know he's far too old now. Once again, consult the master of cool and get a NOBODY. Rockwell was a vapid ass with about as much cool as an oven and about as hip as an ankle bone. When are you gonna learn not to infect great cult stories with Hollywood hacks? And Martin Freeman? Scuse me? Why didn't you just pick Hugh Grant? Arthur is not just some clueless dip. He's a clueless dip with a glib tongue and the right way to react to things. Freeman is not. These producers apparently never looked at other portrayals of Arthur. Gag.And if that's the Heart of Gold, I'm the Queen of Monaco. With all the computer graphics at their hands, they couldn't create something original, rather than making it simply a parody of an American vehicle? Cheap bastards.Now...there are some non-totally-bile-filled comments to pass on...Zooey...you are such a cutie. You came so close. However, Trillian wasn't arrogant. You failed to stifle that. I know, the character was never that well developed to begin with, but these kinds of things are not meant for poetic license after 30 years. Sorry babe.And the thing that could have saved this movie...Alan Rickman. A great actor, one of the best. Almost perfect choice for Marvin. Alas, it just wasn't him. A good effort though, and my kudos.As for the script, I wiped my backside with more valuable sheets of paper.Thank you Hollywood. As with Doctor Who in 1996, you have successfully dealt a crippling blow to the image of HHGttG fans. Suck it. Suck it dry.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
524,paleo7,"Fair, but not fantastic.",6,29 April 2005,"As a fan of the ""Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"" material, I was excited about learning of a modern film adaptation. Douglas Adams was a brilliant author in the true sense of the word. Much of his writing in the ""HGttG"" series is not only funny in the very amusing tradition of British humor, but also VERY insightful into philosophy. I was first turned on to the first book when a co-worker advised me to read it ""every time I begin to take myself too seriously"". Good advise.The film version however, lacks some of that insight. Some points are kept in and it feels as if they are shoved into the wrong place in a bad attempt to make everything fit. The characters are portrayed very well by most of the actors (Trillian wasn't very convincing, with the rather poor delivery of many of her lines). The CGI and animatronics were done exceptionally well, but the script seemed tampered with. I know that Adams himself wrote the original draft of the script, but you can clearly tell where the Adams humor starts and stops and where the modern American humor (weak) takes over.Overall, the ""Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"" is a fun movie if you've read the books and know the characters, scenarios, etc. If you are unfamiliar with the story and so on, you probably won't enjoy it as much. If you are expecting an extremely faithful adaptation, you will be disappointed. However, it is probably the best adaptation that could have been done with the material. Its a hard series of books to adapt to screen. Very hard. Perhaps it should have stayed on the radio and on the page.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

And most of it simply wasn't funny - in the cinema I was in at least, people hardly laughed at all. To use one example of the film's crap humour - the ""goodbye and thanks for all the fish"" line is quite amusing when it's said, but the long ""thanks for all the fish"" song which follows wears the joke out, and becomes just gratuitous and pointless.

But on hearing that Douglas Adams' wrote the script fully before his untimely death and everyone involved in the production was trying to be as faithful as possible to this, I was confident that seeing this film would be something I didn't regret.And how right I was! The film takes most of the key elements of humour from the story, shows them in all their comedic glory, and sometimes makes them even funnier than they originally were (in particular, the opening song is adapted from the dolphins' last message to the humans! classic!)! And anything new - mostly added in by Adams himself - is highly welcome to add to the laughs - especially the Point of View gun - lol! I can understand some cuts to the story because it happens to all book/prior media medium to film adaptations - but most holes seem to have been patched up where cuts were made (except for Humma Kuvala - but that might just mean there will be a sequel - The Restaurant At The End Of The Universe no less!).It was a shame to not see Vroomfondel and Majikthise, or the monkeys with their script for Hamlet, but such things happen when a new interpretation is given to a story (just think of the Peter Jackson's adaptation of Lord of The Rings - cuts galore from the original story but still great movies) Instead the new vision of Arthur Dent's adventures in space stands out by itself as a comic delight - Martin Freeman is great as Arthur - Mos Def was great as Ford (I thought that might be bad casting - but I was wrong!) - Sam Rockwell was outstanding as Zaphod - Bill Nighy and Alan Rickman were very welcome (although I have to say the TV series was better in their incarnations - but the new look Marvin was very cool - anyone else agree they should have kept Stephen Moore's voice?) and anything else were huge dollops of icing on an already very nice cake indeed (except for Humma Kuvala - unless he's developed in a sequel - or a DVD uncut edition).All in all - I can't wait for the DVD - so I'm gonna see the film again soon! And if anything, those who become intrigued by the story and what happens next should go and read the books, watch the TV series, or listen to the radio series - because not only will you get the whole story in all its wondrous glory - you'll get why towels are so important and why I took mine to the cinema with me!

If you walk in thinking it's exactly like the book, then you will be disappointed.The film has additional elements not in the book, like Vogsphere and Arthur & Trillian's relationship.In terms of special effects, how much of the budget went on the factory floor. Wow, must be at least 25% if not more.I was expecting Mos Def to be a poor Ford, but was impressed and Stephen Fry as the book, great but I think I would of preferred Peter Jones (the original voice of the book in radio & TV).Another thing was Marvin, Alan Rickman is great.

530,projectmogul,genuinely horrified,1,2 May 2005,"Even a day later, my thoughts are so addled by this saddening, hopeless and castrated revision of Adams's work that I genuinely don't know where to begin or end. All I can do is implore people not to see this, not even out of idle car-crash curiosity. Where certain British genre movies get it absolutely right (witness Wright and Pegg's 'Shaun of the Dead'), this - with an almost suicidal zeal - wrong notes with every single exposed frame.Perhaps the film's largest error of judgement is any inclusion at all of 'fan-pleasing' cameos - the appearance of Simon Jones only made me yearn for the *real* Arthur Dent, with all his petty, unending suburban irritation (rather than the frighteningly somnambulistic Martin Freeman). Similarly, the fleeting, unheralded return of the BBC's Marvin only served to underline the television adaptation's far greater sympathy with Adams's vision: a Marvin that actually *looks* depressed is nowhere near as funny as one that doesn't.

I normally boycott film re-makes, but I was persuaded by friends to see it with them because they thought that ""advances in digital special effects"" would do the film justice. Well!!! It was horrendous. Adam's writing does not need ""special effects"", because the genius thing about his writing is the humour in it, plain and simple. This film has stripped that element out, leaving, well...nothing good.

Not for Arthur Dent though, hes just expressionless all the movie . examples: when earth explodes, when he teleports, when he sees monsters he doesn't even scream or shows a glimpse of amazement. He doesn't even express himself the whole movies; yes i know thats his personality but still i found his acting pathetic. i read the book and the casting could had done a much better job picking good actors, instead of going for mos def and martin freeman loll.overall, its a good movie with sort of like monty python humor that i really enjoy. the depressed robot alan rickman was very good and the president of the galaxy with 2 faces got very annoying though thats his job in the book. the script was preety faithful to the book though the ending could had been explained much better so people don't leave the theatre without knowing the ending and the reasons why everything happened. Also, in the book symbolism is very abundant when you look for it , but in the movie barely none of it is explained or shown. 7/10",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
533,seventhnaga,A Wasted Opportunity,4,5 May 2005,"There was so much promise, and so little made of it; that was the feeling i came out of the cinema with. All style and no substance would pretty much sum this film up. It started badly for me - Mos Def is not the most obvious choice for the role of Ford Prefect, the fact that he could not pronounce the name 'Guildford', and i was watching him do this in a Guildford cinema did not endear me to his style. Acting in particular was something done fairly badly in this film. The main characters seemed to fall into two camps, the first being those employing the use of irritating hesitance, in some poor attempt to pander to stereotypes of the polite, deferring Englishman, like Martin Freeman and Bill Nighy,and the second camp which used total blathering as the main technique, like Mos Def and that bloke who played Zaphod Beeblebrox - were they on drugs? Were they acting like they were on drugs? Were they acting? I couldn't tell.The special effects were impressive, but then when aren't they these days? What is most important is the carrying of the great legacy of Douglas Adam's brilliant work. Unfortunately his great mind had so many weird and inventive ideas that it is just impossible to get it into the a feature length film, without either seeming like it has missed out a lot of important things, or that it has tried to cram far too much into the time allowed- I ended up coming away from the film feeling both. If you want to experience 'The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy' as it should be, then your priority is to read the book or listen to the radio series.

My sons (aged 49 and 51) and my 2 granddaughters (aged 15 & 21, who had never read the book) all had a grand, laugh-filled time. The use of bright colors in the visuals were spectacular, and the actors (including Alan Rickman) were perfect. The actor who played the confused and timid Arthur Dent was super-perfect, bathrobe, towel and all. (Forgot his name - sorry!) Starting the film with the Louis Armstrong song ""It's a Wonderful World"" was brilliant! All the other music was just absolutely right on the nose. I intend to rush out and buy the soundtrack ASAP. Any fan of the book should NOT miss this film. I look forward to the next film, The Restaurant at the End of the Universe, which I'm certain will be produced. P.S.

But its all there and incredibly funny ! As with the book its the ideas in this film that shine through and hook you - for example the Bablefish, the idea that we are the 3rd most intelligent beings or just the fact that there is a race who live to produce meaningless forms ! These ideas will appeal to adults and children alike which is quite an achievement as many films are usually only aimed at one group.One minor gripe would be as to the quality of the special effects - although not bad think more doctor who here than Spielberg.Please go and see this film - it will make you happy !

Knowing the book, I was convinced that 'The Hitchhiker's Guide"" is a superb but quite an unfilmable story. Then I checked the trailers, I checked the official site and grew to become not so sure about my conviction. Then the film finally arrived in my country and I started to be more and more confused - this time by all sorts of completely opposite comments on it.But don't listen to them - now when I've seen the film by myself I can tell you that as a matter of fact it is wonderfully done and accomplished. It has a great script - the master's hand clearly visible. It has a great cast - everybody looks and behaves exactly as I imagined reading the book. It has great Vogons, great Marvin with Alan Rickman's remarkable voice, great attention put to details - simply it's a great movie and a great fun to watch.

The Hitchhikers guide to the galaxy was a weird book but having read all four books I must say that I found the movie thoroughly entertaining. So much so that I had free refills on my drink but I didn't want to leave my seat for fear of missing something. The movie was also well paced and flowed very well. The zany antics of Marvin the depressed robot were awesome. And Alan Rickman who did Marvin's voice was a great casting call. The whole movie was well worth the price of a ticket in my humble opinion. Go see this movie so that they produce ""The restaurant at the end of the universe.""

I loved this movie, and I don't see why so many others didn't seem to like it. In the IMDb star counter thing, Every time I look at it the stars lessen. I also thought that it was made at the perfect point in time. If it was made a decade ago, the effects would have been terrible, and any later, the film would only be effects. I thought the effects were all they needed to be, full of beautiful scene sets also. It was really funny, and made in an easy-enough-to-understand- way. I also think the casting was done to perfection. Everyone in the film was probably as mad as they needed to be, both in the film, and in their own head. The only bad things about this movie were A)The seat I was in was not in a good place B) It was not in the biggest screen in the cinema,xXx2 was (I REALLY don't know why, it looks awful C) The fear of not enough money for a sequel! I strongly advise anyone and everyone to go see this movie!!! (and enjoy it!!!)",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
540,battlecrycreek,Good for fans of the book/radio and newbies alike!,8,2 May 2005,"Unfortunately anyone who sees this movie will probably know that there are books that have some sort of highly regarded status. See Roger Ebert's review on how that can definitely color one's view of the film. He doesn't ""get it"" and doesn't wish to either. But after several viewings, I don't think that it's necessary to be familiar with the books to enjoy the movie. There is a lot in the movie, however that may take repeated viewings to completely appreciate though, since the movie does have a rather brisk pace, and the narration, which I think works well, occurs amidst some action (thinking about the scene that explains how the invention of the aerosol can predated the invention of the wheel on a particular planet). It's quite hilarious (love the square wheeled bicycle!), but the main characters are rushing along, and if you are encountering it for the first time you might miss all there is to the narration.This points to the fact that the film direction seems a little fast paced with seems consistent with the story, although if you are used to the book it might seem too fast. For example, the scene in the beginning where Ford convinces the man in charge of the bulldozers to take Arthur's place is done rather quickly with Ford engaging the bulldozer drivers in a way that isn't in the book. One comment suggests that this was a mistake since it would take just as long to film what actually occurs in the book (with maybe a 5 second difference). I don't believe that is the case at all. It would have take 3 times as long to film the scene as it was in the book, so they needed to speed that a long somewhat. It is unfortunate that the pacing of the movie does seem to be at odds with the book, but I think it's just a matter of what one is used to.The one misstep which has been mentioned a few times already is the relationship between Arthur and Trillion. Did the studio insist on this? Kind of felt like that.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
541,ansr2507,If you want to survive this you've got to know where your towel is,9,25 September 2005,"First I loved the books, then the TV series and now this film. If you haven't read the books or seen the series this film might take some time getting used to as it is, well let's say, somewhat bizarre.Arthur Dent (Martin Freeman) has a really bad day. First he is told to vacate his house and then the Vogons ( a very bureaucratic alien live form) destroy the planet earth all together as it has to make way for the new hyperspace express way. Now Arthur is in for a ride, as he's been saved from certain death by his somehow strange friend Ford Prefect (Mos Def). Ford, an alien himself, shows Arthur that there is more than just earth. Oh boy yes, much more. Arthur meets the Vogons (although he'd probably have liked to miss out on that experience), Zaphod Beeblebrox (Sam Rockwell) the two-headed president of the galaxy, manic-depressed robot Marvin (Alan Rickman-voice), Slartibartfast (Bill Nighy) who's already putting together earth II and last but not least he meets Trillian (Zooey Deschanel) a fellow earthling. They all travel the galaxy in order to find the answer to the question of ""life, the universe and everything"". The only way to survive this adventure is with the help of his friend Ford, the ""Hitchhike's Guide to the Galaxy"" (that luckily reminds you not to panic) and of course most importantly a towel.Okay, Garth Jennings hasn't created the ultimate new version of the Hitchhiker's Guide but I think it is exactly that what makes this film so good. The mind-boggling special effects, very colourful sets and lovable CGI creatures make this film somehow special. The good old story just filmed again with more technological possibilities. Just take the scene where Arthur and Slartibartfast inspect earth II. Brilliant! Besides, listening to the dolphins in the beginning just makes you happy. You just HAVE to tap your foot along rhythmically and nod your head from side to side with a huge big grin on your face and sing along.If you're in for a good time: WATCH IT! And hey, don't forget to bring your towel along-you'll need it to dry your tears.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
542,lenkyliciousness,Terrible - If you're a fan of the original STAY AWAY,1,27 May 2005,"I'd just like to start of by saying this film was absolutely terrible. The original plot was manipulated into some grotesque monster of a story, with some of the funniest parts dropped and replaced with an unnecessary love triangle. The only reason this is getting 1 out of 10 is because you can't give zeros.I found the acting atrocious at times, the only good contributions by Martin Freeman and possibly Alan Rickman. Although chronically depressed Alan Rickman would seem perfect for the part of chronically depressed Marvin, it just doesn't seem to fit and is lacking somewhat. However compared to the rest of the cast he seems to shine. Martin Freeman is fairly stereotypical and plays the part well, although he loses all credit in the sappy love scenes.As for the other actors, I found Mos Def drab, boring and unconvincing as Ford Prefect. His delivery is poor and unsatisfying and I'm sure a better actor could have been found. Sam Rockwell as Zaphod Beeblebrox kind of irritated me and as a drunken lunatic he bored me more then amused me. And what was with the second head underneath his own neck? I much preferred the limited animation of the television series head to this strange insane one. Zooey Deschanel gives a luck-lustre performance as Trillian and honestly, I just wanted her to go. Kill her off, have her eaten by (pig-shaped) Vogans, anything would've done. but of course she has to be kept around as the 'love interest'. Bill Nighy is so-so but not to my taste. Out of the worst actors he is probably the best.To conclude I'll just add something to my original summary: If you are a fan of the original stay away and if you have never seen/heard the original, spare yourself the boredom and stay away also.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

This movie, however, is the worst waste of money I've ever been to. The book WAS a screenplay for crying out loud. The cast and movie were too Americanized, Marvin looked like a child's toy, Zaphod is supposed to have two heads, not two faces, and I could go on and on. A love story between Arthur and Trillian? GIVE ME A BREAK! To fix this lousy waste of time, fire the whole cast (keep Alan Rickman as the voice of Marvin), fire all the screen writers and use the bloody book, then turn it all over to Pixar.People go to movies to see their favorite book brought to life.

544,stemd03,The truth about the Htichiker's nap in the galaxy.,2,3 May 2005,"The above person obviously has no clue what makes a good movie, although there was some mediocre dry British humor, this movie is extremely lacking. The main problem being that you keep watching it thinking why don't I like this? Then you realize that you are attempting to talk yourself into liking such a run of the mill movie. I think this was picked up to capitalize on the excitement of Star Wars, but as the above says, it was all crammed into 110 minutes. There is no actual villain in the story, and anything that can be conceived as a villain is not developed well enough. Martin Freeman does an excellent job playing his character and so does Mos Def, but they are doing it in something that cannot be conceived as a story. There is no story arc, and many of the friends I was there with fell asleep during it. Also there were multiple references to always having to carry a towel, which only comes into play once, and is never really explained after that, but the statement, ""do you have your towel"", or something equally ridiculous is repeated, except for some poor attempt at a joke in the end. This movie is for those who want to go around and claim that they are informed about movies, but in actuality just like whatever dung is thrown at the wall because everyone else is jumping on the bandwagon with them. Your money would be better spent going to see something you liked again. If you want a good story about hitchhiking read Kerouac's ""On the Road"", and if you want a sci-fi twist imagine the main character as Han Solo, or Chewbacca. I give this a step above the lowest rating possible, because the effects I will admit were pretty decent, and there was not an over-reliance on CG.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
545,U92,"Excellent effort, but edited by Vogons",7,8 May 2005,"Way too much Hollywood slapstick. Too many of the truly witty jokes or lines from the previous H2G2 incarnations were either omitted or neutered. A lot of stuff you see and hear is never explained. Makes the established fans feel ""in"" on the joke, but I suspect a lot of the depth of the humour goes missing if this is your first exposure.The more reinforced romantic angle is welcome; some of the execution is too predictably Hollywood. Also found the ending a bit Hollywood-style sappy.I fear that to those who aren't already familiar w/ H2G2, it'll be just another amusing movie to see and forget, while established fans will wonder what happened to all the clever lines.Good news is that the actors were excellent, every single one, which also reflects well on the director. The Vogons were utterly perfect and I loved the factory floor of Magrathea.The new characters and scenarios were mostly improvements or at least harmless, but some perfect humour opps were missed. There was one scene in a totally new plot twist where both one of the uses of towels and the Achilles heel of the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal could have been illustrated. In fact, they appeared to be setting it up, and then it just didn't happen. Very deflating.I will probably see it again when it comes to the local rep house, but I don't believe this movie will spawn a lot of popular taglines, especially given that so many of the best ones weren't even in it. I hope that a director's cut comes out on DVD. It looks as though the editing process was somewhat influenced by Hollywood studio Vogons. They didn't destroy the movie (that would be impossible), but it isn't even close to what it could have been and deserved to be. I think everyone else - writers, director, and actors - did their jobs superbly.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

Even Allan Rickman and John Malcovich, who are usually brilliant actors, look like someone is pointing a gun at their head the whole time. And about the plot: Nothing happens during the entire movie. they fly around in a video-game-type linear plot, things just happen and there is no logic at all (I don't mean real-world logic but there's no logic in the movie's universe).

547,anthonyjaeger,Just Cringe-worthy...,2,6 September 2014,"I know that it's cliché to say, ""The books were better!"", but in this particular case, there's almost no comparison to the books at all. It's like EVERYONE involved in this film had never even read the books.It seems like the writers just randomly copied and pasted a few sentences from each page to create a script that feels so rushed and incomplete that it's almost embarrassing to say to someone that ""the books were awesome!"" (to someone who's only seen this film). I literally find myself cringing every time they miss a joke by rushing through it and hoping for the best. Almost all the potential humor dissolves immediately in this film because of the super-fast pace and highly edited script. I've seen this movie a few times and every time I hope to enjoy it (or at least dislike it less) than the last time, and I'm always disappointed. The BBC did a better job 25 years earlier with almost no budget!On the positive side, Martin Freeman and Stephen Fry were decent casting choices. On the negative side, every other casting choice was pretty bad.If they ever make a decent adaptation of the books, I hope that they take it a lot slower and actually appreciate the dry, British humor as opposed to trying to rush through it like a face paced game-show. They also need to cast the characters exactly as described by Douglas Adams in the books and not just make so many random choices.Let's hope that someone comes along and does a better job in the future. If they do, they may have a chance of making ALL the movies in the entire book series!",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
548,Edwardcole,"It made me more depressed than Marvin (Or, Mostly Useless)",1,20 January 2007,"First of all, I absolutely loved the TV series. I then bought all five books in the series, and I listened to the previous radio series. I was aware that with all of the material that the late Mr. Adams had written, editing would be difficult. There had to be parts of the series that were absolutely wonderful that had to be left out of the movie.Unfortunately, it appears as if they left ALL of the good parts of the series from the movie. Who actually came up with the screenplay, the marketing division of the Syrius Cybernetics Corporation? It was if every change from the series was intentionally made to make this excuse for a movie absolutely awful. I wouldn't say that is movie is crap, but that's only because I'm afraid crap might sue me for defamation of character.As for the performances, they ranged from forgettable to I wish I could just forget it-able. I'm not certain whether the fault is with the actors, the writer, or the miscasting director. Simon Jones, who starred as Arthur Dent in both the radio and TV series, has a brief appearance, which puzzles me. He must not have known how bad they would have made this waste of celluloid.I will conclude on a slightly positive note. This film does give insight as to what the ultimate question actually is. Unfortunately, the question is, ""What is the cumulative IQ of all of the writers, producers and directors of this movie?"" Anyone who doesn't understand that or the other references I've made should really either read the books or watch the TV series. All of us fans who heard of Douglas Adams' premature death, ironically caused by trying to make himself healthier, died a little bit themselves when they heard the news.

I like SciFi, but I'm more into realistic ones that trick you into thinking you're part of that world. This movie didn't do that, it did the actual opposite. It just had too much comedy, and not the good kind.
No character development. It made me feel nothing towards the characters. They were just there, part of the scenes, and nothing more.
It had great potential but it decided to be casual and not pursue it.So, in short, it's a cool movie. And I suggest it, even though I didn't like it that much, but it's enjoyable, and I'll keep you focused.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

Loads of scenes were cut as not many people would want to sit down for a 3 hour comedy, but i found it an absolutely great modern adaptation of the originals.The film moves towards more of a dramatic affect and love interest rather than loads of weird segments describing certain things, which was great in the episodes but i suppose the producers didn't want to repeat this.Overall if your an avid fan maybe this isn't for you, but if you want something a bit different, definitely one to watch.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

It wouldn't be HHGTTG if it wasn't. However, the other versions are funny. This one isn't.The narration bits and the best scenes have been cut to the minimum, defeating the reasoning behind keeping them in the film. Arthur and Ford arguing with Mr. Prosser, the arrival on the Heart of Gold, and many necessary explanations behind certain events are missing. This is mainly because the production people got it in their heads that this is about the plot, which it isn't. It's about the characters and the jokes and the commentary. However, they tried to throw in a plot line anyway, eliminating several good jokes to make room and inserting very bad ones. For the most part, everything that made this story worthwhile has been hacked out.There is SOMETHING to be said for this movie. The acting is one thing. Besides Sam Rockwell, who's inherently dislike-able Zaphod was played as more stupid than passive, the cast did a fantastic job. I was glad that they didn't take the easy way out and have all of the space-age stuff done in CGI, the sets and puppetry are much more convincing and look awesome. I was glad that ""Journey of the Sorcerer"" made it into the film.

The book mentioned the importance for a hitchhiker to always have it close by. During the book we were told more and more about why and what it could be used for. In the movie Ford just runs around saying how the towel is important... we never get told why. It's like the director is only telling half the joke because of a limited time frame. The movie in general feels like it has no real plot since a lot of scenes, that in my opinion gives value to the story, has been cut.

Fans of the series can rest easy knowing that Adams' unique vision has remained intact.For the uninitiated, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is the epic journey through space and time of an Earthling named Arthur Dent. Arthur is one of the last survivors of the planet Earth which was demolished to make way for a space bypass. Unbeknownst to him, his best friend Ford Prefect is an alien stuck on Earth researching information for the newest version of the Guide. They hitch a ride off from Earth seconds before its destruction and stumble their way into a much larger quest. A quest headed up by Ford's semi-cousin and current President of the Galaxy Zaphod Beeblebrox, a two headed, three handed half-wit. Also along for the ride are Tricia McMillian, the only other survivor of Earth, and Marvin the Paranoid Android. Their goal being to find a question that matches up to the ultimate answer to Life, The Universe, and Everything! If you're confused, refer to the tagline again and Don't Panic! HITCHHIKER's is a hilarious romp through the mind of Douglas Adams and his creations brought to the screen by producer JAY ROACH and first time director GARTH JENNINGS. Jennings manages to keep the story moving forward in a coherent manner despite the chaotic nature of the novel and the numerous references from the Guide into the main storyline. He also shows great restraint by not utilizing a lot of CGI in the film. In some ways, a throw back to the TV show, as evidenced by the appearance of Marvin from the BBC series.Another one of the film's strong points is the inspired casting job. Each cast member steals the scenes they're in resulting in a twisted game of one-upmanship among the cast. And yet, in doing so, they manage to keep it from going over the top into the absurd.Quite likely, the audience will feel the stand out performance comes from SAM ROCKWELL, who plays Zaphod Beeblebrox, the aforementioned President of the Galaxy. Rockwell's Zaphod is what you would get if George Bush Jr. were to merge with Ozzy Osbourne. MARTIN FREEMAN, plays troubled Arthur Dent with a very down to earth believability that reminds viewers of someone they know. MOS DEF shows great comedic timing with a solid performance as Ford Prefect. ZOOEY DESCHANEL manages to do a great deal with Trillian, eliciting empathy from the audience and creating a strong character from what was previously a minor role. ALAN RICKMAN is perfect as the melodramatic, depressed android Marvin. One can literally, you can feel the weight on poor Marvin's shoulders as he begrudgingly plows through menial tasks all the while complaining. And finally, STEPHEN FRY does an exceptional job of bringing the melodic voice of the Hitchhiker's Guide to life.From the epic set layouts and costuming to Jim Henson's Creature shop's designs, everything about this film is unique and quite memorable. Be warned, however, as the opening musical number will remain stuck in your head for days.All around, this film is destined to become a cult classic among both new and old fans alike.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

560,dan-ireson,Hitchhiker's Guide? More like Highjacking Terrorist!,4,11 June 2008,"I have read a few comments left by users about this title. Some agree with mine but far too many it seems deem this film worthy of the title it boldly advertises as if the film were anything like the books by Douglas Adams.Some users comment that they have read the books and are very happy with the end result of the film as an adaptation of the original story. I don't know how they could have arrived at this conclusion seeing as they clearly have their heads stuck up an extremely hard to reach area of their anatomy.The film sucked plain and simple. It was badly cast from start to finish, except somehow getting Simon Jones (who originally played Arthur Dent in the radio broadcasts and TV series) to play a part as the Magrathean voice (or head). The pace was all over the shop. The design of set and graphics were good-looking but unimaginative. And, lastly, oh god this is one hell of a lastly, the story ...was...awful! It didn't even resemble a coherent proximity to the original story and am surprised to hear that Douglas Adams was an adviser for this film.It looked good but that was it. Honestly, read the books. They are fantastic. Listen to the BBC radio tapes either from amazon or buy off of itunes. These are also outstanding. Watch the original TV series. It's very outdated and sometimes painful in acting but at least sticks to a reasonably similar plot.Then compare.The recent adaptation, (adaptation? more like a literary rape. Huh!), doesn't do any justice to this classic sci-fi works by Mr Adams.And this film is the reason their probably won't be a sequel.

I don't really feel that the movie was true to the spirit of book, nor even the quickly cooling corpse of the book.It seems to me that the movie would have been a bit more true to the spirit of Adams' stories if it were less like the book. Maybe a new story from the Hitchhiker's Universe instead of a movie version of the actual Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy novel?I liked the rendering of the characters. I could have done without the big headed Marvin costume, but otherwise thought the casting was right on, as was the sets and FX. But the story was weak. It started off OK, but then when the movie begins to deviate from the original story it quickly looses, not only Douglas Adams' actual story, but any coherence. I know, I know...its a surrealistic comedy. But Adams, despite having a surreal storyline, managed to maintain coherence in his stories. The movie did not.

With the exception of Trillian and Slartybartfast, the characters are poorly acted. Zaphod, once ""cool"" and self-centered, is now just a jerk. Ford no longer has the tragic angle, but is just weird. The plot has been reworked to go as fast as possible, so that no one who hasn't read the books can have any idea what is going on. In their rush to pack things in, many jokes and themes are skipped, and other jokes delivered so poorly that it is easy to forget to laugh. All this rush, and yet time is wasted on contrived scenes not in the book and the endless and banal dolphin intro. 2/10 for great art in the planet construction scenes and the vogon costumes. These are the exceptions to the overall feel of the artwork, which is cheap and unimaginative. The artwork in the 80's movie is better, if lower budget. The acting there is far better.

If you had once told me The Hitch Hiker's Guide would one day become one of the worst movies ever made I would never have believed you. Some of the worst acting of all time - not even good enough for YouTube! Sad that in the end they didn't use people at all just pieces of wood for the whole cast.Top Miscasts - Mos Def - As much charisma and pizazz as a spending a week being suffocated by a dead jellyfish. (Ford Prefect should have been someone like Jonny Depp) Sam Rockwell - Sam Rockwell is simply not a rock star, as much charisma as .. (plus Stupid 2nd head SFX that totally ignores the laws of physics) Bill Nighy - must have been dialling it in - or he was spending a year dead for tax reasons...Lets not mention the awful artless art design & SFX eg Marvin, Vogon spaceships, babel fish, Deep Thought - its (almost) like they were trying to make the worst movie they could.Top Six Worst SFX No 6 : The computer graphics are / look better in the 80's version!!!!! No 5 : Deep Thought looks deformed!, N0 4 : Marvin is ridiculous, No 3 : and The Heart of Gold does NOT look like a sleek running shoe! No 2 : The Vogon ships are cubes!! so lazy. No 1 : Zaphods head. Could have done better with string, sticky tape, toilet roll tubes, and a bit of paint. On SFX beats even Battlefield Earth!!! Lets not mention the worst bit of all - the script. (and from the amazingly brilliant source material in the books and the 1981 BBC TV series) The one good thing about Douglas Adams being dead first - he never got to see how truly bad and dreadful it all was.Should be in the list of the top 10 worst films ever made.

564,steve-1135,"Life, the universe and everything except jokes",4,3 May 2005,"A previous commentator mentioned that the film added a love story that was ""sadly lacking in the original"". It wasn't sadly lacking: it wasn't there for a purpose. I admire Martin Freeman's body of work, but he was directed badly in this film. The beauty of the Arthur Dent character is that he is an Everyman buffeted by events beyond his control. This causes him to become increasingly petulant and annoyed with the universe, which generated huge amounts of humour. In the film we are invited to sympathise with him because he's lost his home, girlfriend, planet in consequence he becomes a nicely rounded post-90s touchy-feely character, but guess what? He's no longer funny.Clichéd love stories are ten-a-penny. Genuinely intelligent stories that make you cry with laughter are extremely rare. HHGG was one of these, but the director seems more intent on making a something-for-everyone love story with oodles of special FX than making an intelligent comedy. After an extremely engaging opening sequence, my first worry with the film was that most of the jokes from the original scene when the construction workers are trying to knock down's Dent's house have been edited out. Thus, Arthur's wonderfully angry line about discovering the plans for the bypass in a dingy cellar behind a door marked beware of the leopard become a somewhat feeble ""I found them in a cellar"".This happened repeatedly. For instance, when Arthur hits the Improbability Drive button and saves all their lives, the book has Zaphod acknowledging Arthur for the first time, with genuine admiration. ""Oh it was nothing,"" says Arthur. ""OK,"" says Zaphod and walks off. ""Well, when I say it was nothing, it was obviously something,"" says Arthur, but no- one is listening, much to his chagrin. In the film, the same scene, the same drama, but no joke. The humorous exchange, like so many others, is missing.This is not an issue of the book being better than the film, but an issue of how you adapt a book, and this wasn't adapted very well. The pace was ploddy and much of the intellectual whimsy and sharp exchanges that make the original a classic were edited out to make way for overlong special FX and an utterly unneeded love story.Some of the jokes are still there, and they've even added one or two that were OK; all of the actors do a fair job, but hardly give career-best performances. Marvin is still engaging and I liked the bit about the crab. So 4 out of 10 for that.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
565,gloff,"Just could not be done in one movie, but see it anyway.",7,23 July 2006,"First let me state I liked this movie. I was pretty sure going in that there was no way anyone could do justice to a 4 book ""triolgy"" in one movie. The producers should have went with Adams and trusted the fans to be patient and support 4 movies or more.I liked the performances and thought Marvin came the closes to his book counterpart and Sam Rockwell as President Bebelbrox totally missed the mark with his over acting.Zooey Deschanel gives her usual good performance but was definitely short changed by the writers.Sadly Douglas Adams was not here to give his guidance for the film and one wonders if he would have even considered trying to convey his masterpiece in one movie.I've since watched it on HBO and must admit I liked it better the second time.I can probably count on one hand movies that were worthy of the books they came from most notably ""The Lord of The Rings"" and that's because they knew it could never be done in one movie.I hope they try the other books but probably have killed that possibility with this effort.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

However the story and character development in the original series generated so much laughter that my wife and I have watched it at least 3 times . Like many other reviewers we enjoyed the opening and then watched the movie immediately go flat. I was amazed to see Ford Prefect cast as an amiable goof rather than a focused intergalactic guide as in the original. Even the depressed robot Marvin's body language and dialog lacked the punch of the original. And of course the dramatically different ending seemed to be tacked on as an adjustment to a test audience screening. The ending of the original series which takes place in a cabaret type bar at the end of the universe, which was superb, was discarded in favor of an ending that the writers thought would run the least risk of displeasing any audience members. In a way I'm jealous of those moviegoers who never saw the original. I heard a few laughs from that group in the theater. Somebody should of hired a writer who read the original rather than a script surgeon whose main focus was to assure a wholesome, neatly wrapped, unoffensive ending.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

I thoroughly enjoyed them, already being a fan of absurdist British humor such as Monty Python. There were many things from the book that were not in the movie, but this is not a bad thing. Non HH readers who will watch the movie and enjoy it may feel inspired to read the books to get more background on the characters and plot points. There will undoubtedly be a resurgence in interest in the ""trilogy"", and this is a good thing. Even with the omissions, changes, and additions, the movie is true to the book both in spirit as well as the primary plot. The cast and crew all rise to the challenge of doing Douglas Adams justice.

While still funny and making a lot more sense in places than the TV series, the fact that I loved the aforementioned TV series so much meant that I have watched it so many times, the old jokes were a little stale in this movie adaptation. This is in part because the lines weren't delivered as good as the actors in the series (except maybe Arthur who put more energy into his role than the former actor who played the part), although the delivery was still good enough that I can see that anybody who hasn't seen the series would still find them funny, but the main reason was there were less moments when we got to see the funny extracts from the Hitchhikers Guide itself. Everyone of these bits, which include explanations of the Babel fish and Bogon poetry to name but a few, are hilarious, but three quarters of the way through the movie they more or less just stop appearing. The guide is where most of the comedy came in the television series, as none of the characters, except marvin the manically depressed robot (whom is also given far too little to do or say in the movie), are really all that funny, but the movie relies heavily on them. This brings me to the actor who played Ford Prefect (Dos Jef or something like that) whom i found very bland and lacking comic timing in a few places. All in all though, this is a faithful adaptation of a much loved book by a genius writer and I look forward to seeing if the DVD comes with any extra bits (such as more parts from the guide itself) to make it a more complete and even more enjoyable movie.

571,s3045278,HitchHikers Guide to Mediocrity,3,28 April 2005,"I just saw the movie an hour ago. It BLEW.Don't get me wrong - it wasn't TOTAL crap. In fact it was funny at times. ""at times"" the key words. Y'know why I say it Blows? Not cuz it was a total ****fest but rather it had the potential to be great but settles in to be truly mediocre. Thats why it BLOWS.I've read 3 of the books and I enjoyed them but I'm not what you call a ""true fan"". I just enjoyed them for what they were- fun reads. And keep in mind the humour in the book was quirky and British. Not just quirky for the hell of being quirky. Thats what the movie is and thats what makes it unfunny.I Think Americans might lap this up cuz the humour is geared towards what they expect to be ""quirky"". But ppl from outside America (I honestly believe its a cultural thing, no offense) who've read the books will get what I mean. Its like one of the first proper reviews that came out for this film (not that AICN suck up garbage) said - its like most of the jokes are from the book and are in the movie, but with out any punch lines from the books. There's other things like the crappy CRAPPY romance that turns the Movie into A love story movie and its just Executed in a really lousy manner. Plus Zaphods Character is just done stupidly. Yeah, he's zany an all- and you laugh at his antics for about ten minutes - and then his shtick gets old really quick. adding to the woes there's a major cop-out at the end (again something I believe geared towards pleasing American audiences) ***SPOILERS****They reconstruct the fricken earth again with all the ppl just as it was before it got blown up. Utter crap. A ""happy"" ending of sorts thats really just not needed. Why cant Arthur and trillian be the last two humans and go on adventures like the in books? Why cant the whole earth being destroyed and staying that way be a ""bitter sweet irony"" thing and leave it at that without the whole ""play Crowds BS happy forever"" ending? **SPOILERS OVER*** Then there's the plot itself. Ppl who haven't read the book will NOT be able to make any sense of this movie. It zips from one plot point to the other too quickly, never really establishing anything properly (apart from the crappy romance subplot) and in the end doesn't make much sense unless you have some prior knowledge of the book. It depends too much on its characters wackyness and fails as a result. I honestly fear mainstream audiences will not get what the hell is going on. Whats done well? Marvin The robot voiced by Alan rickman - again done decently but still could have been so much better. The guide - the animations inside the guide are great and are ACTUALLY FUNNY. Thats how you do humour with a Quirky edge. The Dolphin song at the start. The vogons were done decently as well - but by the end of the movie were just way overused.Man, this movie just erks me. There's potential there for it to be brilliant - for it to be totally faithful to the spirit of the book. Hell there's MOMENTS of genius. But by the end its all P*SSED away. Its a pale imitation of what made the novels funny.It just tries to Hard to be funny/zany and ends up being substandard for the most part. Its like its got a sign that says ""Look at me - Look how funny I am, I'm quirky, I'm weird I'm cool"" but like most try-hards just ends up being lame. Thats what erks me so bad.

No, it's not the plot to yet another Star Wars movie, but the intro to The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy.The Office's Martin Freeman plays Arthur Dent, our hapless hero of this outrageous intergalactic comedy. Arthur has pretty much lost everything that he holds dear and a trip through an unknown star system is what he needs. Throw in a hilarious performance by Sam Rockwell, as Zaphod Beeblebrox, the galactic president, who has kidnapped himself and stolen the most prestigious ship in the galaxy, and a comically dour Alan Rickman, as the voice of Marvin the robot. Top this with Mos Def, as Ford Prefect, who gives a good performance that could rival that of David Dixon's original, and also the very lovely Zooey Deschanel, as Trillion, Arthur's lost love. Spice it up with cameos from Bill Nighy, some woman who can't take her eyes off Mos Def in the pub and John Malkovich. Finally, blend it all together with the debut direction of Garth Jennings and you have what could be one of the funniest films of the year.The movie stays true to the original radio and TV series, but gives newcomers, like myself, an insight into what the Hitchhiker's Guide is really about.

Special effects aside, I found the 1981 BBC TV Series much more faithful and entertaining. That is not to say it hasn't got good moments, but are far and between. The exploration of the planet factory in Magrathea is my favourite moment. And also the book animations, which disappear halfway through and are sadly missed at the end.

The opening song was funny though and the creatures and space scenes look good but overall it was just a matter of passing the time rather than being excited or laughing my heart out. Perhaps fans of the book or previous screen adaptations will like it and are rating it highly but for me it was very disappointing.

582,Luigi147,"Good, but not THE Hitchhiker's Guide",6,12 May 2005,"To start with, I must say that this film IS a above par film... but for me, it just didn't fit with the franchise.Having read, listened and watched (TV), as i'm sure many others have, I have formed my own opinion of what the film should look like; which is obviously impossible to convey on the film. But just was too far off.For example, the Vogons. WOW! I have to confess that they were impressive to say the least - but that was the problem. VOGONS ARN'T IMPRESSIVE! and what is with the Vogon gimps?. For me, the TV series' cheap finger puppet renditions made it all work - I don't know how other people felt, but when the Vogon captain says ""the plans have been on display for the past 10 light years"" (or something along those lines), it just didn't sound...funny. These things happened throughout the film and one of the biggest disappointments for me was the lack of the personality doors (and Marvin's arguments).In terms of cast, i'l agree with most other reviews in saying that Martin Freeman fitted into Arthur's shoes very neatly (though he did seem a little weak in places). Mos Deff on the other hand; i'm sorry but what the hell is a guy from Guilford doing with an American accent? Itjust didn't work. Also, Sam Rockwell (i am a fan of his) just played Zaphod as if he was smoking something extreme. Zaphod is and always has been cool; he was one of those guys who could steal your girl at a party, brag his was out of washing up leaving you to do it cause he's such a cool guy. Sorry Sam, it just didn't work. Sadly, Trillian (played by Zooey Deschanel and as mentioned in other reviews) was by far the most disastrous character in the film - she was wooden. Enough said. Don't worry, i have good things to say. Marvin (Alan Rickman) was fantastic! Though his design is debatable (was Marvin ever cute?) there is no better voice for the part and if anything i would have liked to have seen more of him. John Malkovic was good, though i'm not sure if he fitted into the story that well. As always Bill Nighy made the part his own without fault. As did Stephen Fry.the mixing up of the classic story didn't do it for me (i am aware that DA did write it though), the Vogons at the end as well just seemed strange and the end itself is completely removed from the book - roughly. Yes, i'm feeling bad for being critical, but trying to share my opinion. Hope this has been useful.One last nag...no where near enough of The Guide itself and the Deep Thought on Magerathea thing just was weird (as was Deep Thoughts voice)See the film but don't think it's gonna be like the books, radio or TV.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
583,hooloovoo-1,Wonderful movie for long-time fans or first-timers,10,3 May 2005,"I have been waiting for this movie to come out for the better part of three years. I first heard about the movie in late 2002, when I first read ""The Salmon of Doubt,"" a sort of last goodbye to Douglas Adams. I was almost scared to see it because I was afraid it wouldn't do him justice or it would fall short of my high expectations. As it turns out, I had absolutely no need to fear--this movie is easily the best I've seen all year, and very likely the best I'll see for quite a while. The visual effects were amazing, but I loved that the entire thing wasn't CGI. They used muppets. MUPPETS. Not even Star Wars uses muppets anymore; Yoda is a CGI character. But the Vogons were truly a work of art, however hideous they were. The characters surpassed all expectations; the casting was flawless. The additions and changes to the plot line were amusing and, I felt, actually made the story flow a lot better than say, the miniseries, ever did. And I'm not the only one who liked it. A few of my friends, who had never heard of Douglas Adams except for my constant ramblings, actually enjoyed the movie, despite their grumblings when I dragged them to it. So overall, this movie is wonderful, and I don't know what else I can say about it. I think that this, more than anything else, was a fitting way to say ""So Long, and thanks for all the fish"" to the creator of Hitchhiker's. Even though he died in 2001, his death is still being mourned, and the completion of this movie would do DNA proud.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
584,Hitsuzen,This movie is Mostly Harmless...,9,25 April 2005,"It's a known fact that the movie adaptation of Hitchhiker's has been up in the air for some years now. Passing from the hands of one director to the next (James Cameron, Spike Jonze and Jay Roach), it wasn't until the idea landed in front of Garth Jennings and Nick Goldsmith that things truly started to take shape.Douglas Adams died from a heart attack in 2001, but after reading the books, watching the film and drawing a comparison, it's clear that Adams would've accepted this adaptation of the TV series of the computer game of the radio series wholeheartedly.Martin Freeman is an inspired choice as the face of Arthur Dent. He's an everyman, his slightly vacant, permanently confused facial expression (which we've all come to recognise from his role in The Office), truly becoming from a man who's trying to make sense of what's Out There, which happens to be similar to, though on a slightly larger scale than what's Down Here. And stupider.Admittedly, it would've been nice to see more English talent taking on the roles from Adams' well loved creation. Steven Fry is THE Guide, the quintessential voice of logic and good-humoured reasoning in the Universe. Bill Nighy makes a great Slartibartfast, coming across as the kindly, if a little absent minded, genius that I've always imagined. And Alan Rickman providing his nasal drones to Marvin the Paranoid Android worked to near perfection.That's not to say that the American cast isn't great. Mos Def and Zooey Deschanel are excellent as Ford Prefect and Trillian, but it's obvious that it's Sam Rockwell who's having all the fun, relishing his role as the over-excitable, reminiscently hippie-rockstar Ex-President of the Galaxy, Zaphod Beeblebrox.So all in all, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is a great experience. Non-Adamites will love it, as will the die hard fans. It's such a shame that its creator had to bow out before his beloved creation came to life, but due to his input into the movie script (the character Humma Kavula, played by John Malkovich, was written by him especially for the movie), his enthusiasm still lives on.Want to go to the Restaurant at the End of the Universe now, please.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
585,elvismonkey,Wonderfully harmful,8,29 April 2005,"How does one turn a brilliantly written book into a movie without losing the great writing of the original? Simple: just copy the book directly into the screenplay.I saw this film on opening night, and the guy next to me was mouthing half of the dialogue. I hadn't read the book in 20 years, but still recognized half the material. Is this a good thing or a bad thing? Argument for good: Adams was wickedly clever, so the writing is fantastic. Argument for bad: Adams was wickedly dense, and much of the pleasure in his books came not from reading the sentences, but from re-reading them, so when adapted for film, the excellent writing just cruises by too fast.More bad: Mos Def and Sam Rockwell stumble through their parts like they'd never read Adams as teenagers. Also, after an exciting beginning, the film starts to slow down a bit and never really picks back up.So why am i giving it an 8? Three reasons: 1. Even though it sails by very quickly, Adam's writing is simply brilliant. There really is no writing in film like this. I imagine i will enjoy it more each time i see it.2. Martin Freeman is the perfect Arthur Dent. I really can't imagine anyone else who could have captured Dent's simultaneous depression and awe. Freeman is going places.3. The opening musical montage is, by far, the most enjoyable five minutes i have ever spent in a movie theatre. I had never seen an audience applaud the opening credits before.It's too bad Adams didn't live to see this, particularly the dolphin scene. So long, Doug, and thanks for all the mental fish.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
586,kbabe416,Proof that a great novelist does not a great screenwriter make,6,17 May 2005,"As a fan of the books, I was really looking forward to the movie and on the whole found it pretty enjoyable. However, the film version has been stuck in development hell for several years and shows it. The story concerns the trials and tribulations of Arther Dent, an entirely average young man who one day learns that his friend Ford Prefect is in fact an alien from the vicinity of Betelgeuse who writes for the ""Hitchhiker Guide to the Galaxy"" and happened to be doing research about Earth...which is incidentally going to be destroyed in about 12 minutes. Arther never could get the hand of Thursdays. The pair make it off the planet in time and are eventually picked up by some improbably familiar faces: Zaphod Beeblebrox an old friend of Ford's and President of the galaxy and Trillian a girl Arther almost made it with at a party. Along with Marvin the Paranoid Android, the four go off careening through the galaxy in a ridiculously perky stolen ship looking for a planet that isn't supposed to exist but may hold the answer to life, the universe and everything. The story of this wacky search for the meaning of life has plenty of meat to carry the movie on its own. It includes not only a lovely answer to life, the universe, and everything; but also a completely hilarious explanation of the true origins of Earth. The filmmakers and, most disappointingly of all, Doug Adams himself however, include lots of random bits that completely detract from this intriguing story. A brief interlude with a religious leader is only mildly entertaining and has absolutely nothing to do with the plot (it was written in specially for the film by Doug Adams and could be just as easily written out again) while a rescue mission, though amusing for its satire of bureaucracy, is far too simple and has no dramatic tension. Another disappointment was the ""Guide"" itself. Though I liked both the animation and voice of the book, I thought it was overused. The excerpt from the ""Guide"" are hilarious in the novel, but simply don't translate to film well.The acting however was quite good and (with the slight exception of Zooey Deneshal as Trillian who came off as rather flat) I enjoyed it immensely; Martin Freeman is letter perfect as Arther while Sam Rockwell is beautifully manic as the Galactic President on the run. Though I initially thought (before seeing the movie) that Mos Def was an odd choice for Ford, I found him quite enjoyable and wished he had more screen time to develop the character more. There are also some great bits of character acting from Bill Nighy and Alan Rickman as the voice of Marvin.The special effects and art direction as a whole are superb: The colorful, retro/modern style fits well with the tone of the film. I especially liked the fact that the Vogon aliens were created with puppets instead of the more ""impressive"" CGI. I have never been a fan of that slick look that CGI characters have next to a real actor and the globby, rubberiness of the puppets was perfect for the Vogons.Though visually beautiful and chuckle-worthy, the skilled actors cannot make up for the fact that, even as they travel billions of light years, the plot goes no where. Still, if one is in the mood for some light summer entertainment, its definitely worth a look.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

Zaphod is great! Just his face made me crack up! Trillian a bit annoying, but not unbearable. No one mentions Alan Rickman as the voice of Marvin- which I find very unfair as he's so funny, and his voice is perfect! And the Vogons are amazing!

588,stormtrooper_in_stilettos,Excellent and fitting tribute to Douglas Adams,10,24 April 2005,"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy movie is good. Really good. You just won't believe how vastly, staggeringly, jaw-droppingly good it is. I mean, you might think that Lord of the rings was an excellent way to reinvent a much-loved franchise by people who well-intentioned, completely understood what made the original popular - but that's just peanuts to the Hitchhiker's movie. Listen.and so on....I just saw this film this morning at a special preview in Manchester and I have to say that it was definitely worth waiting for. It is by no means the best film ever made but it was the best way to convert the book to the big screen. OK it has its problems, there are bits missing from the book and events have been re-written slightly but there one thing you must remember when it comes to the work of Douglas Adams.Each version of hitchhikers (radio, book & TV) is different And so is this one. Also you must remember that this version of Hitchhikers was written by Douglas Adams before he died and therefor any fan who slags it off is simply slagging their favourite book and author. Yes there are some things I would have done differently. I would have put in more of the actual dialogue from the book, more witty remarks, made Zaphod look different, and put more dialogue from 'the guide' back in. But some of these we may get in the DVD release.But you must remember that movies must make money and not everyone gets Adam's work or finds it funny, my ex girlfriend for example. Great sense of humour, very intelligent but she just didn't think that Hitchhikers was funny, amusing but not funny. SO this film has settled for some more mainstream jokes in order to appeal to all viewers. However there is of course material that only fans will get, and thats what makes it good. (watch out for the Heart of Gold leaping at the end of the film, and the vogon fishing game to see what I mean).All in all I liked this film, it was a good attempt and in my opinion the only way they could have made it to suit the majority. Go see it and keep an open mind and you will love it",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

Horrible acting + borderline retarded story + childish humor = Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. The characters were ridiculous and the story was random. The humor in this movie was a step below slapstick. It was boring, repetitive slapstick. It was not funny and targeted the 3-6 year old age group. I did not even find this movie even slightly humorous. I would rather be eaten alive by a horde of bloodthirsty squirrels than see Hitchhiker's again. I never read the book - I don't know if that would have helped, but my advice is to save your money for something that actually has an entertainment value.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

I really didn't know what to expect - I'm a long time Hitchhiker fan who had managed to miss the trailer & hadn't taken any time to ponder how this film would turn out...Fan or not - Hitchhiker's Guide will be wondrously refreshing to all, simply due to the fact that the style is unlike anything that EVER comes out of Hollywood. I couldn't imagine the constant overload of sharp wit and originality fused with the magical & light-hearted tone could displease anyone! Martin Freeman would never have been an obvious choice to me, but was definitely a great one & slipped snugly into Arthur Dent's slippers. The rest of the cast, especially Narrator Stephen Fry, were equally superb in their roles.I can't fault the film at all.

591,jamiepotter17,Very irritating (yet nonetheless amusing at times) film,4,30 April 2005,"First off, this film strikes you as very witty and imaginative. This impression lasts throughout the film: the gags generally work right the way through.However, the 'wackiness' thing just gets really irritating. At first, it's endearing, and then it just gets annoying. Oh, the improbability of it all... Yet, somehow, the predictability of the wackiness just grates like hell, like a bunch of geeks who stand around and repeat Monty Python lines until they've ruined it for everyone else.Martin Freeman is not a movie actor. He will always be 'that bloke from the Office', and he has the facial mobility of a poker player. I wasn't even remotely convinced by the love interest.I don't know how much of this film's failings are down to the book or the director, but they simply do not explain what is going on. Why are they trying to get to this planet (whose name, like much of this film, escapes me)? The film tries to be too clever, and basically doesn't have a plot. It ambles, and you get bored of the incessant 'crazy' jokes. It the kind of film that only Colin the 'mad' office joker from the Fast Show would think was good.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
592,verbiageon,"Pretty awful, really",3,30 April 2005,"The movie has its moments - mostly visual sequences some of which range from impressive to stunning. The jokes are there alright, and I, along with the audience, had a few good laughs. The story mostly falls apart - it's more of a series of vignettes than a narrative. Which is not really a problem - the Hitchhiker's Guide in any format has other things than plot to recommend itself.The worst thing that put me off was the romantic story line involving Arthur Dent and Trillian, and to some extent, Zaphod Beeblebrox. There was a complete lack of chemistry between Arthur and Trillian, and development of this plot line was to me totally implausible. Most sequences with Trillian in them made me roll my eyes and want to leave (has only happened once in the past three years, while watching Elektra). It would have been a much better movie - if not more coherent, at least more true to itself, and generally holding together more soundly, if only the love story element was more subdued. But no, the filmmakers had to bring in the ""human interest"" and harp on it at every opportunity. I think the intention here was to broaden the appeal of the film beyond the Hitchhiker fan base, but - at least to me - it also made the whole thing vapid, rather tedious, and plain embarrassing to watch.Another reviewer (possibly on this site) has mentioned that the Disney Plot Police had a hand in making the film more consistent with their idea of family entertainment. I think the hands and minds behind making and implementing this decision have the ""reverse Midas touch"" - turning everything they touch (including gold) into hogwash. I didn't believe that the ""Disney approach"" could ruin the Hitchhiker for me. I was wrong.By the way, the audience still gave a round of applause at the end - so it could be just me.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
593,ChiefOren,If you read the book - Don't See The Movie!!!!!,2,27 May 2005,"Sometimes I write down a wish list to the movies I would like to see. Number one on the list was Dune by Frank Herbert. Second on the list would be Foundation by Issac Azimov. Third on the list was ""The Guide"" by Douglas Adams. As for Dune, the first movie that came out was a real letdown. The acting as very down, the storyline very loose as to the book, and otherwise a letdown for those that read the book. Fortunately, after a few years, some bright beanie came out with a miniseries that, in my opinion, did honor to the author. Well done rendition that actually had a resemblance to the book. My second choice, the Foundation, was not done, even though a rather cheeky rendition of I Robot did come out. To bad. However, to the nitty gritty. This movie, in the tradition of Dune, is actually worse than the original Dune. It was very soon into the movie that it was sadly so far from the book, that even I, an avid Sci-Fi fan just said sod-it. Bad affects, bad acting, no way did it come near to capturing the true tone of the book. Friends, Dune at least went from bad to better. Even though the TV series was rather shoddy, at least it sticked to the storyline that was meant by Adams. Instead of bad to better, this is a true example of bad to very bad to even more depressing than Marvin.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
594,liam_j_hogan,Apathetic bloody planet,5,21 April 2005,"Last night I was at the world premiere of the new HitchHikers Guide to the Galaxy film, in Leicester Square, courtesy of the BBC's H2G2 competition. Front seat rows, bang in the centre. Nice, though a recipe for neck ache that even the free towel on the back of the seat couldn't prevent I don't have the privilege of coming to HHGG with a fresh view, and it's always going to be difficult to compete against three hugely successful previous formats of the same work. But if I did, then I suspect I might have left the theatre wondering what all the fuss was about. As it was, I can see that the film was its own beast, though I was left flat by the parts that most closely mimic the TV series, partly because the jokes are now 25 years old, and well known to me, but mainly because they didn't do them as well as other versions.And for a series that always excelled in all three formats on carefully honed dialogue, there was a throwaway element that leaves me scratching my head wondering how it got into this state. Example : When Arthur is lying in front of the bulldozer about to demolish his house, and the foreman is telling him that the plans have been on display for weeks, Arthur's reply is that they were in the basement. Now, HHGG fans know that this is the start of a comic battle of wits which is essential to getting the most out of the Vogon's ""Apathetic bloody planet"" comment later. But here, the rest of the dialogue is skipped. Now I know that the movie is shorter than the series, and so cuts of some parts were inevitable, but as it is, the cut isn't deep enough. What is left serves only as a placeholder for your memory of this episode, and for people new to HHGG it is an irrelevance that could have been skipped all together. Either the placeholder is deliberate, or, perhaps, the whole scene was recorded and the sense of it ended up on the cutting floor. I was left with a similar feeling during the Deep Thought recording.Before any other criticisms though, the good bits. 25 years is a long time in CGI terms, and the vogon construction fleet is a marvel. As the camera pans up the simply stupendously huge ship, and you realise it is one of thousands surrounding the earth, you can't fault the directors visual ambition. And that visual style compliments the humour inherent in the story, from the shape of the heart of gold, to the vogon's microphone. I.e. not simply a rendering of the words in the script. Those bits of the movie which are brand new have the power to excite; the point of view gun being the one which is most likely to pass into legend. Martin Freeman is a convincing Arthur, though not one ever likely to say ""I seem to having a tremendous problem with my lifestyle"" - which is presumably why he doesn't. Sam Rockwell as Zaphod is hugely entertaining, though as he plays half the movie with only half his brain, you do get a little tired of his antics. John Malkovich as Zaphod's former political opponent is a great cameo, it's just a shame it doesn't seem to fit in very well in this film.As for the rest of the cast, Mos Def as Ford Prefect never really comes to life, and Zooey Deschanel while enchanting never comes across as a astrophysicist. Perhaps because she never gets the chance to say she is an astrophysicist, because if Sandra Dickinson could convince in that role, then surely anyone could? While reviewers have given Alan Rickman's Marvin a thumbs up, I find him more sarcastic than depressed, a worry I had before the film began. Even the vogons - wonderfully brought to life by Jim Henson's Creature shop, seem to lack bite. Had the office clerk had more of the, say, Roz from Monsters Inc about her, it would have worked much better.As for the book, which is wonderfully voiced by Stephen Fry, who shows an obvious delight at working on this film, the graphics themselves are a mixed bag and don't seem to have much in the way of consistency. While the ""messing around in hyperspace"" graphic is brilliant, the rendering of the ""finite probability machine"" party is in a completely different style from anything else, it seems.Perhaps the biggest gripe of all though is that the Golgrafringham B ark is completely missing. I've always considered this essential to the book, and to Douglas Adam's vision - the earth as a huge computer with an equally huge flaw In this film then the Earth is what it is supposed to be, and it is the universe that is chaotic and arbitrary. Adam Douglas's genius was to mimic what he saw on earth on a grand galactic scale, and this film glosses over his inspiration.Is it as good as it could be? Definitely no. The directors have been brave enough to take it on, and they should be given credit for that, but you do wonder if it would have been sharper if Douglas had been around to see it through. Overall, I'll give it 5 out of 10. 6 maybe if someone goes on to invent that bread cutting knife",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
595,jonathan-bergmann,Could've been better,6,6 May 2009,"I've read the books that genius Adams wrote, and laughed my ass off. When I watched the film, I also laughed, but my ass was still in its place.The start of the movie is good, the dolphins are a good beginning to a movie filled with craziness. The scenes on earth are good, with Freeman in his towels and Mos Def in his awkward alien way.However, once they actually set off for space, the movie just kicks down a notch. Most of the characters that are introduced, are just a tad off. Zaphod is just annoying, Hamma Kavula is not very interesting. And the Vogons, whilst they look good, they're not that funny.Some of the jokes are very predictable and therefore not very funny. The whole storyline of the Vogons trying to capture the president has constantly the same joke about the Vogons being so terribly dull. It just gets tiresome after a while.However, not all is lost. Stephen Fry as the narrator is a very good one, and Marvin is as depressing as you could possibly want.It's a funny movie, but with a little less detours (Hamma Kavula, Vogonsphere), and some better jokes, this could be a classic.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
596,prw_houghton,More disappointing than I'd expected,6,29 April 2005,"I'd seen the trailers and entered the theatre with a mixture of trepidation and hope. The radio show, the books, the TV show, all of them had been immaculately produced (albeit the TV show was limited by technological and budget constraints) and so the pressure was on the film makers to carry on that fine tradition.For me, there were several problems with the production. First, it felt hurried. You could argue that to reach its target audience, a film such as this can't go on for 3 or 4 hours, but they really did gloss over a lot and lost a great deal of structure and timing, e.g. the episode of Arthur's protest against his house demolition makes little comic sense and the ceremony to receive the answer of the big question of life, the universe and everything from Deep Thought is hopelessly timed. The excellent Stephen Fry, voicing the book, sounds like he had an assistant director stood over him with a stopwatch. Second, it seemed to be striving a little too consciously to distance itself from the TV series, resulting in several babies being washed away with the bath water. The H2G2 entries for instance were better rendered in the TV show. Third, several of the performances seemed below par though again perhaps that's with reference to the TV series, e.g. Martin Freeman can't hold a candle to Simon Jones as Arthur. Finally, a lot of the best material has been excised to fit the time scale, including two of my favourites: the Babel fish entry and the Vogon ships hanging in the air in 'much the same way that bricks don't'. And the plot has no real resolution in this production.It's not all bad though. Alan Rickman/Warwick Davis' robot is top notch. I had no problem with them freshening it up with a few extra subplots and bringing it a little up to date (Arthur would never have had a mobile phone in the 70s/80s). And many of the jokes they've added work well in that Hollywood sledgehammer kind of way. Then there's Zooey Deschanel who had me gawping wide-eyed at the screen in much the same way that bats don't. But it could have been much better. Especially if I'd done it!",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
597,kpod,Mild disappointment for die-hard fans (Mild spoilers),7,30 April 2005,"It's not so much a matter of what was left out of the movie adaptation of Douglas Adams's ""The Hitchhicker's Guide to the Galaxy"", as it is what was thrown in by way of extras to make it a self-contained movie, that will probably be most off-putting to die-hard fans of the classic five-book trilogy.The expansion of the role of the Vogons from bureaucratic construction crew to all-around galactic enforcers whose presence permeates the entire film (as opposed to leaving the story about a third of the way in, as per the book) rings a little false. Somewhat less annoying is the expansion of a throwaway joke about religion in the book, into an entire scene.But far more jarring is the end of the movie, which, for the sake of producing the standard ""happy ending"", has one event most definitely not in the first book, which totally undercuts the fourth book, should the movie version of the series ever get that far. It also throws an extra character into the primary mix who will be out of place if the obvious sequel makes it to film.As for the more familiar portions, the opening bits on Earth come off as kind of dull, and a few of the classic segments (such as the one involving the whale) gets a bit tedious when taken verbatim from the book, but in general the pacing is reasonably good and bulk of the story is faithful to the books, which is a lot more than a lot of movie adaptations of novels can say.Overall, not the ground-breaker the books were, but a good, if potentially confusing introduction to anyone not yet familiar with the series.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
598,snorkmaiden,Missed the point,5,8 May 2005,"The book and series were both droll and rambling, cleverly commenting on the bizarre and often whimsical nature of existence, not to mention the need for a good cup of tea. However, I think the movie has missed the point. Nothing much is supposed to happen, it's supposed to be about a kind of existentialist angst!!! Instead, they seem to have lost all the funny commentary and the asides and thrown in more plot, more action, and a love story! Wrong, wrong, wrong.The book was funny because Arthur is the loser who never gets the girl. Sort of a British grown up version of Charlie Brown. Everyone else was supposed to be callous and unconcerned at the destruction of earth, because it's just this planet, right!I was sorry that some of the funniest bits of the original were left out because they obviously didn't develop plot. For example the discussions between the foreman who is going to bulldoze Arthur's house and Arthur. Or the lines are sort of lost or underplayed, such as when the landlord, says 'last orders, everyone' which is a really funny line, but you can hardly hear it.Kind of fun, though. Loved Zaphod and Ford. Slartifartbast was brilliantly portrayed. Marvin was better in the original. Nice little moment with the original Marvin in the queue and Arthur giving him a double take.The best scene is when Arthur and Dent watch the planets being made. Amazing effects. Yeah, I was a bit disappointed. I know that it is a hard call, to please all the fans and that some things always end up being changed. But I think, sadly it missed the overall Douglas Adams tone which is what makes the books (and the series) so great.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

Douglas spent the last 10 years of his life in Los Angeles trying to get the film produced and after his death, his friends and associates continued his work. It's based on a script written by him and Karey Kirkpatrick and, of course, dedicated to him.It starts off in the same way as the novel and radio show, with hapless Englishman Arthur Dent trying to dissuade some council workers from bulldozing his house to make way for a bypass. Soon his best friend Ford Prefect turns up and not only informs him that he's actually an alien from a distant planet, but also that the entire Earth is about to be destroyed by Vogons to make way for a hyperspace express route. Fortunately, Arthur and Ford are able to hitch a ride on the Vogon 'constructor' ship. They meet up with Galactic President Zaphod Beeblebrox and his girlfriend Trillian and from then on, things become wilder and wackier.Each time Douglas Adams produced a new version of Hitchhiker's he changed the plot somewhat, and the film is no exception. It contains a lot of material from the book/radio series (compressed for practical reasons) and also has some new plot lines and ideas. The plot is actually more coherent and self-contained than in the original, and it even has a happy ending. The romantic interest between Arthur and Trillian is played up and forms part of it.The special effects are quite good  much better than in the TV series. Zaphod Beeblebrox still has two heads and three arms. They appear and disappear, but look quite real when they're there. The Vogons are convincing in a disgusting, grey/green, lumpy, smelly way. Not that you can smell them on film, of course, but I'm sure you could in real life. The space scenes and scenes on other planets are great  particularly the one where Arthur's taken on a tour of the planet building facilities on Magrathea.Zaphod Beeblebrox is played by Sam Rockwell and is suitably scruffy, laid back and egotistical. Martin Freeman plays the bewildered, bumbling Arthur, spending the whole movie in his pyjamas and dressing gown. He has his moments of decisiveness and bravery, unlike in the book/radio series, where he spends most of his time searching for a good cup of tea. Zooey Deschanel plays Trillian, but is less intelligent than in the original, as she's just a woman who likes travelling rather than an astrophysicist. Mos Def plays Ford, but I'm not sure why he was chosen as he doesn't fit the description of Ford in the original. Likewise, I was disappointed with the robot Marvin the Paranoid Andriod, as he's short, round and featureless. I'd always imagined him as tall, lanky and more detailed. He's kind of cute in the film, but he wasn't really intended to be. Warwick Davis wears the costume and Alan Rickman provides his voice. Stephen Fry provides the voice of Ford's electronic Hitchhiker's Guide.The film starts and ends with scenes of singing, performing dolphins, and has lots of humour inbetween. As in the novel, part of the plot revolves around the search for the Question to the Answer to Life, the Universe, and Everything. Towels also play an important, although in this case unexplained, function. The film is very funny and upbeat and well worth seeing.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
600,bacchus144,Back...back...back...to the future,8,19 May 2005,"It was hard trying to wait for this movie because the Douglas Adams classic series had such a profound impact on me when i was dorky teenager. Thinking so highly of the 1st book, I was deeply concerned that this movie might be a debacle a la the 1st animated Lord of the rings are Dune (shudder!). And yet, in a lot of ways, the movie works well.Martin Freeman starts rather unconvincingly as Arthur Dent, and he's not helped with the AWOL status of the signature lines in the 1981 miniseries (after finding out the planet is destroyed, he stops and says in typical crushing British understatement: I think I'm upset about that.). Zooey Deschanel is an uneven as she clearly isn't sure how to play the sexy/vulnerable Trillian. On the other, Mos Def's Ford is great and particularly Sam Rockwell's shades-of-George-W Zaphod Beeblebrox and the always great Alan Rickman's manic depressive Marvin the robot are worth the price of admission alone.The best thing about this movie is the judicious use of CGI and the outstanding choice to go to Jim Henson and make the Vogons 3-D and tactile. It was wonderfully quaint and shows how the unchecked use of CGI deceives the eye, not enhances it. It made the final scenes with the wistful Bill Nighy as the Slartibartfast all the more spectacular and wistful, tying Arthur Dent's development. This movie is quaint and done at a slower pace...preserving that style for movies like this is reason enough to check this oddly sweet movie out.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
601,RLent-2,"Mostly funny, but disappointing.",6,5 May 2005,"I laughed during this movie, but not as often as I had hoped. I don't feel it was very faithful to the radio series, the book or the TV series. Ford doesn't seem to have a lot of personality, in my opinion. The special effects were great. I did like the way they presented the Infinite Improbability Drive. I didn't expect it to simply be the TV Series done on the big screen, I simply wish that it had been done as well as the TV Series was. I don't think the new material added worked well, and too often some scenes felt as if they weren't given enough time. If they make The Restaurant at the End of the Universe, I will go see it. I just hope it is better.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
602,jpeagle2005,"Tepid at times, but overall a winner.",8,8 May 2005,"While certainly no American comedy classic like ""Dumb and Dumber"", this quirky flick does a fantastic job at alchemizing a very goofy book into an as goofy movie.Performance-wise, the cast all exceeded my expectations, which was not incredibly difficult, as Mos Def was the only name I recognized among those credited with on-screen faces.The true stand-out, which is admittedly very easy to point at, is the manic-depressive robot, voiced by Alan Rickman. Gloomy and doomy to the very end, his bits of dour discourse interspersed throughout hilariously accentuate this film.The movie drags and repeats jokes, mostly in about the middle, a strangely universal place for that sort of problem, but once you pass the sperm whale, you're home free.Visually captivating, with very good integration of both Jim Henson's creature design and computer generated images, George Lucas should take several pages of notes from this film.Even with a disclaimer, it is still an injustice to give away too much of this movie's laughs and plot devices in a review, so I will conclude with this: Well filmed, creative, and well acted, this strange-but-lovable comedy comes out ahead of the pack in many respects.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
603,frodog23,what the hell is wrong with the English?,3,14 October 2005,"This film is complete garbage. Ever watch a film and get to a point where a lot of the elements of the story have been revealed and you anxiously await the explanation and development of the film? I'm still waiting Garth Jennings you bag of douche. What a dumb and silly movie. And thats coming from a fan of Ace Ventura and Bill and Ted. This movie was like watching Pulp Fiction after somebody cuts out half the movie. Nothing fits. No wonder this thing tanked. And don't give me this crap about ""you wont get it if you don't know the story and/or never read the book."" If this film was made for only those people, then they were conceding a loss of vast sums of money, which we know isn't true.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
604,j-picard,oh dear what a waste!,3,23 September 2005,"Having read the books, listen the radio show, watched the TV series, I thought this was a rather large waste of time, much of it was far too rushed, many of the jokes missed or edited to fast! Spoilers AHEAD:Much of the story changed that seemed to be a Hollywood style (the earth being backed up!) what a lot of crap! What happened to the gulgafrenches, restaurant at the end of the universe, and even the graphics of the book whether better in the original and the original wasn't even done with a real computer. If you MTV generation who cant sit still for more than two hours this will be for you, if however you are of a more desiring taste, and can handle sitting still for 3 or more hours get the TV series !",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
605,martin-785,Slightly disappointing,5,25 June 2005,"Eagerly awaiting this film of the classic books I was a bit let down by how rushed it seemed. Many of the verbal exchanges between characters were shortened to the point where they became almost irrelevant to the film and it was these that gave the story its substance. Witness the conversation between Dent (in front of the bulldozer) and Prosser (wishing he wasn't), reduced to a few quick sentences when the book and the BBC series had much more depth. The book's part in the story was also dramatically reduced compared to the other two.Having said that, the part of Trillian was very much the 'space cadet' she was meant to be and Dent came across like a bewildered ape-descendant. The little bit after Dent saved the day in orbit around Magrathea was quality.I think the film was capable of being truly excellent but, as I said before, the feeling of its being rushed let it down, hence the score of 5.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
606,cigardener,Long awaited adaptation of Douglas Adams bestseller,7,4 July 2005,"Anyone seeing this movie will be coming from one of two backgrounds: those that are familiar with the works of Douglas Adams in all their various forms, and those who are new to it all. This familiarity, or lack of it, will influence how the movie is received. While I am firmly in the ""familiar"" group, I tried disregard my prejudices and see the movie through the eyes of someone who was just seeing it because the previews piqued their interest. On that basis, I find it to be a pretty good movie--entertaining and humorous with wacky characters and bizarre situations. I recommend it to anyone with a healthy sense of humor. From the point of view of someone familiar with Douglas Adams, the movie can be very disappointing. Some of the greatest lines--things that you were expecting to hear and enjoy again--are missing or mangled and stripped of the laugh. One critic who had written a biography of Adams hated the movie and wrote a review that made it sound like the worst movie ever made. In the unlikely event that you are an Adams fan and you haven't seen this movie yet I would say: go with an open mind and appreciate it when it works and don't get bent out of shape when it doesn't. Keep in mind that this screenplay contains the final installment of Adams life work. If this movie is your introduction to Douglas Adams, I strongly recommend that you explore further. Listen to the radio series, read the books or listen to the audio books read by Adams himself, and check out the BBC television series. For me, the real success of this movie will be measured by the number people who are introduced to this fantastic body of work by it.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
607,religion-is-war,"With the death of the author, they permitted this travesty to see the light of day.",3,24 January 2009,The only good thing about this movie was the casting. Martin Freeman as Arthur Dent was a good choice. Also Alan Rickman as Marvin is the second best casting choice ever in my opinion. Best casting ever was Dylan Moran in Run Fatboy Run (by the way). Other than those two actors and a surprisingly good portrayal of Ford by Mos Def the movie was terrible. Addition of a love element and a villain are still nonsensical to me. Overall just an awful movie. There were certainly elements of Douglas Adams still within but the bulk of this was fabricated and apocryphal to the original. A visit to vogsphere is included for no reason along with the kidnapping of Trillian. I could go on but I'm sure there'r really no need to.,The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
608,oumom10966,Bummer,1,10 July 2005,"If a movie doesn't explain itself within the allotted time frame, why continue trying to become absorbed in it? Why would you have to read a book previous to seeing the movie? Shouldn't the movie explain most, if not everything during the movie? I agree that some things may be changed between the book and the movie. However, there were some things that couldn't be explained, no matter what was said or done. The characters were very different. I know it was an English film and book. The British have a very different sense of humor than we Americans. That doesn't help this film though. I thought the movie was the dumbest thing I'd ever seen. Before I walked out of the movie, at least 3 other people left, after-wards, two others walked out. Face it, that was a terrible film!",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
609,xdarkiex,"Good try, but it could have been better.",7,9 August 2005,"I do actually believe they have read the book before making the movie. The humor of the book is much better and deeper, while in the movie you really have to pay attention to let that ""book"" humor grow onto you, which could be hard when you watched it the first time.I found the film quite amusing, but then again I read the book first which made everything have more sense and makes you understand some undertones of humor. I could imagine that seeing this movie without reading the book first, the movie doesn't make sense. :D As well as acting, well .... it's not that bad, the performance was average all over, some doing much better then others who make it look like they are actually reading the lines at the same time.As for the direction of the movie, well .... going from plot to plot is all could have been made more ""understandable"" and smoother, this probably would made the movie a lot longer.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
610,tony-o-brien,Charmless and chaotic,1,18 January 2006,"Let me just say, for the record, that I have been a Hitchhikers fan since the 1st radio series all those years ago and love all its many iterations - except for this utter dog of a movie. I'm sorry but just can't compare to the TV series, which had charm, wit, elegance and a certain Englishness that marked it out as something special. This movie is all over the place and I'm really disappointed that it was so bad. The acting is, for the most part, wooden - the actors seem to be just going through the motions. Martin Freeman is a poor choice for Arthur Dent - that character is supposed to be middle-aged, what's Martin Freeman, early 30s perhaps? SPOILERS!! The plot has changed into something unrecognisable and incoherent, and major changes have been made to some of the characters, the worst of which is the travesty of Zaphod's heads. Look, Zaphod had TWO heads, not simply an extra one buried under his chin somewhere, but TWO ACTUAL HEADS. I know this might seem minor but it's an important point in letting us know just how ""alien"" Zaphod is.Anyway, I've got the original TV series on DVD so I'll watch that when I want a laugh.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
611,movielover_311,"Great, really great.",8,3 October 2005,"This was an amazing film. I have read all five books in the series and was very excited to hear that they were making a film. I was also excited to hear that they had been working on the script for a long time, so Douglas Adams (the author) got to write the majority of the script before he died. I was glad that he wrote part of the script because other wise I would have been disappointed with the P.O.V. Gun and Humma Kavula. It gives me great relief to know that the author added those characters into the movie, even if they weren't in the book. I loved how almost all of the movie was actors who weren't really famous. I think it's cool that they cast people who had only been in a few films, this way they still had a lot of potential in them. I really hope they make the rest of the books into movies. I even wouldn't mind if they combined a couple of the books, as long as they stayed as faithful to them as they did in this movie. GO SEE THIS MOVIE!",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

If you have not read the books, this movie, being closer to the books than almost any other move has ever been close to its original media, will make you want to read them.The best part of the film is not so much the story but the cast. Mos Def shows the best of his acting skills as the always well-informed Ford Prefect and does a really good job. However, every cast member in the film is dwarfed by the outstanding performance of Sam Rockwell as Zaphod Beeblebrox. While he does not look exactly how the books describe him, he still portrays the 'character' of Zaphod very well. And since Sam Rockwell can steal the show from almost every actor (give or take a few... i.e. Anthony Hopkins) today, but his lines and psychotic personality in this film will be one thing you remember months after seeing it.

617,Je77,There is an art to adapting a book into a movie...,4,4 May 2005,"it involves painstakingly translating sequences which work in book format to work in the high-bandwidth smaller-time-window of the big screen. At the same time, the spirit of the book must remain intact and the movie must be worth seeing. This exercise is even more fiendishly difficult when the book to be adapted is much-loved. The Lord of the Rings movies accomplished this feat, but at tremendous cost and effort. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.As someone who treasures the books, I was sorely disappointed. It wasn't that the filmmakers were badly intentioned; they just were not up to the task. In the book, the Vogons are dangerous. In the film, they are clueless. In the book, you feel Arthur's devastation that the Earth and everything he loves (including tea) is gone. His frustration at trying to get a good cup of tea leads to a really amusing part of the book. In the movie adaptation, this has been reduced to Arthur simply not being able to get anything like tea and then being happy to have tea again. We don't feel his loss. It just doesn't work.That being said, I'm not sure anyone could have gotten this to work (sans the help of an improbability drive). So, if you have the time, skip the flick and go back and read the book again instead.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
618,barrykas,"It's *a* Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, but not *the* Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy",1,15 May 2005,"What can I say? I was prepared to give this version of the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy the benefit of the doubt, given it's a mainly British production, but I was wrong.Sure, it's an okay film, but it bears very little relation to the original material apart from the title and names of the characters.First up, we have the opening musical number to accompany the opening credits. Instead of going for the classic ""Journey of the Sorcerer"" by The Eagles, we have a song, supposedly performed by dolphins, entitled ""So Long and Thanks for all the Fish"".Then there's the excessive amount of product placement for Nokia and Vodafone, which concludes with Arthur's Nokia phone floating in the void of space and filling the whole screen.The Guide entries on itself, Earth and most of the entry on the Infinite Improbability Drive are missing.As for having Mos Def playing Ford, the choice of casting couldn't be any more wrong unless you cast, say, Oprah Winfrey...Ford is described as an alien disguised as a ""typical Englishman"", which Mos Def clearly isn't.Then we have the whole Zaphod ""second head"" thing. Which gets removed by John Malkovich's character and left on a random planet whilst Arthur and co head off to Magrathea, which now has Deep Thought built on it(!) to find some special gun. Once they get said gun, do they return to reclaim Zaphod's head? Nope...It's never mentioned again.Oh...And then at the end, we have Arthur and Trillian getting together, and Zaphod and Questular Rontok getting together...Again, what's with that?In short...As a standalone movie, it's okay, but as a version of Hitchhiker's Guide...it sucks.There are, however, two saving graces...The casting of Bill Nighy as Slartibartfast and Stephen Fry as the voice of the Guide works perfectly. Alan Rickman as the voice of Marvin could have worked, but he delivers the lines too quickly.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

I don't know how good a movie it would be for someone who didn't read the books, however. It might make little sense if any, and seem like a bunch of pointless jokes. It's probably not a very good movie, but it was fun, and contains most of the important lines from the book, if often lacking in explanation.Some visual jokes that could not really be done in the narrative of the book, such as actual images of people lying down on the floor with paper bags over their heads, were great fun.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

You can easily tell where Douglas Adams' dialogue was chopped to bits, and partially replaced with half-baked nonsense from the rewrite team.The opening scene nearly made me leave the theater in disgust. Without spoiling anything, let's just say they made it way too PC.

621,nick-467,Hitchhiker's Guide is born again!,9,22 April 2005,"Well, I'm not a film reviewer. I'm not really a fan of film reviewers as their job involves pretending that there is an objective standard that governs how much everyone will enjoy a film (well, some of them are smart enough not to dress their opinion as anything else). Everyone enjoys films in different ways and I like to use my own judgment to decide if a film is worth my time or not (well, that and the opinions of a few trusted individuals who's taste in films is very similar to my own).So this isn't a review, it's just my honest reaction to the film and you may judge for yourselves if my opinion is likely to be similar to your own.I loved it. There were a couple of small points that I wasn't happy with but there was so much that I really enjoyed that I left the cinema very happy indeed. It has a very frantic pace, especially when compared to the glacial pace of the TV series. But, in my opinion, it works.I'll now talk about different aspects of the film.The Cast. Each member of the cast has brought a new interpretation of their character to the film but they are still definitely the same characters. Martin Freeman is very funny but also very human. He's less of a caricature of Britishness than Simon Jones's interpretation.Mos Def is an excellent laid back Ford who occasionally has slightly manic (David Dixon style) moments. I don't think everyone will like his delivery of some of the lines as he can be very dead-pan at times but I found him very watchable and likable.Sam Rockwell's Zaphod is either lovable or irritating depending on your loony-tolerance. I found his over-the-top performance was just perfect for Zaphod, and frequently had me in stitches.Zooey Deschanel. Mmmm....Zooey. She's the best Trillian ever! She's adorable, funny, charming, intelligent and finally has an emotional depth that was missing from all other incarnations. She works well with both Zaphod and Arthur and their interactions were believable.Bill Nighy gave a performance that managed to be nothing like Richard Vernon's yet at the same time definitely Slartibartfast. Very funny. Very human.Stephen Fry is someone who I new would be good. He has the intelligence needed to get the delivery right and a mysterious gentle voice (like God has popped round for a cup of tea).The Effects, sets and puppets. Wonderful. I loved the Vogon puppets, it made them seem much more real than any CG character (yes, even Gollum). The sets looked great and there is one nice tracking shot down a Vogon corridor that shows just how huge the set was. Every set is packed with detail, I cannot wait for the DVD. The Magrathea 'factory floor' is breathtaking - especially on the big-screen. Zaphod's second head isn't brilliantly executed but it didn't bother me much.The Guide entries. I'm a big Shynola fan. I was extremely excited when I learned that they would be doing the guide entries. I wasn't disappointed - the guide entries look great and are packed with the inventive wit that characterises Shynola's work. The way they visually interpret the words of the guide entries is very clever and matches the wit of the original animations in the TV series but with a more modern approach.The Music. The Dolphin song at the start was wonderful. Call me a softy but a couple of the lines nearly brought a tear to my eye. The music for the guide entries fit really well. The new orchestrated version of Journey of the Sorcerer is great. I was too wrapped up in the experience to really notice the music, I'll have to see it again (or buy the soundtrack)! Editing. The film flies along at an incredible pace but for me it never suffered from the 'why are we here now?' problem that some film (The Phantom Menace) suffer from. I really couldn't tell you how someone new to Hitchhiker's Guide might react. The destruction of the Earth is particularly well handled, managing to be both funny and moving.Stuff I didn't like. Not much really. Part of me craves for the inclusion of things that other parts of me recognise will make the film less effective. One thing that I felt was a shame is that certain added plot elements make the story less bleak. These plot elements actually come from later books in the series so they weren't un-Hitchhiker-y but they contributed to a more optimistic story than I am familiar with from other versions. But this is a minor quibble and it didn't spoil my enjoyment of the film. Though I really liked Zaphod, I didn't really like the second head. It didn't work as well as it might have. Still, it was preferable to a shoulder-mounted permanent extra head - which would have been wrong for many reasons.Conclusion. It is The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy reborn with a new energy. It is lighter than previous incarnations but still retains most of what I love about the story. It also adds a brilliant level of visual inventiveness that matches the aural inventiveness of the original radio series. People expecting the TV series but with better effects will be disappointed. This is a new beginning. The Hitchhiker's Guide is alive again, it is an enormous shame on a galactic scale that Douglas isn't here to enjoy it. The huge applause after the film showed I wasn't alone in having a good time.Also, the film contains my favourite line. It previously only occurs in the second radio series (as far as I know) and is moved to a different occasion but I was dead chuffed when I heard it!",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

I think Zooey Deschanel was a great choice for Trillian (I loved her in Elf, too!).The Guide itself was depicted creatively.

623,caebaker1,"Fun movie, but in the end it wasn't Hitchhikers Guide",4,9 April 2006,"As a stand alone movie, it was decent, a few chuckles and some fun, but it was not Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy. My main reason for saying this is that only on occasion, and rare occasion at that, did the movies dialog actually sound like it was from the books. If you have ever read Hitchhiker, then you know that the true charm of the novel is Dougles Adams writing style, and the movie only captured that essence in a few lines, the rest was just something completely different and not Adams'esquire. I personally was disappointed from the very first scene of bulldozing Mr. Dent's home, in the book Adams writes a brilliant scene in which Ford Prefect convinces the foreman to take Dent's place on the ground protesting the demolishment of Arther's home. In the movie, they sum it up with a trite and bland scene with Ford giving away beer to the construction crew. Instead of adapting Adams brilliant and witty banter to the big screen, they resort to a simpler scene that is easy, easy on the writers, easy to understand and in the end bland.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
624,thewaever,A decent movie,6,7 May 2005,"Although this isn't meant as a literal translation of the books or of any of the earlier Hitchhiker's workers, it's hard not to compare it to the BBC 1981 mini series, so that's what I'll do.First off, the actors & their characters... Martin Freeman is a very good Arthur Dent. Freeman was excellently bland for this character. I especially liked the Magrathea gateway scene. Of course, Simon Jones is Arthur Dent. The man played Arthur in every other production of the Guide; there's just no comparing, so I'll stop right here. Zooey Deschanel's Trillian was very nice. I especially liked the way that she was pretty without being a supermodel about it. It's not the usual sort of ""hot, frumpy secretary"" thing either. She was more of a person than that. The 1981 version of the Guide, Sandra Dickison's Trillian was an intelligent character, but a little too submissive to take entirely seriously. I liked how Deschanel could bring the President of the Galaxy to heal, face down the monstrous Vogons & still have the energy to scream angrily at them all the while she was being executed. I've heard a lot of people say that Trillian was meant to be Arabic, or even African, but you just have to remember that Douglas Adams never took himself too literally. I have to admit, it would've been interesting to see an Arabic actress take the part. It would've lent Trillian a more exotic feel. Mos Def was a surprising, but interesting choice for Ford Prefect. Unfortunately, the character was relegated to supporting role, rather than the major character that David Dixon enjoyed in the 1981 version of the Guide. On the other hand, I could never see how Dixon's Ford could keep up with the spectacular Zaphod Beeblebrox. Them being cousins was a bit of a stretch, too. Now, Mos Def could keep up with this new ZB & then some. My favorite moment was when these two guys first met & they had their little greeting dance. T'was cool! Mos Def's acting was good, too, although a bit spotty in places. He had the most lines in the opening scenes, but I felt he didn't really deliver them so much as threw them away. I know the character was supposed to be worried & anxious, but Mos Def could've put a little more force into it. Some of the best lines got swallowed up. Later on in the movie, though, Mos Def's Ford shined in his scenes with ZB & the scene where he fought off the Vogons with nothing but a towel was great (if short lived). Now for the Man, Zaphod Beeblebrox! Sam Rockwell did a great job bringing the manic charisma of the character out. It was fun watching him schmooze his was through all his problems... to a point. That was all this version of the character could do, literally breaking down when his schmoozing didn't work. Mark Wing-Davey brought a more coherent ZB to the screen in the 1981 Guide. Plus the obviously fake, but campy-fun second head & third arm brought an interesting look to him. The story... In this new version of the Guide, there's a lot less of Douglas Adams' commentary, which I missed. The Babel fish was included in the 2005 Guide, but the hilarious comment on religion & ""puffs of logic"" is conspicuously gone. Speaking of other jokes & comments that are gone from the new version of the Guide, there's the bypass plans being ""displayed"" in the bottom of a locked drawer guarded by a leopard, Zaphod's glasses that turn opaque when danger approaches, the importance of towels, & I didn't like that Zaphod already knew what happened to his brain. The 2005 Guide is more of a love story than a science fiction adventure. Dent is the main character, who fell in love with Trillian, who was stolen away by Zaphod, who Dent rather dislikes. The character, Dent, is very much a stick in the mud, a person who is mediocre in every way. I didn't exactly realize he was the main character until half-way through the movie. Up until then, I was wondering why they were spending so much time on a character that is no more interesting than his bathrobe wardrobe. It was nice to see Trillian have a bigger role, though. Like I said before, Deschanel really brought the character to life, giving her more respectability than the earlier Trillian. That being said, I had trouble seeing why Dent was so devoted to her after a chance encounter at a party that had (apparently) happened some years before. Not to mention, Zaphod doesn't even seem to notice or care that Arthur's gunning for ""his"" girl. On special effects... We never really see the Vogons. That's probably a good thing, since when we did get a better view of them, they looked like someone had just tied a trash bag up over their head & was trying to run around being threatening with chopsticks as arms. They had me wondering if that was the best they could do. It was too bad the Vogons were featured so much in the movie. The other aliens were much the same way, looking like a hurried, thrown together attempt at outer space. It could be that the alien department was trying to capture the campy feel of the 1981 Guide, but if that was the case the excellent, modern quality to the spaceships & John Malkovich's Humma Kavula ruined that. All in all... Not a bad film, but a little disappointing. I feel the story would've been better if they had dropped the love triangle bit, & concentrated more on the original story line. The ending just screamed sequel, though. I'm looking forward to the Restaurant at the End of the Universe.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

628,knomadd,Don't Panic...,8,30 April 2005,"Don't Panic Going to see The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy I had a fear that it would not live up to all of the previous forms it has taken (radio show and scripts, books, & BBC mini-series). However knowing that none of these were entirely the same to begin with it makes it hard to be upset with alterations. Although many things were changed, many liberties were taken I felt it to be an enjoyable ride. For those that haven't seen it, read it, heard it, or heard of it that is something you will have to cope with by correcting this sad error as quickly as you can, before it's too late (I'd guess you have until Thursday). My only concern is that the continuity has been altered in such a way that if further volumes are to be added they may cause difficulties for the fans like myself that have been around since the beginning to recognize as being from the previous works (after all the ""based on"" sited the book as it's source). You see, I had read these books in my youth as each book was fresh and new. I have not only heard (and own a copy of) the radio show but have performed from the scripts on the radio myself with other enthusiasts. I am not trying to brag or say I'm the bigger fan, I'm just saying that I do know something about the material. I would very much like to see subsequent volumes in film form, if for no other reason than to see how it all comes together (considering the liberties taken), not to mention a very loaded DVD release.

Actually from the trailer it didn't seem like something I was interested in seeing but I was delightfully surprised. It is original, yes it is a remake, but there is no movie like it that came out in 2005 or any of the previous 10-15 years that I can think of, which is refreshing because the movie industry can be trite at times. It is funny, entertaining and interesting from beginning to end with no scenes that ""drag"" or cause the viewer to lose interest. All of the actors give good performances but the one that stood out to me was that of Alan Rickman as the voice of Marvin the robot, Rickman's deep melancholy voice perfectly fit the character of Marvin. There is one criticism that I have heard people give the film and that is the rescue of Trillian. At first I agreed that fact that they were able to save her by just filling out a form was too simple and anti-climactic but I think this just adds to the originality of the movie. In any other movie there would have been some big over dramatic and predictable scene, but sometimes in life problems have simple solutions. Overall I give the movie 8.5 stars out of ten, ""The hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy"" is a spectacle for the eyes, ears, and mind.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
631,erin_bingham,The genius of Adams shines on...,7,28 April 2005,"Having read the books and seen the bbc series I went into HHGG with an open mind. I guess knowing that Douglas Adams played a major part in the screen writing helped ease it. Those expecting a literal translation from the book will be disappointed - but don't forget there is no ONE version of this story. The movie uses much from both the book and the series, with some added bits. The new bits help the story flow much more easily and do not detract from the HHGG random and strange narrative. It's almost as if they were always intended to be there.As for the actors: I thought Martin Freeman was great as Arthur. Mos Def was a little bit out of place, as was Zooey Deschanel. I guess that's because I had set versions of their characters in my head. Sam Rockwell had me laughing as a great, if a little dumber, version of Zaphod. John Malkovich is creepy, as always, in the new role of Humma Kavula. The Vogons were well imagined, pretty much looking exactly how I pictured them when I first read the books.The highlight of the film for me, however, was The Whale. I could not think of anyone other then Bill Bailey to do this part and it had me laughing harder then any other scene.One thing I was disappointed with was Alan Rickman's Marvin, though to be honest I'm not sure why. I always considered Marvin's depression to be a funny twist, but in this it's just kind of...annoying? I dunno. It's hard to explain.The utter weirdness is what attracted me to HHGG in the first place, and it's still there in this film. All in all I enjoyed it, and will be seeing it again.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
632,remi_sheepies,"Martin Freeman is a perfect Arthur Dent,",8,3 May 2005,"Martin Freeman is a perfect Arthur Dent, I can't think of another actor around right at this moment that would have been able to play him so well. The big deal about (shock horror) Mos Def playing Ford Prefect, in my opinion was stupid. I will admit I was a little shocked, no wrong word, surprised at the casting but really only because when you read a book you picture the people in your own mind, and though the book makes no reference to Fords skin colour, I pictured him white don't ask me why I just did. But I think he did a brilliant job, and at the end of the day that's all that matters. He did this strange accent, you know that it's primarily an American accent but there's another thing thrown in and you're not quite sure what, an upper class posh edge perhaps.It did kind of perplex me though that all other main characters were American. But what did I expect when it's bought by America for mass appeal. But then again Zaphod was exactly as I imagined him, it was a bit gutting that the second head was hidden for most of the time as was his third arm,(ii know it would have been too costly to CGI these in the movie) but still it worked. The only character that didn't work as well as I hoped was Marvin. He didn't ooze misery, I loved him in the books his sarcasm his self-pitying, I loved him so much in the books I could have killed him. But in the film well wait until you see it, I personally don't think it worked as well as it could and should have.The visual effects and Vorgons were non-surpassable; honest, certain scenes will blow you away, Jim Hensons company did the puppets so you know for a fact that it's the unofficial seal of excellence. The League of Gentlemen do the voices of the vorgons, there's one that you will think Tubs straight away. The ""Guide"" bits as well animated and a good choice of narrator, Stephen Fry, because his voice seems to represent knowledge for some reason.Any how my favourite bit is when a nuclear warhead turns into a sperm whale and you hear what its thinking as it falls through the sky, its voiced by Bill Bailey and its brilliant.

634,bugonguitar,Mostly a general rebuttal; FROUGHT WITH SPOILERS.,8,4 May 2005,"(Note: my assessments assume that this film was made with an eye toward sequels. Further, this review is intended as a counterpoint to many of the views I've seen thus far, assumes the film has already been seen by the reader, and thus is spoiler-heavy.)This film was far from perfect (or even Prefect), but I think we need to cut it some slack, because it had a pretty high set of expectations to live up to.It had to please the legions of die-hard Douglas Adams nuts like me, each waiting to eviscerate those in charge if his particular definition of what's essential about the books (and the radio show, and the TV series) was not properly represented. At the same time, it had to lay out a linear, accessible plot for people who've never picked up one of the books and are attracted mostly by the bright colors and flashing images.Could it have been better in either respect? Certainly. Was it a miserable failure on either count? Hardly.I'm a screenwriter, and I've spent a lot of time ruminating over what I'd do if I got these books in my hands to adapt. The fundamental problem is that every incarnation so far has been very literary in nature, heavily depending on wordy, expository dialogue and lengthy narration. Either of these things usually spells instant death in a film unless they're done very well (see Shawshank Redemption). And, there are so many fun, quirky things which spring from these two sources in the earlier material that working them all into the film would've been impossible without committing cinematic suicide.There were some new threads whose relevance I couldn't quite understand. Humma Kavula seemed like an awfully large diversion simply to allow for a (literal) plot device down the line. Both Trillian's realization that she'd possibly blown it with Arthur and the turning of the Vogons could've been accomplished otherwise.This among other things leads me to believe that Humma's role is more important down the road. Humma's brief appearance along with the quick cameo (brilliantly accomplished by Jason Schwartzman, I thought) of Gag Halfrunt hint of a growing axis of evil to be exploited in later films. It seems logical that these two forces would come together, find a way to make the Vogons do their bidding, and prevent the Ultimate Question from ever being revealed ('cause let's face it, who benefits more from doubt and uncertainty in the Galaxy than psychiatrists and religious fanatics?).I balked at first at the relationship between Arthur and Trillian, but I realized that a) it worked, b) it was necessary in order to keep Arthur from coming off as a complete whiner (as he does quite often in the books), and c) it affords the opportunity to make Arthur truly and justifiably miserable down the road when they're ripped apart at the end of the second book (film).I think the film portrayed the Vogons better than any of the previous works, because there seems to be some incongruity between Adams' descriptions of the Vogons and their actual behavior. The film made them seem exactly like a race of people who would not lift a finger to save their grandmother from the Ravenous Bugbladder Beast of Traal without orders signed in triplicate, etc. Breaking for lunch just before launching a pursuit of the HoG was particularly brilliant (especially the throw away line as the scene ended ""I think I'll have soup today"" that just hit me as really funny).I loved Arthur and Ford being turned into sofas upon being sucked up by the HoG. Yes, I'd've loved to see the wobbly South End/Ford's a penguin bit, but the practical implications of filming that sequence would give anyone a nightmare. Plus, DNA seemed to have an affinity for sofas which bordered on obsession, so it was a nice touch.The opening sequence was a surprise and certainly a catchy tune. I can't say I'd've done it, but it was a nice risk and an interesting way of letting the newbies know straight off that the universe you think you inhabit has little or nothing to do with what you're about to see.I missed the ""Far out on the unfashionable end of the western spiral arm of the Galaxy..."" bit, as that's one of my favorite passages in all the books, but I trust it'll come up later.We missed a bit of Trillian and Ford being the level-headed members of the group. They all seemed to simply be victims of improbability more often than not, whereas in the books (and the radio show) occasionally they'd think their way out of trouble (usually with Trillian and Ford doing the bulk of the thinking).I think the biggest problem I had was with the Earth Mark II. In the framework of a single film it works, but on the larger scale it presents problems, especially with the dolphins returning. But, I'm willing to concede such things, because the first film in a trilogy (or quintology if they take it that far) has to stand on its own in case the others never get made. Besides, it's not like Adams never wrote himself into and out of a corner.On the whole, the film was a good effort. I laughed quite a bit, and the changes and new material kept the story fresh without fatally altering it (as each new incarnation has done before). There is a certain amount one can expect to be lost in translation, especially when the source material is so densely populated with lunacy and brilliance. I think it is (much like Dune) easier to enjoy if you've read the books, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. I just hope they continue the series and justify some of my assumptions.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

The few they did attempt they screwed up by not using the setup material. Guys!! You can't just tell the punchline!!! Case in point, the entire guide entry involving the Vogons (...lost, found, lost again and buried in peat moss, etc...). This originally was set up by the exchange between Prosser and Dent regarding the plan's display at the local planning office (""...past a locked door marked ""Beware of the Leopard!!""). All they used was ""I had to go to the cellar!"" They missed the joke entirely by not telling all of it.Waaaaaaay to much time was spent with the Vogons. And just exactly who the heck was Malkovich's character anyway?Casting was so so at best. I was really prepared to like Sam Rockwell as Zaphod and was thoroughly disappointed. I can't help but think that Jack Davenport would have been the ultimate Arthur Dent, but maybe that's just me.

636,Sketch105,My doubts disappeared in a puff of logic,8,16 May 2005,"The movie's critics befuddle me. While most of them claim to be fans of Adams work and know every line, they refuse to appreciate the film for the rollicking good time it is. Its not the citizen Kane of Sci-Fi comedy, but it has enough for fans to adore. I would like to counterpoint the film's most outrageous criticisms: Mos Def as Ford Prefect- This was my favorite thing about this film. Mos hits the nail on the head with his slapstick and awkward attempts at being human. I can't imagine anyone better for the part. Most of the purists were mad with his casting because they couldn't accept that a black American actor would step into the part of Ford, but if they'd ever caught ""The Italian Job"" they would have seen the potential. Every awkward gesture and every facial expression (the Vogon poetry reactions: priceless!) had me giggling with delight.Zaphod Beeblebrox's stupidity- Several film journalists have objected to Zaphod's personality being tinkered with. While the books vision was a purely eccentric and egotistical, the film centers his personality on those two traits and a bit of stupidity. This has outraged some fans, but below it is a social satire on our current situation. As Humma Kuvula put it ""Once again, it is proved that good looks and charm win over intelligence and ability to govern"". Think about it and think about the past four years of our government, and it truly creates a subtext. This is what movie-making is about. Not only reflecting material but the ability for social satire, which is what Adams was all about. Rockwell even says in interviews his performance was based on Elvis and George Bush.The Love Triangle- True, the beginnings are a bit drawn out with the party sequence (the nod to Darwin is cool though, along with the record gag), but it ties the loose ends together and gives Trillian purpose. She was the least interesting character in the first book, merely tagging along with the true characters of Ford and Zaphod and even Marvin. Here, she serves a bit more purpose, being a catalyst for Arthur to change along his journey. You had Arthur, the last man from Earth, and Trillian, the last woman from Earth, and you never saw them get together. While I applauded Douglas for avoiding any romance in his books, the movie adaptation helps give a little life to the relationship of the last two people from earth and creates a cute little sidenote to Adam's ideals about life and its purpose. We may not know the answer, but a little chemical reaction between two apelike descendants may help keep us busy enough not to care.The Book- The movie is titled after the book which drives the film. If it wasn't for these diversions, the movie would make little sense as a true reflection of the book. The book is based on refelcting the characters and there circumstances, and in turn without it the events that take place have little weight. Imagine the characters going on random rants of exposition about Babelfish and Magrathea instead of having the book play a role, and you might agree this was the best way to incorporate the best parts of the book.The missing lines- Everyone has a favorite line, and not everyone's favorite was included. Mine, in which the fact that God doesn't exist because of the Babelfish (QED) is simply left out because the scene occurs so early in the film, it would take too long to put it in. Others simply would have drawn out the film longer then it had too. The biggest complaint is the argument in which Ford and Arthur talk to a Vogon about why his life is so good ""Well, now that I think about it, the actual minutes are lousy"". Again, too early in the film and would draw it out.The film at best is faithful in spirit contains everything a fan should want. Cameos by the TV stars of the mini-series: Check. An overall British sense of humor: Check. British actors: Check. Dolphins and mice: Check. There are so many little things to love about this movie, from the inclusion of the crabs on the Vogsphere, the crowd at the Deep Thought revelation (love the ""Think Deep"" shirts) Eddie the shipboard computer, the pod driving sequence, the Jim Henson creatures, the satire of the Catholic Church! I was happy enough that the Sperm Whale scene was entirely made for the film, despite the fact that, once again, it had nothing to do with the main characters. It takes guts to make that kind of diversion while most directors cut anything out that doesn't drive the plot of their film.This movie could have been a Cat-in-the-Hat sized mistake but thanks to Garth Jennings, we have a really good film that preserves Adams spirit and sense of humor.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

I give this movie 9/10 stars because it is funny. The acting is great, Mos Def makes great Ford. The only problem with the movie is the decision to have zooey deschanel play trillian. She acts the same in every single scene, it gets annoying after a while. Alan Rickman was great choice for the voice of marvin, he did it perfectly.

Well I can't believe Dooglas Adams himself wrote the script. I was able to laugh a bit mostly because I had read the book and was able to get the joke from the book, as the movie did not contain the Ironie and Paradox the book contains.The way it was scripted is probably because Americain peoples are not intelligent enough and subtle to understand all of what the Britsih humor can contained. Well to me this movie is a Deep deception, and aside the special effect nothing much is to get from it.I am very glad I read the books (all 5 of them), I had a good laugh almost every 2 pages. In the movie, I was kind of bored. They did not follow the books. The informations either missing or out of sequence. The plot was changed to include a story line that can't be reconcile in anyway with the books in any further movie they might decide to do.So if you are a typical Americain that only special effect get your interest go see it.

641,stevensams95,Loved It,10,25 May 2009,"I am a devoted fan to The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy and have read all the books and has also heard that there will be a 6th book in Trilogy which is going to be written by Eoin Colfer, anyway I thought that Hammer and Tongs did an incredible job of the movie everything about was in my eyes was perfect. It captured the initial wit and originality that the books offered in a lovely way. My main reason for thinking the film was great is the casting: Martin Freeman is one of my favourite actors and he brings Arthur Dent a lot of justice. Mos Def gets Fords happy-go-lucky persona brilliantly and Sam Rockwell does absolutely amazingly well in the role of Zaphod Beeblebrox, bringing a collage of characters into his character such as Bill Clinton, Elvis Presley and George W. Bush into one. In one word, Superb!",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
642,Chiaraes,I LOVED it... don't know about you. Have you read it?,8,30 April 2005,"I'm going to open myself up to criticism and just blurt out the following personal fact: I welled up inside at the opening scene. I have waited since 1985 when I first heard rumors of a movie and was just put away by this. Perfect as could be.As the film went on I enjoyed every moment of it.So, why an 8 instead of a 10? I've been through several renditions of the work. I've seen the variations in the stories and even the dismissal of the second radio series as a delusion in the third series, and could make sense of it. I was in tune with this movie. It was a wonderful companion to the other stories, but overly dependent.When I saw ""Dune"", I enjoyed it, but didn't ""get it"". I later read the book, and many years later saw it again. Then, I totally got it. As if it were a different film! That's what I'm afraid of with this film. It's all there with key phrases and comments. But much of the humor was cut short, left to be filled in by the experience of people like me. They entirely left out Ford Prefect's career, something more important for later sequels. They left out the philosophers. Not just incidental items, these were key to the plot.Those new to this, did you ""get it"" or just find it funny in a quirky kind of way?",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

Errr... real pretty crap...,5,5 May 2005,"The loss of biting British humor and the simple fact that it's impossible to bring the Hitchhiker's universe to the big screen within the magic ""2 hour"" dough-earning window keep the Guide from transcending any real Hollywood clichés, despite great performances from those imprisoned within its green-backed walls.However, the special effects are pretty... but I think we're to the point now in movie-making that decent special effects have become a foregone conclusion.

It had the same humor & many of the same lines as the show. Sam Rockwell was very good as Zaphod ,displaying the ego & flair even more-so than the series.Alan Rickmans voice was the perfect choice as Marvin's (the paranoid robot)voice. The political satire is more obvious here in the movie-showing the vogons as a ""red tape ""social order-unable to complete a simple task without the proper forms.Also, the special effects were much better than the TV show. The vogons are even more disgusting .

645,wutscher0815,I think you ought to know that I'm feeling very depressed...,4,8 May 2005,"After years of waiting, the Hitchhiker's Guide has finally made it to the big Screen, but the outcome is far from living up to my expectations...Well, I really loved the design of the picture, the Apple-style Heart-of Gold interior, Vogsphere, which looks like the nightmare sequences of Gilliam's Brazil, Margrathea, with its amazing cgi-factory-floor and the cheesy waiting lounge. Also, the animated guide entries are really funny (but sadly enough, they were about the only thing that really made me laugh) and most of the main characters were well cast. Now for the bad parts: In an interview producer Nick goldsmith said, when asked about the comedy in the film "" With the material, I don't think we're going to have a problem with that one."", but apparently, they did: some of the funny lines are mumbled, so that they are disfigured beyond being understandable, other -new- lines just aren't funny, there's a lot of unnecessary bad physical comedy, and very often really funny lines from the books or the radioseries are just left out. What the film also lacks is storytelling: While hammer and tongs have proved that they can make really fine shorts, their first feature length film just lacks of charm and a good plot, that keeps the story together, neither the quest for the ultimate question nor the lovestory is strong enough to make a consistent story out of the chain of events, that we're facing here...One thing in particular that annoyed me was the camera and the editing: I'm not really an expert in those things, but it really annoyed me that there was hardly ever a shot that lasted more than two seconds, so I never could really enjoy the stupendous sets built for this movie.All in all the movie left the impression on me that there was a lot of ambition and fun involved in making this movie, but it failed, because they tried to make the film rather ""cool"" than grotesque British comedy, so all I got from the picture was a big eye-candy almost but not quite unlike a bock that I really enjoyed reading a million times.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

647,bjlevine,Lower Your Expectations and You'll Have a Good Time,7,17 May 2005,"Having been a rabid fan of the radio series, books and TV series, I went to the movie with a bit of trepidation. After all, I've already had to live through the Star Wars Prequels. But I quickly realized that this was going to largely be a different story with different characters and situations (save for Marvin and Eddie). A lot of the witty dialogue that Douglas Adams is known for is dropped in favor of faster paced action. The characterizations are definitely a mixed bag: Spoiler Warning - don't read if you don't want to know! Arthur is treated differently here. He is not the hopelessly clueless fussy Englishman as brilliantly portrayed by Simon Jones. He is more of any everyman, which tends to fit this story well.Ford is a bit of a disappointment as he does little but take up space, and has almost none of the laid back otherworldliness that we've come to expect from the character. He still takes everything in stride, but we never get the feeling that he is perfectly at home with the galactic madness around him.Prepare yourself for a very different Trillian, but not in an unlikable way. Here she is more relatable, and in Arthur's eyes, more attainable.The one character that Guide fans are likely to have problems with is Zaphod, who seems horribly misinterpreted here. Rather than the larger-than-life, self-absorbed, ego-maniacal party animal that we've known in all the previous incarnations, Zaphod is portrayed as a zoned out Surfer dude. In the earlier works Zaphod lights up everything about the story, but here he is the biggest weakness to the story. Its as if the writers were determined that Zaphod's character never outshine Arthur in the story, and in doing so, all of his charm went out the window.In any case, once I got over my initial reaction to the changes (and counting places where terrific dialogue was dropped), I found that I still enjoyed the movie. So grab your towel, lower your expectations and you may be pleasantly surprised.Two and a half Stars (out of four)",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
648,Surferdude5269,Pretty Good,6,30 April 2005,"I'm one of the biggest hitchhiker's fans around, and the book is like my bible. This movie was probably better than a 6, but I'm grading it on potential. What annoyed me was the not the way the movie was made, but the script was written. Some of the best lines in the book weren't skipped over, they were rewritten and changed. Like Ford's original explanation to get Arthur from out of the bulldozer, explaining to the guy that it really doesn't matter if he's there anyway. There's a lot of small things like that. Plus, it's way to sappy. The book is a interesting and honest perspective on the world, and it views love as dangerous. The movie shows two people who become each other's ""ONES"" within a period of a few days. It's so different from the way the book was, talking about the three-breasted whore from...I can't remember where. Also, I REALLY HATED how they brought the earth back in the end. How will this be explained when the earth is a semi-dimensional thing in the fifth book? It just doesn't make sense. Anyway, casting was good though, but Marvin's attitude dragged on a bit too much I think. Good, like I said, pretty good, not bad, but...on potential, it's average.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

I'm not saying this to be some filthy fanboy, or to think that I'm better than you. I'm not, and I'm not. But there aren't many people that have that little green dude as a tattoo to remind them of why they wanted to be a writer. Of course, it isn't exactly faithful to the books, and of course, there is poetic license abound in the film, but any real fan should thank their lucky stars that a film adaptation was actually made. A story such as this, mired in production hell for twenty years or so, was lucky to come out as faithful to the book as it did. When I first saw a terrible ghastly silence, a terrible ghastly noise, a terrible ghastly silence, I cried a little. So often in your head things don't appear as they do on screen, but that one moment sold me. I called my dad after I saw the film, the man who introduced me to HHG2G, and told him that he would feel good about the adaptation, not because it was perfect, but because it was there, and they tried. Anyone who really appreciates HHG2G will like this film, regardless of its shortcomings. Having said that, it's still a good film, and it's still well worth a watch if you aren't familiar with the series. If you like Sci-Fi humor, then at the very least, rent it.

650,davekh,A good job and nice touches,9,28 April 2005,"Just home from the pre-view evening in the UK - I really enjoyed the film, all the respect to Douglas Adams was given thankfully. Plenty of references outside of the film too added a touch of humour at other levels. Seeing Doublas Adams welcoming unwelcome visitors with two nuclear missiles brought a smile, watch closely.The start proved complete and the demolition of Earth actually felt a twinge of loss - that worked well. All the characters were satisfying - I never really pictured a Vogon while listening to the radio or read a book. Speaking of references outside of the film - was that a version of a Spitting Image Margaret Thatcher I saw in the jail office? Which 60s English film star was that in the face of the chief Vogon. I laughed at the variety of robots & creature in the jail queue - an S&M Mr Blobby? (American people please search on Noel Edmonds for more info). Was that the original Marvin near the front of the queue in one shot? I was laughing too much to see the rest.The League of Gentlemen characters seemed to feature as Vogons - a neat little feature. The book - I wondered how it would be featured - no excess technology thankfully. The humour - another pulse of English humour to hit the US, please enjoy and don't take it too seriously. Then again, do, please.Thanks for your humour and foresight dna@cix.co.uk and for writing it all down! Now - whens the next book coming along please! Dave",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
651,paonasheso,Enough,2,5 September 2005,"I know that every marketing research, every focus group and ever comity will say ""You have to have a love story! Love should save the day etc"" but this is a very nice book written by a guy with great humour and a very important writer. What we don't need is another great book or story turned is into a ""boy saves the girl, they fall in love, love is stronger than vogons and they live happily ever after"". Enough.Adding bits and pieces to make for a nicer movie is OK, but changing the whole plot, taking out every clever or controversial bit, and adding your own, not so successful, plot elements or gadgets of is way beyond that.I mean, really, is ""The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"" about how Arthur falls in love with Trilian, rescues her from the Vongons and Marvin saving the day using point of view gun ?If you haven't read the book then you probably enjoyed a nice comedy, lots of nice scenery etc but there are lots of films like that. This particular one was supposed to be ""The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"" which should be about the story in the book with the same name, and definitely be a lot more than what this film was.It's a shame that every major film based on a great book or comics book should suffer the same treatment: remove any of the plot that might require any significant amount of thought to follow, remove any controversial elements, add stupid jokes of your own and make it all a big love story.What I don't understand is how anyone who's read the book could vote with anything above 2 or 3. As the ""The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"" it fails, as an original film its about average. Special effects and photography was OK though.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
652,jnf23,A film which could have been so much more...,7,26 April 2005,"**Very Mild Spoilers**I've been a fan of the guide for as long as I can remember, and the TV series is even older than I am, so I've grown up with the books, the tapes of the radio plays and later the DVDs and videos of the TV series, and so I can say in all seriousness I've been waiting for this film for half for my life. And that's why I'm so disappointed by it. But wait? I've given it 7 out of 10? Well yes, but despite it being a poor version of Hitchhiker's....it's still a version of Hitchhiker's and it has moments of pure genius. The problem with the film is that it has too many of these little moments taken out to give it laugh out loud lines and replaced with jokes that seem to be aimed no higher than the 9 year old who sat in front of me. ""Lend us a hand, Marvin"" says (the well cast Freemen as)Arthur Dent, before promptly ripping his arm off. Now yes, mildly amusing, but was it really worth putting that in in place of classic lines such as ""What's so unpleasant about being drunk? Ask a glass of water"". There are saving graces to this film: the mind staggers at some of the CGI scenes particularly the scenes on Magrathea (although don't get me started on the changing of the 'plot' to include Vogons at every turn). Sam Rockwell makes an excellently annoying Zaphod, although the second head approach appeared just lazy even compared to the BBC's plastic lump! The star of the show was ultimately Bill Nighy, stealing it with a superb little appearance as Slartibartfast; but he shouldn't have been the star of the show: Douglas Adams and his wonderful stories and ideas and lines should have been. Somewhere along the way this got lost.All in all, I probably had too high expectations for this film, but I still feel it could have been so much more. And I only hope that people go back and re-examine the radio plays, the TV series and the books especially those who've never known the pleasure of a Pan-Galactic Gargle Blaster!",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
653,ldyrynn,Manage your expectations,8,19 September 2005,"I am always apprehensive about seeing a screen adaptation of a beloved book, so I was almost afraid to see this. I've read all the 'Hitchhikers' books at least three times and I love Douglas Adams' humor. I'd also seen the BBC series many years ago and loved it. So, we bought the movie yesterday and watched it last night. I can't imagine seeing the movie without having read at least the first book...it just wouldn't make any sense. In a nutshell, I found the movie at least as zany as the book and imbued throughout with Adams' wacky sense of humor and sarcasm.NPR ran a Talk of the Nation segment on the movie/book, etc. on the day before it opened and talked to many people who were either involved with the movie, were Hitchhiker 'experts' (how terrifying is that??) or mega-fans. Some liked it, some didn't. The main thing that came out, however, is how very involved Adams had been with the screenplay, etc. for this venture. It had been in the works for years prior to his death and it was his baby. I think the producers did it right.If you're going into this movie with the idea that it will be a line by line adaptation of the book, you won't like it. If you suspend your expectations and look at this as a merry romp through absurdity, you'll love it.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

It definitely had a Monty Python feel to it although Monty is in a category in of itself. I loved the little animated parts, that was probably the funniest parts I remember.

655,kingoftheducks,"Gloriously Daft, Gleefully Barmy, Big, Fat, Fun!!! Perfect Popcorn...",9,1 May 2005,"I haven't heard the radio series, I haven't read the books, I haven't seen the TV show, and I suck really badly at the computer game (I had to cheat to get into the Vogon washroom). But, from being an internet monkey I know a fair deal about what to expect, though at the same time I have absolutely no clue whatsoever. This film is one that is quite unlike anything I've seen in the blockbuster season, which is both a good thing and a bad. Why, do you ask, is it both? Well, I shall answer that 'ultimate question' later. :)Where do I begin? Well, I begin at the beginning, the film opens fantastically with Stephen Fry's glorious tones making a very witty and very dry guide to the world of the film, and then we are plunged into a Python-esquire (Think 'Every Sperm Whale Is Sacred') musical number which may confuse many, but had me in a giggles and also as the title appeared sent a shiver down my spine. This punch of excitement is something that is a little lacking later in the film, as plots become entwined in much the same way as your food becomes entwined in a vomit (yes, that's one of the film's flaws). But, anyway...We are speedily introduced to Arthur Dent (Martin Freeman from 'The Office') and his performance is a good everyman for the audience to experience this world through, though one thinks he could've done a lot more with the role, perhaps making him a tad more Sam Lowry from 'Brazil'. Next we meet a fellow who has inspired a large amount of (unwarranted) controversy, Mos Def as Ford Prefect... why is he a controversial choice do you ask? Well, he's a black rapper, but no he doesn't supply a Will Smith-esquire end credits song, and he doesn't start adding in jive-talking wisecracks, this is because Mos Def is a very good actor and his Ford Prefect is a very alien and very fun performance, he embraces (but not to a Rockwellian degree) his otherworldly self. These moments at the beginning provide some of the more quaint and effective character driven scenes, the flashback to Arthur and Ford meeting is lovely and the introduction of Trisha/Trilian is wonderful, Freeman displays all the charm that we expect from his flirtations with Lucy Davis in 'The Office', and Zooey Deschanel as Trillian is wide-eyed and very sweet, though she gets lost a bit in the machinations of the film's latter half. Everyone is then upstaged by Sam Rockwell as (spelling?) Zaphod Beeblebrox, he looks like Krull and acts like Jon Bon Jovi if Jon Bon were a spoilt eight year child who became immensely powerful... his performance is the most confident and audience-friendly of the entire film, and is also bloody hilarious.Right, well, that's the main cast, I shall briefly go over the special effects and such like... The production design is very bright and colourful, which I found both pleasing and disconcerting, sometimes it felt a bit too cheesy, but I guess that's the 'Heart Of Gold's fault for being such a happy, pleasant, OTT place (sighing doors and craving machines)... the most effective sequence, design wise, is Slartisbartfast (A Bill Nighy-style performance by, er, Bill Nighy) and the planet building factory; this sequence is one of the few that provides the emotional punch and heart of the film, as we zip over Earth Mark II you do feel very moved. The major threat of the film are the Vogon's, who are wonderfully created by Jim Henson's muppet company, and though I love the design there's something about the execution that didn't quite make them hilariously bureaucratic enough for me; but their big square, clunky world is well made and the literal slapstick sequence is a comedy highlight for the childish (Me). However, Anna Chancellor as the Vogon spokeslady person who fancies Zaphod seems very out of place.Roight, there's so much to say but I shall return now (a little less than 7 million years later) to that 'ultimate question'; why is the film's unusualness both a plus and minus? Well, it is a plus because the film can go off just about anywhere it likes and discards narrative structure with great carelessness in its pursuit to entertain you with lunacy and very British, very funny humour (a highlight of this being the Guide's entries and Bill Bailey's brief vocal performance as the Whale)... however, this abandonment of the basic structure also means at times the film doesn't seem to be doing anything or going anywhere, which becomes a little frustrating when you're not sure why anything is happening and what it will lead to, the filmmaker's have tried to remedy this by upping the emotion of the Arthur/Trillian/Zaphod love triangle, which I thought worked, but a romance (in this type of flick) isn't enough to keep me glued to my seat. Happily though, the film has enough visual verve and is held together by a superb set of performances and design work that you don't really notice.All in all, this film is a fantastic achievement that deserves to continue journeying in a number of sequels, let's just hope that the confused viewers don't steer the masses towards unimaginative, Vogon-like film-making, big, clunky, rubbish that usually fills the theatres this time of year (Van Helsing). This film is the sure to be gracing my top ten come the end of the year, and it has a wonderfully gleeful 80s blockbuster effects-comedy style to it (Think 'Ghostbusters', 'The Blues Brothers', 'Innerspace')",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
656,beefybooyawn,A Very Well Done Version Of The Story,10,13 May 2005,"I had two worries about this movie before it came out. One was, that it was going to be a horrible retelling and that I wouldn't get it since it was being based off of the original BBC series which I haven't come across yet. The second thing was that they would try to fit the whole story into one hour and a half movie. Neither happened, therefore it was a great experience.I've always felt that the book series was the perfect story to imagine everything and that someone's visual would be no good since it would be what they imagined and the only way I would appreciate a visual telling of the story would be for it to be my visual.This movie was done in such a way that my visual was played out without being played out. Basically, it didn't ruin what I envisioned of the story, rather, helped it.The best part about the movie is, it was told in a way that people that didn't read the book (or took in any other form of the story) could get, but there were still those things in it that only the readers of the book would get.And they didn't try to stuff all of the story into one movie. They make that apparent in the end of the movie, so I'm expecting a sequel.Other than that, the only spoiler I'll drop is, it's over way too soon. I could read the book series forever, and I could watch this movie forever. When the end credits rolled, I was disappointed because I wanted more. It's not that the movie didn't give enough, but that I loved it so much that I couldn't get enough.If you haven't seen it, enjoy it when you do. If you have seen it, I'm sure you enjoyed it. I can imagine that those that didn't like the movie were either expecting it to be like the book, which it was based off of the BBC series and NOT the book, or they have no idea what the story is all about and they were totally lost thru it all.My only advice is, if you're not sure if you'll like it or not, wait for the video release.

657,connorcrews,Excellent.,9,18 May 2005,"I read the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy last December and was extremely impressed with the book, and soon after (actually during) reading the book, I saw that they were doing a movie about it. I had high hopes since them, and I was not disappointed.Hitchhiker's portrays the book well, not extremely well, but well. It follows the major plot points and a few of the minor ones, except for that cheesy love triangle. That's enough bickering on what is the same, now on to what was good.It was extremely funny, with moments like the opening musical number with dolphins and ones where everyone is turned into yarn characters. Also moments like: ""We're going to die..."" ""Ya-wait, what is this? This is... this is... nothing. Yah, we're going to die."" The plot stayed mostly coherent but what would you expect from a Hitchhiker's movie? The visuals were mostly good (some of the Zaphod stuff was shaky), and the songs were extremely well done (So long and thinks for all the fish). It was well cast also, I could see all the characters in everyone.Now the bad. Some of the moments that were trying to be funny, just weren't. Some of Zaphod's visuals were shaky (also what was with his second head being under the first one?). And the love triangle thing was not necessary.The ugly. The Vogons.Overall, people with a high-and-mighty sense of humor won't think it's funny, but if you have that kind of humor, lighten up. And fans should like it, unless your the kind of person who goes all crazy if one line of dialog from the book wasn't in the movie.

658,wayne-172,Geek street or clown shoes?,7,17 May 2005,"*in best ""Guide"" voice*The interesting thing about H2G2 -- in fact only one of many interesting things about it, but the most pertinent to this post -- was the duality of its appeal. It was, on the one hand, a riotously irreverent comedy very much in-step with the ""pythonesque"" tone of its contemporaries. But it was also science-savvy, a fact that endeared it to the myriad of spotty nerds and emergent computer geeks lolling around the peripheries of their college societies.It was never going to be the case that this (or any other movie exploitation of the franchise) would succeed in maintaining the same duality of appeal, and that the ""college"" content would need to be ""toned down"", and the silliness ramped up and showcased in all its silly glory, in order to stand any chance of attracting a mainstream audience.As a result, the film has split opinion among old-school fans leaving some revelling in the shameless nonsense of the new blockbuster movie while the remainder mutter despondently about the dumbing-down of what they had always thought was the cleverest thing they had ever read, mostly because it made passing reference to areas of physics they had done particularly well in at school.So if you're an old fan of The Guide and one of those people who spent misplaced youths over-recording already whiny C-90s with the radio shows or hungrily reading, rereading and ever re-rereading the books, heed this warning: be honest with yourself about why you ever liked it in the first place because there's a 50-50 chance that everything you loved about H2G2 will be missing from the film.*beep-da-dadda-beep-da-duhhhhh*",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
659,jkemeyer,Worst Remake Ever!,2,29 April 2005,"I've been having mixed emotions ever since first hearing that there would be a remake of the classic BBC production of ""Hiker"" and I have to say that all my fears were confirmed this evening. Worst eight dollars I've ever spent.First the good, the special effects were outstanding, worlds better in every way to the cheesy low-budget of the original. The production values were top notch, the sound effects stupendous and it was visually stunning.But.. lines from the book/series that brought chuckles originally registered nary a humorous twinge. Some serious miscasting of actors, and apparent attempts to make this a 'serious' work of sci-fi instead of the parody-laden send up of all that reeks of space adventure simply didn't work any better than the reworking of the lines. After thirty minutes of straight forward following of the original brilliant storyline we were spun off into a series of increasingly more stupid new subplots and characters. The guide was barely featured and not much was explained. The entire movie suffered from the lack of narration unlike the series/book, adding to the confusion for anyone not familiar with the original work. The added romance nearly make me puke in my popcorn.

Fair enough I could see some point of criticism to the social standards and stuff like that, but the script made no sense to me.Anyway, I suppose that this is a movie to watch if you have already followed the books and the radio series.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
662,shavedham,Where's the punchline?,5,30 December 2005,"I have read all the books, practically memorising every joke, every neuance of the jokes and humour. When I went to see this movie, I was expecting a quality screenplay with the trademark wit of Douglas Adams. I was all excited because the man himself wrote the script, the main reason I was so looking forward to it!That was before I saw the movie.Half the time I was wondering where the damn punchlines were! They summerised each joke without actually telling the joke itself. I was disappointed with Mr Adams. To my relief I saw that the script was ""cowritten"" by Karey Kirkpatrick because to anyone who knows the original radio shows/books/miniseries and their writing style will be able to tell that Mr Adam's style is completely different to that of the movie. Hell I could do a better job by simply copying and pasting right from the books! Sure I know that each version of the Guide doesn't hold the exact same story from version to version, but come on! The movie didn't do a very good job of explaining things, glossing over the background of the story, infinite improbability drive, Zaphod's two ""heads"", deep thought, the list goes on. The only way I knew what was going on was because i'd read the books. It's safe to say, without a doubt, that Douglas Adams did NOT write the script as it is in it's current form.The only reason I am scoring it as high as I am is because of the visual design, which I thought genuinely good. The main problem with the movie was that there were too many redrafts, not enough Douglas Adams.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
663,mandcharles,Don't Panic,8,19 April 2005,"It is wonderfully refreshing to see an intelligent adaptation of a well-loved book which manages to be innovative and highly entertaining. I saw the film last week, and after having seen the television adaptation as a child I did not have my fond memories shattered. The eccentricity of the story and characters have remained intact, and the Monty Pythonesque humour has been enhanced with even more surreal flights of fancy. Although funded by the US, this is a very British film and those who are fans of the new Dr Who, League of Gentleman and Little Britain are well catered for here. The film will not appeal to everyone, but those who love the book and intelligent, original comedy will have a fantastic time.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
664,FourSpades,The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy,8,13 May 2005,"The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy was once described by someone I know as ""the world's greatest in-joke."" Which I agree with precisely. And here we have a film incarnation which operates on that exact principle - it is half built for the modern commercial American market and half for the longtime Hitchhiker loyalist, which is the seemingly unrecognised and surprisingly simple explanation as to why it has turned out this way. Perhaps once you view it from this angle you will see that it couldn't possibly be much different from its present form.In appealing to the Hitchhiker purist-geek who is looking for a frame-by-frame update of the BBC series or a literal transcribe of the peerless book, the film succeeds only to a degree. But that can easily be forgiven, for as any true Hitchhiker fan knows, ALL the incarnations of the series are predetermined to have key differences. Adams wanted the film version to be big, bold, brassy, fun, and with his trademark outrageous disregard for convention - and in that, it succeeds spectacularly.The much-mulled over and thorny subject of the cast turns out to be a non-issue - for they're all perfect. Or, if you'll indulge me, prefect. Mos Def, the most controversial choice, amply demonstrates that race mattered not in the world of Ford Prefect (the book says he has wiry ginger hair, and the TV series' David Dixon had curly brown hair - eat it, purists) as he turns in a lovely, super-cool performance as the laid-back hitchhiker. Sam Rockwell, in a fantastically enjoyable head-unscrewed turn, takes the galaxy's greatest egomaniac Zaphod Beeblebrox to his logical conclusion, with a contemporary ""thick president"" element thrown in; swaggers around, utters gibberish, and randomly faces anger attacks from his second head. Zooey Deschanel. I don't know what to say. That entire messy business with Sandra Dickinson and her American squeak is forgotten as Deschanel defines the enigmatic Tricia McMillan as the fascinatingly offbeat film sex siren she should be. She is indeed beautiful, witty, and mad as a balloon - not to mention beautiful... Martin Freeman just couldn't have been better as archetypal whinger Arthur Dent, melding his own everyman personality with Arthur's neuroses and general uselessness - occasionally borrowing a few mannerisms from his former overlord Ricky Gervais, which is no bad thing. Alan Rickman as Marvin is one of the finest, bringing the paranoid android's classic monotone lines to life ""I'm a personality prototype. You can tell, can't you?"" and kudos to the filmmakers for putting Warwick Davis in an amusingly lumbering robosuit rather than using CGI to bring him to life. The always excellent Stephen Fry steps into the shoes of Peter Jones with a flourish and delivers The Book's deadpan lines with his cuddly fervour. Bill Nighy is a perfect Slartibartfast, again taking the faintly twinkly quality of the book and TV series' grumbling scientist, and making it his own. The brief but memorable cameo by John Malkovich, especially written for him for the film by Adams, is interesting and amusing; Bill Bailey is a highlight of the whole thing as the voice of the Whale; and the League of Gentlemen are equally good fun as the voices of the Vogons.It's not a perfect production. I'm the first to admit that. Of course, I would have preferred, like many others, if some of the best jokes and lines hadn't been ridiculously condensed (cf. the witty bulldozer exchange at the beginning) or omitted altogether (Vroomfondel and Majikthise in the Deep Thought scene), but let's look at it another way. The source material, be it radio, television, or literary, because of its disparate structure and mishmash nature would be infuriatingly difficult to adapt to film by any standards. The book, certainly, displays a wonderful disregard for conventional structure as Adams frequently goes off on tangents as the book, only to return to the actual storyline such as it was a while later. This is surely part of what makes the book so brilliant - to use this same technique in film would be quite inconceivably bad. One of the most welcome additions to the film is the forming proper of the Arthur-Trillian love story, that Adams almost didn't seem to care about wrapping up in the literary incarnation - which was probably for the best - and here it works to a T.The fact remains that Garth Jennings chose not to make it dry in the spirit of the books, but extravagant, zany and fantasy-like in the spirit of its being an adventure film. The extra plot ideas bothered many, but I personally welcomed the new ideas (the Point of View gun, the crystal crabs subtly referencing the radio series, the idea-whacking things on Vogsphere). The special effects on offer were awesome, the Vogons look great and obviously far less cheap than the TV series; and the last half hour was pretty much perfect, as Slartibartfast's breathtaking tour of the factory floor, which choked me up as much as it did Arthur, finally manages to sum up the sheer brilliance of Douglas Adams in a visual spectacular.I'm not too sure what Adams would have had to say about the end result of this that he waited on so long, were he still with us today. But as the last 30 minutes blew me away, and I choked up yet again as I watched the ridiculously uplifting montage ending in time to the happily tragic ""So Long, and Thanks For All The Fish"" number, I felt a shudder of sheer happiness, and the voice of the man himself practically shouting through the abyss, reassuring me one last time, ""Don't Panic"". The song seemed a final, poignant tribute to the man from whom I have been given a lifelong stronghold on humanity, humility and appreciation of towels.A triumph for all that he didn't stand for - everything. :D",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
665,ejwfan-1,What would DA say about this movie?,1,29 April 2005,"What would DA say about this god awful abomination, the Disney's interpretation of the Hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy, if he could tell us what he thinks? I have no doubt that he'd be saying this! ""What have you YANKS done with my life's work!?!? How can you put MY name on this complete monstrosity?!? You have RUINED EVERYTHING!!!!!!!!!!!!!! How can you say that I made these changes!?!? Did I ever have Arthur Dent have a love affair with Trillian? Where did I ever have Arthur killing the two mice? You've turned him into some cheap Yank hero!!! And what is this Zaphod Beeblebrox announcing to everybody that he stole the Heart of Gold so he could go to planet Magrathea to find out the ultimate answer to life the universe and everything? I don't know which Disney executive enforced that idea but I certainly had nothing to do with it!!! The main thing that made my book funny in the first place is because it is filled with anti-heroes. All Arthur Dent wants is a nice cup of tea and maybe some biscuits to go along with it thank you very much! All Zaphod Beeblebrox is interested in is picking up some cute girl and showing off his brand new spaceship. All Ford Prefect wants is to go to a wild party and guzzle down as much pan galactic gurgle blasters as he can get his hands on until his brains suffer terminal meltdown. All Trillian wants is some peace and quiet and any semblance of normalcy. None of them are overly interested in becoming some kind of hero. The main reason for that is of course because that is just not FUNNY!!!! A bunch of anti-heroes traveling around the universe and ending up doing heroic things by mistake is funny. A bunch of motivated dudes running around doing heroic things because they want to do something heroic is NOT FUNNY!!! And what happened to all my jokes? They're all gone!!! You have chopped them all off and replaced them with cheap un-funny slap-stick material!!!!!! You've amputated all of them like some mad surgeon chopping off a patient's legs and arms when he's only suppose to do an appendectomy!!! ....."" and so on and on and on... Yup, he'd be in complete hell that is what he'd be in... Hmmm.. Which also proves that God doesn't exist! Just think, if DA were in heaven, and were looking down at earth and seeing all these god awful Yank barbarians chopping up and ruining his life's work, wouldn't he be in a complete hell? Even though he's supposed to be in ""heaven""??? To go further, suppose you were in heaven and someone you desperately love were to end up in hell. How would you feel about that? Wouldn't you be in complete hell knowing that someone you live is burning and suffering in hell? Which goes to prove that there is no such thing as heaven or hell. That there is no such thing as God to begin with. Oh, btw, DA was an atheist, didn't you know? And oh, now that I remember, they also chopped away anything that had anything to do with DA's atheist beliefs. For example, that Hitchhiker's guide entry about there being no God. Of course, such a thing would be inappropriate for viewing by the Yank audience.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
666,david-dumble,fans of the book should be disappointed,4,10 May 2005,"I know that this version of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy has some defenders who claim that people who don't like it wanted it to slavishly follow the book, but the deviation from the book is not my only complaint.1) They completely missed the tone of the book, something the BBC mini-series nailed. This is often a problem with films; they can mimic a book's plot, but often can't capture the narrative voice (that's why there hasn't been a great film version of Huck Finn; they can follow the plot, but they can't replicate Twain's narrative voice). The tone of the novel is frivolous, while the characters are completely serious; in the movie, the filmmakers are serious about making a movie, but the characters are being silly. An example of this is the cameo of Simon Jones (who starred in the BBC version) who plays a holographic salesman; there are quick cuts of him making funny faces, which the character wouldn't do if he were serious but the film makers must have thought was hilarious.2) The deviations from the novel's plot and characters don't enhance anything and undermine the work's theme. In the book, it is obvious that Zaphod Beeblebrox had two heads and three arms; it defined his character as a little odd. The BBC miniseries attempts to capture this were pretty pathetic given the technology at the time, but you'd think by now it would be possible. But no, Zaphod's second ""head"" is actually in his neck (?) and is not visible most of the time, and his third arm only pops out twice. A bigger problem is the development of a romantic relationship between Tricia McMillan and Arthur Dent, when in the book he was smitten with her but she wasn't really interested in him. The whole point of the books is that the universe doesn't care about Arthur Dent, he just happens to be the person in the universe we happen to be following, so the romance is definitely a product of Hollywood (I've read it was Douglas Adams' idea; if so, it was not a good one).3) The casting is mixed, but mostly worse than the BBC version. Zooey Daschenel makes a better Trillian than in the BBC version, but Mos Def is simple not odd enough to be Ford Prefect. Sam Rockwell has Zaphod trying too hard to be wacky, when the actor in the BBC version just sat back and channeled goofy. Bill Nighy, a good actor, is also too normal and low key as Slartibartfast. The original Marvin the Paranoid Android (who makes a cameo) looked much sadder than the round-headed counterpart in this version (they took the line ""brain the size of a small planet"" too literally). The actor playing Arthur was suitably bland, but lacks Simon Jones' ability to express frustration at the universe not quite making sense. Stephen Fry is perfectly cast as The Voice of the Book.4) Incredibly, the special effects were better in the BBC version. Okay, I suppose not really, but the graphic depiction of the Book was better realized, and they had to hand animate the Book's display. With modern computers the Book should have looked great, but the displays were a major disappointment.My advice to the film makers: Nice try, guys; the secret is to keep banging those rocks together.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

Now this film may not be liked by die-hard fans of the novels, because it is rather short. That and I heard people saying they changed a lot of stuff. Well, I never read the books so I don't care. This movie is freaking' funny, from the opening scene with dolphins singing ""So Long and Thanks for all the Fish"" to Marvin the Depressed robot shooting the Volgons with the Point of View gun. Every little thing in this movie was well done. The acting was beautifully done, the sets were very cool, and although this may not be a front runner for a ""Best Picture"" Oscar this will get the Oscar for FX because the gigantic factory floor where they built all the planets was simply breathtaking.Now I will say that there were some parts where the movie was a little boring (or maybe I was just really annoyed with the person sitting in front of me) but that doesn't matter none. The president was wonderful and he was a allusion to bush. And some of the greatest bits of humor are when he is yelling ""MAGRATHEA!"" just very well done.But my favorite scene in this whole movie is when the sperm whale is naming it self, and its about to hit the ground and he says ""look at that, its round, round, ground, I'll call it ground, hello ground will you be my friend?"" and he hits the ground and you hear this loud thump and you see a mushroom cloud.

This film is silly at best, unfunny and boring at worst. The forced laughter that everyone seems to have experienced along with this film was quite unwelcomed. Especially since those people that were laughing have read/seen those jokes a dozen times before. Why were they laughing hysterically? Why did they stop using the Guide references? They were the best part of the film and were just dropped fairly early on. The robot was stupid and NEVER funny. Did it ever occur to Arthur to put on some real clothes and quit wandering through the galaxy in his bathrobe? Oh, I suppose that was just supposed to be ""ironicly amusing"". Yeah the whole film seems to be like that. Dolphins in space, worshipping boogers. It's all just a bunch of bunk that left my audience quite cold, except for the afore-mentioned gaggle of uber-geeks.

670,earbird,Very well constructed clever comedy.,8,2 May 2005,"THis movie was a very refreshing break from basically any other movie out there. I have never seen the '81 version and have never read the book so I was not sure of what to expect. I didn't even know that is was a comedy. The introduction scene set the par for what to expect. The dolphin montage was absolutely the greatest and most breathtaking dolphin sequence anywhere in film. Another factor that made this film stand out was the use of Unscripted dialogue. Again I have not read the book or anything, but this film had a satisfying and refreshing sense of unscripted dialogue that most movies should at least try to comprehend. What is unscripted dialogue you say? Well, it is where the actors or narrators or any other character in a production do not talk like they are reading a script line by line, but talk in a way that is actually more human. Just about actor in every movie ever made talks in a way that is so inhuman and robotic that is a sure giveaway that they are reading line by line from some manuscript buried somewhere. The actors acted human, the acted sporadic and made the whole atmosphere feel like every audience member was having a different experience. The cinematography was top-notch, the visual effects were stunning and having a huge cast of very imaginative and wacky characters didn't hurt either.

I give the movie a 3 to represent the small parts I enjoyed. Oh OK and extra half point for another part I just remembered. I was very upset by the destruction or omission of many of the great lines from the book. Disney should be banned from making movies. There are plenty of well written bad reviews out there. I like how the email ads I received for this contained imaginary reviews by imaginary film critics. This film was a certifiable train wreck that horribly disfigured some great characters.

673,susistuart,"Hollywood mostly hits, but really never gets the point",8,26 April 2005,"A quarter of a decade's worth of H2G2 fans have been waiting for a feature film about their beloved Arthur Dent's hitchhiking antics and finally, we have one. And it's pretty darn good. Naturally, nothing can stand up to the BBC radio series or the books--not especially once Hollywood gets ahold of it--but the new Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy remains basically true to its roots.I was pleasantly pleased with the cast and special effects. Henson's Creature Shop brings the Vogons to life in a way that CG would never be able to capture, reminding us why their movies from the 80's gave us so many heebie-jeebies. However, the CG involving Zaphod was a little clunky, despite only being on the screen for a very very short while. Where the special effects faltered, Sam Rockwell more than made up for it, having well-captured Zaphod's narcissistic, spastic attitude.My biggest complaint is that no-one can ever seem to get Trillian right. If you're familiar and fond of the radio series Trillian, you'll like Zooey much better than the BBC TV series incarnation, but she still just doesn't seem to be bright enough (but definitely pretty enough).All in all, the movie is enormous fun, but the oh-so-bleak humor that we all love Adams for is mysteriously gone. Hollywood has taken away the dry gloom that makes H2G2 so much fun and replaced it with far too much sunshiny happiness, tying up all the loose ends with big bright bows that really were never meant to be tied up at all. There's a reason why the Guide is emblazoned with the words DON'T PANIC--because nothing ever really seems to go truly right for the characters.

In either case, I know it was awesome.First of all, the acing was superior and I couldn't find a fault line anywhere. Martin Freemen and Mos Def really showed their skills.Secondly, this is really the first time directors chance to make it big. His directing was spectacular, and for a first timer, I think it's better than Quentin Tarantino's work on 'Resevoir Dogs.' The Special Effects. Oh! The Special Effects. These were the best special effects I've seen in a film in quite the while. When Arthur put his hand over his mouth displaying how gorgeous the scenery around him was, I did the same. Mouth dropping.In conclusion, I have to that this is my favorite movie of this year, and most likely the most enjoyable and laughable film... ever. It is, by far, the best movie I have ever seen.

Douglas Adams' fabulous introduction is gone, as is most of the byplay between Arthur and Prosser. Almost like they took the attitude of ""Earth is boring, let's move on, and never look back."" When they move on they still don't use most of Adams' carefully constructed jokes and that's the disappointment here. The plot is and always has been insignificant the same way it was in ""Airplane."" It's merely an excuse to hang jokes from -- except here, they don't hang most of them.

It's apparent the actors in the film were not just reading the same lines but (there's no better word) *imitating* the actors from the original.

679,ozshooter69,"Better than I expected, still missing something",8,1 May 2005,"I can honestly say this is one movie which I have been waiting to see since 1982, when a friend of me let me read the first few pages of is copy of the book. For years I read and reread the titles in the series, watched the old TV show, and listened to audio versions, wondering when someone would make a movie, hoping, with obvious trepidation, that it would live up to the wait. And now...Well, it is better than a couple of reviews I read led me to believe it might be, but it isn't as good as I could have hoped for.What is there to be commended. Some great special effects, a vast improvement over the cheesy 1980s effects which marked the wonderful BBC TV series. Creatures like the Vogons are as hideous as they should be, the spaceship Heart of Gold is a marvellous concept, etc. The film just flat out looks great, almost has a realist look to it.The book sequences, such an integral part of the story, are well-done, although, and maybe this is just me, it didn't seem like there were enough of them to capture the flavor of the original. Stephen Fry was a good choice for the voice of the book.The acting is, by-and-large, pleasurable. Martin Freeman is a good Arthur, more real, less of a stereotype than the always-funny Simon Jones of the TV series. I wondered about the wisdom of Mos Def for Ford, but I'm sold now. Nice choice. Personally, I liked Zooey Deschaniel's Trillian just fine. Closer to the book's in appearance and action than the girl from the TV series. Sam Rockwell's Zaphod, um, well you either love him or loathe him. He plays an over the top character even more over the top. Sometimes it works, other time's not. I liked the different take on the second head than the awkward choice of the TV series, but I can't say I was sorry to see it surgically removed either. It needed to go.For fans, there are several cameos of people and things from past incarnations of the story which are worth keeping an eye out for: the original Marvin from the TV series in a line of creatures on Vogsphere, Simon Jones, the original Arthur, makes a brief appearance. The original theme music comes up at least once, and (according to the credits) there is a planet in the shape of Douglas Adams head somewhere in the film. A reason to watch it again.I guess what I missed most, and, for me at least, in many ways what made the books, the radio show, etc. so enjoyable -- and what's really missing from the movie -- is a lot of the witty dialogue. Whole sections that can still make me laugh are missing from the film, replaced by single sentences, or skipped entirely. Douglas Adams had the ability to turn a phrase one its head and make you laugh. ""The ships hung in the sky in much the same way that bricks don't,"" he writes of the Vogon constructor fleet. The movie gets in just a few words of the Guide's comments about the size of space. The movie is funny, but leaving out some of the funnier lines from the original was very disappointing, for this fan at least.That being said, I can say that, as the screen went dark and the words ""For Douglas"" came up, I teared up a little.

681,attiladomos,Incredibly clever...,10,17 January 2007,"If you're a fan of Monty Python, you'll get this flick, if you're not... you won't. It's pretty much that simple. It's a very intelligent comedy with awesome special effects and hilarious acting. What more do you want from a movie? It's almost as if Cleese, Palin, Idle and the gang wrote the script. It's full of imagination and will take you on a wild ride. In a weird way it sort of reminds me of ""Time Bandits"" a bit. Just the way that they're always popping in and out of worlds (as opposed to time). As I said before... it's clever, smart, full of imagination. I don't often hope for sequels to good movies, but in this case, I think the sky's the limit. I want a sequel!!!!",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
682,Drachenfuer,"Good, but not great",7,9 May 2005,"I went into this movie trying not to expect anything so I would not be disappointed. I, like others, was vastly afraid of what the mess this movie could be made into. I was pleasantly surprised. Overall the visuals, acting, and the humor far surpassed my expectations. The humor is grade-A Douglas Adams. They did not ""dumb it down"" nor try to genrefy Mos Def at all.As much I like and respect Mos Def's acting abilities, I feel he was miscast in the role for one small reason. He has a tendency to drop constants in some words, making it unclear what he said exactly. In a movie where a lot of the humor is way over some people's heads, this detracted from the movie majorly. Coupled with poor sound editing, some jokes were missed entirely. Sam Rockwell was also miscast. He got the idea of the character, mainly by coting as he does in all his movies, but totally missed out the subtlety of the character that a more experienced actor would have had. Trillian was acted fine but the entire movie was stolen by Allan Rickman's voice as Marvin and Warwick Davis moving the robot. They had just the right subtlety and hilariousness required for the role.In the whole, the plot was good, however I felt it was unfinished. I believe they should have worked more with the script Douglas Adams had started with. I think they felt they should not play with it too much or risk turning into something he would not have wanted. It was funny and basically complete, however they obviously left a lot out and left themselves wide open for a sequel. I am afraid they left a bit too much out. The movie does not stay true to the books as Adams did not want it to. The books were never the all-seeing source for the continuation of the series, the story and characters themselves having changed from he radio to the TV then the movie series.The impression I got was that of they did not try too much to mess with a masterpiece in the making. They should have messed a bit more. Even die hard fans will like this movie. It is warm and funny and decently done. Its just not a ""wowser"". Go see it. Hopefully they will make a sequel and really work hard on it and then that one will be the one that you say, ""Wow that was great!""",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
683,IceFreak2000,An appalling travesty,4,1 November 2005,"**** Contains possible spoilers **** I finally got around to watching The Hitchhikers Guide To The Galaxy last night, and I can't even begin to convey my sense of disappointment with the entire film. This really is a mess, and adds a nasty blemish to the H2G2 series.Let me first point out that I've been a huge fan of the Hitchhikers series, stemming all the way back to the original BBC Radio 4 broadcasts, through the hysterical books (stopping off for a quick detour through the TV series), back through the new books and the Dirk Maggs adapted radio series.And now this. Oh dear.First, the good points. Martin Freeman is an excellent Arthur Dent, and had he been given a script worthy of the character I get the feeling he would have been as good as Simon Jones' original. Stephen Fry is inspired casting as the voice of the book, and the animations for the book entries are sublime.Bill Nighy makes a very reasonable Slartibartfast, but the normally wonderful Alan Rickman turns in a decidedly mediocre performance as Marvin.And then it turns all brown coloured...The film moves at such a pace that at no time are situations or characters allowed to develop into Douglas Adams' lunatic sense of absurdity. For example in the space of five minutes flat (or what feels like it), Ford and Arthur hitch a lift on the Vogon Constructor Fleet, Arthur gets his Babel Fish, the Vogon captain reads poetry to them and they get thrown off the ship. And that's the general feel of the film - stuff just happens, and there's no explanation as to why or how.The other thing that will annoy long time fans is the huge volume of comic sequences that have just been inexplicably dropped or truncated to the point that all the humour has been surgically removed. An example occurs at the very beginning of the film where Arthur berates Mr. Prosser about the availability of the plans for the proposed bypass which will result in the demolition of his house. Whereas in the radio series, book, computer game etc. this segues into a hysterically absurdist description of the location of the plans the film stops with ""...in the cellar"" completely avoiding the joke and messing up the comic setup for the parallel with the Vogons and plans filed at Alpha Centuri.Avoid.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
684,DrDog,"A travesty. A disgrace, All our worst nightmares come true",1,30 April 2005,"I hate it. I hate everything about it. I want to chase everyone involved down the street with a sharp instrument.It is indescribably awful. It's all our worst nightmares about what Hollywood might do to it come horribly true.Every single person in it is individually, toweringly awful. Every single character is horribly miscast. It's as if it were cast by someone who wasn't even familiar with the characters at all.I was actually looking forward to some change, so I'm not complaining that they didn't ""follow the book"". But the new stuff was unfunny and pointless and simply made things harder to follow. You can tell the bits that Douglas did, though, and there are a few nice moments when you recognize his writing. But they number about two.There is no character development whatsoever. I tried to give what's-his-stupid-name a fair chance, but after introducing all the characters, they simply do nothing with them, unless you count the absolutely ridiculous romance subplot involving Arthur and Trillian. He didn't have a chance to show us if a black Ford really worked or not. (But no, it didn't. At all.) They Americanize all the characters except Marvin and Arthur and completely destroy the charm in the process.It's disconnected and jumpy; jokes and punch lines are inter-cut with unfamiliar and sometimes nonsensical context. It's as if they expect us to laugh at the punchlines alone, because we're so familiar with them. I don't see how someone coming on the movie with no previous knowledge of HHG could possibly enjoy it at all.The theater was half-filled tonight when I saw it, and what little laughter there was was during narration from the original book.Individually awful things about it: Zaphod, who they totally and utterly ruined; the ridiculously out of place love affair between Arthur and Trillian; Marvin, who they took about 3 minutes to design; the obviously-made-by-the-Muppet-shop Vogons... it goes on and on. It's bloody awful.This is just what I was afraid of. Come to www.hitchhikersucks.com and discuss how really, terribly awful this movie is.P.S. One thing to note in the scene where they're standing in a Vogon queue, the ""Your Plastic Pal"" robot from the HHG TV show is in the line with them. Nice touch, one of the only ones in the movie.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
685,schtaad,Questular Rontok?,10,1 May 2005,"Would someone please explain the character of Questular Rontok? I found her character completely underdeveloped. She was quite useless to the story as seen in the movie. At first I thought she was a political assistant to Zaphod Beeblebrox. Then later by the way she was acting, I assumed she was a forgotten ex-girlfriend of his. In the last scene when they were leaving, Beeblebrox seemed to get pretty cozy with her confusing me even further. Absolutely none of the characters responded to any of her actions of being a traitor. Also why was she not ""depressed"" when she was clearly standing with the Vogons when Marvin shot the gun? HUGE plot hole in an otherwise flawless movie. Thank you!",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
686,gavinleigh9,"Errrmmm I guess I liked it, it was nice.",8,8 May 2005,"I've seen the TV show, listened to the Radio Series, Read the Books ( several times ) and seen the Movie. So why do I never get tired of H2G2 ? Okay I wanted the movie longer and with more of the guide's input... but I still enjoyed it. I even enjoyed the half hearted love story. Was Arthur really the only man to ever understand Trillion because he knew she was dressed as Darwin ?. But Zooey was captivating, even as Darwin.... and here in the Midwest I doubt anyone would have known it was him either... Beagle or not. The two heads thing didn't cut it for me, and I'm not sure why they chose that idea... but Marvin was good... the ship was nice... in fact the movie was nice. It was nice in the same way that the girl down the road is. You know the one your mother always thought you should date, but who you never really quite fancied. At least there were in jokes for the Hikerphiles.... and I think I even heard someone say Belgium. I'm glad it was made... do I think the ""RatEotU"" will come next... I kinda doubt it. Which is a shame. Douglas we miss you.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
687,kevinharper26033,"This movie brings the word ""Bad"" to an entirely new level.",1,30 April 2005,"To be honest, it's hard to know where to begin...Let's begin at the end. As the lights came up in the theater my friend and I looked at each other with similar grimaces upon our faces.It was then that I began to apologize profusely.You see, I had convinced my friend to come with me to see this movie... something I now regret. Luckily we are still friends, but he swears he'll never trust my recommendations for a movie again.The movie was childish and immature. It was as if a group of seventh graders had gotten together and done a film project. Poorly.The special effects weren't all that special. From the trailer I was really expecting more and got way less.The additions to the plot of the book (i.e. The part with John Malkovich, the side-trip to Deep Thought, the kidnapping of Trillian and the trip to Vogsphere) were ridiculous.My friend, who has never read any of the books, was completely lost on the subject of towels, Zaphod's bizarre appearance, and many other items that were not clearly explained.To put it in a nutshell: If you were to compare this movie to a bit of Vogon poetry, the Vogon poetry would win hands down every time.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
688,einsijo,A decent adaption of the concept.,9,4 May 2005,"I Can easily state that this is the only movie I have been absolutely obsessing over since Jurassic Park (I was nine at the time and had a fascination with dinosaurs. I'm not proud of it). Having read all of the books, listened to the radio shows (the old ones) and played the game I could expect that this movie wouldn't faithfully represent the definite source material, because there in no definite source material, something many so called fans have yet to realize. Regrettably, most ""fans"" have only read the book and may consider it the only true source, ignoring the fact that the book itself is an adaption of the popular radio play from the 80's, and differed immensely from it. The fact is that with every new incarnation (Radio shows, Books, TV shows, Plays, Text-based video game and movie) Douglas re-wrote the story entirely, dropping some ideas, expanding others and adding new ones. This Movie is no different. There are some things I would have liked to see that were dropped, just like there were things in the radio shows I would have liked to see in the books, but there are also several new things I liked, the POV-Gun being a good example.OK. On to the actual review. I liked the actors. Freeman gives us a good view of the everyman Dent without getting overly exaggerated, Mos Def gives a whole new spin on Ford, portraying him as more of a hip person than the other versions (not really a bad thing though), Sam Rockwell gives an excellent portrayal of the egoistical half wit (literally!) President of the Galaxy: Zaphod Beebelbrox, though he might have been a wee bit more intelligent, Marvin is just like he's supposed to be like: depressed but funny. The character I liked most though was Trillian. In the other versions she was usually the least explored, being written out half way of the radio show and mostly seen as a secondary character in the books, she becomes much more important to the story in the movie, an importance which Zooey Deschanel manages to show in her portrayal. As for the other characters, I felt that most of them were satisfactorily portrayed, especially Humma Kavula, a new character played by John Malcowitch. the only criticism on him is that we don't get to see to much of him. The only character I didn't really like was Questular Rontoc: Whose only apparent role was to serve as an obscure love/hate interest to Zaphod, as well as being a device to express the humorous annoyance at Vogon bureaucracy. As for the rest of the film: Visually it's great. The good use of puppets instead of crazy cgi-ed critters contributes to the zaniness of the movie and the book-entries, one of the things that shouldn't be dropped, Are brilliantly animated. Though I never really pay much attention to music in movies, I liked the intro song ""thanks for all the fish"" and the orchestration of the original theme of the radio show gave me chills. The story was good, mostly staying with the main theme of previous versions while adding new fresh twists, but the pace of the movie might have been a bit excessive. One wonders how the movie might have been if it was about 30 minutes longer. All the more reason to get the DVD when it comes out, I guess.All in all its a great film, although I guess a non-HHGG veteran would enjoy it better since he wouldn't be familiar with many of the jokes. Besides that there is a lot of new stuff for fans like me, who have learned the previous versions by heart, to enjoy so whether you are a hardcore fan or a casual movie-goer, give this one a look-see.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
689,SirGilbertUnderwood,Awful,1,3 May 2005,"I feel (after waiting 20 years) that this is a huge disappointment.This film is for people who couldn't be bothered to read the radio scripts or the books. It is 'thin' and an extremely poor attempt to create a new story from an existing one. I grew up with this wonderful creation, but all this achieved was to make me very angry. The original was filled with subtlety and intelligent humour, this has neither. I am frankly appalled. DNA wrote and rewrote his ideas, I would hope that what we have here is the first draft and that if the great man had lived, he would have rewritten this another 1000 times at least. Either that or his script was destroyed by Disney and their flunkies.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
690,mindspin311,Mostly Harmless,6,23 July 2005,"As a longtime fan of the Hitchhiker Guide book series, I was very excited that they were finally making a big-budget treatment of the original classic. After seeing it on opening day, I thought the movie was well-cast, well-acted and well-produced. The visual effects were great (and I even like how they reinterpreted Zaphod's two-headed aspect using minimal, yet non-cheesy looking effects). And Zooey Deschanel is hot.But as the movie came to a close, it became achingly clear that there is no possible way a normal two-hour movie could really do the book justice, despite all the great things about it. Even though it has been years since I last read the book, I realized as I was watching this movie that so many things that made the book great were edited out of the movie. This movie was hacked to pieces! If everything had been included in this movie, it would have doubled or tripled the run-time, which would just not have been commercial and therefore would have made this movie's release inconceivable.I left the theater wishing that I had recently re-read the book to fill in the many blanks I felt from watching this movie. So when it becomes available on DVD, I'll re-read the book immediately before renting it for one final viewing. And hopefully the deleted scenes will fill in a few more gaps.If you're reading this and haven't yet read the book, my suggestion is to read the book in conjunction with watching the movie, just to see how other imaginations have interpreted parts of the book. I am sad to report that this movie simply doesn't (and can't) stand on it's own.42",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
691,mark-bridgeman,"A fine adaptation, but not brilliant.",7,15 May 2005,"I was worried, I'll admit that much. I'd quite enjoyed the books; the television series had delighted me (although on a recent viewing, I came to realise it wasn't as brilliant as I remembered it being); I just knew that Hollywood would screw this one up.Well... they did, and they didn't.MetaCritic.com has the film at around 6.8 out of 10. I think that's fair (although slightly lower than I'd give it). The film is a very fine film - it's entertaining, and the cast are (for the most part) very good in their roles.However, if you're familiar with the story already then you may find the severe truncating of the story (I mean, come on, it spans FOUR BOOKS! They can't put ALL of it in!) somewhat off-putting, but the STORY is still there - and it's fine!",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
692,srramos,amazing in a bad way,1,29 September 2005,"To put this simply, this movie amazed me. I had not thought that it is possible to make a movie this bad based on a book so good. If I was Douglas Adams I would sue, not only for the quality, but also for the claim that he had helped written that screenplay. It was mearly very loosely based on his work, and it quotes him quite a few times. It is also obvious which parts are based on his work just by determining whether or not it is funny. Also, it is obvious that the writer had not read any other books in the Hitch Hikers Series especially considering how many times they have something like the restaurant at the end of the universe is at the other end of the universe. Also, he did things such as trying to strengthen the plot (the book's is week due to the fact that it is based on the first half dozen episodes of a radio show), left out jokes that he referenced, and replaced funny events with predictable, unfunny events which in some cases are very similar. What I am trying to tell you here is do not watch the movie. Read the book.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
693,Ex-PFC_Wintergreen,Top movie. More fun than SOTD: might contain hints of spoiler,9,1 May 2005,"Oh, the joy, the joy!I never laughed with such childish glee at anything more than the dolphins opening song 'So long and thanks for all the fish' inspired lunacy. It was a real feel good number despite indicating the impending destruction of Earth (in the film, people) and I really felt the geeky pleasure surge in me when the familiar strains of the theme tune played in thunderous, glorious Dolby Digital. Oh, how I laughed. Then I stopped. Where was the story going? What happened there? Trillian doesn't get kidnapped? I'd not read ALL the books yet, but I'd listened to the whole radio play (which was the first incarnation BTW) and the whole TV show (it kinda sucked a bit) yet I was not too sure if I should be dismayed. A lot of the best jokes had been left out, and I was disappointed. Then ending was COMPLETELY CHANGED (I won't spoil anything, but it is completely different to the books in the largest of respects) but then I found myself reasoning like this: The books differed from the radio show. The TV show differed from the books. They were all nice new 're-tellings' of the story. Why on earth shouldn't the film have it's own identity too? I enjoyed the film once more, and let me tell you - I never enjoyed myself this much at a film since Shaun of the Dead. Oh, rapture. If you haven't seen it, WHAT ARE YOU DOING? GO SEE IT YOU FOOL! Marvin the PAranoid Android (voiced my Alan Rickman in splendidly dejected glory) is cute, nauseating and ultimately heroic in one of the most hilarious climaxes I've seen in a movie since the 'Beat up a zombie to the tune of Queen with pool cues' climax of SOTD. Martin Freeman is a fantastic Arthur Dent, exuding a lot of those dealing-with-aplomb-the-bizarre-and-awkwardness of his Tim persona in The Office. Sam Rockwell is a frighteningly charismatic Zaphod Beeblebrox (though the SFX guys quickly got rid of his second head and third arm - lazy gits) While Mos Def plays the complacency and confidence of Ford Prefect with bored ease (not the best actor to play him, especially when he announces to Dent in his American accent - 'what if I told you that I wasn't from Guildford after all?' well it could be believed!! haha.). But along with Marvin, manically depressed he is, and so lovable with it; it was hard for the fully packed crowd to utter words of 'aaahhh...' for him; Zooey Deschanel is a fantastic Trillian - sexy, sassy and the freshest talent seen for a long time in my opinion. I must admit she looked pretty darn cute in women's boxers, a shirt and knee length socks in a later scene... ohh.Sophie NEVER wants me to tell her THAT again. haha.Look out for Bill Nighy as the creepy and bizarre Slartibartfast ('I told you my name wasn't important').Fans of the actual skits from the Guide may be disappointed somewhat, as the book (with it's new animations) appears very few times, despite the movie being named after it. But it is the books appearance to the sound of 'Journey of the Sorcerer' which really sends the hairs up on the back of your neck. If you like that sort of thing (I do.) It has, of course been condensed in favour of bum-friendly viewing durations, but suffers not from the short length, and is an immensely enjoyable and entertaining movie. DOUGLAS WOULD HAVE BEEN PROUD.FYI they changed the odds of rescue from being thrown out into deep space, which corresponds to a phone number, to make it an up to date London area code and number. Little factoid there for you. (The original number corresponded to an old late 1970's London phone number, which had far less digits. Henceforth, they actually raised the odds pretty sharply for the movie. Arhtur and Ford were very lucky indeed...)",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
694,wordburger65706,"Brilliant, if compared to Vogon poetry",6,2 May 2005,"Audiences of this film can be divided into two demographic groups: 1) Douglas Adams fans keen to see a big-budget adaptation of his sci-fi classic; 2) Unsuspecting cinema-goers wondering why a man in pyjamas is trying to stick a small yellow fish in his ear.The producers must have decided that fans would go and see the movie no matter what, so it was the second group that the film would need to appeal to. It didn't have to be a remake. This was a good decision because trying to recreate the earlier versions in a two-hour flick would have been impossible. They've thrown lots of money at this film version, and the results are visually fantastic. But there's a serious problem. It wasn't a big special effects budget that drew fans to the original series in the first place. Did the unconvincing anatomy of the BBC Beeblebrox deter any viewers? None at all. The success of Hitchhikers was due to its brilliant and original creator. If someone who had listened to the radio series sat blindfolded through the movie, they'd be disappointed overall I think. Unfair I know, because translating a quirky written work to the medium of film can't be easy. How do you fit it all in? But bear in mind that the BBC series ran for only 180 minutes, compared to the movie's 110, and you'll wonder if it was worth making a film at all.It's hard to avoid comparisons with the TV series, and there are enough almost-identical-but-not-quite-right scenes for you to start to feel let down. The bulldozer stand-off seems all wrong without the original Ford and Arthur. Martin Freeman and Mos Def do a good job in the film but get a little lost in all the excitement. Also lost is the irony that the last surviving Earthman is a whining Pom in a bathrobe who's more worried about losing his house and morning cup of tea than about being hurtled homeless through space. There just isn't time for much dialogue at all. Extracts from the Hitchhiker's Guide itself are great but too scarce. On the other hand a not-so-funny party scene could have done with some editing. The deadly-serious Vogons are used quite heavily throughout the movie: great costumes and spaceships and bureaucracy. And they are all in at the Wallace & Gromit-style ending. Though this scene and many others are poor there are lots of brilliant moments elsewhere that make up for them: the dolphin musical number; the zoom-out from Earth to space; the great scene in the Vogon airlock (very cheaply done); ecstatic hankie worship with John Malkovich; planet Vogsphere; the short-lived but philosophical whale; and Slartibartfast's factory floor.First-time hitchhikers will probably be quite impressed by the movie, especially by its visual gloss. But I don't think they would be doing themselves or Douglas Adams justice if they didn't then go out and read his books. The movie, though fun in itself, is still no substitute. The clever humour just didn't have enough of a chance to come through.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
695,andy-1072,very sad,1,28 April 2005,"I saw this last night at a special preview. I am glad I didn't have to pay. I have been a fan of the books, the TV series and the radio series for years and was anxiously awaiting a big budget (I assume) version. If this is what happens when American movie money is pumped into a quintessentially British classic, then god help Red Dwarf.Martin Freeman's usually slightly abashed and unassuming character did not come across at all, and the huge event of the destruction of earth was reduced to a slight 'phew that was lucky' type approach and a ' wahey my ex girlfriend is on the spaceship, how lucky can I get'.The editing, sound quality and general look and feel of the movie did not reflect what we have come to expect from modern movies - the cutting between high budget special effects shots and some quarry in Kent were awful and cringe worthy.Bill Nighy looked suitably embarrassed by the whole thing, which although contained enough 'anorak' moments for true fans (the original Marvin the paranoid android turning up in an alien post office queue, Simon Jones, the original and best Arthur Dent having a cameo etc etc), seemed to lack from the cast's point of view enough belief in the whole project to take it from what came across as a really expensive sixth form school adaptation to what it should have been - a serious attempt at remaking a classic for the big screen.The only up side I can see is that more people will want to go out and buy the recently released BBC DVD of the series and watch it as it should have been done.

696,don-406,Just not funny- not in the slightest.,1,29 April 2005,"To put this movie in perspective- I walked out half way through. I've never walked out on a movie before- not even Battlefield Earth.That said- perhaps I should explain myself: Douglas Adams was a master at writing short and witty dialog- so the obvious thing to do in a movie adaptation is to throw it all out and replace it with... nothing. Scenes have been added and other scenes thrown out but in the end- the movie just is not funny. The seemingly random plot of the book is just plain senseless in the movie.Throughout the movie I just kept asking myself why certain scenes were changed and lines removed. If it made sense to advance a movie plot- fine. These changes though were just completely random.Instead of a hysterical scene in which Ford Prefect convinces a put-upon construction foreman to lie down in the mud in front of a bulldozer (because, logically, Arthur has to go to the pub with Ford and _somebody_ has to lie in front of the bulldozers) you have a scene in which Ford Prefect simply passes out cans of beer. Is this funnier? Does it make more sense? Does it advance the plot in some way... NO.Worse still- the scene in which the construction foreman explains to Arthur that the plans have been on display and he should have filed his grievance earlier.The version in the movie is:""I eventually had to go down to the cellar to find them.""""But you found the plans, didn't you?""The version in the book is:""I eventually had to go down to the cellar to find them.""""That's the Display Department.""""With a torch.""""The lights had probably gone.""""So had the stairs.""""But you found the plans, didn't you?""""Oh yes, they were 'on display' in the bottom of a locked filing cabinet stuck in a disused lavatory with a sign on the door saying 'Beware of the leopard.'""The movie version is 10 seconds shorter but about 10 million times less funny. Why? There are so many more things wrong with this movie I can't begin to list them all. I completely understand that Douglas Adams use to change the story with each new adaptation but they all had one thing in common- they were funny. This movie is simply awful.The only redeeming parts are Marvin (who although he looks stupid is at least sort of funny), the guide itself, and the yarn characters.Please do yourself the favor and do not bother to see it.

While I would hesitate giving any film a '10' for excellent, HHGG comes quite close - and was, actually, excellent for the genre. We laughed out loud countless times, occasionally openly guffawing, and held sustained giggles throughout. Smiling was nonstop. As for taking children under 8 or 10, there is nothing harmful in the film, per se (depending on your personal 'hover & shield' settings when it comes to your progeny), but most kids wouldn't get it - It'd go right over their heads and bore them to noisy tears.

698,PaulMcGlin,42?,1,2 May 2005,"*Spoilers*Perhaps I am speaking as a hard core fan, perhaps my love of the radio series and books are clouding my vision but I found this film to be nothing more then the excretion of money hungry Hollywood. They have clearly attempted to dumb down a work of philosophical satire into a family movie. At the beginning it seemed promising for a fan like myself, I found the joke concerning dolphins contained a new vigour when I saw actual dolphins preforming their famous tricks (or warnings). But as it slowly progressed I found it slowly becoming more and humiliating. Some of the best pieces of comedy from the radio series was underpinned with oddly zanny orchestrations which reminded me of a Tom and Jerry cartoon. The vogons were badly imagined and took such a large role in the movie that they simply did not have in neither the books or radio series, their main duty in the radio version was to blow up earth and act as a venting point for Douglas Adams hatred of bureaucracy. In the movie they served as the core villains, villains who are simply non-existent in the first series of hitchhikers guide. The worst part was the act of slapstick on vogsphere.Perhaps I'm speaking as a longtime fan but I was completely disappointed with Zaphods representation in this film, in an age of CG effects and computer grading you'd think that the director would have the courage to just give him an extra head, but sadly, no. Rather the extra head pops up embarrassingly on occasions and one would rather that if the director did'nt have the artistic strength to address the spare head that he would just scrap the idea altogether. They attempted to manipulate all us proud fans by placing in the well known theme, but it was so late into the movie it seemed more like an obligatory fact that the director would have avoided if it were possible. It also seems as though I am correct in assuming they know nothing of the books, as they head off to the restaurant at the end of the universe Marvin says ""Its at the other end""! The restaurant is not art the end geographically but in continuity, its there when the universe is destroyed! At the end they say ""for Douglas"", this seems to me to be an offensive act. This film gives the book a bad name and to address Douglas is like un-zipping and urinating on his grave. It completely misrepresents the book and a person whom was accompanying me said he would have left if I were'nt there! If you do go to see this movie please keep in mind that it in no way represents either the feeling or the sense of humor of the radio series, which I consider definitive. They did'nt want to make the hitchhikers guide, they wanted to steal its jokes and place them into their zanny concoction!If you are a fan you will go to see it, if only to shout about it afterwards.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
699,HughJanus007,Look out for these cameo's if you decide to watch this poor remake,3,4 May 2005,"I have read the books, played the on-line game and watched the old TV series. I was quite looking forward to seeing the movie but as I started to see the previews I began to realize that all they had done was make a very close copy of the old TV series, replacing the dated special effects with new ones.I decided to cross my fingers and watch the movie anyway, and not to my surprise, I wasn't impressed. I would recommend that you watch the old TV series on DVD instead. If you do decide to see this movie, rent it from BlockBuster or borrow it from a friend. Don't waste your money on it. Here are a few things that I noticed in the movie:1) Zaphod Beeblebrox appears to be imitating George Bush. 2) The robot from the TV series plays a cameo roll, lining up to submit some forms to the vogons. 3) The original Arthur Dent from the TV series plays a cameo roll when he appears as the holographic recording for messaging system for a planet. 4) Douglas Adams's face is displayed for about 1 second near the end of the movie when the ship heads for the restaurant at the end of the universe.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
700,therealficolley,"""Don't Panic"" ? I suggest ""Don't Bother""",1,3 May 2005,"I actually left this film really annoyed. Fabulous material turned into complete garbage. The casting is dire. Completely unconvincing and lacking in charisma. They might as well have dropped the character of Ford Prefect altogether for all the presence Mos Def brought to the screen and Zooey Deschanel completely fails to convince that she has a degree in maths and another in astrophysics. And what a waste of the vocal talents of the excellent Stephen Fry. The book hardly gets a mention and those were always the best bits. The only bits that brought a smile to my face is the cameo appearance of the original Marvin and the playing of the original theme music. I can only presume that this big screen version of a very British cult classic is aimed at an American audience that may not be all that familiar with the books (or the excellent low budget BBC TV version and radio series). I can't think of any other explanation for this hotch potch that bears very little relation to the original Hitchhiker's Guide. So save yourself a trip to the cinema. Read the fabulous, funny books. It is, after all, the only book in the galaxy to have the words ""Don't Panic"" in large friendly letters on the cover and is slightly cheaper than the Encyclopaedia Galactica.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
701,the_all_new_kelpie,Deeply disappointing,3,3 May 2005,"In spite of a high level of technical competence in the FX departments, which frankly the audience had every right to expect in this day and age, this movie suffers badly by comparison to any of the BBC series, either on radio or TV. The actors stroll through their parts on autopilot, speaking lines as if reading them from cue-cards and in general failing to add any depth to the original characters. Casting apparently done by flicking at random through the ""just about known to the Americans"" section of spotlight produced no surprises. Alan Rickman was a huge disappointment as Marvin who almost vanishes into the background in this adaptation. The direction is at best weak, lacking any creativity and suffering from an excess of what are clearly ""safety shots"", as well as substituting pathetic, ill-conceived and mistimed knockabout gags for wit. The script (which in spite of years of development, we must assume was in its early phases when Douglas passed away, since he was well known to rewrite to the very last minute) lacks any punch and manages to drop, obscure, or throw away every single favourite line from the original, often for no apparent reason. The sound is some of the worst I've heard in the cinema for a very long time...perhaps the string on the tin cans wasn't taut enough? Number one in the list of crimes is the edit, which gracelessly and without any apparent effort manages to knock every ounce of fun out of the whole sorry mish-mash. I don't think I've ever had such high expectations dashed so completely. May these people never make another film.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

Why would anyone replace some of the best British comedy next to Monty Python with fly-swatter slapstick. Gone is the subtlety. Gone is the social commentary. I know they gave Douglas Adams a writing credit but I believe he would be bitterly disappointed. I was. It was 2 hours of Vogon Poetry.

The book, for some reason, draws out a very devout fancrowd, despite the blandness.No, the movie wasn't really the book but it was made better for it. The movie used brilliant witty visual timing schemes for humor, something that the book failed to provide. While yes, the dialogue was a bit lacking, this was definitely the most enjoyable film I have seen in a long time.The comments made that people who had not read the book would be confused was utterly preposterous. I went with a friend who had not read it and she was not confused for one minute-- the movie was very clear about everything, even at the most random of moments. There was nothing ""confusing"" about the dolphin scene, the narrator clearly recites that the dolphins knew about the world coming to an end and thus left a final message.

A couple of clever moments failed to save what can only be described as a contender for the worst movie of the year. I'm a fan of Monty python, red-dwarf and the like, but come on.. The characters were uninspiring with the script reading like a highlighter had been used on the book to produce the thing and god, the opening song was an abomination. No less than 5 people walked out on this film; it should have been 6, but i was too stunned to move.

705,wfjgcinet,The wit was pared back a great deal,4,8 May 2005,"When Hitchikers originally came out (as a BBC radio series, long before the book was written) it was very successful for two reasons. First, the radio effects were great - really new and inventive for the time. Second, it was smothered in droll, dry, ironic British wit.I remember hanging on the cleverness. It had a similar feel to a TV series of the same era called Fawlty Tomers. Some of the phrases stick in my mind almost 30 years later: the bypass plans on public display were in a locked cabinet in a cellar under a sign Beware of Leopard. ""It's times like this I wish I had listened to what my mother told me - What did she say? - I don't know, I didn't listen."" Trillian took off to space because, as a woman with an advanced degree in physics, it was either try that or go back to the dole line.I understand how a radio play has to be drastically changed to provide a (somewhat) coherent movie plot. I understand how the six hours of radio had to be edited down to fit a movie.But there was an awful lot of very bright, hilarious, thoughtful wit that could have fit in. Unfortunately, it had to make way for the usual formula writing. It was a little disappointing for something so very original to be turned into something quite ordinary.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

You don't need to invent characters, change plot lines, etc. Just film the dang book! Lord of the Rings...successful because they filmed the dang book. Hitchhikers Guide, great until about 30 minutes in when the plot starts to diverge from the book and I start to get mad. Even if Doug Adams wrote the new stuff, then here is a message to authors tasked with writing screenplays for their own material: Just film your dang book. If you want to write new stuff, MAKE A DIFFERENT MOVIE. Yeesh.Started out very happy because they seemed to be honoring the spirit of the book, radio show, and TV series which were all genius, but with lousy production values. The plot then proceeds to bounce around everywhere, new (and unwelcome) emphasis is placed on some newly concocted romance between Arthur and Trillian, and a hundred other useless new things are inserted where a hundred old great things have been ripped out...kinda like having your Bree replaced with cheddar.I can't really comment on whether it was good on its own because obviously I am close to the source material. But this great chance to finally do justice to one of the greatest and most beloved works of fiction in the modern era has been squandered. Doug, if you helped in this process, I'm sorry you had so little confidence in your great original material.

I went to see this movie expecting them to have done something, anything, other than what they did -- make an exact duplicate with a bigger-name cast and better special effects. I find it sad that the original was low budget and better. Not only did the remake cut a bunch of things (like leaving out the fact that mere seconds before the world was destroyed someone finally found the question to the answer 42), they added pointless story threads with no intention to resolve them within this movie (like adding the gun but not showing what happened with it, good thing too or they'd have nothing to suck people in to see the sequel with). The acting was good, but no better than the original. Thank you Hollywood, for recycling the same things over and over and not coming up with anything original, as usual. Why don't you try making a movie based on a great book that hasn't already been done before?I'm giving this movie 2 more stars then I think it merited because the Thanks For All the Fish song was worth 2 stars all by itself.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

It was stupid rather than funny, lacked intelligence and wit, and it slid so fast through key plot areas where so much value could have been gained, and introduced material that added no value. There was no pace. It was a total mockery of a great piece of intelligent humor. In the book, Arthur Dent was a dazed bumbler, a mere step above a simian, but a pleasant one. In the movie he is made into a semi-willing hero who wins the girl. Get real! He never stood a chance. Zaphod Beeblebrox was pathetic - overacted and the gimmick head just does not work. Trillian lacked the sexy intelligence of the true Trish MacMillan of the book. All in all it was a real abortion of a movie...if you really like the books.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

The casting is what makes this film truly great. I couldn't believe that the makers had got Mos Def to play Ford Prefect. I thought that he would take this wonderful, comic character and make me hate him with a passion. After watching the film, in my eyes Mos Def is Ford Prefect! He plays the part with perfect comedic timing and never over acts.The rest of the casting is superb. A special mention has to go out to Stephen Fry who narrates the film.

All of the great one liners were removed, and for some reason, the film-makers had to explain Zaphod's reason for stealing the Heart of Gold. They even changed the story to make it look like the mice came from the fabled planet of Magrathea.

After a mere good start the plot goes from bad to worse. The animations of the book itself were much better even in the 1981 TV series (which has a lot of bad SE but is much more on the hook of the book than this new bullshit). there are so many lost opportunities e.g. right at the beginning where Ford gives the workers some beer to stop them destroying Arthur's house instead of convincing the head worker to lay down in the mud instead of Arthur. All the important things were not really explained (e.g. the need of a towel - they just say you need one but are quiet about the ""why"") Before seeing it I thought that it's impossible to shorten the plot to a 109 minutes and unfortunately I was right. too bad and too sad...

I was disappointed in the movie Dune after reading the book, but over time I learned to appreciate it as the visualization of somebody else's idea of the book. I don't believe that will happen here since a movie should at least be as good as the series if not the book. Since I bought the DVD, I suppose it can still be useful as a stocking stuffer for Christmas. It's better than some article of clothing to be gift wrapped.

If DNA believed in such nonsense he would be spinning in his grave.

Trillian and Slartibartfast were just OK.The Bad: Everything else.Arthur was cast well but scripted and characterised terribly. Woefully. And a number of other llys. Things happen TO Arthur. He does not drive the plot. The person who designed Mavin's head should lose theirs. Ford and Zaphod were terribly cast and scripted. In fact the whole script was terrible with almost every vestige of humour or wit removed. It struck me that neither the director nor whoever took over the script after DNA's demise had actually read any of the books. They might just have read a few pages of the script for ""Men In Black"" and not realised the difference. Why they felt the need to introduce new bits of unnecessary and unamusing plot and characters I have no idea.If you like or even love the books then the first 20 minutes won't make you cry. That is the job of the rest of the film.You expect changes when the film of the book is made.

722,ptjlmbaldwin,Ummm...did the filmmakers even read the book?,1,8 November 2005,"Here's the good: ""So Long and Thanks for All the Fish"" is a great musical number. Full of whimsy with just a touch of smart-aleck-ness. The Vogons, modeled after bureaucratic Middle-aged British folks is genius.Now the bad: everything else.The overriding problem with the movie is that it fundamentally misunderstands the character of Arthur Dent, who is THE central character. In the books, Arthur is basically a grown-up Charlie Brown. The misfit who never kicks the football, who never gets to talk to the little red-haired girl and who never wins the ball game. Arthur is the misfit on earth who becomes a greater misfit in the cold, lonely cosmos.I have read all five volumes of the Hitchhiker's trilogy and though it starts out great and ends up badly written, the character of Arthur Dent is consistent: the Universe IS out to get him.Here comes the spoiler to the movie (and to the books). Jump past the next paragraph if you don't want to know what happens.In the movie, they change the character of Arthur Dent. Radically. You have an empowered, boring Arthur Dent as opposed to an incompetent, interesting Arthur Dent. In the movie Arthur gets the girl, gets the earth back, gets the Heart of Gold spaceship, gets to correct every wrong choice he ever made, gets to speak eloquently and ends up the triumphant hero. In the five book trilogy, he gets no girl, no spaceship, no earth, has no eloquence, his problems get severely compounded and he ultimately dies. Thus ends the spoiler paragraph.The filmmakers (including the recently deceased Douglas Adams, who wrote the books) seem to misunderstand the tension between Arthur and everyone else. The movie, rather than exploring the delicious, neurotic fractures of Arthur's mind, instead goes for the wackiness of a Zapod Beeblebrox channeling Geo. W. Bush, a John Malkovic character manifesting general creepiness and everyone else muttering their lines as if they didn't understand how to properly deliver them. What could have been a brilliant picture becomes a disjointed mess. Even the final gag line of the film, spoken by Marvin the Paranoid Android, was totally blown by the writers.Folks, heed my advice. Read ""Hitchhikers"".Read ""Restaurant"". Read ""Life, Universe and Everything"". Then stop. Don't read the last two books. And don't watch this film.

The fan who knows the books and original BBC series, and was disappointed :( I haven't met someone who is a fan that really enjoyed the whole movie yet.Many friends have frowned at me as I didn't laugh as much and wasn't as amazed as they were about the movie.It's not because the movie was really awful (it could have been worse). But because those of us who have read the books and enjoyed the BBC series know how much better it could have been!It was all there for the taking, a better storyline, great one liners, ideas and concepts that were deeper and more entertaining that the new movie.I for one hope they make another, as there is so much material, and maybe from constructive feedback and effort on our part as fans, make it better - truer to Douglas Adams style. I wished the script writers had thought for just a moment that the viewing audience had more intelligence than they had assumed. Hitchhikers is funny because it parodies so much of our lives, thoughts and feelings. It takes cherished concepts and adds unique slants and views that make us smile and appreciate just how clever and stupid we as a species are!Instead they went more for eye candy, quick jokes and lots of slapstick!? It just wasn't necessary :( I enjoyed:* The familiar fanfare as the hitchhikers guide floated through space, it really made me smile.* The movie scored points for me on Graphical style, it was clean, detailed and nice to see it upgraded to the 21st century. * Dolphins scenes were good. * Was very pleased that the Sperm Whale and bowl of Petunias scene was kept in LOL* Million of Vogon ships surrounding the Earth, was nice to see :)* Zaphod wasn't too bad, but he was the ONLY character that stood out for me. Which is really sad for a movie with so many potential great characters.* Hitchhikers book graphics and narration. Steven Fry was excellent and the animations were very ... 'watchable'. ;)* Slartibartfast's and Arthur's ride through the vast hyperspace construction tract was great, looked wonderful! :laugh:I was really disappointed with:* Comedic timing. The actors seemed 'out' of rhythm. Delivery of lines were flat in many places, and so many explanations that would have made the movie 'shine' were just dropped!?* Marvin. Sigh, the old Marvin had great character and the voice was so much better, richer, with so many great lines and insights that were never used in the new movie!* Deep thought. Appeared very rushed and shallow, not 'deep' at all. The actors never really seemed to grasp what they were delivering?For me so many great scenes just weren't there? :(* Restaurant at the end of the Universe, even for a quick bite! *Disaster Area ( would have been better than the saving Trillian scenes) * ""Resistance is futile"" scene etc* The HUH factor! So many times I began to enjoy a scene and dialogue, then had the best part taken away, I was expecting the classic and wonderful lines we all cherish and that make the BBC film work so well ?EG:"" Ah, this is obviously some strange new usage of the word safe ...."" - ""It's times like this when I'm trapped in a Vogon airlock with a man from Betelguese ...."" - ""Harmless ..... Mostly Harmless"" - ""They hung in the air the same way that bricks don't."" etc * Overall the characters were not as solid.Arthur had a strong love interest, he became quickly infatuated and emotional. So much time was spent making the love story unfold as the expense of other characters. Arthur, the quirky, nervous character that looked so out of place, yet surviving, was not there for me :(Ford dropped into obscurity and never seemed play a bigger role than Zaphods friend. His cleverness, the twinkle in his eye, his knowledge never really showed.Trillian .... she just never hit the mark for me?! Her confidence and intelligence were replaced mainly by emotional outbursts and sarcasm?(Read Douglas Adams' books to find the characters the way they could have been presented)* In closing.Again so much more could have been done with the movie, ALL the material was there for the taking!One review said : ""....But it doesn't do justice to the open-ended inventiveness of the original. The inevitable Anglo-American accommodations of casting have muddled its identity and the performances of the new American stars can be uneasy.""For those that argue that the movie was fine.I can have an opinion and ask that you do yourself a favour and watch/read some of the original stuff to really appreciate what I am talking about, you may actually enjoy it too!I hope the movie does well, ONLY to usher in further, better works.I also hope it exposes MANY more people to the wonderful works of Douglas Adams.Much more can be said, but I have rambled for long enough . :)",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
727,paul-538,Don't Bother,3,3 May 2005,"I basically grew up with the books and the BBC TV miniseries, so this is a movie that I have long been waiting for. By the same token, I realized that this movie was made after Douglas Adams' death (resquiescat in pacem), and that it was a product of the Hollywood machine, so I went in knowing that it wasn't going to be a 100% faithful reproduction of the H2G2 story. Sometimes, this can be a good thing: ""Blade Runner"", for instance, was totally removed from the Phillip K. Dick story it was ""based"" on (""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?""), yet it was a completely brilliant work in its own right.That being said, I was really, really, really, really, really, really disappointed in this movie.The first 15 - 20 minutes of the movie pretty much followed the plot line of the original book; some essential scenes were rushed through, and a lot of the humor that was both in the book and the BBC series was watered down, but it had some original comedy bits, and the actors had reasonable performances.The rest of the movie, however, was not the Hitchhiker's Guide. I don't mean that they deviated in minor points -- I mean that the scenes, story, and plot line from that point on were not taken from the books written by Douglas Adams, period. Again, this was not in itself necessarily a bad thing: a little artistic license can be useful (or even necessary) in translating a book to a movie. What they put in its place, though, was a dumbed down, Americanized, fairy-tale-action-romance flick with slapstick humor that was, at best, mediocre.In short: the bastardized sewage that Hollywood stewed together here would have made a great movie on the Lifetime network -- but for anyone expecting a cerebral, sci-fi comedy in the style of (or even in same ballpark as) Douglas Adams, you're better off sticking with the books.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
728,tthuhta,Douglas's spirit is there,7,15 August 2005,"As a Hitchhiker fan, I was afraid of this movie. I thought they could spoil the story and make an unintended mockery of Adams's cult book for those who haven't read it. But no, they made an excellent movie about it. The clip is fast and funny, The philosophy and bizarre humor is there. For those who know the story, there is something new as well, like the romance between Tricia and Arthur , a new character and an extra stop to a planet. The appearance and behavior of the characters were not quite what I made up in my head (especially Zaphod's heads), but who could have imagined them better. The story is a bit more happy and optimistic than in the book. Now I'm afraid they make awful sequels to this excellent movie.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

I also am a huge Zoey Deschenal fan, so getting to look at her for 90 minutes isn't the worst thing in the world. And all the little inside jokes for the fans are great, seeing the Marvin from the TV series in the line at the Vogon home world, and all the little odes to Douglas throughout the movie are great.so if you think that since this isn't a direct translation of the book then its a shitty movie, get over it, if Adams wanted the movie to be a direct translation of the book he would have wrote it that way, the movies funny, and enjoyable, and thats all that matters.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
730,yoerih,infinite improbable,5,7 May 2008,"For a book I really like and have read the books in Dutch and English raised with me the expectation of a good movie. Throughout the books the characters are very well worked out and it is reading more or less like a spontaneous Monty Python in Space. In the movie sadly enough the characters are more caricatures of themselves and it's made like ""OK it's supposed to be a comedy, we play funny"". And it ended up like a bad acted series of quotes. Specially Marvin is to unrealistic. Of course you'll recognize the first book, the characters and the several hints to the other books. But it looks like watching a comic-book.Positive, the special effects are good, specially the destroying of earth and I like the way Zefrod got his second head, that's done very original.To conclude: if you've never read the book it should be an OK movie, after reading the book, forget the movie.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

The TV series was excellent as well and portrayed the character in a brilliant way. As for the film, I saw many disgusted looks from H2G2 fans as they saw the new small and round Marvin with a high voice (not that Alan Rickman didn't play it brilliantly). As for adding things to the story that weren't very entertaining or relevant, I just found them quite annoying. I think on the hole it was a good film...if you hadn't read the books, so I suggest that you watch this film before you read the book then the books will be even better. The thing that annoyed me most of all was that Ford Prefect was an American! I doesn't even fit in with the plot! Watch the film THEN read the books.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
732,Ferol,"Don't Panic - Actually, please do, very much so",1,17 July 2005,"Many people were panicking about the release of this movie, expecting it to be another waste of their time, and they were correct to worry.I have read the books several times and have listened to the audio books, read by Douglas Adams, many times.I hate the guys that have read the books, and say movies cant match up to the books, while this is not me.Look at Trainspotting and Jurassic Park, two movies that are great fun to watch as movies, even if you have read the books, they follow the same story and create a new way to look at that story.First off why all the Americans, you have to hate this, but Trillian, acting as an English person, why could she not just be an English actress? The same with the explosives guy in Oceans 11.This is a very English book, the humour is very English and to carry this off Englishness is needed, not some no name American actors and actresses, with one English guy as the star. OK, there are a few other English names in their, Fry, Griffiths and Bailey, but they were voices, not actors.That is problem number two, why not use Douglas Adams voice from the recordings for the narrator instead of Fry, Fry is someone I very much like, however he is not required here, Adams would have sufficed and also left some nostalgia within the movie.The reason that the books did so well was the dialogue of the characters, this is pretty much the makeup of the book, great lines delivered with sarcasm and ridiculous situations for the characters, there is no real story to follow, sure, a few things happen in order, but they are not the substance of the books, it is the narration and lines and how they are delivered that make it so great.I think that one of the reasons this movie is so bad is that they have tried to fit so much into such a small space of time, it is required now that movies fit into certain time slots, no more Once Upon a Time in America or Titanic movies allowed, they are too much, we the public demand to only be entertained for our $10 movie ticket for 1.5 to 2 hours, no more, we cant keep our concentration, we don't have the time, we want in, buy popcorn, watch movie, and out again, maybe with a fondle if we are lucky, anything more, and it wont be a hit.Also why are all the characters apart from the Vogons human, there is no need for this, they are aliens, OK, maybe other alien forms were not described in the books, but why care, the movie does not give a damn what the book is like anyway, so why make a nice human character for every alien race there is, even Zaphod does not appear as the book says, his and Arthur's first meeting talk about the two heads shown, at a fancy dress party. The only reason I can think of for this is to make things cheaper to film.I am very upset that what is a great book has been ripped into a short series of events depicted as a story without any of the meaning or wit that pulls the whole thing together. I wish that this was never made into a movie, it is one of the worst adoptions of a book I have even seen.What scares me is the way that the top 1000 voters of IMDb voted for this movie, and the rest of the votes, I do love the books, but I also love a good movie, and this without the comparison to the book, is not a good movie.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
733,kathryn230791,Outshined by a 70's TV series - How embarrassing!,1,27 December 2006,"I have read all the Hitchhiker's Guide books by Douglas Adams and when i heard that there was a film coming out i was really excited. The cast looked amazing and i believed that no one could butcher a book, which is such a classic. I was so VERY WRONG.To begin with I still fail to understand the preoccupation bordering on obsession that this film had with the wretched Vogans considering that they were at best a means to an end in the book! They appeared in must have been 5 pages at the beginning of the first book and 5 at the end of the last. They were dealt with in this 'movie' as a main feature, but still a boring one at that! In addition to this, i couldn't help but pity the obviously capable actors as they struggled to bring ANY depth into the poorly written script. The classic characters were ruined, with Zaphod and Trillian as the more obvious casualties.To properly enjoy this story i would strongly suggest that everyone skips this movie, reads the book, or even watches the 1970's TV series that (rather embarrassingly) outshines the film in every way.And oh yes, In case anyone's wondering, It's 'Marvin the Paranoid Android' NOT 'Marvin the depressed robot' I have a rather sharp pain in all the diodes down my left side.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
734,Bopvilla,Fantastisch,7,2 May 2005,"If faced by a group of hardcore Douglas Adamites, Michael Winner would probably say something along the lines of 'Calm down dear, it's only the big-screen adaptation of a well-loved book and pop-culture sensation'. In return they would politely tell Mr Winner where he could stick both his car insurance and film opinion whilst attempting to explain why The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is so much more; it's a culture, a way of life. Fans should fear not however because Adams' authentic voice - the spirit of his work - remains alive and his quirky space opera is in the safe hands of the music-video innovator and first-time director Garth Jennings. Sit back, relax and prepare yourself for this long-awaited big-screen transmogrification.This massively epic feature hurls the audience on a wonderfully improbable trip through a near infinity of physical changes with visits to other spaceships and planets. Arthur Dent (Martin Freeman aka Tim from The Office), the quintessentially reserved and rumpled Englishman, and Ford (played with graceful comic timing by hip-hop artist/actor Mos Def) learn that an interplanetary construction crew is about to demolish Earth in order to build a hyperspace expressway and then embark upon a trip on which they encounter a multitude of eccentric characters, including the daft, two-headed, three-armed president of the galaxy, Zaphod Beeblebrox (Sam Rockwell - suitably annoying and over the top); the eternally depressed robot Marvin (voiced by a hilariously misanthropic Alan Rickman); an extremely bizarre quasi-spiritual leader named Humma Kavula (a camp cameo by a miscast John Malkovich); and a planet construction engineer known as Slartibartfast (Bill Nighy  a gem once more in his minor but exquisite performance)Purists of the original book/series may be somewhat disappointed. It has been tweaked and adjusted, with a romance included here and a new character whacked down there - as if the screenplay itself had been put through the Infinite Improbability Drive - but the film remains scattershot and episodic in a manner similar to Adams' novels. These can only be minor quibbles and are not so radical that they felt un-Hitchhiker-y (a technical term I can assure you). In fact, it is its adherence to the original work that proves to be its finest feature whilst also being its greatest fault. Like in Adams' book there is no central, clearly defined plot but, instead, just a succession of tasks to set up the jokes. Clarity and purpose occasionally becomes obscured.The limitations in budget are undeniably obvious, but, instead of being a flaw, Jennings creatively blends the best of modern CGI with old school FX and Jim Henson's Creature Shop so that the low-tech imagery enhance the film's charming fairy-tale quality and creates a visual inventiveness that is admirable. The Vogon puppets (representing a race of grouchy alien bureaucrats) seem real, more so than any computer generated character (yes, LOTR fans, even Gollum) and watch out especially for an impressive backwards zoom out from the earth's surface. Overall an impressive achievement; funny, unique and visually sumptuous. It blasts from one topic to another at a machine-gun pace, maintaining its narrative by the very thinnest of threads while unleashing a hurricane of stream-of-consciousness observations. Think Monty Python but in space!Just be wary of any dolphins flying into outer space whilst singing, ""So long, and thanks for all the fish."" __________________",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
735,steynj,Don't Panic! (at all),9,7 June 2006,"The Hitch-Hikers Guide to the Galaxy is as enthralling as the book. A short summary of the movie would go something like: Arthur Dent is taken off the Earth just before it is blown up to make way for a space bypass. Sadly, his day has only just begun. Before it's over, he will have been blown up, heard he third worst poetry in the universe, been thrown out of a window, rescued, shot at, had a fish stuck in his ear, insulted, whacked, sickened, deprived of tea, learned the answer to the ultimate question, and almost had his brain sawed out by mice. And that's all in the morning. True, Arthur Dent isn't the adventurous kind of person, but when he is joined by his girlfriend, the Official President of the Galaxy, a paranoid robot and many more crazy characters, he begins to melt. At certain points the movie is so crazy; it is as if you are staring face to face with an alien! You never know what's going to happen next!The Hitch-Hikers Guide to the Galaxy gets an easy 9 out of 10 because of its large amount of humor, and its totally weird bits.

It felt like they sacrificed the funny bits in favour of trying to add more ""plot"" which wasn't terribly exciting either, sad to say. I grew up reading the books and listening to the radio show on tape during long car trips, so yes, I am a fan who has most of it committed to memory, BUT I was prepared to give them some leeway.

737,cameronmr-91566,A fully enjoyable film for a fan of the other works,8,22 January 2020,"A movie that answers questions that aren't plausible and leaves you skeptical of things you couldn't dream to even think of. If questioning the universe doesn't sound especially pleasing to you, don't worry, it shouldn't. But Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (2005) is a movie that has all the answers you need, for questions like: Who commissions the creation of planets? Are mice experimenting on humans? What is the bowl of petunias thinking? And what is the practicality of a towel in intergalactic travel? In other words, it's a sci-fi comedy based primarily on Douglas Adams' novels, which supplies an absurd perspective on ""life, the universe, and everything.""The journey to find answers, starts with Arthur Dent, an ordinary man, ""who no more knows his destiny, than a tea leaf knows the history of the East India Company."" He thinks it's the worst day of his life when a construction crew shows up to demolish his house for a bypass. Ironically enough, Ford Prefect, comes to tell him that the entire Earth is being destroyed for a bypass as well. With only a very helpful travel guide and some towels, Ford takes Arthur into space; this is where they're brought aboard a ship in search for the purpose of everything. The ship's only navigational system is improbability, so of course, only impossible things ensue...For a movie whose plot is written about improbability, this clever frenzy of a movie is somehow understandable enough to follow, for children and adults alike. Some argue that the film abandoned many traits from the original media forms of the franchise, but I for one think it's a refreshing combination. It's certainly an entertaining ride, but if the viewer is unfamiliar with the choppy pace and source of humor, they will most likely find themselves confused enough to become uninterested. However, for those with a mindset like Slartibartfast, content to ""hang the sense of it"" and enjoy themselves, it's an hour and fifty minutes of cheesy, British, geekiness that'll have you quoting Adams' iconic one-liners for days. As a kid, I enjoyed watching this movie because I liked the cheesy, over-the-top, crazy characters; as an adult watching the movie, I enjoy the script and narration the most. The Monty Python-like humor, nonsensical logic, and iconically witty lines still linger in my brain, long after I've watched the film.The main part of what makes this crazy story work as a full-length film, is the balanced acting. I think the movie would have suffered if Mos Def's portrayal of Ford was any crazier, or if Martin Freeman's Arthur was any less dramatic. Like a seesaw, if the acting was any crazier, the movie would be too weird, or if the acting was any more normalized, the film would easily be too boring. The balance between too much and too little was necessary to make this film adaption fit into the quirky franchise. Though there are many recognizable names in the cast, I think the actors in this movie were chosen well and I couldn't think of better people to replace them. A perfect example being Zooey Deschanel's role as Tricia McMillan (aka Trilian). Her deadpan style is perfect for the role and is a complete contrast to the zaniness of some of the other characters. Her determination and reasoning as the main female role is grounding, especially in scenes where all logic has been abandoned.What Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy fans are most commonly fond of, is how the dumb humor comes from false logic and reason. The movie captures that well through its appearance, I think. For how fake and zany the movie is, the photography is realistic and very sophisticated. My favorite scene, one where Arthur is being guided through a planet factory, has me starry eyed everytime I watch it (pun fully intended). The crispness of the digital imaging looks almost lifelike when combined with the actual photos of the Earth and other planets. In addition, the perspective filming of the scene makes it all the more captivating.The film for Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy captures Adams' mischievous irony, wistful idealism, and keen social observation in the best way possible. It's lovely cinematography and clever script writing blend together to create an environment that I think can be paired well with the novels, making it a fully enjoyable film for a fan of the other works.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

It was typical British humor and was by far one of my most memorable entertainment experiences ever. By the way, the radio play existed before any books were written for those who don't know.I did have my doubts if they could pull off a big screen version that lived up to the original radio script. In reality two hours is too short to properly tell the story with all the subtle but important details. Frankly I felt like it was a video trailer of the radio play.It was generally a pretty awful movie with no heart or spirit - OK, I was bored by it!!!

I wouldn't consider myself a crazy Hitchhikers fan, but I have read DNA's autobiography and have a autographed postcard from him stuck in my book. I have played Bureaucracy on my Apple IIc when I was young as well as the Hitchhikers game, and have seen the BBC TV mini-series.So I would say that I'm pretty familiar with the style, setting, and characters from the book. I was really concerned that this was going to be really bad. I had checked out the website just after news of the movie came out and was disappointed by what I saw. I never saw it in the theaters, and only just rented it last night.My wife on the other hand has never read the books and knows very little if at all about the controversies of the past attempts to bring the book to the theater and was a pretty good gage I think of the movie as a movie.We both liked it a lot. It really stands well on it's own. The only thing she said was ""What's the deal with the towels?"". I agree with some previous posts that they really missed a major Hitchhikerism by not simply referencing the Guide's importance of having a towel with you.As a HHGTTG purist, I was disappointed in the major plot deviation with the Huma Kavula stuff, but was curious that a previous poster mentioned that DNA specifically created it for the movie. I'll have to check that out. Anyway, I agree that much of the witty dialog of the book was absent (the bulldozer scene, and the really funny moment when the mice want to buy Arthurs brain off him). The thing I missed the most was Zaphod's other head. I know that even with the advanced CG that is available it would have been difficult to really have a two headed person, but it would double the impact of his acting in the movie, which I thought was very well done.I was really disappointed in the gun. It seemed like such a trite movie device. Bad guy wants gun. Must have hostage. Go get gun. But it did lead to the wonderful scene where we really get to see what Trillian feels. I loved that.Which reminds me that they must not have read the chapters on Deep Thought. Instead of an imposing machine that knows just about everything, it was an overgrown strange doll/troll/frog thing that was really weird.Finally I loved Slatibartfast. He was exactly how I pictured him. An excellent job of getting into the character. Generally the actors did great jobs. It's the structure they had to work in that was all wrong.One last thing...the dolphin song at the beginning, while having vestiges of funny Monty Python style chorus numbers, was really really bad.So, if I use my HHGTTG mind, it was far short, but just as a fun movie standing on its own, it was entertaining and amusing.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

Reading the book and then watching the movie will only make you unhappy, and if you haven't read the book you will be left clueless from the movie, since they are just trying to stuff to much into the movie and after the first 10minuts or so, they see its not possible and then go make their own story.So If you love the book, don't watch the movie If you haven't read the book and want to know stuff about it, don't watch the movie since it got close to nothing to do with the bookconclusion: Don't watch this movie.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

Radio play and serial had their own awkward places (the book is still perfect) but all in all were still very funny and did say to audience what they should've.If I seen this movie first I would never like to hear again about Hitchhiker. It's simply terrible movie! For those who knows the story it's truncated to the shape where even those don't know what's happening and on the top of that it's free of most famous quotes and sub-plots. They just don't happen no matter how important they are for whole atmosphere.Well, speaking sub-plots... the main plot is missing as well, changed is a bit little to say about it... it's completely different and confused.I know that Adams wrote screenplay to this, but I can imagine how screenplay can be different from the final result.... I would like to hear what he would thing about this wastrel. He would rotated in his grave... he sure would....Complete waste of time as I said... read the book... see the serial",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

746,Andrew83,Good version of a bad script,7,21 May 2005,"There are two ways at looking at this film depending on your position. if you are either a devoted Hitchhikers fan or someone who has never heard of it you'll probably think it's awful. The fans will be nitpicking every minor change to the originals and the newbies will complain that after one showing, they don't 'get it'. However, all the rest of us moviegoers, who've seen some properly bad films in our time, will be thoroughly entertained.Speaking from the latter perspective, the only major flaw is that the film hasn't managed to surmount the problem of turning a story that began as an episodic radio serial into a movie. The distinct chapters are still there, almost to the point of needing a 'Frasier' style act caption. This feeling is compounded by the decision to add copious amounts of new material into the plot - To those familiar with the original this movie feels a bit like an abridged version of what should be a trilogy of movies, or at the least a heavily edited-down final cut. A proper trilogy was never on the cards, this one film was always going be the first and last, so surely the film could have used more of the original. Presumably they had the rights. The new stuff would be OK for an original script but it pales somewhat compared to the Ruler of the Universe, The Total Perspective Vortex, Disaster Area, Zarniwoop, the flying party etc.What might have been a major flaw for most films is a minor quibble here because almost everything else is excellent. Hammer and Tongs get the point with Hitchhikers: It's genre description might be sci-fi comedy, but it really should be Genre: Interesting. If are any clichés in this film, I can't recall them. They even put a new slant (literally) on the 'spaceship gets hit by a missile' scene that Trek portrays with a stuntman somersaulting over an exploding console. Aside from the fantastic and imaginative production design, what really shows the production team's commitment to getting it right is the casting. Forced to include some Americans in the cast, they've pulled it off. Sam Rockwell is nearly as good as Mark Wing-Davey was in the original versions, and Mos Def is suitably weird yet cool as Ford, albeit a Ford that doesn't get much to do in the second half.This is because throughout the film the focus shifts back and forth between Zaphod's quest to get to Magrathea and the relationship between Arthur Dent and Trillian. Ford and Marvin are left on the sidelines somewhat. Fortunately Martin Freeman and Zooey Deschanel are such good fits for their characters that while the increased amount of romance occasionally comes close to melodrama, there is never an occasion that the viewer is left waiting for a 'good bit that has Marvin in it'.And there are enough 'good bits' in this movie.7/10",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
747,Corvayn,"Yet another missed opportunity - Some excellent scenes, bad plotting, characterisation, and music",4,2 May 2005,"I really wanted to like this. It had many absolutely stunning scenes, including the Vogon spaceship and the pull-back from the planet (and its destruction), the Vogans' appearance and characterisation, the planet factory floor, and the improbability drive effects (including all the characters turning into cloth puppets). Deep Thought was excellent, Marvin was okay though underused, and even the happy sighing doors got a look in. HoweverThe plot seemed to be missing its heart. It was sterile and uninvolving, and actually boring after the first few developments (in the loosest sense of the word), and the end provided no real payback. Nothing flowed, the extra plot elements were pointless, and it was difficult to care for any of the characters. The paint-by-numbers romantic hook was unbelievable and seemed pressed on with a lump of Blu Tack. Another missed opportunity was the music - one single bar of the excellent TV theme, and then everything returned to tune-free and generic soundtrackery, and two forgettable book-ending songs (""So long and thanks for all the fish""). Why did they not simply expand and re-score the TV theme? Also, I watched a digital presentation at the Printworks in Manchester, and though very good visually, there was something wrong with the sound  though the music was in stereo, the dialogue (except in one scene) was in mono, and only certain spot effects (such as the occasional whoosh) were in stereo. It was difficult to place objects and dialogue in any of the locations on screen, because there was a mismatch between what you saw and what you heard. For example, would you not expect some kind of reverb if you're in a big room such as the Vogon poetry reading chamber, or the Humma Kavula church? And unforgivably, ""The Guide"" itself was hardly used and completely lacked the funny and other-worldly feel of the TV version  the music to go with it was wrong, the jokes seemed to fall flat, and it just didn't work. You did not get the impression that what you were seeing was the friendly front end of a mind-boggling compendium of information, the scale was wrong, and the presentation was cheap, and not in a good way.Yet another missed opportunity. Watch it for the stunning scenes. Avoid it if you like plot or characterisation.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
748,crispindry,"Good FX, shame about the.......",3,5 May 2005,"What a dud! This film was so spectacularly unspectacular in terms of script, acting and direction. Visually the film was fantastic, the effects believable and original. But that was about the film's only saving grace. I thought the relationship between Arthur and Trisha/Trillian/whatever? was thoroughly unconvincing. Mos Def looked like he couldn't act his way out of a paper bag. Hard to believe he was on stage in the West End. Sam Rockwell tried his best as Zaphod but the script meant his character got fewer laughs than he should have done. By the middle I was bored of his spontaneous, insane laughter and we've seen this nonsense character before in numerous Jim Carrey films. Nothing new here. Stephen Fry's smug, pompous commentary also got tiresome as did the material he was reading. And Alan Rickman's voice for the android was horribly miscast. Great tone and resonance but hardly comical Al.As for the plot...well don't get me started. What happened? What was that ending about? What were the characters doing? It just seemed to be a series of sketches thrown together with the jokes being so obvious. Its been done before, and better.As for the britishness of it...how come three of the four main parts were given to Americans. To think of it as Monty Python in space is to discredit Monty Python to the power of 42. Yeah it was quirky and eccentric. That doesn't mean it was funny or good. It only gets a 3 off me for the effects.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
749,amachalepis,This is a good and faithful recreation of Hitchhikers,8,22 April 2005,"This is a good and faithful recreation of Adams' brilliantly sketchy radio series. Not surprising as Adams wrote the screenplay and was on the verge of having his dream realised when he suffered a fatal heart attack. A fitting credit at the end of the film ""For Douglas"" serves as a gentle reminder of the genius we have all lost. As for the film, many of the original and wonderful lines thankfully remain and the plot is largely unchanged. There's a new character or two written in for the film by Adams himself and they add to the overall story. John Malkovich is great albeit very briefly as religious leader Humma Kavula. Sam Rockwell, Mos Def and Martin Freeman all carry off their characters with wit and style whilst I felt Zooey Deschanel looked a little out of her depth. At times her dialogue seemed to get lost and her character seemed weaker than Sandra Dickinson's interpretation in the radio and TV series. Bill Nighy marries his own idiosyncrasies into the character of Slartibartfast seamlessly. Simon Jones makes a welcome cameo appearance as a holographic warning system. Stephen Fry steps well into the shoes vacated by Peter Jones as the ""Guides"" voice and you feel as if you are in safe hands. The ""Guides"" animated sequences are wonderfully reminiscent of Saul Bellow and though simple they are hilarious. For a feature directorial debut Garth Jennings does a grand job. I was half expecting the pop video influence to be apparent, but thankfully it wasn't. Lastly but not leastly a special mention has to go out to Jim Henson's creature workshop, this is probably the best work they have ever done in a feature, and that's saying a lot, given their success.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

If, on the other hand, you want to see a screen re-telling of what is probably the absolute best piece of comedic fiction, than just SKIP THE MOVIE. The story is horribly chopped, diced, and blended. Nearly half of the movie isn't in the book at all. I read this book for the first time over ten years ago, and have re-read at least twice a year since then (along with the other four books and one short story in the trilogy).

751,data-5,Surprised: not disappointed,9,8 May 2005,"I expected this movie to be bad. Most movies nowadays are, especially adaptations from books; and most especially adaptations from nearly sacred books like the Hitchhiker's Guide.But I was happily surprised. I enjoyed the heck out of it! Even my fiancée', who has only read bits of the book, really liked it. Go see it; it will make you happy too -- especially if you're a fan of the books, amazingly enough. And it wasn't dirty! They flirted with raciness but once -- then declined to indulge. This amazed me, considering it was made and financed by Hollywood. I thought civilised filmmakers were blacklisted -- but maybe not!This movie was, I think, made by people who love the books. They worked hard to put in as many of the greatest bits as they could; and they chose very well. So much is perfect. Marvin was perfect; Arthur Dent was perfect; and Zaphod, while not exactly as described in the book, was adapted perfectly for the screen -- the two heads side by side thing didn't work very well on the television show, so they wisely tried something else. And how much better he was played than on the television show!Mos Def as Ford Prefect seemed an odd choice to me at first, but the more I watched him, the more it made perfect sense. I didn't know Mos Def; I think I was expecting an Ice Cube rapper type. Not in the slightest! You'll have to see for yourself, but I absolutely loved him in that role. He will be my picture of Ford Prefect from now on. Normally I am displeased with the images a movie gives to my favorite books: not so this one. I'm actually glad for these illustrations. I'd like to read the book again so I can try them out.The makers did have an advantage with this story; since it began life as a radio script, and was only later adapted into a book, the story is rather fluid to begin with, so changing it again for an adaptation doesn't feel like a desecration. But they could have screwed it up a lot, and they didn't.There were a couple of missteps. I thought changing the professors who built Deep Thought to little girls was pointless; I wanted to see Adams' marvellous caricatures of academia in that role. Perhaps only a small set of people would have really appreciated it, but I doubt it. And while I thought the love-conquers-all element was charming, and softened the book's nihilistic overtones considerably, I think the writers may have worked themselves into a corner -- if they make any more movies, they'll have to deal with this rather large plot change somehow. But perhaps they've thought of that already.Never mind all that. I really, really liked this movie. I'm going to see it again. In fact, I kind of wish it were longer. But maybe they'll make ""Restaurant"" next. Please?",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
752,im-possible-music,the best sci-fi adventure since star wars,9,25 December 2007,"I have watched this movie several times. And i truly can't get enough. Garth Jennings must make a sequel at all costs. then make another and so on, until the book is completed. I created an account solely because of how strongly i feel about this. This has potential to be the best sci-fi movie i've ever seen. And the fact that it's a comedy doesn't change this fact. Speaking of which, it is also hysterical. Mos Def is hysterical and Sam Rockwell is as genius as always. The whole cast work together so perfectly that it would be a shame not to see them again. The Jim Henson puppets were a wonderful idea, truly bringing to life the various characters of the film. I can't stress how important it is to follow this project through to it's end. The mood of the film is poignant and subtle giving people that rare feeling that makes them watch it over and over.my only complaints: the second head could have been done better. No gregarious show tunes next time please.This could all be remedied in the sequel, the restaurant at the end of the universe. It's meant to be, Garth, don't give up so easily.ps.

753,hollieking81,An entertaining and insightful perspective on (western) society,10,23 June 2008,"I would like to start by saying I watched this after watching three quarters of ""A Mighty Heart"". I am amazed that a movie such as Hitchikers can actually have more of an insight on life through the use of imaginative metaphors and satire than attempts to represent life through a morbid (albeit historically accurate)documentary-style of cinema which was -- you guessed it! the latter movie. A movie such as Hitchhikers is virtually impossible to come by these days.In saying this I don't wish to trivialize the 'Angelina with a bad accent' movie, however I want to point out what a refreshing and enlightening change Hitchikers was without forcing morbid images into your retina to prove it's point. Now, although I had previously heard OF 'The Hitchikers Guide to the Galaxy' radio plays and books on numerous occasions, I had never actually experienced them- and despite this fact, I subconsciously avoided the movie based upon its barrage of negative criticism- because I thought- ""well, there's another stinker to be avoided"".After seeing Hitchikers Guide I certainly intend to delve a little deeper into Douglas Adams perspectives on life in general. His concepts are witty and hilarious- I must admit I was always a fan of British humor, and this style of comedy felt reminiscent of the like of the 'Young Ones' and the cult TV series 'The Red Dwarf'. So if that style of comedy is up your alley, then you would tend to like this little ripper.I was in tears through most of it, due to it's honest reflection of the glorious marvels and also the plain stupidity present within human existence (particularly in the Western world I would think) and its subtle focuses which are too numerous to mention (the couches!! the flying pot plant!! The flying whale!! the list goes on) really are an an attempt to reflect the emphasis we shall say- the western world, place on pointless trivialities opposed to the overall picture (ie the destruction of the earth).I couldn't decided whether I was laughing from its satirical comedy or out of agreement with its mocking of themes: from Christianity through to the Public Service- and Adams has done this in such a way that made you feel like it contained so many layers, it would be easier to dismiss it as a silly little movie instead of something more.This included the fact that Zophod (James Rockwell) was representative of a whacked out Jesus who had no idea about anything except that he was famous, which included his being responsible for the ultimate destruction of the world (amongst other things).The casting was fantastic- and the fact that Ford was played by Mos Def was an added treat. I honestly could not really flaw it.I am sure it is being set up for a sequel (restaurant at the end of the world/galaxy or something- so I am told?) and I wait for it in eager anticipation. Hopefully the dolphins agree.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

But that might not have been a problem, if made in the ""spirit"" of the book.. or at least in a comical, fun way..The original film was great, but the special effects where slightly.. hooky... So I hoped at least that Sephods head was going to be more convincing in the new film. But it was WORSE !!!

You are never going to see a film made that completely captures every nuance of the book. In fact, it won't even be close. Remember the Lord of the Rings trilogy? Surely a series of fine movies, which lopped off the final chapters of the final book, which completely changed the book's intent of seeing the Hobbits coming of age into essentially a war movie. To those that enjoyed the movie, I salute you. You got it. To those that said, the BBC series was better or the book was better or any other presentation was better than the movie, sorry but unless you use the Improbability Drive, you are comparing whales to petunias. The movie stands on its own. While I will admit it was not Gone With the Wind or Citizen Kane, it was an hour and forty-nine minutes of pure Adams. Here is my suggestion: Rent the movie, sit down, watch it, pretend you never heard of Adams or read the books or saw the series on BBC, and take the movie at face value.

I remember when it had just come out and people were complaining that Ford was not the same.. why would you want 'the same' thats what 1981 was about this is a 2005 version and therefore it is a different version. The comedy is still there, the jokes are still there and things are generally the same, but different. I must say that although I grew up on the original version I still love the new version too.

758,m1jrc,"Not as bad as expected, but a true missed opportunity.",5,1 May 2005,"I've been a fan of The Hitchhikers Guide since the original radio series so I realised that any modern movie adaptation condensed in to less than 2 hours would have to make sacrifices. The original radio series, TV series and books all had slightly different plots and the movie is no different, while keeping some the basics of the original story. What is a shame is how really great lines appear to have been cut for no apparent reason. While many of the expected scenes are present, they seem somehow shallow and distant, as if someone didn't really have their heart in it.This isn't a really bad movie however, but for long time fans it just feels a little empty and I suspect anyone new to the story would leave feeling confused, actually I suspect everyone will  maybe that's the point! I saw the film with my 6 year old son (who's a fan of the TV series) and he enjoyed it but also said the TV version was better. In addition, the cinema showed 20 mins of trailers including one that was 12 rated before the main (PG) film (but after the advertised start time).Much worse than the film itself however was the appalling picture quality and experience at the cinema I visited (a major multiplex in Staines). Even though the film had only been out for two days the picture had all the noise, judder and blur of a very poor Super-8 home movie. While the sound was generally OK, the poor picture and flicker (much worse than a 50Hz TV) meant I left the cinema with a real headache vowing never to return.I don't know if my cinema experience was typical but if you've not been to the movies in a few years it's worth baring in mind that waiting for the DVD may give you a better picture for less money  and if you're a true fan you can watch it again and again.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
759,thepenguinslide,Funny...but in a different way.,10,30 April 2005,"I'm a long time Hitchhiker fan, and I laughed my head off. But I laughed at jokes that didn't seem too Douglas Adams-like. There were some Douglas Adams jokes, but a lot of it seemed like a combination of Jerry Zucker and Andy Breckman mixed with Douglas Adams with a dash of Mel Brooks. So, pretty much, on its own, the film stands as real funny, but if you were to put it through a filter that would only leave Adamsesque humor, you would be disappointed.The plot has been butchered from the book, but not in a bad way, but not in a good way either. It really is a mediocre plot change, doesn't help anything, but doesn't hurt. The first 20 minutes and the last 20 are pretty close to the book but the middle hour has gone topsy turvy. I must also note that the ending is very well done, despite its slight deviation from the book, it really does give it a more theatrical sense.Martin Freeman is satisfactory but hard to connect with, as you did in the TV series. Mos Def is surprisingly funny, but not in the way David Dixon was, its a completely new Ford and I like him. Sam Rockwell has displayed some great work here as well. Zooey? I wasn't a fan. I think she is attractive and not that bad of an actress, but her acting was sub-par. To her benefit though, her non-verbal acting was interesting, just don't expect any awards for her. The voices were spectacular, including Alan Rickman and Bill Bailey's hilarious turn as a water mammal.Overall, if you go in expecting pure Adams, I don't think you'll be happy, so take what it is. If you're going in as an Adams Virgin, you'll enjoy it, as long as you let the lunacy take you over, and you don't ask questions like ""Wait...why doesn't this follow the typical three act structure?""",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

I have read it a couple of times over the years, and I think it is one of the funniest books ever written and certainly up there with the Monty Python style of humour that I am a huge fan of.And the thing I love so much about the book is the STYLE in which the book is written, the subtle jokes in the narration, and the silly events that happen out of nowhere. The only problem that this does not or can not appear in the film.I don't blame the film for this, as in retrospect I don't think a film adaptation should have been made. The BBC series of the film was much better (if not as good looking), but it did manage to get most of the jokes that appear in the dialogue -- just to me the best ones are in the narration.As a film it just didn't work. I don't think that the characters got the best out of them, and the casting just didn't seem to work. The only person I really liked was Sam Rockwell as Zaphod Beeblebrox (but that may be because he's brilliant in everything), and I thought Alan Rickman and Stephen Fry were inspired as voicing Marvin and the Guide respectively.Overall a disappointing film indeed.

After seeing it, however, I felt like there could have been and should have been more to it. There are many scenes in the movie where it seemed as if it was simply thrown into the movie to keep it true to the book without any explanation as to why. I know that movies are cut to make them a ""watchable"" length but things can't be cut out that are needed to explain parts of a movie. (This is why the Lord of the Rings movies did so well. They did not sacrifice content for length.) After seeing it I wanted to read the book to fully understand the story and the background behind many behaviors such as always having a towel, the purpose of which never became clear to me. The only time it came close was when it was used to whip the dumb alien guys trying to come from behind at the end. The movie wasn't a total waste of time, though, it was worth seeing.

Adams books are clever, smart and thoughtful. And funny - mostly because of the former. The movie is neither clever nor smart - and hence not funny. There are some visual effects... but everything else is... wrong. Casting, dialogue, story... If you have not read the books, you might rate this movie a bit higher, but still, I warn you.

I wanted to like this film, and in fact, some parts I absolutely loved. The scene where the Earth is destroyed, leading to the wonderful ""Journey Of The Sorcerer"" theme music, is sublime, and achingly beautiful.I also loved the way many of the characters were portrayed. Stephen Fry was born to play the Guide itself, Mos Def was sufficiently odd in his performance as Ford Prefect, and Martin Freeman was a good choice for Arthur (although I was less impressed when I read that he decided not to read the books the film was based upon). Bill Nighy makes a good Slartibarfast, and even though I would have preferred a frostier, more British Trillian, Zooey Deschanel did a solid job of playing her. Alan Rickman, is, of course a brilliant Marvin, although I find Stephen Moore's radio version of him to be the definitive Paranoid Android. I even enjoyed Sam Rockwell's rather manic Zaphod.So...the actors aren't necessarily a problem. So why did it hurt for me to watch it? Well, the moments of brilliance in this film belong to Adams, who was a master of dialogue, and twisting plots (a great deal of which is missing from the film), and by no means do I have a problem with changes made, as Adams always talked about 'flatly contradicting' previous incarnations of the story as he went along (from radio to book to television, and presumably, to movie), but you can almost see where Adams' ideas disappear and liberties are taken.Almost, but not quite.My problem is that it is hard to see where Adams was going to take this one, and due to the world's tragic, early loss of him, we never will. Any remake will either be like this film, or a carbon-copy of the books (not such a bad thing, but not what Adams talked about). In terms of the plot of this film, I can only speculate, but the 'love interest' between Arthur and Tricia seems very un-Adams, although the 'point of view gun' sounds very much like one of his ideas. The sad thing is that we'll never know for sure.To make a (very) long review somewhat shorter, I enjoyed some of it (the effects were astounding. Loved the Vogons), but felt that it was a bit anaemic in terms of plot and characterisation. In the end, I would rather see a true-to-the-book version than this half-finished, and patchy film.If you haven't read the books, this film should entertain, but by all means, read them.

765,Ficer67,Poor Douglas is probably rolling in his grave.,1,30 April 2005,"Do not go to see this movie, if you are expecting to see, ""The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy."" I expected to see a version of the guide that adheres to the plot line of the books, but with all of the special effects that we have come to expect today. Instead, I saw a sci-fi comedy only loosely based on the books. Obviously, some director or producer, or writer thought that the books were not funny enough, and tried to add some of his own material. Alternatively, that person may have thought the original books were too, ""cerebral."" Whatever the case, the books and previous iterations there-of (radio show, TV series, etc.) were much better.If they had named it something else, it would probably be better, but not my much.Definitely wait for it to come out on DVD.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
766,swansoj-nitsu,"People of Earth Earth, Your Attention Please.",8,7 May 2005,"You know, for the last 20 odd years I have hoped, but never thought, that I would actually be able to say that I'd seen The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy movie. Let's look at some of the big questions that seem to have been preoccupying the minds of many like me too as of late.Is it as good as the original radio series? No. Of course it isn't. It never could be. It never even stood a chance. Even the new radio series isn't as good as the original radio series and it's got most of the original cast in it. The original radio series has been around so long now that it has passed into the realm of legend. Indeed, amongst a certain fan demographic it is virtually sacred. No movie could ever hope hold a candle to the original radio series. It's a pointless comparison. Forget about it and move on. We'll always have Golgafrincham.Is it better than the television series? Undoubtedly, yes. But let's look at this a little more closely. The television series was made by the BBC with Eighties technology, on a budget of about £17.62, a book of Luncheon Vouchers and the help of a small hard working elderly snail called Eric. Whereas Disney made the movie with modern day CGI technology, a budget of millions and employed the talents of Jim Henson's Creature Shop. So, how do you think it's going to stack up by comparison?Are the characters the same? Of course. Sam Rockwell is excellent; Bill Nighy is superb; Helen Mirren does a Deep Thought with a difference and Zooey Deschanel's performance is a pleasant surprise. But, just what is it that we are weighing up here? Martin Freeman plays a very good Arthur Dent, but he does fairly lousy Simon Jones. But then, he's not playing Simon Jones, is he? In the same way that Sam Rockwell is not playing Mark Wing Davey, Mos Def isn't playing Geoffery McGivern (or David Dixon come to that  who, in turn, wasn't playing Geoffrey McGivern either  in fact, I always felt he was doing more of a Dr Who thing anyway) and Alan Rickman, who is not playing Stephen Moore*, does a marvellous maniacally depressed android. We have a different bunch of people who bring their own interpretations to their roles. After all, that's what this acting lark is all about, isn't it?Is the movie true to the concept of the original Guide? Most very definitely, yes. Hammer & Tongs clearly understood the material. And what about all the old stuff we grown to cherish and hold so very dear? Obviously, some things didn't make it into the movie. The entire canon of Guide entries doesn't make it, but some of them turn up visually, such as the plethora of jewelled encrusted crabs scuttling about during almost every Vogon scene. Not all of the old stuff fares as well. The whole ""in the basement inside a locked filing cabinet in a disused lavatory with a sign saying Beware of the leopard"" thing gets cut down to ""they were in the cellar"". Someone please tell me why. The movie makes more of the relationship between Arthur and Trillion. This has made a lot of people very angry and has been widely regarded as a bad move. I must admit, that it didn't really work for me, but then it didn't spoil my enjoyment of the movie either. In the end though, it all effectively comes back to the same place. Our heroes still manage to accomplish pretty much all the same things they have always done and we still get to see a displaced sperm whale and a reincarnated bowl of petunias with sudden attack of deja vu. And so we come to the final and critical acid test. After all this time, all these changes, cuts and all these new people getting their mitts on the material, is it still funny. Let's ask a purist. Hey, I'm a purist! I'm so pure that I'm sad. I'm so sad I quote verbatim from the scriptures at will. ""I'm so cool you could keep a side of meat in me for a month. I'm so hip I have difficulty seeing over my own pelvis."" So, let's ask me then. Yes, it's still funny. A different funny than what I'm used to in places, but it is still funny. A whole new world (""Oh no, not another one."") of virgin fans can now get a kick out of this story. It is what the Guide should be. It is fun. I enjoyed it. I'll probably be humming ""So Long and Thanks for All the Fish"" for some considerable time to come. But don't just take the word of a sad rambling towel clutching old hitchhiker, who sometimes also goes by the name of Rooster. Go see it, help boost the box office and maybe, just maybe they'll make The Restaurant at the End of the Universe. Just maybe.(*Stephen Moore was a National Theatre player.)",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
767,selaromhsoj,Absolutely LOVED IT,10,29 April 2005,"I am a big fan of the series. I have the original broadcast on mp3 and have the BBC TV series too, as well as the ultimate book collection with all of the books from the series in one. It is practically my bible, not only because it's such a great story, but because of how accurately it reflects our lives, even though we all get blown up and are no part of the story...If you are going to this movie with the expectation to recite the book along with it word-for-word, you will probably be disappointed. But if you want to see a Douglas Adams movie, you will leave the theater fully satisfied!! I was really, REALLY worried I was going to hate this film, because it is a Disney film (BLEH!), but the screenplay was indeed written by Douglas Adams and it shows! It was a really good translation; if you liked Holes and weren't disappointed with the movie translation, you will probably definitely enjoy this one! The sharp wit of Adams is present in every scene, as are the most important (and humorous) elements of the book. I started to worry when some parts started to trail away from the storyline of the book, but then it got right back on track, and looking back, there isn't a thing I would change.Like most people are saying, it is different from the book. But it holds its own as a great movie too! This is an EXCELLENT rendition of the classic story, and I enjoyed it immensely! Go see it, and don't forget your towel! -SelArom",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
768,akhnlogos,douglas wouldn't have HATED it,7,1 May 2005,"i was fully prepared for this film to be a mess with few redeeming features. given how wonderful the book was, it would have been unfair to expect that kind of unique greatness to be duplicated. in the end, i think it was a good film. not quite a great film, but a lot of fun that followed enough of the book to be reasonably faithful, with lots of forgivable compromises in the attempt to turn great literature into well-decent cinema.HHGG fans will be unavoidably split on this one. some are going to love that douglas adams' most famous work has finally gotten the big-budget big-screen treatment; others are going to hate it for not being everything the book was. the fact is, it's easier to write lots of fantastic and crazy things than it is to film them believably in a span audiences will tolerate, and i don't think the requisite suspension of disbelief was any greater than for other far less creative scions of Hollywood.yes, the abduction of trillian was contrived. yes, zaphod was underdeveloped and short two heads & a face. yes, marvin and the vogons were a bit caricatured. there are lots of faults to this film, but none of them are yawning fissures, if you are simply willing to be whisked away into a two-hour diversion of adventure.in conclusion, this movie could have been better. it could also have been a LOT worse. it was fun though, and that's all the HHGG was ever supposed to be, really. just good fun! i think douglas would have approved.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
769,Tompickford,A Disappointingly Shallow Adaptation,4,3 May 2005,"If you go to see this movie expecting a faithful recreation of one of the best Sci-fi comedies ever written, think again. Thankfully, it bears little resemblance to the appalling TV series of the 80s, but obviously the translation to film has not been smooth. The plot has been adjusted, presumably to make it more palatable to the movie-going public. However, this detracts rather than adds to the film, as the additions to the story are merely extra sequences of silliness, and the new characters make only brief appearances and are then quickly relegated to the background.The cast at first glance would appear quite reasonable, particularly with Alan Rickman as the voice of Marvin and Bill Nighy as Slartibartfast. However, their characters are so underdeveloped and the dialogue so brief that we never get the chance to enjoy them. Marvin seems to just repeat the one line ""I'm so depressed"" throughout the whole film, and Slartibartfast's obsession with Fjords is only briefly mentioned. The acting of the rest of the cast is dismissible, particularly as Martin Freeman does not seem to have progressed from his role as Tim in the office. Mos Def as Ford Prefect is a perfect example of the bad casting, and Ford's contribution to the film has been reduced so much that he almost becomes the token black guy. Zooey Deschanel as Trillian is another unusual choice, and her performance is fairly average. Zaphod, however, is a different story. Sam Rockwell plays him to a tee, full of energy and self-absorption. His arrogant and disarming grin steals many a scene. Stephen Fry is also a good choice as the voice of the book, as are the cast of the League of Gentleman who voice the Vogons perfectly.The Vogon puppets themselves are very well designed and executed, as are all the special effects in the film. The Vogon ships and sets are very grimy and geometric, as you'd expect, and look great. However, the decision to put Zaphod's second head underneath his first seems very much like a cheap ploy to avoid the hassle of creating a side-by-side setup. It feels like all of the time and money has gone into these special effects and sets, and the script and story suffer because of it. Nevertheless, there were some sequences which provoked chuckles. Memorable scenes include the sequence when the camera keeps panning back from Arthur's house right out to space past the Vogon fleet, and when the crew of the Heart of Gold turn into woolly puppets during an Improbability jump.However, as mentioned before, the dazzling effects do not detract from the bad script and acting. What was humorous in the book just isn't funny on screen, and too many of the jokes have been left out. The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy could probably never translate well onto the screen, as demonstrated aptly by the TV series, and while the film does surpass the series in many ways, fans of the books and radio series will be disappointed.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

Also, I missed the Restaurant at the End of the Universe, which was probably the best idea in the original series. Finally, I thought the beginning, demolition and so on, was OK but then it went down all the time.

773,johnspam,Much worse than the BBC TV series,1,27 April 2005,"As a kid in the early 80's I enjoyed Douglas Adam's books immensely, & as any school kid did at the time learned whole passages of THHGTTG verbatim. If only there had been an end of year exam I may have gone on to university. Fast forward several years (or decades - I don't remember) and I have just walked out of the British premiere of the new movie in Leeds (a first for me). Lacking any of the subtlety of Adam's humor that made the radio shows and book so popular in the 80's and acted as badly, if not worse than the TV series, this movie is a horror. It is obvious that the producers have never made a movie before; the plot is a mess the whole thing chops around all over the place with bits thrown in for no apparent reason like the Humma Kavula & Questular Rontok characters. This movie is lazy, sloppy, badly shot, and grainy - looks like it was shot on digicam. I kept waiting for the film to settle down and find its rhythm however it never did, nor did it look like it was going to when I walked out whilst Arthur & Trillian were taking a shower. I cannot really think who could have pulled off a movie of HHG maybe Terry Gilliam, The only saving grace is a cameo by the original Marvin from the BBC series. Truly awful.

The only thing that could have made it worse would have been an appearance by Paris Hilton. I mean every time i thought it might get better, it didn't. I guess i was thinking it would be humorous in a sort of ""Monty Pythons Holy Grail"" sort of way, but it ended up being awful in a ""Ishtar"" sort of way.

I followed it from the first broadcast, through all the TV programmes, and on to the last two books in the trilogy.This movie is an utter sell-out to American audiences, and it misses almost all of the things that made it so popular. (And it won prizes when shown on British TV for originality - all of that was left out).Ford is supposed to be pseudo-English, and Marvin is supposed to overcome his awful state. Eddie, who was an epitome of American superficiality, is sanitised. Zaphod - oh well he was a caricature of American superficiality anyway.If you're American, enjoy it, and remember that you don't understand intellectual humour.The things that are left out are breathtaking. So many brilliant one-liners, and in their place is a whole lot of slapstick.There can be no sequel because you couldn't have this Ford and the Krikitt wars together.If you're English or even an Anglophile, don't go anywhere near this appalling monstrosity.

Sci-fi fans are like parents who relish every little moment. Oh look, Data used his first contraction, oh look, Anakin built his first light saber. Hitchhiker was no different. The theater I went to was filled to the brim with people who knew every in-joke, every nod, every punchline that didn't make it film (which I'm told was well over 80%). By the way, knowing a joke, doesn't make it funny. And this movie just is not funny. Not in the least. Every review I've heard that slams those of us that hated this movie, well we're told we just didn't get it. Well you're right. I didn't get it. And I'll wear that badge with honour. I didn't care about the characters, I thought Zaphod was a poor man's Dennis Hopper doing a bad Elvis impression, I thought the romance was about as strong as the one Will Smith had in Men In Black II (the second worst movie I've ever seen in theaters). Alan Rickman was wasted talent. And that damn dolphin song is just insipid enough to get stuck in your head and stay there for days reminding you at every turn that you went and spend $9 on this steaming pile of crap. People will say DA would be proud for what was accomplished. No. Actually he'd die a second time if he saw this. Had he lived, well maybe that's what killed him in the first place.

I prefer him to Simon Jones, because he manages ""ordinary"" without ""irritating"". You could actually understand a woman being interested in this Arthur.Zooey Deschanel as Trillian: gets the mix of intelligence and vulnerability far better than Sandra Dickinson Zaphod's second head: very neatly done.The Magrathea building area: magnificent effects.Criticisms: the character of Ford Prefect was severely underutilised. Once he had got Arthur aboard the Vogon ship, he was pretty much irrelevant, instead of being the pivotal figure.The bulldozer scene outside Arthur's house was disappointingly trimmed.On occasion, I found myself mentally filling in gaps from the story as I knew it, so it may well have been more difficult for those not versed in H2G2 lore to follow.But all in all, a thoroughly enjoyable couple of hours.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

However, the people around me (albeit in NY) were laughing and at the correct points, so maybe it does.The one thing that it suffers from though is for anyone brought up on Hitchhker's is that the story and characters are so real - I spent too much time analysing whether the new line up worked.Martin Freeman was born for this character and, dare I say it, better than the original -or maybe more appropriate for the age - not as pathetic and 70's as the original character.Ford and Zaphod. I think Ford was in the movie but fail to remember him contributing. Zaphod though - Sam Rockwell plays psycho-ego maniac very well.Though this is picking.

And it's funny, too.Don't go into this movie expecting a coherent plot line, characters that make sense, or even that all the major elements of the plot will make be understood. That's not what this movie is about. At one point, a character mentions that he'd ""rather be happy than right"" any day. That is this movie. It won't make an iota of sense--and its not really supposed to. Just enjoy the ride.P.S. One note: Reading the book is not mandatory to understanding what plot the movie has, as it won't really help you. However, if you want to understand some elements of the story, its a quick read.

And the ending is a bit abrupt and happy-ever-after. I also preferred the generally puzzled and diffident manner of the TV series' Arthur Dent (Simon Jones). Mos Def is wild as Ford, but again I preferred the TV series' mostly cool and strangely innocent-seeming David Dixon. For me, the TV series and the books are cleverer and funnier.

I thought the direction was decent (good for a first time effort), and the effects aided the story and were employed for some nice humorous elements. No...it wasn't as good as the book, but very few films have ever lived up to their source material. Yes some things were left out, unexplained, or completely superfluous, but many films suffer from these problems.

783,marizma_h-1,This movie could have used more Douglas Adams and less Hollywood.,7,30 April 2005,"Overall, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy was very well-done. Even adding a new character (Humma Kavula) worked out to the film's advantage. For me, what ruined the movie was the rather pointless love story between Arthur and Trillian. Adding that in made the film seem over-Hollywoodized (yes, I'm aware that's not actually a word!) and cheap. It took up far too much time and was far too typical to be associated with such a brilliant story. The romantic element was completely unnecessary, and could have been left out without damaging the integrity of the film.The casting was very good, for the most part.Sam Rockwell was great, if a little over-the-top (In the books Zaphod isn't QUITE so dumb). Alan Rickman as the voice of Marvin was so unquestionably PERFECT, I could not think of anyone else with the ability to capture the character as well as he did. Martin Freeman did a great job looking bewildered in his dressing-gown as Arthur Dent, although his performance was shadowed by the constant mooning over Trillian like a lovesick puppy. Zooey Deschanel as Trillian was a fairly good choice, but in the books she isn't given quite so large a role and there is probably a good reason for it. Personally I didn't care for Mos Def as Ford Prefect, he mumbled too much and seemed to be quiet and uncomfortable rather than a savvy hitchhiker who always knows where his towel is.Thanks to the 'magic of Hollywood' a fantastic book has been turned into a mediocre and somewhat typical sci-fi comedy. The funniest moments are the ones straight from the books, rather than the gags inserted just for this film. If you enjoy movies containing either Adam Sandler, Steven Seagal or Jim Carrey, you might furrow your brows at the dry British wit and wonder where the poop jokes and machine guns are, then log on to IMDb and register your disgust in a poorly spelled review. Anyone who doesn't 'get' the Hitchhiker series should save their money and go see xXx: State of the Union, instead of trying to wrap their Nascar-addled brains around a far superior form of humour. (To the guy in front of me in the theater who said, ""Huh? What's so great about towels?"": you wouldn't last a day in the rest of the galaxy. Sorry.)Basically, I would recommend this to anyone looking for a decent adaptation of a fantastic book. Do yourself a favour, though, and go get popcorn during the 'romantic' scenes.

Though the details of the book may not have been followed exactly it is still wonderful. Also, considering the fact that Adams wrote the screen play, and that no two versions of HHG have been the exact same, the inconsistencies are justifiable. The only real issues I had with the movie were: Ford's character wasn't portrayed as the book had made him seem, Ford's purpose on earth was hardly mentioned, Zaphod's head issue and the lack of explanation of bath towels. Besides that, it was a hilarious flick. I was somewhat shocked at the lack of people in the cinema though.

Although it has wonderful effects and although the section with Slartibartfarst is excellent it scores very poorly against the books, radio, records or BBC TV series. Having just watched the TV series again after the new feature film it's easy to see how (in general) the movie graphics and special effects are far superior to the TV series (the Vogons are particularly great looking - although they sound disinterested rather than evil).The actors in the movie are simply wooden and there is simply no empathy with the characters (Trillian is played in a particularly irritating way). The movie moves with the pace of an Arcturan Megacamel (very slowly) and the movie is an insult to the intelligence. It's simply terribly dull and tedious. There's a real lack of humour in the movie as well. Sad as Adams was involved in talks for many years to get this movie made.One area where the movie scores very badly is the book animations.

I've been tracking the process of the film, and I'm like obsessed, so I don't know how people who are new to the story would see it, but it started out great! Love how it was all put together, the only thing about it was it was very fast moving compared to other versions... but thats fine because the other versions are old now, and in modern day, everyones high on coffee, and life's fast pace.... Any way, the middle of the film was good to, the Humma Kuvada(spelling?) didn't really go anywhere, but it was funny and as an obsessed fan whos been tracking the films progress from the beginning, I understand Douglas Adams only did one draft of the script before he died, so this new character and sub plot weren't fully developed. Basically the film was a great new take, coz every new version or reincarnation of the hhg is slightly different, and the only bad thing was the corny happy ending and the Arthur Trillian love thing. I understand the whole thing as to trillian was supposed to have more character this version this time, but the whole point of the two liking each other was that the whole time you want them to hookup, but they never do. Arthur likes her, but he doesn't do anything about it. Hahaha... It's supposed to be ironic funny. But this was commercialised, and Disney-fied, so now it's just soppy and makes kids my age go ""ewwww...."" So from the point of a 12 year old.... GREAT JOB! But for the sequel, son't commercialise it to make it good for everyone. Keep it unique... thats what made everyone fall in love with the story in the first place, so don't you think it would work again? Your not fooling any one... this story is great as it is... keep the 'Average film' stuff out of it. It's weird, funny, and great.

If Douglas Adams had lived to see it, he would have hated this film. You must be joking.It sucks. Horribly. It should be a fast-paced, hilarious romp. Instead it is a slow-as-molasses mess. A love story? Please. There's no love story in the book. And what is this gun? And who is the character Malkovich is playing? Did the people who made this movie read the book?

789,bloodoranges,Complete butchery.,2,7 June 2005,"As a fan of the radio plays, books and TV series, I was nervous but hopeful about this film. However, not only was this badly cast, it also failed to entertain the uninitiated and pacify the die-hard fans. I did not expect a re-make of the TV series in film form, but I was anticipating something both funny and faithful. While there were some subtle references in there to keep the fans happy, too many of them were mismanaged. I left feeling disgusted and let down. Even Alan Rickman's delivery was terrible. If you want to see a funny, entertaining, faithful take on the original plays and books, watch the TV series and give the film a miss. If you haven't read the books, you should do that instead of wasting your money on a cinema ticket.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
790,thod_rouman,4/10. Some positives but more negatives. You may be disappointed...,4,15 July 2012,"First of all, i loved the character of ""Marvin""... He really adds an alternative mood in the movie. Also, the special effects are very nice; some magnificent views of planets, locations and generally stunts and space stuff are quite impressive.On the other hand, the progression of the story isn't that exciting. Until the final 15 minutes of the movie, the story was really slow, not real action and the plot isn't what i expected. The costumes and the appearances of the aliens were really poor, too. Also the fact that we see human-formed aliens is really disappointing in my opinion. Such cases are literally unbelievable as one would expect evolution (in the director's head) to be much more creative. Finally, the laws of physics don't really apply to this movie. And i'm not talking about simple stuff we don't realize as the movie progresses. I'm talking about the ""improbability"" factor that, as you'll see, is a bit unbelievable! To sum up, it isn't a huge disaster but it really disappointed me as I was expecting A LOT more from it...",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

Had I never read the book, it would have been a very good experience. Special effects were very good, characters were great, and casting was excellent. As usual though, when you have read the book first, a movie can be a bit of a let down though. Several of my favorite scenes in the book were completely omitted: no bird people, no statue of Dent, the restaurant at the end of the Universe was only mentioned briefly, the story line with Zaphod Beeblebrox redeeming himself wasn't there, the uses of the towels was never really explained, NO DOLPHINS, I could go on and on, and the ending, well, not at all what I expected.

793,tuoni42,Fantastic,9,1 May 2005,"I'd just like to comment about this quote from the previous reviewer first: ""Often, the picture will simply stop and explain what's on screen bluntly, to help the majority of viewers out there who wouldn't know a Babel Fish from a Vogon. It helps in gaining a crisp understanding of Dent's journey (and the breadth of Adams's imagination), but has a tendency to stop the film cold..."" Which, while true, is how the book is written. I for one give them credit for keeping quite true to Adams' writing style and transferring that onto the big screen.Is it true to the book? No, but Adams has said on many occasions that he didn't want all the versions to be the same and has even made points that he didn't know what the characters looked like. (See interview by Adams describing how he was unsure what Marvin really looked like.) Those who are avid readers of the series will see the obvious differences, but will appreciate the inclusion of many of their favorite lines from the previous versions of the series as well as cameo appearances of some of the BBC characters.Both avid readers and Hitchhiker virgins will appreciate the way the roles were taken on by the actors, all playing their roles so well that it's hard to pick a favorite - although I will say Mos Def as Ford was priceless. He truly pulled off an alien trying to figure out Earth existence in a way that I believe very few could do.I loved it. My friends who are fans of the series loved it. You have to go into the movie expecting it to stand on it's own and not be a carbon copy of the previous versions to truly enjoy the experience. And as someone who rarely sees movies in the theater, I think it's saying quite a lot that I plan to see it at least once more before it leaves the theaters - and then you will see me on line at my local movie store the day it comes out on DVD.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
794,Rataplan,"Fun, the other way round",7,21 August 2005,"The movie borrows an awesome lot of punches from Douglas Adams' novels, but it is actually a wholly different story. This movie is the story of Arthur Dent c.s. against the backdrop of a rather bewildering Universe, while the original books are actually a story about the Universe, set against the backdrop of a bewildered Arthur Dent. The books really only need Arthur Dent to stitch a lot of weird (and possibly human) views together; the movie tells his story and as far as I'm concerned that is the major flaw of this production. The books pose a lot of social commentary that this movie just doesn't do justice, and nothing the movie does can make up for this rather gargantuan misinterpretation. So if you've read the books: this is where it all comes down, I guess. But it's not about the books. It carries its own weight, with wonderful dolphins, a brilliant(-ly cast) Marvin ,a wholly remarkable Ford and a credible set of mice, all fused neatly together with a coherent story. As most fans, I see three setbacks: the double head of mr. Beeblebrox that didn't work, the lack of a climax (but do I smell a sequel? good!) and of course the romantic angle that I could've well done without, but that goes side by side with the misinterpretation of the books. I guess the story could do with a little extra spice since the key player - the Universe - had been moved to the background.Technically, there is very little wrong with this movie. The only reason I didn't rate it higher is that I would have liked the books' Universal and socially critical angle better, but that's me. A solid effort, and well worth two tickets.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
795,pete-harman,What a disappointment.,5,17 September 2005,"I had really hoped that this film would be good. REALLY hoped. I would rather have been trampled to death by the ravenous bugblatter beast of Traal than to have to admit that this latest incarnation of Douglas Adams' classic tale fell short of perfection.BUT....Aren't pictures so much better on the radio? Or come to that, on 1980's low-budget thrown-together science fiction TV series. I am afraid that during the 90-odd minutes that the movie lasts, I found my mind asking repeated questions such as ""why did they miss THAT bit out"" or ""that unnecessary piece of slapstick doesn't work - why not edit it out, and replace it with something worthy of Douglas's memory"".For example, the babelfish definition explained, almost to the word of the original, how this amazing creature converts sound waves to brainwaves, enabling universal communication. So why leave out the bitter-sweet codicil the ""this probably contributed more to intergalactic war than any other thing in the Universe""? The TV series consisted of 6 30-minute episodes (= 3 hours) and covered the first 2 books. The movie lasts for (apparently) a little over half of this time, and covers the first book. So why couldn't they pack as much detail in the film as appeared in the TV series? Maybe the Arthur/Trillian love interest got in the way, or perhaps it was 'dumbed down' for the cinema-going masses? Seems like a raw deal for those for whom the movie was their first experience of H2G2.Overall, a bit sad that the end of the earth should come, not with a bang, but a turkey.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

797,Anakin_McFly,Better than expected,7,16 August 2005,"I admit that after seeing several bad reviews for this movie, I was prepared for something very bad when I went to watch it. Maybe it was partly due to the fact that my expectations had been lowered, but I actually quite enjoyed the show.The plot deviated a bit from the book - the main difference was actually the existence of a plot - but most of it remained loyal to Douglas Adams' original masterpiece. True, some jokes did not make it to screen, among them some of my favourites from the novel, but the movie made up for it with new jokes more suited to the film medium. In my opinion, the humour in the movie lay not so much in the jokes themselves, which admittedly weren't always very good, but more in the overall whacked-out craziness of the storyline and universe.Those who have not yet read the books, however, might not 'get' most of the movie, because it relies quite a bit on the audience having at least a vague idea of what is happening in order to keep track of the story. There are also a few in-jokes around that only fans would understand, so it would probably be a good idea to read the book before watching the show.One of the things I didn't like in the show was the sudden addition of the love-triangle subplot, because it did not seem to fit in with the original spirit of the book - but I'm generally a person who doesn't like romance movies much, so perhaps my opinion here might be slightly biased.Overall, the movie was a fun ride that went beyond my expectations. The cast was great and brought the characters to life, the music was great - singing dolphins; what more could you ask for? - and the script was a nice adaptation of print to screen. It could have been better, but it still remains a worthy addition to the Hitchhiker's franchise.Seven stars.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
798,SealMan87,"Great Movie, True Fans Should Enjoy",10,12 May 2005,"In my opinion, and in the spirit of Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, this really is an excellent movie. It was well acted, with great casting choices (this is about the most subjective thing about the whole movie, but I think the cast was great). It also has great special effects and visuals and such. It's certainly a breath of fresh air, so to speak, to see unusual people/creatures/aliens/etc. portrayed not with digital animation, but with highly detailed puppets that look almost real. The movie is just as funny as the book, and I think that the different interpretation when it comes to certain things (Zaphod Beeblebrox, for instance) is well done and actually interesting. Even people who haven't read the books should enjoy this movie.I'd also like to address the reviews of the movie that say that it is bad because it didn't follow the books and so many things are different. I knew that Douglas Adams had said it before, but I read an actual interview about this movie from back in 1999 (while he was trying to get the movie started) that is from the book ""The Salmon of Doubt"" by Douglas Adams. He specifically states, about the movie: ""Whenever I sit down and do another version of Hitchhiker, it highly contradicts whatever version went before. The best thing I can say about the movie is that it will be specifically contradicting the first book."" Based on this, I think that any true fan of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy and Douglas Adams should appreciate the movie, because despite what everyone says, the movie is how Douglas Adams wanted it to be, and it should not be that difficult to enjoy. This really is a great movie, and I recommend that anyone who has read the books (or even has not) and hasn't seen the movie go see it at least once and develop your own opinion about it, but keep in mind what Douglas Adams himself said about it, and maybe you'll understand it a little better.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
799,Packie,"I should warn you all, that I'm very depressed.",3,29 March 2007,"I'm a huge fan of the ""Hitchhiker's"" series of books. I didn't like the English TV series at all, and have long been waiting for the day that someone could take modern day special effects and use them to bring Douglas Adams' witty brainchildren to life.Well, they used the effects part anyway.I avoided this film based on the horrible reviews from the critics, as well as warnings from friends of mine who are also fans of the books. I finally caught it on cable, and, as promised, I was disappointed. I was also watching with someone who had never read the books and he just didn't get the film at all.And therein lies the rub: Douglas Adams' writing is so simultaneously cerebral, witty and glib that it's nearly impossible to translate into the spoken word. I mean, how do you effectively translate the sheer humor of the entire Babel Fish concept into a speech, better yet a scene in a movie? Answer: you can't... it's meant to be read.I suppose a better script might have been borne out of simply chopping most of Adams' witticisms and high-brow concepts, and sticking to the basic ""Hitchhiker's"" story. That said, even if they had done this, I doubt they filmmakers could have come up with anything better than this loud, chaotic mess of film.Bad casting choices just help compound the problem. I couldn't tolerate Sam Rockwell as Zaphod (WAY too frenetic and not nearly charming enough) and Mos Def as Ford (less a character and more a mouthpiece for one one-liner after another.) And as much as I like her as an actress, I felt Zooey Dechanel was too light and sweet as Trillian.

Painful to listen to, and crushing on the fragile little soul.The film was agony. Ten minutes in and I was longing to hyperspace it out of there but sheer hope that it would improve rooted me to the spot.I have been a hardcore fan of Hitchhiker's ever since I first heard the BBC's radio play where talented actors such as Peter Jones brought the dazzling script to life. These actors took time over the words, adapting the perfect tone and manner that really allowed Douglas Adam's genius to shine through. However, last night I sat, frozen to my seat and cringing at the God-awful acting and the horror that was the delivery of the script. I was even more shocked that they dared to not only include Douglas Adam's name in the script writing credits, but they also tried to make up their own little feeble jokes. The people that hadn't read the books tittered away while the rest of us cringed, knowing that Adam's great wit had been lost in the great vacuum of space.Furthermore, how dare they so drastically change the plot when a beautiful one was all set out for them? Little was explained by way of the reasoning behind the character's habits of clinging to towels or the fact that the Babel Fish was the possible final clinching argument for the non-existence of God. The only credit I could give was that Stephen Fry was well cast as ""The Book"". But even his words were lost as there were so many confusing visual images happening on screen that there was no time to concentrate on the genius humor of Mr. Adams's commentary.The film makers also did not even seem to understand the reasoning behind The Restaurant at the End of the Universe. ""Er, the end of the universe is the other way,"" drones the soul destroying morbid tones of Marvin the Paranoid Android, voiced by an actor with already one of the worst voices in film, Alan Rickman. Er, no, you daft robot, we are talking about the end as in will be happening, has happened, has been going to have happened. Not the end of the universe that is a few yards away where all the stars and crap stop. God.I do apologize for the rant, but that excuse of a film has brought shame upon the good name of Hitchhiker's. My only hope is that its poor ratings force it to leave the big screen quickly before that terrible ""So long, and thanks for all the fish"" song becomes a number one hit.

The mechanism for Zaphod's two heads was actually done worse than the original TV series, and the romance between Arthur & Trillian consumed most of the latter two-thirds of the movie. The BBC review which said that they fundamentally forgot that HHGTTG is meant to be funny is spot-on.While good performances were given by several of the actors, and Alan Rickman made Marvin entirely believable, the lack of coherence with the book will leave real fans entirely disappointed. Even non fans will find the movie fizzles out after the first half and the cinema where I watched this was almost entirely silent for the last half hour of the movie.Instead of watching this you'd be far better off sitting down with a nice cup of tea and reading the books again.

I have no experience with the TV/radio series what so ever.(MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS)I went to the theater to see this movie with my dad and two of my friends. I had somewhat mixed expectations towards it because from what I had seen in the trailers and so on didn't exactly give me the impression that they had focused on what I appreciate in the books. Already from the start, me and the movie didn't get along well, since i wasn't very happy with neither the introduction nor the dolphin song. ""So long and thanks for all the fish"" is one of my all time favorite quotes, and I think it was delivered very poorly, partly by focusing too much on it by putting it right in the beginning, and presenting it in a way that might as well have said something like ""what they really said was, and this is the punch line, you might as well start laughing right now, check out how funny this is: so long and thanks for all the fish"". Needless to say, I didn't like the song either, it just focused even more on the quote, almost wearing it out before it is even delivered. I felt this way about most of the good quotes.I felt the casting was decent. ""With a better script, I think they could have done a very well job. In fact Alan Rickman as Marvin was the perfect casting in my opinion, as it was pretty much exactly what I imagined his voice like when I read the books.The plot deviated a bit from the book, but I didn't mind that much. I did, however mind that every scene achieved to feel a bit pointless up until the meeting with Slartibarfast (which I DID like). I think the movie should be longer, as it felt very rushed. The few times I appreciated a scene, the movie moved on to something completely different, making me forget about the scene almost before it was over.For a movie that is supposed to be funny, I don't think that making me smile 2 or 3 times in total is a very good result. It was even more incohersive than the book, and way less interesting. The only response that came from the audience was a solitary chuckle a few times. I discussed these things with the others whom I watched it with (2 out of 3 having read the book) and they agreed with everything I said. I am usually not very critical about movies, and there are very few that I thing are downright poor, but this, I'm sorry to say, is one of them.

804,rima_marie_a,...,10,30 April 2005,"I agree that the movie was not completely true to the books.However, it must also be said that the books were not completely true to the radio series.Also, a movie needs to include different things than a book does, especially one with no plot.And, as great as the book was, it did not have a plot with any direction.More, it addressed our questions to life, the universe, and everything, and, more specifically, how they could not be answered. It actually made fun of us all. We wonder, what is the meaning of life, the answer to life? But how does that relate? In the most literal sense, life is not a question. (Oh, shoot, now I'll have people snipping at me that yes, it is. Please take note of the word literal.) It also questions how people's minds think, as with the whale (even though it IS a whale, rather than a human) and (although this might be from a different book in the series; I can't quite get them straight) the planet on which the phone cleaners and such land their spaceship after being sent off their own planet where they were considered useless.It also questions our idea of a government (with the Volgons). This did remind me somewhat of Monty Python, in both the books and the movie of The Hitchhiker's Guide, and it is still very funny.It also toys with the idea that we are not the most important being in the universe, that we are only here so that others could find out the question to an answer (yes, that was not a typo; question to an answer).The movie, in a subtle way rather similar to that of the book, does address these ""issues,"" and with the same humor required to keep the audience laughing, even when they do not fully understand the joke.Now, my only valid complaints are (in no particular order) that:1) The improbability drive was never explained. (And it could have been, easily. They'd already thought up the guide.)2) Zaphod's heads were not side by side. (A trivial factor, but you don't get his whole personality the entire time.) 3) There was the big romance between Arthur and Trillian (not explored in the book and downright cheesy, although some of this is made up for in the scene with the mice).4) There was an ending. (In the world of ""should not""s, if there is one, this is the biggest of them all. There SHOULD NOT have been that everything's-fixed ending, or an ending to the story in the first place.)Okay, I have to admit, they aren't such valid complaints. For number one, it wasn't completely necessary but would have been nice, and could have been one of the Guide entries.For number two, well, it really isn't that big of a deal, as annoyed as it might make me.As to number three, I guess it was included to give the film more direction.Number four, it IS a movie, so I guess it has to have an ending, doesn't it? Or else it wouldn't satisfy too many people, especially since people would be left with the idea that there was no home left at the end of the movie.But overall, it was a VERY good movie, and almost every single audience member in the theater, including myself, was clapping at the end of the movie.

Yes, it didn't follow the book, but that in and of itself doesn't bother me, it simply was an awful movie. It was uninteresting, long silences meant perhaps to be pensive or emotional come off as uncomfortable, half way through the movie i was begging for it to end.Aside from failing to be at all suspenseful in any way, there were holes in the story large enough to drive a truck through! Like what was the deal with Zaphod and the Captain lady of the Vogon fleet? It was unexplained and unconvincing, and by the end of the movie i was just annoyed and confused. Speaking of unconvincing, was there any chemistry between Arthur and Trillian? I'm leaning toward it being bad writing more so than bad acting, but either way it was unbelievable and uncomfortable.So basically i thought that it was one of the worst major production movies i have ever seen in my life.

806,wjb67,incredible disappointment,1,4 May 2005,"Before I make any claims let me explain that I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE the works of Douglas Adams. I read Hitchhiker's Guide (et al) for the first time when I was 14 (roughly 1982)...and watched the BBC TV series soon after, and loved that too...and eventually I heard the radio series on tape (and later CD). And I am not disappointed because some things were changed...I am used to the ever shifting plot lines going from radio play to book to TV series. I will say that the film had ever so much potential thanks to the amazing special effects. I have to admit that the Vogons looked great. I had great hopes for this film...and each and every one of them was dashed and blown to bits...and those bit were stomped into a million tinier bits. But let's be serious here...The power of the book and radio play and TV series all lay in the dialog...and the delivery thereof. Not one...not ONE SINGLE gag revived from the originals was delivered with anything even approaching comic timing. I was utterly appalled at this. I mean, come on...Mos Def? His ""interpretation"" (such as it is) of Ford Prefect was turgid and humorless. The character of Arthur Dent, being the absolute CENTER of the piece, was entirely stunted! You cannot play Hitchhiker's guide with a central character that wavers between sniveling loser, and romantic lead! It's not on! Zaphod was an abortion...the actor playing him should be hung. I know it's a comic character...but that performance had the range of a daisy air rifle (to borrow a Dennis Miller line). I'd be happy to throw the gallows switch and hang them all!!! And how about resolving one or two (or twelve or fifteen) plot lines before swooping in with the stupifyingly cliché ending? And what the HELL was the Malkovich diversion about? I could go on (and on and on and on) but you get the picture. I really don't want to be a hater here...but I now understand why Star Wars geeks hate George Lucas. At least Adams has an excuse...he's DEAD. And spinning around and around and around and around....Shenanigans I say!!",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
807,philippwilde,I loved the book as much as I hated the movie!!!,1,12 June 2005,"*contains only minor spoilers, much like the trailer* Just 3 weeks ago, I read the book for the 3rd time together with the following two. Like the 1st and 2nd time I caught myself laughing my ass of at least twice per page. In my opinion Douglas Adams has just written an incredibly funny book. Unbelievable that he has also written the screen play for this movie, because, in my opinion, it really sucks! I am sorry, but that is exactly what I was thinking while watching it. Besides things like: why am I still sitting here I? Why is my friend beside me fast asleep (by the way a funny guy with a good humor)? Why are so many people laughing? I did not have very high expectations; nevertheless I have been utterly disappointed. Some people compared this film with pieces from Monty Python  a blasphemy! OK, they are all supposed to be funny (Hitchhiker isn't) and very cranky. Only the jokes directly taken from the book do their job, if they are not totally goofed by the bad acting. Sorry but I have expected a lot more. In my opinion, the only good character is Arthur Dent, the worst is Zaphod. His 2 heads? Come on, it cannot have been meant like that. There probably was no budget for other, better solutions. It seems that they invested all their money in the Vorgons and their space ships together with the explosion of earth, which where really not bad up to the point where they were thrown out of the ship. Back to Zaphod: in the book he is described as ""the hell of a guy he is"". He isn't in this movie. Trying to be funny, but obviously failing at it. The manic depressive robot Marvin also is not nearly as funny as he is in the book (ok, you could say this for almost everything (sorry, cancel ""almost"") ). They left out the best jokes concerning Marvin. Why? It would have been an easy job with this character. Concerning the plot, I cannot understand why they changed it so much. I would say about 50%. And not for good! The book is not really suited for a movie adaptation, I admit that, but the changes in the plot do not really help it. And that is why I cannot understand why they almost totally changed it. The only positive thing I have to say about this movie is this: I liked the parts where they cited from the original Hichthiker's guide and the implementation of this electronic book. These quotations did their job as they were taken word by word from the book. Other than that I was extremely disappointed by this movie without the esprit, the atmosphere and the fun of the book and also by Douglas Adams (bless him) as he had his fingers in this Go watch it and judge for yourself if you like. If you have not read the book, READ IT!!! Even if you hated the movie, it is worth it as it is totally different!  so long, and thanks for the fish!",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
808,Hoopsta,Very Disappointing,3,4 May 2005,"I had high hopes for this movie having read the book and the film having received largely positive reviews in the British press.Good PointsThe effects were quite impressive. - Stephen Fry's interludes where he narrates parts of the Hitchhikers Guide were the most amusing parts.Bad PointsThe pacing of the film was terrible with parts where it was moving too fast to comprehend what was happening, to others where I was extremely bored and contemplating walking out of the movie.The characters had no depth and I didn't develop any feeling towards them at all.A very convoluted story which brushed over or dispensed with significant parts in the book far too often for seemingly little gain.Apart from the narrations from the HHGG the humour in the film seemed almost nonexistent. A mouse saying 'bollocks' got the biggest laugh in the cinema I was in, which says it all really. Not the sort of humour the author of the book was aiming at I would have thought.OverallA big disappointment, I had expected so much more (but should, perhaps, have known better).",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
809,mchalk-1,Who is the singer on the track that goes ''Goodbye and Thanks For All The Fish''??,10,4 May 2005,"Brilliant song, great voice - anyone know where I can download it? I noticed that the composer was Joby Talbot but I doubt he is the one singing - I recognize the voice but just can't pin it down. Still this is a film of great voices I got Alan Rickman and I got Bill Bailey but there were loads I missed hope someone can help me with this.....Think I heard the voice on more than one song as well. But it is the swinging 'Cabaret' of ''Goodbye and Thanks For All The Fish'' that I like. Great animations. I was thrilled by this movie. I love old Douglas Adams, I think he was a little bit Marvin and a little bit Arthur but wanted to be. He was all his characters. I suppose for posterity's sake, and since he had to die in his forties, he should have made it 42 rather 49 - some artists don't know the meaning of sacrifice. Or maybe things are as they were meant to be and perhaps his final thought was ''Wow, I was out by seven years''......",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
810,lestereheli,A Good Movie on its Own,8,5 May 2005,"Now, having been excited about this movie since I heard it was coming out, I have been steadily reading the reviews, and will adhere to their basic format: PART 1: DISPLAY OF LEGITIMACY OF ADAMS' WORK: This is the art where someone says something like ""I heard the original radio broadcasts, read all the books, watched the filming of the BBC series and tapped Douglas Adams phone so I could know exactly what his intentions were for this film."" Well, I'm not quite that kind of fan. I have read the Hitchhiker's series, and thoroughly enjoyed the books. However, I don't believe this actually plays any role in how I enjoy the movie. PART 2: CONNECTION OF ORIGINAL MATERIAL TO THE MOVIE: This is where the person disputes everything different the movie did when compared to the book, radio series, bbc series, computer game and breakfast cereal. I did have images in my own head about who should be what in what way, but I'm not in charge of casting. But, what does it come down to? Well, the characters make a good story. Changing Ford Prefect (Mos Def) to not being British emphasizes Prefect's lack of familiarity with Earth. The image of him riding a shopping cart full of beer made me crack up. And that is why I enjoyed the film, because the movie captured the spirit of the characters and story, though it did not capture the exact behavior and dialogue of the book. And really, I think this made it into a more streamlined story. The Vogon Planet voyage was added in because it supported the idea of Vogons being bureaucratic more than the book ever did. The love story (here I walk upon a mine field) made Trillian have a lot more depth than just Arthur's unremarkable failure and Zaphod's toy he hardly pays attention to. The love story drove the story to actually compel Arthur to do more than whine about tea. Further additions, including Humma Kavula, I think just make a more solid story. Plus, enough was added form the other books to make it a more consistent universe; for example, Ford used ""Belgium"" as an expletive, which didn't come up until the third book (maybe because it was such a naughty word?). PART 3: FURTHER LAMENTING AND DESIRE FOR SELF INJURY Here is where fans of the series regret ever having seen the movie, and Mr Adams' untimely demise, or perhaps reflecting a sense of regret in their own lives onto the production of a movie that wasn't exactly what they wanted. Often this part ends with a threat to do something really drastic to one's self. Well, i can't do that. It's just a good movie. It's funny (which is a subjective point to make, really), it's pretty and it improves upon a good concept to make it a good film. Plus, I was impressed by the fact that the movie didn't rely solely on CGI. The Vogons were puppets (or maybe real Vogons?), the ""ball of yarn"" Heart of Gold transformation was done in what looks like stop-motion animation. I think praise is due to the production team for not simply relying on graphics, though graphics are appropriate when used in moderation (such as this film). So, if you haven't seen it and don't know the series, I recommend it. If you are familiar with the series, you should still go see it, because it's the same fun ride, just made to fit the requirements of making a good movie. Thank Zarquon!",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
811,starritt-1,So so at best,5,3 May 2005,"My first exposure to the Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy came in its original form - on the Radio. Douglas Adam's came up with the idea while he was lying drunk in a field in Innsbruck and but a short time later adults and children alike got used to tuning into BBC Radio 4 to listen to another episode. Of course this was the late 70s and I was terribly young but it was popular enough for repeats.Then came the books. The popularity of the Radio Show and the books could only mean one thing - low budget TV shows and all of a sudden I got to see Zaphord, Ford and Arthur in a series that made Doctor Who look look high budget.Then more books came - they complete the Trilogy of five parts. They where read in my teens, re-read in my early 20s and last year I went through all five yet again. The Hitchhikers guide has pretty well been in the background of my live for the last twenty eight years and then came the movie  I was fearful that somehow they would botch the film. Seeing Douglas Adams' name on the screenplay re-assured me - it was going to use the same scripting as the Radio and TV shows and basically it did. Martin Freeman (The Office - um the good British version) was marvelously cast as Arthur - in fact the casting for Zaphod and Ford (Mos Def) was also good however the best their combined talents could muster was a mildly entertaining semi-romp that left me dissatisfied.The problem is that the Hitchhikers Guide never really got going in book one, it took a while to pick up - for Arthur to find his feet (and learn that he didn't need them). The original book jumped around the place - its format based upon the 30 minute radio shows and in essence what you get in the film adaptation of a radio show is a series of sketches punctuated with animated clippings from the Guide. I could not help whispering ""And now for something completely different"" the second or third time this happened. The Pythonesq tendencies of Adams lost whatever freshness they had in this latest translation and while their are funny parts the random nature of the books have resulted in a somewhat disjointed and forgettable film.Marvin, voiced by the superb Alan Rickman was just disappointing, and I thought the Trillian actress Zooey Deschanel was astoundingly dull.I wonder if this is the same for people who are unfamiliar with the books and radio shows? The box office figures at a glance appear to be healthy however the US Box office is on an almost record breaking run of seven or eight weeks of continual decline and with the offerings available at the moment its no surprise. Hitchhikers is top of the pile mearly because it already has a following  Yeah there where some funny bits, Bill Nighy (Underworld, Shaun of the Dead) was spot on as Slartibartfast as well but all in all its a loser - faithful but lacking life. Maybe some things are just not designed to be compressed into 110 minutes.If they do carry on the series and make The Restaurant at the end of the Universe things may improve - but I say that without much hope, it'd merely be a reflection of a book better than the prior one and it'd be without Douglas Adam's work on the movie scripting.If you want a good quality Sci Fi spoof watch Galaxy Quest instead, it achieves everywhere ""Guide"" fails and its funny as hell.Bested by a Tim Allen movie  I think that says it all.As a side BBC Radio 4 has adapted the final three books to Radio (they actually where books to begin with). Life, The Universe And Everything; So Long And Thanks For All The Fish and Mostly Harmless (after which this blog was originally named) will be available at 5pm Central US Time via the Radio 4 website - if you have broadband and are a Hitchhikers fan you may well enjoy what you hear. If you can't manage to listen to the live broadcasts, I believe you can still get the content via the site.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
812,julieharvell,A shoot.....and a miss,1,20 May 2005,"Unfortunately, it is painfully obvious that Douglass Adams died during the making of this visually stunning-but plot deficient film. Ford was severely lacking in Charisma and charm, and it is never a good idea to put multiple books all in one film. As this film proves, this usually produces a disjointing, confusing films that is especially unfriendly to others (like my husband) who have not read the books.Also, too many characters and aspects of the film went unexplained, for example the depressed Robot and the Vice President (??) were especially strained and forced. The sighing doors sounded a little disturbing as well.All in all, a disappointment.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

OK, I've never really passed comment on a movie before but I have literally just walked out of h2g2 and wow. I thought it was amazing! Now, I only finished the book the other day, so I'm kinda new to the world of Adams, and after reading a few reviews I was a bit apprehensive of the film. Martin Freeman, can he be anything but Tim from The Office? YES!! Now there is a bit of Tim in him, or course, but it perfectly comes through as Arthur Dent. He really plays it well, his kinda lost expression through out the film was great! erm, other things about the film... The bits that aren't in the book pad the story out well, its understandable that the book may need a little extra stuffing to fill the time.. The love story(!) now did i miss reading that part of the book, or was that brought in to help girls get into it more!!? Still, I guess it was in the book, just not in such a big way! Woah the deputy Galactic President woman really looks like Davina McCall! on a similar note, I am sure Trillian will be a pin up on the walls of all h2g2 fans! she is lovely!! spooky large sexy eyes too.. yum, erm, yeah.. also very good at her part! Loved the fact they managed to get the word b*ll*cks in there!

I wouldn't watch the shows as that may spoil it a bit, i dunno! The TV shows are on this weekend, am looking forward to seeing them!another point... stay to the end of the credits!!! always a must when seeing movies!! funny little bit near the end, especially if you know the book..

She probably wouldn't have chosen to see the film if it hadn't been my choice. However, she admitted enjoying the movie as well.I thought that the casting was excellent.

815,pez_and_vinegar,May my eyes and ears never again be troubled by this bastardization.,2,7 May 2005,"I must say, this film adaptation of perhaps the greatest science-fiction series ever was quite a disappointment. The first ten minutes of this movie resembled something that was almost, but not quite, entirely unlike tHHGttG that I was expecting.What happened to the dialog between Prosser and Arthur about the demolition order that was supposedly on display? A hilarious recollection from Arthur regarding the hiding place of the document was replaced by a single sentence: it was in the basement.And I believe I read on this very site that the character played by John Malkovich (pardon me for forgetting the character's name. He just seemed very unimportant.) was written by Mr. Adams himself specifically for Malkovich. Why is this, I wonder. His appearance in the film seemed superfluous, as did many of the events that transpired. Trillian's capture? Unnecessary. Just an excuse for a cameo appearance by the original Marvin.The entire film seemed...unedited. It leads me to wonder if Douglas Adams intended it to come to this, or if he was planning to smooth out the rough edges before he kicked it old-school to the ill beats of the boom-box beyond. It is my assumption that this was his plan, and that the screenplay was left unmolested out of respect, when, in reality, leaving the story in such shambles was on the same level of respect as, say, raping his corpse.I'm not going to bring up the continuity errors or the mistakes in the who-gets-the-girl game, as I am tired, and plan to dream of a quality HHGttG movie in just a moment.Bottom line: If you feel the need to watch the story rather than read it, skip this ungodly abomination and pop in the BBC miniseries.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

817,houndour30,Utterly Enjoyable!,9,28 April 2005,"I've just gotten back from the movie. It was surprisingly good, considering my thoughts on Hollywood and them butchering good books. Everything that was a vital plot point (if you can say the The Guide has a plot) was in the movie. The FX in the movie was really good and Zaphod did have a second head and third arm in the movie, which was cause for much debate over the last few months before it screened because there were many rumors that Hollywood was going to scrap the idea until Adams son stepped in and said that Zaphod wouldn't be Zaphod with out his extra body parts and they got Zaphods character down to a 'T'. They even (through out the movie) made the automatic doors in the Heart Of Gold, sigh when they opened and closed which is a minor thing but still in the books.I hope there going to do a sequel. There was reference at the end of the film to The Restaurant at the End of the Universe which is the second book in the trilogy in five parts. Alan Rickman was the best choice for the voice of Marvin. I really enjoyed him in Harry Potter (SeverusSnape) he really brought the character to life. Arthur was your basic British man who just wanted a cup of tea and was going along with the whole thing because he really couldn't understand what was happening..that and because he was thirsty. Martin Freeman was a good choice of actor for the part, he played poor confused Arthur quite well. I haven't seen many of Zooey Deschanel, (dark eyed, dark haired) who played Trillian, I know she was in The New Guy, Almost Famous and Elf but I have yet to see any of those movies but her character was portray well enough. She quite a stretch from the blue eyed blonde from the TV series. Anna Chancellor who played Questular Rontok played Diane in Tipping the Velvet, a really good film I enjoyed..plus she's good looking..always a plus. Much like Sharon Stone who at 40 is very good looking. She was also in Pride and Prejudice, What a Girl Wants and Agent Cody Banks: 2. Bill Nighy played Slartibartfast. He was excellent as Viktor in Underworld and the new Underworld: Evolution which is in production. He also played in the 1989 version of ""The Phantom of the Opera"" Although you really need to read the books to understand this movie, my partner really enjoyed the movie, even though she has never read the books..yet..",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

It started going wrong when Ford turned up with a shopping cart of beer and the foreman in charge of the demolition of Arthur's house did not agree to lay down in front of the bulldozer. Zaphod and Ford, not being nonchalant when the met, personalities having changed completely. Zaphod having two faces instead of two heads, the point of view gun. It finally fell completely on it's face when the Magratheans recreated earth, finishing it off with the recreation of people with all their life experience right up to the minute before destruction. Ridiculous as the earth was the greatest computer ever built and it would have taken something even greater to record it all and recreate it.. Whereas in the book Ford and Arthur were stranded on a primordial earth and The Question to which the answer is 42 was extracted from a primitive hominid using a scrabble set Arthur had made to stop boredom.The one highlight of the film was the cameo from Marvin in the office on Vogsphere.It should have kept to the story as told in the book.

The bureaucracy of the Vogons went down particularly well. I was disappointed by certain aspects such as the love story between Arthur Dent and Trillian. It's not because it made the story soppy or anything, it's just that if they intend to continue on and make films of the rest of the trilogy of 5 they are going to have to re-mould the story line around this.

821,JulianDelphiki,Summary of a huge fan waiting for the movie for a long time.,6,22 June 2005,"Hitchhiker's movie reviewThe hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy is a marvelous book, and is not dimmed at all by the movie. I didn't think the movie was great though. One of the problems is that part of Douglas' genius is in the way he says things. He really is very clever. When he was writing a book, he used to say he was trying to put a hundred thousand words in cunning order. That part is impossible to convey into a movie. That said, they could have done better. Adams made some changes in his version of the script, but I expect that they either did them wrong in the movie or made some changes by the last edition of the script. Some of the changes were tolerable, such as Humma Kavula and his ""Don't vote for stupid"" campaign. But many of the changes changed the whole way that the book felt. plot revealers belowYes, in the book, the earth was almost done and it wouldn't have been much effort to put it back but it wasn't, because the whole feel of the book is nihilism. Another change is the fact that the ""share and enjoy"" nutrimatic machine is actually capable of giving you what you desire. What it actually does in the book is detects what you want and what would be nutritiously good for you, but no one knows quite why it does that because it instead puts out the exact same tasteless morsel regardless. Another change was the love story between Arthur and Trillian, which had a few good points, such as the party, but overall was a waste of time. Another change was the deep thought watching TV? and zaphod powered by lemons? OK, that wasn't worth it. plot revealers overin other words, I can't see how anyone who hasn't read the book could enjoy it, except for small fragments.However, if you are a big fan of the book, like for instance, me. Some things are neat. Such as, the ways that the characters and certain events were done. I liked the way they did the first infinite improbability drive with ford and Arthur. or the way they did slartibartfast, etc. and who can complain about the special effects?so, my final rating, out of 10, is a 6.0 they could have done a heck of a lot better, but there was some of it that was worth it, though not enough. I had hoped that the movie would draw some of the, shall I say, ahem, less literary, to the book, but it seems I can't depend on it.in other words, read the book instead.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

823,dmorlan,"Neat movie, COMPLETELY changed from the book.",7,30 April 2005,"It is most difficult making a movie into a book, and I knew what I was in for when I saw that the movie wasn't even two hours long. To tell the story as it was originally incarnated would take at least five to six hours, so I arrived at the theater with no expectation of the genuine article. (Incidentally, it was opening day for a brand new theater! Nice facility, I don't mind saying! But I digress...) I wasn't disappointed, really, because my expectations were very low...In it's own right, the movie is good. Acting is fine, and the casting is good. (My greatest criticism of the casting was giving the role of Ford Prefect to Mos Def. I thought that this was a ridiculous choice, and kept the movie from being an 8, or even an 8.5. A 9 if the acting were good enough. I would have rather chosen Steve Buscemi, Brent Spiner, or even Jim Carrey for a role like that.) Touchstone's single GREATEST casting achievement was choosing Sam Rockwell as Zaphod Beeblebrox. They could not have chosen a better actor. He played the part masterfully, and this stood out to me as one of the greatest casting endeavors ever accomplished. His performance is the reason my review is not a 5 or 6.Since I have intimate knowledge of the entire series, it was heartwarming to find some familiar faces. (Noteably Douglas Adams' likeness several places, and the man who originally played Arthur Dent on the BBC's TV and Radio series.) Do NOT expect anything to do with the book! There are some lines, but not enough, along with a few synonymous sub-plots, but if you think about it, the book really never DID have a plot! That was the magic of Douglas Adams, and the true-blue die-hard fan knows, appreciates, and loves this. It is part and parcel of Douglas's universe. To sum it up, I would say that this movie is a whole separate entity lightly flavored with the true and genuine spirit of Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. It might have been how Douglas would have wanted it, but it's not what is wanted, in my educated opinion, of anyone who is a deep, devoted fan of the original work, having high expectations of an ultimately similar experience.I'd pay $50.00 to see most of the same actors do something much more faithful to at least the BBC's radio series, and sit for six hours. I'll add this to my repertoire when it is released on DVD, but I do not consider this a synonymous work to the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy at all.You've been given an honest, well-thought review.Daniel",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
824,Shutter_Stop,I've been talking to the ship's computer....,10,1 May 2005,"And It absolutely loves this film. As a fanatic of the books and radio series, I am completely and totally happy about how this movie turned out. It keeps points from the original books and radio series while maintaining its own identity, which I feel keeps very much in the vein of Douglas Adams vision.The movie begins with an awesome sequence about dolphins. Yes. Dolphins. From this point on I knew that everything about this was going to be perfect. My friend nearly slapped me when the original theme music began playing the first time you see the guide. The little inclusions made me squirm happily(such as the original Marvin the Paranoid Android and the music) and the new stuff makes me proud to be a Hiker in all the sense of the fandom.The characters were played very well by all the actors. I was a bit hesitant about Mos Def being Ford, but he played the character very well. He definitely accents Ford's personality and plays him just like I thought he was in the books. Sam Rockwell was brilliant as Zaphod, well both heads of Zaphod. HE did really well in the role and I believe that if they make the other movies they should keep him on board. I was pleasantly surprised by Zooey Deschanel's performance of Trillian. Trillian is by no means a simple character, as she is intelligent, annoying, slightly self-centered and very eccentric. But, all things considered, she did a very good job of playing her character.Now to my two most favorite characters, Arthur and Marvin. Martin Freeman did an excellent job of playing our bumbling hero. He makes you feel sorry for him and love him all at the same time. Finally, Alan Rickman is now my god. Marvin would not be Marvin without him now! There is one goof that I noticed in this movie. In the background of the final scene, where Slarti is asking Arthur if he wants to stay on Earth, you can see a white truck pass the screen in the background. IT's too soon to see the newly depressed Vogons,so it has to be one of those fluke things.I believe that Douglas Adams, were he still here, would be very proud of this creation.

Saying that and the fact good IL' DA was heavily involved (screeplay and what not), I still have to say that I was a little let down. Don't get me wrong, I loved it, but still was a little disappointed. At only 2 hrs I felt it would have been pulled off better at 3 and would not have to have changed much of it. Another thing, I always picture Zaphod as sorta a footloose, go with the flow kina guy. Why would his agenda be to find out the ultimate question? Overall I still feel they stuck to the tradition of HHGG. I would have to say its a pretty Frood Flick....!! Now how do we get the Milliway's from here, and we better!!!!!!!

829,Survurus3,"A Visual, Funny, and Brilliant Amusement Ride!",9,1 May 2005,"Not having previously read Adams' books plus having no familiarity with the other original material, I hugely enjoyed this film from beginning to end. Aside from the wonderful special/visual effects, the story held an air of humor that successfully kept the plot interesting and question-filled (which could be the number one most important aspect to have in a successful film). I would also like to point out that there are some parts scattered throughout this film that make the average human question the existence of said universe. Though I will not mention any of them just for the sake of keeping this comment free of spoilers, I will at least mention this so film-viewers can appreciate the brilliance of this intriguing view on our existence. I strongly recommend this film to anyone wishing to end their week on a sun-setting Friday night with 110 minutes of an adventure through all of the fascinating marvels of the universe.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
830,internetaddress,The Books are better,4,14 August 2005,"If you have read the book then you will be disappointed. The film was fairly well made and quite entertaining but was changed from the book to an unnecessarily great extent. Forget the book and it will be entertaining, if you have nothing better to do. If you cannot forget the book then you are bound to be disappointed and wonder why they had to change it so much. If you haven't read the book, see the film first, enjoy it and then read the book for a much more entertaining story. The first half of the film is relatively true Douglas Adams's original and as such are much better. The second half strays and deteriorates. On the whole i thought that the roles were well cast, with Arthur and 'the guide' being spot on. Ford was a disappointment. He was clearly not American in the book and, whilst I have no problems with Americans(wouldn't want to offend anyone!), i felt that it did detract from the film to have someone so American playing him.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

Funny - not uproariously, belly aching but the witty sarcasm/genius that was in the books anyway. Not exactly the same plot admittedly but changes have to be made for a film, what do you expect? I enjoyed it, had some of the best ideas/comments/jokes and some new ones crammed into 1 hour 40 min. So stop your bashing this is a good film, and many many times better than other films I've seen on this site with an average rating of 6.9. It keeps going down and I don't see why. Good film. See it.

833,speccy4i,They pulled it off folks!,9,30 April 2005,"This film has been in development hell longer than I've been alive so you can imagine I felt something I've never felt when going to see a movie.I was nervous.I had read most of the reviews, I had posted my opinions on these message boards so this was it, my reputation on the line and I have to say that I am satisfied.First of all, this is not a literal translation, this is Hitchhikers reborn, seen through the eyes of somebody else and it is very refreshing.Martin Freeman is likable, he has this charm that you really do feel sorry for him, he's lost his planet and the woman of his dreams is in the arms of Zaphod and there is tension between the two that you would expect.Mos Def is a great Ford, a character he has made his own with a twist of almost being Arturs mother, really wanting to take care of Arthur. Ford is toned down but you get more of a sense of him taking it all in his stride.Zooey Deschanel is wonderfully sweet whilst still being this independent woman, this is someone you really could fall for but she has this integrity that makes her one of the strongest characters.Sam Rockwell is just phenomenal as Zaphod, playing it so slimingly charming and yet so stupid it does make you laugh.Hummala is a bit of a wasted character, I can see his potential which hopefully will be resolved in sequels but it does seem to be a stop gap to lengthen the plot.The visuals are amazing, the guys who made it (Hammer and Tongs) really get the concept and have fun with it. I would go as far to say that Garth Jennings is a gifted with visuals as Douglas was with words so He's perfect for the job.The Guide entries are woven into the story well and don't slow the story down, generally used to just give a few bits of information needed for the plot whilst still retaining the humour that makes itself a character in the movie. There are moments in the film where they aren't spoon-feeding you the information you need to know and I thought it was great, actually letting you think about the story.The love story is great, causing a great amount of drive for Arthur and Trillian the makes you care for the characters.On the whole, I'd say it's a great movie. If this is it then the ending lets it down but if the movies are continued then this will be the beginning to a hopefully great series.Just keep in mind that this isn't the book, it's a movie and so the plot had to change to fit the medium.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
834,akoynov,Absolutely follows the spirit of the books.,10,1 May 2005,"Before seeing the movie, I was quite concerned with all the ""doom and gloom"" warnings about it straying from both the word and the spirit of the source material. After seeing it, I can say with relief that it absolutely follows the spirit of the books. As for the plot...it does deviate from both the books and the radio plays, but not in a bad way. I feel that I must issue one warning, however. Just as in the case of another famous literary work turned into a movie, i.e. ""The Lord of the Rings"", this movie will appeal mostly to people who have read and liked the books...others might feel a bit lost and will certainly not get many of the ""inside jokes"" saturating the movie.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

836,rimach,Very Good - Just short of excellent,8,29 April 2005,"They did a wonderful job of capturing Adams' mood and feel. The pace is a bit brisk. Those not familiar with the stories (i.e., not nearly- fanatical fans such as I) might have a hard time keeping up. Some of the classic lines are spoken very softly. I think it would benefit from a slightly slower pace, but then they did cram a lot of the story into the movie. There was new material. If story purists object to that, then they don't understand Douglas Adams. The new stuff kept in the groove and added to the story. Parts were well cast. I thought that Nighy was great Slartibartfast and Deschanel was a perfect Trillian. Alan Rickman had Marvin down pat, but that shouldn't surprise anyone. All-in-all, the movie would have gotten a 10 out of me if it had slowed the pace down a tad and played down the love story a bit. But then, what do I know.

837,josealbertoabreu,A movie Douglas Adams would have loved...,9,10 June 2005,"For a movie that was in ""development hell"" for twenty years, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is a refreshingly good movie.For those who read the book: It is _not_ like the book, just like the video game was not like the television series, which was not like the record, which was not like the radio series.I hope I made myself clear... Now, to business! The movie manages to capture the spirit of Adams universe almost perfectly, the whole zany nonsensical wackiness of it, starting with the casting of Martin Freeman as the perpetually confused earthling Arthur Dent. Mos Def and Zooey Deschanel make adequate performances as Ford Prefect and Trillian, respectively, and Sam Rockwell clearly has a lot of fun bringing Zaphod Beeblebrox, explorer, adventurer, con-man, and eventually president of the galaxy, to life.Also worth mentioning are Alan Rickman as the voice of the mortally depressed Marvin the Android, and John Malkovich as religious leader/politician Humma Kavula, a character custom-made for him by Adams himself.The visual style is attractive, especially the animated sequences when the Guide is explaining something. The musical number in the beginning is funny and successful at introducing us to the overall tone of the movie and the special effects are good, though understated and subtle enough not to distract from the plot.And now, the plot... this will be the main source of complaints from the purists, as about 40% of the plot is not from the book. On its defense, let it be said that the changes were mostly made by Adams himself, and most of all, the Guide in its different incarnations (radio, book, record, TV, video game) has all had important variations.Probably my only real complaint about the movie version is Zaphod's heads and arms, here reduced to a minor plot device (head) and a one joke prop (the extra arm).Its sad that Disney would only push for development of this _after_ Adams death, since this was a proyect he worked so hard on.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

It is a very funny film which many people i know enjoyed it to because it is an all round excellent film and even if you prefer the radio or TV editions you will still enjoy this movie.

So go on touchstone, follow up this great movie with Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency.I think Ricky Gervais of the office (UK) would make a great Svlad Cjelli I also liked the nod to Long Dark Tea Time, with Deep Thought watching toons and ignoring Zaphods questions ( I guess he was lucky not to end up with a broken nose ;) The opening song, so long and thanks for all the fish, was so catchy I found myself humming it on the drive home... gotta get that soundtrack :)",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
841,intricid,It didn't let me down... that much.,9,3 May 2005,"The casting was fantastic! Mos Def somehow just kept growing on me throughout the entire film as Ford Prefect. Perhaps it's because he's not much of an actor(or perhaps he is!), that he was able to carry the over-the-top strange behavior. Martin Freeman as Arthur Dent was another great choice. Most of the side characters and behavior were very close to how I had pictured them with the exception of Trillian and Zaphod. Trillian was kind of like a totally new character. I saw Zaphod completely different in appearance, but his behavior made up for that. Marvin was still good it's just that his tone was a little more empty than I had imagined. It's too bad the movie didn't spend more time on Marvin and/or Zaphod.As for the story... completely recreating the first book would have been quite a challenge.(I'd still like to see it happen somehow though.) The condensing that took place is very understandable as they probably didn't want to make an extremely long movie hehe. Although I was disappointed at the loss of a few of my favorite parts and the substitutions that were made in their place, they did manage to keep a fast pace and the feel of the books. One of the things that I was wondering about the most was the guide itself, and I very much enjoyed the way it was handled.I actually really liked this movie. I just can't get over the fact that it was able to be transformed into a typical movie-like format and retain as much material as it did. If I made this movie, I'd want it to jump all over the place with as little continuity as possible and not have a resolution; however, I can totally see how a movie like that would never get funded, and you just don't see that kind of movie very oftenAll I know of the TV and Radio series is in the forward to The Ultimate Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.

However, this film was not very good.I've considered that perhaps I'm too hard on it considering that I had built up so much expectation but upon reflection, I think this movie was just not funny. I'm all right with them straying from the book. I was hoping it didn't completely follow the book so I wouldn't just be constantly anticipating what was going to happen or be said next. However, what I was expecting was a film in the same spirit as the book, and this film failed miserably on that end.And, where they did follow the book it's clear that whoever had the script last didn't understand where the punchlines were. This was especially noticeable during the interjections by the Guide. They would set up what was a brilliant joke, and cut it off 10 seconds before the punchline, leaving it ending on something only mildly amusing. If they had just added in all the punchlines they cut out, the film might have been about 10 minutes longer and infinitely funnier.And, whether it was Adams' idea or not, the romantic storyline was just plain bad. It took up too much time when funny stuff is supposed to be going on.They left out ""Well That About Wraps It Up For God""! That is one of the funniest bits of writing in the last 30 years and they cut it! I mean, without that joke, the babel fish is just a quirk thrown into the story with no real end. (By the way, people in the theater I was at were cracking up when the book said that the babel fish excretes conscious brainwaves... apparently the brilliant bit of comedy written about the babel fish has been reduced to a potty joke).All in all, I am really disheartened.

846,dancurry61,Where's the punchline?,3,9 May 2005,"I was VERY disappointed in this movie.Let me start by saying I thought the casting was superb. Martin Freeman is certainly everyman enough to play Arthur Dent, and Zooey Deschannel has a a girl-next-door beauty you'll fall in love with immediately. And some of the visual effects were wonderful (although the destruction of the earth was certain less stunning than I would have thought -- this might actually have been a decided choice to reflect what an insignificant event the destruction was in the grand scheme of things).My big complaint with the film is it's lack of a punchline. For those familiar with the Hitchhiker's series, the whole thing is one big joke (with a lot of little jokes thrown in along the way). But, at the end of the book, when Arthur discovers the ultimate question, and it is so out of whack, THAT'S THE PUNCHLINE. And the whole thing was just thrown away in the movie.My other complaint with the movie is that the editing STINKS. Perhaps the print my theater had was flawed, but I don't think that was the problem. Basically, there were several jumps to a snippet of conversation that was never finished. Or partial scenes thrown in and never finished. To spend such a budget on a film and then not take the time to edit it carefully just seems ridiculous.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
847,hils97,Not quite what I expected,2,9 May 2005,"I was very disappointed when I went to see this film this evening. The casting was absolutely appalling - OK, I know I'm a die-hard fan and watched it on the bbc, read all the books and even followed part of the new radio series but funnily enough, I do not recognise the characters in the film.The characterisations were weak, even when the words said were exactly the same as the TV series, the intonation was totally different - Mos Def in the pub was a completely different concept to David Dixon in the pub and started the film in a lacklustre manner.Arthur Dent was not bad, I feel he was constrained by the material and supporting actors. The heads of Zaphod were not well done and Sam Rockwell was a little too zany - what was all that about the second head??? Trillion lost something in the translation, in the book she is a dizzy but highly intelligent woman who is totally in control when Zaphod is off his head, in this film she is looking up instruction manuals on how to fly the ship.As for the Vogons - where did they all come from? I have to say that some of the very funniest parts of the book, TV series and radio series are the book entries - these were sparse and the film actually required you to have seen or read some version of this before. I feel that many items were not funny without background and so a lot of the humour was lost this way.I have to say that it was just not well done and I certainly shan't be going to a sequel.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

I'm not going to try to answer that.It's all in there - the main themes and attitudes, the start and (almost) end points - and has been finished in such a way that there is more to the film than one-time shock value.I personally appreciate the fact that it takes more than once to understand all the subtle references and jokes that aren't so ""in your face"" as to make future sittings uncomfortable and even annoying.This is a great contribution to Adams' legacy and I will be proud to add it to my collection - and its excellent soundtrack as well.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

I am, however, very happy to report that, as in Eulogy, Zooey grounds a film that might have fallen over the edge of absurdity. With the help of Straight Man Martin Freeman, Deschanel allows the audience to experience this alternate universe without feeling lost in it. Their relationship provides a thread of believability in a galaxy where Sam Rockwell is the president (a brilliant choice - who will surely remind viewers of another under-qualified president) and Mos Def plays a perfect Ford Prefect (another inspired piece of casting that pays off richly). Add to that the subtle performances of Alan Rickman (depressed) and Bill Nighy (British enthusiastic or American somber) and you've built a ride through the galaxy that I can't wait to go on again.

853,fieryfiddler,"Good effects, Great Books, Horrible Movie!",2,1 May 2005,"When I first read the Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy, I never stopped laughing. Douglas Adams infused the books with quirky characters, bizarre coincidences, and wacky descriptions. The blunders of the outrageously stupid Zaphod Beeblebrox and the intelligent Trillian who has to save him and stop him from stupid acts that endanger both of them made for great reading. Using the Infinite Improbability Drive Adams wove in a myriad of coincidences that serve as political parody (the president of the galaxy being a powerless figurehead) to sheer randomness (the Hoovooloo, a super-intelligent shade of blue). The book is hilariously satirical on its own, however the filmmakers decided they had to include new characters and new plot points that hardly pull their weight. The movie spends the majority of the beginning talking about the disappearance of the dolphins and the stupidity of the Vogons, and how horrible the poetry is. It states that the supreme chancellor of something had to gnaw off his leg to survive, and shows Ford Prefect writhing in pain, but Arthur is happily blinking. In the book they explain the pain by having electric shock accompanying the reading, but this is failed to mention in the movie, making it unclear why Ford is so affected by the reciting. The Vogons have a new sidekick; the unemotional, boring Questular Rontok, whose point is unclear. Did she have a past romance with Zaphod? Apparently, but the filmmakers decided to not clue you in on this perhaps because they had no idea themselves; Questular Rontok is nowhere in the book. She is unsuccessful at stopping the rescue attempt on Vogosphere, which is nowhere in the book. It attempts to imitate Adam's comedy but crudely fails by instead using the unsophisticated 'joke' of people getting slapped when they get ideas. Very funny (after the first slap, just stupid). After this original failure the filmmakers bravely try again. In comes Humma Kavula. In the movie he introduces a plot point that lessens the main plot; searching for a Point of View gun that is nowhere in the book. It (!!SPOILER!!) reveals Trillian's underlying love for Arthur Dent, and then is out of the movie. Gone. So much for half the movie. The effects put the thing in proportion, with the gigantic Vogon ships, but the original sequences that stray from the book such as the alternate ending really ruin Adam's brilliant satirical galactic vision.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

It kept as closely to the book as you could, without having to have the other books made into movies to explain or deal with stuff.

These are the worst things about this movie: The acting was rubbish with the actors looking like they were bored. in particular Mos Def who ruined the brilliant character of Ford Prefect. Stephen Fry was a nice choice for the narrator and Zaphod was quite funny but thats it. The best dialogue from the book was cut out, the new character (played by John Malcovich)and the story that went with it was poor including Trillian being captured and Zaphods second head being sawn off. Marvin, I dare say was just plain bad with Alan Rickman sounding like he wasn't actually interested in doing the voice. Not to mention they made him look like this cute little thing. Too much information was crammed at you without pausing for breath and leaving you confused. I was confused within the first half an hour let alone bored! And I'm a huge fan of the books and the T.V series. I never realised how great the T.V show was until I saw this movie. To be honest there was one thing about this movie which was great and it lasted 5 seconds. This was the short cameo from the original Marvin from the T.V show. I tell a lie. They used the theme music from the T.V show which was a nice touch.I honestly wouldn't see this movie.

856,david-1773,Panic,1,14 May 2005,"The Hitchhiker's Guide movie is bad. Really bad. You just won't believe how vastly hugely mind-bogglingly bad it is. I mean, you may think Dodgeball and The Forgotten were bad movies, but they're just peanuts compared to the badness that The Hitchhiker's Guide movie is. It's worse than Vogon poetry. It's worse than the poetry of the Azgoths of Kria. It's so amazingly bad it's worse than the very worst poetry of all, which perished with its creator, Paul Nancy Millstone Jennings of Greenbridge, Essex, England, in the destruction of planet Earth.This movie should have perished in the destruction of planet Earth. After a wonderful radio series, five hoopy books, an enjoyable TV series, an interesting stage show, and a fun video game, someone had to turn on an Infinite Improbability generator to come up with something as wretched as The Hitchhiker's Guide movie. Douglas Adams couldn't have actually written any of these new scenes or new lines, not even after drinking three Pan Galactic Gargleblasters and having been eaten by the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal. As Marvin said, ""Why bother? What's the point?"" All the best gags and scenes of the book were deleted or passionlessly and minimalistically raced through in order to arrive at a whole lot of nothing, less than nothing. Long passages of nothing. Useless changes in the plot of the story, an overuse of visual effects, a pointless love story, a smarmy dolphin song, and less, all subtract up to an amazingly amazing misunderstanding by the actors and the director of whatever it was that Douglas Adams was really writing about, see if I don't.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

While this movie does contain CGI, it used it in the best possible manner, which is, simply, scenery. The backgrounds are beautiful, and the aliens are brilliantly crafted by the Jim Henson Creature Shop. While sometimes you begin to think that this movie is going nowhere, you don't have time to finish that thought, because in pops Alan Rickman as the voice of Marvin the Paranoid Android, whose body is given grace and life by Warwick Davis. Martin Freeman is an excellent choice for simple guy, Arthur Dent, as was Sam Rockwell as Zaphod Beeblebrox, Bill Nighy as Slartibartfast, and Mos Def as Ford Prefect. Zooey Deschanel acts proficiently in this movie as well, but it's really the men who make the film. The actual Guide is extremely creative, using something that looks like flash animation for each of its definitions, most poignantly during its definition of the ""Point of View"" gun.

Bush (don't let that stop you, if you aren't a W fan, it's not an impersonation as much as an approach), and kept expecting him to talk about the ""nucular weapons"". Marvin was hit dead on by Alan Rickman as the voice. I don't think he gets enough credit. As long as you don't go in expecting to see a video version of the book, you should really enjoy this.

The Vogons were over-emphasized, the Guide itself quickly vanished, a forced romantic subplot never took hold....and in short the film was a standard piece of summer flotsam and jetsam. Watch it for yourself and make your own conclusion. I, however, will continue to re-read the More Than Complete Guide on a yearly basis. Hell, who am I kidding...I'm gonna read it to my kids and hope that it speaks to them as it speaks to me...God, I feel like Marvin...who, by the way, was ill conceived and one dimensional....and that crap at the end....!!!

But what I remember loving most about it was the subtle, understated humor. The simple bizarre things that are presented as ordinary. It starts with the destruction of the Earth as an everyday occurrence in the grand scheme of things. What I don't remember is the emphasis on the love story, chase scenes, or shootouts. Was it there? I guess so, judging from the other comments. For me, this was an Americanized version of a great British comedy.

The effects were breathtakingly good. Finally a movie with a perfect blend of CGI and conventional means. CGI scenes were very good but what stands out in my mind was that the movie didn't rely solely on CGI. The vogons were so realistic thanks to Henson. Marvin transferred well to the big screen with some excellent one liners. One down side was that the movie changed the relationship of Arthur and Trillian to more than ever was in the book but was obvious next step. Slartibartfast was so great, monotone and bad at threats. I loved every scene that Marvin and slartibartfast appeared in.Overall i loved this film and i hope to see a sequel to it.Also keep your eye out. When the gang's on vogsphere waiting in line, pay attention to who's in the room. You'll be pleasantly surprised to see the old Marvin from the BBC series waiting in line. And the hologram that welcomes them to magrathea is the original Arthur dent from the BBC series.

862,dafamcas,Hollywood butchers another great story,4,30 April 2005,"Are you kidding me? After 25 years of waiting, this is what they come up with? Giant fly swatters smacking Arthur, Ford, and Zaphod in the face while they scream ""Waaaaa!""? Apparently the story had to be dumbed down for mainstream audiences: just replace the wit with slapstick. And how about the unnecessarily inflated love story between Arthur and Trillian? Good grief. Some other notable failures: 1) the very flat deliveries of some of the actors (Zooey Deschanel, Mos Def). In fact, none of the actors seemed particularly adept at comedy (except MAYBE Martin Freeman), or to have bothered with any background reading to figure out how to deliver their lines. 2) the rearrangement of Zaphod's physique (WHY?! They managed to give Zaphod 2 heads and 3 arms 20 years ago on a low budget BBC show...but they can't pull it off now?!). 3) the pointlessness of the John Malkovich character. 4) the chopping of so much funny narration and dialogue to make room for the unnecessary detours (Humma Kavula, Vogosphere). 5) Sam Rockwell's annoying accent. 6) the film makers don't even seem to know that the Restaurant at the End of the Universe is at the end of TIME, not SPACE. 7) the rare presence of the Guide itself in the film. 8) And on and on.It was even a little bit offensive that they had the BBC cameos (Marvin, Simon Jones, the music from the opening credits) in a shameless attempt to win over the more hardcore Hitchhiker fans. I have to admit, I fell for it. For at least 10 seconds of the movie I wasn't thinking, ""Wow, this is not very good.""A couple things WERE good: the Vogons themselves, the Magrathean ""factory floor."" Marvin was passable.Watch this movie and then go see the BBC version.

What I wasn't prepared for was the almost total elimination of the wonderful jokes Adams scattered throughout his work. The cutting of vital information. I kept waiting to laugh and I never did. Arthur Dent was amiable and vague, rather than querulous and paranoid. Ford Prefect (did we ever hear his full name?) was laid-back and smooth, rather than quirky and slightly manic. Trillion was just awful. What was the point of the unscripted romance? Zaphod was good, as was Slartybartfast (though we missed the amusement at his silly name). The vogons also missed their chance at humour. Why oh why did they change the script so radically? It's like Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy after surgical removal of all fun and humour. It was so dull, I gave up half way through and watched something else. Don't bother with it. It's a dud!",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
864,midwinter_m,Not worth one Altarian dollar a day,1,8 May 2005,"I'm not entirely sure what I expected when I went into the cinema to see this film. Generally speaking I've learned that movie adaptations of books cannot ever match the original novels - and indeed should not try to be precise copies - but I think I was encouraged to relax this view a little by the recent Lord of the Rings trilogy. Although it wasn't a perfect rendition I thought it remained true to the spirit of the original, and perhaps as a result I held out a little too much hope for ""Guide"". After all, they've had twenty-odd years to think about doing it justice. Obviously they weren't going to be adapting the entire five-book trilogy onto the screen, and they certainly weren't going to be doing it in a single movie's running time, so I knew there'd be some shortcuts taken.Unfortunately, the film fails to deliver in almost every respect. The characters so familiar to me from the book were nowhere to be seen - only the names remained. The acting was largely atrocious and most of the characters were startlingly irritating - with the possible exception of Ford Prefect only because, well, he's doesn't really do anything. The story entirely disappeared after the first ten minutes - the remainder of the movie bore little if any resemblance to the book and relied on a samey, formulaic Hollywood rewrite driven by flashy (if substandard) special effects.Altogether a letdown. I can't say an entirely unexpected letdown, but a disappointing one nonetheless. Oh, and as a final point: when Marvin the robot said, ""I have a brain the size of a planet"", I don't think he meant it literally. Future costume designers take note.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
865,ikzaztye,I love Marvin!!!,8,11 May 2005,"well, as a critical viewer i'd need to comment on the movie's hold. In my opinion there were numerous times whereby a detour was made and the plot was put on hold a while. it just didn't seem to run as smoothly as it should have. I believe the towel was neglected a great introduction. although it was often referred to in the movie there really wasn't much evidence as to why. i'm sure it would be obvious for readers of the book to identify it but for people like my who haven;t read the book yet, it remains unclear.However, one can only compliment the humour involved in the making of the movie. I carry no doubt that i was humoured by 98% of the jokes present, and was surprised on a few occasions where i seemed to be the only one to understand the joke. But i won't give it away.marvin (the depressed robot) is by far my favourite character. i don't know how long its going to take me to get over his humorous yet depressing phrased. and i love the dolphin song!! strongly recommended movie. but remember, if you go in expecting a serious film you'll walk out disappointed, expect nothing and you'll absolutely love it",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
866,WintermuteNight,See this movie at the theater during a matinée,7,29 April 2005,"I read the book not to long ago, and even though the movie is not one hundred percent to what the book said, the spirit is there in full force.Martin Freeman as Arthur Dent and Sam Rockwell as Zaphop Beeblebrox where the highlight of the film's cast. I was particularly pleased with how they dealt with Zaphod's unique physical condition. Very ingenious way of pulling it off. Mos Def, though not my first idea for Ford Prefect, one me over with some of the quirky little things he did. When it comes to Zoey Deschannel's portrayal of Trillan, it felt a little flat at times. There were moments when she was brilliant, but overall not the strongest link in the cast. As for Allen Rickman doing the voice of Marvin the Depressed Paranoid Android, its hard to hear depression in that voice, even though it was funny.The best part of this movie is the little clips from the Hitchhiker's Guide itself and the little nuances that I read in the book that I thought would be hard to translate into the movie. They were cut in very well and kept the movie constantly interesting to me. This two hour and ten minute film did not feel that long. It never dragged to me and that is a good thing.The effects are astounding. The Zorgon's are done incredibly, both with their look and the voice acting done with them. Its visually astounding to watch and it should be seen on the big screen.My only concern with this movie is that it humor may be too subtle for a lot of people to appreciate. This is not a laugh out loud, knee slap-per of a movie like I thought it might be. I should not have thought that in the first place since the book is not really like that to begin with. It is subtle, cynical, with good doses of irony involved. Its a movie with a lot of messages in it, just like the book. Some people will be overwhelmed by it and may loose sight of the hidden comedies that are interwoven in the movie.My biggest problem is its blatant ending that points to the fact that there needs to be another movie. Yes, the Hitchhiker series is five books (and one very interesting short story), but to leave an audience hanging about a major plot point in the movie is something I don't like.Overall, I would have not liked to have paid the full admission to see this film, but I am glad I saw it in the theater to see its overall grandeur.

867,digitaldivide,Almost Good,5,6 May 2005,"Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy was a good movie. Too bad that's all they could make out of an amazing book. Let's examine some of the good and bad that constitute our American film adaptation of what has been described as a novel of ""British Space"".Good points : Zooey Deschanel as Trillian was a very unusual choice, although her acting skill was amazing. She made Trillian a deeper, more believable character than it would otherwise have been. Martin Freeman as Arthur Dent. It's not easy to see things on a green screen and make us all believe that they completely mystify you. Not to mention his deadpan delivery of some of the funnier lines in the film makes a lot of people laugh ten seconds LATER, once they realize how funny what he just said was. The entries in the Guide are very well animated. Especially the sequence concerning Vogons. Jumping away from the exact plot of the books gave interesting things to the moviegoer who has already read them, and in contrast to most times this happens those events were not horribly out of place. Slartibartfast. Absolutely great portrayal from Bill. One of the high points of the movie.BAD things : The thing that annoys all the way through this movie is one man : Mos Def. His completely talentless fumbling for the comedy of Ford's lines can make you want to pull out your hair. It's very obvious that he has no idea how to pull off the character. There is a point where he tries to express pain and starts making faces like Chris Tucker in a Jackie Chan movie that just epitomizes his lack of understanding of the character he's playing. Zaphod comes off as VERY unlikable....this is not necessarily a bad thing, but his likability was one of the things many people enjoyed from the novel. In traditional American style, we've bumped up the importance of the Love Story angle. SO not necessary.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

They changed it completely and I hate it when you look forward to the movie of a book you've read and they go and give it a cliché ending. They also missed half the story and added in made up bits that weren't in the book at all. The special effects were good though but I think that they should have just remade the TV show or done several different movies. They also missed out a lot of the funny parts of the book (mostly the British humour)so all in all i think it was a bit too Disney but that could be because it was made by Disney and i think they ruin most books they make movies of.,The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

Being in Australia I'm even getting to see it before most others!! Bookings made (the theater turns up only 2/5 full). Here we go!! The intro is hilarious, then the beginning is straight out of the book, oh what a joy. I'd just like to point out some points about the way I felt about the film: 1: The layout of 'the book' is stupid and not timeless. 2: Acting is overall good, except; 3: Trillian plays well in parts, but dorky/overplayed in others. 4: Marvin is not used to his full funny potential (eventhough he appears a lot (which I do appreciate..)).. 5: The whole film is very true to the books (oh joy!! :-)) 6: I think it looses its pace sometimes, Adams has a way with his language to always keep it going, not thoroughly transferred to the movie. 7: The Vogons gets better and better all the way to the end.PS: Adams is king! Long live Adams! PPS: I'm sad for him never getting to see this film realised. PPPS: If U liked the film, read the books (I know that's a cliché)! But, they really are even funnier!

I don't want to sit in the cinema watching a line by line copy of the radio play, book, or TV series. Each of those stand by their own merit, and each were good largely because of the new material they contained.I think the cast did an excellent job, and although Zaphod wasn't quite how I pictured him, Sam Rockwell brought a freshness to the part which largely works. His portrayal of Zaphod as a guy who ""thinks he is cool"", rather than ""is cool"" works pretty well, and once you get over the southern drawl, he soon settles as a character. Ford is beautifully played, as are all the major characters.Admittedly, some of the criticisms that were voiced by Simpson have some justification, but most were simply overstated to support his general vitriolic attack on the ""purity"" of the film.In summary, go to see this film and don't worry.I'm looking forward to the DVD and I have all my fingers crossed for a sequel.Martin",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
872,pinkfurryprincess,So long and thanks for 2 hours of disappointment...,2,7 May 2005,"Only just short of awful, it is completely undeniable that this film is a major disappointment. I am a huge fan of the books so obviously felt let down by the lack of correlation with the original story, but once I resigned myself to that I couldn't help realising that The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy doesn't even work as a film in its own right. I imagine that HHGG virgins would be completely lost at what appears to be a strained, unfunny random sequence of events, as the plot jumps from one place to another so quickly it is difficult to detect any kind of point. As a fan, although I really don't want to be one of those people who despise book-adaptations because of their variation, the obvious differences such as the Arthur-Trillian love plot (that kind of ruins any possible sequels) and Zaphod's quest for the ultimate question (what does Zaphod care anyway?) disconnect the finely-tuned and cleverly constructed original plot and make it so confusing it's a waste of time. The special effects, although very clever, are either by-passed so quickly they're a waste of time or dragged out for way too long. The character of Humma Kavula, although written by Adams himself, is pointless and disrupts the already confusing plot, and again ruins the chance of any successful sequels (if they also pretend to mirror the plots in the books). Apologies to all fans of this film, but the clever dialogue, sparkling humour and simple yet effective characters have been stripped from this masterpiece and all that is left is a slow, boring, mediocre film.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

The simple answer to all this is to stand on the edge of a cliff, jump off and miss the ground.

But saying that it is one of those films like lord of the rings that the viewer will love if they know the story or have read the books. it is an appreciation think.

875,KenBlack,Another classic story ruined,1,21 April 2005,"I could not believe how awful this film was. The story has almost nothing to do with previous versions of Hitchhiker's Guide and just rambles all over the place, but not in any humorous or interesting or entertaining or enjoyable way.All the changes from the book and TV show and radio play seem to have been made for no reason and not only do they not add anything, they actually make it worse.The acting is uniformly terrible, except for Bill Nighy, and some of the design work is embarrassing, although the special effects are impressive.But the main problem with this film is that it is meant to be a comedy and it's just not funny at all. All the great comedy that was in the radio play and recreated in the books and recreated in the TV show and recreated (again) in the computer game has gone. All that is left is a lot of people falling over and getting slapped in the face and I don't remember any of that from the previous versions.Nothing is explained. They don't even explain why the story stops for 20 minutes in the middle of the film while John Malkovich wanders around and talks for a bit. Was that from a different movie? It seemed to have no connection with the rest of the film.As a long-time fan of Hitch-Hikers Guide, who has enjoyed all the previous versions, I thought this movie was just dreadful, and I couldn't even enjoy it as a movie on its own because it was so badly made. Douglas Adams deserves better than this. I hope he was right in his atheist belief because it would be awful if he could look down from heaven and see what these people have done in his name.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

The movie brings to life the plot and its utter absurdity in a fantastic way. I was impressed by its ability to hold fast to some key elements of the novel despite the dialogue and action lack in the written version (the narrator helped). But I am not critiquing the movie opposed to the book, but as a fan of it. As such, WOW!. Vibrant backdrops, impeccable casting, a script that offers humor. I know that it could use some deepening, for this reason I was tempted to vote 7, but decided that I should vote 10 to offset all the non-fans who were unjustly put off by this movie's silliness and pseudo-coherency.In total the movie is excellent. Even non-fans can truly enjoy it, but it is a Definite must-see for Douglas Adams fans, and young adult sci-fi fans who have yet to be introduced to the possibilities in sci-fi humor., and fans of the absurd, and anyone who thinks Zooey Deschanel is the most gorgeous actress in film...and...",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
877,phillips_bernstein,The Hitchhiker's Guide to Hollywood,2,20 May 2005,"The IMDb people, I'm sure, would have me judge this on its own terms, but it's not exactly clear what those terms are. On the one hand, the movie would seem ostensibly to represent an attempt to adapt to the screen Douglas Adams's book or at least his comic sensibility. Judged on these terms, it fails miserably. On the other hand, it doesn't seem to be trying especially hard to adapt Douglas Adam's book or comic sensibility. It seems rather more intent on making a warm and fuzzy Disney movie for children. It does much better at this, but still doesn't quite succeed. For one thing, it's too much of a mishmash. For another thing, it's never funny.It has three kinds of jokes: 1) old Adams jokes sabotaged, 2) new dumb corny jokes that aren't funny, and 3) new jokes (or at least ones I don't recognize) that are actually pretty clever and also not funny. There is no reason a dumb corny joke can't be funny in the right hands (a fortiori a pretty clever joke), and I thus conclude that these jokes must not be in the right hands. This director must have no developed sense of comic timing. I blame the director. When I say the old jokes are sabotaged, I mean I think they've been deliberately spoiled to change the tone of the movie in a calculated manner.Trillion here is pretty cute (in contradistinction to pretty pretty). Her drawl and ruffledness are pretty cute. In one scene she looks as if someone had spent hours mussing her hair just right, and she holds herself rigidly as if afraid she might accidentally unmuss it. The movie makers seem to have gone to some trouble to find a perfect Trillion match for Arthur. Why? To make the thing warm and fuzzy. I'd be willing to bet money that Adams was thinking of Tom Baker when he described Ford Prefect in the books. Mos Def is warmer and fuzzier and mumbles like the aged Bill Cosby and goes around hugging people. I'm tempted to say that the happy ending (the restoration of the earth) overdoes warm and fuzzy even on warm-and-fuzzy's home turf. It confounds science fiction (and I use the term ""science fiction"" in the loosest sense possible) and magic. But maybe Disney warm-and-fuzzy requires magic in the way that ""Groundhog Day"", for example, seemed to require it. This is the Hollywood mindset: You acquire a vehicle with a built-in audience, and then you force it into some pre-existing mold.I disagree with various reports I've seen that Zaphod here is parodying Bush. This Zaphod has a Texas drawl, yes, (and that's one too many drawls), but Bush seems instead to have a fake Appalachian Mountain accent that seems to come and go. I hated Zaphod's extra head, which is actually not so much an extra head as an extra face in his neck. I hated the music--not in musical terms; I don't care about that--but in dramatic terms. Stock clown music when we're clowning and stock love music when Arthur is pining aloud about Trillion appreciably hurts. The dolphin song is a sort of Disney dilution of Eric Idle's cross song from ""Life of Brian"", although to be sure, ""Life of Brian"" 's title song parody of John Barry's ""Goldfinger"" song is even more idiotic than the dolphin song. Since John Malkovich spews out of flurry of transitive verbs without objects and no one else makes this particular kind of grammatical error, I almost suspect Malkovich of writing his own lines--or maybe editing them--or maybe the movie is spoofing Malkovich's phoniness.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

I just got home from it, and you have to love it. If you like the book at all, you will at least find it decent. My brother, thought it did not have enough funny parts, but I myself loved every second of it. The string part, the dolphin song!!! ""Everthings Going To Be Destroyed, No Use In Getting All Annoyed"" If I were to remake it tough, I would have given it a higher budjet, not saying the production values were low, they were not, but there were quite a few parts where more money would have done better, such as the moment right after the earth is destroyed, or on the vogon planet.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

880,heyna,"why, why, why?",1,2 May 2005,"the movie itself lays out the answer to one of its biggest flaws. Love, says the guide, should be avoided at all costs. it is not an exact quote but i find it painful to remember the movie. many people have defended the movie with the specter of Adams and the oft used excuse that book to film translations are just not possible. i cannot agree when 40 percent of the movie deviates so far from the radio, television and book versions it is not an interpretation, it is made up completely. yes, writers like to rearrange their works as they revisit them but not once in the previous versions did Trillian ever care for Arthur other than as a fellow human. it is true that Arthur finally gets a girlfriend in so long and thanks for all the fish but she is not Trillan. it is a foolish decision to make a relationship when it was never there and the story was just fine without it. Another enraging topic is the wasted time with the minutes of stock footage which does nothing to move the story forward but takes away valuable time which could have been used for funny and plot propelling dialogue from the book, television show or radio play. perhaps the title song was clever and everyone likes frolicking dolphins but it is not some fluff that should be usurping the dialogue that was lost in the confrontation in front of Arthur's home. more stock footage in the start up the planet sequence just made the badly reworked visit to earth which did not happen in the previous versions more irritating. they viewed earth briefly and had had a nice meal in a dining hall in magrathera. i do not consider myself to be a die hard fan boy as i really did not like so long and thanks for all the fish and never read mostly harmless. i just feel that it was a poor rendering and should not be forgiven so blithely as many have done. there is a point at which people who are entrusted with a beloved book and millions of dollars should be held accountable if they make so many unimportant and in my mind detrimental changes. it did not become a best selling novel because it was in great need of rewriting. Zaphod's second head is also a terrible rework. he has two heads because he is vain not to hide something in his brain. there was a whole other quite sufficient explanation for that in the third book. the first book did not bother with that plot point. maybe adams did write in the Humma Kavula head hostage bit but even originators can ruin their own work. i will stop now not because i should but i just do not think i will have enough space to continue pointing out all the errors in the film.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

But they lost a lot of the good stuff.There are certainly some belly-laughs, stories and dialog missing. Fans will be disappointed, others will be confused. No mention of the update to the Earth entry in the guide that Ford was researching for all those years, for example - changing ""Harmless"" to ""Mostly harmless"".What remained was a rush, and blur, between one point in the newly fabricated plot to another. There were love-interests that had no business being there. And the Vogons (though well done) got way too much screen time. Marvin was a cutesy child-like robot with a large round head (a depressed Disney character), and almost everyone was American and slurred like a drunk.There was some good eye-candy - the special effects were clever enough.

883,charlismorgan,"Don't Panic! Douglas Adams' legacy has been turned into a delicious acid-trip of a movie, featuring love, aliens and the answer to life, the universe and everything.",8,27 April 2005,"Douglas Adams turned his sci-fi phenomenon, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy into a hit radio and TV series, a five-part trilogy of novels and a BAFTA-winning computer game, but complained making it into a movie was like ""trying to grill a steak by having a succession of people blow on it"". After a 20-year battle with Disney to get the film made - and a day after a planet was named after the story's protagonist Arthur Dent - Adams died of a heart attack. Fans rushed to their nearest webring to console each other when they discovered the bum-clenchingly great scripting responsibilities had been passed on to Karey Kirkpatrick, the brains behind fluffy kiddie flick, Chicken Run. To make matters worse, Terry Gilliam and Jay Roach passed the honour of directing the film to Garth Jennings and Nick Goldsmith, two movie first-timers who made their livings as production duo Hammer & Tongs - the company behind music videos for REM, Supergrass and Pulp among others. But Don't Panic! As Robbie Stamp, Adams' pal and the movie's executive producer, rightfully says, ""The cast and crew rose to the challenge and created the perfect tribute to Douglas.""The film carefully brings the story into the noughties without incurring the wrath of Hitchhiker fans, and adds enough smug nods in their direction to keep them happy. They will relish whispering to their unimpressed cinema neighbour, ""Look, Douglas Adams' face is in that shot"" or ""That's Marvin the Paranoid Android from the TV series."" And for the uninitiated, there's an acid-trip of a movie featuring love, aliens and the answer to life, the universe and everything. A galaxy of stars were enlisted to bring the mind-boggling story to the big screen, including Martin Freeman, who reprises his superb Everyman role from The Office to play Arthur Dent, a tea-loving Londoner who becomes the last man from Earth, following its destruction to make way for a hyperspace bypass. Mos Def proves not all hip-hop stars are fist-gnawingly embarrassing as actors, in his part as Ford Prefect, a revoltingly cool alien who accompanies Dent on his hitchhiking adventure around the universe.The unspeakably delicious Zooey Deschanel provides the love story that was sadly lacking in Adams' script drafts. She plays Trillian, the last surviving humanoid female, who finds herself caught in an unsavoury love triangle between Dent and Zaphod Beeblebrox, the President of the Imperial Galactic Government and owner of three arms, two heads and one planet-sized ego. And if you've ever wondered what Freddie Mercury and George Bush's lovechild would be like (and frankly, who hasn't?) watch Sam Rockwell's extraordinary portrayal of Beeblebrox. As Rockwell testifies, ""I studied footage of US presidents and rockers for this role until I tasted blood.""The essential Britishness of the film is provided by the delectable Stephen Fry and Bill Nighy, who are more English than chips, awkward dinner parties and halitosis.Who better to voice The Guide, a book which contains all the knowledge in the universe, than bulging-brained Fry, who uses the perfect amount of middle-class haughtiness, irony and intelligence to narrate the delightfully complicated story.And Nighy can't fail as planet builder Slartibartfast (who, as every nerd knows, won an award for creating the twiddly bits around Norwegian fjords) because he based the world-weary alien on the nation's best-loved character, Bill Nighy.I almost missed out one character, insane religious leader Humma Kammula, a new character Adams wrote especially for John Malkovich. He is easily forgotten because despite his amusing dialogue, the special effects drown out his performance, preventing him from doing the honour justice.But fans will forgive this small transgression, for the pleasure of seeing a beast of a movie which has defied the laws of the universe to make it onto the big screen.Jennings and Goldsmith have proved that despite their movie virginity, the first time isn't always messy, awkward and disappointing, it can also be earth shattering, amusing and very, very satisfying.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

Marvin being my favourite character was OK, but again not as good as I'd hoped. What happened to the talking door? why only a sigh?! The vogons where not green enough, the ship with the improbability drive just didn't look right and why throw a romance in...? I realise the film had to be made to appeal to a wider audience but...

And then, just for the sheer, unbridled hell of it, it stopped having anything to do with the book again 2 minutes later.The characters had nothing more than their names in common with the books, and outside of that, the characters they did play were played so badly that the studio must have hired an ""unfunny acting coach"" to come in and make sure that any potentially funny lines were delivered with the worst possible sense of timing.The best and most authentic thing about this film was the theme song.Go re-watch the terrible early 80's film version.

However, the movie was underdeveloped, predictable, and just plain silly. I did not care about characters (the few times I had any idea who they were or what they were doing), and the entire plot was totally contrived and the little sense it made was hung on a very thin skeleton in which we were just supposed to accept these eccentric characters for no reason. Malkovich's character was completely unnecessary, and the whole ""Life's pointless, but try to be happy anyway."" running through the movie just made it depressing. It's a crime to compare this to Monty Python. :-)",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
887,olly-buxton,Perfectly Normal Paranoia?,7,28 April 2005,"There's a simple reason this movie has taken so long to make, and it's this: while Douglas Adams' classic The Hitch-Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy is a hilarious book, it's a rubbish novel. I mean that in the nicest possible way  it's one of my favourite books, but it's barely a story at all  more a set of dead-eye, deadpan observations on the absurdity of life, and particularly the British way of life, revolving very loosely around a chap in a dressing-gown. While that's great fodder for a comedy read, it's no basis for a coherent, 90 minute motion picture, especially one having the American market in mind.It's a matter of record that Douglas Adams realised there was no story, but not until it was too late to fix it (about halfway through book two). From that point onwards made several attempts to pull everything back into a single coherent, archetypal story but totally failed, and in the process ruined the remaining three and a half books themselves, none of which are funny, let alone a good story.A film-maker has a choice, therefore: stick with the material and film something which is not so much a screenplay as an extended, themed version of Saturday Night Live, or do some significant damage to the source material  ""zap straight off to its major data banks and re-program it with a very large axe"", if you will  and make a story out of it.The first option will in equal measure thrill and infuriate the party faithful, but bore the rest of the population; the second will most likely infuriate the party faithful, but at least has a chance with everyone else. Since the Hitch-Hiker's Guide is now twenty years old, there is probably a whole generation who, so far in their lives, have missed it altogether, so you can hardly blame director Garth Jennings for choosing option two.What instead we should do is take our hats off to him: he's fashioned a great story but preserved surprising amounts of the source; his innovations are sympathetic and in a couple of cases (the point-of-view gun and the face-slapping devices on the Vogsphere) are a match for the original material; the wonderful production design thoroughly captures the lovable Britishness of Adams' story (the Vogons hover somewhere between the schoolmasters of '70s Pink Floyd and the sort of bureaucrats whom you might find behind the desks of some Ministry of Monty Python's devising), and on top of all that he's coaxed some wonderful performances out of the cast. Martin Freeman captures Arthur Dent's everyman perfectly and has real chemistry with Zooey Deschanel's Trillian; John Malkovich, Bill Nighy, Bill Bailey and both the original Arthur Dent and Marvin from the BBC TV series make hilarious cameos, as does the smiling face of the late creator himself, Douglas Adams, as the very last shot of the movie. That was a splendid touch.The less forgiving purists are bound to gripe about what's missing; but on the whole I'm the more forgiving sort of purist. Perhaps there is something sinister in the conspicuous omission the Babel Fish ""proof"" for the non-existence of God  was that a Disney-required edit or just my perfectly normal paranoia?  and I was a bit sad my favourite exchange in all of Douglas Adams' writing was omitted (Arthur: ""It's at times like this, when I'm trapped in a Vogon airlock with a man from Betelgeuse, and about to die from asphyxiation in deep space that I really wish I'd listened to what my mother told me when I was young."" Ford: ""Why? What did she say?"" Arthur: ""I don't know, I didn't listen""), but overall this was an extremely enjoyable, touching experience and I can't think of a better way to have rounded off an otherwise trying Thursday.Thursdays. I never could get the hang of Thursdays.Olly Buxton",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

I was surprised that Mos Def was as good as he is in this film, and felt he was perfect for the role of Ford. One of my major concerns was that the scattered narrative of the book wouldn't work on the big screen, but my fears were unfounded ad the film flows quite nicely from scene to scene and doesn't loose it's focus or seem fractured at all.

The movie opens with the most random SONG I've ever seen. I thought since Douglas Adams was involved it would reflect the comedic genius of the books. Notsomuch. The good thing about the books is they were so wonderfully random yet everything was pieced together and it all made sense. Like the mention of he girl whose story it is ""not"" in the first chapter, or the bowl of flowers. But it just comes off as stupid when you see it in the movie. See, most of the humor in the novels was via narration, which is hard to translate into a movie. I thought the movie was... OK... but I had such high hopes for it that I was very very disappointed by it. I liked their casting for Marvin, though. The Snape guy.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
890,sanjibm,Do Panic!,3,29 April 2005,"If you're a Hitchikers fan, no one can stop you from watching this movie, so I'm not even going to try. But for anybody who hasn't read this book, I strongly urge you to do so before watching the movie.As an adaptation from Douglas Adam's widely popular book, and seventies BBC radio script, this movie can be classified as poor. On the other hand, as a movie in its own right, this can be classified as awful, and somewhat damaging to your senses. What were they thinking? Didn't they bother to see the completed movie before it was released? Is this the very movie that Douglas himself helped create?I couldn't believe that this is the much longed-for movie version of the Hitch Hikers Guide to the Galaxy. I had my doubts that Hollywood would ruin it eventually, and they have done so. When I first read the book, I thought that its plot was indeed 15 billion years in the making, summing up civilisations and humanity in the most beautifully crafted way, making you laugh, making you cry, sometimes at once, showing you how minuscule you really were while simultaneously teaching you how to fly, forcing you to revisit every idea and belief that you ever had or were going to have. The wit, comedy, the spontaneity, the urgency, the characters, the absurdity, the wisdom, the inventiveness, the satire, the adventure has been a part of me for close to 2 decades.So what's in the movie? It's a colourful outer-space romp that plays like a Jackie Chan travelogue. Never waiting for that essential pause between the beats, the movie moves on in a dazzle of spectacular Hollywood special effects without any rhythm, elegance or comic rhyme. Yes, they have forgotten to include some of the best parts and dialogue from the book, i.e. Arthur describing to the Heart of Gold's computer, the art of making tea, and numerous other examples, which have robbed the story of that intimacy that's so required for any kind of character development. True, that in transitioning to an artistic medium such as cinema, we must be selective of what we want to adapt and we must provide new and appropriate material . Yet, I seriously think that the choices made were wrong, and the overall content was aimed at a audience that surely the book wasn't. If I were to dedicate this to the memory of Douglas Adams, I would think twice.Martin Freeman is the lovable Brit, who in my opinion was well casted as Arthur Dent. Stephen Fry's exceptional voice as the Guide, went a long way in trying to bring in some of the unique wisdom from the book, and its laptop-like display panel opening up with an explanation at times when you thought you were losing it. As for the other characters, I didn't find anything more than a visual manifestation for names in the book. There were some good performance, yet there was nothing in there that was memorable.In conclusion, the movie failed miserably. I wished it could have tried a little harder. What disheartens me most, is that I'll probably have to wait decades before anyone ever attempts a remake.

I really wanted to like it, because I loved the book/radio versions and thought Adams' genius would make a great movie even if they only used a small part of the story; but this movie wouldn't even meet me half way. Entire plot strands are started and not finished, characters appear with no explanation of who they are, there's a dreadfully unconvincing ""love story"" worked into the plot, and a lot of the actors have a mystified ""OK I'll just say the words and get it over with"" attitude that I haven't seen since The Phantom Menace. It has a generally weary feel to the storytelling, as if in the hands of a director at home with technology but not to directing people.

Mainly because they tried to cram so much of the story into such a short space of time, not to mention all the new additions to the story. Either a longer movie or a series like LoTR would have been much more appropriate.A lot of the good jokes from the books were gone, and the plot was rather rushed. Anyone who's heard the shows and read the books many times (like me) will often be waiting for a funny bit they remember, and find it's not there. And most (I say most, there are a few notable exceptions) of the new jokes aren't up to par. Except Marvin, he's really good, as is Stephen Fry as the book/narrator.Graphically it's very pretty, the CG sequences are rather well done, but I'm one of those weird people who think this doesn't make up for a rushed plot and fewer jokes.Luckily, while it has obviously been Americanised a bit (addition of a token Big Bad Evil Guy and a romantic subplot) the Hollywood ""style"" hasn't infected it too badly.For someone new to the H2G2 universe it'll be a good movie, and will probably introduce a lot of people to the books.

894,pfarq,In my mind.,10,30 April 2005,"OK, I was always going to like this film.There are some who will not like it... but if you're like me and DNA's stories have shaped your life in very fundamental ways, then this film will put a warm glow in your belly.Granted, there are a number of filmisms which seemingly get in the way, however you would have to be a complete single celled organism not to realise that even the greatest labours of love in the film world have to have commercial appeal.And that's the point... these stories have zero commercial appeal, they're just great. I think people after waiting so long to see this film, will be wanting it to redefine, or re-explain the meaning of life for them, as though by surgically and precisely crafting a witty and thought provoking 'satire on modern life' (a complaint I heard by a radio reviewer), that some sort of insight will be gained.DNA's philosophy was always that these issues are in the end insignificant and meaningless, and you might as well just get on with it and have a good time. In these troubled times, it's important to keep one foot firmly in the ground, focusing wherever possible on that relentless passion for humanity that Douglas shared with us.This is what this film does, more brilliantly and fantastically than I could have hoped for.The casting was spot on. Every character fit their part like a 4 year old tennis shoe. The art direction was stunning, each frame a work of art in itself. The vogons had enough dark crystal magic to take your breath away in places.I had a wonderful time from the lights dimming to the credits. If you didn't like it, then find something else to do.

895,berenice_baker,A highly biased review,7,29 April 2005,"Don't get me wrong. This movie hasn't quite ripped out my cherished childhood memories, spat and stomped on them and handed them back to me spoiled and ruined. However, I am unable to divorce myself from the fact I've been a H2G2 fan since the late 70s and a member of the fan club since my early teens. This movie has been considered, mentally cast, screen written, and directed by me for the last 20 years. I am unable to give an unemotional review. If you're OK with that, let's plunge on.I had set my expectation-meter to low as I entered the cinema, as anything else would have been asking for disappointment. The beginning was excellent, just how I'd have wanted it. Stephen Fry IS the voice of the book. Martin Freeman does make a suitably ignorant of his fate Arthur Dent. That bloke from the League of Gentlemen really does make it seem like Mr Prosser is a frustrated descendant of Ghengis Khan. And it really is a sign of how long this phenomenon has been in the making when they pay for the beer. When they eventually played Journey of the Sorcerer (the original theme tune), I was able to let my guard down and get my hopes up again. That was my mistake.Like the story of the Book itself, the review of the film is best told through that of the characters surrounding it. Martin Freeman underplays Arthur Dent as a bumbling Englishman abroad. The problem was he's just a little too sappy, without the sarcastic comeback Simon Jones delivered, and not nearly as frustratingly ungenerous in expressing his emotions. Mos Def was a surprisingly likable Ford, but was lacking somewhat in the role of smug guide showing off the Universe to someone who's never been off their planet. Zooey Deschanel's Trillian was at least played as a believable intelligent free-spirited woman, but as such became a bit of a stereotype of female sci-fi leads. And yet no mention of the degree in maths and another in Astrophysics They played up Duckface I mean Anna Chancellor's role to redress the proportions (and there were female Vogons too) but I still felt like my gender was represented by a mish-mash of pastiches (try saying that after a couple of gin and tonics). Sam Rockwell's Zaphod was pretty much as described in the book, but was just a bit too dumb to be elected Galactic President rather than just having hidden a little of his brain from himself (a concept which I think was skipped over somewhat). There's no film where I don't welcome John Malkovich, but the role Adams had apparently written for him was incongruous and seemed to throw the plot off at a tangent. Bill Nighy's Slartibartfast was a delight.Voice wise, I think Alan Rickman was cast for a more languorously depressed voice than the one he delivered for Marvin. But Bill Bailey's whale showed the touch of a true fan. Helen Mirren's Deep Thought however showed neither depth nor thought.There are special guest appearances by member of the original cast, and for the record Adam's wife, daughter and sister had roles as extras in the film, which was nice, as I believe they'd given a lot of help with the estate and giving access to his notes etc.I knew there was going to be some internationalisation of the cast and plot. I like the fact that having an American accent and touchy-feely behaviour made perfect sense to Arthur Dent that Ford was an alien all along. But isn't it a little patronising to make a bypass a freeway? We don't insist that all turnpikes be edited out of our imported movies in the same manner. So if Ford and his semi-cousin Zaphod have the same accents, where does that leave Trillian? And when Earth's sector of space was referred to as ""Zee Zee 9 Plural Zee Alpha"" my skin nearly crawled off my flesh and out into the concessions area.The animation of the Guide has a nice, blocky diagrammatic feel, an update of the type used in the TV series. After all, I guess few people have a frame of reference to the type of green-screen graphics used there any more.As in Constantine, it seemed unnecessary action sequences had been forced into the plot to engage the audience. But for someone who knows and loves H2G2 for the dialogue, it was a bit of a patronising letdown to cut out big sequences of well-loved script in favour of needless shoot-outs. And the armed ranks of Vogons seemed at odds with their main threat through bureaucracy and rather smacked of a low-end version of the various LOTR war scenes.The special effects were terrific, I'll give 'em that. The inside of Magrathea, which I thought would be impossible to carry off, was beautifully realised.I'd tell you ""Don't Panic"" but it might take a while to find that advice as it appears to be on the back cover In summary, I give it 6.5/10. If you're a fan, go see it, it's completely unmissable. There are plenty of fond tributes and in-jokes that will add to the pantheon and maybe make you shed a tear when ""For Douglas"" appears on the screen. If you're not, you will wonder what all the fuss is about and hope the promise of a sequel at the end is thwarted by the box-office it deserves.

897,g1vr6,Not really worth a visit even for curiosity sake.,3,29 April 2005,"I have to admit that I feel that this version of the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy was a very poor film. There were a few whimsical moments but not enough to carry the movie. Try as I might I still don't get the visual gag with Marvins arm and some of the punchlines were drowned out or were badly delivered. On the positive side Sam Rockwell as Zaphod and Alan RIckmans voice as Marvin were the only bright spots in this example of money over substance. The Special effects are well done, restrained and not over the top. The plot line is close to the original story line however I don't think the story has weathered the passing of the years. This film has all the hallmarks of another British film that you will have wished you had waited until it got to video/DVD and even then you will be poised on the fast forward button. Not many radio shows have been transitioned to the cinema and even fewer have been successful. This unfortunately in my own humble opinion will be in the unsuccessful group. This is a film for the Douglas Adams enthusiast.I do not expect it to have wide appeal to the general public.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

It took me a long time to persuade my wife that it is a great story and really funny . Strangely she still doesn't believe me - my two lads - both pre-teens thought it was funny so I guess that is where the humour was aimed . There were no more than half a dozen laughs in the cinema throughout the whole film . Nothing fitted together . Set-ups just stopped and punchlines were missing . Why ? Oh why ? Oh why ? did they do this . Yes the CGI was good but without the humour it was not HHGG .Sorry Hopefully the good lady will let me watch the TV version next week .,The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
899,mizmalcontent,Decent.,7,29 April 2005,"OK. I'm going to start with what bugged me first...Couple of dialogue cringe moments, particularly in the beginning. I feel the lines were unnecessarily shortened and it did kill the joke. I think they were rushing to the punchline without setting up the joke first. Their interpretation of infinite improbability drive would give a mathematician a twitch for a week. The point of Humma is still unknown... I think that should have been developed better to make one actually interested in learning what happens there. And yes, Marvin was under used.What I did like:I don't mind the addition of a new character, however, and the joke about DOuglas' nose. I don't have a problem with making this a love story. It was kinda cute. They were true enough to the text that this was still about the book. But it isn't a replica. Go looking to be entertained... and not to see your favorite line being said.I did laugh out loud at times. There are some very funny moments. I'm really trying hard here not to spoil with some key points... The characters acted as they should. Zaphod was hysterical. Everyone did a fine job in making me believe they were who they were supposed to be.Finally: I think rabid fans that know the text line by line will be disappointed. I truly think that the only way to have an exact replica of the book would be to have a 6 hour film and it would be cgi'd to death.I was pleased and amused in spite of the cringe moments.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
900,superstarr173-1,Not worth the $$,1,29 April 2005,"This movie is nothing like the book. I am a fan of Douglas and I think that he would be weeping now if he saw what was done to his work.Honestly, I was extremely bored. Even if I had not read the books, I still would have been bored. There was a lack in character development and the plot was so confusing. Douglas purposely uses shattered plot development in order to parallel the answer that Deep Thought is supposed to answer. The book is funny. The movie is not. The movie isn't even entertaining. Rockwell did a poor job acting like a believable Zaphod and Trillian was out of character that I was surprised that they still allowed her to be called Trillian.This is a poor review. I know. I am still a bit shaken by what I just spent the last two hours sitting through. If you have not read the book, go ahead and watch the movie. If you have read the book(s), stay far far away from the movie and watch it only with extreme void of knowledge of the true H2G2.The BBC mini-series did a much better job adapting the book to the screen. Watch that if you have any notion of honoring the work of Douglas.

Faithful to the absolutely hilarious book, the film is, in short, a good time. The film is filled with good, clean humor. It's slightly satirical and a little wacky, think Kurt Vonnegut meets Monty Python. The best bits from the book are included with some new stuff added. As for all you buffs of the book who don't like the minor changes I say tough--they were still funny and didn't hurt anything. The humor is brilliant. It won't have you rolling on the floor, well maybe, but it will make you laugh a good heart-felt laugh. You'll feel better after seeing this.The acting was pretty good. Sam Rockwell was perfect as Zaphod and Mos Def did a great job as Ford. Both characters seem a little off but believe me its not the acting, the characters are supposed to be that way.If you have a problem with plot holes you may find some things a little disagreeable. The book was part of the series and as the movie is almost perfectly faithful some things set up for parts in later books, but they still don't hurt anything. I have no idea if sequels are planned.To sum it up I loved this movie and I'm one of the most die-hard Adams fans there is. It's hilarious and it made me feel good. Any flaws are easily overlook-able in terms of the big picture. And best of all it did exactly what Adams wanted it to do: it entertained and made me think.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

Many fans also know that the old BBC re-creations were ... lackluster to say the least. But now the technology exists to realize Douglas Adams' rich and whimsical universe, and it does this brilliantly!The new Star Wars are OK, but Jar Jar is only one example of what happens when you abandon live action, or even puppets for that matter. Sin City and Sky Captain ATWOT had nice effects, but left the performances wooden. Hitchhiker's Guide on the other hand, nails everything perfectly!The acting is awesome (Marvin is perfect, especially compared to the old BBC version of him), the special effects are jaw dropping, yet not over the top (probably due to many of the aliens having been produced by Jim Henson's Creature Shop), the wonderful British character is still present in abundance, and the timing is incredibly polished. It's also incredibly accessible to non-sci-fi people as well, since almost nothing is based in science, so no Star Trek to English dictionary is required.If you like British-style comedy or sci-fi in the least, you NEED to see this movie.

905,jpgrimmly,Movie critics suck,9,29 April 2005,"I just got back from seeing the movie and I thought it was great. I'm a big fan of the other versions of the story and did not expect it to be the same as any other version because I know that none of the other versions are exactly alike. I was surprised at how good Ford Prefect was portrayed and they also did a great job with Zaphod even with the odd way they did the two head thing. I went to see this with two people that had never read, listened to or watched any other version of the story and was surprised that even they loved it. They seemed to like Marvin most of all and who can blame them. The only complaint I have about the movie is the love story between Arthur and Trillian which has no business in this movie and seems to be the one thing that was kind of Hollywoodish about it. Also the POV gun thing didn't seem to fit in all that well and even though it is kind of a funny idea it just didn't fit right. There are a lot of things that only a fan could appreciate but they were subtle enough that a newcomer to it wouldn't even have noticed that there was anything to be noticed (the music for one thing and also the cameo of the old version of Marvin and a lot of other things). I'm just rambling on about it but I've seen so many reviews now from critics that just don't get it and the arguments they have about it not being a good movie are basically that there are too many jokes coming at them too fast and that they are so slow in the head that they don't understand any of it.

906,igor_stravinsky,"many positive elements, but overall, a disappointment.",5,30 April 2005,"I'm not an ultra geek fan of the various original incarnations of this story, but i do have a soft spot for Douglas Adams' humour and imagination. Consequently i had been long looking forward to this film. Loved the trailers, was happy with the casting, slightly bemused with the choice of composer, but, nevertheless, was happy to see the accumulating positive responses to this film.My friend and I both considered leaving the movie theatre from around halfway through the presentation.Basically, as many others have mentioned, the highlights of this film are many: Stephen Fry's narration combined with some charming animations, Bill Nighy's Slartibartfast, the Vogons, the overall visual design, Malkovich, Marvin, Steve Pemberton etc. etc. the list goes on.The problems really lie in the main cast of characters - our quartet of 'heroes' feel uneasy together (miscasting?) and the enhanced romantic interest is unfortunate. Also, the pacing becomes increasingly haphazard, but most frustratingly, poor slapstick humour dominates much of the second half of this film. Adam's wit (which seemed to be left fairly intact at points) effectively dissolves away leaving little more than cheap entertainment.So near, yet so far!

I sat in the theater for nigh on 2 hours with at least 60 other people and apart from a few isolated giggles, the audience was very, very quiet. This is an amusing movie, but it is far from truly funny. And yes, in case you are wondering, I am 47 years old - old enough to be an original Guide fan. I read the original novel when it was new. I loved it. And I read all the others books in the series and I watched the BBC TV version. I am a big fan of Douglas Adams.

It is inevitable that a great amount of editing of the original material would be required to create a movie. However, this is butchery. To leave out so much genuinely funny material and instead create some soppy love story is a great mistake. This film and the series of books deserved to be treated to a Star Wars or Lord of the Rings style series of films. If something is worth doing then do it properly. I don't think the Hollywood produces get it... some scenes were groaningly bad, especially the prisoner release form filling one. It simply was not funny.

One of which slammed this movie for not matching the book and a lot of people took that as the yes or no on going to see this. There has yet to be a single Douglas Adams franchise in the Hitchhikers series that has ever completely followed the story of another. Adams NEVER would have a movie completely match. That said, this movie is FUNNY! There are several nods to the TV show, so watch closely. The casting was completely perfect, Alan Rickman as the voice of Marvin steals the show. Sam Rockwell IS Zaphod. I'm a die hard fan, but my husband is not, He thought it was the funniest movie he's seen in a long time. If you are a fan of the books, keep an open 'Adams' mind and realize that this movie is in the spirit of Hitchhikers and does keep true to the franchise.

Mos Def as ford was such a great casting and without going through the list of actors ill just stick with every actor was how i pictured them in the book, even Zaphod though having two head just different that in the book. All the changes to the plot i felt did just fine and the improbability drive made for some hilarious circumstances (uh oh looks like Arthur's gonna throw up) and then the puppet work by Jim Henson company was also some of the best I've ever seen them do. ONe of the plots kinda just got lost but i didn't mind, the movie was good enough to let it slid.

I'm still unsure why ANYBODY ever tries to compare the success or failures of a movie adaptation to the original text; it's simply redundant. We are all very proud of the original fans of the book; nobody is trying to hide the fact that you ""read it first"". Go ahead, keep it; it's your book. What could anybody possibly have done to satisfy the ""true"" fans of the book? I want to vomit when I hear these questions. The glory of a book is that it provides an active participation with the narrative in such a way that my perception of ""Marvin the Paranoid Android"" will never match yours! With this in mind, the only way to make any fan of this book happy would to make a movie that matches their own unique vision of this story. Movies always fall short because they offer ONE view of a story which, quite obviously, never matches an audiences. That is why we read books.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

That said, I feel that it was very good for me. It diverges quite a bit from the other forms of Hitchhiker's but that has always been the point. People who are familiar with the source material will either absolutely love it like I did or hate it as MJ Simpson did, whose scathing and voluminous review worried me greatly until I actually saw the movie. The importance is in the perspective and in one's own perspective. MJ Simpson focused more on what was not there from the other media and seemed too concerned to notice all the good ways things are done differently. The movie is less than two hours long and so cannot fit the entire book so there are abridged versions of things that are still true to the style of the late Douglas Adams, particularly the way Ford deals with Prosser and his men, and the new Babelfish entry.As for people who are unfamiliar with the source material, you probably won't like it as much as I did because in addition to the jokes I also laughed at the sly references to the TV Series and Starship Titanic computer game. However, the humor of the movie in of itself merits seeing it. It contains verbal humor, situational gags and pure slapstick humor as well.All in all, it accomplishes what it set out to do, translate Douglas Adams's vision into a movie and to me it may very well be the best movie ever made.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

The Guide was not used as much in the movie as it was in the book and the old movie. They also added too many characters. Trillian was a big let down, although she was still hot, she wasn't as smart as she was in the book. I didn't like how Zaphod looked. His southern accent,his second head where his neck should be and his third arm where his chest should be was awkward. WHat I did like was that in this one scene, the old Marvin robot was in line at the release place. At the end, Marvin gets shot in the head. I would have been deeply sad if they killed him. But he saves the day, with his personality! When they show the earth being created, the second time, its stunning. From mushrooms growing, to coloring a rock its fantastic. Mos Def(Ford) did a pretty good job. He may have been a rapper or is still one today, but he was still good.

916,lefthandblue,Hitchhiker's points out the difference between movies and novels.,9,30 April 2005,"Movies and novels are fundamentally different media and this work is one of the most dramatic examples of movies and novels of ""the same thing"" being different. I do not mean this as a criticism. The movie was fantastic. Arguably even better than the novel. The novel was a witty dry sort of humor (as the Brits do so well). The plot and characters were ridiculous and engaging through unpredictability and originality, and the whole thing was very lighthearted. Imagining the things described was a marvelous exercise. In contrast, the movie was full of complex, vibrant imagery and was more oriented toward the telling of a story than light joking, although elaborately set up puns were still present. And finally the emotional ride packed into two hours was that of the typical movie: A alarming beginning with issues to resolve and an ending. I cannot imagine reading the novel in two hours or Douglas Adams performing much calculated emotional manipulation of his reader (beyond the funny haha help I can't stop laughing sort). But the biggest difference is really one of imagination. When I read the novel, my imagination elaborated details onto the text. While I do have a good imagination, seeing the movie allowed me to see and hear how someone else imagined it...someone else with a very vivid imagination.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
917,ultimatehammer,"Well, thank God Douglas Adams is dead.",1,30 April 2005,"Really, it's terrible. The only quality element is what is read out of the book by the narrator--and in that case, why not just buy the book on cassette? The dialog is embarrassing, the action is sparse and sedated (almost all of the trailers' explosions were not in the film), and the characters were stripped of their charm, most notably in the case of Zaphod Beeblebrox.In the books, Zaphod is a dimwitted asshole, but he is not patently retarded. He is shrewd, calculating, and interesting. If I recall correctly, he is even at one point heroic--not to mention the fact that his less than ideal personality was actually a byproduct of his noble search for truth, as is revealed in the book. But the movie reduces him to a sort of belligerent Keith Richards crossed with Jar-Jar Binks. Moreover, Zaphod (as president, remember) is acted with a George Bush-impression accent. Now, this may go along with the late author's politics (not that he lived to see much of Mr. Bush). But whether or not one personally despises the man, one must agree that it is a sin to debase a movie that should have been held to such high standards with petty real-world politics when it has nothing to do with the book--and particularly not when it destroys a main character. It is the ultimate disrespect to Adams to replace his nuanced and engaging character with a cheap current-events joke.Arthur Dent is also a disappointment. Now, his character is much as it is in the first book--he becomes more interesting as they go along--but he doesn't say anything interesting. This is, of course, because the dialog in the movie is clichéd, immature, and asinine.The movie is a vastly Hollywoodized version of the story. The plot of course was truncated to fit the time slot, but this was only to be expected. It was the details that bothered me; everything had to be more 'appealing' to the masses. Now, Arthur does not fall in love until a later book, so they had to invent a happy ending with Trillian. And there wasn't enough diversity, so in to Ford being cast as black (don't get me wrong, though: Mos Def was one of the least disappointing actors, along with whoever was Slartibartfast), several characters were made female, such as the mice and Deep Thought, and a female vice president was added. The new Deep Thought was terrible--it should have been as it was described in the book, a sumptuously outfitted office with a HAL like computer interface.Furthermore, Trillian was a twit.No effort went into holding the script to the quality of the books--either Douglas didn't know how to write screenplays or his version was heavily modified (which I suspect was the case). In any instance where the book had an intelligent joke, the movie substituted an inferior replacement. For example, when in the book Ford convinced the wrecking crew manager Prosser to impede his own progress through clever (but not recorded) logic, the filmmakers had a lovely opportunity to stay true to the book while writing their own dialog. But instead of attempting to create the reasoning, which could have been very funny, Ford brought beer. That wasn't funny. Then they went to a pub to get a drink, which makes no sense because he'd just wheeled in an entire cart of the stuff. What you can see them trying to do is stick to the book when it's easy (sitting in a bar, pressing a button, reading passages out of the book) and shying away from the challenges. For example, there is a ""the girl's been captured scene"" added, where they have to fill out forms to rescue Trillian. This would have been a lovely time to add in the book's rocket-wielding Vogon commandos, or maybe the...let's just leave it as 'it was boring'.It was just bad.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

There was a great deal to enjoy, from the unique feel of the special effects to the exquisite comic timing and pace to the very fine and subtle political digs peppered throughout. I expect lovers of the U.S.'s current president will either be completely offended by the movie or just not get a lot of the jokes, but my partner and I were rolling at Sam Rockwell's characterization of the President of the Galaxy - great stuff. Mos Def did a great job with Ford Prefect, and it was delightful to hear Alan Rickman's voice issuing from Marvin - no better choice could have been made. The movie was entirely well-cast, well-acted and artistically satisfying. I think Douglas Adams would have been very pleased. In the wake of the ""Rings"" trilogy, few well-loved/cult favorites of this nature could truly compete, and it didn't feel like the producers of H2G2 were trying to accomplish such a lofty thing - they made a very enjoyable, high-quality movie that stayed near true to the spirit of the original story.

I'm not afraid to admit that I cried when I learned about Adams' death back in 2001. I'm equally unafraid to admit that I cried at the end of this movie. The final frame of Adams' face and the closing 'For Douglas' brought a tear to my eye. I can think of no better tribute to such a beloved man than the success with which this movie was realized. Like most fans, I knew that the movie would not be a literal adaptation of the book. I also knew that the basic screenplay was penned by Adams before his death and was simply polished by Karey Kirkpatrick. Mos Def was unbelievably perfect as Ford Prefect. The dead-pan/nonchalant delivery of most of Ford's line was supremely well executed. David Dixon was an excellent Ford, but his portrayal would not likely have worked in this film. Mos Def extrudes the aura of a man, both confident in his world view and slightly neurotic. He gives the impression of a (relatively) well adjusted man (Betelgeusian) that has enough of a rebellious flair to fly in the face of the galactic norm. Mos Def's Ford is that quirky friend/co-worker we all have that, despite our best attempts, just simply does not quite fit into the world. Someone who seems to know and understand the broad strokes of society, but cannot quite grasp their successful application. Ultimately, I loved the movie, and those whose efforts made it into reality have my undying gratitude. I can only hope that some pays me such great tribute when my time comes.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

So far I have seen reviews politely alluding to a sense of disappointment at the film's shortcomings, but as I wasn't paid to view/review it (and in fact had to pay myself to sit and endure it), I feel I've bought the right to bitch about its shortcomings.I'll keep it brief, friends. Here's the capsule review: it's essentially the ""Hitch Hiker's Guide"" Lite, in the style of ""Love Actually"". In addition to which, the producers have managed to extract all the gallows humour, absurdity and, let's face it, unremitting nastiness that made the radio plays and books live on so long.I won't say what it was about the ending that I found so lame, predictable and ultimately betraying to the original, as that might be viewed as a spoiler (though how this film could be spoiled further is unclear to me). You'll have to go and see it for yourself to find that out.In fact, I recommend that you do. That should put you off seeing any of the subsequent 4 movies which (I have no doubt) are lumbering towards production as you read this.Do yourself a favour and read the book from which this screenplay was so badly re-written: that, to me, is Adams' finest legacy to us.

The very beauty of Adams is the surreal subtext, the witty dialogue, and incalcitrant ironic machines and technology that just doesn't only not work, but points out the futility of trying in the first place. This film has NONE of these.Most of the film seemed to concern itself with running around slapstick 'Where did I last see my trousers' sub-Python style; Keystone Kops in Space but without the intelligent subversive dialogue of that {/irony} and Martin Freeman was totally wasted - he surprisingly wasn't funny; Mos Def did an OK job but wasn't believable (or funnily unbelievable); Zaphod was just annoying, not in a Betelgeuse ego-maniac annoying, just sub-Dubya-on-crack-I've-seen-a-few-Python-movies-d000d-schtick. Good to see Trillian have a better role and more of a protagonist; but not sure Zooey was the best person to do it.Best things were Simon Jones' cameo stealing the whole show; Marvin the original's appearance, Bill Nighy, and the improbability drive effects (SPOT: did anyone also see the picture of Douglas on the Heart of Gold blue 'china plate' design? Loads of spots like that - I was so bored I was looking for those!) Basically this is a film for those who have never seen, read or heard a single Adams productions - if they had they would be like me thinking of walking out - it really fights Star Wars 2 as one of the worst sci-fi movies of recent years, and I found bits of that entertaining, whereas H2G2 movie just was silly, and I wished I was drunk when i saw it because I might have found it slightly funny. Sadly.I'm also surprised at the good reviews here (did they see the same movie?) This gets not 42 but a very infinitesimal (1).",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

It was a pretty severe butcher job. It seems like they could not stick to the book's plot. Nearly all of the really clever one liners were left out and the bulldozer scene was ruined. It seems like the writers had to put their own mark on it and their ideas are pale by comparison to Douglas Adams. I really am angered and upset by the way this movie was done. Just another case of waiting till the author is dead and then cash in on the legacy they created. Next will be the ruin of Restaurant at the End of the Universe.

You get the HGTTG 2005 remake, which basically bastardizes the original story by impregnating it with a ghastly unoriginal love/rescue story, while simultaneously glossing over most of the parts of the original in a fast and oversimplified way that robs them of most if not all of their humor.If there were a real Hitchhiker's Guide entry about the American mainstream movie industry of Earth, I'll bet that it would probably read something like:These strange creatures seem to think that by testing a movie out on a group of trial subjects and observing their reactions, they can determine what elements of the movie have the most favorable effect on humans generally, and thus improve the general reaction to the film when it's released. However, what they don't realize is that through years of exposure to simplistic, unoriginal forms of entertainment and propaganda, combined with a public education system that seems to be designed to induce stupidity, hatred for learning, and blind obedience of authority figures, most of the test audience has already been conditioned to respond favorably to forms of entertainment that will only perpetuate ignorance in their society. An alternate hypothesis that many hold about this behavior of the mainstream American movie industry of Earth is that its product is designed purposefully to induce ignorance, archetypal personality within a certain range of archetypes defined by their effectively subservient nature to authority, and a general state of mind which results in the population being easy to control. These mentally softened creatures go about their lives making certain assumptions that have been implied countless times through mainstream media, education and propaganda outlets, despite the fact that many of these assumptions are simply not true in a scientific sense.

926,labitat,"Its from the ""B"" Ark...",3,1 May 2005,"Even with talented actors, a big budget, gifted special effects, and all the build up, I expected that it would be hard for them to beat the BBC miniseries, but I supposed they would come closer. Okay, so the 80 minute movie only covered the first book of the trilogy, not the first three books, covered by the miniseries in 180 minutes, but even a good two-hour movie would not have had to have cut out most of the funny bits I had expected (particularly from The Guide, itself, the proper star of the film). In fact, the more I recall the movie, the more hilarity I remember being left out of it.Visually, it's beautiful; everything you could want or expect from a big-screen adaptation of the work. The new actors are certainly up to the challenge; they did their best with what they had to work with. I simply find it difficult to believe that the same Doug Adams who wrote the books and said grace over the miniseries actually wrote this screenplay. It came so close, I suspect that if more Brits instead of Americans had been involved in the production, the result would have been infinitely funnier (and I'm an American saying that).Its a shame what they did to Mos Def, vs. the script the original David Dixon had to work with (and delivered so well); the character (Ford Prefect) lost so much in the translation. Alan Rickman's talent is more than up to the task of Marvin; its just a shame he wont be left parking cars for the next million years or so....",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

I almost walked out right there, but I was hoping for for something good.The story has a couple of the same plot lines, but a good 3/4ths of the movie has no basis in the book including a new villain, Arthur actually falls in love with Trillian, and they end up living happily ever after...Right....They actually keep the plot with the Tulips and the sperm whale falling from the atmosphere, but they don't elaborate any further into the story. There is a subplot involving a fictional villain, and a gun that he wants, so they spend a third of the movie going after this. The earth is actually finished by the planet-makers, and pulled back into existence.Right....I guess that Arthur spends the rest of his life hopping planets, but WITH Trillian, and it's because they choose too, and the Earth does not get blown up the second time...I know that they can't keep in line with all of a 6 book series into a single 2 hour movie, but they EASILY had enough material to make a very very good movie using it, but instead they just made up enough to make a version that I'm sure has Douglas Adams rolling in his grave, and mark my words, that is the only reason this movie ever got made.If you haven't read the books, read them, they're top-notch, 10/10 The movie, if you haven't read the books, 4/10 if you have..... 1/10",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

The Book and television series are sci-fi comedies, and truly great ones at that. This was a horror movie. In it the universe's greatest script is murdered by executives at some earth based movie company intent on finding all truly fresh and original ideas and pulverising them into a mush of tripe. The WORST character in the film by far is Helen Mirram who plays the voice of the computer Deep Thought. In the TV series one of the great moments was when Deep thought utters the answer to the ""the question"" of life the universe and everything. The build up to this , the many jokes that surrounded it in the book, and the tone of deep thought talking of constructing a computer that HE was not fit to tie the shoe laces of, was all lost in the dramatic murdering of the best science fiction comedy script that has ever been written.The only redeeming qualities were Steven Fry who was an excellent, and Bill Baily.If I had my way the cast and crew would be sent to the point in time just after the restaurant at the end of the universe, and the directors lined up and shot with the point of view gun held buy Douglas Adams's fan base.I gave this film 3 as it is the Third worst film in the universe. The second being the Epic ""Party Political Broadcast the motion picture"", from the planet Sidyol, which is inhabited by dull Ant like beings who can unfortunately talk.

Don't Buy a Ticket!,3,2 May 2005,"Having grown up a Hitchhiker's and Douglas Adams fan, I was incredibly excited when I saw the previews to the new adaptation of The Guide during the Super Bowl. I was more excited when I heard that Douglas Adams had worked on the original screenplay before he died in 2001. And I was even more excited when I saw some of the trailers on the internet. However, my excited ended about five minutes into the movie when I realized that the sophisticated British comedy that had made the radio play, TV series, and books such a cult classic, and enlivened my youth, had been replaced by a droll Americanized comedic routine of slapstick and one-liners. I can honestly say this is the worst movie adaptation I have ever seen, and I have seen some bad movie adaptations, Starship Troopers immediately comes to mind. This new Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy may capture the attention of a new audience who will think they are ""the biggest Hitchhiker's fans (he! he!)"" until they read the book and realize it is ""like completely nothing like the movie you know, I mean they really didn't get anything right in the book at all."" The love story between Arthur and Patricia/Trillian is faked, Arthur having a sudden character shift faked, Mos Def would have been an excellent Ford if they had given him a good script to work with (in fact, if you would have given the new Arthur and new Ford the old script people would have rolled in the aisles), and the new Zaphod needs to be shot in both heads. Really though, what is up with the Pez Dispenser head, Zaphod's heads should be side by side because he never...oh wait, that's in the book and not in this terrible movie. As the Guide says, ""Don't Panic!"" But don't waste $15 or 19.5 euros or whatever galactic currency you are using to see this movie.

The added love story between Arthur and Trillian was explored too much considering the intended style of the story. The acting was wooden at best and not in the ""over-the-top"" fashion of the original, with the exception of Zaphod. The special effects were great, including the Vogons, but they were not enough to carry the story alone. The story stops short of the miniseries and we never get to Milliways.

The acting was mediocre, Trillian was terrible and Zaphod was an unrecognizable catastrophe. There were strange new and unnecessary story arcs which took up time that could have been filled with Douglas Adam's Brilliant dialog. He was a skit writer, he wasn't concerned with the overall story and that seems to be the only thing that the filmmakers were interested in. The only up side was some of the visuals. The Heart of Gold is magnificent-looking, Marvin is humorous as a midget and the Vogons are very well done, but even the visuals give out towards the end when the budget seems to have run out. The absence of explanation of many aspects of the film is baffling to new-comers and frustrating for fans. Fans, don't waste your money.

For a film and one with such special effects a budget must be considered. I have the original story on 4 videos so something had to be cut.Actually, a lot was cut.

The actors were great in it, visually I loved all of the elements. I thought, visually, the movie is wonderful. It was like they were pulling mental images straight out of Adam's head. I have absolutely no complaint about the look or the actors, which I all thought where good.What I didn't like was the... how do you say? It involves paper, and letters, and spell correct... Oh ya, I HATE the script! Imagine for a second if somebody took the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (the real book, not the fictional guide), and tossed it into a blender. Then they took the biggest pieces out of the blender and put them through the shredder. Then they took whatever was left over from the shredder, rolled joints with it, smoked all of them well urinating on Douglas Adam's grave, and finally took whatever legible lines were left and pasted them into somebody else's script.Basically, this isn't the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. This was a sappy, slap-stick Hollywood-style blockbuster, containing all of your typical Hollywood movie clichés (Including the lame Love Story, Yay!). All of the characters are there, and the actors all seem to do a reasonable job. But all of that great writing, the amazing dry British humor, has been removed to make space for a lot of vapid Hollywood dibble. All that's left are a few snippets from the book, hastily crammed into somebody else's movie... and A lot of special effects!

That's not actually the problem. It's the how. This is not a comedy. It's an action film with slapstick. Douglass Adams' story is a social satire. This one is just some plot elements without much comedic timing. Most of the actors seem to be taking events seriously instead of being able to make them funny.

Great in the late 70s - by 2005 too clichéd to be a central joke.) 2) Being based on a series of half hour shows the structure is episodic and does not transfer well to one 2 hour film - The film tries to resolve this but it doesn't always work. 3) In the end ... it just - well - runs out of steam.However ... 1) A good central performance from Freeman 2) The effects are both effective and very well used 3) Some of those lines are fantastic and 4) The premise of a Guide for intergalactic Hitchikers remains brilliant!,The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

I haven't gotten my hands on the more recent radio adaptations and I don't live and breathe the books though I continue to reread them (plus Young Zaphod, 2 dirk Gently's, the Meaning of Liff and Starship Titanic). Bottom line for the preface is I like the books and the TV version (because it stuff to the books).

Can anyone explain the omission of the 15 seconds it would take to show how the babblefish is the perfect argument against the existence of god? The whole thing seemed rushed and contrived -- the galaxy has no plot, it just is, but this movie yearned for plot and forced one down my throat.I now want to sit through the whole TV series again just to remind myself of what a truly bewildered Arthur, and aloof Ford, a zany Zaphod (though they did keep ""He's just zis guy, you know"") and an inaccessible Trillian should be. And as much as I like Alan Rickman, I prefer the original droning of Marvin. Even Eddie seemed throw-away.So I stay sad.

The alien characters are instantly forgettable (except Zaphod who Sam Rockwell brings to life well), the aliens that destroy Earth are the supposed demolition crew and yet they then become a sort of police force sent to kill the one's who took Zaphod hostage... why, I thought they just destroyed planets as their job, their purpose is vague other than to setup the ""destroyed earth plot device"". Other ""funny"" aliens like the one's that invented underarm deodorant before the wheel are barely even seen. The planet factory has about 2mins screen time.Bill Nighey's character is supposed to be ashamed of his name.... why?, his name, Slartybardfast doesn't even mean anything. It couldn't be taken as rude, there's no double entendre just no wit whatsoever and this is a good example of flat jokes.There is also no closure for the characters. Zaphod loses one of his heads and has to get a gun for a pointless John Malkovich character, but he never delivers the gun and never regains his missing head. Maybe he just did't care or maybe the Director/Editors screwed with the ending.And correct me if i'm wrong but isn't a big part of the story supposed to be about the ""Number 42"" question and answer? Everyone just kinda forgot about that did they?One last moan! Alan Rickman (great as he is) - is woefully miscast as Marvin. His voice is sooo distinctive that it distracts from the fact Marvin is meant to be a robot; the voice just sounds detached for want of a better word.BTW, I am NOT a fan of the book as I have never read it, so I am NOT some fan-boy who is annoyed at some betrayal.

They ruined the one great thing about books and made up a pointless romance between Arthur and Trillion that wasn't necessary and just distracted from the real plot. Poorly done. They tied up all the ends neatly and made it a beautiful blockbuster high budget movie and destroying all the character it could have had.

The point of the book was it was blown up we'd just have to deal for the following books until Arthur and Ford get sent back in time.the only reason i don't consider it a waste of money was the adorable opening song. i'd recommend paying 8$ just to see the dolphins.,The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
944,lporter-4,An insult,1,3 May 2005,"Douglas Adams is turning in his grave.This film bears likeness to The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy in the same way as Raiders of the Lost Ark does to Hamlet. Don't go and see it, if you like the radio series/ book or original TV series. This is not the Hitchhikers guide to the galaxy. Its not even the same storyline. They have completely missed the humor of the book, whoever remade this has no understanding of wit and sarcasm. Were they American? I'm guessing due to the abominable script that they were.For some reason they thought it would be a good idea to invent an entirely new storyline, a love story, this did not happen and was completely unnecessary..I am appalled and outraged by this nonsense and want my 7 back from Bray Cinema.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

And I was pretty bored for most of it, to be honest.The problem is the script. There aren't many jokes and most of them aren't funny. The plot also makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. Not ""oh, there are a few plot holes"" no sense. More ""What the fudge is going on? Why are they here? Why did he say x? But why didn't she do y?"" kind of no sense.On a positive note, the production design is fantastic; an excellent demonstration of why CGI is best used sparingly and in conjunction with traditional effects.All four of my stars are for the production design. I would honestly give the script zero. I wouldn't expect anyone to enjoy this film unless they're extremely easily amused and suffer from attention deficit disorder.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

Although it roughly sticks to the plot line it has changes which a) were meant to make the movie critics happy or b) was aimed at the US audience only After about a third of the movie it doesn't bother skipping back to 'book story telling mode' anymore - one of the features which made the real reading of the book so fun. The semi romantic happy ending is also not true to the book. But of course, how else do you capture the attention of an audience who hasn't bothered reading the book than with a 'chase' theme and a romantic sub plot.

947,gregory_91,Failed to live up to the series or book,2,3 May 2005,"Just home from watching the movie in a packed movie theatre. Sorry, the movie just doesn't work. I heard one person in the whole theatre give an occasional snicker, the rest of us sat in silence.In the series, the main character was the book itself and it's tongue in cheek viewpoint, it made only a couple of rare direct appearances in the movie. The minor players in the book/series who provided the rest of the humour in the original were completely glossed over, I guess there is only so much time in a movie format, but it left the movie with no substance.Important background was missed from most of the gags, unless you had read the book/seen the series, they would have made no sense, if you had, then you'd heard it before, and better presented.While state of the art at the time, the graphics of the guide in the series are somewhat dated, but then, thats what you would expect from a cheap and nasty publication like the Hitchhikers Guide. I think the new graphics added little to the effect. Speaking of the effects, while the animation of the Vogon ship was pretty good, it wasn't anything special and added nothing to the storyline, just a gratuitous sequence that wasted time that could have been better spent on plot development. On the other hand, the Magrathean shop floor, while OK, failed to grab me as it should have. I think for instance the intro to the Red Dwarf 1st series does a much better job of impressing sheer scale at a fraction of the price. Again we spent a fair chunk of time showing off graphics when the storyline was lacking.Anyways, in my opinion and by it's reaction 98% of the audience I saw it with, save your money and see something else.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
948,nick-865,A die-hard fan says STAY AWAY,1,3 May 2005,"I've been a fan of hitchhikers since it first aired on BBC radio. I've bought the books, CDs, videos, DVDs, towels and games. If I were ever to appear on Mastermind, h2g2 would be my specialist subject (I'd fail completely on the general knowledge, but that's a different story).There, that's that out. I love Hitchhiker's.So, after carefully avoiding all the reviews and news stories, four of us made our way to the local cinema for a preview screening last week. My god, we wish we hadn't. Since I've seen the film, I've read the reviews to find that some people have said Douglas Adams would have been happy with the way the film turned out, or that die-hard fans would approve. Let me tell you right now that this fan doesn't approve and would be very surprised indeed if Douglas Adams had thought the film a masterpiece.It's clear to me (and to my three companions) that the film is an incredibly dumbed-down version of the other versions of the story. It makes no reference to the science and geeky nature of the originals and turns the whole thing into a love story.Hitchhiker's, a love story?In all its other incarnations, Hitchhiker's is a comment on society, a stab at authority and an extrapolation of ideas. It is not a love story. Even when there was a love interest, it was played down and was definitely background material.Whereas, the film... Forget the intellectual humour. In fact, forget any sort of humour. Forget the sideways look at society. It's a love story. That's it. Even this, I could put up with (after all, they did make it to get the audiences in), but the disjointed plot line and the ludicrous ending make it a story not worth seeing at all.So, if you like dumbed-down love stories, fine, go see it. Whatever you do though, don't rubbish the radio/books/video if you've only seen the film.But.... do yourself a favour, read the books, listen to the radio series and AVOID THIS FILM LIKE THE PLAGUE.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
949,StevieFlyBoy,Empty,5,3 May 2005,"I'm not going to go into a deep review of the film but wanted to add a few comments.The HHGG has worked well in different formats and I don't think it was ever going to be suited to film, as much as I wished it would. The crew have done a pretty good job of bringing it together, but I just felt it lacked a lot.The jokes from the book were cut short so that they weren't actually jokes, the cast and acting was generally OK - but only OK (apart from Zaphod), the story jumped about and felt clunky and it was generally OK :( I've read plenty of reviews about the film prior to seeing it and I had hoped they would help manage my expectations, but I found that the film wasn't funny, didn't flow and would be confusing if you didn't know the background.My apathetic summary would be that, if you've got the time - see it and make your own mind up. I for one feel a bit cheated that the film isn't anywhere near what it could have been and will never get a chance again.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
950,wildbagel,"Ouch. Who casted this, anyway?",2,3 May 2005,"I have actually read the first two books (and plan to read the other 3 later on), and i thought it was an awful movie. My main problem was with the casting. While Martin Freeman did a fabulous job as Arthur Dent, Sam Rockwell butchered the part of Zaphod. Anyone who has even read a few chapters about Beeblebrox knows that he was not a vain priss, but simply full of himself and conceited. Rockwell played the part like a blond Elvis. The general feel of the movie was silly and outrageous. Again, I appreciated the book much better on this point. While many of the explanations and descriptions in Adams's books are ridiculous, they are written with a sort of ""straight-faced humor."" They are not outrageous or goofy, but the movie was exactly that. In my opinion, this detracted from the overall impressiveness of the film, comparing it to some slapstick comedy (although there was very little physical action). My final criticism is the departure from the book's plot. It seemed that after the first 20 minutes they just threw out the rest of the story and went on with whatever they wanted to do. There were many added elements, and even excluding Hollywood's mandatory love story, they composed at least half of the movie. I know you need to add things to convert a movie to screen, but that's disgusting. If you haven't read the books, you may appreciate this movie. But I believe that the main things you will appreciate about this movie are the things from the book, which were done better in the book anyway.

Although no film can duplicate a book, I thought the movie caught much of the spirit and irreverence of the books. It was wonderful to see religion being poked fun at and to see a reckless president of the universe who closely resembled the current reckless and inept president of the U.S. My suspicion is that is the main reason reviews haven't been more glowing. Luckily, word of mouth seems to be winning out over media propaganda.

I am so upset about it i just cant talk anymore!!! Where was all the talk with Marvin? The ships computer? The exploration of the Vogons Ship! And what was all that in the middle about the Vogons planet? have i had a substandard copy of the book and missed some pages? OK so i understand that they have to make the film appealing to the customers but wasn't the original script/book enough for them. It was good enough o keep millions of fans happy for the years before the film so why change what was obviously a jolly god idea in the first place.As for Zaphods head? A major disappointment. In the original Zaphods extra head was so laid back and mellow and this thing was just a freak, annoying and not worth the effort that was put into it. Please please please would anyone who thinks i am so wrong about all of this let me know and if you agree.....doubly-so!!

958,speechman74,Don't Panic Over This Guide,8,4 May 2005,"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is a wholly remarkable film. The story of The Guide starts with a house on a terrible, stupid Thursday. The protagonist, Arthur Dent, (Martin Freeman, from the original BBC series The Office) could never get the ""hang of Thursdays"", and this particular Thursday by all means is no exception. Amazingly, this is also the day that Arthur's house is to be torn down by a bulldozer. By some odd coincidence or perhaps on account of someone mistaking an order to destroy Earth for an autograph request, this is the same Thursday that an alien race known as Vogons plan to demolish the Earth to make way for a new hyperspace express route. With the help of a friend, Ford Prefect (Mos Def), Arthur manages to escape Earth and begin a most fascinating adventure through the galaxy.There are those out there who have panned the film, lamenting that it is such a radical departure from Douglas Adams' original concept. The only problem with such critics is that they neglect to understand that Douglas Adams viewed The Hitchhiker's story as a work in progress. Just as Ford Prefect's career requires him to do field research in order to keep The Guide up to date, Douglas Adams felt it necessary to continuously tinker with and update his work. Much of what is new in this film might very well be of Douglas Adams' own design, and some of what is left out might be equally intentional. I say all of this knowing full well that it is a careless assumption for fans to feel that this is such a radical departure. The beginning of the film is quite faithful to the book, but after that, there are parts that are completely different and even a part that borrows from a subsequent book in the series. Adams himself is reported to have said that his own book was noted for a very long beginning and a short ending, or something to that effect.This film does a nice job of tying some of the loose plot elements together, so that those who are otherwise totally unfamiliar with the book can follow the action. This film still has very much the same flavor as the book and Adams' uncanny wit is left intact, in spite of some of the bits being left out. Absent for example is The Guide's entry on Earth: which is to simply read ""Mostly Harmless"". However, everything from the awful Vogon poetry, the infamous whale, the Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster, the Babel fish, Slartibartfast, Deep Thought, Marvin (voiced by the amazing Alan Rickman) the Infinite Improbability Drive, Arthur deciding to lie down in front of the bulldozer and even the answer to life, the universe, and everything are all here. What else could you possibly ask for in a movie? I was also delighted to see at some point in the film, though I won't mention when, the inclusion of one of my favorite Guide entries; which is all about careless talk. Suffice to say, you will want to stay for the closing credits. If all these elements mean nothing to you, you will soon find out when you see the film. If you are familiar with these concepts and you are among those who have already seen this film, and these aspects still mean nothing to you, then evidently you never truly appreciated The Guide in the first place.I understand that parts of the film remind some people of the old television series. I saw some of the old BBC television series and I would tend to agree. At times, this film has a rather B movie feel, but then again, so did the series. The film preserves some of that for the benefit of those who remember the series, but also includes many of the more modern special effects we have come to appreciate recently, for the benefit of those who like that sort of thing better. I didn't realize that the song, ""Journey of the Sorcerer"" was featured in the original radio and television series. The Jim Henson team did an outstanding job creating the look of the Vogons and the special effects used in the battle scenes as well as the set design for the spaceship Heart of Gold were absolutely brilliant. The film contains wonderful surprises, often with hilarious effect. I possibly laughed loudest when our favorite hitchhikers suddenly found themselves feeling a bit plushy. Of course, the whole tone of the film is set in motion right away and to great effect by what might just possibly be an Academy Award winner for Best Original Song. ""So Long and Thanks for all the Fish"", as noted by the film's director, Garth Jennings, has a very Cole Porter feel to it. You no more think you are about to watch a satirical sci-fi film than a smash hit Broadway show. The melody of the song is cleverly ironic when you consider the lyrics. When this song follows Stephen Fry's opening narrative, which is taken by the way, straight from Douglas Adams' book, and when it is juxtaposed with scenes of dolphins leaping through the water, true fans are immediately put at ease about the prospects of the film they are about to see. At the end of the film, this opening bit will still stand out and you will find yourself humming and whistling the tune without knowing it.The film is by no means perfect, but neither are the third most intelligent creatures on Earth. If you liked the book, you'll like the movie. If you liked the official commemorative towel, you'll like another official commemorative towel in case the first one gets a bit too damp. If you like the film, see the film again, so that we might all get to see The Restaurant at the End of the Universe.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

Hehehe...Well to add my opinion to the masses, I put my name into the hat of those book lovers who thought the film was less than a complete disaster, but also failed to live up to expectations.Some of the plot changes were actually not terrible in my opinion. I kind of expected that to make it palatable as a film it would need a thematic thread sewn into it. I wasn't repulsed by that theme being the botched and then renewed relationship between Arthur and Trillian. I thought the notion of being willing to take chances and be adventurous in order to be happy in life was handled well. I didn't like, however, that the guide was less a tool by which people survived in the galaxy on a minimal budget, and more an ancillary reference to throw a lot of made-up words at the audience. Ford's role in it was also glossed over. It's the title of the movie, and yet it seemed... unimportant.I also liked the stunning visual effect of the film. I just wish it had been as dramatic visually throughout, instead of only in two or three key moments. Magrathea's showroom, for one, needed to be a little showier than it was, a couple samples like stuffed animals in a display case, completely inconsistent with the staggeringly lucrative business it was supposed to have been.What I was repulsed by was that the dialogue was hard to follow and the comedic timing was choppy. Some good punch lines really got de-emphasized by erratic accenting (the bar scene at the beginning) and/or poor editing (the description of the religion of the coming of the great white handkerchief was delivered like a toss-away joke, so it failed to properly set up the scene at the religious mass which had some very funny lines in it).I also thought that many of the the choices of new versus old comedic material were poorly made. Some very clever bits got left out (i.e. the side effects of traveling in improbability, the debate between the scientists and the philosophers about the advantages and disadvantages of knowing the answer and the question, or the problems caused by Genuine People Personalities), and some very intellectually boring ones substituted (i.e. things that spring up out of the ground and slap you if you have an idea).I would have liked to see the length pushed up a bit in order to preserve some of the better, more intellectually clever scenes from the book. If the wit of the book had been able to shine through moreso than it did, I don't think folks would have minded a two hour film. They'd have been too busy laughing to notice it was that long.Ahhh well. Someone in another thread said it best... it's very unlikely that a film adaptation is going to ever mesh with YOUR artistic impression of the book.An almost, but not completely, entirely disappointed... -Rob.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

I would stick with the TV series.About the only inspired choices were Alan Rickman for Marvin, though the robot looked like a kids toy, Stephen Fry as the Book and Bill Nighy as Slartibartfast. It is a shame, however, that none of these people were allowed to use their talents to the full. One would also wonder why the book itself, previously overflowing with all manner of nonsense and humour, was reduced to a sterile copy of the original. With todays graphic capability this was unforgivable.I will however give a nod to some of the effects which were quite pleasant to see. Especially in the factory floor of Magrathea.

963,thaisteve18,Sleep inducing,3,5 May 2005,"Why don't people realise that books, films and radio are different media that work completely differently. What is great as a book can fail miserably when transferred to film. That's why so many films scripts deviate so much from the original books.So all this discussion as to how faithful the movie is to the book is ridiculous. I've heard the audio play, seen the TV show and read three books. I like Adam's writing and sardonic wit. But I went to see the film with an open mind. I actually prefer an original treatment anyway.Taking this film as a standalone piece of audio/visual entertainment however I found it unfunny, rushed, confusing and dull. It reminded me so much of Baron Munchhausen by Terry Gilliam which was too chaotic and incomprehensible.Unfortunately with HHTG they tried to film a whole book which has too many ideas to digest in 100 or so minutes. The TV series succeeded where the film failed because it covered the book in three hours and the pace was considerably slower. The film sped along so quickly, flitting from set to set and introducing so many new concepts and characters that after a while it became such a muddle that I lost interest.Also, as hard as I tried to concentrate on the dialogue, it was all too muffled to understand apart from Stephen Fry and anyone not having read the books would have been absolutely in the dark. Comedy is one of the hardest things to do in film and depends on three main aspects - good script, timing and performances.

The best bit was the dolphins leaving,the best performances were the 2 voices: Marvin and The book, but then the actors have oodles of talent. I met 2 groups of friends at the movie and we all felt we had wasted time and money. The 2 BBC versions are far superior and did much more justice to the books. It is difficult to meet the guidelines here as there is little to add. Marvin was too cute,the gorgons were too likable, Trillian was too ordinary... but the dolphins were great, and I did not like the irritating way the plot was given away too soon.Sorry folks, the tickets are a waste of money.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

The idea that Arthur Dent's home was knocked down for a freeway bypass while Earth was demolished for the same has always been funny. Hitchhiking, with an insane book, is very sixties. Vorgons, dolphins and mice add to the insanity. But to understand the jokes, you had to have read the book. Like why a towel? The pacing is inconsistent; slow then fast then slow. Some other things are not quite as the books, but Adams changed things all the time. I missed Ford convincing Prosser to lie down in front of the bulldozer. I missed some other more subtle jokes - but, as a rewrite, mostly by Adams, it was good. Pacing was a bit off - but for a British film, this was normal. Arthur Dent was less consistent - either as a hero or a whiner. Trillian has a much bigger part (and Zooey Deschanel is much prettier than Arthur deserves! And in his TOWEL!) Ford Prefect almost disappears - and so he did in the book. Zaphod dominates - and provides a good example of a guy that men hate and too many women initially love. His second head is badly done. The plot has weaknesses, but the original books were chaotic so...

But after seeing it, i will bow to the wonder that is The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy! A real tribute to my god and personal savior, Douglas Adams. Contains all his humor and more, and loses nothing (nothing serious, anyway), in the transition from page to screen. Granted, Zaphod's head was a little weird (it was Definitely described as being on his shoulder in the book), but still, his two heads WERE there. The adding of scenes not contained in the book makes sense, since they A) were in the humor and style of Adams; B) made up for the fact that at least 40%-50% of the book is commentary and narration and therefore not easy to translate to screen (and likely boring if it is ALL made narration in the movie), and C) DOUGLAS ADAMS WROTE THE SCREENPLAY!

972,Andross-2,Mostly Hilarious,8,7 May 2005,"When I first heard about this movie, I was ecstatic. I thought, ""Yay, one of my favorite book series is going to be a movie"". Then I started seeing the casting... Sam Rockwell and Mos Def were really out of left field. I began to seriously doubt that this movie could actually be good. I went into the theater expecting to see a great story just ruined by Hollywood. My expectations were quite wrong.Now, most of the story has been changed and such to allow it to fit. One thing that will and has definitely annoyed the crap out of DNA fans is that most of the jokes from his book have been left out. Well, not entirely. The basis of almost all the jokes are there, they've just been abbreviated... and not just a little. For Example:*SPOILER WARNING*Please do not read on if you don't want parts of the movie ruined.The dolphin joke is never directly mentioned. Briefly, as Earth is being destroyed, we see a newspaper with the headlines ""Dolphins Disappear"". Funny if you read the book, not so funny if you haven't.This movie really doesn't seem like it was meant to be a direct translation of The Guide, like the old BBC show was, but more of a new story, based mostly on the guide. The majority of the new, added jokes aren't really all that funny. The movie becomes hilarious by pretty much riding on the hilarity of the guide, little things remind you of parts in the book. You start laughing, but not at the movie. Now, there are some really funny new additions, but on the whole, the movie just disappoints Guide fans.Now, if you've never read The Guide, see this movie.

973,zoehemes,Earth's guide to this awful excuse for a movie.,2,7 May 2005,I awaited the new hitchhikers guide to the galaxy film with great anticipation only to be thoroughly disappointed. If you have enjoyed reading the books and/or the TV series then you will not like this new version. There isn't enough detail and too much random stuff has been added on. I have only given this film 2 out of 10 because although there were some funny moments in the film I just don't feel it was anything close to being as good as the books/TV series. The TV show may have had some awful special effects but at least it stuck to the book's storyline.

For me, someone who cherishes his ""trilogy"" of Hichhiker books, this movie was both exciting and disappointing. It was exciting to see Hollywood treat the story of Arthur Dent with respect: the special effects are well done, the characters are true to form, and the movie was properly marketed. Unfortunately, the writers apparently didn't believe in the books enough to leave the main story alone: they have added a character, a scene, and a love story that didn't exist in the books. For someone who has never heard of the Hitchhiker stories before, this movie should be an eye-opening experience; for those of us who love the books, expect a well-made yet somewhat disappointing movie.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

I was completely bored, which took me by surprise. For a movie based on a completely hilarious book, the humor was gutted and left on the abattoir floor. I laughed more while reading the first chapter of the book than I did during this entire fiasco. From the opening song, which was so completely unnecessary and just beat the dolphin joke to a bloody pulp, to the unexplained characters introduced to advance the ""plot"" and then dismissed, this was just a mess. Douglas Adams' humor apparently just does not translate into American English. Mos Def? Who the hell is Mos Def and why is he in this movie? Ford Prefect, claiming to be from Guilford, with an American accent? Even the most dense Englishman wouldn't fall for that. Right off the bat I didn't buy into the casting. Sam Rockwell's choice to play Zaphod as a thinly veiled (I think) imitation of George W. Bush/cum rock star was an odd choice and not a successful one.

977,placebo_domino,"In places clever, in places visually stunning... In places dire and incomplete",4,8 May 2005,"The HHGTTG Film opens with a concept lifted straight from the original rendering of the story. Stephen Fry (not quite Peter Jones, but brilliant as ""the book"" nonetheless"") narrates the entire Earth population of dolphins leaving the planet before the destruction of the earth (Set to an annoying ""theme song"". The film then cuts to Arthur Dent in his house, and soon lying in front of a bulldozer. Unfortunately this is where the film begins to lose its credibility. The script for the first 10 minutes is very similar to the original radio series, but neither Martin Freeman nor Mos Def have the ability to pull of the lines convincingly. Whilst both quite good choices of actor for their roles, it was unfair to give such a direct comparison to the superior Simon Jones and Geoffrey McGivern so early into the film. Mos Def drops a few lines directed at those familiar to the story, however they are so offhand that they seem just an afterthought to the script.Fortunately once the Vogons arrive, things begin to improve. The depiction of the Vogons is probably the most successful aspect of the whole film, voiced by the League of Gentlemen. Until we meet the characters of Trillian and Zaphod. I have no complaints at all with choosing a black actor to play Ford (though Mos Def is altogether too Cat-like to seem an original character, and doubtless took some inspiration from Danny John Jules' lead), however the choice of actress for Trillian is completely unsuitable for the part. She is neither strong-willed, independent or even obviously intelligent. She seems just a pathetic love-sick young girl. Casting Sam Rockwell as Zaphod need not have been the disaster it proved to be. The Film's Zaphod is neither cool nor funny, he just comes across as an idiot. It is unlikely he would be capable of delivering some of Zaphod's best lines convincingly. There is no way Sam Rockwell will ever have difficulty seeing over his pelvis. Presumably the budget didn't stretch to giving Zaphod two heads all the time, so his second is tucked away under his chin (and subsequently removed, kept as a hostage and forgotten).Visually the film is on the whole very good. The rendering of the Infinite Improbability drive operating is very good, particularly a scene where all the characters are turned to wool. However they could have done with using Adam's actual description of the ship, rather than a strange ball shape. Deep Thought is another tragedy; voiced by a woman and looking more like a children's television character than the second greatest computer ever created. At this point director, Jennings, decided to cut out the brilliant scene with the philosophers, replacing it with two small girls (who turn out to be mice). Marvin comes across as more pathetic than manically depressed, and his appearance is less than appropriate. Bill Nighy seems to be only actor capable of being convincing. He is brilliant as Slartibartfast, getting the mannerisms perfect.The storyline takes an unexpected turn when the ""point of view gun"" is introduced as a side-plot. This wouldn't be a problem if the storyline was concluded, but by the end of the film the gun (the reason for the characters visiting Margaretha) is forgotten and the film is tied up half an hour before it could/should have been with the line ""Let's go to the restaurant at the end of the universe"".On the whole a poor attempt at visualising Adam's genius. However as a film in its own right elements stand out, and some additions (tho not many) are beneficial to the film. Of course the main points of humour are those lifted directly from the original works (radio play and books). Disappointing for those who know and love the story, just another slightly funny but mostly mundane sci-fi movie for those who don't. The last image we see is the Heart of Gold turning into Douglas Adams face.

978,soyuz9,Needs a little re-tooling,6,8 May 2005,"OK, so I was able to not criticize the movie too much as I was watching it, but here are the sticking points, good and bad:Martin Freeman did a terrific job playing Arthur, though from the bookyou get the impression that he is a little older and a little more tired by the way he acts.Somebody destroyed Ford Prefect's character completely. Ford is supposed to be a clown and a slight playboy. Mos Def would have been great, but either the directing or his own interpretation screwed up Ford's character. (They missed a defining moment in the movie where Ford convinces the head of the demolition crew to take Arthur's place in front of the bulldozer...)They left-out the ""green pieces of paper"" intro.... bad, bad, bad.I honestly can't remember for sure, but I'm pretty certain Trillian was British. They need to use British actors for British characters (and that is pretty much everyone in the book). Alan Rickman was a TERRIFFFFFIC choice for Marvin.They left-out Eddie singing ""You'll Never Walk Alone"" as the missilescome toward the Heart of Gold.I have no memory of the Point-of-View gun, but if it's in the book then it was given a much more important role than it should have been.The love triangle,...... oh alright, but they need to focus on Adams's humor rather than the stupid triangle.The bureaucracy of the Vogons was done very well.Humma Kavula?? Again, I might just be forgetting a character in the original book, but I don't remember any character of that name being as important as the movie made him.All in all, good show.

My negative comment is due to the fact that God and the meaning of life are mocked in this movie. There is also very little ""intelligent"" plot to the movie. There is a lot of action (falling on your face kind). And a bit of romance thrown in. If you look hard, you will find one good piece of humor from a mindless computer (suffering from a mindless diversion we all share).

985,Sunrunners_Fire,Unbelievable......and NOT in a good way.....,1,11 May 2005,"Well I must be in a real minority here, having read some of these other reviews.I love the Hitchhiker's Guide books and the old series. It's funny, it's unique - it's the Guide. What more can you say? I was so looking forward to seeing this, I was overjoyed they'd finally got it together and made a film. It could have been utterly brilliant; staggering; amazing; and most of all, funny.But  there's always a but, isn't there  personally, I thought the film utterly, absolutely and irredeemably SUCKED.If there was a new writer brought in to make the screenplay more ""coherent""then I hope he/she didn't get paid because they didn't do their job It jumped all over the place with no explanations which is fine if you've read the books and makes things difficult to understand if you haven't. Half of it didn't make any sense. It was dull, embarrassing and disjointed; it seemed to be another case by American film-makers of, ""hey, who cares about the plot, we got good effects and a HUGE budget!"". The factory floor at Magrathea was amazing; the woollen dollies were funny. But apart from that, I feel like I wasted my money and time watching the huge mistake this film has become.Yes, Alan Rickman as the voice of Marvin was a good choice; Martin Freeman as the long-suffering Arthur was good casting. But that's it. Zooey Deschanel was as wooden as they come; Mos Def was useless as Ford and much though I think Sam Rockwell is a good actor, he didn't do Zaphod justice and that's because of a crap script rather than his abilities. And as for Humma Kuvala  what the hell was all that about?! If they'd kept in some of the original and fantastic material from the book there'd have been no need to add in lame and useless plot devices. I find it hard to believe that Douglas Adams (may he RIP) actually had any part in writing the screenplay that I watched last night.Personally I was dying to see this film; I feel cheated and wish I hadn't bothered. I certainly won't be going to see The Restaurant at the End of the Universe (which I'm sure will appear in due course) because it will more than likely be another colossal mistake, just like this one.

I don't think I laughed out loud once the entire movie. Nor did most of the audience.Check out the original TV series instead.

990,teresat-1,It's 2005 People,8,11 May 2005,"Well, here are my professional film opinions, so don't read any further unless you plan to pay me :PPPPPP For me, the original Hitchhiker's Guide is a point of historical reference and a piece of British culture that has always made me feel like a Colonist sharing culture with the Motherland. On the TV show I loooved the variety of goofy British accents and Trish McMillan/Trillian with a definite Canadian accent. Stirred memories of shows with overly-obvious deadpan British remarks still creep up on me and makes me laugh at the most inopportune times. I loved the repetition of the theme song. It announced ""Come close. Be quiet. The show is on."" I adored the actual Hitchhiker Guide's perverted narration and constant storyline roundup displayed in rudimentary drawing's on the Guide's monitor in the corner of your tiny TV screen (come up for air) (take a breath). Everything was overstated and overstated again. The costumes and sets were low-budget and very campy. Now, as I'm reading the books, I can reply the old TV actor voices reading the lines. Those old-fashioned BBCisms made the series so endearing, so don't expect that in a 2-hour, modern, big budget, international film. Some are giving bad reviews, but they might just be loyal fans who think that the movie betrays the Masterpiece of the late Douglas Adams. Snap out of it! The books were written over 25 years ago, and the TV series was filmed over 20 years ago. Remember, technology was basic. The only thing wireless in those days was my bra. During those ancient years I was considering buying my first VCR and torn between buying Beta or VHS. I was really wanting to buy a microwave, but they just came out and the prices were still too high to buy one for my own. A few of my friends were a still chatting on CB's and hanging out a Radio Shack. They were building the first personal computers, in their homes, from kits they bought through the mail. It's now 2005 people! Keep your mind open, and expect better robots, fantastic modern graphics, and a new interpretation of physical appearances with more globally-accepted accents. Resistance is useless, so accept that change is inevitable and allow yourself to be entertained. That's the ultimate award you can bestow upon the late writer. Be entertained. Adams DID have a hand in the screenplay. Think reasonably about what details to expect in less than 2 hours of film. It's remarkably consistent for a film that maneuvered so many Production hurdles. Your favourite line might not even be repeated in the movie. Mine was not. I'm not disappointed because LOTS of other funny lines WERE included. Listen carefully. You might not recognize those fast-paced lines right away because some of those deadpan British comments just don't come across the same in North American accents. The chained-linked references to 42 were barely minimal. Do you think Zaphod's apathetic and annoying characteristics may just appear as poorly-timed acting gestures of boredom to someone who hasn't already been introduced to the character. The graphics were excellent, and I'm going to need to see it at least a second time to fully appreciate the great FX instead of focusing on the characters. You will love Marvin and the Vogons. The Babelfish. What can I say? I want one! The film's introduction is a bit slow and devotes a long piece to the Dolpins. I loved it and found it relaxing before all the fast-paced dialogue that was to be delivered. The tune is still a bit stuck in my head. I'm interested in hearing other opinions.

The movie starts out with a brilliantly funny composition of a bunch of dolphins singing a song titled ""So long and Thanks for all the Fish"" I thought this was a good opener for it set a comical mood for the movie (in case you didn't know what you were getting yourself into) The first twenty or so minutes went without a hitch (no pun intended) I was a little turned off by Mos Def's performance, he could have done better. But Arthur dent was just as i had pictured him. As the movie went on i was quite impressed to see where the advantage of having a well-endowed Studio produce this movie; such as Disney. The CGI scenes such as the blowing up of the world and factory floor of the planet-manufacturing planet Magrathea, were particularly impressive. Besides characterization flaws and huge inaccuracies to the books (it seems they ran out of things from the book to put in the movie and in order to make it long enough to air they made up plot twists and inserted them into the movie) the movie is decent. I rated this movie five only because I felt it did fifty-percent of the work it should have. It had a job of making a good movie that was a credit to the awesome series it came from. It did not perform on the latter part of this task. The end credits display the words ""for Douglas"" well i am here to say that he is rolling over in his grave.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
994,Martin-726,Mindbogglingly Bad,1,13 May 2005,"Let me start by saying I loved the first radio series, liked the second series, loved most of the books and was fairly happy with the BBC TV version.I loathed this movie. I wasn't crazy about the casting (Simon Jones was a more enjoyably oafish Arthur Dent, Valentine Dyall was a better Deep Thought). The BBC2 Marvin was awful, but nowhere near as bad as the cute kids' TV robot in this terrible movie. But those are minor complaints.What's wrong with it is the script and the entire direction of the movie.Consider the opening. One of the running jokes is that Arthur wanders round space wearing pyjamas and a dressing gown. How did this come about? In all the other incarnations the logic is flawless: Arthur is outside his house in his dressing gown because a bulldozer is about to knock it down. He rushed out of his front door because he had no time to dress.His friend Ford Prefect turns up, knowing he has just a few minutes to get Arthur round to a pub and get some alcohol down him (to protect him from the shock of being transported into an alien space ship). He uses some slightly dodgy logic to persuade the demolition men to stop knocking Arthur's house down and drags Arthur (still in his dressing gown) off to the pub for some beer.It's crazy, but faultless. What Disney called ""illogical logic"".In this movie, when Arthur is lying in front of the bulldozer in his dressing gown, Ford turns up with a supermarket trolley loaded with beer. He has far more beer than would be necessary to get his friend drunk, therefore he must have known not only that a Vogon constructor fleet was on the way, but that Arthur's local authority had chosen that day to knock his house down. It makes no sense at all.Then, instead of giving his friend a couple of cans of lager, he gives the beer to the construction workers and drags Arthur off to the pub. He's supposed to be in a hurry, for heaven's sake. He has beer with him. They could drink the beer while lying in front of the bulldozers.There are instances where things that were funny in the original have been reproduced after the humour has been surgically removed by the director and/or screenwriters. When Ford and Arthur have been transported into the Vogon craft, they find themselves in an unsavoury part of the ship. In the radio, in the book, in the TV version, Arthur complains about this. The fact that his first reaction to interstellar transport is disappointment is funny. In the film you see how disgusting the spacecraft is, but both characters take it in their stride. This is not funny. The only people to be disappointed are the audience.In the radio/book/TV versions, Arthur is smitten by Trillian, but she does not reciprocate. This opens the door for some wonderful twists to the plot later on  Trillian having a child by Arthur without his knowledge; Arthur's love for Fenchurch. All of this is closed off by making Trillian respond to Arthur's advances in the film. Not only does it damage this film, it wrecks the chances of any sequels being made.I can't help suspecting they knew that this film, like the Modesty Blaise film made by Losey, would be so unpopular it would wreck the chances of any sequels being made.And yet  Astonishingly, when I had eaten all my popcorn and was about to leave the cinema, it turned into a good film. When Sartibartfast turns up, the director starts to do what he should have been doing from the start: using the latest technology to bring Douglas Adams' thoughts to life. the planet-building sequence is splendid.So my advice is, if you're not a fan, stay clear of this film. You'll hate it, and it will put you off reading the books. If you DO like Adams' work, wait till it comes out on video/DVD. Then you can fast-forward through the garbage and watch the last 15 minutes.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
995,rmerkishunt,No surprises here...,1,13 May 2005,"This movie is many things, but true to what Douglas Adams had written is not one of them. Too many original jokes were overlooked, all in favour of Hollywood-izing the whole thing. The movie plot consisted of sappy drool in its pursuit of romance whereas the original only ever implied any kind of romance. The movie lacked that nonsensical nature of reality all in favour of having things tied up nice and tightly. The character of Trillian is, perhaps, the worst of the worst. In the original she is a witty, forthright sort. In the movie, she is nothing like the original, relegated only to being a sappy, pouting sulking twit.This must be some new use of the words ""adapted from the original"" I hadn't previously encountered.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

998,theartinyourself,A cure for all depression - a rave review of my new favourite film!,10,14 May 2005,"I have just come back from seeing this film for the second time - the first time I have EVER done this for a film. Now I'm not one to commit myself to 'favourite things'.. but this is by far and easily my favourite movie yet! I have read the books, although not recently, and my boyfriend listens to the radio ones on CD, so I have a fair idea of the rest, but I have to say I love this film for pretty much everything.. so I shall tell you why! Cause my boyfriend's fed up of hearing about it so! Firstly, the song... oh my god the song!! I cannot get it out of my head, but I absolutely adore it! Especially the wonderful little dolphin in the middle. Secondly, the factory floor of Magrathea - as soon as they emerge into this space my face resembles Arthur's, but with far more of a smile! It just totally blows my mind, but in a way I can't quite figure out why! And then the final sequence, with all the wonders of the earth - also makes me smile, and for once, love this sorry old planet/country we live on! For, also, it must be noted that the sequence is not full of things that are from tropical islands, etc etc, but is full of English, basic wonderful things. (and this all comes from someone who's really rather cynical and bitter for her grand 20 years!) I think the whole film in fact has a lot to give towards the Brit friendly factor - it's chosen a fair few actors who are very telling of our time, and really fitting for it as well (Helen Mirren, Stephen Fry, Alan Rickman, Martin Freeman, Bill Nighy (although he was slightly miscast perhaps!)) and the whole collaboration seems to be full of people who are genuinely enjoying making the film and love it for everything it is. Also - Marvin. Just.. Marvin... I cried when he 'died' even though I knew he wasn't dying. That's another thing, although leaving me with this endless smile afterwards, there's this wonderful way they have of twisting your emotions - like with the Point of View Gun and Trisha.. that I realised on second viewing has a lot to do with the music. (So I've now got the soundtrack) - and I think in the factory floor and earth sequence scenes this is also a big effect. Look, all in all, I'm raving mad about this film, will probably go and see it again, and recommend it as an absolute cure for any manically depressed robots (or humanoids!!)

Arthur turns from an English version of Hank Hill, into a wimp. Ford was well acted. Zaphod's IQ dropped 30 points (extra arm & head almost non-existent). All the potential for Marvin to include facial expressions was lost with ping-pong ball head. Trillian had 1 good - no make that great (feminist) line.I kept losing the thread, when my attention wandered - good job I'd read the book plenty of times. Can't remember much else about the movie to comment on, it was too bland and the few funny bits were too far apart.This is one time, but not the only time, when BBC radio is better than Hollywood.I paid $6.50 to see this (about 3 pound 70p) - that's more than it's worth.

It was really sad, almost as if the people who wrote the script didn't 'get it'. I hate it when people think they need to digest a work to dumb it down to an American audience. Can Hollywood stand to create a film that isn't a formulaic love story? Or an even better question, why couldn't they wait until the fourth book, when there was an actual love story? Why did they have to cut a lot of the scenes from the book up and mix them around and add stuff that didn't belong there? Adams was a literary genius, a master of ironic prose and satire... why do people have to water down his works just because some idiots in the Midwest can't understand a film that doesn't follow a Hollywood plot line?

I've been following Hammer and Tongs (the directors) for some years now, and they haven't disappointed with this film. There is still the wit, the attention to detail and sheer inventiveness that you would see on their music videos that made their name. Marvin is a stroke of genius, the Vogons look excellent, and also the variety of different aliens that they bump into on their way (no CGI, all Jim Henson). The casting I thought was spot on, Stephen Fry was born to do the voice-over to this, Martin Freeman easily takes on the modern version of Arthur Dent (a 2005 bewildered male), Mos Def does an awkward impersonation of a human (not quite there, but a good attempt), Zaphod is far better than the TV version (that floppy second head always looked a bit pony), and Trillian is gorgeous (although more like I would imagine Fenchurch in 'So Long, Thanks....').But, of course there's a but. The love story looks like a bit of an afterthought (it's more soppy Hollywood, than anything approaching realism), the plot does dart all over the place, and it feels like it's been heavily edited down. With any luck they'll release a longer version on DVD. Can't quite see how they'll do a sequel (I doubt Douglas Adams dared write one), but it should be interesting nonetheless.Treat it as a bit of entertainment, and compared to a lot of sci-fi these days, it shows a lot more imagination.

It completely fit into the character, and was even believable, as well as being funny, hipper than hipper than hip, and just this guy, you know?

1010,Greybags,Mostly Tedious - buy the TV series instead,4,21 May 2005,"Well, I'm going to upset a few people by saying this - but the movie version of HHGTG is a stinker.If you enjoyed the book, or are a fan of the old TV series - I urge you NOT to see this film. Save your money and buy the TV series on DVD, it is vastly superior in almost every way.I went to see the film last night, and boy, do I wish I hadn't. The cost of two tickets would've paid for a DVD of the old TV series and I'd be a lot happier.It wasn't just the lack-lustre acting or the meandering plot - it was the fact that this film isn't funny that got me the most. In all fairness, the TV series has the luxury of having more time to develop characters and a plot (and jokes), but even a condensed version of that series would have been far funnier than what was dished up. I've heard that the late (and greatly missed) Douglas Adams wanted to change the film so it wasn't a direct copy of the earlier versions (radio, book, TV). Well, that's fine, but why did the plot need to include additions that didn't make sense?The character of Humma Kavatra was added - why? It didn't add much to the story-line. Trillian is almost fed to the Ravenous Bug-Blatter Beast of Trall. Why? It didn't add anything other than a long-winded satirical joke about Vogon bureaucracy. Zaphod's second head is now contained within his body, instead of literally being a second head perched on his shoulders. Why? I found it irritating and was exceptionally pleased when it was later hacked off. (Perhaps the SFX department wanted to show off). Arthur and Trillian now get together, instead of just being ship-mates. Why? HitchHiker's is a comedy, why does it need misty-eyed moments? None of these things add to the film, and for me they detracted from it.A clever and amusing addition was the Point of View gun (if you get shot by it you see things from the shooters point of view), but even that was botched as the gun only made a brief appearance at the end courtesy of Deep Thought. It came about as Humma Kavatra forced Zaphod to collect a ""gun"" from Deep Thought - which turns out the the POV gun. We never see why or how Humma wants the gun. If the plot is mucked around with to suit Hollywood, then surely things like this should be resolved up at the end.The best moment in the film is when the Vogons arrive at Earth Mark II to arrest the kidnapper of Zaphod, and get zapped with the Point of View gun by Marvin the Paranoid Android. Down the vast crowd of Vogons go like manically-depressed bowling pins.Unfortunately, amusing moments like this are few and far between. I amused myself during this film by spotting the well-known British comedians throughout it (such as the league of gentlemen, Bill Bailey etc) and spotting the in-jokes, such as the Marvin from the TV series appearing in the Vogon's queue, and the original Arthur Dent (Simon Jones) popping up as the automated warning system from the planet of Magrathea.Deep Thought's answer of 42 to Life, the Universe and Everything also falls a little flat. (Did Hollywood really want to change the answer or is that just an urban myth?)In the books and TV series, the main characters went around the galaxy having bizarre events thrust on them thanks to the improbability drive in the Heart of Gold (Zaphod's space-ship). The result was a lot gentle wit coupled with moments of biting satire, and many, many laughs.In the film, the main characters went around the galaxy having bizarre events thrust on them thanks to the improbability drive in the Heart of Gold, but thanks to the complex and convoluted plot, moments of wit and satire are few and far between. The result is a barrage of noises, characters, people, and exploding digitally-created shiny things, without actually being funny. It's a shame the film was so bad. The trailer was excellent - clever, witty and original, all the things I thought the film would be. My advice is to download and watch the trailer, and then forget all about the film.A friend who saw the movie suggested that maybe the film is a parable of life - ie. things happen to you almost randomly as you get powerlessly swept along by the larger and more powerful forces in the universe. If so, it's not a bad allegory, but surely life should be about having some laughs along the way.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

Then, they started talking about numbers and multiplication and how cool it would be to have a ""point of view"" gun. The youngest was most concerned with the fate of our planet and why anyone would want to destroy it, but the longest discussion centered around forty-two and what the question was.So, kudos to the filmmakers for creating a film that entertained me (34) and a group of kids and got these kids to think about life, the universe and everything.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
1012,rntdtnt,50% misfire.,5,28 December 2015,"About 50% of this movie is done well, but...Rockwell's Zaphod Beeblebrox was a total misfire. In the books and previous TV series he was at cool, ludicrous, offbeat, and weirdly, intentionally dense at times. He was highly convincing, as well: even knowing he was mostly a buffoon (and with him knowing that you knew it, too), you couldn't help but like him and think him effortlessly awesome. But in the 2005 movie, Rockwell played him like a Saturday morning cartoon of George W. Bush huffing model airplane glue, in a second-rate Ziggy Stardust costume. And the way the director chose to animate Zaphod's second head? That's just lame, c'mon. I mean, obviously it was to save effects money and production time (so they would only have to do it occasionally, rather than in every frame Zaphod's in), but it's confusing for neophytes, unconvincingly done as a special effect, and just plain dumb. Moving along: Trillian's basically played as a dull-but-cute cypher by Deschanel. She appears vacantly discomfited most of the time. Arthur and Ford: I'll admit, they're decent. Marvin: decent. Using Rickman's voice was genius for the depressed robot. The Vogons: also pretty perfect, really. The Guide's animations and voice-over: this was all dandy. But, despite some good elements in play here, the film simply isn't an enjoyable experience. It's a fair bit less than the sum of its parts. And many of the ""zanier"" parts of it are utterly baffling to those who've never read the books; the film does not present them in a way that's even slightly approachable. The screenplay, which Adams wrote/approved, is fine. It's not at fault here. It's the directing, the casting, the choices made by Rockwell and Deschanel, and the way it's paced (alternately zipping rapidly through some scenes that need more space, then crawling through others that really do not.)

No, I never played the original computer game, nor have I experienced Starship Titanic. But the important and relevant fact is that I have now seen this movie 4 times in theaters and the most annoying thing about it is that I can't buy the DVD yet! I expect it to be full of special features and loaded with goodies, much like the US and International web sites for this film. This movie definitely does credit to the memory and imagination of Douglas Adams. It is full of dry wit, features things that are both silly and profound such as whales and bowls of petunias and has that indescribable recreated-new-planet smell.

1018,coryness,Confusing fun,8,27 May 2005,"Do you know the most important item to take with you when embarking on intergalactic travel? Do you understand the significance of ingesting beer and salty nuts before attempting any form of intergalactic hitchhiking? Do you know the relevance of the President of the Galaxy's second head?If you answered no to any of these questions then Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy may seem like the strangest film of all time. That's not to say it isn't good and that you shouldn't go and see it - it was one of the most wonderful, confusing, obscure, absurd, wonderful films I have seen in a long time - it's just that without any knowledge of Douglas Adam's previous material, it just may just seem confusing, obscure and absurd.The story follows Englishman Arthur Dent (the Office's Martin Freeman) who wakes up one Thursday morning to find that his house is being knocked down and his best friend Ford Prefect (Mos Def) is not from America like he originally thought, but the planet Betelgeuse. To make matters even worse, Earth is being demolished by an alien race to make way for an intergalactic freeway. As luck would have it, Ford is on Earth researching for his tome the Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy and is able to use his well practiced hitchhiking skills to get them a ride on a passing Vogon spaceship. The Vogons', a creation from the Jim Henson Muppet shop, are an ugly, slimly race that use poetry on their stowaways as a form of punishment. As luck would have it Ford and Arthur are mysteriously teleported to the ship 'Heart of Gold' seconds before certain death only to find the co-captain of the ship, Trillion, was a girl Arthur fell in love with at a party back on Earth, Tricia McMillon (Zoey Deschanel). She was distracted by another man who offered to 'show her his spaceship' and Arthur never saw her again. The ships' captain Zaphod Beeblebrox (Sam Rockwell), the two headed, three armed President of the Galaxy, is Arthur's rival for Trillion's affection. The casting is spot on, so good in fact that the substitution of American actors for British characters barely garners notice. Sam Rockwell guarantees laughs every time Zaphod walks into the room and Mos Def proves that rappers can have great comedic timing. The special effects are also wonderful, the combination of puppetry and CGI working beautifully to create a seventies feel which compliments the ships décor and groovy clothing, a sure nod to the original TV series.If only the writers had kept to the original story and not added some unnecessary story lines (Arthur and Trillion's romance and the detour to visit Zaphod's arch enemy, played by John Malkovich) maybe more time could be spent explaining the in-jokes and less movie goers would leave the cinema feeling confused.I give Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy eight out of ten for the irreverence, the humor, the in-jokes, the cameos and all the times Zaphod Beeblebrox opened his mouth. I recommend all viewers to read Douglas Adam's Hitchhiker's series either before or after the movie to fully appreciate the comic genius that director Garth Jennings created. And the answers to the above questions? 1/ A towel, 2/ as a muscle relaxant and I'll leave the answer to question three, I'm sure it will be answered in the next movie 'The Restaurant at the End of the Universe' -make no mistake, there will be a next movie.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
1019,sean_mc22,"Unfortunately, a big disappointment",3,29 May 2005,"I loved the book of Hitchhikers Guide. Douglas Adams is one of my literary idols up there with Pratchett, Tolkien and Orwell. So imagine my disappointment when I saw this film. I'd gone into the cinema with such high hopes of a riotous traditionally British comedy. Instead I saw what I would describe as an Americanised dumbing-down. I know we're supposed to dislike Zaphod immensely, but was his acting supposed to be that bad? Almost the film's saving grace were choosing the legendary Steven Fry to voice ""The Book"" and Alan Rickman as ""Marvin the Paranoid Android"". Any idea of a plot the book contained went straight out of the window. The plot of the film did not seem to contain any cohesion or collaboration. Whether this was Douglas's idea to make things more interesting or it was just down to bad directing, we'll never know. There were some moments of hilarity, particularly the scene with the marvellous Bill Bailey-voiced ""whale"" but overall, I wouldn't recommend this film",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
1020,Abcdlmnog,Worst adaptation ever,1,29 May 2005,"Some books are perfect to be made into a film. Hitchhiker's Guide is not one of them. The adaptation of the novel was extremely poor, the only thing amusing were the quotes, for which we can thank only Douglas Adams. Everything else (the director's and actor's part) was pathetic, starting with the moment Dent hits his head in the ceiling. I mean, the guy has been living there for 7 years-don't you think he learned he has a low ceiling by now?! These kind of gags made we want to bite my hand off. But I'm not going to go into details about the story (read the book), but I'm going to tell my opinion on the characters. There were many actors that could play in this film, unfortunately, they weren't chosen. I'm positive that Martin Freeman (as brilliant as he was in The Office) failed to present Arthur Dent in the way Adams would have wanted. I'm pretty sure that Zaphod's heads ought to look like the ones Johnny Knoxville had in Men in Black 2, not to mention that Sam Rockwell in no way looked like the President of the Galaxy would. But that is not the saddest part. The worst mistake was, of course, Marvin, where you really made a horrible miscalculation in thinking people will find it interesting. Douglas Adams had a fantastic style of writing, and his words can only be interpreted, if one quotes them. If one wants to tell them in one's own way, it is impossible, and it only hurts the ones, that know his books by heart. Please, don't do that again.

1021,zaphyr,don't waste your time,3,17 September 2005,"I really liked the books, and was so looking forward to this movie. After watching it I feel....nothing. It feels like I have just seen a preview or something. A big balloon filled with air...pffft.. I think they should have made a trilogy instead, cuz the movie as it is now has nothing to do with the books. Where is the funny stuff? I laughed twice during the whole flick!! Where are all the other aliens? In this movie it seems that there are basically only two or three species, including humans. There is just so much missing to make the movie interesting!! That is why they should have made at least three movies, so we could get to know the characters better, and gotten more of the great stuff into the story. Sam Rockwell was by far the best actor, followed by John Malkovich and then Bill Nighy. Arthur was OK, but Trillian and Ford was just two empty shells...very strange to me that those two actually got the parts at all!If you liked the books, don't waste your time and money on this DVD....",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
1022,singwolf,Loved the book but not the movie,1,8 June 2005,"Panic ! My instinct told me not to watch the movie - being a big fan of the book - but never in my wildest dreams did I think that it could be this bad.One can put up with new characters and forgive whole new scenes in the movie. One can even swallow the bitter pill of artistic license, where necessary, but making this a love story between Arthur Dent and Trillian was asking for one bitter swallow too many. One can only hope for a speedy meeting at a dark alley between the director, Garth Jennings and the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal.The actors had little chemistry between them and Zaphod B, Ford P and Trillian were, terribly miscast. It would have been interesting to have Zaphod played as a combo Lord Flashheart / Cpt. Jack Sparrow (from Blackadder and Pirates of The Caribbean respectively), and making Trillian a little less of a bimboesqe caricature of the steely, intelligent Trisha MacMillian (of the book) who Arthur Dent tries to pick up, without success, at a party. But thats my opinion.I missed the interplay between Zaphod and Arthur (ok one-sided Monkeyboy put-downs) as well that between the crew and the ship-board computer. The movie was poorer for it. Mos D's Ford Prefect wasn't convincing and fell just as flat as Sam Rockwell's portrayal of Zaphod Beeblebrox.The British cast were a couple of notches better, even if Martin Freeman played Arthur Dent a bit more macho than expected. OK! artistic license. Perhaps its an intrinsic understanding of the humour - I don't know - but its wonderfully underpinned by the Bill Nighy's Slartibartfast sequence and Stephen Fry's rather wry narration throughout the movie.What was the purpose of adding Questular Rontok and Humma Kavula to the character list ? Did John Malkovich ask to act in the movie or something ? Why did Zaphod have one head on top of the other instead of side by side ? And whats this about a gun on Magrathea ? It deviated from the book without adding anything to it, making it ever so infuriating for those of us who HAVE read the book (repeatedly).I'd have liked to have seen the ""You'll Never Walk Alone"" segment that the ship-board computer sings just before the photon torpedoes hit the Heart-of-Gold, but then there are lots and lots of those types of scenes in the book, that never quite made the transition to film. Never mind, the special effects were great.Well I say, ""Don't Panic!"" Avoid this movie like you would a Vogon poetry recital. Spend the money instead on a copy of the Hitchhikers Guide of the Galaxy and for good measure, a towel. And every now and then, check the basements of your local city council or planning commission for any misplaced notices of house demolition that may actually be meant for you.Oh ! And yes !

1023,thatsallmine,It doesn't get much worse,10,3 August 2005,"After reading the 5 books and loving them, listening to the original radio series and loving it and seeing the old BBC TV-series and, well, liking that a bit (there's something about low-budget BBC scifi), along comes the movie. The thing that sets the movie apart from the other creations is that Douglas Adams is dead, and probably turning in his grave.Right off the bat it starts butchering the dry British wit of the book by destroying the scene where Arthur lies in front of the bulldozers, and then goes downhill from there. It seems that the filmmakers decided to cut a lot of things from the book to save time, yet ADD completely new stuff that has nothing to do with anything.As an example: I can't recall ever reading about Trillian being arrested by the vogons for kidnapping Zaphod, thereby forcing the rest of the crew to come save her. Nope. I wonder where the hell that came from. Yet another: And I surely don't recall ever hearing about Zaphod getting one of his heads cut off in order get the coordinates to Magrathea - where Deep Though apparently has moved to (for some odd reason). And deep thought makes weapons as well. Ah yes. Now I wonder which page all this is on.And it just goes on and on and on with this complete disregard for the books and the excellent humor within, an americanized easily digested movie with jokes and plots so thin you get paper cuts from them.To top it off they end the movie with the text ""For Douglas"". Yeah, I'm sure he likes that.This movie is nothing short of an atrocity, and Adams must be turning in his grave by this point.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
1024,alex_russellfalla,Great movie based on FANTASTIC book,9,17 June 2005,"I'm already a fan of Adams' The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. When I heard they were making a movie out of it, I admit, I was a bit skeptical. I feared that it would be a dumbed-down, americanized version of the witty, humorous novel. But my fears were for nothing. The movie was as good as a movie based on a book can get. I think it did a good representation of the amazing genius behind the books. Although it was a bit scant because of the length of time they needed to fit it in, the plot was gripping and unpredictable. It was all very funny, but it really made you open your eyes and think about the vast expansions of the amazing universe. This film was one of the most enjoyable films I have ever seen, and I will never get tired of seeing it. I'll watch it every chance I get.

1025,kevinwolf,Not a monument to Douglas Adams' creativity by any stretch...,2,19 June 2005,"I was very disappointed in the slapstick, knee-jerk spoof nature of this film. I found the original trilogy (yes, all five books!) to be intelligent and witty. The film somehow managed to play to the baser side of British comedy without managing to capture any of the eloquence that was Adams' hallmark. Perhaps in fairness I should say that much of what made the books funny was Adams' rather tongue-in-cheek manner of writing and his witty use of convoluted sentences (""...almost but not quite entirely unlike tea""). I realize that much of that witticism may not have translated well to the big screen, where everything is visual instead of literary. Still, I felt that the acting was below par and the props and costuming had all of the sophistication of a 1950s B-list monster movie. Alan Rickman's role as the voice of Marvin was one of the few saving graces. (Rickman is a genius at dry, dark, deadpanned lines - if you're not easily offended, try _Dogma_ for another taste of his acting.) John Malkovich's role was far beneath his dignity, and the rest of the cast were reduced to pandering sheer idiocy. It is too bad that Douglas could not have been present to influence the creative processes. All in all, the movie just doesn't live up to the genius of the books.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
1026,kathrynchan,"So very, very let down",2,17 September 2005,"Well, I finally relented and watched Hitchhiker's. What an utter disappointment. Not only as a fan of the books, but even as a stand alone movie it was absolutely cliché ridden and mediocre. When a movie that is obviously based in England has more American actors than Brits you know it's not a good sign. They should have just set it in the US. There were about 20 times where they left out some of the best gags that could have easily fit in the time and not required any backstory. The whole Zaphod thing was lame beyond belief. I like Sam Rockwell a lot, but he did a shitty job of Zaphod. Zaphod was supposed to be full of himself and not just a babbling moron. I was also correct in how I thought Mos Def would pull off Ford. He was great in Something the Lord Made, but he was totally flat in this movie. Martin Freeman did a decent job of Arthur, but the whole romance was so predictable. And Zooey Deschanel? Who the hell did she blow to get this part? She was awesome in Almost Famous, but completely mailed in this performance. Last, but not least I had the highest hope for Rickman as Marvin. In the past few years great actors, animators and directors have shown that you can get an evocative performance out of a pretty static piece of CG. In this case I thought it was a disembodied, disinterested voice that happen to coincide with the white robot appearing on screen. Peter Jackson showed how you can make a book come to life. The Harry Potter movies showed how you can veer from the books and still maintain the spirit. This movie showed how you can milk the humour and humanity out of a story for a quick buck. Seriously, 2 out of 10 and that's only because I laughed at the animations in the Guide twice.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
1027,kb-63,"Some good bits, some awful bits",3,27 June 2005,"I'm a big fan of the Hitchhiker books, radio and TV series, and I wanted very much to like this movie. In the end, I don't regret seeing it -- I didn't walk out in the middle or anything -- but I found it weird and disconcerting, for reasons that even now I don't fully understand.First the good parts. Some of the characters are well cast. Martin Freeman is a very convincing Arthur Dent, for example. Mos Def made a surprisingly good Ford Prefect, although I wouldn't have believed it if I hadn't seen it. Some of the supporting characters were good -- Bill Nighy as Slartibartfast, Bill Bailey as Whale in particular. Stephen Fry was just perfect as the voice of the Book, and the Vogons were brilliantly animated and voiced. Some of the special effects sequences were just staggering. It made me glad that we still have real cinemas, and sorry for the poor saps who will watch this movie as a fuzzy divx file recorded from the back of the theatre by some prat with a camcorder.Now the bad parts. Most obviously, the filmmakers tried too hard to cram a three-hour radio series into a 90 minute movie _and_ add an extra segment of plot. As a result, much of the original dialogue was truncated. Here is just one example (of many). In the radio and TV series, the opening exchange between Dent and Prosser contains a long diatribe about the difficulty of finding Local Authority plans (they were in an unlit basement, in a disused lavatory, in a locked filing cabinet marked 'beware of the leopard', etc, etc). You may, or may not, find this dialogue amusing; but in the movie it ends with 'I had to go down to the basement'. The exchange therefore contributes nothing to the plot, and the contrast between the Councils' demolition of Dent's house, and the Vogons' demolition of Earth, loses all impact. There are also places where the filmmakers have shaved a few seconds off the dialogue in the worst possible places, causing it to sound completely out of place.The deletion of large chunks of the plot line leads to confusion. For example: it is never made clear why Dent and Prefect are chucked out of the Vogon ship, just after they have been picked up. If the Vogons didn't want them, why did they pick them up in the first place? Then there is problem of the characters themselves. Although they were well played, the characters in the movie were not the same as the originals -- even if they had been played by the same actors they would have been different characters. Arthur Dent starts off the same, then turns into a sort of action-hero towards the end. I think even a person unfamiliar with the radio series and books will find this a strange transition. After all, no reason is given for it. The screenplay certainly displays touches of Douglas Adams' genius. The 'point of view gun', for example, is distinctly Adamsy. However, I simply can't believe that Adams wrote the appalling corny, Disney-esquire ending. Nor can I believe that he was responsible for Marvin being 'killed', and then coming back to life for no obvious reason. He was just too much a perfectionist to put up with such bizarre incongruities in the plot. It does not bother me that this movie is not particularly true to the original book, etc. On the contrary, I would have been disappointed if it had ended up as a remake of the television series with modern special effects. No -- what bothers me is that, in trying to reconcile the original dialogue, plot, and characters with the requirements of the movie industry, it has ended up with a confusing plot and one-dimensional characters. I'm not sure whether this movie would have worked better for me if I had been less familiar with the books and radio series. In the end, the test of a movie that is derived from a different format surely has to be whether it works _as a movie_. I got very irritated by all the Tolkien fans who complained that the recent LOTR movies were not true to the original books. Why the hell should they be? But those movies did work as movies, and this one, sadly, does not. Which is a shame, because I very much wanted to like it.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
1028,plabord,"Mixed feelings--the BBC show was better overall, more clever",3,28 June 2005,"I'm not exactly a long-term fan of ""Hitchhiker's,"" having only seen the video of the original BBC episodes ""made into a movie"" about two months ago. But I went to see this movie because I wanted to see how it would compare to the original, and I definitely came out disappointed by some of the changes.Although there was a mostly successful attempt to retain the original zaniness and ""Monty Pythonesque"" humor during most of the movie, I don't understand why on earth somebody felt that a romantic involvement between Arthur and Trillian had to be stuck into the plot. It was SO unnecessary and SO totally out of place!! And to have the conclusion revolve around it!! I cringed in disbelief towards the end, during the scene at the dinner table where the only thing Arthur cares about is whether Trillian is the right girl for him. Gimme a break! And again later, when they hug and decide to go off and pick up where they left off. Quite frankly I didn't care at all. What I wanted to see was whether the ending would be as clever as it was in the BBC production, where the question about the ""Answer to Everything,"" and what the corresponding question might be was pretty cleverly tackled. But that was sorely missing here.Was it Douglas Adams' idea to introduce the romantic element into this movie, or worse yet, to have it be the driving force behind the conclusion? I somehow doubt it. Although I may be wrong, the man strikes me, at least from what I saw in the BBC episodes, as having been too much of an iconoclast to have put this kind of sappy sentimentalism into his otherwise extremely clever and lighthearted creation. Although of course the special effects are better in the movie, and Zaphod's idiotic dummy head is thankfully gone, the BBC production was much more lighthearted, clever, and even intellectual--especially toward the end.

Still, it's pretty good, pretty ridiculous of course, but I just didn't imagine Marvin like that. My friend has not read the book, nor has he heard of Douglas Adams, and he was just watching the screen confused as humanly possible. He just didn't get it. It seemed incredibly stupid to him.

1030,hailthecgisnake,A waste of time.,4,3 October 2015,"I bought this film on CD-DVD in a second hand bookshop for about 5 dollars, as I remember. I was under the impression that at the very least it would be ""so bad it's good"", but my overwhelming impression was of a mediocre sci-fi flick that didn't know what it wanted to be. This film is the epitome of non-committal: rather than be a broad sci-fi comedy or commit to the often absurd, sometimes surreal, niche and esoteric humour of the radio series, television series, book trilogy and interactive text adventure, it oscillates between trying to please an established fanbase with characters and plot elements from previous versions, introduced with little explanation, and trying to appeal to a wider audience and possibly the studio management with a pasted-on romance (which, in fairness, was in Douglas' original script, but I'd bet my life it wasn't as clichéd as this), a more streamlined, traditional story arc and some new plot elements, some of which, admittedly, could have been very interesting. I'm going to concentrate on the casting and characterisation, because I only have so much room. While Martin Freeman is a fine actor and is pretty decent in the role, it's a tiny and niggling annoyance that they didn't cast someone around six feet. While it doesn't sound like much, the character of Arthur Dent was specifically based on Simon Jones, the actor who played him in the radio and TV series'. He's specifically described as ""tall and nervous"", and it's almost a manifestation of his character: he's forever trying not to trip over anything, and is just a little too big for the world around him, constantly at ill ease.It's a recurring problem throughout: small details that, once gone, take away a lot of the series' intelligence and charm: Ford being from Guildford U.K is funny because it's so unexotic, and because Lewis Carroll lived there. Zoe Deschanel, who takes the role of Trillian, is also a decent comedy actress, but plays and is written as a generic ""manic pixie dream girl"" who's here to shake the hero out of his stupor, which is at odds with her characterisation in previous iterations of H2G2: she's an astrophysicist who ran away because she now knew everything she knew was only the surface, and to get away from being overqualified and on the dole. Her and Zaphod have a more complex relationship, at least in the book: it's hinted at that he really does have some substance under all the bluster. Here, she's just here to bring our ""hero"" into a world that's fantastic, whereas in previous iterations, apart from her general disinterest in him, his steadfast refusal to enjoy his time in space, instead always searching for something familiar. She was always looking at the stars. Zaphod's second head is no longer visible, which is annoying, since it's one of the character's most famous aspects, and amusing, since a few lines about it in the radio show caused a nightmare for the TV makeup department. Ford seems to judder between suaveness and alien awkwardness. Overall, I'd say this film needed to look a bit closer at the source material, take a few deep breaths and go right into the absurdity, because that's where H2G2 lives or dies—and maybe reinsert more of the classic lines, in proper context, for good measure. Whole, very famous segments are missing that have otherwise always been present—I don't object to changes, since there are many between different iterations, but some things always remain. This film feels like a normal comedy with some sci-fi bits tacked on. In short: Douglas Adams wrote many of the episodes very close to the deadlines, had to borrow bits from a comedy sci-fi novel John Lloyd was writing (with his permission) and had no overarching plot line in mind, and the radio series was still very funny, very well-received and had genuinely poignant moments and an engaging story. The TV series had some crummy special effects (albeit the best the BBC could do even with axing other shows), a malfunctioning moving head and some actors replaced, and the same still applies: the guide animations (done by hand) still look good, the FX are almost endearing and fit with the tone of the story and David Dixon did a great job as Ford. The Interactive Text Adventure didn't feature any moving images, but it's still canon, introduces some elements that otherwise wouldn't have made it in and again is very much in line with the rest of the series. Go watch the TV series, read the book, play the game or even buy the towel, and you'll have much more fun and be more entertained. Hell, listening to a Pink Floyd album would give you a better idea of the series than this film. So, that's about that, with the exception of my thousands of other complaints. On the bright side, the redone theme is nice and as far as I know no one actually died during the making of the film.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

1035,remembercolumbia,laughed a whole total of twice,3,18 September 2005,"usually, when i read or hear someone say that they read the book before they saw the movie (any book/movie in general, not talking about H2G2 specifically here), and then they say how much better the book was and that they didn't like the movie version, i almost always tell myself that was because they were biased ahead of time, and that no movie could ever meet their expectations, and that they are not giving the movie a fair chance. well, this time it (ironically) is ME saying that i read the book first, and that the movie sucked. the movie version mauled and deviated so much from the story that i had read. maybe it is because the clever writing must be very hard to turn into a film. it seems like everything was done halfway, from the script to the acting to the directing. marvin the robot was about the only thing done well. btw, i DO like British humor (like monty python), but i laughed a whole total of twice during H2G2.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
1036,kerkekruis,Even in Hollywoodstyle Douglas Adams is funny,10,8 August 2005,"The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy I have been looking forward to this movie for a long time. I had my hopes and my fears. I was very happy to hear that the movie was going to be made with the Henson company (instead of with a lot of computers), also the role of Stephen Fry as the book made me very happy. But it still was a big Hollywood movie with a new script. Although the script was also made by Douglas Adams I was scared the typical English humor would get lost.Hammer and Tongs (the director team) clearly got experienced in Video Clips, their style also fits the Henson-style quite well. Every single shot of the movie is cool in a lot of ways. The visuals in the movie are really stunning and are by itself a good reason to go and see the film. It is very cool to see the planet-making in action, almost as cool as the destroying of earth )I'm sure everybody already knows this would happen). The Vogons are more ugly anyone could image, Marvin is both cute and depressing and Martin Freeman as Arthur Dent is a example of very good casting. The fans of the books cannot by disappointed by how the film looks.But now more important; the story. The plot of the book is a masterpiece, but, as said before, Douglas Adams adapted the plot for the movie. Mostly I was very happy with this new plot. It looks not like and 'altered', but like and 'improved' plot. I very much got the idea Adams has been going through his story for a lot of years and wanted to improve the storyline. The book is more a collection of very funny facts and lines, this movie plot it more like 1 whole. For instance, in the movie Marvin get a real function (although he'll probably won't like it). Also the Vogons got more dept (which makes then of course even more horrible). It was also very funny to see how Ford and Arthur became friends.The thing that makes this movie something special is that you can see it has been made with love. You can also see that at all the details. Just look a the trivia on the IMDb-site. And of course, don't walk away from the cinema until the very very last end Even the original soundtrack of the BBC-radio version has been used. With this movie Douglas Adams is honored in a very good way.Are there negative things to say? Yes, although it's mostly a result from the previous. The new plot includes (except for a lot of changing's) two whole new parts. There was only one thing to do to make it not to long; to speed it up. The story goes quite quick, a lot of explanations and silly dialogs have been cut. It all makes it a bigger Hollywood spectacle, but I'm quite sure it's all hard to follow if you don't know the book.A last thing that worries me is that give a very big clue where the story is going at the end, to part two. Part two of the book is also a big masterpiece, but this time there is no Douglas Adams anymore for the screenplay. And I don't trust anyone else with this script.This movie is one big spectacle, but if you want to get it completely you also need to do your homework. So, read the book and the movie-trivia first! I enjoyed myself very much and can't wait until I can add this movie into my DVD-collection.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
1037,beamhive,liked the BBC mini-series better!,6,11 August 2005,"The movie was mildly entertaining. Having seen the original BBC series, the movie lacks something. I guess maybe I like British humor, and maybe the movie is too American? Perhaps more explanations by ""The Guide"" could be useful? Transitions were not smooth at all--very choppy. My husband was totally lost, although he really didn't know what to expect, not having seen the original or read the books. Where was the, ""Please enjoy your trip through this door.""? A sigh just is not pleasant at all, is it? Marvin was not nearly depressed enough to be manically-depressed. I just really preferred the original, although the cameo by Simon Jones was a nice touch.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
1038,klawendl,Really Disappointing,1,11 August 2005,"I read the books several times first in German, then in English! I love them and every time I read them i find something new! I can't believe that Douglas Adams himself has worked on the script to this movie! Of course it's very difficult to put all the book with it's density in a 2hrs movie, but if you can't do it - don't try it! They really dropped every genius idea so that the movie appears to be a slapstick movie! They spent lots of money for quite good special effects, but the philosophy is left out. What about the woman who found the way to global peace without nailing someone to a cross? It's on the first page and appears again later in the story! It's one of the many brackets in the story that makes it so complex and interesting! If someone hasn't read the book(s) he might think that all the cult about it is absurd! For me this movie has the quality of 'Highlander II' or 'Planet B: The Antman'(German movie)! I wish I hadn't seen them!",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
1039,ublis,Tries and fails,4,24 July 2006,"It's quite obvious that some effort has gone in this movie: it's visually impressive, with overall good sets and a very convincing depressed robot Marvin. It has its moments (I like the dolphins at the beginning, the fragments from the Guide, the whale who wanted to become friends with the big round thing, the flyswatters scene, the POV gun), but it mostly fails to entertain. Perhaps it gets better on a second viewing, but I can't bring myself to watching it again.Sometimes the script is to blame: the movie starts in an absurd situation with Arthur Dent finding out that his home is going to be demolished. This has a lot of potential to become very funny and indeed it is in the book. It has however been modified for the movie and it no longer is. People have complained about the removal of the room with the ""Beware of the leopard"" sign and rightfully so. The Arthur-Trillian romance is there just because of the law that a standard movie should have a romance, regardless of how misplaced it is - I don't watch an absurd comedy to learn valuable moral lessons, thank you very much. The funny POV gun was spoiled by overusing it to go all sentimental. Whether the flaws in the script are to be blamed on Adams or somebody with no (or a different) sense of humor butchering his work, I have no idea - and frankly I don't find it important in judging the movie.I also think the actors aren't cast properly and don't deliver their lines with good comedy timing. I hear them saying things I know are funny, but they don't even make me smile. Either the actors are unable to do comedy, or the director had no idea how to make them shine.All in all, a disappointment. Out of 10 points, the comedy part should have accounted for 8 and the SFX for 2. Full marks on the latter, a mere 2 stars for the comedy.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
1040,nja1234,A Book Fan's Dislike,3,30 December 2005,"If you were a fan of the ""trilogy,"" then you may be surprised to hear that the movie strays almost completely from the storyline. Several things/people from the books are included, such as Slartibartfast, but they are changed and twisted into this very short movie. Any die-hard fan will be disappointed to find that they only say ""42"" about 3 times in the movie. The ""Hitchiker's Guide"" is only used to tell the movie watchers what creatures like Vogons are. At the beginning, dolphins are featured singing a song about ""Goodbye and thanks for all the fish"". Zaphod is more stuck-up than in the books, and he gets one of his heads cut off for a ""point-of-view"" gun, which is then used to reveal that Trillian loves Arthur. Most of the movie is ""exciting"" action sequences of the protagonists getting shot at by Vogons or romance scenes between Arthur and Trillian. Marvin the robot is hardly featured, except for when he gets a hole blown in his head. He then proceeds to get up and shoot the ""point-of-view"" gun at the Vogons. There is also a revealing scene where it is shown that the mice were really just two children-like beings who wanted to know ""the question"". Overall, I give this movie a 3 out of 10, for totally mashing up a good story.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
1041,emiliano-heyns,Don't go see the movie if you've read the books,1,28 August 2005,"All the good jokes are either cut short or missing.The plot is all over the place because they wanted to put in all the good bits with too little time to properly tie the story together.Zaphod is just a joke, and not in the good sense. The second head _under_ the first head?! Puh-lease!Soppy love interest between Arthur and Trillian.The heart of gold looks _nothing_ like the books describe.Zaphods quest is now the Ultimate Question instead of finding the ruler of the universe.Zooey Deschanel acts like it's her first ever appearance in a school play. Sam Rockwell role on board of the HOG consists mainly of doing somersaults over the furniture.A total letdown. Even my 6-year-old who _doesn't understand a word of English_ easily pick out out _numerous_ errors against the book.

The original TV version is a superb sci-fi/comedy.This film is anything but funny.The plot is very rushed and disjointed ,compressing the whole story into(mercifully only)110 minutes.The acting is totally flat-some scenes remind me of rehearsals!I am glad i did not pay to see this at the cinema.It is a shame that a negative score cannot be given.This is the worst film i have ever seen-my wife is watching it with me and agrees(her comments cannot be printed for obscenity reasons.)For the sake of movie watchers throughout the galaxy, please BAN this movie.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

I watched it with some people who had never had anything to do with the original and they had no idea what was going on. This remake of a really excellent original series really doesn't work.

Having read the book and experienced all the stuff that followed, it was only a question of time. The cinema experience of the Hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy was amazing, now seeing it on DVD enjoying all the extras and bonus material is just fantastic. It's an extremely fast moving film, jumping from one improbability ( ;-) ) to another in a matter of minutes, it is hilariously funny, and for me having read the book just delightful to see Douglas Adams ideas come to live. But even for someone who hasn't read the book ( such as my boyfriend, whom i forced to see this film ), it is easy to understand, it's made in a very naiv way, which superbly reflects DA's personal approach towards the entire subject. A wicked and witty film. Must see.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
1045,mark-2066,let's hope a sequel saves it,3,12 September 2005,"I wanted to write a big review for this movie, but I'm not allowed to write more than 1000 words or 10 lines or something, and this movie needs more to express how I'm feeling for it. Seems I wrote too much and IMDb doesn't want to know.So, to sum up, quickly and briefly, I'm glad Douglas Adams never saw this (although it shouldn't have been because he died before it was made). I'm not even sure it deserves a 3/10. It just hurts me to score it any lower. Everything is lower than average as far as this movie goes: scripting, casting, screenplay, everything.Here's the spoiler... and any HHGTTG fan will, I'm certain agree... It's totally wrong to have Arthur and Trillian kissing in the last scene!!!! I cannot believe Douglas Adams wrote that.... Arthur is surely supposed to be the person who ""if you were the last human being alive"" was a common expression, even when he was. Even though in later books Trillian has Arthur's child, he never actually shagged her... ever.Having Arthur kissing Trillian is like having Frodo shagging Galadriel in Lord of the Rings, and if anyone would've done that it would've been Peter Jackson, and even he didn't stoop so low.Hollywood has once again ruined a great story, and the one story I wish it hadn't. I care not for the director telling everyone how he worked with Adams for so long... either Adams was deluded, or he made a rubbish film.

1046,oaj,Stay home.,1,13 September 2005,"Not good. The best part was when I early in the movie decided to leave the theater and pay a visit to my mother in law. The bad acting and low technical quality in sound and image, made it look like a loosing project from a film school. Clearly the makers never understood the point of the book and why it got so popular. How is it that anybody can promote a movie like this all the way to the theaters ? Well that is actually a question fit for most movies coming out of Hollywood, but I guess the answer is money and that even bad movies has some kind of profit after all. So another big question is: What is the average IQ of the audience watching all the bad movies ? 42 is my guess - thats how I felt until I left.

Very little adheres to the book.It doesn't even come close to the original series.(I have several sets of both the book and the series) Things were added to the movie that were never included in the book or series or for that matter the original radio broadcast. About the only thing I did like in this was the special effects regarding the dolphins. I did like Marvin the Paranoid Android. I believe that The Restaurant at the End of the Universe could have used a bit more oomph. I was severely disappointed. This is one movie I would not even recommend to my worst enemy.,The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
1049,kevincross_1,I really didn't like it,5,14 May 2006,"It just wasn't funny, didn't have any warmth and didn't have any of the attributes that made the radio show/books and even the TV series so charming.Zaphod is very irritating and has no charm. I really didn't care for the performance given in this release. The accent is wrong and we get no sense of the duplicity of the character.Most of the dialogue (those beautifully timed words of Douglas Adams) is garbled and badly delivered.Marvin looks rubbish and didn't have enough time on screen.Where was the battle tank sequence Douglas promised us? Trillian was too quirky and stupid. She's supposed to be an astrophysicist and highly intelligent. She just comes across as sappy and pouty. I didn't fancy her, either.Ford was OK, but is supposed to be cooler than Zaphod and far more reluctant to get involved in things. Especially danger and rescues. He would far rather go to a party.The Heart Of Gold looked poorly designed. It is supposed to be an artistic statement of scientific brilliance.The Vogons shouldn't be so heavily involved. Their look was OK, I guess.Deep Thought was poorly realised.Martin Freeman was actually quite good, but the character of Arthur is not supposed to be heroic. He's meant to be far more a fish-out-of-water.Slartibartfast was well played by Bill Nighy.Stephen Fry was well cast. I accept that many of the book's lines would have to be cut for running time.I didn't think the readouts from the book were all that. I would have thought in this time of DVDs, Zoom function etc, half the point of making the film would be to cram the screen with an overload of Guide information that would please the die hard fans and make the whole release a higher quality product. I believe the book readouts from the Making Of Hitchhiker's (Documentary about the TV series,If anybody's seen that) were much nearer the mark. To be fair the style of the readouts in the film was different and reasonably interesting and funny at times.My girlfriend just said that even if you were watching it as someone who didn't know the originals that well, it wasn't that great or interesting. And she doesn't know it that well, plus is a total babe.Why couldn't Zaphod have had two heads (ie, separate craniums)? Again, in this digital age it would have been very cool to see how it would look if done correctly. Quite frankly this came as a huge disappointment to me for one very simple reason. Name one other character in a film or TV show who has two heads. It would have been iconic and unique to see it. It could be very easily achieved and could have been very funny. It also would have made a very cool action figure.Anyway, I'm ranting. I will just say that I am (obviously) a die hard fan. In my defence though, that means that I have seen, read, heard every version of the Trilogy in 5 parts and am more than happy to go with the inconsistencies in all the previous tellings of the story. I have no problem with it having different twists of plot or being reduced to 90 minutes or so. What I was particularly not happy about is that the only thing that made me laugh out loud was the line delivered by the Magrathean computer answering service: ""In order to improve our service delivery, your death may be recorded and used for training purposes"".Unfortunately, this release is now the definitive movie version of HHGG that we've/I've been waiting for for 20 years. No one is planning to make a remake (At least for another 10 years in the current movie making climate) and we're stuck with, what to my mind, is a half hearted and indifferent movie.Finally, some positives: 1) Certain sequences looked very good. I liked the whale and the factory floor at Magrathea particularly. I'm not a huge fan of digital effects, but they were well used here.2) Simon Jones was in it, as was Douglas' face at the end.3) Arthur's house is much better than the one used in the TV series, ie not especially nice or charming.4) It ended and I still have the radio tapes and my imagination.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

It was a nice touch that the original Marvin was in one of the scenes and I that the original Arthur Dent played the head that issued the warning about landing on Magrathea. The original series is available on DVD for those that want to see how it could have been improved.

1053,langecarrie,A great movie - and I have read the books (all of them),10,16 February 2006,"It's too bad so many ""fans"" of the book have given such bad reviews of this movie. This is one of the funniest movies ever. If they went word for word from the book, the movie would have been about 12 hours long and gotten very boring, mostly because it would require a lot of reading from the book (and the 12 hour thing...) That's the difference between books and movies. If you want word for word from the book, then go read the book again! I have read The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy; The Restaurant at the End of the Universe; Life, the Universe, and Everything; So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish; and Mostly Harmless in case any one wonders if I am a huge fan.I was only disappointed that they didn't explain the towel a little bit more, but that wouldn't matter to the average person watching it. It was hilarious and anyone would be able to grasp the ultimate deeper meanings behind it. It is funny and moving at the same time. It has a point to make and it makes well, all the while making you laugh.And don't forget - Douglas Adams himself made many of the revisions and was a vital part of this movie, God rest his soul.I tried to explain the books to my husband years ago, but not till he saw the movie does he want to read them. I will wager many others will read the books for the first time after watching this movie.Also both my 3 year old son and 7 year old daughter love it, it's a great family movie that ALL ages will enjoy and you sure don't find that very often. There is no sex, no graphic violence, no swearing. Kind of like Galaxy Quest (who, by the way Sam Rockwell and Alan Rickman also starred in...) I wish there was a filter for ""no reviews from ridiculously obsessed fans"" on here.

My first disappointment was in the characters. While the Book voice paid tribute to the feeling of the book the the visual characters did not. The character of Arthur Dent was not bad but those of Ford Prefect, Zafod and Trillion were very poor. My hat goes of to Slartibartfast you was first class. The story line was also disappointing which after the initial plot just seemed to disappear into oblivion with the planet Earth demise. Why the book version of the story line was changed so much is beyond me. However in addition to Slatibartfasts performance there is other praise and that was for the cameo appearance of certain characters and individuals throughout the movie.

Well, I changed my mind and wanted to judge the movie for myself. And I don't regret it, the movie still contains Douglas Adam's words spoken by Stephen Fry. Yet, it is not a simple ""modern look"" for the old series. There are differences to the book, for example in chronological order, but the book already differed from the ""real"" original, the BBC radio series. Adams obviously never told the same story but liked to vary it. The new movie even contains new characters, yet even those have been conceived by Douglas Adams himself (see the Salmon of Doubt).

1058,jelco_galactaboy,Hidden jokes of Adams' humour!,8,9 August 2006,"I had bought the 1996 omnibus edition after someone had told me about it, and it struck me right from the beginning. I had only just finished it when I returned from my holiday and watched the DVD as soon as I got the chance. I must say, it was quite different from what I had expected, but still, it's a great movie.It all started with the radio series back in 1978, and all things after that (first two books, TV-series, stage versions, comics, adventure games) were all based on those radio series. The movie however, was based on the books. That already makes it quite different from the original. But what is so well done, is the fact that it includes new material - as for all new media - as the second act that makes it work so well, it makes up for the other shortcomings.The love-story in the movie is different from the one in the books and radio series. That does change my attitude a little. But it has been evolving throughout the movie - it doesn't just pop up.The two new planets were not just made up (although they never go to those planets in the books). The name of Vogsphere appears quite a few times, and Viltvodle VI is included in the same guide entry as was used in the movie - but that one appears in the second book, not the first.What many people don't know, is that the scripts has been written and edited by Douglas Adams since the 1980's. But just like with the books, Adams just doesn't seem to pay any attention to deadlines. He passed ten on his first book only. I quote: ""I love deadlines. I like the whooshing sound they make as they fly by."" But all the extra material was invented by him, even in the very early stages of filming. And although Adams died in 2001, the script hasn't been changed dramatically since, showing that he had quite finished it, and they liked his work. That's an important reason for his name popping up so early in the credits.There are a lot of hidden things in it which you'll discover if you listen to the audio commentaries on the DVD. And keep watching the credits, because a last guide entry appears at that moment. The commentaries said something about Men in Black having the same thing in it, but although I haven't seen that one, I can assure you Adams had invented it first, since it was taken from the first book, written in 1979.All these things make it a great movie, and I'm going for the radio series now, too. If you know about the original stories, don't be bothered by the changes; Adams loved changing his material for different media. And forgetting about the changes, it's a great movie on it's own.Jelco",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
1059,mail-2136,Truly disgraceful,1,1 November 2005,"Having read all the books and watched the TV series several times over I hope the people that made this appalling film are ashamed of themselves.Firstly, after about 30 minutes the films strays from the books/TV series and follows it's own path. Worse still, lots of very funny one liners have been ditched. The books and TV series are funny, this has not one funny line in it.I've given lots of thought to just why it's so bad and the main reason is that the character of Ford Prefect is all but written out of the film. There's nothing, no interaction with Arthur, nothing ! He might as well not be there at all.Also, the ""book"" hardly gets a look in either. How can that be ? Maybe it's that the film is just too short ( just over 100 minutes compared to 180 minutes of the TV series ) that the story simply does not fit in to the time available.In short, it's a total disgrace.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
1060,kagress,This is the Guide?,3,12 November 2005,"When this movie was first advertised, I said to myself, ""This will either be great or terrible."" Sadly, it's the latter.With the vast materials of Adam's work available, for some reason we deviate fairly terribly from the original plot, cut many of the best parts of the book, use the voice of the Guide sparingly to relatively limited effect, relegate Marvin to just about a bit part, and generally suck the fun out of the story.Granted, translating the book, the hysterical radio series, and the less funny but still quite good television series into a format that would work on the big screen was going to be a challenge. But one can't help but wonder about the decisions that were made. Why were Marvin's best speeches were cut to almost nothing? Why was his use so limited (for him to be funny, he needs to be far more pervasive and the cast needs to actually get *frustrated* with him as they did in the book)? Why is the romance between Arthur and Trillian so overplayed? Why do we deviate so horridly from the original plot? What in the name of Zarquon is the sub-plot with Zaphod and his opponent in the presidential election all about? Sadly, the movie fails to deliver on its potential. While there seemed to be a passing effort to keep true to the relatively light-hearted, almost completely random, thoroughly silly, and amazingly satisfying humor and escapades of the Guide, it simply wasn't enough. What there was for a plot was relatively thin, where it deviated from the book added nothing to the story, and where the original plot was followed too much was cut. One would suspect that the Vogons had something to do with the editing.Rather than spending your time on this particular translation, I'd spend your money on a copy of the original radio play (if you can find it), the BBC television series, or simply re-reading the original works. While there's the occasional chuckle here, it's not worth the money to wait for, and disappointing enough to make you wonder what exactly you spent your money on.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
1061,neptune_bob,Nothing like the original,3,27 June 2006,"I completely and categorically disagree with the review that says that this movie accurately reflects the content of the original. It absolutely doesn't.The original radio show, followed by the original BBC TV mini-series, followed by the original book, were all many times funnier than this high-budget, low-laughs disaster. The makers apparently took advantage of Douglas Adams' untimely death to bastardize the script, and try to turn it into another Star Wars, rather than keep it silly, cantankerous and hilarious, as it was originally written. It's reasonably well done, in that it has great sound, nice visual effects... and barely a chuckle in the whole thing.Save your money, and see the BBC TV mini-series instead. You might read the book too, if you dare. In either case, you'll get dozens of times more laughs than you will from this sad attempt to make the Hitchhiker's Guide into a ""serious"" science fiction blockbuster. It's certainly not what Adams would have wanted, and it was a bitter disappointment to me too, after many years of waiting to see it.The makers of this movie just didn't ""get it"".",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
1062,Dyllholio,"Unfaithful, but funny!",9,2 March 2006,"The book has been torn. The Original Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy novel, which I have read, was a quirky sort of funny. It had very oddly funny parts in it. This film has taken many of those funny bits out, many of which left me laughing for days. For this reason and more, the movie version has failed to be faithful.Removing many important parts from the novel is one thing, but then adding new plot sequences is another. This movie was very similar to what The Series of Unfortunate Events movie turned out to be.I will shift from complaining and get to more.Mos Def is and insanely funny actor. He is delightfully odd as Ford Prefect. Sam Rockwell as Zaphod Beeblebrox was an awful decision. He was just idiotic as Zaphod, and he was one of my favourite characters. I also hated the whole ""head under head"" idea. Zooey Deschanel as Trillian was another terrible idea. She's a talented actor and all, but this was not the script for her. Martin Freeman is now pretty cool in my books. One of the few actually English in the main roles, it seems as if he knew the book. And finally, the way Marvin was interpreted made me mad. He looks like a web cam!! Overall, this film was good, but not Excillent. I hope they do better with The Restaurant at the End of the Universe, if they decide to do it.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

So many people who love this series want more. I don't. This movie was great. And it is also interesting to anyone who hasn't read the books. These books simply can't be fully interpreted.

1064,joscobo,Couldn't they find any comedians,5,28 December 2008,"First things first, I've been a huge fan of the trilogy since I first saw BBC reruns of The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy on the local PBS station. Later reading the books made me laugh out loud and still do. The movie didn't make me or anyone else laugh very much. The proof can be seen in the ""bleh"" box office. I left the theater after seeing this adaptation wondering what went so wrong. The Heart of Gold was there. Marvin the robot was there. Zaphod was there. Arthur was certainly there. There were jokes. There was physical comedy. I rolled it around a few days and realized what was missing. Comedians.Comedians were sadly missing and the void wasn't filled with much to laugh about. Mos Def isn't a very good rapper, not that great on a good day in a good movie and was just an awful choice for Ford Prefect (Although Hollywood and NPR seem to love the little guy). The scene in the air lock where for a brief second he fiddles with knobs and you get the feeling he is going to get he and Arthur out of the jam. Only for him to turn and say he's not. In the book, that was funny. Mos Def mumbled his lines with absolutely no funniness or life whatsoever. I mean really, didn't they have the guy read for the role? 10 seconds of his monotone, lifeless reading of the dialog would have told the producers to move on to someone better. Martin Freeman as Arthur was sort of better, but didn't really seem all that interested in the role. Slartibartfast, delivering the one line that was funny in the book, the one where he introduces himself. Bill Nighy fell flat on the one joke no one else could have possibly failed to get across. But again he's no comedian and I ask, didn't they have him read for this role? The voice of the guide was a good choice, excellent even, as was Alan Rickman as the voice of Marvin. Zaphod was given a very lackluster treatment by Sam Rockwell. Zaphod needed more ""oomph"" that Rockwell didn't deliver. The way they handled the extra head was again lackluster. I wonder if it was bad directing, as I know Sammie boy had it in him to give that character a presence on screen. Did any of the actors even bother to read Douglas's work?I would have liked to have seen the same respect and attention to the original work in this movie that we saw in The Lord of the Rings. They really wanted to bring a great story to life on the screen and still keep integrity with the books. Sadly the makers of this movie just wanted to throw something together that would make box office simply on the loyalty of the fans. As proof of the lack of thought given to the endeavor, I refer you once again to the casting of Mos Def, because he was just the worst. I rated this movie a 5 out of 10 only because it was good to see a visual on a story thats been in my head all these years. I only wish the studio would issue a ""do-over"" film that actually cast some people who know how to deliver the funny Douglas wrote into the characters.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
1065,sjstamps,"Mostly Disappointed,",2,4 December 2005,"I guess I could only be disappointed, but I was surprised how much this film has been ""Hollywood-ised"", for no good reason in my view.It also shows how good the original casting and acting of the original BBC Radio and TV series was (with probably 1% of the budget of this film). So, with say 100x the money they produced a film no better that the BBC TV original...The original characters were already sufficiently OTT caricatures (eg; Arther Dents British middle-class sarcasm, Zaphod confidently up-himself without being too OTT) that they didn't need to change them, and then to add unnecessary bits like the love triangle just dilutes the quality of the original writing. Its a shame they just couldn't keep the Hollywood-cookie-cutter in the drawer this time, especially as they knew they had such a good original book in this case.Shame. This has just reminded me how much media these days, good or bad, all tends to get merged into the same middle-ground set of ""lets-hit-all-the-buttons"" list of objectives, at the expense of good (and bad) scripts or original ideas. ShamePS - I have lot of respect for Stephen Fry, and he (or John Cleese) was an obvious choice for ""The Book"", but neither could have done justice to the excellent job done by (now sadly departed) Peter Jones in the original - again excellent original casting. At least they managed to keep the graphics for ""the book"" in the original style, without updating to reflect the latest technology or GUI style.

It was so amazingly great and I thought that finally some people will put the means and effort to make the movie as good as the book is.Unfortunately it doesn't seem to be at all what I expected.

I have thought of Ford as white, odd colored eyes and odd shaped head.3) Mr Fry was lucky to have voice-overs.

I think if Douglas Adams were alive today, he would borrow a phrase from Harlan Ellison and call it a ""thalidomide abortion"" of his original story. Adams' writing was snappy and sharp, full of dry and acerbic wit.

1071,gobaskof,The worst film of all time?,1,15 January 2006,"The main problem with the film was not its plot (even though its plot wasn't the greatest), because this film needed no real plot. The books only had a very vague plot yet they were fantastic.The main problem with this film was its lack of proper hitchhikers style comedy. The book, radio series and TV series all we brilliant because of the style of the humour. Each scene was almost a separate comedy sketch. Unfortuantly in the film they cut most of Douglas Adams great work. (It might have been different if he had still been alive when the film was made RIP). An example of this.Text from the book:""I eventually had to go down to the cellar to find them."" ""That's the Display Department."" ""With a torch."" ""The lights had probably gone."" ""So had the stairs."" ""But you found the plans, didn't you?"" ""Oh yes, they were 'on display' in the bottom of a locked filing cabinet stuck in a disused lavatory with a sign on the door saying 'Beware of the leopard.'""Or, as the movie version has it:""I eventually had to go down to the cellar to find them."" ""But you found the plans, didn't you?""Do you notice the lack of comedy in the film? I do. The film carries on like this, unfortunately. You might say 'but if they left all the script in the film would be too long' To that i argue they should have cut some of the plot. Every version of Hitchhikers has had differences in the plot, and no one really minds as long as you follow the basic story. But i never dreamed anyone would make a version of hitchhikers that has a totally different idea of comedy.The 1981 TV series had very limited special effects and a much smaller budget, yet still managed to be funny.FILM Rating: HARMLESS (a joke for all those who have read/listened/watched any other version)",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

1078,acsteckman,A great movie was right there for the taking,5,22 June 2021,"To quote William Hurt from A History of Violence, ""How do you &#!? That up?!?"". Nothing frustrates me more than a movie that could have been a classic yet makes critical, easily avoidable mistakes to ruin it.IMO the screenplay is actually excellent. The book has a lot of humor that only really works in written form as it unfolds to the reader. And these jokes are the most memorable e.g. The story of the universe beginning and being regarded as a ""bad idea"" the history of Vogon poetry. But the use of a narrator to describes these situations solves that problem deftly. Unfortunately the people making the movie screwed up the easiest part. Basic casting and how to deliver dry humor. I love Zooey but she completely misplays her character. She should be tough, confident, sparkling, sweet and cheerful and instead she just plays her basic New Girl persona. It just doesn't work and the results are disappointing. She should be a scene stealer and instead she is the personality that grinds a conversation to a halt when she speaks. But she is no match for the biggest casting mistake which is Mos Def as Ford Prefect. Again, this character should be chewing the scenery like a starving goat and he should be larger than life. Instead mumbles his lines(seriously, did he just come from getting dental work done?) and he absolutely cannot do this type of humor. Which brings us to the final problem. The directors understanding of how dry humor is delivered. And to be fair to Zooey and Mos, the overall poor delivery of all the characters is potentially the fault of a director how to handle the material. Almost every single joke other than the ones done by the narrator is delivered wrong. You have to ""sell"" dry and rhetorical humor jokes. And this does not happen. The emphasis always seems to be on the wrong word. Instead of funny the joke comes out morose and sad. Bill Nighy's line readings are the best example of this failure (or worst depending on how you look at it). HE COULDN'T EVEN GET THE SIGHING OF THE DOORS RIGHT! He gives them a sad sigh instead of a contented one. Alan Rickman gets it right, Sam Rockwell does his best as a wildman (and since his lines are a different type of humor his work doesn't suffer the same failing as the others) and Martin Freeman does well. I would actually live to have been on set to see who was the person to actually screw this up. Because a the actors and actresses have done amazing jobs in other films. I picture them doing the lines one way and then the director saying ""Nah. Let's try this"" while the actors roll their eyes and think ""Fine, I'm still getting paid at least"". I sincerely believe you could make the film 75 percent better just by rerecording the jokes properly and dub the original.
