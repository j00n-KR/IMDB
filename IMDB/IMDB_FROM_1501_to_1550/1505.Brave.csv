0,MartinHafer,The CGI was incredible!,7,21 June 2012,"While I must admit that ""Brave"" is not among my favorite Pixar films, I was totally blown away by the computer graphics. To some extent this is to be expected--as years pass, the CGI is bound to get better and better. But it's more than that--the textures, colors and depth were all incredible and I was in love with the animation throughout.As far as the story goes, it was a mixed bag. While I was thrilled to see a Pixar film with female leads AND featuring a mother-daughter relationship, the story itself seemed a bit shallow and flat. It wasn't bad, but never hit that emotional spot within that you'd find in ""Up"" or ""Toy Story 3"". Now this isn't to say it's bad---it just isn't among the very best of the studio and is STILL well worth seeing. It's especially nice to see a FEMALE protagonist--and one who does NOT need to be rescued by a prince! Incidentally, my daughter and her friend loved the film--and my bet is that girls would generally prefer this film but it's a lot of fun for everyone.By the way, there is a cute inside joke in the film in which they mention someone being out of town at the ""Wicker Man"" ceremony! This could be a reference to the wonderful 1970s film (see this one--not the remake) or to the actual ancient ceremony. I actually had no idea that this was a real event until dlwagner sent me an email informing me of this--but I certainly did NOT expect to hear them talking about it in ""Brave"".",Brave
1,TheLittleSongbird,"Not among Pixar's finest, but solid family fun regardless",8,16 August 2012,"I have always loved Pixar's films, they are charming, funny, full of heart and have identifiable characters, strong stories and gorgeous animation on the whole. I was strongly anticipating Brave as I would do for any animated movie, and while I still enjoyed it very much I was a little disappointed as well. Ranking it with Pixar's other films, I don't consider Brave as good as the Toy Story films, Up, Monsters Inc, Finding Nemo and WALL-E, but I consider it better than the Cars films(which I did like actually) and put it on the same level as Bug's Life(Pixar's most underrated), Ratatouille and The Incredibles.Does Brave have flaws? I personally do think so. The dialogue does get better later on but felt rather cheesy and awkward to start with. The story is still entertaining, polishedly told and is solidly paced but just lacks the heart of previous Pixars and comes across as old-fashioned in places. The kingdom's menfolk are also clichéd, and as much as I hate to say it unfortunately some of the clichés came across as lazy to me.Starting with the best asset of Brave though, the animation is simply amazing. The Scottish countryside is beautifully shaded and very evocative and Merida's hair is very life-like. The colours look gorgeous also, and the characters are well modelled. The music score is beautiful in its Celtic lilt and haunting in the atmosphere it creates in the forest. While not as good to start with, the writing does at least have some pitfalls and gags to amuse children and adults alike with the more dramatic/intense moments unforced and convincing. The main characters are engaging. I was especially taken with Merida, you don't relate with her in the way you do with WALL-E but I liked that instead of her having the predictable romantic fate of the Disney Princesses(no offense intended, I love those movies) and potentially dull as dishwater, she is very headstrong and actually matures throughout the film. The Witch and the mother are also well done characters. The voice acting is great. Kelly MacDonald is very spirited as Merida, and Emma Thompson is a sympathetic mother figure. Julie Walters is appropriately formidable as the Witch, and Robbie Coltrane amuses. Billy Conolly is a somewhat predictable casting choice- when you think Scotland Conolly immediately comes into your head- but his great sense of comic timing and exuberance still delights to not make that matter too much.In conclusion, rock solid family fun but not Pixar at their best. 8/10 Bethany Cox",Brave
2,SnoopyStyle,Pixar does it again,8,1 September 2013,"Merida (Kelly Macdonald) is a tomboy princess in ancient Scotland. She is the best archer, but she is being forced to act proper as a princess. One day, she makes a reckless choice that unleashes unintended peril and forces her to spring into action to set things right. Other voiceworks include Billy Connolly and Emma Thompson as the king and queen.There has been some complaints about Kelly Macdonald's performance using a deliberately high voice. I don't agree with those complaints. First she is playing a child. Second it's a cartoon. I don't understand the difference between this and the vast history of cartoon voices. The story is mostly the new princess formula. There's nothing wrong with that either.",Brave
3,claudio_carvalho,Motherly Affection,7,26 November 2012,"In Scotland, the rebel Princess Merida is a skilled archery raised by her mother Queen Elinor in accordance with the traditions of the Kingdom of Dun Broch. Her father King Fergus lost part of one of his legs eaten by the fearful bear Mar'du and dreams on slaying the animal. In accordance with the costumes, Merida shall marry the first-born of the lords of her kingdom. Lord Dingwall, Lord MacGuffin and Lord Macintosh bring their sons to dispute the princess in a competition among them. Merida lures the first-born and flees to the forest where she meets a witch. She asks a spell to change her mother and the witch prepares a small cake to give to her. When her mother eats a slice of the cake, she is turned into a bear and Fergus mistakenly takes her as being Mor'du. Now Merida has to fix her spell but the witch has traveled and she has only one day to bring her mother back.""Brave"" is a highly entertaining animation from Disney / Pixar, with the enjoyable story of motherly affection, with a rebel princess that makes a wrong choice that serves to show her how much her mother loves her. There are funny moments, with the practical jokes of the three young brothers, the crow and the witch's broom, and the conclusion is well resolved. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Valente"" (""Brave"")",Brave
4,nogodnomasters,IT'S MARRIAGE. IT'S NOT THE END OF THE WORLD,7,20 July 2018,"The graphics is great on yet another Disney princess film. The film starts out with some deep themes. Mom attempts to mold Merida into her expectations of her being a princess. Merida is daddy's girl and a tomboy. When it comes times for suitors, the 15 year old rebels against her mother to win her freedom to choose her own life. This was all great as the classic female roles are being broken, a reflection of today's world. I was really enjoying the film.After this great start the film digresses into magic and witchcraft. Now I have nothing against either one, it is just at this point the film loses track of the theme and becomes needlessly silly and moves off into a new direction and creates a kids version of ""The Monkey's Paw"" i.e. be careful what you wish for. The preteen kids will enjoy it, I can't imagine adults getting too excited.",Brave
5,kosmasp,Fairy tale,9,17 September 2012,"Right up front you should know before you watch this: It's not ""How to train your Dragon"". In other words it's not as much a comedy as it is a fairy tale. I think the trailer was clear on that, but quite a lot of people seem to have been expecting different. Plus jokes do not equal story! I do understand if that is something that bothers people with the movie (like a friend of mine who told me, that he liked the Dragon movie better).Having said that, this still has comedy elements in it and you will laugh. But as with all the Pixar movies, they are concerned about the story. And while this sort of fairy tale has been told quite a few times, they still find fresh ways to tell the story. Which is quite simply amazing. The 3-D might not be that amazing, though you shouldn't take your glasses off halfway through the movie and then take it out on the movie (or the filmmakers for that matter).The voices are really good (some real Scottish talent at work including the one and only Craig Ferguson) and I loved the animation. Pixar itself can be called ""brave"" for not only tackling the fairy tale this way, but going female lead on us. And again they made it work ...",Brave
6,classicsoncall,"""And may the lucky arrow find it's target.""",7,11 May 2014,"I'm reading a handful of the reviews for this movie and it seems that a fair number of criticisms of the film have to do with Merida being essentially a spoiled brat for standing up against her mother Elinor. This leaves me scratching my head a bit because the last time I looked, it's the twenty-first century, and arranged marriages would be another one of those volleys in the so called war on women. If I were Merida, I wouldn't have wanted anything to do with either of the three clan rivals that might have ended up as her husband. Fortunately, the mother-daughter dynamic is set right again when a witch's spell casts Elinor into a bear, and in the second half of the film, Merida does all she can to restore her mother back to human form. Not to mention her mischievous brothers. Which by the way, when my five year old granddaughter saw them eat the magic cake, she immediately knew they would turn into bear cubs. Not too bad a job of drawing conclusions for a five year old.I'm not too big into animated feature films but generally enjoy them once I tune in. This was no exception, as the story did a competent job of demonstrating how our fate lives within us and it's up to us to choose our own destiny. Merida is a role model with a bit more substance than simply being beautiful and waiting for a handsome prince to come along to make life a happily ever after affair.",Brave
7,gavin6942,A More or Less Average Film,6,11 February 2013,"Determined to make her own path in life, Princess Merida defies a custom that brings chaos to her kingdom. Granted one wish, Merida must rely on her bravery and her archery skills to undo a beastly curse.The people who select the Golden Globes winners... something is very, very wrong with them. Somehow this film became the winner of the Golden Globe for animation. Now, maybe the vote was split on two others and this one sneaked through... but I think somehow they thought it was the best. It is anything but.Having now seen the five Oscar nominees for best animated feature, I sincerely hope this film does not walk away with the award. While it has a strong feminist message that may appeal to young women (which is good), the overall plot is your standard Disney story: girl gets in disagreement with parents and rebels, has to learn that she was wrong. We saw this in ""Little Mermaid"", to some degree in ""Beauty and the Beast""... it is nothing new.The animation is well done, that is true. But even if we judge the film only on technical merits, it would have to compete with the other nominees. Add in actual plot and a level of innovation and fun, and this one is nothing -- ""ParaNorman"" and ""Wreck-It Ralph"" are clearly better films, and even ""Pirates"" is probably the greater contribution to cinema.The title and concept are confusing. Being called ""Brave"" and taking place in Scotland made me think it was a Disney version of ""Braveheart"". No. Not even close. The plot says she has to use her bravery and archery... well, sort of. But it is not actually an important aspect of the story.This is a film you can play for your kids if you want the television to babysit them. But it is not a new Disney classic by any means.",Brave
8,lee_eisenberg,Scotland and its fantasies,5,21 January 2018,"""Brave"" is very much unlike most Disney movies. Its princess not only wants to break tradition: she wants to go out and do things on her own, even to the chagrin of her parents. I guess that part of what was most enjoyable about it was the setting in medieval Scotland, complete with lots of Celtic imagery (and they made sure to have a mostly Scottish cast: Kelly Macdonald, Billy Connolly, Robbie Coltrane and Craig Ferguson, among others).Admittedly, there are some goofs - as revealed on the YouTube series Cinema Sins - but overall I thought that it was a respectable movie (and I say this as someone who's not usually into Disney movies). As to the issue of whether it deserved to win Best Animated Feature, I did think that ""Frankenweenie"" was the cooler movie.Even so, worth seeing.",Brave
9,jboothmillard,Brave,7,18 December 2012,"This was a different for Walt Disney Pictures and Pixar Animation Studios, because for Pixar it would be the first story to see a more ancient world (and not Americanised), and for Disney it would see the first female lead character to be the heroine, I was looking forward to seeing how it would turn out. Basically, set in Scotland, young princess Merida (Peigi Barker), daughter of King Fergus of Clan Dunbroch (Billy Connolly), is given a bow for her birthday, and while she is practising with it she distracted seeing a wisp that leads her into the woods and a giant demon bear that attacks the family, she and her mother Queen Elinor (Emma Thompson) get away unharmed, but Fergus loses his left leg. Years later teenage Merida (Trainspotting's Kelly Macdonald) is a free spirit and has three younger triplet brothers, Hamish, Harris and Hubert, but she is unhappy with the idea that she is to be married to one of the sons of the clans her father is allied with, despite being warned that it could harm the future of the kingdom if she does not marry. The first born sons from the clans of Lord Macintosh (Craig Ferguson), Lord MacGuffin (Kevin McKidd) and Lord Dingwall (Robbie Coltrane) arrive to compete for Merida's hand in the Highland Games, but she declares she can compete as well in the archery, and this causes her and Elinor to have a big argument, to the point when the daughter slashes the family tapestry and her mother burns her daughter's bow. Merida runs away into the forest, and she follows a trail of wisps, they lead her to the elderly Witch (Julie Walters) who poses as a wood carver in her hut, and after some bargaining and payment the old crone agrees to give her a spell to change things, this is in the form of a cake that she will give her mother. Returning to the castle Merida gives Elinor the cake as some kind of apology gift, and rather than changing her mother's opinion of the marriage she has transformed her mother into a large black bear, and obviously Fergus will hunt and kill any bears that may endanger his family. With the help of the triplet brothers Merida and Elinor escape the castle and run to the woods, and they eventually find the deserted Witch's hut in the forest, but all that is there is a cauldron with a potion to give her a riddle as to how to break the spell, ""mend the bond torn by pride"", and if this is not done by the second sunrise the Elinor will become a bear both physically and in personality forever. Merida thinks that this riddle means that she should repair the tapestry she damaged, so they make plans, and surviving in the forest the two of them start to work out their previously somewhat parted relationship as mother and daughter, but this is difficult as in moments the bear side of Elinor comes out. Seeing some more wisps they are led to the ancient ruins where they discover more about the prince of Elinor's legend, the story was true and Mor'du was really turned into a bear by the same spell of the Witch, and after escaping an attack from him they head for the castle to put their plan into action. The clans are arguing about the princess marriage and who should be the young man to take her hand, and distracting them from seeing her mother as a bear Merida defends herself and gets them to see that children should be allowed to marry whoever they want in their own time, and then Merida goes to get the tapestry and has her mother turn wild for a moment again. Fergus sees the bear and instantly wants to kill it, and Elinor is chased out of the castle by the king and the party, while Merida's brothers, who also ate the cake and have turned into bear cubs, help her to get out of her room when locked in, and she fixes the tapestry and rides out to save her mother. The clan members have caught Elinor, but Merida gets to the spot in time to stop them killing her, and then Mor'du shows up to attack them, but after a fight he is flattened by one of the rocks in a circle, and the prince's spirit is released. When it looks like the queen may be dying and the sun is rising, Merida places the tapestry over and cries as she hugs what may become a real wild bear, but the sunlight hits and Elinor is transformed back into a human, along with the triplets, and all bonds are restored, oh, and (seen after the credits) all the wood carvings the princess bought are delivered to the kingdom. Also starring Sally Kinghorn as Maudie and John Ratzenberger as Gordon. Macdonald gives a feisty voice to the brave alternative princess, Thompson is good at being uppity in her scenes, Connolly is of course the suitable Scottish voice for the king, and Walters in her moments adds some of the humour as the eccentric sorceress. The story is a simple enough tale that sees a family and kingdom dwellers in feuds and trying to find a way to bring them together, the mother and daughter falling out and bonding concept is nice, the spell of a woman turned to a bear and trying to help it is classic, there is a good amount of adventure to overlap the clichés, and the animation is of course on top form, a great fun family animated fairy tale. It is nominated the Golden Globe for Best Animated Film. Very good!",Brave
10,Tweekums,Disney/Pixar go to the Highlands,7,30 December 2015,"This Disney/Pixar film is set in the Scottish Highlands where Princess Merida doesn't enjoy princessly things; instead she enjoys riding, archery and climbing the local mountains. After one such outing she returns to discover that the leaders of three local clans are to visit so she can choose which of their sons she will marry she isn't given the option of choosing none. After an argument with her mother she rides off and finds herself at a witch's cottage; she asks the witch to change her mother; hoping to find a way of avoiding marriage the spell works but not how she expected; it turns her mother into a bear! If that wasn't bad enough her father is famed as a bear-killer! She tries to return to the witch but she is out; she has left a cryptic message though; Merida will have to solve it quickly if the spell isn't to become permanent.This may be a Disney/Pixar film but it feels more Disney than Pixar not that that is a bad thing. This is largely due to having a lead character who is a feisty princess. The story is fun if fairly basic and has the sort of moral one might expect. The action is impressive and at times genuinely scary although not too scary for young viewers. As one would expect from Pixar the film looks great; Merida's curly red hair looks amazing and moves naturally whatever she is doing. The characters are likable; especially Merida and her amusing father. The cast do a fine job; Kelly Macdonald impresses as Merida although Billy Connolly's performance as her father is probably the most memorable thanks to his distinctive voice and amusing character. Overall a solid film which has a good balance of action and humour; it may not be the masterpiece many Pixar films are but I've yet to see a Pixar film that I didn't enjoy.",Brave
11,tavm,Brave is another highly entertaining computer animated feature from Disney/Pixar,9,26 June 2012,"Another year, another highly enjoyable Disney/Pixar computer animated feature for the summer. In this one, Princess Merida does NOT want to be chosen for marriage to whoever wins the archery contest as she just wants to be the victor of said contest for herself. Her mother, on the other hand, keeps trying to mold her into what is expected of the certain female royal offspring when she grows up. I'll stop there and just say that what happens after what I just described brings quite of bit of uneasiness between the two but also brings them together and changes both for the better. Not as many laughs as in previous Pixar movies but there are some awesome thrills and quite a touching climax that I really don't want to reveal here. Really, all I'll say is Pixar has done it again with Brave. So, yes, that's a high recommendation!",Brave
12,michaelRokeefe,Angst of young adulthood.,5,20 October 2014,"This is a Pixar animated feature about a young princess in the Scottish Highlands. Princess Merida(voiced by Kelly Macdonald)is a young girl in a struggle finding her way through young adulthood. She does not see eye to eye with her parents,(why is that not a surprise)an aspiring archer and despises her royal parents for forcing her hand in marriage. In her disgust, Merida accidentally riles the anger of the ancient land's three esteemed lords; and in doing so the impetuous young lady makes some very poor choices that brings about unintended havoc that requires involvement with a sorcerer.This movie is very nice to look at. Scenes of the Scottish Highlands are stunning. The story line seems too familiar. And I just don't think this project is one of Pixar's shining moments. Although family fare, I can see BRAVE being more popular with a juvenile, pre-teen female audience. Needless to say, this movie should have no fear in not making money. A host of talented stars lend voices to make these characters come alive: Billy Connolly, Emma Thompson, Robbie Coltrane, Craig Ferguson, John Ratzenberger, Kevin McKidd and Julie Walters.",Brave
13,studioAT,An average Pixar film,4,2 June 2013,"Pixar's reputation goes before them and any film that they produce is instantly going to be compared to their classic films such as Toy Story and Monsters Inc.Brave marked somewhat of a return from Pixar to original ideas after the very successful Toy Story 3 and perhaps the lesser hit Cars 2. With all the hallmarks that we love about previous Pixar films in place this film is well worthy of the praise it gained upon release.It's great that at long last we have a lead character who is female and for the mother/daughter relationship being explored. Visually the film is great and the storyline is fast moving and emotive.My only negative points about it is that despite the main characters being very well fleshed out and developed there are no secondary characters to provide as many comic relief moments and those that are, aren't that funny.Overall the elements are all there but for me Brave does not match up to the very high standards that Pixar have set prior.",Brave

15,LeonLouisRicci,Pixar's First Fizzel,4,21 November 2012,"This is the first fizzle from Pixar and for that it is a huge disappointment. Trying a turn to the more classic storyline of Princesses and a Once Upon a Time concept was not very courageous but ultimately a process that was rendered somewhat bland and unmemorable.This is a surprisingly stiff and boring story that has zero depth and uninteresting characters. The clunky bears are not frightening when they need to be or endearing when they try to be. The look of the film is dull and clichéd along with redundant flourishes (like the witch in the cauldron straight out of A.I. (Dr.Know).It is not a total bomb but is forgettable silliness and routine rowdiness. There is very little suspense and even the youngsters will most likely get bored. Except maybe the young boys who will be seduced by flowing red hair, which is the only thing that endures from this misfire where her uncanny archery is seldom used for anything more than a prop and some much needed activity and even that is sluggish.",Brave
16,grantss,Only for kids,4,8 December 2015,"A movie only for kids, and girls in particular.Set in Scotland in medieval times, a young princess, Merida, grows up to be quite independent (and very proficient with bow and arrow!). Her mother tries to marry her off, but she refuses. In frustration at her mother dictating her life, she has a witch put a spell on her mother. Unfortunately, it doesn't come out as planned...Mostly quite silly and dull. Cheap jokes, random plot, scenes that are plain pointless.It has some redeeming qualities, though these are more than negated by the farce. There is a theme of female empowerment and independence, but this is undermined by our independent and (wanting to be) empowered female deciding that the way to gain her independence was by putting a spell on her mother! Hardly the best lesson for girls.This movie (undeservedly) won the Best Animated Feature Oscar in 2013. How it beat Wreck-It-Ralph and Frankenweenie, both of which are far better movies, goodness knows.",Brave
17,Boba_Fett1138,Not entirely successful but it works in most ways.,7,23 June 2012,"Overall, I really liked watching this movie but it certainly was not without its flaws and weaknesses.It was good to see a bit of a different animated movie for a change. I feel that this was a more mature movie, with both its story and humor. The emphasis is really put on its story and themes this time, rather than on its comedy and other distractions. And I feel that the movie did a pretty good job with its whole mother/daughter relationship theme, which felt very real and heartfelt and to me was what the whole movie was all about.Thing I also like about the story is that it's being an original one, in the sense that it isn't based on any fairytale or well known story. It's an entirely original story, that still feels in the vein of for instance a brothers Grimm classic.But having said all of that, the story still feels far from perfect. I for one wasn't too fond of its second half, in which the mother 'changes' and the movie starts to become an almost entirely different one. It besides could had used some more conflicts in it. For instance, there now isn't even being a villain in this movie at all and at times the story feels too straightforward and simplistic, as if the writers were in a hurry to finish it on time and had to leave out a whole bunch of ideas, that could had made this movie a bit of a deeper and more entertaining one as well.The animations are really great. I liked the look of the movie and all of its characters. You could also definitely tell some serious time and effort went into all of it, which was all really worth it.Despite of the movie its weaknesses, I overall still really liked watching it and therefore can also really recommend watching this movie!7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Brave
18,george.schmidt,Vibrant and fun animated tale from the geniuses at Pixar focusing on a heroine for a change as the protagonist; genuine warmth for a family picture.,10,1 July 2012,"BRAVE (2012) **** (VOICES: Kelly Macdonald, Billy Connolly, Emma Thompson, Julie Walters, Robbie Coltrane, Kevin McKidd, Craig Ferguson). Vibrant and fun animated tale from the geniuses at Pixar focusing on a heroine for a change as the protagonist - Merida (feistily voiced by Macdonald) - a Scottish princess whose desire to be independent only faces more and more adversity when her royal family decides its time for her courtship to commence despite her fervent wish to be her own person. Gorgeously animated and directed with skill by Mark Andrews, Brenda Chapman and Steve Purcell - who collaborated on the spry screenplay with Irene Mecchi - the universal tale of a love between a mother and daughter are wonderfully presented with fierce clear-eyed clarity and genuine warmth for a family picture. *the 3D also adds to the storybook appeal with fantastic vistas* *And Pixar you may want to consider a live-action version after checking out Tara Cardinal - a dead ringer for Merida - in the forthcoming Legend of the Red Reaper :D",Brave
19,view_and_review,I Expected So Much Better,5,30 December 2015,"I haven't seen a Disney princess movie in years; I'd say since Aladdin came out on video. And to be honest, because I hadn't read anything about this movie I didn't know that this was a princess movie.Allow me to be in the minority and say that I did not like it. I didn't know where the movie was going to start but it had my interest. Once it became evident that Merida (Kelly MacDonald) was a princess and that her mother was forcing her into the typical princess role I kinda knew where the movie was going. Enter a witch with a spell/potion to fix the princess' problem and there is your drama.The movie was very formulaic and unimaginative. Even the actual spell she asked for was quite lame: ""Give me a spell to change my fate."" How generic is that? That could mean absolutely anything.So, what did we have? Troubled princess, witch with a solution, conflict, climax, resolution (just in the nick of time in Disneyan fashion). Yes, there were some funny parts and yes, there were some cute characters; but overall it just didn't move the needle.",Brave
20,neil-476,"Very good, but not great",8,17 August 2012,"Pixar's latest feature tells of Merida (voiced by Kelly McDonald), the daughter of mediaeval Scots chieftain Fergus (Billy Connolly) and his wife Elinor (Emma Thompson). Fergus is happy to indulge his firstborn's tomboy inclinations, but Elinor is minded that the girl will need to wed in order to provide a bond between potentially warring clans. The trouble is that Merida has a mind and will of her own and, when she meets the possibility that there might be a magical solution to changing her mother's single-mindedness, well, that's a difficult temptation to resist, isn't it? There is much to enjoy here - it is a visual feast, the characters are all entertaining and well conceived and realised, and the basic idea (much of which recalls the conflict between Ariel and Triton in The Little Mermaid) contains sufficient drama, conflict and suspense to drive the narrative.The trouble is that I think the script may not have been as thoroughly worked as is normally the case with Pixar because, after an engaging opening, there are far too many flat areas, times when I found myself thinking that I got the point, now get on with it (Merida and Elinor escaping from the castle, for one). And I also found myself wishing for a bigger and better payoff. Don't get me wrong - I enjoyed it but, knowing what Pixar is capable of, I thought the film's heart was not as strong as it should have been.Merida's hair is, however, absolutely wonderful, and she is the latest in a line of animated heroines with whom I am totally besotted.",Brave
21,morrison-dylan-fan,The Bear and the Bow,10,3 September 2012,"Two days before a friends 26th birthday,I began to franticly search for films playing at local cinema's,which he could happily watch with his friends and family.Searching round the cinema listing's a number of times,I suddenly noticed that the wonderful Pixar studio had just brought out their newest movie.Remembering how much everyone had enjoyed seeing Toy Story 3 in cinema,I began to make last minute preparations,for everyone to have a chance to witness Pixar's magical travel's in the Scottish highlands.The plot:Despite repeatedly being told by their daughter that she is not yet prepared to give her hand in marriage,King Fergus and Queen Elinor tell their daughter Merida that she must follow tradition and get wed to the young man who wins the currently being held Highland Games,Angered by her parents refusal to listen to anything she says,Merida tears up the family's treasured tapestry and runs off to the near by woods.Wondering around the woods,Merida finds a trail being lit by rows of will-o'-the- wisp's to a cottage deep in the heart of the woods.Carfully entering the cottage,Merida is given the flight of her life when a witch appears from out of nowhere.Initially being desperate to leave the cottage as fast as possible,Merida begins to change her mind,when the witch tells her that she has the skills to create a spell which will completely change her mother forever.View on the film:Spending the first 40 minutes being hit on the head with ads for cheap toys,I began to grip the sides of the chair in the hope of eventually reaching some sort of oasis.Cheerfully,from the very first scene of the film,Pixar show that they have created a truly breath taking paradise,with the vast,perfectly handled,wide tracking shots fully displaying the impeccably detailed Scottish Highlands that are covered in grass that looks just like real life and displays no sign at all of pixels.Having heard about the ""troubled"" history of the film's production ,(original co-writer/director Brenda Chapman got fired during production over ""creative differences"") I was pleased to discover that any ""back stage troubles"" were kept behind the curtain,with director's Chapman,Mark Andrews and Steve Purcell, (who also co-wrote the screenplay,along with Irene Mecchi) having the film move at a tremendous break-neck speed,which whilst never forgetting to have the wonderfully sassy Merida as the centre of the movie,also culminates in an epic,edge of the seat final battle,that is truly as exciting as anything which will be offered in ""live action"" films this year.Unvailing the spell that the witch has made to make Merida's mum change her mind forever,the writer's run a real risk of the movie falling into looking embarrassing and being a badly done parody of Beauty & The Beast.Impressivly,the screenwriter's stop the film from ever tipping over by having the relationship between Merida and her parents never being sickly sweet,to instead feel much more heartfelt and also handling ""the spell"" in a cheerful,delicate manner that pulls the viewer into seeing Merida and her parents try to repair their torn tapestry.As the film's closing credits appeared,the very first feeling I had was looking forward to revisiting Pixar's Brave new world and again becoming completely enchanted by their magical tale.",Brave
22,anaconda-40658,Brave Mistake by Pixar.,4,25 June 2015,"Brave (2012): Dir: Mark Andrews, Brenda Chapman / Voices: Kelly Macdonald, Billy Connolly, Emma Thompson, Julie Walters, Robbie Coltrane: Disappointing venture by Pixar that presents everything seen before, all wrapped in dazzling computer generated images of the highest splendor. It regards a Princess who braves herself against the traditional views of her mother who desires that she get married to one of the three suitors competing for her. She also braves herself when struggling to correct a wrong action that resulted in her mother being turned into a bear. This occurred when she sought assistance in her independence from a witch. It also seems quite convenient that the King's leg is now pegged thanks to a bear attack. So, we know where this is headed and it lacks any originality that flourished in the Toy Story films, among others by Pixar. The film is well directed by Mark Andrews and Brenda Chapman with a strong portrayal of an independent minded Princess voiced by Kelly Macdonald. Some have called this an attack on marriage while others call it one's right for independence. Other characters are traced impersonations of past Disney characters. We have the bear hunting King with the boring heroic story. The Queen will go from being a bear, to understanding her daughter's desires, as if we couldn't see that coming. Even the creepy little witch seems like a xerox seen countless times. This is not Pixar at its best. It seems to lack what made their earlier films stand out. While its message of independence is strong, it is evident that it went totally independent on originality. Score: 4 ½ / 10",Brave
23,movieman_kev,"Falls short of Up, but still fantastic",9,2 July 2012,"I took my two year old to see this on opening weekend and we both loved it, possibly me a tad more than her. The animation was amazing as is a natural for Pixar. The story (which i dare not spoil, as it's all the better going into the film not knowing) was heart-melting at times, I won't lie and tell you that I didn't start to tear up during a few scenes. The comedic parts of the film work spectacularly well, and while this film falls sort of the sheer greatness of Up, it's still the best children's films I've seen in years. If you have kids GO!! If you're a kid-at-heart GO!! Even if you enjoy a good movie go see this, not only a great kids film, but a great film period",Brave
24,zetes,"May not be Pixar's best, but still very good",8,24 June 2012,"While this doesn't quite rank alongside Pixar's very best work, it's very good. Animation-wise, I'd say it definitely ranks high up there, and it may even be their best. I could never successfully say how much I love Princess Merida's hair, for instance. It's just gorgeous, and used so perfectly in the film. Both the landscapes and the character animations are truly awe-inspiring. The flaws are in the writing, but they hardly destroy the movie. The story is too simple, too predictable. Major plot points happen too quickly and problems are solved a bit too easily. And it is perhaps a bit too slapsticky. I think Pixar was scared they couldn't get boys in the theater with their female protagonist, so they included a lot of lowbrow comedy. However, I would say it was never that bothersome to me. For the most part, I laughed when they wanted me to laugh. And I cried when they wanted me to cry. It is an involving story, and the mother/daughter relationship which is the focus is touching. Kelly MacDonald is wonderful in the lead (loved her forever, and so glad she replaced Reese Witherspoon) and Emma Thompson matches her in the mother role. All in all, perhaps not a major work, but still very satisfying.",Brave
25,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Brave,10,11 August 2012,"Under tremendous pressure from being an offspring of one of the juggernauts in the CG animated film arena, Brave was courageous enough to go for the familiar that Disney had to offer, but done in Pixar's style. We have a female director in Brenda Chapman at the helm, who co-wrote the screenplay with Steve Purcell, Mark Andrews and Irene Mecchi, which like in fairy tales, takes place with Kings and Queens, Princesses and Princes, Witches and Magic Spells, rooted in old Scotland. It's Scottish and the filmmakers aren't apologetic about the heavy accents, and the protagonist is a teenage girl, which fits the mold of the famous princesses under Disney's fold. Fiercely independent with a mind of her own, and always eager to question, with a penchant to break tradition, Merida (voiced by Kelly Macdonald) isn't your typical demure princess, but like Disney princesses in recent years, have grown to encapsulate values of the modern woman, with abilities to equal, or even surpass, the many burly men, and none too burly peers, rather than to be the typical damsel in distress.This is probably the very first mother-daughter story arc for Pixar, and one of the rare few like The Invincibles and Ratatouille that has human protagonists. Chapman and team bring about a lot of female sensitivity when crafting the characters here, and this especially stands out in both Queen Elinor (Emma Thompson) and Merida of course, with the former being a proponent of tradition, and very much a stickler for protocol, that women in their position should know how to conduct themselves, and avail themselves for marriage to seal alliances and such. Merida on the other hand, is that quintessential tomboy, never batting an eyelid at scaling mountains and walls, or charging through the forests with her horse, and is a formidable archer to boot. Doted, she finds her birthright stifling, and most of the first act sees her self-sabotage at a Games conducted to find her a beau from three clans. This is natural avenue for comedy to happen given the varied abilities of her suitors, and the family background they come from.But the distinction in Brave, comes from the mother-daughter tussle, with both sides failing to appeal to the other to listen. In a rebellious response, Merida runs away from home, only to encounter the Witch (Julie Walters), whose help Merida enlists to conjure a magic cake in order to change her mom's attitude, but this of course presents something quite expected given the blatant clues left lying around. It's a classic tale of being careful with what you wish for, and then the tale of regret in desire a revert to what once was. It's not going to be easy, and with help from her triplet brothers (who inevitably are primed to steal the show, with spin off potential at the side), Merida has to make things right before the deadline of two sunrises.As always, Pixar's animation quality is impeccable, and the studio seemed to have cracked one of the holy grails in how vivid one can make a character's hair appear to be. This is no Tangled, and throughout the film you can really sense how Merida's bright red hair would have felt, with the action scenes providing much of a challenge for air, erm, hair flow, and you'd really be convince it's probably real hair up there on screen. The animals in the film, from horses to bears, are also very well detailed, and it's as close to what one would expect from the animal kingdom as possible. Like most animated films from Disney and Pixar, Brave also had some relatively off moments in its comical scenarios, given that for the most parts it's fairly dark in mood, with scenes that deal with the occult and magical beings.What I had enjoyed about the film, is how simple it took the notion of things happening for a reason, and made it a critical emotional punch. It boiled down to having a solid story and crafting characters whom you will care for, or grow to care about. And if you'd take a step back, you'd also probably realize that the magic cake did really make Merida's wish come true, albeit in a very roundabout fashion. Things may not seem like they are in effect at the time, but usually with the benefit of hindsight, you'd come to appreciate why certain things happened in a certain way to ultimately achieve the results one desires. The witch had her chance for redemption, given an earlier and grave mistake made that had effected a lower profile of a wood cover, and took it well, confident enough not to warrant any follow up scenes, except perhaps to fulfill a promise shown at the stinger at the end of credits.Merida, without a doubt, joins the ranks of the other classical Disney Princesses. Highly recommended!Like all Pixar feature films, I'd always look forward to the short film that precedes the main feature proper, and the tale here, La Luna, deals with a little boy's ingenuity, in a fantasy tale about how the Moon can change its look, thanks to a three-generation family of grandfather- father-son who have this thankless task of sweeping up reflective stars from the surface of the moon. Beneath the cute looking facades of the characters - the father with a bushy moustache and the grandfather with an incredibly long beard - this short film tells about how one finally becomes one's own man, with some support given from one's kin. Again this shows off Pixar's storytelling ability in making a touching film, sans spoken dialogue. Absolutely beautiful.",Brave
26,Mr-Fusion,Sadly homogenized,5,20 April 2015,"I dunno what to make of ""Brave"". It says PIXAR before the title, but this is very much a Disney movie, from the gags and rhythms right down to the cutesy tone. I think that's the biggest thing; it's just kinda generic. Which is disappointing because it's set in the underused Scotland (and features some really picturesque locales). But mostly, it's the weak story, and it feels surprisingly long for 90 minutes. There was some great buildup with Merida's archery, but no payoff for such an independent female warrior.It started out with promise, but falls right in line with ""Tangled"" and ""Frozen"" product.5/10",Brave
27,siderite,Animated film about family values... and bears,7,28 December 2012,"As expected of Pixar, the animation is top notch. The story, even if fairy talish and simplistic and typical Disney, is still a good one. Add Scottish accents and natural witchcraft and you get a cautionary tale of pride and family love.Now, the film is not perfect, far from it. The plot is simple, the silliness factor is through the roof and most characters are presented as lovable idiots. But I had fun watching Brave. It is made for kids and it shows, but as long as they've got their target audience right and the content to prove it, it's all good.Bottom line: not the best of Pixar's productions, but certainly a nice one.",Brave
28,StevePulaski,A subversive magic trick,8,16 November 2012,"I think Pixar's last two films have perfectly replicated how bipolar and easily disappointed a studio's fans can be when they decide to go in a different direction or, the second they make something they aren't fond of, they immediately lose all hope in them ever bouncing back. Of course I'm talking about the immense hate Cars 2 got last year and how obvious skepticism rang during the coming weeks of Brave's theatrical run.Cars 2 is, in my opinion, the weakest Pixar movie, but it still managed to earn a positive review from me due to its entertaining setup, kinetic energy, entertaining characters, and clear inspiration from Lasseter and everyone involved. It was pleasant entertainment, but lacked the emotional drama and the subversive narrative that recurred in a Pixar spectacle, not to mention, completely abandoning the original film's beautifully mosaic nostalgia and heavy themes of change and adapting to a new way of life. All and all, while fun, we can see one of the direct motivations to make the sequel was the original Cars film, while churning the lowest profits theatrically and being the first Pixar film to not garner a critical consensus of ""positive,"" grossed $8 billion in merchandise, and by making a sequel, they could usher in a new line of toys while welcoming huge profits commercially.Now comes Brave, unfortunately victim to the pungent aftertaste Cars 2 left in many audiences' mouths. Had this come out when the company just began, say 1998, instead of A Bug's Life, when Pixar hadn't even begun showing audiences what they could do, perhaps it would've been viewed differently. The story is simple enough; Merida (voiced by Kelly Macdonald) is the teenage daughter of King Fergus (Billy Connolly) and Queen Elinor (Emma Thompson) who is required to become a princess thanks to her mother's strict, unforgiving rules and the outdated traditions of the Scottish land. Her mother plans an arranged marriage between her and another man, while neglecting the fact that her daughter has a whole other agenda she wants to pursue. An agenda that allows her to be a free-spirited archer, and a brave, fearless woman of power.Thirty minutes into Brave left me somewhat underwhelmed. The animation, as expected, was evoking and extravagant, but the storyline screamed Disney instead of Pixar. I felt little involvement with the film and its characters, little urgency, and little originality between scenes and found the slapstick humor encompassed way more of the film than it should be entitled to. Then, sometime during the second act it hit me...One must recognize first and foremost that while this will not be a subversive Pixar film like Toy Story, WALL-E, or Cars, but a fairy tale with compromising story devices from Disney and Pixar. Clearly, Disney's influence on the picture's look, story, and characters shines through more than Pixar's, but extracting the morals and the impact of this picture is what really gives us the idea that Pixar had more influence on the crafty, genuine themes and moral setups. To begin with, there is no love story, at all. You think there will be during the competition in the beginning to win Merida's hand in marriage, but it is quickly abandoned for good reasons.Secondly, we are spared the story of a young, directionless teenager who can't find out what to do with her life. The kicker here is we already know what Merida wants to do and she does to; be a more open, free-spirit, riding horseback, equipped with her trusty bow and arrow. While she is self-aware and confident, here problem lies with her mother's resistance to let her pursue such a dream and therefore, she is not roadblocked by indecisive life choices, but indecisive others.And finally, we see a beautiful portrayal of a mother-daughter relationship and how defying tradition is frightening at first, but a compromise between the two parties can be reached in some way. To hear people call the Merida character ""whiny"" and ""selfish"" pains me greatly. Put those people in Merida's shoes, where they are victim to a stubborn, controlling ideology, outdated traditions, and forced to do things that will not better them as a whole, and see what they'd rather do; stay confined or break free from the shackles of convention to be their own person.As stated before, the animation here is just gorgeous, with evocative shots of Scottish landscapes, thrilling scenes of horseback riding, and heavy emphasis on Merida's long, luscious red hair flowing in the wind as she races through the forests of her home. This could possibly be viewed as the least colorful Pixar film, considering it has more of a ""green, gray, and teal"" color scheme, where as every other Pixar film occupies a poster with colors of the rainbow. I, however, see no flaws with the look, style, or feel of this film and the fluency and liveliness between characters and dialog is commendable.Nonetheless, Brave, for now, will be the red-headed (no pun intended) stepchild of the Pixar family, unless in years down the line, when the company has surely made more groundbreakers, audiences and fanboys will look back at this and reminisce their foolish hatred for a film that is deeper and more narratively satisfying than many gave credit for. Can this be viewed as one of the weaker films by the renowned studio? Definitely; it is a bit more reliant on slapstick humor than the many other wonderful pictures, but the more I examine this picture, the more I realize that all of this material may be subversive after all.Voiced by: Kelly Macdonald, Billy Connolly, and Emma Thompson. Directed by: Mark Andrews and Brenda Chapman.",Brave
29,Smells_Like_Cheese,Pixar's good movie,7,8 July 2012,"One movie company I've had faith in these past few years to pull out the great films: Pixar. Wall-E, Up, Toy Story, Monsters, Inc., they've just kept them coming and some of these films are extremely ground breaking. Not just for animation but the story and love that they put behind it. This year they bring us Brave, a tale of a princess who wants to change her fate and follow her own path. Yeah, the Disney story that has been done to death, but this is Pixar, they're bound to do something different with it. So after watching the trailers, I wasn't sure what to make of the film but like I said, it's Pixar, I couldn't skip out on it. One thing I have to warn you is that if you've seen the trailer, this is complete opposite of what you would expect.Princess Merida, a free-spirited and adventurous teenager is informed by her mother that she is to be betrothed to one of her father's allied clans: Dingwall, Macintosh, or MacGuffin. Despite her mother's attempts to explain the necessity of the marriage her by telling her a legend of a power-hungry prince who broke off from his duty and caused the ruin of a kingdom, Merida is dissatisfied with the arranged marriage. The clans arrive with their first-born sons to compete in the Highland Games for Merida's hand, and the princess chooses archery as the main event. Entering the competition, Merida says that as the first-born of Clan DunBroch she is eligible to compete for her own hand, and later has a falling-out with Elinor. When Merida destroys a tapestry depicting her family and Elinor burns her bow, Merida flees to the forest. While there, the ""Will O' The Wisps"" lead her to the hut of an elderly witch who insists she is a wood carver. After some bargaining, the witch agrees to give Merida a spell, in the form of a cake, to change her mother.I won't give away what is the big fate changer, but it is something not incredibly original. Though give where credit is due, as usual the animation is very lovely and they captured the beautiful land of Scotland very well. The characters were just a little too typical, the only one that I really enjoyed was Fergus played by Billy Connolly and I really wished to see more of him in the film, he was funny, charming and seemed like a real father that a lot of kids have. Even Elinor played by Emma Thompson, the mother who is almost dubbed the bad guy for making her daughter go through all the customs of being a princess, but those were the times and how ladies were ""supposed to act"". I wanted to find out more of her character and I think they could've added more sympathy if they explained that she had to go through something similar growing up. The three little brothers are the typical comedic relief and do the job well. As for our main character, Merida, there's nothing too special about her honestly. She seems to be a brat most of the time not giving anything a chance or taking responsibility for anything, a typical teenager. How are we supposed to look up to her if she behaves this way? There are some plot points that are never explained well, like how to reverse the spell that Merida places on her mother. At first the witch says to recite these lines, but Merida never does that and it seems like she doesn't care about her mother's fate. Then there's apparently another way they could reverse the spell all with the power of love. Also the ending seemed to be kind of a cop out and too predictable. However, I would say that the kids for sure are going to enjoy this movie. For the adults, it's nothing special, worth the watch, but just don't expect Pixar greatness.7/10",Brave
30,lasttimeisaw,Tangled Vs. Brave,8,11 December 2012,"Inadvertently I have watched this two Disney animations hand-in-hand (TANGLED is from the orthodox Disney branch while BRAVE is its flagship Pixar production), which seems to be a perfect paradigm to juxtapose them together and to dissect the state-of-the-art tendency of the mainstream genre (enormously profitable since its chief target are zero in on family with children, so it has a much more important and instructive obligation other than merely an entertainment for the toddlers and above). Coincidentally both films' heroines are princess (Rapunzel in TANGLED and a Scottish Merida in BRAVE), adapted from Grimm Brothers' tale, TANGLED is supremely reminiscent of Disney's other established princess analogs trapped in a magic world, let's say Snow White, Sleeping Beauty and Cinderella, what's more, there will always be a prince-charming to deserve and requite her love. Wisely Rapunzel's Flynn Rider has been sizeably modernized as a reckless, self-mocking yet conservatively ""Disney"" prince with a thief background. But in BRAVE, Merida is a much more radical rebel by blood, she doesn't have or need a prince with white horse (the film doesn't care to proffer one since all her tribe suitors are one-of-a-kind wackos), she is fighting against her predestined life path which her mother has arranged for her and her status has requested her, a tad thread-bone notwithstanding, but chronicling with a single-linear arc, the mother-daughter predicament has slipped to the hanging-by-a-thread situation when a magic spell transfigures the Queen's appearance into a bear which cannot be recanted after the second sunrise, therefore, instigates an intimate bonding phase for the two, viscerally the mutual love only exudes when something unusual happens, while living in the mundane life, we are all suffering and grated by the love with a insurmountable generation gap. Rapunzel, on the other hand, her main barrier is the ultimate breakthrough from her ""mother"" Gothel (a greatly overlooked Donna Murphy), who raises her and locks her up in the tower for 18 years, treats her as her own out of a selfish but very understandable motivation (to rejuvenate her youth), but out of any sequential transition, all of a sudden Rapunzel miraculously remember her princess identity (she was taken away when she was an infant, so I doubt there is any memory there, more like an implausible epiphany or actually a screenwriter's block), what's more unbelievably awkward is that she immediately snarls back to her ""mother"" as if all the recollections of Gothel's evil scheme has been replayed in front of her eyes and she has been tortured for all that year long (actually she is fairly happy and content alone with her cutesy chameleon) , which I deem as a child's play, very much panders to its core audience of pre-school demography. So, from a vantage point under the contemporary context, BRAVE is far more daring and enthralling from its ""no guts no glory"" premise, it is able to identify with a way broader audience, which is also the main ingredient of the winsome recipe ""why Pixar can keep excelling all its peers (if not itself) on the top-tier of the hierarchy"", in spite of that on a technical level, all the major animation studios in Hollywood (DREAMWORKS, BLUE SKY STUDIOS, etc.) are almost equally cutting-edge. Music is Disney's strong suit, the first half of TANGLED is a conventional musical showcase, culminating the saccharine romance with the Oscar-nominated theme-song I SEE THE LIGHT, fusing with an intoxicating lanterns-all-over-the-sky spectacle, this has always been the tactic to emit Disney's overblown sentimentality, I am certain it is no longer an all-age proof method now. In BRAVE, although Kelly Macdonald and Emma Thompson's heavy Scottish accents do not get along with my ears, the exotic score and tunes are generally agreeable, and what's more admirable, it doesn't steal the thunder of the film per se. Honestly speaking after the astonishingly-acclaimed WALL-E (2008, 9/10), UP (2009, 9/10) and TOY STORY 3 (2010, 9/10), I automatically skipped last years CAR 2 (2011), BRAVE is a left-field choice, the scale of the story has been slimmed down to a quite unimaginable mother-daughter clash, even grafting it on the most platitudinous soil of a princess's tale. But by good fortune, the film doesn't smear Pixar's paramount reputation, Merida goes through a well-deployed rite-of-passage and the sub-plots such as the blue wisps, the ancient lore of the discontent brother and the witch's hut are all positioned into the right niche to uplift the mythology and idiosyncrasy of the film. As for TANGLED, Disney will never relinquish its tradition (otherwise Walt Disney will definitely be jumping inside his tomb), and it is also an exquisitely-made piece of work, just unfortunately paled by comparison by BRAVE since there is no sparks glittering and all the chirpy happiness seems synthetic and a bit stale.",Brave
31,KineticSeoul,Not bad but not great either for a Pixar movie,6,25 October 2012,"By just the trailer alone it seemed like a predictable movie about a tomboyish princess that wants to do warrior stuff. Like shooting arrows and fighting with swords and will play a key role in defeating a villain that pose a threat to the kingdom...well it goes in a bit of a different direction. More of a family moral message kinda deal but it just didn't seem all that effective or entertaining for that matter. As a CGI animated movie it's alright but for a Pixar movie, maybe it's because of the expectation. But this was kinda disappointing to the point it's sorta forgettable movie and can bore younger audiences and might no appeal to them much. Since the message for this flick seems a bit forced at times, while lacking the sentimental entertainment value. Not much about this movie stands out and it really is a forgettable movie. Not bad, but for a Pixar movie it isn't great either.6/10",Brave
32,OllieSuave-007,Braved enough to watch it.,5,26 June 2015,"The first Disney/Pixar movie to be set in a period time takes us to the journey of Princess Merida of Scotland, who doesn't want to follow tradition and marry a son of a suitor right away, against the wishes of her mother, Queen Elinor. Instead, she wants to follow her own path as an aspiring archer. Merida's personality is like that of a rebellious teenager who doesn't want to listen to her mother and, instead, thinks her own thoughts are what's best, regardless of the consequences - irritating to say the least and sends the wrong message to the youth. Her constant back and forth quarrels in resisting her mother's plea to follow-through with tradition on finding a suitor consumed much of the movie's intro and was boring. However, some excitement kicks in when Merida inadvertently brings a curse upon her family after striking a deal with a witch; thereby, forcing her to set on a mission to make things right.The animation reminded me of a mystical setting which I thought wasn't very colorful, but detailed. I enjoyed the Scottish-flavored music score and the special effects for the film as well. The characters, on the other hand, weren't very memorable for the most part. Much of the adult male characters were clueless, idiotic ruffians, the little triplets were conniving, mischievous thieves and Merida's impetuous and selfish personality went a little overboard. There were a little redeeming qualities in some of them in the second half of the film, though.Overall, it's not one of the better Pixar movies as it's not very magic, unpredictable and awe-inspiring as others.

33,Hellmant,It's nice to see such a strong positive female protagonist in a Pixar film!,7,4 July 2012,"'BRAVE': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five) 'BRAVE' marks many firsts for Pixar; it's the studio's first fairy tale as well as it's first film featuring a female protagonist. Pixar also completely rewrote their animation system in order to give the audience the most state-of-the-art visuals possible and the feature is the first film to use Dolby Atmos sound as well. The movie is a little darker than other Pixar films and tells the tale of a rebellious Scottish princess who accidentally brings a curse upon her family that puts her love for her mother to the ultimate test. The story is a bit like classic fairy tales from yesteryear and not nearly as dumbed down as something like Disney's 'TANGLED'. It doesn't live up to the very best of Pixar or Disney's animated films but it is better than average in my opinion. It's nice to see a slightly more mature and dark fairy tale film from the studios as well.Kelly Macdonald stars as the voice of Princess Merida, daughter of King Fergus (Billy Connolly) and Queen Elinor (Emma Thompson). At a young age Merida was given a bow by her father and has since trained to be an expert archer; to the joy of her father and the distaste of her mother. Her tomboy ways displease the Queen who would very much like her daughter to be a more ladylike Princess and this has caused conflict between the two for many years. When Elinor informs Merida that she's to be betrothed to the firstborn of one of her dad's allied clans Merida runs away and finds a witch (Julie Walters) to grant her one wish. This brings a curse to her family that will truly test the strength and willpower of Merida as well as her love for her mother.The film was written by Mark Andrews, Brenda Chapman, Steve Purcell and Irene Mecchi and directed by Andrews, Chapman and Purcell. It's a little slow in places but for the most part is a well made and entertaining animated film. It looks fantastic and although it wasn't quite as thrilling as it possibly could have been I appreciated that it wasn't packed with simplified childish humor. For the most part I enjoyed the story and by film's end was somewhat touched by the mother/daughter story. It was nice to see such a strong positive female protagonist in a Pixar film for a change and the message was one definitely worth teaching kids. It might be a little too dark and scary (at times) for really young children but for the most part it's a good kids film and another impressive inclusion in Pixar's resume.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDQQKEqGhZQ",Brave
34,thesar-2,Bearly Brave,5,25 December 2012,"Perhaps one of the shallowest, barley forgiving, selfish and hardly living up to the title character: Merida proves that Pixar was too desperate to finally introduce a female lead to its lineup. They should've waited until the right story came along.Brave, thankfully, has a much stronger second half, because the first part's old school Little Mermaid'ish plot was really annoying and thoroughly un-clever. And I'll give it kudos for introducing, or transforming, one character half way through that brightened the story and humor.Part-time archer, and I say part-time because they just had to throw in a completely incidental talent in the mix because, I dunno, bows and arrows are the hot thing these days, Princess Merida refuses to marry because she, sigh, wants to be a free spirit and sling arrows. Occasionally, that is.When given the opportunity, she makes a deal with a witch and inadvertently turns her mom into a bear. Desperately, she attempts to turn momma bear back into human form, and sadly, continues to blame the witch for another 45 minutes or so.(SPOILER ALERT – just this paragraph: When she finally, FINALLY, realizes it was her doing, the ""I'm sorry"" speech is so lame and without heart, I still hated her just as much as before her insincere apology.)I will give grand points to the movie for the absolute beautiful landscaping and design. The movie looked gorgeous, from frame one to the close, it sparkled and amazed me. In addition, the score and songs were decent. Also, some scenes did make me laugh out loud, such as the three little rascal brothers of the Princess helping her escape – having to be bribed, no less, since this movie has little morals – by mimicking a shadow of a bear in the castle's light. Further, the momma bear did provide some comic relief, though she was terribly unoriginal.But, the blah, dated and predictable (even to kids) story really will keep me from ever watching this again. Sad. I wanted to give Pixar another chance after the abysmal Cars 2. And with the upcoming and dreaded Monsters Inc. prequel, I think I'll just patiently wait for the third Kung Fu Panda movie to renew my faith in computer animated films.Side Note: Nudity? Really? I understand these films are also engineered to appease adults as well as kids, but nudity, even the cartoon kind, has no business in these films. Shame.",Brave
35,cherold,Pixar creates a decent Disney Princess,7,6 December 2012,"Apparently Pixar decided they needed a princess of their own, and came up with a feisty Scottish redhead. She's a pretty likable princess, which is good because she's the only significant character in the movie, and her rather predictable emotional journey is meant to keep things in motion.Overall, the movie's copious humor is far less successful than its occasional action. The comedy is very mild, and I rarely laughed out loud, but the sudden appearance of an angry bear and a final urgent forest ride are genuinely exciting. While likable, the movie has to be considered a lesser Pixar film. But it's pleasant enough.",Brave

37,Robert_duder,"Good, fun, and some really great features, but not quite Pixar classic",8,13 November 2012,"You have to feel sorry for Pixar. Considering they've created some of the most amazing animated films in history every eye is on them with everything they release. The review on the main page for Brave says everything I thought right in the title. This reviewer said ""Pixar's latest effort enchants us with stunning visuals, and charismatic characters, but misses the X factor that makes Pixar film's great."" (Joe Chadowski) He just nails exactly how I felt about this entire film. The Animation is stunning as always, the characters are fun and well performed and parts of the film are just simply enchanting which is what we have come to expect from Pixar. But there is something missing. I think that the story for Brave is definitely a little different. It isn't quite the adventure that we are used to from Pixar, most of it taking place in and around the castle in the film. It's a heavily moralistic tale about a mother and daughter. I felt like the beginning dragged just a little bit but then the middle got better and the ending was stupendous and pulls at your heart strings. There is just a certain something missing from the formula that makes this as big as previous Pixar films.The cast is superb. Kelly Macdonald brings a fierce determination and is simply fun as the free spirited Merida. Billy Connolly is brilliant and the role was just tailor made for him as Fergus, her father. Emma Thompson is terrific as Merida's mother before her transformation and the supporting main cast of Robbie Coltrane, Kevin McKidd and Craig Ferguson is just perfectly casted.I would have liked to have gotten a child's opinion on this film. Ultimately Pixar animation is gearing itself towards families and children and I feel like some kids might find this almost boring at times. I never found it boring because it felt more like a film made for adults. It had the ever popular adult humour that parents will laugh and the kids won't understand but I still felt like there was more here for adults than kids. Brave was very entertaining and I wanted to stay with it every minute because the characters were incredibly vibrant and the animation was top notch as it has ever been. The 3D was likely very impressive although I hate 3D. I absolutely recommend Brave because it still first rate animation but don't expect the stone cold classic we have come to expect from Pixar. It's a tow the line entry from them. 8/10",Brave
38,Lejink,Scotch missed,5,29 November 2014,"""Brave"" as in ""Scotland The...""? Just wondering how Pixar justified this latest ""snappy"" one-word title which otherwise tells us little or nothing about the film. While I'm carping about names, as a Scot, I also don't recognise the name ""Merida"" as being authentic, seems to me there are plenty of nice Scottish girl names that could have been used for the new Disney princess at the heart of the feature.Anyway onto the film which for me was a disappointment compared to other Pixar releases. Of course the animation is sumptuous, the detail in some of it is truly wondrous to behold particularly in the depictions of the rugged beauty of the Scottish Highland glens, especially when it's raining or catching the greyness of the cliffs, but the story here lacks magic, at least in the movie-magic sense.I just wasn't taken with the whole bear-transfiguration thing at all and that the film lacked a traditional Disney baddie for the heroine to play up against. And while on the subject of tradition wouldn't it have been more Disney-like if the transformed bad-bear Mordu had changed back to human form at the end to become Merida's Prince Charming? While one or two songs appear intermittently, they, for all their use of pipes and drums, are nonetheless insipid and are easily forgotten.As for the voices, while I commend the use of actual Scottish voices in the main for pretty much all the characters, the use of the over-familiar Billy Connolly as the blustery King seemed wrong to me. There are some humorous touches but the big laughs this time are elusive and the perennial cute-factor characters of Merida's three younger brothers barely registers either.I really had high hopes for ""Brave"" but in the end was somewhat underwhelmed by the film. It just seemed to lack the verve, humour and charm of many of its Pixar predecessors.A ""Brave"" failure in point of fact.",Brave
39,ElMaruecan82,A Bag(pipe) of Contradictions...,6,19 April 2017,"One is never too old for Disney or Pixar; their stories can resonate as strongly in a child than an adult's heart, or are supposed to anyway. The fact is that something definitely changed and I think I can finally figure what. There was a time where Disney movies were addressed to children and to the inner child inside of every adult, now it seems like an opposite trend, the stories are meant to awaken the adult in every child. Children have been gifted the power of imagination, dreams and risk-loving curiosity and these values have always been integral to Disney and Pixar's appeals, but in the 2010's, this (rather sane) philosophy was somewhat turned into an obsession in 'empowering' kids, as potential adults. Especially girls.It can be a sign of modernity if you accept that the usual stories don't elicit the same response they used to, that girls are not interested in princesses or heroines seeking the great love, and that chivalry is not only dead but also decomposed. I would accept it if I was sure it was true. But Pixar has never been into fairy tales anyway; the previous movies always exhilarated positive values like friendship (""Toy Story""), community (""A Bug's Life""), tolerance (""Monsters, Inc."") etc. But it's like ""Brave"" came to a point where the 'millennial' generation became the prime target and some executives decided that these kids needed different role models to shape their personalities.Now, I can see the brainstorming that lead to a film like ""Brave"", certainly full of great intentions, Pixar's first heroine, let's make her a strong, independent female protagonist (what was the Little Mermaid? A 50's shopping housewife?), let's make her a rebellious teen that wouldn't care about marrying a prince. The problem is that whoever came up with the concept of 'Merida' had just answered half the question, if she didn't care about being a princess, what would she care about? By not picking a specific goal, they just made a 'rebel without a cause'. That doesn't quite work with animation whose stories must rely on a particular goal: being a real boy or finding Nemo.And I used the term ""rebel"" because that's the French title that mislead the audience, we all thought it was about a girl who had a personal reason to be a warrior. Actually, Merida just doesn't want to be chaperoned by her mother. The idea is that girls can do whatever they like, they can play boy's games as there are no gender barriers, yet the film can't seem to find the proper conflict to convey that message, something ""Mulan"" did, so they had to come up with the idea of a spell turning the mother into a bear a disastrous move. Indeed, not only does this completely ruin the premise but also since the spell is caused by Merida's rebellion, it implies that her attitude was faulty.There were infinite possibilities with such a starting point, the audience could expect something fresh and original from studios with no history of strong heroines. And on that level, the first twenty minutes were breathtaking and excitingly promising, Merida, voiced by Kelly Mac Donald was starting to grow on me, even the tormented relationship with Queen Elinor (Emma Thompson) reflected a strong personality in the mother-side and I loved the more comprehensive personality of the father Fergus, (Billy Connolly) and the whole family brawl escalated with fun and energy until the tournament between the clans, to choose the future husband, and the twist involving Merida challenging the boys to have her own hand was the moment I believed ""Brave"" deserved its title.And then well, I should have suspected these Will-o'-the-wisp were not put in the opening scene for nothing, but it's like someone else involved in the writing, just tore up the original version and came up with the beastly spell. Did such an exciting coming-of-age story set in the Highlands need to be reliant on magic, à la Disney? Couldn't Merida learn find her own path another way? The film betrays its own message, it's not through archery or bravery that she undoes the spell, it's through sewing and compromising, so much for the feminist message! And the worst thing is that there's a subplot involving another man who turned into a bear because he wanted to follow his path. Speaking of contradictions, ""Brave"" is some head-scratcher.And I feel even more angry because I enjoyed the beginning, the wild personality of Merida and her frizzy curls, her goofy father and bossy mother, even the other clansmen were as fun as they were useless to the plot, but I was ready to follow that fiery energy, instead of these blue magic things, but something failed, which made me understand why they just went full frontally feminist in ""Frozen"" the year after. The film wasn't devoid of contradictions either but that's because movies like ""Little Mermaid"" or ""Beauty and the Beast"" or ""Mulan"" had strong female characters already and were not the result of some marketing so obsessed into making things differently, it makes them awkwardly. Come on, turning the mother into a beast, what were they thinking?""Brave"" was supposed to embrace her heroine's rebellion, yet that's what caused trouble, Merida refused to be forced to marry someone then she conceded she should marry the boy she wants, so it wasn't about marriage anymore. Then she admitted she changed at the end, yet there was nothing that was supposed to change in her attitude, and even if she changed, it was emergency, it's not like she had a choice. Finally, the film was supposed to be groundbreaking yet it relies on so many overused and contrived magical devices it almost reached the ""ex machina"" level.""Brave"" had a great premise, and a terrific start but just too many contradictions to be fully appreciated, and too needlessly long to be enjoyed.",Brave
40,Pjtaylor-96-138044,A different kind of fairytale; progressive and emotional.,6,11 August 2018,"'Brave (2012)' is a different kind of fairytale, one with a progressive princess and a folk-tale feel which both truly set it apart from most others in its genre. It succeeds the most in genuinely feeling like one of the fables talked about within its own narrative: a short and simple story told because it has the power to entertain, enlighten and even emotionally affect, while also having somewhat of a basis in truth. There are several machinations of the plot that don't quite pull together, though, and, in general, the story rushes by so quickly that it's hard to actually believe any of its in-world impact. However, there's actually some real tension in the third act and the climax is surprisingly moving. The central relationship is, for the most part, a believable and nuanced one, too. Finally, the feature makes a point of having strong female characters who aren't reduced to over-the-top caricatures of what some board-room executive imagines a 'badass' woman to be. 6/10",Brave
41,MLDinTN,superior animation,7,19 May 2013,"I thought this was an entertaining animated film. First, the animation is great. Merida's hair is amazing. It looks like you could reach your hand out and touch it. All of it was good.The story was pretty good too. Merida loves archery and riding her horse. Then it is announced she must marry the son of one of her father's allies. She doesn't want to do this, so visits a witch and casts a spell on her mom. What she doesn't know is the spell turns her mom into a bear. Then she must make amends and overturn the curse. Once again the animation of both bears was great. And I thought it had a decent ending.FINAL VERDICT: This had some cute laughs and great visuals. Worth a look if you want an animated film.",Brave
42,g-bodyl,A Pixar Delight!,9,9 January 2014,"The latest film from Pixar, Brave is another winning film to add to the books. Sure, it's not as good as Pixar classics such as the Toy Story trilogy or Wall-E, but it's still a beautifully-animated, well-written story. It's not that original, but it's a good step for Pixar choosing a strong female character as their central character. I liked the Celtic twist to this story because it made the film a bit more surreal and I love anything that has to do with Scotland.Brenda Chapman's film is about a girl named Merida who is the princess of her kingdom. Much to the dismay of her mother, she doesn't want to live the life as a princess. Merida sets out on an adventure to change the ways of her mother, but she unleashes much more than that.This film has a pretty good voice-cast. There's really no stars here, but there are quite a few recognizable names such as Kelly MacDonald, Billy Connolly, Robbie Coltrane, and Emma Thompson. They all do pretty good voicework since they are mostly English, not Scottish.Overall, this is a winning film of Pixar's in my book. Led by impressive visuals, a good story, moral themes, and a strong central female character, this is a delightful films for all ages to enjoy. It may be a little dark or action-packed for little kids though. But, any film that changes one's mother to a bear is a good film I believe. This isn't any Toy Story or Finding Nemo, but then again what is? I rate this film 9/10.",Brave

45,Irishchatter,Good movie!,8,25 December 2015,"This might not be one of my top Disney movies of all time but still, it was quite good yet different! I found it interesting that they targeted the mother to become a bear just because she was getting on Meridas nerves for rushing her into marriage. No other Disney film has ever done that before especially a family member of the main character! I honestly thought the spell was going to make the mother more positive of Meridas choices but definitely an animal was the last thing I ever thought about! I really liked Meridas looks, I say all girls would absolutely die for Meridas big red curly hair! Unfortunately I would have to face consequences in trying to wash and dry the hair. It's different so I hope I see a girl using that style, it would be class!I was disappointed that Disney didn't get Merida a love interest. She is so beautiful like any guy would love her bravery and hyperness! She definitely would show the fellas whose boss lol! Honestly though, she has a good eye for stuff and of course, getting her own way! Even though I said this movie isn't a favourite of mine but, it is really enjoyable if you are an adventure sort!",Brave
46,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews...,6,14 November 2012,"Brave  The hardest part of being brave is finding someone wide enough to stand  in front of you as you go and be valiant.  However, the maiden in this animated-adventure doesn't need a human  shield to be heroic; she has a bow.  Furious over her mother Queen Elinor's (Emma Thompson) choice to marry  her off to an allied clan, Merida (Kelly Macdonald) seeks a witch's  spell to prevent her from doing so.  Unfortunately the hex changes the Queen into a bear.  Worse, the transformation will remain if Merida doesn't make amends  with her mother before sundown.  Meanwhile, her father (Billy Connolly) prepares for battle with his  former friends.  While the animation's striking and the mother/daughter dynamic  commendable, the sorcery subplot is convoluted and detrimental to the  story.  During this recession, however, a mother shouldn't force her daughter  to wed a man of her choosing, but, instead, two men of her choosing.  (Yellow Light)",Brave

Both visually even in 2-D and substance, Brave depicts a mesmerizing eyeful of dazzling and clear animation along with focused mother-daughter relational storyline and surprisingly intense action that offer not one but two climatic scenes. Brave has the intensity and emotional connectivity of The Lion King (1994) and exquisite texture and animated detail as well as the storyline perfectly suited to animation of Bolt (2008).Brave offers a rare mother-daughter storyline in a format and a magical way that is both a treat and creative and bold presentation. Found in other genres such as horror in Dark Water (2005), family drama in Georgia Rules (2007) the relational element of Brave makes this movie a stand out. With good editing, good script that includes plenty of humor and the American penchant for individualism, all of it comes together is an entertaining and captivating summer animated action movie for children (with elements of violence).",Brave
48,ironhorse_iv,Time to brave here and give you my true opinion of the movie. I'll bear it all. Brave was pretty disappointing.,6,5 August 2015,"The animation is beautiful, but it looks like they stole or mirror CGI designs from DreamWorks's 2010's How to Train a Dragon film. It get worst, as the story is mess. Directed by three people, Brenda Chapman, Steve Purcell & Mark Andrews, and set in medieval Scotland. The movie tells the story of Princess Merida (Voiced by Kelly McDonald) whom just come of age. Her over-bearing mother, Queen Elinor (Voiced by Emma Thompson) is so intended is to keep her people alive, that she is willing to marry off, her daughter to the firstborn sons of the clan leaders, in hope for peace. Merida thinks, otherwise, ignored her duties, in hope, of making her own path in life. Soon enough, both women are, in the crosshairs, with each other. Both must learn to sacrifice, some their values, and ideals in hope to grow, a stronger, and meaningful relationship. Can they work out, their issues with each other or will their kingdom suffer, because of it? Watch the movie to find out! Without spoiling the movie, too much, I give credit where credit due, the writers did try to add something new to the Disney princess motifs, with the whole mother & daughter, mend the bond relationship. The problem with it, is the fact, that it's very underdeveloped. Not once, throughout the film, was I convince, that they truly understood each other's problems. The movie rarely gives them, any time to talk it out, and listen to each other, due to all the weak conflicts. I think Queen Elinor turning into a bear, kinda hurts the plot, since she's unable to show, her side of the story. It's very odd for Disney to do this. The usual talking animal trope that often comes with humans-turned-animals is sadly not here. Another problem with the plot is that it felt very recycle. The whole 'magic bear transformation lesson', storyline seem like a rip off, another Disney movie, 2003's Brother Bear. That movie did such a better job, in showing the dangers of selfishness, while understand responsibility when it comes to family and growing up within a community. While, yeah, they're two different movies; I felt like Brave fell flat where Brother Bear didn't. Personally, I think they should have removed these magic bear sub plot lines completely; and focus more, on the conflict of war & marriage. These magic odd legends that doesn't mesh well, with the rest of the film. First off, the curse of Mor'du and Merida situation only vaguely relate to each other, when it comes to theme of selfish in this movie. The curse, overall, deals more about total greed. While Merida is about breaking tradition for individual rights. Vastly different. Near the end, Merida and Eleanor fight this supposed selfishness curse altogether, to show that they're willing to change. Symbolism or not, though, it's still very sloppy writing. Another problem is the Will-o'-the-wisps. They're portray as good spirits, that help the protagonist lead her to her fate. This is far away from the truth folklore, in which they are evil beings that lure victims to their deaths. I don't understand, why Merida would trust these creatures; not once, but three times. They always lead her, to more misfortune. What is the movie, trying to say? That you have to be brave, but willing to let fate, lead you to own demise? I somewhat get the brave part, but who says, that you have to clueless and lead yourself to danger! Maybe, the movie should be, call 'stupid'. Anyways, Merida's problem was never, about how brave, she was. It's all about the issues, when it comes to her freedom of choice. The film is so heavily invest in that theme. So when, it tries hard to introduce, fate into the mix in the opening. Merida's message comes off, as confusing. Fate says that you have no choose, that decisions are meaningless and choices are an illusion. If Merida was so into her fate, why did she bother trying to change it, with the Highland Games and with the witch!? It doesn't seem brave, when you think about it. In many ways, this show how pointless, this movie with its choices. In the end, Merida doesn't really change, anything. While, the film is certainly set in a feministic world, where the women secretly control the state, while the men ruled in public. The agnatic seniority society still lives and she still has to marry somebody. All, she did was postpone her, trouble fate. That isn't brave at all! The whole easy conflict wasn't resolve, when it could had. It comes across as weak. I think the title, The Bear and the Bow is a much more apt title, because of that. When I think of ""Brave"". I'm thinking it was chosen to be subtly reminiscent of Mel Gibson's Scottish Oscar-winning blockbuster smash. No wonder, why the trailers for this film was so confused. Some of the trailers try to play up the ""epic adventure"" while others emphasized Shrek-like slapstick, subversive humor. In reality, both weren't even close. The movie is shallow with its humor and the movie wasn't that epic. The movie is offensive, both to women and men. The voice acting is a mixed bag. Some accents are laughable and rough to hear. The historic anachronism are strong, epic music doesn't felt Scottish, and story fails to deliver a satisfying pay off, when the movie ends. The only highlight is the movie has a lot of Easter eggs cameos from other Pixar's films; that some viewers have started a Pixar film theory, where all the films were connection. Overall: It's a shame this film is such a mess. Best Animated movie of 2012!? I doubt, it, Academy. It's a wasted opportunity of something that could had been great. I absolutely have zero desire to ever visit again.",Brave

53,tomgillespie2002,The clearest sign of Disney's influence affecting Pixar's output,6,23 August 2012,"Since the 1995 release of Toy Story, Pixar was the unbreakable house with its stream of hits catering for both children and adults. Now in its seventeenth year of feature film production, it seems that it is the house of Disney that is most affecting their cinematic output. This years Brave, continues the standard of breathtaking animation, but does not innovate in this field - as was usually expected. Unfortunately, whilst previous hits such as Finding Nemo (2003), Wall-E (2008), and Up (2009), brought inventive new animation tricks, they also brought to the screen some fundamentally beautiful innovations to animated storytelling. Not only did they manage to enthral and delight children, the studio managed to amuse and cater for the parents (and adults without children), in a manner that seemed more, well, adult.Brave tells the traditional fairytale set in the Scottish highlands. A young, red-haired princess, Merida (Kelly MacDonald), is forced by tradition to be married off to a young man from another clan, something that will be determined with an archery contest. Merida, however, does not wish to be married off and argues with her mother, Quenn Elinor (Emma Thompson). Taking off on her steed, she encounters a witch in the woods (voiced by Julie Walters), and she collects a spell in the form of a cake, that will change her mother, so that she will not have to marry. Unfortunately, the cake changes her mother physically, and in the form of a bear, they must break the spell.Whilst not groundbreaking in animation or storytelling, Brave does have heart. The plucky princess wants to break tradition, making it an interesting feminist concept within the context of children's entertainment. It also holds the strong message that age divisions should stop to listen to each others own wishes (here the mother- daughter relationship is strained due to this lack of communication). But unfortunately, the film seems simply to tread themes and story ideas that have been exhaustively explored by Disney's more traditional output, with slight modernisations. And this is the problem I have with this release. Perhaps it is due to the complete merger between Pixar and Disney that the more conventional stories will begin to be their output. I really hope that this is not to be the beginning of the demise of Pixar's genuine genius. But criticism of their latest releases may aid the studio in developing the kind of stories that bring in kids, and entertains the parents/adults also.With some other great voice work though (Billy Connolly, Robbie Coltrane, Kevin McKidd), the film is not a total failure, and will delight children. It does have some genuine laughs, particularly from Merida's younger triplet brothers, whose mischievousness brings some delectable comedy moments. Something other is also happening to cinema, and that is the influence of video games. Whilst Merida is ""on her quest"", she is often helped by willow-the-wisps (small illuminated apparitions), that direct her through forests to get to her destination. The unfortunate thing about this is that none of them sounded like Kenneth Williams - what a missed opportunity. Although, I guess they simply didn't know the reference.

54,filipemanuelneto,The new paradigm of the Disney princesses.,8,18 December 2016,"This animated film is set in medieval Scotland and focuses on the figure of the young Princess Merida. Opposing the idea of ​​marriage by obligation, the young rebel runs away and seeks a way to change her mother's ideas, with severe consequences. Its a film based on the old maxim ""beware of what you want, for it can come true in a way that is not what you had in mind."" Following a recent norm, Disney-Pixar have created an adorable princess who seeks to adapt to the new mentality of modern women. She's not a crying princess who needs to be saved, like Snow White from the 1930s. She is a girl full of personality, with very concrete ideas, she knows what she wants, she just does not know how to do it. And, as has happened in many of the most recent films (Tangled is a good example), it emphasizes the absence of a male hero and the weaknesses of male characters, a fundamental part of its comic essence. We could almost say that it seems that Disney-Pixar came to see men as the weak sex.Mérida is adorable in every way, and its very easy to think of several women in our lives who resemble her, which increases our identification with the character. Her mother is protective and caring, but she can not understand her daughter's wishes. The father, a warrior with passion for bears hunting, is a braggart who adores his children and is almost controlled by his own wife. The animations are excellent, made with great realism and care. The voices are borrowed by a good cast of voice actors, and were thought to try to reproduce the Scottish accent, thus fitting into the mood of the film. The soundtrack and songs do not bring anything new or stay in the ear, but play their role well. Pixar has always been more concerned with the visual aspects than with the songs of its films.In short, Brave is a very good movie and deserves to be seen by the whole family.

57,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"Some will see 'Brave' as a ""lesser"" Pixar film, but it's an undeserving label",8,24 June 2012,"Disney is no stranger to the fairy tale (understatement of the last century), but princesses, curses and kingdoms are definitely new forays for its partner, digital animation powerhouse, Pixar. John Lasseter and company have always been more preoccupied with breathing life into inanimate objects and giving vocal cords to animals, so a film with humans taking place in the Scottish highlands and only lightly sprinkled with magic, is starkly traditional by comparison. For a studio so pristinely viewed by the masses as the cutting edge of animated storytelling to retreat to one of the world's most ancient forms of storytelling might seem a bit confusing and maybe even disappointing, but Pixar does all that it does so well with ""Brave,"" even if the means and the ends are all too familiar.Firstly, Merida (voiced by Kelly Macdonald) would put all the classic Disney Princesses to shame. If they all gathered in the same room, she would stand out with her frizzled red hair and generally antsy disposition, not to mention think them all lame and boring for being dainty and predictable.Although the princess who would rather shoot arrows and run around outside all day than learn how to sit and speak properly is far from an original thought (these days you might consider her a cross between Katniss Everdeen and Arya Stark), Disney desperately needed a heroine who is self-sufficient and strong enough not to need a male co-star and Merida is perfect in that regard. She's not merely rebellious for the sake of the story, but you truly feel as if her character is not fit for a life of royalty.The movie follows a predictable path but a likable one, likable in its familiarity and likable because the issues and themes it speaks to are timeless. The core of the story is Merida's relationship with her mother, Queen Elinor (Emma Thompson). As it comes time for the lords of the three tribes to champion their sons for Merida's hand, the strain in their relationship boils over. Elinor tries maddeningly to make Merida understand her duties as princess, but Merida grows frustrated with her mother's lack of consideration for her own wishes.After an awful fight, Merida flees to the forest and follows the will-o'-the-wisps, desperate to change her fate by changing her mother's mind. After a strange witch presents her with that chance, Merida makes an impetuous choice that has major consequences and challenges her to see just how brave she can be.Merida is also a terrific heroine because she's not perfect. The Queen is not some evil stepmother, so while we understand Merida's feelings, we are frustrated with some of her initial choices. Regardless, you root for her the entire time and she successfully carries the weight of the story on her back.The male characters leave a little something to be desired, though the king, Fergus (Billy Connolly), is a lovable character and father. While he has plenty of foolish moments, he's also responsible and kingly when it's required of him. The lords from the rest of the kingdom are amusing but wild and one-dimensional until the end when Merida convinces them of one of the most obvious notions in human history.Related to the male characters in the film, the level of needless violence in ""Brave"" is surprising, though used for comic effect. Even the old witch, who's in the film for not even 10 minutes, beats her pet crow for no good reason. ""The Incredibles"" aside, Pixar has not traditionally been known for violence, and one could make the case that ""Brave"" is a bit scarier than most family-focused offerings.The humor of ""Brave"" goes beyond physical gags, however, though not into seriously laugh- out-loud territory. ""Brave"" is clever in the way you've come to expect from Pixar, by using truth, heart and goofy supporting characters. The three triplets are the comic highlight of the film to be sure.And heart is where ""Brave"" wins points for Pixar yet again. The commitment to storytelling, even if we're talking basic fairy tale outline with this film in particular, results in plenty of emotional catharsis. Mothers and daughters should particularly be moved by the outcome and moral of this one. Once again, no revelations in terms of the take-home message, but it's such a relief when Merida finally has her epiphany and learns from her actions.""Brave"" receives all the humor, character, heart and visual detail of its Pixar brethren, but much of its achievements will get overlooked. The animation, for example, could be considered among the studio's finest, yet the story and characters are so engaging you forget about it aside from some sweeping landscape shots.Therefore, the bar set by Pixar is the biggest hurdle for ""Brave."" Innovation has always been the studio's norm, but the only real innovation in in the film is a major plot point that the marketing keeps close to the chest. This will lead some viewers to classify ""Brave"" as one of Pixar's ""lesser"" efforts, but wrongly so. ""Brave"" is everything you could want from a fairy tale and then some, but a fairy tale is a fairy tale.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit moviemusereviews.com",Brave
58,Vartiainen,Another fine movie by Pixar,6,16 October 2012,"Pixar's thirteenth movie and the first one with a female protagonist. And naturally there have been loud and prolonged arguments about the pros and cons of this said character, Merida (Kelly Macdonald). Whether she is a much needed breath of fresh air, a female that can stand on her own feet, or whether she's just as clichéd as the rest of the so-called strong independent woman wannabes and a whiny kid unable to accept responsibility to boot.I thought she worked marvelously. She is independent and very headstrong, but she doesn't fall to the usual clichés at all or if she does, she reinvents them and makes them feel unique to her. One of the great things about her is that she doesn't try to rebel against her gender, like so many lesser versions of her archetype. She is a tomboy, sure, but her rebellion is only against the role of her gender in her society. She doesn't wish to be a man in a man's world. She just wants to live her life as she wants, while still being a woman. A very small, but important difference and one that made her feel real.Furthermore, the characters overall are the real strength of this film, as is usual for Pixar. Not every one of them work as intended, though. I, for one, thought that Merida's younger brothers, the triplets, were an unnecessary distraction. They were the constant source of comic relief, and admittedly they made me chuckle a few times, but they were a tad overused. But fortunately the rest of the characters more than made up for them, being memorable, diverse, funny and identifiable. Special mention goes to Merida's dad, King Fergus (Billy Connolly), who's easily the most likable character in the movie and the source of best jokes.The film also looks great. The whole animation system of Pixar was rewritten for the first time in 25 years and it shows. The improvement is not mind-blowing, but it's noticeable. The small details, the smoothness of movement, the landscapes, they all look great and I couldn't have been happier. The score is also very decent and the voice acting is one of the strongest aspects of the film. How can you not love these Scottish accents. Unfortunately I had to see the film in 3D, and it didn't add anything. Complete waste of my money, that.On the downside, the story isn't all that great. It's not bad, really, but it doesn't reach that bar that Pixat has previously set for its films. The plot has some new and interesting things in it, and I liked how the invert some of the usual clichés completely, but then they proceed to play some of the worst ones completely straight, which just makes me seethe in disappointment. And it's not like a film cannot use clichés in order to be good, far from it, but it shouldn't be too predictable, and that's what this movie is. The moment a new plot point was introduced, I could tell how it'd play out. And I was correct most of the time. The ending had a nice twist, but that's about it.Story-wise this movie felt more like a Disney production, and not in a good way. It had song sequences, it had fairy tale elements, it had the children against parents kind of thing going on, it had a moral lesson to be learned... It just didn't feel like Pixar.That being said, it's still a good film. It's not great, like so many other Pixar films, but that doesn't prevent it from being very, very good. It has great humour, it has great characters, it has great animation, it's just the story that's a bit subpar.",Brave
59,Vartiainen,"It's fine, but also very by the numbers",6,22 October 2019,"There have been quite a many Disney films in the 21st century that feel very much like Pixar films. It goes to follow that there would be a Pixar film that feels like a Disney film. This is that movie.Brave is the tale of Merida, a Scottish princess, who ironically tries to avoid that one fate for which many other Disney princesses have almost literally sold their souls: marriage. So she finds a wood witch and gets herself a cursed piece of of bakery, which she promptly offers to her mother, the main architect of the looming betrothal. But, once again our plucky heroine refused to read the fine print and the results of the spells are not quite what she was looking for. Are they ever?Brave is certainly a pretty film. Sure, some of the backgrounds and certain scenes show their age a little bit, but there are also scenes, especially in the forest, that still look very impressive. There's also Merida's hair, which is just silly in its complexity.Unfortunately I'm not a big fan of the story. It's very derivative of earlier Disney efforts, very predictable and doesn't stray far from the usual clichés and tropes. There's also the fact that it's not internally consistent. For example, there's a very good scene between Merida and her mother around the end of the second act. The only problem being that the curse should have been broken right there and then. It of course doesn't, because we still have the whole third act to go through, but it should have. And it does, at the end of the film, when we have almost the exact same scene all over again. Only this time it works, for plot reasons.Still, it's still a Pixar film. Meaning that even though it's not their best film by any means, it still has heaps of content, quality and charm. It'd not be my first pick if I wanted to watch a Pixar film, but if it's on TV, I'll watch it every time.",Brave
60,lisafordeay,A good film but not as good as the brilliant Tangled,6,1 May 2013,"Saw this in the cinemas in 3D last year on my own and I quite enjoyed it. The story has been done to death but the film is about a girl called Merida voiced by Kelly McDonald who never gets on well with her mother Eleanor voiced by Emma Thompson from Nanny Mcphee who always tells her to behave like a princess and marry. But Merida doesn't want to find a man and she and her mother fall out. Merida then stumbles across the wisps of faith and she meets a witch voiced by Julie Waters who gives Merida a spell that could change her mother's mind. But the spell backfires as she is transformed into a bear and only has 2 days to stop it before its too late.The animation was groundbreaking and the scenery of Scotland was gorgeous but I dunno it was missing something. Maybe its because Pixar was trying to make it look like a Disney flick even though it should cause Wreck It Ralph was a real Pixar movie,Brave wasn't. Then again maybe I prefer love stories like Tangled which is my all time favourite movie. The voice acting in Brave was brilliant but the plot and the story was a bit of a knock off of Brother Bear meets Freaky Friday sorta. But for what its worth,you should definitely check it out.",Brave

But because of her controlling mother the queen(Emma Thompson), she arranged to be somebodies queen, but Medira wants to break that tradition, with little help from her bumbling father the king(Billy Connelly), will Medira ever find her independence? There is a lot more of the plot that I do not want to giveaway, because I want you to see it. The animation is spot on in details, like the setting, and the characters. Awesome voice acting, by Kelly Macdonald, Emma Thompsan, and Billy Connelly, who mostly provides the laughs, along with the animated three triplet boys. It's for kids over 12 years old.",Brave
62,freemantle_uk,A delightful family film,9,23 February 2013,"Pixar is known for being one of the best studios around and certainly the best animation studio, making many films that are critical and commercial hits. But Pixar's stellar record took a big blow with the release of Cars 2, Pixar's first critical flop and commercially one of Pixar's weakest films. They needed strong follow-up and whilst its rating is not as strong as high as other Pixar Brave is still a very delightful family film.In a medieval Scottish kingdom Merida (Kelly Macdonald) is a rebellious teenage princess who is skilled at archery and wants to decide her own fate. But her mother, the regal and diplomatic Queen Elinor (Emma Thompson) who wants her to act as a princess and teaches her everyday how to act. When she humiliates her mother during a ceremony Merida runs off into the woods and meets a witch (Julie Walters) who promises she can change Merida's destiny with a spell. But of course when there are witches and magic around things go array and Merida ends up with more then she bargained for.The animation is stunning to look at. The designs of the people, scenery and buildings were fantastic, being very colourful and detailed: it is so noticeable when you look at Merida's ginger hair. The directors are able to get to sink the audience into a wonderful medieval world and there are great camera movements that make the action flow wonderfully.Brave had a troubled production: it was originally going to be the first Pixar film to be directed by a woman, Brenda Chapman before being replaced by Mark Andrews. The film was originally intended to be a Brother Grimm's style fairy that was called The Bear and the Bow and was set to star Reese Witherspoon. What we got was a typical Disney Princess story of a young girl who wants to defy the conventions of her society and gets mixed up in a magical plot. There are certainly elements of films like The Little Mermaid and Aladdin as well as homages to Pinocchio and Robin, but the production was able to twist these elements. There is no wicked stepmother character trying to seize the throne or be evil and the witch is more misguided then evil. The basic themes of the mother-daughter, the misunderstanding between the two as Queen Elinor wants to do the best for her daughter and her kingdom. The other theme is the characters that have to uphold they role of duty and ceremony whilst wanting freedom to control their lives. It is a balancing act the characters have to learn to understand other and how they roles in society.A great voice cast was assembled for the film, Macdonald, Thompson, Billy Connery being the main three and many excellent actors like Kevin McKidd and Robbie Coltrane in minor roles. For an actress in her 30s was brilliant as teenage character, giving a real performance as she showed the range of emotions and actions the character goes through. Macdonald was a better casting choice then Witherspoon because she would have been too big of a name for the film.Brave does supply on the comedy stakes, giving us plenty of physical comedy and verbal jokes. It is really funny seeing a bear trying to be regal. It is funny film but Pixar's strength is also delivering a heart story with subtle, real emotion and some fine action sequences. The film does follow the Hero with a Thousand Face formula as both Merida and Elinor learn from their journey.The first 30 minutes and the final act are excellent pieces of cinema, with great drama and comedy, plenty of action and focused on its themes of family relationships and female empowerment. But the middle was when there was a little dip in quality. The second act is still good and better then most films, but it felt like a different film: particular the crooky witch. The witch even leaves an answering message that felt like it belonged more to a Shrek film then a Pixar or Disney film. The humour from the witch did not seem to match the rest of the film.Brave is a great family film. Pixar has made better film in the past but it is still an excellent watch shows that Pixar do put a lot of effort in their films. Boys, girls and adults will enjoy the film. It is easily the best Scottish set medieval film. Please note I really hate Braveheart!",Brave
63,dfranzen70,Solid fare in the old-school Disney tradition,7,10 July 2012,"Brave, Pixar's new animated film, doesn't quite match its predecessors for whimsy, emotion, and awesomeness, but it's a pretty fine movie nonetheless. It has its scary parts, like most Disney movies, but the five year old who saw the movie with me wasn't scared one bit, so you probably won't be, either. But I don't know, she's kind of tough. Merida (voice of Kelly Macdonald) is the first-born princess in a mythical Scotland kingdom. Unlike most princesses, though, Merida is feisty, passionate, and more willing to shoot a bow and arrow than to be a demure little lady. Sort of the opposite of what her strict mother, Queen Elinor (voice of Emma Thompson) desires. The feud between headstrong mother and child comes to a head when the former announces there will be a huge party attended by the three other major clans, the head of each bringing along his first-born son to offer to Merida as a husband. It's tradition, of course. That tradition gets upended by Merida's unyielding will, and in her desperate defiance of her mother she encounters a witch (Julie Walters) who grants her a spell that will change Merida's destiny. Not an uncommon theme in these movies; the trouble is that the characters never seem to understand that changing a destiny doesn't mean it's changed for the better. In this case, Merida's destiny - not a spoiler here - is changed in that her mother becomes a bear. Hilarity ensues.All curses in movies, particularly in animated movies, have some kind of loophole. Here, it's that if Merida can repair a certain bond before two sunrises, she can reverse the spell; otherwise, dear old mum will be a bear forever. For a queen who hardly ever ventures outside her enormous castle, this is quite the fish-out-of-water dilemma.From an animation standpoint, Brave is elegant without being too flashy. It doesn't try to be overly realistic, with a tremendous attention to detail, like the earlier Pixar films had. Truth be told, the movie has much more of an old-time, traditionally animated Disney film than a new- wave Pixar movie. The movie is presented in 3D and in 2D, and I recommend the latter - if only because there are many dark scenes (in a forest, mostly) that will be rendered indiscernible in 3D, which vacuums light up. Some of the forest scenes are very pretty indeed, specifically those involving the appearance of the will o' the wisp, a spirit that helps Merida find that which she seeks. The movie is not without its fair share of humor, even slapstick. Merida's father, the King (voice of Billy Connolly) is a rough-and- tumble, huge, no-necked man who's just as soon drink a gallon of ale with you than break your nose. He's also missing a leg, the tale of which he never tires of telling, to the chagrin of his family. Merida also has three little brothers who, being boys, get away with anything they wish, while the poor princess must conform to strict rules of order. Ain't no fun being a princess, apparently.Brave is a modest movie by Pixar standards, but its plot is a little more enriched than those of its predecessors, with myths, legends, and oral traditions leading the way to, in some cases, more questions. Well, more questions if you're eight years old and want to know more about everyone's intentions. If you are eight years old and are reading this, congratulations - our schools has made you a learny person. In any event, the plot is simple on the surface but contains deeper layers of provocative intrigue, never a bad thing. Kids will either gloss over the details or will find them fascinating.",Brave
64,runamokprods,"OK, so I'm a Pixar junkie.",9,27 November 2012,"I'll admit 'Brave' doesn't have quite the wall to wall boldness, rule-breaking and sheer brilliance of the very best of Pixar's work, but I'll still take it over 95% of the Hollywood films I've seen this year. It never bored me, it made me smile a lot, laugh a little, and was a more touching look at the complexity of mother and daughter relationships than most grown-up films that try to deal with the subject. It also has a heroine who is a spunky, tough and first rate advocate for girl power, while still being heart-meltingly vulnerable at just the right moments. And it has tremendously talented voice actors in Billy Connolly, Kelly Maccdonald, and especially Emma Thompson. Most important, it has a twist half-way through that takes it in a delightfully unexpected direction. I will admit, for the first half I was a bit under-whelmed, The film seemed more Disney than Pixar, with 'safe' humor and ideas. Just a touch disappointingly predictable. But then a witch gets involved in this medieval Scottish tale, and with a twist that's more Shakespearian comedy than Disney, suddenly this is a new film we haven't seen before. The second half easily won me back over, and I was left feeling, as I always seemed to be, that working for Pixar must be about the greatest job in movies.",Brave
65,drqshadow-reviews,"A Fine Fable, Its Limited Scale Left Me Wishing for More",7,21 November 2012,"A warm, cozy fairy tale that feels more like a Disney production than the latest entry in Pixar's storybook. It's sweet, quirky and funny, but routinely falls back on familiar motifs and often seems criminally under-explored. Since the vast majority of the action takes place in and around a single locale, there's a claustrophobic quality in the air that never truly dissipates, which robs us of the grand scale that's been present in every one of the animation factory's preceding works. It's no more than a straightforward telling of a reasonably interesting fable, with only a few short jolts of the unique character and timely laughs I've come to expect from the troupe. Of course, there's no arguing the fact that Pixar knows how to produce gorgeous scenery, and Brave is yet another leap forward in that regard; the surrounding landscapes are unanimously breathtaking, and Princess Merida's hair is constantly bouncy and lifelike, truly a character unto itself. It's an enjoyable fresh ride and a marked improvement over the lifeless Cars 2, but misses the depth and flair that made me fall so deeply in love with the studio's classics.",Brave
66,GiraffeDoor,Aesthetically pleasing but derivative adventure,6,17 April 2019,"You may remember how the trailer to this gave you very little idea of what the plot was about.Well she accidently has her mother turned into a bear. That's what happens. I was watching this think ""wait...haven't they done this idea before? Emporer's new grove did a similar thing but with a Llama, The Princess and the Frog did this but with frogs and Brother did this but with...the exact same animal"". I know Pixar IS NOT Disney. At least not in essence.I'm not saying that each of these 4 movies don't have their own nuances, styles and ideas to explore, only it seems a bit of a tired idea by this point.The first act has an ostentatiously feminist verve, like it's desperate to be this decade's Mulan. But we don't need another Mulan because we have Mulan. Is it saying something else pertinent about feminism? Not really. We have a heroine, the kind that idents love to call ""plucky"" or Feisty"", who filches apples, who pouts in an unladylike way and then uses her bow and arrow like a boss.The first act seems pretty engaging as she dares to compete with her own suitors ""for her own hand"".But this movie that was so happy to wave the flag of girl power thought it was good idea to turn the whole thing into one of the most effeminate road trip movies you can imagine. I don't care that one is a bear. Is it really feminist to make this just some female analogue to a Goofy Movie? Or to adnadone the badassdom to just have a story of female bonding? (I suppose they're the same thing as much as I love A goofy Movie).I'm not saying there aren't stuff to like: these kinds of movies always have a lot of visual wit and talent that draw you into the world they've created with its details, textures, rich characterisation, inoffensive but wonderful humor and general sense of wonder. The radiant aesthetic of the Celtic autumn, its sound track full of local color and pop ballads (that you will hate to love but love all the same) plus the scope of its set pieces make sure that seeing this is not a waste. It's just that it's main plot got a bit misguided.What made Mulan so wonderful is that Mulan wasn't sure which world she belonged to more and was on just as much of a learning curve as the men in becoming a soldier. Of course I need to stop thinking this is trying to be Mulan because it's clearly so different but, as anyone who has a seen a Miyakzaki movie will tell you, taping on some progressive colors does not mean you have instantly charmed every progressive in the room.One of the lesser efforts of its studio but it's still not half bad.",Brave
67,CubsandCulture,Pixar's most conventional film,8,4 January 2021,"This is one of the very few Pixar films where its influences are utterly obvious. There's a dash of Brother Bear, there's clear art direction influences from the Secret of Kells, other Celtic works (i.e. Rohan in LOTR) and any number of Disney's princess films form the backbone of the film in terms of narrative and visuals. Indeed, Medira is such a Disney princess that she gets her own gag in Ralph Breaks the Internet. The central mother-daughter story is engaging and there's a lot of gorgeous vistas in the film but it all has been done before and usually better. The only idea that struck me as sort of new were the gags involving how the Queen tried to act human when in bear form.",Brave
68,estebangonzalez10,"Brave is among Pixar's least best work, but it still is enjoyable",6,11 January 2013,"¨If you had a chance to change your fate, would you?¨Pixar has raised the bar so high in animated films that it seems unfair to go into a film with such high expectations, but I did with this movie. Brave isn't a bad film, but it really doesn't hold up to Pixar's greatest pictures like Up, Toy Story, Finding Nemo, or Ratatouille. It is visually amazing, but in an animated film I have come to expect a good story with interesting characters as well, along with a decent amount of comedy. Brave sometimes feels a bit serious, with not much really happening story wise. It is a gorgeous film to look at, but I 'm afraid the characters won't stick with me in the same way that other animated characters have done so. I don't know how much younger children will enjoy this movie, but it is a film that grown up kids and adults might enjoy. Brave is entertaining, and I have to admit that Pixar finally gave us a different kind of Disney princess this time. Merida loves archery and adventures; she isn't your typical princess that dreams of finding love or is patiently waiting for her prince to come rescue you. This was probably my favorite aspect of the film; having Pixar introduce us to a different kind of heroine: a brave one. On the negative side I find it pretty tiring that they continue to insist on this parent against kid confrontation, where you have one of the parents trying to impose their value on the kid, and the parents always end up looking like the bad guys. There were a lot of similarities between this movie and How to Train Your Dragon (a movie I really loved), although that movie was more gorgeous to look at and had much more memorable characters. Brave is a good film, it just isn't as great as the latest Pixar releases.Brave takes place in Scotland in a mythical time where four different clans all live in peace among each other. Fergus (Billy Connolly) is the leader of his clan, and he rules his people bravely alongside his wife, Queen Elinor (Emma Thompson). They have a daughter named Merida (Kelly Macdonald) who Elinor is preparing to be Queen one day. She must behave and act like a princess despite the fact that Merida prefers riding on her horse all day and having outdoor adventures with her bow. This difference between Merida and Elinor is what continually puts them against each other. When Merida finds out that her mother intends her to marry one of the firstborns of the other three clans she gets even more upset with her. Tradition stated that she must marry the firstborn of one of the clans in order to maintain the peace in the region so all three clans are coming to their land to fight for her love. One night Merida is so outraged that her mother never listens to her that she decides to run away from her home and comes across a witch who gives her a potion to change her mother. This way Merida believes she will finally be able to make her own decisions and her mother will accept her. What she doesn't know is that her actions will have terrible consequences and that peace among the clans will be at stake.The funniest characters in the film are the three younger brothers Merida has who are constantly being reckless. They provide the few comedic moments this animated film has. Otherwise I felt it played out more as a drama/adventure than a comedy. I really just got across watching this film after it received its Oscar nomination for Best Animated Feature Film and was a little disappointed with it, but perhaps I'm just getting too old for this stuff. I still have to see the other four nominees before I choose my favorite, but Wreck it Ralph looks interesting. The plot really got weird during the second half of the film, but I still enjoyed the movie overall although I won't be watching it again. I was a little disappointed with the story, but the visuals of the Scottish highlands were great. The film was directed by Mark Andrews after Brenda Chapman abandoned the project during the production stages. Andrews is mostly known for his short animated film: One Man Band which I loved. He didn't have that great of a story to work with, but Brave is still a slightly entertaining film just don't go into it with such high expectations.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",Brave

The premise itself isn't anything breathtakingly new, but is most certainly enjoyable to see unfold.The cast are excellent, with my personal standouts being Kelly Macdonald (Merida) and Emma Thompson (Elinor).

70,3xHCCH,Derivative Artwork and Naughty Heroine,6,6 August 2012,"""Brave"" is the story of another feisty Disney princess, given the PIXAR treatment. Her name is Merida, a Scottish princess. She is a headstrong tomboyish teenage who cannot accept the tradition espoused by her strict mother that she is to be betrothed for marriage. Therefore she resorts to witchcraft to change her fate. She really got more than what she bargained for, a shocking development of ursine proportions. She later learns that she has only a couple of days to reverse the terrible spell. Could she?""Brave"" is just okay for me overall. It is still better than the last Pixar movie, ""Cars 2."" While on the surface everything looks good and glossy, especially the archery scenes, there are several things that I did NOT like about ""Brave."" Art-wise, while Merida and her fiery red hair looked great, the caricature-ish look of the Scotsmen were drawn so much like the Vikings in Dreamworks' ""How to Train Your Dragon."" The brutish barbaric culture they exhibited likewise shows very little difference from that in ""How to Train"", aside from the kilts the characters wore in this movie and their Scottish accents.Screenplay-wise, ""Brave"" goes a little darker and violent, and thus may be too scary or disturbing for young kids. More than that, I did not like how Merida did not immediately take responsibility for the horrible effects of the witch's spell. While many of the other Disney princesses also disobey their parents and get into trouble, those princesses themselves directly suffered the consequences of their disobedience. Here, Merida's insolence put another person in peril. Merida actually did something akin to what the Wicked Witch did in Snow White! Frankly, it is this particularly negative aspect of the story that badly affected my appreciation of this movie as a whole.",Brave

73,aharmas,Beary Beary Good...,10,7 July 2012,"Pixar rebounds from last year's weak entry with a vivacious, delightful, and exquisitely rendered tale of growing up and independence. Merida's adventures detail her period of adjustment to what society expects from her, and how this might be in direct opposition to what she dreams of becoming. In between we have her mother, the queen, a strong presence who has for years tried to keep things in order in her kingdom. With her jolly husband and her four children, things are a bit challenging.It is time to join the various kingdom with a prearranged marriage, and the day of the tournament, things don't quite go as expected. Soon, Merida has struck a deal with a legendary member of the forest, and things go from bad to worse. This being Pixar, it all happens in a very entertaining way, making the story move fast, with plenty of visual gags, and enough emotions to pull a tear or two from the audience.Merida begins to appreciate what she is about to lose, and she must race against the clock, as a spell will become permanent in two sunsets, unless she is able to realize a way to fix her mother's condition.The film is at best enchanting, as we travel through the Scottish lands and listen to the various clans interact with each other. The film retains a magical aura throughout, even in the most intimate scenes, and how far we have gone with CGI that now it seems to blend or recreate nature in a more convincing way. Kelly McDonald and Emma Thompson give royal performances as Merida and her mother, and it is my pleasure to note that know every single pair of eyes, particularly the mother bear have an incredible real and affecting look.This is a film that will bewitch its audience and extend Pixar's standards to new highs. A classic.",Brave
74,aidanratesmovies,Tied with Cars 2 for me as my least favorite Pixar film,5,11 April 2020,"Beautifully animated, but incredibly tedious, Brave strives to be a valuable animated film, but instead ends up losing to mediocrity in the battle against its own potentially interesting concepts. The film is quite dull at times, scavenging through many interesting ideas, but never developing them to the heights they could have, and instead, the film becomes increasingly predictable throughout its course. The story has been done before, in many ways, and the humor at times can vary from amusing, to overly-goofy. The pacing starts quite well, but about the time the climax of the film hits, it seems to go downhill from there. Brave does contain some sweet moments, but seems to try too hard to feel important in an overcrowded field of animated films and companies producing them. In the end, Brave can be funny and sweet at times, but doesn't make use of its potential in the way it could have. It can be incredibly tedious, and painfully dull, but all together, not a total drag.

75,questl-18592,Brave,7,10 November 2019,"This movie has really grown on me. On first watch it was middling, just ok. Having just watched it again, the story finally clicked for me. As one would expect from a Pixar film, it's gorgeous, the voice acting is spot on. The story of female empowerment and mother/daughter reconciliation is quite powerful. There's a bit of hand waving and the only real ""twist"" comes pretty early and after that the movie is incredibly predictable but otherwise it's still very enjoyable.",Brave
76,ShelbyTMItchell,Cute movie!,7,2 November 2012,"It was a cute movie. Not the best. It is like watching Hunger Games Katniss Everdeen centuries earlier. As the main protagonist wishes that she was not royalty or wished that she did not have to marry at such a young age her mother did.She wants to be independent and free. And as her parents along with her three twin brothers try to have a bunch of men winning her hand. As she is punished for taking up archery among them.She later gets ""help"" from a witch. After she disappeared into the forest without her parents knowledge again. To get rid of the problem. As the problem turns out to be her mom. As you have to watch what she gives her mom.That her mom turns into a bear. Along with her three younger twin brothers. Now she and her mom as a bear. Must find the solution to turning them back and also, bonding as a mother and daughter for real. Which they seem to not have been all along or for a long time.Cute story and movie.

77,TheOneThatYouWanted,Could have been better if..,6,13 September 2020,If... they didn't do that..magic..thing. I am not going to spoil this movie for you but it was pretty good until a magic spell happened that changed the whole plot of the film. I wasn't put off by the bait and switch element of the movie but it down graded the film's story and everything that follows. It is like going out to eat and being told you're going to get a steak dinner but you're served a hotdog. You like hotdogs but you came to the restaurant to have steak. That is what happens here. The film downgrades its story and doesn't bounce back.,Brave
78,jadepietro,Bravehair,7,25 June 2012,"This film is recommended.The title for the new Pixar / Disney collaboration, Brave, seems a bit of a contradiction of terms. Unlike other ground-breaking animated features like Ratatouille, Up, Wall-e, Finding Nemo, or its Toy Story trilogy, where artistry and story perfectly mesh, this offering plays it all too safe in its narrative while still awing the movie-going audience with breathtaking CGI effects. ( This film is more of a minor achievement, in line with Monsters, Inc. and Cars. ) Perhaps, the once edgy and creative Pixar is becoming more conventional and too much concerned with the Disney marketing machine. Hopefully that is not the case.The story is rather predictable and its message too preachy. An independently-minded princess ( sure to be in toy stores from the holidays ) named Merida wants nothing to do with marriage or hand-picked suitors to wed. Merida would rather climb mountains, ride horseback and shot arrows. It's girl power all the way! Her mother, Queen Elinor, would rather that her daughter be more ladylike and refined and follow the traditions of the past. This leads the princess to take matters into her own hands.The film's strengths are in the visual detailing. Pixar is known for its glorious textures and stunning settings, and in Brave, that continues to be its forte. ( The renderings of animal fur done in a photo-realistic style, the transparent liquidity of water and rain, the panoramic vistas of forests, fields, and streams, all these elements help to enhance this tale. Particularly impressive is the facile expressions and movement of the bears in this film and the stylish exaggeration of the film's secondary characters. ( Not so impressive: A major misstep are the characters of the Queen which lack any real dimension and our heroine, Merida, who becomes a living Kewpie doll creation, far too cute and rather bland in the mix. ) Voiceovers by Kelly Macdonald, Emma Thompson, Billy Connolly, and Julie Walters truly capture the Scottish lilt and add the right tone and rhythms to the dialog. However, the slim story never takes hold. It downplays the more serious dramatic issues and emphasizes the comedy. There is no good vs. evil side, no real villain to hiss at. ( One is introduced midway, but its seems an afterthought and doesn't build any tension at all. ) Everyone around the two strong-willed but essentially dull central characters of mother and daughter is portrayed as a clownish buffoon or an oafish lout. In fact, all of the male species in Brave serve as comic fodder while the women are seen to be far superior in intellect and manner. At times, I personally found this conflict to be chauvinistic to the male gender as the film exults the female liberation aspects in such a heavy-handed and biased way.Yet there are certain scenes in the film that are such wonderful examples of state-of-the- art animation and this artistry elevates the film to a higher level of worth. ( The archery contest, the fishing scene, and the climactic hunt come to mind. ) But the sum of the film's individual parts outweigh the overall effect. Brave might have been given the royal treatment by all of the artisans involved with this venture, but its pure-bred pedigree falls short of its Pixar predecessors. Let's hope their next project will center on a more demanding and compelling script and return this studio to its glory days of Ole.

81,RainDogJr,Just what you expect from Pixar: fun and soulful material,10,22 July 2012,"I'm pretty sure you have seen already the first teaser trailer for Pixar's 2013 project MONSTERS UNIVERSITY. Pixar knows everyone will get to see many times stuff about their movies long before the actual release; I'm not sure how many times I got to see the BRAVE trailer but it even was present in the DVD of CARS 2. So thanks to the trailers and the many newspaper articles I got to see I thought I knew what BRAVE was all about. And the thing is Mark Andrews, Brenda Chapman and Steve Purcell (all doing their very first Pixar feature film) gave me just what I expected: the hugely enjoyable -and visually fantastic- tale of a not very common princess, whose interests go way beyond the traditions of the kingdom (she basically needs to become a -lovely- *princess* and getting an arranged marriage is a big step for that). But actually that ""I got what I expected"" thing goes only for the first part of the film. I really appreciate and love when a film totally surprises me (in a good way, certainly), and BRAVE did exactly that since Pixar didn't give almost anything away with the trailers. What we have is a movement that makes the film more marvelous and that, I dare to say, will alone turn some people off. But it's pure comedy gold - humor based on the classic behavior of a mother. The core of the film's themes is parenting, and you can relate to a lot of things. For instance the stuff with the father (the king, who is one of those that will ""fight a bear with bare hands"" – I recalled the men from HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON thanks to the king and his pals) being totally rude and everything with his friends until his wife says *no more*! Who can't relate with that? BRAVE is exactly what you expect from Pixar: fun, soulful material, with memorable characters (like the hilarious almost-ignored-by-everybody redheaded triplets!). Go see it on the big screen! *Watched it on 20 July, 2012",Brave
82,p-stepien,Pixar's version of a 'bad movie',6,11 January 2013,"Set in the mythical past of Scottish highlands comes a tale of bravery and the limits of family love. Fire-haired Princess Merida (Kelly Macdonald) is destined by tradition to become a promised wife. Nurtured and educated by her mother Elinor (Emma Thompson) she must always stay distinguished, even as her three young brothers let all hell loose on a daily basis. Her father, King Fergus (Billy Connolly) is more lenient, but also more interested in hunting down Mor'du, the great demon bear, than truly standing up for his daughter's independent spirit. Only once a year is Merida allowed to let loose - during her birthday. One year during such an escapade Merida comes across a witch (Julie Walters), who is attempting to enter a new career path as a wood carver. Nonetheless Merida convinces her to cast one last spell, which will allow her freedom to make her own decisions in life. As every such fairy tale spell the wish has dire repercussions...When Pixar makes a 'bad movie' it is still probably the best animated feature of the year. Naturally animation is perfected year after year, but this time around the story department falters delivering what seems like a substandard fairy tale. Characters are generally very affable, but somewhere along the rushed exposition the movie falls to real lift off when the end credits appear. Despite a few hilarious chuckles, especially centred around creative uses of Scottish kilts, the overall quality on every level is a few steps below what has become expected from the famed stable of animatrix, not to mention the uncomfortable mimicry of the ""My Brother Bear"" movie. It's a shame that the daughter-mother plot didn't receive a much better impact treatment, given the general characters populating the movie are actually pretty good base material for building a great story.",Brave
83,rannynm,Love Love Love it. Simply Phenomenal,10,3 August 2012,"KIDS FIRST! Film Critic, Raven Devanney (age 15) shares her review below: video review here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNlM5zTqGHABrave is the all new Disney and Pixar animated film about a young princess who breaks tradition. Determined to change her fate, princess Merida attempts to use a spell to change her mother's opinions on marriage. But, as she soon learns, not everything is as it seems when it comes to magic. Brave is a visual masterpiece. It is honestly the best Disney Pixar film I have ever seen and it took my breath away. Which such beautiful imagery and an unsuspected storyline, I believe that Brave will go down in history as one of the best animations ever. I laughed and cried throughout the whole film, it even moved my parents to tears. The heavier emotions are so wonderfully crafted and the comedy is hilarious and very timely, it makes for a great emotional medley. My favorite character is princess Merida because she is so strong and determined even when she is faced with challenges and I believe that she is a character that every young person can look up tp. She is also determined to right her wrongs and fix her mistakes and that is something everyone should aspire to do. My favorite part of the film is watching the bear queen try to figure out how to get by in the wilderness because her facial expressions are still very human and hilarious. She was continuing to act like she was in a castle even though she was in the middle of the woods and it makes for a very comical situation. The end of the film is the best part for me. It blew me away and topped my every expectation for a movie ending, but you'll just have to see what happens for yourself. There is definitely some scary and intense parts in this film and younger kids may get frightened but I recommend this film for all ages because it's a must see for everyone. On a scale of 1-5 I give Brave 20 stars because it is so phenomenal so grab your family and friends.",Brave
84,mike48128,"Disappointing follow-up to ""Tangled""? The Plot is UnBEARable",7,7 December 2012,"""Tangled"" was so good we couldn't wait to see what Pixar would do next. Plot is important. All the elements are there: The rebellious princess. The wise mother. Magic and witches. But somehow it doesn't quite add up. The ""animation"" seems stiffer than in ""Tangled"". It's just not as funny. Angus the horse has more personality and brains than most of the humans in this story. The women seem better ""drawn"" than the men; who appear sub-human and doltish. The scenery and backgrounds are breathtaking, but this doesn't make up for the plot twist of turning humans into bears. It seems to be a bit ""off"" even for Pixar. The best ""characters"" with the best humor are the witch and her talking crow. The ending doesn't work. I doubt if the little girls in the audience even know what ""marrying for love"" means. It's a bit too adult for such a frivolous film and doesn't quite fit.I bet most people didn't see the ""surprise"" after the credits (which are 7 minutes long). The crow delivers the enchanted woodcarvings to the castle! Not as bad as other computer-rendered ""sequels"" of late, but it doesn't meet the test of ownership: I did not feel compelled to see it again or add it to my video collection. A good rental as long as your kids won't mind seeing the ""villainous"" enchanted bear (not the ""good"" momma bear) flattened by a tree. If the plot seems somewhat familiar, Disney made another animated film in 2003: ""Brother Bear"" where a human is turned into a bear. It didn't do too well at the box office either.",Brave
85,Sergeant_Tibbs,It's ironic for the first Pixar movie with actual magic involved has absolutely no movie magic of its own.,4,26 June 2013,"After Cars 2 showed a potential creative blip following Pixar's peak with Toy Story 3, Brave has come to confirm the stall. Perhaps the geniuses after the last run of charming films are basking in the success of their films and now the interns are having a go just to keep the Pixar factory line churning. The question is though, is it really worth it? Financially, sure, Brave was an obvious hit, but it's ironic for the first Pixar movie with actual magic involved has absolutely no movie magic of its own. Sure, the detail in the animation is impressive, but the story is just dire. It exclaims its themes (they say ""fate"" in the annoying Scottish accent far too many times), its content comes from nowhere, the characters are irritating and none of the sight gags are funny. There's a complete disregard for the adults in the audience as it's all spoonfed yet none of it is relatable or means anything. Worst of all, the protagonist isn't brave at all, just precocious. The direction is so unimaginative with very boring choice of shots and edits to display the action. To its credit, the original songs are pretty good but it just highlights how it's a by-the-numbers film. Even though my expectations were low, Brave is very disappointing, especially for Pixar.

We almost forget we are watching an animation movie at some moments. The character of Merida the young rebel princess is very well conceived and designed and it's also morally convincing.

87,Abdulxoxo,Not that brave in terms of storytelling,6,22 December 2020,"Brave is not nowhere on par with the rest of Pixar's films. It lacks the emotional depth and that 'original story' that Pixar cultivated in many of its film. Merida for a Disney princess, she's well drawn, she's got a good character that makes her a standout from the other princesses. She's independent, free-spirited, rides on horse and very good at archery. But as a main character in her own story she's very hard to be emotional connected to, and she come out as somewhat unlikable. The film's plot is very unoriginal and predictable, and it's got the old Disney tropes like curse, witch, forest and the before-sunrise thing.Technically it's very amazing ; The animation is top-notch as per usual for a Pixar movie; The fantasy elements and magical depictions are lovely, Merida hair's is very well done, the forests and landscapes are all breathtaking. The Voice acting is also impressive, the accent is spot-on. The soundtrack is memorable and does fits the atmosphere, it's got the Irish tones to it.
On the whole, Brave fails to provide an original story and engaging narrative but it does impress with amazing visuals, strong voice acting, and some themes that many people that relate to.",Brave

Filled with possibly Pixar's most attractive environments, character designs (Side note: Merida has my favorite character design of any animated human character. I mean seriously her hair alone is a thing of beauty.), and easily its best score, the studio does a deft send up of classic princess movies while instilling the pure feeling of magic they are known for though Scotland's rich Celtic lore and cryptic mysticism.

Brave is possibly their boldest attempt in some time, yet is also their least satisfying. Not only dark in themes – pondering the human cost of stubbornness, pride and unwavering vengeance – this Highlander tale is visually gloomy too, largely set in a murky forest and a dimly lit castle. The intensely dramatic tone (the climactic showdown between bears is absolutely vicious) and shadowy cinematography seldom lets up, but when it does there's plenty to enjoy. Not least Billy Connolly's affable buffoon King Fergus (surely a distant relative of Gerard Butler's Viking leader Stoik in How to Train Your Dragon), whose harmless oafishness is a delight to watch. The animation is naturally perfect, the 3D is utilised with care and a handful of gags certainly hit the spot, but this is one of those rare Pixar commodities: watchable, but not memorable.",Brave

95,petra_ste,The weight of expectations,6,6 August 2015,"Brave is, in itself, a droll, pleasant yarn about a rebellious princess in ancient Scotland. Package is flawless, with solid voice acting and splendid visuals.However, movies can't be judged in a vacuum - and this was made by Pixar, the animation studio which crafted some of the most imaginative, topical and daring (both in themes and form) mainstream movies of the last decade, from Finding Nemo to Inside Out. Compared to, say, the stunning, silent first half of Wall-E, or the opening montage about love and loss of Up, Brave is safe, lightweight fluff. Cue a zany witch, inevitable visual jokes about kilt-wearing highland warriors and bare rears, a curse with a prim queen mother turned into a bear (slapstick ensues), and so on. It's... okay, I guess? A fun adventure for kids - and yeah, the magical version of the typically unhelpful automated answering service had me in stitches. It just pales next to other Pixar movies (well, the majority of them), which are much more than that.6,5/10",Brave
96,fernandoschiavi,"Brave has a very great aesthetic quality and a round narrative, hitting the lesson and morals, but forgetting a little about humor",7,5 June 2021,"Since Pixar began its partnership with Disney, the studio has specialized in animating what was once considered inanimate. She never ventured into a narrative territory already explored to exhaustion by Mickey's House: the world of princesses. This was the case until the arrival of filmmaker Brenda Chapman (from the great ""The Prince of Egypt"") to the company that, together with her fellow director Mark Andrews, gave life to the brave young Scottish Merida, protagonist of this ""Brave"". Despite Chapman leaving the project before its completion due to infamous ""creative differences"", Andrews continued with the project he had conceived with her, pioneering a ""new"" theme for the studio and giving Pixar its first period feature. And, to top it off, his first production starring a female character.The film tells the story of Merida, daughter of King Fergus and Queen Elinor, who is about to come of age and, therefore, in order to follow the customs of the time, she will have her hand disputed by the princes of other families. Merida does not hesitate to show discontent with the customs of her people and ends up causing tension between the families. After meeting a witch and making a request that ends up causing more problems than solutions, Merida must race against time in order to avoid conflicts between the realms and save her mother's life.The first aspect to be raised from the film is that Merida is Pixar's first princess. Many will say that this is a direct Disney influence, but the character in this movie has a very different personality from those classic characters like Sleeping Beauty or Snow White. The red-haired princess is a warrior, cunning, rebellious and independent. On the other hand, she is a much firmer and more contextualized representation of a woman who has her own values and defends them, as opposed to a princess who is just waiting to be rescued by a prince charming.Merida is a young woman with contemporary thoughts and values, that's why at every moment she directly clashes with her mother's conservative values. From the first frame, Merida is seen as possessing a strong personality, although still immature, proving impossible to be contained, as the tears that end up marking her formal costume attest. She faces the disastrous consequences of her actions head-on, never being a girl who waits for a savior. The characters are charismatic, have depth, have human desires and yearnings. Together they illustrate a beautiful story that explores the meanings of freedom (and the way we seek it in our lives) and family.At the same time, it is also not forgotten that this is a teenager, having an inherent fragility of the character that only accentuates her nascent courage. All these factors work to reinforce Merida's character and maturity, even if she is not the only character to grow and reach the end of the projection changed by the events that took place, something that ends up being hammered in the viewer's head in an unsubtle way , a probable side effect of a very tweaked and written script with eight hands.Unlike other films that deal with relationships between friends, Brave is a film about family, and all its problems, especially in the relationship of parents and children, in the case of the film, Merida with her mother, Queen Elinor. It's not possible to talk about the movie without spoiling the plot's many surprises. But it's amazing to see how age doesn't matter, we've all had parental issues and the movie is about just that. And on top of that relationship the movie becomes and becomes something bigger than just an archery adventure as the trailers showed.In Brave, there is no romantic interest or antagonist in the story for the girl to fight. The closest thing the tape has to a ""villain"" is a bumbling witch, whose harmful actions are not driven by malice or greed, but by distraction. Even the ""demon bear"" Mordu, who wounds the King at the beginning of the tape and returns later, is more like an uncontrollable force of nature, never an evil element. Such characteristics, so typical of Japanese filmmaker Hayao Miyazaki's animations, end up dispelling any comparisons that could be made with ""The Little Mermaid"". There is a similarity between the two films, which is the difficulty of communication between the princess and one of her parents that triggers the disaster that gives rise to the plot. In Merida's case, we have the difficult relationship between her and her mother, highlighted through a beautiful scene in which the two rehearse what to say what they feel to each other, but never manage to engage in such a dialogue, not to mention the disastrous clash between they, which ends up generating a tense break between mother and daughter.The animal sidekick, something common in this genre, is present here too, but in a different way, very imaginative and exciting. We still have a good - and economical - use of the inevitable comic reliefs (in this case, the sons of Scottish lords and Merida's brothers), with these never appearing intrusively in the main plot. Patrick Doyle's soundtrack helps to evoke the mood of the story perfectly, although he uses songs to unnecessarily explain Merida's feelings in two moments of the projection.Despite Pixar's typical care and perfectionism in reproducing Scottish sets during production, especially in the castle, there is not a wide variety of environments throughout the tape, trying to disguise this problem with variations in photography, but it is all about a slip that impoverishes the art direction a little. Still, considering the fantastic production and character design (Merida's curls, as wild as she is, are a show in themselves), there's not much to complain about on the visual side. Some shots developed by Chapman and Andrews are breathtaking, such as Merida's intervention in the challenge of her suitors and her confrontation with the bear Mordu.Another strong point is the presence of nature, portrayed in a magnificent way with an impressive wealth of details: everything enchants, from the forest, the waterfalls, and the animals, with special emphasis on the portrayal of bears, beings that are important for In the film's plot, the bears have a wealth of detail so impressive that sometimes they don't even look like they were made by computer graphics. Brave is perhaps the greatest example of Pixar's computational care and polish, the pinnacle of the pixel manipulation technique. It turns out that the graphic quality doesn't stop there. Notice the textures of the shiny fabrics used in the dresses of Merida and her mother Elinor (Emma Thompson). Note the details of the patterns on the more brutish cloths of the kilts. Perceive the coat of the princess' horse mane, the nuances of scenes set at night or at dusk, the movement of each blade of grass, the texture of each rock.One of Pixar's strengths, the script of its stories, is basically Brave's main slip. It is, of course, a very beautiful film, with an enchanting look and a frightening perfectionism. But they are of little use in the face of a plot that takes time to get involved, and when it happens, it tastes like reheating. Here we have a young girl who refuses to face her responsibilities as a lady of the court - such as accepting a suitor chosen by her parents - and, in disgust, ends up making a deal with a witch. It is obvious that the hit will go wrong, and the one who will suffer will be the queen, her mother, who ends up being transformed into a giant bear. At this point, there is a race against time to undo the magic and regain the respect and affection of the father and the entire kingdom. Nothing that has not been seen before, under the most diverse molds. The surprise or twist in the story, despite making use of magic, is not magic. It's almost commonplace and, in a way, already done almost identically in Brother Bear, ironically from Disney. In fact, in this other drawing, the magical event is much more organic in relation to the story than what we have in Brave. So, what we see, starting in the second half of the film, is the forgetting of all the brilliant preparation that came before for the work to become something more standardized, of that style that we have already seen a few dozen times. The technical diligence continues, of course, but the script takes a noticeable drop, losing out on humor, acumen and character development.In any case, Brave, despite being, after all, a minor Pixar work or - using the inevitable comparison - a great movie if it were Disney or DreamWorks, deserves applause. In addition to the quality of computer graphics, Brave leaves us something else: a different princess, with a great personality, whose existence is not justified by the counterpart of a prince. Merida is Merida alone, in its own right. Brave has a very great aesthetic quality and a round narrative, hitting the lesson and morals, but forgetting a little about humor. Not that it's not possible to have fun, but this is not the time when Pixar has surpassed other successes (such as Wall-E, for example), but it is a respectable work to open the eyes of the most skeptical about the future of the company.",Brave
97,Animany94,Not the usual Pixar quality.,5,9 May 2019,"When I first saw Brave, I wasn't impressed like I usually am by Pixar.The premise is pretty generic and the mother/daughter relationship isn't very interesting, because of the clichéd story of rebelling against the old traditions of royalty. And to be honest, I didn't find Merida that likable when she more or less constantly bickered and argued with her mother. Not much new done with this material in an already lackluster story.The other members of the clan can be entertaining and the animation is beautiful as always with Pixar, but visual brilliance is only surface level quality, because a well crafted story can save mediocre animation, but not the other way around in my book.And out of all animals you can think of why should the mother be turned into a bear? Disney already given us Brother Bear, but at the very least Pixar didn't make it talk and instead added a little fun mannerisms.Mediocre by Pixar standards, but harmless as a movie in general.

99,ja_kitty_71,My top favorite film from Pixar,10,9 July 2012,"I had seen it at theaters, and now Brave is my top favorite film from Pixar because of it's beautiful soundtrack by Patrick Doyle (Quest for Camelot) and the film's leading lady. I really hated the ""bashing"" I would see over the internet.The story is about the tomboyish Princess Merida, who grows tired of her daily life of restricting princess lessons from her queenly mother Elinor. Merida then decides to go against the royal traditions, which is refusing to take a husband from the oldest son of one of three lords from other clans. Seeking to change her fate, Merida receives a spell from a reclusive, eccentric forest witch, but by doing this, unleashes a terrible ancient curse. That is all I could tell you. And I don't favorite a scene (as I said many times), because I love the whole film from beginning to end.One thing I would like point out is that why would they at Pixar would choose the name ""Merida"" because some Scottish names are hard for kids to pronounce. Another reason is that I thought since the film is set in the Dark Ages, in the pre-written times of a Celtic people known as the Pictish, predating the Roman era in Scotland's history, where Latin was still spoken; it is a Latin name. Also I had read it in ""The Art of Brave"" book.",Brave
100,MihaiSorinToma,One of the best animations ever made,10,7 February 2018,"Merida is an unusual princess. She's not very well mannered, she's very stubborn, she's not even good at being a princess, but she's the best archer of all. Being under constant supervision from her very strict mother who wishes to ""train"" her daughter as herself, Merida even feels her freedom slipping away. Thus, when the time comes for her to choose a husband from the other three clans, a huge argument occurs between her and her mother which is about to introduce a change in their relationship and even regarding the future of the kingdom, for better or worse.It's an animation which follows Merida, the young red-haired princess, who seems to love her bow and her freedom more than her kingdom, as she's about to face the biggest challenge of her life. Her whole world will be turned upside down after what looks like a disastrous mistake, so she'll have to rethink it all in an attempt to make things right. This movie features an apparently simplistic plot which will prove to be much more complex and well put together, managing to create a wonderful world for the action to take place. Its characters are simply superb, very well thought, described and also animated, being able to create an unique atmosphere, one which you'll definitely enjoy.Besides its intense action sequences, the movie generates so much emotion, so much drama, especially as you get attached to the characters, that you'll always be eager to find out what will happen next. And to make matters even better, it possesses an incredible sense of humor. The amount of moments which will make you laugh out loud is simply astonishing and incredible, not to mention that it leaves the impression that it's not even trying. In terms of visuals, the movie is simply gorgeous. Flawlessly animated and very well colored, it also presents some breathtaking scenery which is sure to impress anyone who sees it.To sum things up, it's a truly impressive movie, with a very good story and impressive characters, superbly animated and extremely funny which managed to impress me multiple times, even more as time passes, making it one of the best pieces of animation out there. A true masterpiece!",Brave
101,gavin-thelordofthefu-48-460297,"Not in the same depth as Pixar's previous films, but a touching and entertaining movie",8,1 September 2012,"After Pixar released their first critical failure, Cars 2, they tried to do another ground-breaker which would hopefully be a classic to die-hard Pixar fans by making their very first fairy tale known as Brave and it's their very first Pixar film to feature a female protagonist. Now, I know what all of you are thinking. ""Oh, this is a girls movie, why did you went to see it despite the fact that you're a boy?"" Well, since I'm a hardcore animation fan, I would watch any kind of animated film that is gender-related, not animal animated films that I've seen the past few years.So, what do I think about this film? Well, I will say that while it's not in the same depth as Toy Story, Finding Nemo or some of Pixar's previous films, this is a very entertaining film like any other animated movie should be except the ones that are completely horrible (That's right. I'm looking at you, Secret of Nimh 2. You too, The Magic Voyage).Sure the story uses elements from Disney's The Little Mermaid and Brother Bear and the pacing dragged the entire movie too fast, but those flaws are overshadowed by it's beautiful animation (even the look of the main character Princess Merida's hair was so realistic), a great voice cast with the help of Kelly McDonald, Emma Thompson, Billy Connolly, Robbie Coltrane, and Craig Ferguson, and it's smart and witty script.The characters are likable especially Princess Merida and I liked the way she shoots some arrows and sword-fights. How awesome is that? Anyway, her mother, Queen Elinor, her father, King Fergus, and the three clans are likable too. Even the interactions between Merida and Elinor are enjoyable, but not only that. They're heartwarming and tear-jerking (especially near the end of the movie) There are some dark moments that would frighten younger kids, but I think that the parts with the monstrous bear scared the living heck out of me. The strongest aspects goes to the magnificent storytelling, it's hilarious moments with the triplet brothers (they're likable too), and the lovely music score from Patrick Doyle and I liked the songs ""Touch The Sky"" ""Into The Open Air"" and ""Learn Me Right"".Overall, not as excellent as Pixar's previous films, but a touching and entertaining movie worth watching. Thumbs up!",Brave
102,witster18,"Yes, this could have been even better, but it's certainly better than many of the negative reviews. See it.",7,7 April 2013,"VERY MINOR spoilers.No, Brave isn't Pixars Best. Personally, I wouldn't even call it the best animated film of 2012(it did win the Oscar). I might give an ever-so-slight edge to Wreck-it-Ralph for that honor, but it's close. Ralph has a bigger heart, and more interesting characters, but the animation from Pixar for Brave, is frankly, in a different time-zone.You would expect from Pixar,.. it looks FANTASTIC. They continue to push the bar higher and higher in terms of animation.Secondly, it's not bogged down with too much music. I think this really opens-up the entire genre for rock-heads like myself, who don't care to listen to one celine-dion-esque sap-song after another.The pacing is excellent. There's no lulls in this one. I can't tell you how many times I've really enjoyed an animated film, only to have it start to bore me 2/3rd's of the way through(How to Train Your Dragon comes to mind - although I'm sure the comparison will throw some off).Brave is bold and beautiful to look at, and it has a pretty big heart as well. We don't get too many of these films that address mother-daughter relationship issues, and Brave definitely has its heart in the right place.The film is funny and exciting throughout.That said, what's keeping this at 77/100 for me is in all the little areas where the film could have expanded, but didn't. The back-story about rival clans and a cursed-prince fall flat. The film seems a bit-rushed at 1hr and 36 minutes, and to it's credit it flies by and entertains for sure, but I wouldn't mind seeing the 2-Hr and fifteen minute version that expanded on this story's history AND ending.Not at all surprised by the Oscar though, now that I've seen it.Recommended for sure.You Might Like This If You Liked:Beowulf(not nearly as good as this), The Incredibles(a touch better), and Coraline(even, or a touch better).good movie! I might have to review both Wreck-it-Ralph and Brave again to confirm my first instincts. They're both clearly the best animated films I've seen from 2012(granted, I've only seen 5 or 6). Don't put it off anymore if you have, it's about as adult-friendly a fine animated film as you're likely to see.",Brave
103,ofpsmith,I thought it was good.,8,22 March 2015,"I was looking through some of the other reviews for this movie and for the most part, they all seemed to be pretty negative. I'm not really sure why. I thought it was good. Granted it wasn't Pixar's best film, and lot's of elements of it seemed to be a repeat of the past but overall, I thought it was pretty good. I enjoyed it and so did my family. In the middle ages of Scotland Merida (Kelly MacDonald) is a willful young princess who has to get married as a rite of passage. Instead she decides to go against the wishes of her mother Elinor (Emma Thompson) and inadvertently turns her into a bear. well this comes as a problem because King Fergus (Billy Connolly) Merida's father is known as the bear king because a bear once had a fight with him. The rest is all typical Disney. Overall even though lots of parts of the story were overused, I still found it enjoyable. I recommend it over some other alternatives.",Brave
104,CountZero313,Love Scotland. Love Pixar. Not too keen on this.,5,18 March 2013,"'Brave' has been taking some hits, especially since garnering an undeserved Oscar, and it is not hard to see why. By Pixar's own high standards, and especially their famed commitment to storytelling, this film fails to engage with its audience. My kids came out of Toy Story and Monsters Inc saying ""Wow"", but reacted to Brave with ""s'awright."" That clinches it for me.The problem lies in the supernatural element that compromises character-driven action. Nemo's father goes on a journey that forces him to face his fears. He overcomes his challenges by compassion and daring. Merida goes on a journey instigated by, and resolved with the help of, Will O' the Wisp. This deus ex machina element robs Brave of the cathartic power previous Pixar films have achieved.The visual comedy was also rather sporadic and subdued. A few clichéd pokes at Scotland were unimaginative; haggis as inedible, no pants under kilts - moments that also passed children by. The suitor with the incomprehensible accent raised a smile with us, but we've had more and better laughs with Pixar in the past.Back to basics, Pixar people.",Brave
105,JohnRayPeterson,"Pixar quality animation, a personal delight",8,20 December 2012,"The storyline is not very unusual, perhaps even standard fare, but there's no doubt about Pixar's fine animation; the picture is clear and the movement of the characters as good as it gets. The technical advancement, over the years, in how the animation of the character's hair looks and flows, starting with the movie 'The Incredibles', eight years ago, still amazes me. The movie is pleasant to the eye from start to finish. Given that the story takes place in Scotland during what I like to think as medieval times, even if the promotion calls it mythical times, casting was as good as it could possibly have been, with Kelly Macdonnald and Billy Connolly, Scottish born and well recognized voices in the lead; the rest of the featured cast were all very familiar voices to me and in no small measure the reason I wanted to see this movie. I was delighted by all of them, absolutely delighted. Directors Mark Andrews (also Scottish) and Brenda Chapman were an excellent choice by the producers; their talent for such a project was tried and tested before, with honors. If you are due for something nice to watch, and an easy adventure is something that would fit the bill, watch it; it will put you in a good mood. You don't even have to watch it with your children to appreciate it.",Brave
106,ersinkdotcom,"Disney and Pixar's ""Brave"" satisfies",7,14 November 2012,"As I begin this review, I should confess I'm not a big Pixar fan. Although I do recognize the charm the films hold, I don't find them as entertaining as most people do. Much of that has to do with the animation style. The environments look great, but I find the human beings to resemble lifeless marionettes many times. The atmospheres of the movies are too ""cute"" for me as well. I'm not big on ""cute"" when it comes to animated movies.All that being said, Disney and Pixar's ""Brave"" is as good as their films come. It has all the right elements of a classic fairy tale with a few twists thrown in to keep things modernized. There's a princess, a witch, and some kooky animals in a faraway land.The only thing missing is a prince to save the day. Princess Merida (Kelly Macdonald) makes it very clear to her parents that she doesn't need a prince to fulfill her life's ambitions or save her. She wants to live life on her own terms free of the trappings and responsibilities of being royalty.Merida stumbles upon a witch (Julie Walters) that gives her a spell to change the Queen's (Emma Thompson) mind about marrying one of three suitors from other clans. The spell does more than change her mother's mind; it physically transforms her into the most feared creature in the kingdom - a gargantuan bear. Merida frantically looks for a way to change the Queen back before her father (Billy Connolly) and fellow huntsmen track her down. They mistakenly believe her to be the bear that took the King's leg.In usual fashion, there are lessons for everyone to learn in ""Brave."" One is children should be careful what they wish for and value their parents. The other is that parents should give children the freedom to choose their own paths in life. It wouldn't be a Disney or Pixar movie without some sort of words of wisdom.""Brave"" is successful as a whole. I'm glad I gave it a chance after skipping it in theaters. The initial marketing campaign for the movie offered no real motivation for me to see it in theaters. I did get a bit frustrated during the climax with some of Merida's illogical decisions. The different settings in the film really do carry you away to a fantasy world and help put you into the middle of the story and action.",Brave
107,Likes_Ninjas90,Pencil it in for a Best Animated Oscar,9,17 June 2012,"In the Scottish highlands of DunBroch Princess Merida (voiced by Kelly Macdonald) is constantly being ushered about how to act in her life. Her parents are King Fergus (Billy Connolly) and his wife Queen Elinor (Emma Thompson) and it is the latter that is most controlling towards Merida's behaviour. Merida enjoys adventuring by herself, including horseback riding and firing off her bow and arrow. Yet her life comes unstuck when her mother announces that she is arranging for her to be married. A number of rival suitors are invited to prove themselves as worthy but Merida is bored by all of them. After an argument with her mother, Merida finds a witch (Julie Walters) and purchases a spell that she hopes will change her mother's mind about the marriage. Yet it has unforeseen consequences that forces Merida to take responsibility for her actions. They've done it again. Since their first animated feature Toy Story in 1995, the animation giant Pixar have continued to show a maturity towards characters that few other studios can understand. Brave is Pixar's 13th feature film and is credited to three directors, one of which was Brenda Chapman. She originally conceived the film, planning for Reese Witherspoon to voice Merida, but she was replaced by Mark Andrews and Steve Purcell. A lot of has been said about Chapman's involvement and the significance of Merida as the studio's first female heroine too. Is gender politics relevant here or just a naive attempt to push this openly liberal company towards political correctness? Pixar have never catered to the boys club and their films should never be considered gender specific either. They have had numerous female characters in almost all of their other films. Boo (Monsters, Inc.) and EVE (WALL-E), for example, were highly significant parts of their respective films. Similarly, Mr. Incredible (The Incredibles) was frequently accompanied by his entire family, which included both his wife and his teenage daughter. Pixar have openly stated, quite accurately, that they don't make films for children: they make films for everyone. In a period where an increasing number of Hollywood features are aimed at young teenage boys, I have long been fascinated by this statement. The company strives for universal appeal in their work, which is why all of their films are so popular. Upholding this standard is Brave and it's a bullseye. The film might rest in the palm of a spritely red-haired Princess who does it her way, but there is no limit in her appeal or the spectator's ability to emphasise with her. Consider a scene where Merida fights with her parents about who she wants to be and what she wants to do with herself. How is a moment of conflict like this not universally applicable? I think 'Brave' would also be a title fitting for the studio itself. There would be few others willing enough to include scenes of domestic disputes, like Merida telling her mother that she does not want to be like her, or parents fighting amongst each other for the path they individually believe their children should take. There are clever scenes that carry this subtext, meaning that Pixar continues to push the envelope, challenging the audience and allowing us to form more meaningful attachments to these characters because the situations are relatable. Their earnestness is fitting because today under the Obama administration the rest of Hollywood is also beginning to distance itself from conservative messages like 'be yourself,' in favour of family films such as Tangled (2010), We Bought a Zoo (2011) and How to Train Your Dragon (2010), which rightly encourage children to take chance and more risks in life. Brave is a wonderful continuation of this message, as Merida looks for her freedom, but like all great fairy tales it also about how personal hubris forces change in both adults and children alike. This progression is embedded in a narrative that does take its time to warm up but builds excitingly into a cautionary tale that is incredibly touching. As with all great Pixar films there is an emotional attachment to the story that is born through the clarity of the characters motives. Smartly, the film also refuses to ling too long over its more dramatic moments. There's as much tension as humour and personality here too, including a hairy scene involving an escape from a bear that might be a little scary for very small children. There is also fun to be had with the film's supreme visual design too. Watching the film in 3D, it is a lavish argument for how the extra dimension benefits from wide open spaces. Recently, I was critical of Prometheus's superfluous use of 3D. This is because narrow corridors are often too contained for the 3D technology to be effective. The open spatiality of Brave allows for more fluidity in the camera's movements, providing a spectacular sense of flight. This sense of freedom, reflecting the frivolity of Merida's escape from the kingdom, is enhanced by long shots and sweeping camera motions. In effect it provides the frames with a visible sense of scale, height and depth. The colour selection is impeccable too. As Merida walks through the forest, her bright red hair contrasts the greenery of the woodlands and faint blue lights glow luminously in front of her. By contrast, there is also a special moment where Merida crosses over some fallen ruins and the frame is purposely desaturated, removing the colour and replacing it with a hazy fog that disrupts our sense of geography. It is a shame that the later scenes are quite dark, meaning there is less opportunity to enjoy the colour and proves at odds with the lenses on the 3D glasses. It is a minor complaint in an otherwise impeccably crafted film. Pencil it in for a Best Animated Oscar.",Brave
108,Christian_Dimartino,Pixar has it's dazzle back.,9,28 June 2012,"After last year's Cars 2 became a critical misfire, people were wondering if Pixar, the company who brought us wonderful films like Ratatouille, Up, and Finding Nemo, had lost it's luster. Last night I saw their newest film Brave, and although it's not as good as some of the others, it still has Pixar's magic.It's weird to think that after all these years, Pixar hasn't had a female heroine. But now they do, and he name is Merida(voiced by the wonderful Kelly McDonald). Merida doesn't act like a normal princess because of her love for archery, or so her mum(voiced by Emma Thompson)thinks. Her and her mum don't get along very well.After her mum tells her that she must find a suitor to marry, Merida runs off to the woods where she meets a witch(voiced by Julie Waters), and will do anything to change her mom's mind. So she simply wishes to put a spell on her, a spell that will change her mind, and other things.Brave is a wonderful film, one of the best films of the Summer so far. The animation is gorgeous, the characters are adorable, the film is at times hilarious, the story is sweet and has a big heart, and Merida is truly a Pixar hero to remember. I cannot rank this with Toy Story, Toy Story 3, Finding Nemo, Ratatouille (my favorite of the bunch), Walle, or Up.Now I will rank it with Cars, A Bug's Life, Toy Story 2, Monster's Inc, The Increadibles, and even though I missed out on Cars 2, i'm sure it's a crap ton better. This is a really good movie that kids will love, and parents will have a laugh too. I was almost too dazzled by Pixar's Brave.A-",Brave
109,griffolyon12,Far From Pixar's Best,6,17 December 2012,"To clarify, Disney/Pixar's Brave is not the worst time at a movie theater you will ever have, it just falls drastically short of the usual Pixar pedigree. When a feisty princess in a fantasy realm -- oddly reminiscent of Dreamworks' How to Train Your Dragon -- asks a witch for a spell, she accidentally turns her overbearing mother into a giant bear (no pun intended) and must help turn her back into a human. Brave is charming and innocent in the way that most Pixar movies are, with none of the little winks and nudges included for the adult crowd that most other animation studios offer, but it's the fact that the story just feels so uninspired that really gets me. Pixar has a knack for being original and telling stories that have never been told before, and this story just feels like a run of the mill Disney fairy tale, without any of the charm that comes when based on a pre-existing story that you already know and love. The characters are fairly standard for such a film, and the plot is sluggish to reach its finale. Overall, the animation is beautiful and it should entertain, but don't expect another Pixar masterpiece.I give Brave a 6 out of 10!",Brave
110,Imdbidia,"Beautiful Animation, Senseless script",6,1 September 2012,"Pixar lost a bit its essence and idiosyncrasy when it was engulfed by Disney. Since then, every second Pixar movie we get can be labeled Pixar's in conception, ideas and originality. The in-between years are for movies like Brave, which follow a ready-made template with structured predefined characters, values and jokes that are very much modern Disney. This is, moreover, Pixar's fist princess movie ever.Brave's animation is amazing from a visual point of view: the colors, layouts, backgrounds, the rendering of the landscapes and characters movement, the camera angling, the 3D design and even the movement of the hair of Merida are spectacular. Still, a good animation movie, to be successful, needs of a good script with a sound story and narrative: what it tells and how it tells it are always more important than how it looks like. Brave's script -by Mark Andrews, Steve Purcell, Brenda Chapman and Irene Mecchi- is, a priory, a winner, as it mixes many European folk legends and human archetypes (like the ones we see in Anderson or the Grimm Brothers' tales) with modern attitudes and sensibilities. Moreover, Merida is in a way, a combination of all the successful past Disney's heroines. Thus, Merida is a redhead tomboy princess, opinionated and rebel, super-woman at every level, living in a Medieval Scottish male dominated kingdom that is brought up to be a queen.The film is entertaining and beautiful to watch, and some of the characters are very funny. There are many funny moments especially those involving the witch, Merida's triplet brothers, and the lady bear. All the cast of actors do a good job at dubbing their respective characters: Kelly Macdonald as Merida, Billy Connolly as Merida's father, Emma Thompson as her mother, and Julie Walters as the Witch. To be completely honest, Billy Connolly's dubbing always sounds like himself not as the character he plays. Still, Brave does not deliver beyond the artistic qualities of the animation, because the story sends contradictory and senseless messages to the children it targets. It feels as if the writing team had done bit and pieces separately, and then stitched them together without further adjustment and polishing. Being so, the movie can be labeled, depending on the moment, of feminist, sexist, retrograde, modern, advanced or conservative. ""Obey your mother"" can be a revolutionary message in a world in which children are spoiled rotten and disrespect their parents, but going from there to deciding that everything mammy says is good for your future and that the tradition has to be respected no matter how senseless it is, it is a bit reactionary. On the other hand, the story tells us that you can be brave and daring, but until certain point - bravery is subversive, and subversion is not good. What?! Be brave and make your own fate, free will do exist, but fate is fateful and will crash you if you subvert the status-quo. What! What? What?!Too much is always too much. Brave is a beautiful senseless sermon that gets lost in its own wordiness and senseless preaching. It is perfect for small children, as it has lots of action and some funny moments that the little ones (and your inner child) will enjoy. More sounded boys and girl, our just your sound self, could get a bit puzzled at the moral of the story and the wordy ending.",Brave

It is the 13th Pixar film,and certainly a great one as their previous.Brave follows Merida the daughter of Scottish King Fergus and Queen Elinor. She is a skilled archer who wants to make her own fate in life and pursue her own dreams. She is then forced to get married,as the tradition requires at a certain age but she is in her own mind and seeks help from a witch to change the fate and be her own person in life.This movie is amazing,from the glorious animation to the characters who are likable just as much as they are interesting. Merida is a strong female lead character who chooses her own path in life and makes her own decisions for herself. She has dreams and most importantly is ""brave"" enough to pursue them till the very end. She's also smart and Kelly Macdonald's voice work just helps the cause with her amazing Scottish Accent.The story is very interesting and intriguing while still being emotional that gives depth to the characters. But it also has funny moments throughout,even though the finale is very dark and also even sad which in my opinion is great.People has been complaining about the twist over and over again and how it is more of a kids film than for adults,which Pixar is used to making. But I disagree because while it is an absolute treat for kids,it is also dark at times,it has adult jokes here and there and what's very important,it has character development at its finest. The place where Merida and different characters in the movie are at the beginning and where they end up is just brilliant and life changing. The lessons they learn through their adventures,them being good or bad,and the way that this movie teaches people that we can make our own fate if we are brave enough to follow our hearts,that makes for an unforgettable experience.",Brave
113,Beejerman,JUST OKAY - (6 stars out of 10),6,27 April 2019,"The stage curtains open ...Though ""Brave"" offers stunning visuals, awesome computer graphics and animation, the story is rather plain and mundane. It is the stuff that little children's fairy tales are made of. A morality tale ... you know, the kind of story that ends with - ""and the moral of the story is...""It is the story of a Scottish mother and her daughter - the Queen and her Princess - proper behavior and etiquette for a girl who would rather be riding her horse out in the wilds of the woods, flinging her arrows into the air, than taking care of matters of court. But when Queen Elinor becomes most insistent that her daughter, Merida, choose a marriage mate from three inept suitors - Merida resorts to having a spell conjured that will change her mother's mind ... leading to disastrous results that she must correct before it is too late.We've all heard this story on one level or another in various different circumstances over the years. It is a 10-minute-tale that is dragged over 93 minutes that relies very heavily on visual content and humorous effects. It is easy to see why it has received such good reviews - and for the younger kids, it is going to please and satisfy. For adults however, it just doesn't have that cutting edge.This isn't necessarily a recommend, and yet it is definitely worth the watch. It has some memorable scenes and a decent soundtrack. It leans heavy on action and fantasy elements but has enough witty dialogue to keep it interesting. I felt ""Brave"" was just okay overall. It isn't a favorite of mine among Pixar films, but not bad either.",Brave
114,billygoat1071,A Simple Magic,8,5 August 2012,"The reason why Pixar movies are so special not only because of the filmmaking but also because of their creative high concepts and their heartfelt messages. They have their own kind of magic. Brave has it all but it sometimes feel different. The story is good but the idea is not as mind boggling as their other films. The only thing remains intact here is the heart. Despite from all that, it's still a wonderful film. But some might still be disappointed.Brave has a little originality to its story. We don't see anything very intriguing but the wisps. The rest is something that we've already seen in other animated movies. But the film obviously points out at the message. Pixar finally returns at bringing genuine emotions after the Cars 2 fiasco last year, but this film doesn't go deeper until the third act. The movie is plodded with too much humor in the intro which it delays to the main plot. It's better when it finally goes to the story.Some might still complain about being different to the usual Pixar animation. It is different and indeed feels more like a standard Disney animated film than Pixar. The main reason is the lack of high concepts. This is probably the least interesting concept among the others, but again it is more about the heart. The animation just got better. The visuals are undeniably gorgeous and it's enough for making this worth watching. The cast gave plenty of personality to their roles. The score is wonderful and exciting.Overall, it's a great movie but it's kind of out of place as a Pixar film because it doesn't have any intriguing ideas like toys coming to life, daily life of monsters, a superhero family, a flying house, rats can cook, etc. But the heart is still there and it works effectively. Maybe they wanted to try to be basic and leave the high concepts for a while. For now, we have a heartwarming tale about family. The filmmaking is without a doubt well done. The animation looks great. Pixar never fail at making good movies. Since this is not their best, at least they gave us something sweeter and absolutely beautiful.",Brave
115,dilipbts,Brave,8,29 April 2020,"While I must admit that ""Brave"" is not among my favorite Pixar films, I was totally blown away by the computer graphics. To some extent this is to be expected--as years pass, the CGI is bound to get better and better. But it's more than that--the textures, colors and depth were all incredible and I was in love with the animation throughout.As far as the story goes, it was a mixed bag. While I was thrilled to see a Pixar film with female leads AND featuring a mother-daughter relationship, the story itself seemed a bit shallow and flat. It wasn't bad, but never hit that emotional spot within that you'd find in ""Up"" or ""Toy Story 3"". Now this isn't to say it's bad---it just isn't among the very best of the studio and is STILL well worth seeing. It's especially nice to see a FEMALE protagonist--and one who does NOT need to be rescued by a prince! Incidentally, my daughter and her friend loved the film--and my bet is that girls would generally prefer this film but it's a lot of fun for everyone.By the way, there is a cute inside joke in the film in which they mention someone being out of town at the ""Wicker Man"" ceremony! This could be a reference to the wonderful 1970s film (see this one--not the remake) or to the actual ancient ceremony. I actually had no idea that this was a real event until dlwagner sent me an email informing me of this--but I certainly did NOT expect to hear them talking about it in ""Brave"".",Brave
116,bheadher,A delightful flight into fantasy...,8,6 May 2017,"I am frankly amazed at the many negative reviews, half blaming Pixar for being Pixar and the other half blaming Disney for latching onto Pixar...This movie isn't Wall-e, and I doubt they ever intended it to be similar. Where Wall-e had a moral picking at the recesses of your mind all the way through, Brave has a very subtle message, that is neither flaunted nor shoved at you...The movie treats you to pure entertainment, with no agenda either apparent nor implied. Perhaps that is what all the negative reviewers were looking for, an agenda...instead, what is presented to you is a simple story of a family that learns, on several levels, what being family is all about...It isn't tradition, it is Pixar through and through...",Brave

118,TheSquiss,"Exquisite scenery, shame about the plot.",5,30 August 2012,"There are certain unwritten rules by which we all abide and one of those seems to be that it is entirely unacceptable to dislike a Pixar film. Fortunately, Brave is likable.I didn't say it's brilliant, just likable.Much has been said about Brave being the first Pixar film with a female protagonist but that is far from being the reason to see it. Back in 1995 we marveled at the uniqueness of Toy Story and how new benchmarks had been set in much the same way as with Spielberg's Jurassic Park. Then, in 2001, we raved at how far Pixar had advanced and delighted in the movement of Sulley's hair. Today, I gawped at the vast screen and was stunned, amazed at the almost photo-reality of the Scottish scenery. Lochs, mountains, glens and clouds filled the screen as the camera glided across the Highlands so perfectly defined that the panoramas could almost have been lifted from a documentary.I have nothing but the highest praise for the scenery, the backgrounds of Brave. What troubles me is that that is what was foremost in my mind after 100 minutes of animated magic.It's not a bad film, not by a very long way, but it is weak. The plot is simpler than implied by the trailer (Princess Merida takes umbrage at her parents' plans for her betrothal to one of three clan chief's sons and heads off into the woods with a scheme that, naturally, goes awry) and has but a single strand. There are no great subplots, no great surprises, no great laughs, no great scares It weaves along happily with some pleasant touches, a few smiles and a couple of cute episodes but there's nothing really about Brave that stands out. There are no jaw-dropping scenes, no standout moments to talk about later (WALL-E keeping the box but discarding the ring, Buzz Lightyear actually flying...) and no memorable quotes with which to entertain over dinner.There are plenty of adequate vocal performances: Kelly Macdonald gives life and emotion to Princess Merida while Billy Connolly obviously relishes his latest animated role and a fine supporting cast, led by Julie Walters and Robbie Coltrane, make the most of their expanded cameos without being particularly memorable. The surprise amongst the cast is Emma Thompson as Princess Merida mother, Elinor. Her vocals, in my distinctly English ears, were perfect but, in much the same way it was baffling why Mike Myers played Shrek as Ewan McGregor instead of casting Ewan McGregor in the first place, it seems a little odd that Thompson was cast instead of, say, Blythe Duff or, oh, um Maybe that's why. Surely there must be more Scots actresses.For those south of the Hadrian's Wall, there is still a week or so of summer holidays and this is almost certainly the best of the pick if you have a(nother) rainy day and stir-crazy children, but I can't help thinking there'll be far more memorable and entertaining cinema outings in the autumn with the arrival of Tim Burton's Frankenweenie, Rise of the Guardians and even Paranorman.In five years time when you find yourself reviewing Pixar's finest moments, I suspect Brave will not immediately come to mind. Certainly, it will rank above Robots and Cars 2, but it falls a long way short of Monsters Inc., WALL-E and Toy Story. But at least the scenery was attractive.",Brave

120,cultfilmfreaksdotcom,Unbearably Misleading,1,23 June 2012,"This is the epitome of burying the lead But the trailer seemed a bit strange to begin with. Instead of the usual montage summing up the entire movie, or at least half of it, we get one scene: an assertive tomboy princess with neat looking fiery red hair shoots an arrow to choose her own fate instead of a bunch of losers vying to marry her: the one that hits the bulls eye wins her hand in marriage. (Let's make it clear, all three young men are pathetic wrecks: if one resembled an Elfin Johnny Depp with half a brain, perhaps there'd be no story at all.) After our frustrated heroine, Princess Merida, hits all the marks by herself, the real tale begins – and not only is it strange, awkward and confusing, but even the target-audience children might shake their heads in disbelief.Merida, in order to change her destiny, seeks a forest witch who gives her a spell. Then, back at the castle, Merida offers her mom – the person really in charge of this arranged marriage thing – a spiked muffin that quickly changes her into a giant bear! This was unplanned; Merida wanted to change her mother, not change her mother. The rest of the movie has the Princess keeping Mother Bear away from her huntsman father who, years earlier and as the film began, lost his leg battling a you got it bear. And then her three troublesome little brothers turn into bears and there's the one big bad bear from the intro that's part of a confusing backstory about a fallen prince.So with all the potential of setting a movie in the time where trolls and gnomes and dragons and fairies and kings and queens and knights could have roamed the mystical Celtic countryside, we get a bunch of common bears and a stretched-out story lacking a real plot, leaving only the memory of that ""trailer"" that would have made a fantastic short film to open a real movie with.For More Reviews: www.cultfilmfreaks.com",Brave
121,richieandsam,"Not a classic Disney film, but still very good.",7,27 December 2013,"BRAVESo for Christmas, my parents got me a few of the Disney films missing from my collection. Today I watched Brave. I had never seen this one before which is not like me... I normally see them in the cinema, but for some reason this one passed me by.The movie is about a Scottish princess who is being forced to get married, but she really doesn't want to. So one day when going through a forest she stumbles across a witches house, she decides to purchase a spell from her to change her mother. The problem is, she wanted to change her mothers opinions on the forced marriage... instead she changed her mother into a bear. Now she has to find a way of changing her mother back into a human before her father finds the bear. Her father kills them.It is a great story, but I am sure Disney have done this before... or at least very similar. Brother Bear is similar to this. There are obvious differences, but they are both about them trying to find ways of changing someone important back from a bear.The animation is brilliant as always, but I find it very hard to fault Disney of their animation. I honestly believe they are the best in the world.As always there are some musical numbers in the movie. They were quite good, but not very memorable. They just didn't seem to have the typical Disney hook. They were not very catchy. But they still fit in with the movie quite well.There were some very funny moments in the movie which made me and my family laugh.The voice work was also very good like normal, the only problem I would say with it though is, there were a lot of famous people used for the voice work in this movie, but I only recognised one voice. They really could have just got anyone to do the voices. The main recognisable voice was done by Billy Connolly. He has such a distinctive voice that I could tell, it was him straight away. Other voice artists were Kelly Macdonald, Emma Thompson, Julie Walters & Robbie Coltrane. I didn't know these guys did the voices until the end credits of the movie.If you are a fan of Disney, then I recommend this to you. It is very entertaining for you and the kids. Yet again Disney did not disappoint.I will give this film 7 out of 10.""If you had a chance to change your fate, would you?""For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204",Brave
122,JakeBrinkman,Stays too safe,3,12 June 2019,"For a movie that's supposed to be questioning gender roles, it never shows Merida doing anything incredibly ""masculine"" compared with other Disney princesses. Mulan does a far better job of that. The humor is also extremely childish, and none of the characters have any dimensional personality aside from Merida and her mother.It has an amazing setting, but it lacks its own unique story. Everything about it seems borrowed from Mulan, Robin Hood, Princess and the Frog, and probably more. The one fresh aspect, the child challenging the parents, is never really shown in a way to convince the viewer that the two really have changed to see each other's viewpoint. Disney then remedied that by having a much better story in Inside Out, making Brave entirely obsolete.",Brave

124,lagudafuad,Not so special but not that bad,6,27 June 2012,"Enjoyable, especially if you don't know much about the movie and you stayed away from the trailers, I was surprised at the turn of events majorly the whole mother and daughter connection. A change from the regular, having a female lead is something, having two female leads and no romance or male attachment involved is a stab in the dark.Was I looking forward to what will happen next each time? YES.Brave is a 3D computer-animated fantasy adventure film from Pixar. It was set in the highlands of 10th century Scotland, and the lead role Merida is Pixar's first female protagonist. The movie is directed by Brenda Chapman who is Pixar's first female director and she also wrote the story.The thing I want you to look out for when you are watching this movie is Merida's brothers, those kids were a menace to the power of 3.Giving you the plot of the movie without revealing much is going to be quite hard, but I will try. Merida defies an age-old custom, causing chaos in her kingdom. After consulting with a witch for help, she is given a cake that caused a change of events in her family, now Merida has to undo the spell herself before it is too late.The movie's flow is kind of shallow, and the movie looked short, like more could have happened and it didn't. You will love the scenery and the way the women were different from the men in the area of manners and thought. The movie did drive a message though, that both mothers and daughters have to communicate, with both leaving room to understand the other. But the message may not go down well the male viewers who were probably looking for some action.Voice casting is a part of the movie I enjoyed. It was Scottish to the core.I can't say for certain if the movie will bring in the regular money that Pixar is use to too, but I do know it is not a bad watch. It is something you will enjoy.",Brave
125,diac228,"Still not back to masterpiece form, but Pixar slightly redeems with Brave",8,22 June 2012,"Cars 2 was the ultimate proof that Pixar is indeed mortal and capable of producing filth.Brave is proof that Pixar still has a ways to go before reaching its previous masterpiece status---the movie didn't even feel like it matched the title.But despite not having the emotional complexity of Up, the humor of Toy Story 2, or even the distinctive creativity of Monster's Inc., Brave still works in many levels and will entertain us all just like your usual Pixar fare. Like Pixar's best, there was a clear multitude of effort in terms of the storytelling, the voice acting, and especially its animation.Brave is about a feisty carefree princess that is absolutely not ready for a suitor, and not ready for the lifestyle of a queen. After a nasty spat with her mom, she sets off and makes a drastic decision leading to a difficult series of events. Without spoiling too much, Brave offers plenty of twists to the usual rebel-against-the-parents story that we see in kids movies.The outstanding part of this movie is the animation, which is leagues above anything else the competitors can weave. From the backgrounds to the action sequences to the subtle clever visual jokes to the staggering details concerning Princess Merida's hair, Brave looks spellbindingly gorgeous. The voice acting was also superb, as plenty of emotion was delivered by Kelly McDonald, Billy Connolly, and Emma Thompson.What will make this princess-driven movie stand out is Merida herself. She has quite a personality that in sharp contrast to princesses in animated and live-action ranging from Snow White to Princess Fiona in later Shrek films. She is funny, caring, adventurous, and far stronger emotionally and physically then what we are used to seeing on screen. The shameful part is that on the latter half we don't see her adventurous qualities---she barely uses her bow and arrow that had been sprinkled all over the marketing (which is definitely the worst part of Brave and most likely will hinder its box office receipts).As a matter of fact its the latter half that prevents this from being something truly magical and special. We don't see the Braveness in Brave, we don't see Merida as much action but more in a preparedness pose, and ultimately the climax wraps around a bit too quickly. The changing of directors definitely had a profound effect on the pacing and direction of the movie.Have no fear however, the little kids will definitely enjoy Brave. There is still enough humor, heart, and suspense to propel this past your usual computer animated drivel. And the Pixar fanatics will just be thrilled that its a turn back to originality after experiencing sequel after sequel---- -----And Cars 2.",Brave
126,SumanShakya,Funny....,7,4 December 2013,"This time Walt Disney takes a comic approach mixed with some fairy tale and dramatic elements, and the result is quite an engaging and entertaining tale that keeps you glued as long as it lasts. The animation is much crisper and with the promos, the film looked very promising and elegant. Well, the film does carry some charm and might be liked by children; but the story is quite weak this time which meanders into some forgettable Disney movies of the past like ""Brother Bear."" The dialogues lack the punches of ""Tangled"" and ""Up."" But nevertheless, the film makes a joyous watch.

128,EthanBJones_03,Cautiously Recommend,6,10 September 2017,"'BRAVE' - 2012Directed by Brenda Chapman and Mark AndrewsStarring Kelly MacDonald, Emma Thompson and Billy ConnollyPlot Overview: Merida (Kelly Macdonald), the impetuous but courageous daughter of Scottish King Fergus (Billy Connolly) and Queen Elinor (Emma Thompson), is a skilled archer who wants to carve out her own path in life. Her defiance of an age-old tradition angers the Highland lords and leads to chaos in the kingdom. Merida seeks help from an eccentric witch (Julie Walters), who grants her an ill-fated wish. Now, Merida must discover the true meaning of courage and undo a beastly curse before it's too late.As much as I do like this movie, which I do, I will confess that is lacks the 'Pixar Touch' and if it didn't literally have the Pixar title emblazoned across it, I would have second guessed it as a Pixar film. While the building blocks are certainly there, it just feels like a half-baked Disney Princess movie and that is unfortunate. I can recommend this film with confidence, but I am not confident in guaranteeing your enjoyment of it. I would definitely see it but don't blame me if it disappoints you. Go in expecting a Disney Princess movie and not a Pixar movie, and you'll be at least satisfied.From what I can tell is that the general consensus of this film is as follows: first third is good, second third is okay and the final third is poor. I am not at all in agreement with that sentiment. I think that each third of this film are just as good as each other BUT I do think that they are all thirds of three separate movies. With the exception of character and animation style, judging purely based on content. I'd have though that this was three different films in one.I do wish that the ending was a little more bittersweet. I am not a fan of the ending and definitely think the film would have been improved IF they cut the climax by 30 seconds in which a major plot point occurs. Remove that point and I think the film is better as a whole. The theme and setting were both very interesting and creative choices so props for not being boring and bland.​ I like the story as a whole but it just feels more like Disney and not like Pixar. I know Pixar is a subsidiary of Disney but Toy Story is a PIXAR movie, Finding Nemo is a PIXAR movie, Up in a PIXAR movie. This feels like a classic Disney princess tale, which is fine, but not like the Pixar I love. I am sure this will be a turn off for most people which I can understand because it isn't Pixar but if you can look past that, it isn't a bad movie.Kelly MacDonald was the clear standout as Merida. ​Merida was a good Disney princess as a whole and I appreciate her entire goal being achieving independence. That said, I think she lacked a form of sincerity to make her great. Not being a cliché Disney princess was a great idea, but I still think she lacked a certain amount of precision in her character design which would make here more interesting to watch. Nitpicking aside, she was a pretty good character as a whole.Emma Thompson was good as Queen Elinor. I do admire her character arc and admire the sheer simplicity to it. She grows as a bearson and I definitely bought that.​ Mor'du in this movie is such an atrocious villain. We know next to nothing about him. He has nothing(literally) interesting to say. He isn't likable. He is a bland, boring, brash bear barking toward Merida and trying to attack; that is his entire character; truly awful stuff Pixar, truly awful.As for comedic sidekicks, this film has three. The witch, voiced by Julie Walters, was a critical plot point and entertaining in her short run on screen but I would have liked to know a little more about her. Billy Connoly's was good as King Fergus and I did like his character as a whole. The triplets were pretty funny and sourced a good portion of the film's good jokes.The animation for this film does look very nice and it is pleasing to look at. The costume and set design were both good and mirror the stereotypical perception of Scotland. Both the cinematography and editing were good. No real complaints on the technical side of the film.There is definitely humour in the movie but it basically boils down to Triplets, Fergus and Witch. Our lead wasn't that funny. Granted that wasn't her character but would it kill her to crack ONE joke. Be funny ONCE. I know I am nitpicking to the nth degree but still, one joke. Just one?There is definitely emotional payoff in this movie. I won't dispute that. What I will argue however is that there is no where near enough as there should be. This does loop back to my earlier point about a preference for a bitter sweet ending. I think that would pull at our heartstrings more and would have made the film so much better. As a whole, I was satisfied with Brave. It did disappoint me slightly but that is because it wasn't a PIXAR movie. It was entertaining for what it was but I cannot say that it grabbed me like other Pixar films do. Nothing about it, bar the setting, really stand out and it just blends into other Disney princess movies. I cautiously recommend you see the film however. I personally think it is worth a watch but I cannot guarantee you will like it. I'd rate 'Brave' 6 'Wee Rascals' out of 10.",Brave
129,kdnor2011,"One of Pixar's weaker films, but still very good",8,28 October 2012,"After the critical disappointment that was Cars 2, people started to trash Pixar. They seem to have put the company on such a high pedestal, that one movie that wasn't a masterpiece was a sign that the company is never going to make a great movie again. Well I do love Pixar, and have absolutely loved several of their films, there are some movies that I just consider pretty good films that aren't masterpieces. The two Cars movies, Ratatouille, most of Up, and A Bug's Life, most of these were very good movies, but didn't reach amazing standards. And Brave lands in that category as well.The major issue with this movie is the fact that the story is pretty cliché and very predictable. I knew exactly how the story would end half way through the movie. At times it feels like it's ripping off other movies like ""How to Train Your Dragon"" and ""Brother Bear."" The three little boys range from funny to kind of annoying. There's some juvenile humor, but all Pixar movies have that, they have some juvenile humor for the kids, and some jokes for the adults that will go over the kid's heads. And there was a little too much comedy, it often outweighs the dramatic stuff.Which is kind of ashame, because the parts where the movie slows down and has some drama are some of the best parts. I liked the relationship between Merida and her mother, it was how a teenage daughter and her mother would act, despite being a bit cliché. The way the plot gets moving is something that you will either go along with, or it will kill the movie for you. I didn't mind this, I actually kind of enjoyed the way it moved the plot along. It led to some funny moments, and even a few heartwarming moments. I was never bored in the movie, most of the jokes worked, and the climax was enjoyable. But the best part was the animation, the first few seconds when it's just landscape actually made me ask ""is that real?"" And the animation on Merida's hair is outstanding, just as good as Repunzel's in ""Tangled."" So while ""Brave"" is one of Pixar's weaker movies, it's still a good one. The plot is predictable, but it has some really good characters and great animation, plus some good humor and a fun fantasy element. It's a great family movie, I would put it one step above ""A Bug's Life"" and one step below ""Ratatouille,"" not really one I will watch over and over, but a good film that you and your children should enjoy.",Brave
130,cat_ranchero,Good!...,7,30 March 2013,"I first have to praise the animators at Pixar, the film really does look quite stunning, as we've come to expect. I will put aside the many historical inaccuracies or I could be here all day; needless to say, a lot of poetic license has been used. There were some really comic moments which I found quite refreshing, but the general narrative was skewed towards a female audience (I felt). Not that that's a bad thing; I still found myself wrapped up in the story as much as I would have been if it had been a more male orientated work. Over all, it's very enjoyable with some great comic moments.

131,HelenMary,beautifully drawn Celtic tale about finding your Fate; touching and funny,9,2 June 2013,"Disney and Pixar are always a good bet. The artwork and animation are second to none, and even from the opening scene of landscape, it's a visually stunning film. The human characters are all individual and the lip movement for the dialogue is well done. The plot is original and sweet, very funny and heartwarming. It's a lovely story and I love the Scottish backdrop and traditions. It's tense too with suspense and lots of action. The Highland Games were great and there's lots of physical comedy to enjoy. It has reminiscence of some of the older Disney's ie The Sword in the Stone and like other Disney films there's something for children and much that is definitely adult ie Maudie's bosom and the naked behinds of the clansmen when they've used their kilts as a rope to get down off the roof of the castle. Hilarious.The use of the Druidic standing stones in the story was beautiful and the soundtrack was lovely. Well researched film. Loved it. Like a lot of Disney/Pixar films it might not be suitable for very little ones as some of the scenes with the bears might be a little scary. There is a little scene after the credits so be sure and watch out for it. Perhaps I felt more drawn to it being of Scottish heritage myself, and bottom line it is a children's film, but I really enjoyed it.",Brave
132,kgprophet,Pixar Not a Level Above the Rest Anymore,6,1 July 2012,"As I was finishing watching the new Pixar movie, I was trying to figure out how the title ""Brave"" fit into the film. It wasn't clearcut, other than a final bit of narration. I understand the original title was ""The Princess and the Bear"", and that is a more appropriate title. About half the movie follows the shenanigans of the young redhead and said bear. Does it work? Sure, the bear is given human qualities, but still can evoke a sense of danger. In general the complaint seems to be that the arc of the story doesn't push the envelope, things that you expect to happen with the story pretty much happen as planned. I decided to watch this movie in 3D, because I heard that the lush visuals helped make up for the simple story. This was true, so my final verdict is thumbs up, but it still fails to live up to the competition. The competition I am talking about is the excellent ""How to Train Your Dragon"", released a couple years ago.HTTYD was a surprise hit, combining memorable characters with some good fairy tale dragons, as well as teenage rebellion, etc. ""Brave"" ventures into similar territory, and frankly didn't entertain me as much as HTTYD. I think another story layer was missing. I think also that this director was not at the level of sophistication as former Pixar director Brad Bird, for instance. I can't say there was any point where I got bored, or where a character became annoying. The crowd I was a part of in the theatre was full of kids, and they laughed at every pratfall. There were only sparse moments of adult level humor, certainly not enough to deem this a mature film in any way.One thing I thought was a bit of a letdown was the confines of the film's environment. The scenes in the forest break new ground in terms of texture and colour. Half-rotted tree trunks with a variety of shades of green moss create super-real visuals that benefited from the 3D effects. But most of the film takes place in your run-of-the-mill castle, including an extended action scene that feels like a video game where you chase around endless hallways and stairwells.There is certainly nothing to bemoan this latest CG animated film now seemingly lost in a glut of animation releases these days. We all know Pixar can do better, and I certainly won't declare that the Pixar magic effect has worn off. On the other hand, the usual captivating animated short that precedes all Pixar films was not all that as far as I was concerned. 3 men cleaning the moon was more simplistic than average and had a ho-hum payoff. For me, the fast-paced short that appeared before ""Wall-E"" called ""Presto"" is one of the best.Kids will be fine with this film, and adults will not get too bored, but all you really have left is the striking visuals (sometimes).",Brave
133,nickmesafilms,"Brave (2012) - If You Had to Change Your Fate, Would You?",6,17 November 2012,"Throughout Disney-PIXAR's 17-year history, this widely popular film studio has given us some of the most classic animated films, while at times, bringing some minor disappointments. Now, we are introduced to PIXAR's next movie, ""Brave"", which although is not a terrible movie by any means imaginable, is sadly PIXAR'S weakest film. ""Brave"" tells the story of a young Princess Merida, who wants to spend the rest of her life shooting arrows, riding horses, and finding her fate, rather than following the rules of her over-protective mother, whom obsessively teaches Merida on becoming a proper princess. After a rough confrontation between mother and daughter, Merida runs deep into the woods to find her fate. I know what you're wondering! You think that this is the start of an exciting adventure film, right? Nope! Instead, she finds her fate right in the middle of the movie, which is rather a potion that she gives to her mother, whom turns into a bear, and the whole movie is Merida trying to turn her mother human again! Yep, that's it. After a strong build-up, and an interesting first act, the movie sadly switches gears from a family-friendly adventure film, to a weird and sappy ""kids movie"". Although I can't really blame the film for purposely changing it's genre, I do blame the trailers for falsely advertising this movie, but either way, it wouldn't make the film better, though! The way this movie changed it's direction just became a major ""let-down"". But, not only that, the movie just feels way too cliché for the most part, using the same ""mother and daughter"" storyline over and over again, which although has a great message behind it, it felt way too recycled and repetitive, after having it used many times in the past. When the movie changes to a goofy kids movie, by having the mother turn into a bear, that is a complete fail on PIXAR's part. But it wasn't all that bad! The animation provided by PIXAR still looks gorgeous as always, the final act was portrayed very nicely, and we get some fine voice talents from Kelly MacDonald as Merida, Emma Thompson as the mother, and Billy Connoly in a scene-stealing voice role as Merida's father who seeks revenge on the bear who took his leg. But the film does have the same cliché story, the message has been used a thousand times before, and this does not have the same ""spark"" that I found in all of PIXAR's other timeless hits from ""Toy Story"" to ""Finding Nemo"".

134,Trevor-Kerensky,One of the better Pixar films,7,16 May 2018,"I remember seeing this movie back in 2012 and enjoying all the fantastic scenery as well as the Scottish themes. It's not the best animated film I've seen but it's a nice runner-up to my favorites. While watching the movie, I was reminded of two previous Disney films. One was Freaky Friday and the other was 1991's Beauty and the Beast (but no romance!). I don't remember too much about the film, considering I've only seen it once, but it's one of the less cliched Disney princess movies. Plus, the heroine is an archer with a brave heart (no pun intended towards the Mel Gibson movie). There are some darker themes in this Pixar outing so it might not be good for very young children, but it would be interesting for teens and twentyish adults, or anyone who wants to see a Scottish setting. This movie really broke tradition for Pixar. And it worked.",Brave
135,zeekwunlau,A little bit after feeling,7,8 April 2020,"When the incident began, Melida got a bow and arrow from her father as a king, but her mother as a queen did not agree with the gift from the king to Melida. She thought that Melida as a princess should be a lady. Here is the story It has buried the contradictions behind Melida and the queen. After receiving the gift from the king, Melida accidentally shot the arrow into the depths of the forest. Melida saw the whispering elf during the search for the arrow and led Melida to find the arrow and go home. Road, but after Melida saw the king and queen, they encountered a bear monster, and the bear monster was the main clue to the unfolding of the following story.As soon as the picture turned, a vast and rich coastal country appeared in our sight. The picture was very exquisite, showing us the beauty and strength of a country. A beautiful girl with curly red hair appeared in the picture, which was Melida when she grew up. From here, the story also shows us the contradiction between the queen and Melida. The queen hopes that her daughter should be a princess of a country. Be able to understand etiquette, speak without stage fright, behave decently, eat too much food, and learn skills should not be archery. But from Melida 's weapons and her resistance to the Queen 's preaching, she can be seen as a free-spirited girl who loves freedom and has some rebelliousness. She has her own ideas but lacks thoughtfulness. The queen is a representative of observance of etiquette, noble and elegant but also humorous. I like Queen Eleanor very much, thinking about her children, protecting them, and teaching Melida about life, but she also has many The common problem of adults is that they do not understand the child's resistance and rebellion. The way to deal with it is also lack of communication. Forcing my own love for the child but not thinking whether the child can understand the parent's I am for your good love. It is precisely because of this misunderstanding that the contradiction between Melida and the queen reached its peak after the queen arbitrarily recruited Melida. Melida was furious that the queen had laid down a route for her future without telling herself, but Melida still compromised with the queen and met the king and the queen who came to the kingdom. The eldest son brought by the lord. But Melida did not find her favorite person in the lord 's eldest son, so she defeated all the suitors in the archery competition in the back. Melida thought that she proved that she was more excellent than the suitors. You can refuse this recruitment, but the queen is angry about Melida 's behavior, and the princess of a country is angry at the impoliteness of the guests and beyond Melody 's behavior. When Melida thought her behavior was correct and the queen thought that her daughter had lost the princess style and did not give the guest a face, the conflict between the two broke out completely, and Melida cut the queen's office with a sword The embroidery of the family portrait, and the queen threw Melida 's favorite bow and arrow into the fire in her fright. Both the behavior of Melida and the queen deeply hurt each other, but there is a detail here, Melly Dar was unbelievable after seeing his bow and arrow burned, and fled the palace, and the queen regretted deeply after seeing her daughter running away, and quickly took out the bow and arrow burned by the fire. One is not to believe that she would treat me like this, and the other is not to believe that I actually did such a harm to her. Perhaps this is also the reason for the age and the role played.Melida met the whispering elf after leaving the palace, and led her to the witch's shop. In the witch's shop, Melida bought all the wood carvings with her necklace and exchanged a magic spell that could change the queen- A cake, another foreshadowing here, Melida did not hear the witch's attention. After returning to the palace, Melida saw her queen worried, and the queen told her that she could slow down the matter of recruiting and give Melida time to choose, but Melida did not change her mind when she heard the queen. Hou still decided to give the queen a cake. The queen thought that it was a good cake and ate it, but after feeling uncomfortable, she returned to the room and became a huge bear. Melida was frightened, but she found that this was her mother in order to find her mother to change On the way back, he took his mother to find the witch, but found that the witch had left, and if the queen had not changed back by the second sunrise, the curse would continue forever. Here Melida continued to use potions to contact the witch because she couldn't believe her mother would become a human, but when the house was blown up, the queen held Melida in her arms with the bear's body to protect her. In the following relationship, the queen gradually changed her original thoughts on Melida because she saw that Melida loved freedom and what she was good at and did not show that side to herself. Because of this change, Melida was able to tell her thoughts in front of the three lords. The lord also found that her eldest sons had the same ideas as the princess, and they wanted to pursue their true love and freedom. But when everything was better, people found the queen and mistakenly thought the queen was the bear monster who wanted to kill him. In the process of preventing the king and the lord, Melida appeared as a real bear monster. The queen stepped forward to fight the bear monster and saw it under the boulder when she saw the bear monster hurt her daughter. Because Melida repaired the embroidery and put it on the queen before coming out the next day, the queen was able to return to humanity.The ending ends with a happy reunion. The story is not so much about Melida 's bravery, but rather about the story where a mother and daughter 's conflict has been resolved, and the reason for their conflict is the lack of communication. After making mistakes, Melida worked hard to solve the mistakes she had made, and she did not escape when she was in danger. She tried to rescue her mother, and the queen stepped back to her after gradually learning the wishes of her daughter. For a mother 's love for her child, and for the mistakes made by the child, the queen is also tolerant after calming down. When facing her daughter, the queen also gradually let go of her own dignity and changed herself. Lida has to do everything she can, and she protects her without regard to danger when in danger. The name of the brave legend feels not that Melida is alone, but also the courage that Queen Eleanor is willing to change for Melida. The share of the two in the face of danger does not fade.",Brave
136,ragingbull_2005,Most boring animation of the year,5,1 November 2012,"This is a tale of two halves. The first half is about a princess who is rebellious in nature and questions the established traditions of her land. She loves archery. She has three cute as button brothers and they keep on raising hell. Suitors from three different lands arrive for her hand. This is what makes the first 35 minutes. This is the part I enjoyed the most. However, when she escapes from her palace and finds a witch, the movie goes on a downward spiral from which it never really recovers. The original director of the movie who also wrote the story, Brenda Chapman, was fired during the making of the movie. She was replaced by Mark Andrews and this shows very jarringly. The fun element goes missing and there were barely any comic moments thereafter.There are scenes showing mother daughter bonding designed to touch your heart. But they fall flat. The ending is the lamest I have seen in any Pixar movie(haven't seen the much criticized Cars 2). Overall I am disappointed with this because it fails to live up to the high Pixar standards and turns out to be a damp squib. 2.5 out of 5 for Brave. The title itself is misleading as there are hardly many instances when the princess shows her ""bravery"".",Brave
137,Chris_Pandolfi,Disney/Pixar's Return to Form,9,22 June 2012,"After taking a slight misstep last summer with the amusing but superficial ""Cars 2,"" the creative teams at Disney/Pixar have thoroughly redeemed themselves. ""Brave"" is an absolute joy – a seamless blend of spectacular animation, intelligent writing, and tremendous heart and imagination. Although its status as a 3D computer animated film modernizes it from a technical standpoint, its values are firmly rooted in the glory days of traditional cel animation, in which it was believed that adults and children should experience it together. Here is a story that doesn't mindlessly pander to younger audiences; it bothers to tell a story and develop the characters in such a way that parents will also feel engaged. It's funny without being condescending, frightening without being nightmarish, and touching without being sappy. It's a perfect emotional balancing act. It's also terrific entertainment.Taking place in Ancient Scotland and drawing from a deep well of Scottish folklore, the film tells the story of a teenage girl named Merida (voiced by Kelly Macdonald), a skilled archer and sword fighter distinguished by a full head of unkempt curly red hair. She's adventurous, athletic, and fiercely independent, qualities that go against the duties and expectations mandated by her royal upbringing. Her mother, the elegant Queen Elinor (voiced by Emma Thompson), has the best of intentions when it comes to her family and her kingdom, and she acts as a levelheaded counterpoint to her dedicated yet impulsive husband, King Fergus (voiced by Billy Connolly), a vast Highland warrior who will gladly regale anyone with the tale of how he lost his leg to the demon bear Mor'du. But Elinor can also be an unendurable nag, especially when it comes to her daughter and her unladylike demeanor.The lords of the neighboring three clans, who have each formed a shaky truce with King Fergus, convene at a medieval fair, where the eldest sons will compete in an archery contest for Merida's hand in marriage. This is in perfect accordance with age-old customs, but Merida, determined to be in control of her own fate, finds a loophole and uses it to rebel. In more ways than one, this creates a rift between mother and daughter, both of whom are too stubborn to see things from the other's point of view. Merida runs off into the forest and, after entering a gigantic circle of monolithic stones, follows a magic trail of will o' the wisps to the cottage of a witch (voiced by Juile Walters), an eccentric old crone who makes a living whittling out wooden trinkets. After initially denying her true self, she begrudgingly fashions for Merida a spell that will, as Merida requested, change her mother.This eventually leads to a turn of events that has mercifully not been given away in the ads. So as preserve the surprise, I will play along and not spoil it for you. What I will say is that Merida and Elinor are each a half of the film's emotional core; at its most fundamental level, it's about a mother and daughter learning to communicate and to appreciate each other for who they are instead of for who they want the other to be. This process of discovery is depicted with tremendous care, believably running the emotional gamut from pleasant to stormy. I suspect many adult audiences will be able to relate to this, especially if they now have teenage children of their own. Just as a child typically fails to understand the actions of a well-meaning parent, so too do parents often forget how fresh and uncomplicated the world seems to a child.All the Disney/Pixar films are exercises in creating worlds that completely immerse audiences. ""WALL-E"" transported us into outer space. ""Finding Nemo"" took us on an undersea expedition. ""Up"" had us soaring through the clouds. The ""Toy Story"" trilogy made the real world seem extra large. True to form, ""Brave"" follows in this tradition. The film is a visual triumph, evoking the natural beauty of the Scottish Highlands with painstaking detail. The water really seems to glisten. The leaves and grasses really look as if they sway in the breeze. At the same time, little touches of magic like the will o' the wisps give it the feel of an illustration in a beloved storybook. That none of this is diminished by the 3D process is nothing short of miraculous. If it looks this good with a slightly dimmed picture, imagine how good it will look in a noticeably brighter 2D projection.Most animated films are known for their colorful side characters, and this one is no exception. Apart from the witch, a refreshing retrofit of a conventional evil cackling hag, we have Merida's identical triplet brothers, a trio of mischievous and surprisingly resourceful dessert snatchers. We also have the three cantankerous clan lords (voiced by Kevin McKidd, Robbie Coltrane, and Craig Ferguson), whose comic relief status is matched only by their dimwitted sons (voiced by McKidd, Callum O'Neill, and Steven Cree). All six, along with King Fergus and a roomful of guests, take part in two sequences, both of which exemplify how it usually takes a woman to get things under control. The first is a hilarious brawl. The second is a near declaration of war. ""Brave"" is a not only another terrific Disney/Pixar offering, it's also a masterful animated film in and of itself.-- Chris Pandolfi (www.atatheaternearyou.net)",Brave
138,jose-cruz53,Mediocre Pixar,5,13 January 2013,"In the past Pixar has pushed the envelope in US animation, making more adult films than those of Disney and other studios. Thanks to their Ghibli inspiration, they managed to attain levels of artistic excellence lacking in other US animation studios. However, this cartoon is an exception: out of the Pixar films I have watched (including all their 1995-2012 films except Cars, 1 and 2), this was the weakest. Indeed, this is a quite weak film that will only please small children.It is also shorter than most Pixar films, at 80 minutes of actual film, short because children will not manage to watch longer films. Indeed, this is completely pedestrian and mediocre film that recycles all the tropes from previous Disney and Pixar films and packages them in a more beautiful CGI look than ever before.",Brave

140,Thrashman88,I expected more...,6,12 August 2012,"Brave is good family entertainment but compared to other Pixar movies I can only say it's below par. Why? Because at over 30 minutes into the movie I still had no idea what this movie was going to be about? Would Merida (the title character)grow to become some sort of heroine defending her people? Would she face some incredible enemy? The actual story and motivation behind Brave is more trivial. Sure, I had my laughs and my daughters seem to have enjoyed the movie, it's just that Brave ain't no ""Finding Nemo"", nor ""The Incredibles"". Neither it is a ""Toy Story"" or even ""Bugs"". It feels like an underdeveloped story and probably under the hands of a better writer it could've been a more memorable film. A case in point: Merida's bow and arrow. With all the publicity posters having her with her bow and arrow and then seeing her in the movie being a master in archery, this ability is never ever developed. Merida just looks ""good"" holding a bow and arrow, that's it!Don't get me wrong: I enjoyed Brave, but it seems Pixar has raised the bar to high even for their own good.",Brave
141,eshwarmail,"Lesser work from Pixar, but that does not make it a lesser of a movie",7,9 December 2012,"There is a certain likability and pleasantness within the first few minutes of the movie and the same neither elevates nor diminishes for the rest of the runtime. May not be on par with other greater Pixar works but still had enough juice to hold on its own. There are a lot of father-son, father-daughter bonding movies but hardly any mother-daughter ones at least as a central plot which adds to its freshness. Pixar's tried and tested and never out-of-fashion formula is applied to the full extent and it works great too.Merida (voice by Kelly Macdonald) is a first born daughter to the king of a warrior clan who is prepared her entire life by her mother (voice by Emma Thompson) to be a courteous princess. Merida's exposure and incredible skill with archery, adventurous mindset and a lack of heed for the customs and traditions leads her to go against her mother when the time comes to choose her a groom. She approaches a witch to change her mother in turn her fate which results in a serious complication. With time running out, she learns an important lesson that also changes the fate of their kingdom.There are a lot of inspirations drawn from other successful non-Pixar movies like 'How to train your Dragon', 'Shrek' and 'Madagascar' which is unlike Pixar as they have been the trend-setters of animation so far. The sweet Scottish accent used by most characters especially the mother-daughter duo works beautifully. The animation though wonderfully presented, does not have enough innovation. Pixar got its basics right as the movie is consistently funny and touching.Lesser work from Pixar, but that does not make it a lesser of a movie",Brave
142,squirrel_burst,"Good family entertainment, catch this one on mother's day for sure",8,14 December 2014,"""Brave"" has a lot of laughs, a touching story about the relationship between a girl and her mother and some interesting, well developed characters. The film looks great (the hair and clothes look better in this film than in any other computer generated movie) and it has a lot of subtle qualities that make it enjoyable. My favorite? The lack of a contrived love plot, something present in countless children's movies? When I was a kid, I didn't care about getting married and I know most of my friends didn't pay any attention the idea either, so why do so many children's films shoehorn in those love plots? I also liked that there are some jokes aimed more at the parents, without the movie using innuendo or other cheap ""adult"" gags so there's something for everyone here. It's not Pixar's strongest film, but it's better than most movies aimed at kids and you'll be hard pressed to find a family movie about a mother and a teenage daughter that will make you smile as much as this one.

143,Ryan_MYeah,"Brave represents a huge rebound for Pixar. Die-hard fans, prepare to be unsurprisingly amazed.",9,22 June 2012,"When thinking of the best animated movies, one's mind always flashes immediately to the Pixar filmography. Since 1995 with the first Toy Story, they've been charming audiences with wonderful movies like Finding Nemo, Up, and WALL·E (the latter being one of my all time favorite movies). And after a recent critical lashing to Pixar's previous Cars 2, and a year of waiting impatiently, I was given a chance to finally see their latest movie Brave.Consider me stunned, and unsurprisingly so! Breathe a sigh of relief fellow movie-goers. Brave is not only the year's absolute best movie so far, and Pixar's best movie since WALL·E, it's also the best animated movie in years.In ancient Scotland, Princess Merida, a skilled and tough as nails archer, grows tired of her daily life. Finding the age old customs enforced by her mother restricting, she decides to go against the traditions of her royal history, refusing to take a husband from the oldest son of one of three lords from other clans, causing controversy due to her series of actions. Seeking to change her fate, Merida receives a spell from a reclusive forest witch, but by doing this, unleashes a terrible ancient curse, and now must discover the true meaning of bravery, and make things right.As is expected of any Pixar movie, there is a strong investment to story, with plenty of spectacularly memorable characters, strongly developed and realized sub plots and arks, and a lot of great humor (only a few jokes briefly overstay their welcome). Another interesting element of the movie is the fascinating magical side to it. Co-writer and director Brenda Chapman based the story partly on her love of fairy tales by Hans Christian Anderson, and the wonderful fairy tale aspects of the movie work very well in the film's favor. Sure, it may not be Pixar's most original premise, but it still hits all the right marks.But beneath all that is also genuine emotion, and the most potent emotional element is the troubled relationship between Merida and her mother. Aside from fairy tale lore, Chapman also based most of the story on how she raised her own daughter, and the relationship between mother and daughter is one that evokes so much heart, made all the more better by the voice overs of the great cast, including Kelly MacDonald, Emma Thompson, and Billy Connolly. MacDonald and Thompson give so much in voicing Merida and her mother, and that makes the heart of this movie all the more special. I'll admit that by the time all was said and done, I was starting to cry.Lastly, it cannot be understated how much a thing of beauty Brave is. Dazzlingly designed and realized, the sweeping and jaw dropping animated Scottish environments are among some of the best production design I've ever seen for an animated movie. Not to mention how perfectly the characters are animated. From the fearless expressions of Merida, to the hideous and menacing bear Mor'Du, everyone is all as they should be. Brave is also a movie that sounds terrific, with a catchy and lovely Celtic score by Patrick Doyle (This is the best music in any Pixar movie since Finding Nemo), and detailed sound design from the great Gary Rydstrom.I cannot sing Brave's praises enough, and I'm already eager to watch it again! It's first movie of 2012 to receive the highest possible score I give out.***** / *****",Brave
144,nicolechan916,A mystical feel with great animation.,7,23 August 2014,"The trailer actually does an excellent job of not giving the real plot line away. I was pleasantly surprised when I watched this and found it was not what I expected.The animation was really good, it set the atmosphere and was consistent throughout. However, I did not like the fact that the girls (Merida and the Queen) had to be so skinny while the men (especially the King) had to be huge. I guess during that time it was normal, but the contrast was too obvious, and just causes to strengthen gender stereotypes in children. What's the point of having the female protagonist rebel against tradition when she still has a stick figure that would get the little girls watching self conscious later on?I guess I'll have to complain on that point for just about every animation movie I watch. I don't think I've seen one without that body figure stereotype. If it's not the men being huge, then they're at least (almost) the same size as the women -- unrealistically skinny.Moving on, I originally thought Brave was about the princess going out and shooting arrows, and though she did, the movie wasn't entirely focused on it. I would have liked to see her shoot some more or maybe scenes of her learning to shoot.I did like the addition of the three brothers who added a comedic effect and were quite adorable. The film itself was well written and edited, which kept me interested along the way.Read more reviews at championangels.wordpress.com.",Brave
145,Stompgal_87,Pixar's first fairy tale is a winner!,9,25 January 2014,"I love Pixar films, especially the Toy Story franchise. Like WALL-E, this is another Pixar film I never got to see at the cinema but saw for the first time upon renting the DVD. I didn't watch this the whole way through first time around due to a faulty disc but when I reported it, LoveFilm sent me a replacement that played with no trouble throughout. The second viewing made this film thoroughly enjoyable.The concept of this film being set in Scotland is unique for Pixar. The Scottish accents from Emma Thompson and Julie Walters are spot-on and Kelly MacDonald (who I remember vaguely as Evangeline in Nanny McPhee) was perfect as the headstrong Merida - likewise with Billy Connoly as Fergus. I loved the authentic musical score by Patrick Doyle while the songs by Julie Fowlis and Birdy with Mumford and Sons were lovely. The backgrounds were gorgeously and realistically rendered while some of the character designs were reminiscent of those used in The Incredibles (especially Merida and Elinor) but in a good way. Merida is beautiful with distinctive curly red hair and her triplet brothers are cute and comical. The animation is up to Pixar's usual standards - I especially liked Merida's effective archery scene that I remember seeing in an advert for this film.The story stands out from all the others that Pixar used and it had some clever and amusing parts such as Elinor talking to Fergus when he was pretending to be Merida while Merida was cleaning Angus's stable (that scene's intelligent editing made it look as if Elinor and Merida were actually talking to each other), a male character mooning (albeit his bottom not being Shown on screen) whilst saying, "" Feast your eyes!"" and the hologram of the witch floating above the cauldron acting as an automated telephone message. There are also some emotionally intense and dark moments in the story such as Merida and Elinor not seeing eye-to-eye with each other and Elinor turning into a bear. My only complaint is that the story was complicated in parts but it still had some standout moments.Overall, this is a highly entertaining and authentically-produced Pixar film that was more enjoyable the whole way through. 9/10.",Brave
146,martinrobertson300482,Och aye the noo!,4,15 August 2012,"""Brave"" is pixars most un-ambitious film yet. Maybe after their long string off great movies the studio feel they no longer need to try. I (like most) have come to expect a lot from Pixars CGI animations, and (like most) was thoroughly disappointed with this one.I Suppose it doesn't help that I'm Scottish and found a majority off the films inevitable stereotypes way too overly familiar. I even had a bet with the friend I went to see the movie with, over how long it would take too see them all eating Haggis. And there the scene was, a mere 10 minutes in. Not that I found ""Brave"" overly offensive, it just totally lacked the imagination off many off Pixars other movies, and replaced it with everything you've already seen before in a Hollywood movie set in Scotland.This is not the only part off ""Brave"" that is lacking however. The story is also uninspired there's a lack off action, and the films attempts to be funny fall flat as often as they succeed. Ye, the animation is good (They seem to be loving the fact the main character has a mass off red curly bouncy hair) you'll maybe get some laughs out off this flick, and the ending will no doubt have some off the audience emotional. But by then it was too late for me.",Brave
147,illbebackreviews,"Not as good as other Pixar Classics, but still good...",6,12 November 2012,"I finally had the chance to sit back and watch Brave, after watching several reviews on the internet and hearing the criticism that this film has been getting... I began watching it with a negative frame of mind but a few minutes into the film I started to love it. It felt so much like the Shire sequences at the start of Fellowship of the Ring. I was surprised how the film obviously borrowed bits from LOTR. The film was brilliant at the start....Slowly, the film began to lose its magic and the film suddenly felt more childish than it was supposed to be. There weren't very many laughs at all, and the plot was both cheesy and un- original. The ending of the film was happy and the film remained decentThe biggest positive about this film is the amazing AMAZING computerized environments. The animation looks absolutely magnificent. If anything, this film deserves the Oscar for ""Best Animation"" The voice acting was brilliant and there were a few lovable characters...The dad and Merida's little brothers. One big problem with this film, apart from the plot, is the character of Merida. I found her mainly annoying and such a brat, but the character generally got better towards the end.There were a few laughable scenes and the start was brilliant feeling lot like Lord of the Rings and the Hunger Games.

148,ghost_dog86,Go Feminism!,7,12 July 2012,"Thank God ""Brave"" isn't as historically serious (and/or boring) as the trailers made it out to be. Directed by Brenda Chapman, who was then fired and replaced by Mark Andrews (probably for the better) ""Brave"" is the much anticipated new animated feature film from the geniuses at Pixar centered around the story of a young Scottish princess. With mind-blowing animation and a simplistic but highly entertaining storyline, after the whole ""Cars 2"" fiasco, ""Brave"" will undoubtedly spell a return to form for the Lebron James of animation that is Pixar Studios. And when I say mind-blowing animation, the hair speaks for itself.With a storyline that should not be solely considered non-abrasive cartoon feminism at its best, but a touching mother/daughter tale as well, ""Brave"" tells the story of Princess Merida, a Scottish princess with fiery red hair, who is skilled in archery, horseback riding and stubbornness. When her mother informs her that there is to be a competition taking place where young men from neighboring families will fight for Merida's hand in marriage, this progressive adolescent princess will have none of it. Determined to thwart her mother's wishes, Princess Merida sets out into the enchanted woods to find the one ""magical thing"" (that's what you call foreshadowing) which will make her mother change her mind and in turn change Merida's own fate. Yes, this type of heroine may draw comparisons to Disney princesses of the past, but with a more tomboyish adventurous spirit (rivaling a female action character such as ""Mulan"").With a super simplistic storyline, in comparison to other Pixar films, ""Brave"" is front loaded with very welcome and marvelously constructed slapstick comedy and very colorful supporting characters which makes up for a second half slump. But before I get to the issues pertaining to the almost irrational plot twist the second half of the film takes, allow me to praise the work in the first half. From the characters, especially Merida and her three toddler aged brothers, who steal the show, providing audiences with a multitude of laugh out loud moments (seriously, they are as rambunctiously endearing as the fat kid from ""Up"") to the slapstick driven storyline of the three hilariously awkward suitors, the first 45 minutes of ""Brave"" are almost perfect. It is when other, more fantastical characters, whose magical circumstances are not very well thought out, arise in the latter half of the film that the movies as a whole takes a bit of a nosedive; that is to say many audiences (young and old) will be finding themselves waiting for the next laugh. With that said, the first half is so strong, that the latter, more eventful but far less engaging, half can be forgiven and even forgotten.Final Thought: Again, when compared to other Pixar gems, excluding the snoozer that was ""Cars 2"" (boy, I hated that movie) ""Brave"" doesn't really stand out (primarily for lack of storyline complexity). But on its own merits ""Brave"" is not only a film worth paying 10+ dollars to see, but is sure to be a front runner for Best Animated Feature Film come Oscar season. Plus, this is Disney's second attempt in only a short while (I am referring to ""The Princess and the Frog"") at playing the culturally aware card, by using the Scottish born voice-work of Kelly MacDonald, Billy Connolly and Emma Thompson...and that should count for something if you look at Disney's culturally insensitive past.",Brave

This relation can be ambivalent, even if love is always at the bottom of it - and this is depicted in the movie with warmth and understanding. When the queen reminded the princess of all she had tried to teach her during her upbringing, my daughter sighed artificially, and said: ""just like you, mum!"" :-) It makes you think, doesn't it..! :-) I loved the clear, colourful, beautiful pictures, the admirable and lovable characters, the Scottish/Celtic setting, the bagpipe music, the humour and magic..! There are two things that the movie-makers should have changed, though, in my opinion: 1) there are too many mistakes in history and geography (these are already listed in the ""goofs"" section, so I do not have to point them out). A big company like Disney, ought to be able to afford an employee who methodically checks all the facts; such as what foreign armies did invade a certain country at a certain point, and what animals did exist at this place in this period of time... These omissions detract from the overall impression of the movie 2) I think the common pop songs destroy something of the atmosphere. I wish they could have gone all in for more Scottish/Celtic music. This music also carry magic in itself... Why dilute it all with what we in Sweden call ""day-nursery pop music""..?",Brave

152,gregeichelberger,"Well, at least it was better than 'Cars 2' ...",4,21 June 2012,"Back-to-back duds from Pixar? What's next — the Apocalypse? The writing was on the wall, however, when the opening short, ""La Luna,"" (about two men and a little boy shoveling little stars on the moon) — so long one of my favorite ingredients of this studio — comes across as overly artsy and not at all entertaining.That is nothing compared to their latest feature, Brave, though. It's ""Braveheart"" meets ""Jack Frost"" (not the Michael Keaton movie, but the 1965 Finno-Soviet production about witches, bears and magic spells) and it is neither interesting nor particularly entertaining but instead clunky and confusing (and boasts one of the more ridiculous conclusions in recent memory).However, this tale of dark forests, foreboding lochs and mystical pagan symbols weaved around the tale of a teenage princess coming of age in a man's world is certainly nowhere near as dismal as ""Cars 2."" It's medieval Scotland and the land is ruled by the inept King Fergus (voice of Billy Connolly, ""Mrs. Brown"") and prim and practical Queen Elinor (Emma Thompson, ""Men in Black 3""). They have three precocious red-haired triplet boys and a rebellious teenage daughter, Merida (Kelly Macdonald, ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2"").Merida, having reached the age of marriage (whatever THAT was in medieval Scotland), is forced to watch as a series of goof-balls vie for her hand. She objects to this ritual, but her mother the Queen insists on what amounts to a public humiliation of her daughter.This, predictably, creates a rift between mother and daughter, and Merida is soon running off, following a line of will-o-the-wisps straight to an evil, woodcarving witch.Up until this point, ""Brave"" is beautiful. The lush colors of the Scottish highland landscape are captivating; the ethereal and beguiling blue-lit will-o-the-wisps are entrancing; the tale of the girl's dilemma is intriguing and the cute hi-jinx of the three little boys is delightful.But once Merida, still angry over her perceived mistreatment, has a spell cast transforming her mother into a bruin, the film slows to an uncomfortable crawl (until the final showdown) and gets much too dark — especially for children expecting something entirely different.Learning the true impact of the curse, Merida works feverishly to undo what she's done. This leads to several pursuits including one that has her making a rousing ""Braveheart"" speech to stop a war between kingdoms.The final battle, however, is quite the spectacle. Not necessarily in a good way though, as it takes place mostly in the black of night with frightening cruelty. In fact, I have not seen two animated bears battle it out like this since ""The Golden Compass"" (another profoundly bad picture).The action is also further muddled with the unnecessary use of 3D technology. (Come to think of it, the 3D effects are more of a bane than a boost to the entire movie).At least the voice talents of Connolly, Macdonald and others are authentic to the region and fit nicely with their respective characters. Although that isn't much of a stretch here.So, sprouting from a long line of classic animated films such as ""Finding Nemo,"" ""Wall-E,"" ""The Incredibles,"" ""Monsters, Inc."" and ""Up,"" among others, ""Brave"" proves once again the creators of these former masterpieces are indeed fallible and vincible.And that is a very sad reality indeed.",Brave
153,Bruce722,Good but not great.,7,23 June 2012,"I thought Brave was a very good and enjoyable family movie, but it didn't quite live up to it's Pixar brethren. For one, it felt incredibly short. I know the time listing says 93 minutes but I honestly doubt it was much more than 80 minutes. I have a feeling that ""93"" number is including the short film that preceded Brave called ""La Luna"". That was probably 5-10 minutes so that would seem more accurate. Also, the previews didn't do a very good job at representing the movie. The previews made it seem like the protagonist, Merida, would become overwhelmed and then run away from home. During this adventure, she would ""find herself"" by overcoming various obstacles during the course of the film. While this was partly true, the ""adventure"" lasted about 5 minutes and didn't lead her to any form of self discovery. Instead, she ended up back home and the path the movie took from here wasn't all that entertaining. The movie looked incredible and the voice acting was great but the plot just didn't unfold in the way I thought it should've. Still, this was a very good movie that the whole family can enjoy.",Brave
154,paudie,Mother and daughter animation movie,7,17 August 2012,"This Pixar animated movie focuses on a sometimes-fraught relationship between a teenage daughter and her mothers.Set in Scotland in ""olden times"" we meet Princess Merida, who loves nothing better than riding her horse and practicing her archery. However her mother, Queen Elinor, feels she should be more ladylike, especially since she intends to marry her daughter off to one of the sons of the local clan lords for political reasons. Merida is not pleased with this at all and there is a big argument. After meeting a witch Merida asks for a spell to ""change"" her mother. Of course this doesn't go as she expects and the action really begins.Unlike most animation movies the plot takes a few twists I didn't expect. As with all Pixar movies the animation is of the highest quality. The makers are obviously very proud of the job they did on creating Merida's red curly hair as it literally shines out from almost every scene! There are familiar voices doing the main roles, such as Kelly MacDonald, Billy Connolly and Emma Thompson.A very enjoyable movie for both young and old",Brave
155,FairlyAnonymous,A flawed but visually appealing movie,7,7 December 2012,"Brave is a beautifully animated movie. It truly looks amazing and the amount of detail in certain scenes is astounding. I haven't scene this much detail since Rango. And this is the movie's strong point. It looks good. Honestly I feel like the whole point of this movie was for Pixar to just share a little bit of their talented visuals. So I have established that the movie looks great. Now how about the rest of the movie? Well... it's OK. Nothing really special.The plot is actually surprisingly predictable, straight forward, and unoriginal. Pretty much I would call it Brother Bear meets elements of Shrek 2. The Witch also looks shockingly similar to the witch from Spirited Away. Basically the plot revolves around a heroine who wants to change her fate from getting a forced marriage. Like so many other princess movies (there are a lot of them with this plot) she doesn't want to get married and wants a life of adventure and fun so she gets a spell to change her fate... which ends up turning her mom into a bear. That's as much as I will tell you though one thing that surprised me is how very little Mor'du has to do with the plot (he is the giant black bear). His real purpose is just to explain why people are scared of bears. That's it. He has a little back story but it's only trivial and unimportant to the plot.If there is another thing I can compliment this movie on its that even though it is cliché, predictable, and unoriginal... it does a good job. A movie doesn't have to be original to be good and this movie proves that statement. The movie still has good enough characters, good dialogue, and is visually impressive enough to be good regardless of its generic plot. On a side note this movie has surprising amount of nudity jokes for a Pixar/Disney production. I mean that's not saying much and it's not terrible or anything but just a side-note.So I would suggest seeing the movie. Is it a Pixar classic like Finding Nemo or The Incredibles? No. Certainly not. But is it better than your average animated movie or Car 2? Yes it is. So try and enjoy and don't have your expectations set too high.",Brave
156,manendra-lodhi,"""Sugar coated with good animation but nothing refreshing.""",5,11 November 2012,"The biggest letdown was the story, centered on a very few characters and most of them shown foolish. The story revolves around a princess who doesn't like traditions. She does not want to be married to anyone who she doesn't know. While the film has an awesome animation, it can impress only the kids, just like the Madagascar series.PROS: The animation of Merida, the girl was particularly great and her hairs will be something to be remembered forever. It was good to see a women centered film. But the story couldn't go to some exciting ends. It is also a relief to see a film devoid of a boy-girl love story. The major focus was the relationship between the mother and the child. Considering that, the purpose was fully served, however it gets dull in some time and we need some different exciting twists in the film.CONS: Most of the times there were steep changes in the emotions and it's difficult to get linked up with them. One time you are dancing, playing and the other moment you are sad and worried. There was no proper buildup of the emotions. The film is coated with forced laughter without any genuine weight in them. The men were shown bumbling fools and it felt as if they were made to look like that, so that the women automatically look sensible and powerful.MESSAGE: ""Everyone has a destiny."" VERDICT: ""Watch at your own risk.""",Brave
157,TheMovieMark,"The ""Pixar magic"" is, much like Tom Cruise's sanity, lacking.",6,22 June 2012,"Visually stunning, but substantially lacking, Brave checks in near the bottom of my favorite Pixar movies list, right next to Ratatouille. Sure, the cinematography is beautiful and the effects are top-notch. But this is Pixar. I don't expect anything less. There are simply some parts of the job that you should always do well. Don't fix me a beautifully garnished barbecue platter and then expect a pat on the back when it turns out the plate actually has very little barbecue on it. Brave contains several nice elements, but the ""Pixar magic"" is, much like Tom Cruise's sanity, lacking.A lot of my disappointment hinges on the film's inability to meet my expectations, and that fault rests on the shoulders of the marketing department. Whoever put together the trailer needs a lesson on ""false advertisement."" After I initially saw the trailer for Brave I thought, ""Cool. Looks like Pixar is taking the concept of Braveheart, animating it, creating a female protagonist, and making it fun for the whole family. I'm on board! They'll never take OUR FREEDOM!"" Unfortunately, the film takes a weird turn about halfway through and puts its own twist on the ol' ""mother and daughter trying to repair their relationship"" dynamic. Now before you skewer me and throw me on the grill, please keep in mind that I did enjoy the film. I just never could get excited about it. It starts off slowly, delivers a twist I neither expected nor wanted, and fails to deliver the charm we've come to expect from films such as Toy Story, The Incredibles, Cars, etc. It's a prime example of a one-and-doner – once you've seen it, there really isn't much to warrant an encore viewing.And one warning to parents – there are quite a few moments that will be too scary and intense for the wee ones. If there is a chance that storms, witches, darkness, and bears trying to maul children could frighten your child then you might want to think twice before taking them to see this. At least a couple of kids started crying at the screening I attended, and one other asked her mom to let her leave the theater.Anyway, I know good and well that reviewing a Pixar film is about as pointless as carving Jell-O with a Ginsu knife. I could tell you it was the movie equivalent of a shirtless Michael Moore and you'd still go see it. So be it. Thus are the limitations of my influence.",Brave
158,GirishGowda,Straightforward Entertainment,8,9 November 2013,"Set in Scotland in a rugged and mythical time, ""Brave"" tells the tale of a young princess named Merida of the clan Dunbroch. One day she is given a longbow by her father, King Fergus, for her birthday, to her mother Queen Elinor's dismay. While practicing, Merida ventures into the woods to fetch a stray arrow, where she encounters a will-o'-the-wisp. Soon afterwards, Mor'du, a giant demon-bear, attacks the family. Merida escapes on horseback with Elinor, while Fergus fights off the bear at the cost of his left leg. Years later, Merida is now a free-spirited, headstrong girl with much younger identical triplet brothers. Elinor informs her that she is to be betrothed to one of her father's allied clans. Reminding Merida of a legend about a prince who had ruined his own kingdom by pride and refusal to follow his father's wishes, Elinor warns her that failure to consent to the marriage could harm Dunbroch, but Merida is still dissatisfied with the arrangement.Brave starts out quite enchantingly and has wonderful animation and music. We have a mother and daughter relationship that's going through a rough patch with both involved having to learn to respect each other's point of views and 'mend the bond' between themselves. In the beginning, it had the magic that most Pixar movies have, but somewhere after the first act there was a jarring transition into mediocrity when compared to other Pixar works. It lost its ambition and went into a straightforward clichéd storytelling without any scope for it to be enchanting or intelligent. That isn't necessarily a bad thing, but I did have high hopes. I didn't know about one director leaving due to creative differences and another one replacing her beforehand. I think the good stuff was done by the first director while the second one just added more action into it while some of the story elements were taken away to make way for plot devices. A shame really. The movie has lots of mixed messages and doesn't have a proper direction. That said, at the end of the day, its a fun and entertaining mother-daughter bonding movie.7.5/10",Brave
159,JaydoDre,Overestimated a bit but solid,6,9 February 2013,"Let us get it out of the way first: the animation looks awesome. The atmosphere, the design, the movements - it all looks great and it is a shame we do not see more of it.The characters are also great at their base value - distinct, likable and cute.A good foundation has been set However, the hype for Brave actually seems to have carried it higher then it would have flown otherwise, on its own wings.In true 21st century fashion, the story concentrates around a teenager girl who is rebellious and stronger than her society sees her or wants her to be. Several chieftains' sons compete in a tournament with her marriage as prise but, as the trailers showed you, she enters the tournament to compete for her own hand. You know what, let us just write ""feminist"" on her back, put her in pants and call it a day.Without giving too much away, the rest of the story is bland and cliché, or rather a combination of clichés. It's not entirely predictable, but just because you mix the clichés up doesn't mean that the product is going to be original, people! Having said that, the reason why Brave is not predictable is also not positive: it tends to have a problem with the flow. Like a malfunctioning gearbox it switches to strange gears at wrong times. I also did not like the logic that the film imposes on the viewer, especially in its ending, which feels rushed, as if the producer came into the room of the developers and said ""Ok that's enough messing around, finish it off now!"" and so they did.The bottom line: while the animation and characters are good, the story is bland, strange and comes off as preachy without having a message to preach. Having seen it some time ago, I cannot remember much about Brave beyond its pretty colors. There is nothing strikingly bad about it so what it is is average.",Brave

While ""Brave"" still maintains some of the legendary Pixar vitality, it is also an example of how Pixar has started to become worn around the edges...The movie still makes for a fun family viewing, with plenty for the adults sprinkled in there to keep the level of laughs quite high. Yet something is missing from this movie, which feels a lot more formulaic and restrained, something Pixar movies were never known for. ""UP"" was indeed Pixar's last minor masterpiece.It will be interesting what the future holds for the studio and its increasingly troubled relationship with Disney.I would recommend ""Brave"" as a movie, but with the caveat that hopefully Pixar's future projects re-gain their once almost expected quality.

Although being no fan myself of this family genre of films, only a few seem to capture my interest, I still look for great storytelling and found the storyline in this flick completely dull although i do have to say anything Scottish always keeps me somewhat entertained.

164,merrywood,The good and the not so good of Brave.,8,28 June 2012,"Without one iota of exaggeration, this new Pixar production, Disney release, is visually stunning. It has artful, clearly defined characters that loom off the screen, literally and especially so, in 3D. Some of the scenic movement is reminiscent of the great Ratatouille of a few years ago. That is saying a lot.To its credit, Brave depicts a young woman who fights for the right to live out her own life. However, that did not quite snatch the gold ring for me. It was just not enough substance. The production budget on this animated film was $185 million. In decades past, the shallow, somewhat sluggish script, seen here, would never have obtained a green light. It was difficult to watch all of the superb, brilliant artistry (actor voices included) and production values, design elements, wasted on that flat, empty script.Real literature, with its varied levels of meaning, and the old, sage, scenarist's secret, best embodied by the works of Frank Capra, Gene Roddenberry and Rod Serling, the ""Spiritual Payoff"" is now absent from the big screen. Take note how their works have survived through the decades.Most of today's studio suits do not appear to be aware that films structured at that level have the best word of mouth and the best legs. Today, they aim only at the child mentality where Walt Disney aimed at the widest audiences. His Pinocchio, for example, is still vital today. Indeed, some of its music has become the signature Walt Disney logo theme. That said, one blessing in current animated feature films, they no longer break continuity for Broadway type song and dance numbers, tedious nonsense that clung on to animated features like a giant fungus, for decades.Is it very difficult to come up with a soul for these scripts? I think not. In Pinocchio, for example, the log line is simple: A wooden puppet earns the right to his most ardent wish, to become a real boy.",Brave
165,jaxbubba,"A quaint film, not a great film!!!!!",6,24 June 2012,"Although this is being touted as a PIXAR movie release, it's the first Pixar release to have a very Disney-esque quality. The story of a young princess, not happy with the ""life"" path laid out before her, asks for help from a wicked witch to ""change"" her mother. Merida (Kelly MacDonald) is a strong willed, defiant individual who is in a constant struggle/battle with her mother, Queen Elinor (Emma Thompson). Queen Elinor is determined to groom the young princess into a proper heir to the throne. But more importantly, Queen Elinor wishes to re-unite the four independent Scottish clans back together again, by offering Princess Merida's hand in marriage to one of the eldest sons of the (3) other clans. Upon hearing this news, Princess Merida flees the castle, and heads into the forest. While in the forest, Merida meets a crafty witch. Merida barters her necklace for a magical potion that is supposed to ""change"" her mother's attitude/feelings with regards to Merida's pending nuptials. However, Merida was not that specific with her request to the witch, and got a potion that indeed changed her mother, but as they say, ""Be careful what you wish for""!!!!! The potion changed Queen Elinor into a grizzly bear. Merida now has less than 48 hours in order to break the spell. To do so, Merida must ""mend the bond torn by pride"" or have her mother remain a bear forever.As stated above, this story line is very Disney in nature, while the artwork is very reminiscent of ""How to Train your Dragon"". I found nothing new, exciting, or original in this Scottish tale. Except for the part of Queen Elinor being changed into a bear. that really came out of left field, and was truly unexpected!!! However, there is nothing ""not"" to like in this film either. It's your typical fairy tale, where lessons are learned, forgiveness granted, and in the end everyone lives ""Happily Ever After"".A moderate recommendation, I myself, would wait for the DVD, or watch this film ""On Demand"".

166,C22Man,A very average effort from Pixar,5,22 January 2016,"Pixar isn't known for its films falling into the 'average' category. All of their films are extremely inventive and feel genuine, excluding the lacklustre Cars and its weak sequel. However, Brave is a distinctly middle of the road effort from Pixar and one that lacks their usual innovative spark. For all its imaginative animation and varied comedic moments, you can't help but feel that something is missing when taking in the film as a whole. Set in mythical Scotland, the adventurous Princess Merida is told that she must marry despite her grievances. She defies her mother's wishes, receiving a potion from a witch and their relationship is tested in an unexpected way when the mother is turned into a bear. The film originally looked like it was going to tackle the challenges that Merida must face, but it becomes more of a film about the connection between a mother and daughter.Now this could be fine if it's done well, but two of the films biggest issues lie in the story. Firstly, the story is very predictable. From the very beginning of the conflict you know what's going to happen and that they'll be an obvious resolution at end, which is never properly explained anyway. Secondly, Merida has no arch and she doesn't change as the film progresses. She starts out free-spirited and irresponsible then she ends up being exactly the same way at the conclusion. She doesn't learn or develop despite what takes place between her and Elinor, in fact I'd argue that Elinor has a lot more growth as a result. Merida also isn't an enjoyable character because she is far too whiny and uninteresting to ever be truly invested in. She just comes across as an insensitive teenager, she isn't funny or smart and she isn't nearly as courageous as she's built up to be.With that said I did like the other characters. Elinor remains very dignified and likable despite all that she is put through. Fergus is an enjoyable king and gets plenty of laughs for his energetic behaviour, while having Billy Connolly voice him was smart idea. The Witch is more of a modern, fast-talker and she is amusing despite her limited appearance in all fairness. The three lords are all colourful and great fun, creating an entertaining sense of rivalry and providing most of the laughs. As a matter of fact the film does have a good sense of humour which is one of its strong points. The comedy is well varied, the slapstick is very well done and the majority of the jokes are at least amusing. Going back to the story, one thing that was good about it was the mother's mind becoming more bear-like over time, which was a nice twist and kept a tension that was badly needed.The animation is very impressive once again. It's always nice to see Pixar tackle different places and medieval Scotland was a smart choice. A real sense of wonder and majesty was crafted simply from the visuals alone, the landscapes look beautiful and even the designs on the characters (such as Merida's distinctive hair) are so detailed. The Scottish folklore was really enjoyable and created a strong atmosphere which makes it such a shame so little of it was used because certainly it would have made things much more interesting had it been developed. Patrick Doyle deserves credit for his distinctive score, it carries that Celtic sound thanks to the strong use of bagpipes but it also has many gripping melodies and does create a good backdrop for the images. In contrast, there is a lack of emotional connection throughout the film and that's something Pixar usually excels at. I found myself not caring about any of the characters or where the film was going to end up, which turned it into a dull experience at times and especially during the middle section.So for all of Brave's great technical aspects, it is let down where it truly matters with its story and main character. The story is so by-the-book and predictable that it's so difficult to be engaged by the journey it undertakes, it takes no risks and pushes no boundaries. It doesn't help when you have a dull lead because Merida is very boring to follow and as said she doesn't grow as a character. The film does have positives because the side characters, animation and score are all very good. Yet because this is from a studio as talented as Pixar we're always going to expect something great because they're fully capable of producing it. In a way it's disappointing more than anything else because the film did have so much potential and it will simply go down as a noticeably ordinary Pixar effort.",Brave
167,cadillac20,Another Great Pixar Film,8,22 June 2012,"Brave is a film I've been looking forward to since I first laid eyes on it's beautiful trailer. It had everything a great Pixar film has: a wonderful setting, fantastic CGI, beautiful and interesting characters, and a lot of heart. In fact, Merida alone was such an interesting and adorable character, that it was instantly on my to watch list. Granted, this isn't Pixar's best, but that's holding it up to extremely high standards. As an animated film, however, this is a fantastic and fascinating film, a treat for the summer.Brave tells the story of the aforementioned Merida, a young, Scottish princess whose life is controlled by her mother so that she can be shaped into a queen someday over the surrounding tribes. In an effort to change her fate and be free of her oppressive, but loving mother, she attempts to change her fate, and in the process makes a huge mistake. I won't get into plot details, as the trailer really doesn't give a lot away in terms of what this film is really about, but suffice to say, there is plenty of fun and adventure to be had.Pixar always manages to create an interesting and unique tale, and this goes right up there with the best of them. Using the Scottish highlands is both an inspiring choice and allows them to craft a beautiful film. With sweeping mountains, water, and thick and colorful forests, this is one of Pixar's best looking films to date. It trumps the jungles of UP and even the magical underwater world of Finding Nemo. There is a certain amount of magic in the environments alone, and gazing on it is a wonder. The characters are also fantastic. Merida is a wonderful addition to Disney's princess lineup, and unlike those others, she is no damsel in distress. She, like her mother, is perfectly capable of handling herself, with her trusty archery skills and even tackles a few dangerous situations on her own instead of having someone there to save her. In fact, this could be seen as an inverse, as Merida actually becomes a hero in many ways and triumphs over the males in her own age bracket. Also of note is Billy Connolly, voicing Fergus, who lends his comedic chops to create a wonderful and likable character.While this film may not be up there with Pixar's best, it still has a wonderful story and character interaction. Merida's relationship with her family feels genuine and most children will probably be able to relate. At the heart of the story is her relationship with her mother. This is more than a story about fate, but a story about obligations to family and how growing up means taking responsibility and putting away childish selfishness in place of those responsibilities. Although the core plot is unconventional and unexpected, it has a fantastic heart and once again proves that Pixar can tell a story like no other.Brave is an entertaining, humorous, and heartfelt story that will be wonderful for kids and adults alike. Merida is a wonderful new character and the entire film looks beautiful. Even if you don't have children, I recommend this film if you've loved other Pixar's before it.",Brave

170,Genti23,Just as good as ever.,9,17 January 2016,"Brave is a 2012 animated comedy-fantasy film directed by Mark Andrews and Brenda Chapman.It is the 13th Pixar film,and certainly a great one as their previous. Brave follows Merida the daughter of Scottish King Fergus and Queen Elinor.She is a skilled archer who wants to make her own fate in life and pursue her own dreams.She is then forced to get married,as the tradition requires at a certain age but she is in her own mind and seeks help from a witch to change the fate and be her own person in life. This movie is amazing,from the glorious animation to the characters who are likable just as much as they are interesting.Merida is a strong female lead character who chooses her own path in life and makes her own decisions for herself.She has dreams and most importantly is ""brave"" enough to pursue them till the very end.She's also smart and Kelly Macdonald's voice work just helps the cause with her amazing Scottish Accent. The story is very interesting and intriguing while still being emotional that gives depth to the characters.But it also has funny moments throughout,even though the finale is very dark and also even sad which in my opinion is great. People has been complaining about the twist over and over again and how it is more of a kids film than for adults,which Pixar is used to making.But I disagree because while it is an absolute treat for kids,it is also dark at times,it has adult jokes here and there and what's very important,it has character development at its finest.The place where Merida and different characters in the movie are at the beginning and where they end up is just brilliant and life changing.The lessons they learn through their adventures,them being good or bad,and the way that this movie teaches people that we can make our own fate if we are brave enough to follow our hearts,that makes for an unforgettable experience.",Brave

Everything has to pay the price, bear it, enjoy it.Just as interesting as Pixar's previous animations, but the story itself has little to do with ""brave."". The theme of mother-daughter love is dissected too straightforwardly and insipidly. The Scottish style is depicted, and the soundtrack and episodes are also well suited to the atmosphere. In addition, it is really cute after becoming a bear.",Brave

173,julian-mumford,Brave but not brave enough?,6,9 December 2012,"Pixar have created a high bar for other studios to clear, equally they themselves now have to ensure that their output matches their own standard.""Brave"" is a deviation, a female protagonist not a buddy in sight and at it's heart, a mother daughter relationship movie.""Merida"" (Voice - Kelly McDonald of Boardwalk Empire fame) is the princess daughter of Lord Fergus (Billy Connolly - Voice) and Lady Elinor (Emma Thompson - voice), king and queen of a mythical Scottish rugged clan of fighters and farmers. Unfortunately, despite being carefully groomed in the ways of a lady, ""Merida"" with a shock of beautiful red flowing hair, is more content riding and hunting in the forest on her trusty stead clutching a bow and arrow.Tradition dictates that the head of the clans should provide a suitor by way of a tournament to decide who will win her hand. Most of the contenders are ""Braveheart"" rejects and being a modern free spirited girl, ""Merida"" is not so keen on this idea, resenting her life being pre-ordained, much to her mothers chagrin.Father is of course just happy to get drunk, recount bear killing stories and admire the leg he lost in the fight, a ""wee scratch"", in the Scottish way.The story takes a turn for the fantastical when ""Merida"" makes a wish with a wizened ole' witch of the woods (Julie Walters - Voice) after following will-o'-the-wisp, which is fair warning this would be a bad idea. Mother suddenly turns into a bear and all must be put right and wrapped up before sunrise on the third day, otherwise mum will be catching salmon at the local river for ever. Her three beautifully red headed wee triplet boys, forever with no mother to care for them.It almost goes without saying that the animation is superb and state of the art, hair, water, skin tones and foliage, created almost photo realistically. The casting is strong, Connolly, Robbie Coltrane and Thompson are almost a given in these roles and none of the voice talent lets the side down. Unusually for Pixar characters, they do occasionally burst into song and there is a feeling of ""Disneyfication"" about the whole project, a slightly worrying trend. We will however acknowledge the boy triplets transformed into tiny bears, are cute indeed.Will kids love it, yes of course. Bright colours, great chases and enough humour mixed into the keep the wee ankle biters engrossed and ready for bed afterwards.Parents however may feel short changed, usually nobody would accuse Pixar of being safe and boring but strangely, this is their most formulaic story yet, despite the female protagonist. The story does not always gel and there are occasions where the older viewers will be looking at the clock or their mobile phone.The film lacks a character to identify with and the offbeat story line does skew the story away from the norm into the realm of fairy tales, something Pixar have not made forays into before.Pixar do not make bad films and this pitches mid range, perhaps better than Cars 2 but falling well short of the classic films the studio is most loved for.An interesting experiment but lets hope the Disney suits do not take grab the iconic Pixar angle poised lamp and take the studio too far in the warm, fuzzy and bland direction.Summary Not classic Pixar but a solid entry into the animated CGI children's movie canon and there is little to offend or upset the wee bairn's here.Skews younger than most Pixar releases but will be enjoyed by youngsters and parents who may be making dinner or multi-tasking at the same time.http://julesmoviereviews.blogspot.co.nz/",Brave
174,cnycitylady,Brave: Great for the Family,9,29 November 2012,"Brave has a bunch of Harsh reviews that I don't think it deserved. Yes Disney could've given it a better trailer because it is a tad misleading, but the story underneath is a beautiful one. The story is of Family and love and lessons and responsibilities that all young girls have to face and accept. Yes it isn't the Macho storyline that most Pixar films are but that's why I love this one. They gave Mothers and Daughters a movie they can share and love together just like they gave Fathers and Sons back with Finding Nemo (Only Finding Nemo's storyline was better explained in the trailer.) I blame the massive let down and disappointment of this film on the preview that they gave to the theaters to show, it didn't properly let you know what to expect and so you came up with a ""better"" or more exciting story in your mind. (Which isn't as good as the actual film once you see it) Brave is great fun and visually stunning; It is touching and heartfelt and not at all too serious when teaching this lesson to young girls. Go see this movie and decide for yourself.",Brave

176,tbmforclasstsar,Brave charms with its mastery of the studio's animation and mother/daughter bonds,7,30 June 2012,"Though it may seem bizarre, it's been an entire 17 years since the release of Toy Story, the first-ever feature-length CGI animation, and the first-ever Disney/Pixar film to steal our hearts. Followed by instant classics including Finding Nemo (2003), Wall-E (2008), and Up (2009), it doesn't seem as though the studio is capable of making a bad film (well, with maybe the exception of last year's Cars 2, which I guess is still technically good). Luckily, Pixar manages to uphold its stellar reputation, even after thirteen feature films and even more short films, with Brave, the first of the studio's films to feature a female lead, as well as a female director (Brenda Chapman).Brave tells the tale of Princess Merida (Kelly Macdonald), a courageous and lively free spirit with an unbelievably fabulous head of hair (then again, I am biased). Determined to remain in charge of her own destiny, Merida refuses when her parents (Emma Thompson and Billy Connolly) inform her she is to choose one of three suitors to marry. In an act of outrage, Merida demands a spell from a witch she meets in the forest (Julie Walters), one that will change her mother and, ultimately, her fate. Merida, of course, gets precisely what it is she wishes for before she realizes it's not at all what she thought wanted, and she's quickly forced to find a way to reverse the spell before it's too late.Now, right away I will say that Brave is, unfortunately, not the studio's best, however, it does have its own charms (and it is better than Cars). True to Pixar form, this film is stunning to look at— everything from the scenic Highlands of Scotland to the individual firey curls on Merida's head—it's all impressively colored and textured, making the animation truly breathtaking. Likewise, the film boasts excellent voice talent, and the story, while it has its moments of unevenness and utter silliness, manages to to bring Scottish lore to life beautifully, as well as reveal surprising depth and a sentimental center.It's a shame that, by default, Brave must be compared to its predecessors; alone, this film is charming, funny, and sweet enough to content young and old alike; however, as part of a collection, and more specifically, as a Pixar film, Brave somewhat fails at living up to its studio's high standards. While sweet, the central narrative is essentially a sometimes tonally uneven fairy tale, one that feels more Disney than it does Pixar. In other words, the story feels safe and somewhat timid, and, apart from the relationship between Merida and her mother Elinor, doesn't feature any genuinely memorable moments. It has the tendency to feel familiar and predictable and lacks that unique spark that makes a Pixar movie, well, a Pixar movie.To read the rest of the review (IMDb form too short) visit: http://custodianfilmcritic.com/brave/",Brave

I read something recently that criticized them for not having a female protagonist sooner, but we all know why. It's the hair. Pixar spent three years making the software necessary to render Merida's poof correctly, and I can promise you it was worth waiting for. At one point she gets her hair wet, and it just looks amazing. I give the hair ten out of ten.As for the movie, it gave me the fuzzies inside, so that's good. There were a few parts that I didn't like and I won't say them so as not to spoil the film.

She's a tomboy and wants to do her own thing and her mother and father want the opposite - that's about it . The rest of the movie is filled with low brow humor , typical slapstick violence and the usual moral of the story ending. After seeing the trailer and the movie poster ,one would think Brave would be about this young girl fighting and winning battles with her bow and arrow and a rousing adventure. Instead it's a dull boring coming of age story with not much to give except for the kids who like to watch cartoon bears and other creatures frolic around the woods and moms raising their bratty teenage daughters. 3/10 .",Brave
180,datautisticgamer-74853,For Brave film viewers only,5,24 August 2016,"After the let-down that was Cars 2, I had hopes that Brave could return vitality to Pixar that they had lost post-Toy Story 3. After a viewing, though, I believe I might have raised my hopes a tad too high, as it happened to be another one of those movies that would be average for a typical animation studio but deleterious for Pixar. As with any Pixar movie, I enjoyed the animation and the attempts to make the film seem realistic, such as the lighting of backgrounds. The humor and action are highly sporadic, with most attempts not hitting the intended mark or just dragging the plot on, especially in the action scenes when an action that would solve the conflict at that period was possible yet there is a delay of several seconds before characters actually do so. The messages were nice, such as to not be confrontational for selfish reasons (it could lead to the doom of not just oneself). The characters seem to take a lot of inspiration to the point of copying from other Disney works, especially with Merida being a princess who desires more than to be confined to her family (where have we seen something like that before?). The title, I chose because if you have no fear to see any animated movies, then it might be worth your time. But with its mixture of unoriginal characters and fragile story with dreamy animation and good messages, I cannot recommend it nor not recommend it to the average film-goer.",Brave
181,bjones,A Celtic Tale to the Core,9,22 June 2012,"I was lucky enough to see this film in a movie with other paying customers. There was a liberal dose of children in the audience who, from the sounds of happiness during the showing, was proof that it should be a solid hit. Add to that a dreamy-eyed little boy of about 8 who said to me after the film, ""I gotta get me a bow and arrow!"" That's about as good a testimony as you could get.I had heard a mention from a source or two - who should remain nameless - that they had trouble with the direction the story went or that it may have been too simplistic. First, I vividly recall people complaining that the story for UP! Was too com0plex, too adult, for a kids movie. But kids liked it anyway. So, they made the story simpler this time and there are complaints from other people. You can't have it both ways. Some people would even complain if they were hanged with a new rope.What this story does try to do is present a flavor of the Highland Scots in the middle ages. Hollywood being what it is, it's certainly not historically accurate in every detail, but my word, was the animation superb! It was simply magnificent in the depth and complexity. The star, Merida's, hair certainly had center stage a lot. I loved it! Such a riotous bouquet of autumn beauty is hard to find in real life, although I have to say I have a friend of long acquaintance who's hair is EXACTLY like Merida's. My only complaint about that character is with that coloring she screamed with the need for freckles! That would have made her visually perfect to type and character and the absence really disappointed me.Second, as to the story elements; I feel certain that there are few places on earth with a rich a history of mythical and magical creatures; all of which were taken quite seriously and believed without doubt. The old stories are replete with such tales containing Druids, witches, soothsayers, faeries, brownies, ùruisg, gruagach, little people, silkies, water horses, banshees, Bean-shìdh, kelpies, Blue Kelpies, Seonaidh's, Changelings, Wulvers (a sort of kindly werewolves), Will-o'-the-wisps, Nuckelavees (a quite monstrous elf) and on and on. All of which goes to say that this animated film rests smack in the center of an ancient and rich culture and does it some justice, not in overreaching accuracy, but certainly in underlining the look and feel of the land and the people.I loved it, my daughter loved it and my grandkids loved it (it didn't hurt that this grouping contains several people with red hair). We loved the look of the people, the costumes, the sets - especially the forested ones and the wonderful voices! Billy Connolly, Kelly Macdonald and Emma Thompson all did a wonderful job.Oh, yeah, my 5 year-old grandson wants the girl ... ;) By Bruce L. Jones http://webpages.charter.net/bruce.jones1/",Brave
182,Angels_Review,Pixar doesn't seem to change,8,17 April 2014,"I love different stories from different cultures, especially those that revolve around beliefs. Brave is along the lines of a Scottish story of a woman who did not want to be held down. She was woman who spoke her mind, who didn't follow customs and wanted to be free. I love stories like that as much as I like traditions. The main point of the story was slightly hard to understand weather it was about family or just an overall thing of give and take but I think the point is still there. They talk about destiny as well but I don't feel that it was the main point of the story as much as the other idea of giving in a little to others and not overbear them with responsibilities. It might be that its about something going on in my life that I think that but that's my feeling.In some aspects, Pixar has not broken their mold for movies, and in some aspects I'm happy about that. In others, I just feel they should break it a bit more so we can have a little bit more ideas. I love the characters personalities. They are extremely fun and I couldn't help but fall in love with all of them from the rather weak and odd sons to the fun loving Merida. The only problem with it is that some of the characters seem like every other character Pixar has in their movies. Especially the background characters as they were just comical with the same feeling that every other background character they normally have.The animation is actually really nice. I love how the characters have their own looks and feels to them, especially the different tribes of Scotland. It's a little hard to talk about the proportions and stuff when it's basically part of the characters that they are disproportionate. The whole feeling of the show was much like 'How to Train your Dragon' with its beautiful textures and Celtic style. The only problem was the wild hair that Merida had. At times, it was way too hard to see her face or understand just what was going on with it. Near the ending, I don't really understand the snow falling as the show had no snow in it.As with most Scottish voices, sometimes it's really hard to understand what they are saying, especially when they have a very strong accent and angry. I had to rewind and play it again and even then, I had trouble understanding. I guess that means they did their job in making the accent real but if I can't understand them, then what am I going to say about the script? The times I did understand them (which luckily was the main characters), the script was really good. I fell in love with the heart warming ideas and the love shown between the characters. The music was awesome, giving the very Celtic feeling and I felt like I was listening to music at a renascence festival. It fit the mood of the show really well.",Brave
183,kols,Destined for a better reception,9,20 April 2014,"First of all, unless you're talking about a sequel or re-make, comparing films rarely makes sense. I'm sure there are exceptions but Brave isn't one of them.This movie stands on its own quite well - the pluses far out weigh the minuses.The big pluses: Merida and Elinor. The big minuses: Fergus and The Suitors. Fergus himself looks like he's had his head squished between a pan and a rock while all of the suitors share similar physical deformations. Comic relief I guess; Brave doesn't need it.All three of the movie's movements center on Merida and Elinor. The first chronicles Merida's growth into a fiercely independent teenager, a growth supported by both Elinor and Fergus, until it gets to be time for the traditional betrothal of The Princess, which comes as a shock to Merida.She doesn't react well, launching the second movement in which she flees, searches for an alternative and winds up making a very bad choice, which winds up turning Elinor into a bear.Third movement is the ultimately successful quest to reverse the curse.Merida and Elinor are central to all three parts and all three approach, at moments, perfection. From Fergus presenting Merida with her first bow to Merida's rejection of the suitors and the process they represent, Merida's growth into that teenager is about as focused and entertaining as you can get. Same with the other movements: tight focus on the issue at hand, told with skill, intelligence and an eye toward the unexpected and its consequences, as well as Merida's successful conquest of those consequences.As for the ending - well, it is a FairyTale with a FairyTale ending and, while weaker than than the other three parts, does serve well enough as a coda returning to tonic.Brave does occasionally swerve into irrelevant shtick, especially towards the end, but manages to keep on the road and what is a movie without its minor imperfections?",Brave
184,cattjones,Great 3D and Fun,9,22 June 2012,"I think that what I liked about going to see this film is that although I had seen the trailers many times, I had no clue what the film was going to be about. Initially I guessed that maybe it was about a young woman finding her true love. Boy was I wrong. All I knew was that the animation was going to be great. I heard an interview about this film and one of the directors stated that the most difficult part for the animation team was getting Merida's hair just right. Her hair looked like mine after I've been swimming and it dries naturally. Needless to say it was pretty nappy, but it worked for this film. I wanted to see this film in 3D because the trailer made it look very inviting. When I got to the theater I sat behind a group of young children to gauge their reaction (just in case my inner child had other plans). The kids were totally engaged and did not make a peep during the entire film. This is always a good sign because before the film started they were jabbering away. The animators made Merida and all the other characters very lifelike. This included the persona of a typical teenager and the very small world that they live in (it's all about them). I love the fact that the film is set in the Scottish Highlands and that every now and then when a character spoke, you couldn't tell what the heck he was saying. (That's okay; the characters in the film couldn't understand him either). I would be remiss if I did not mention the mischievous trio of brothers. They had me cracking up and got into all sorts of stuff. This film definitely touches on the mother and daughter bonding experience and ultimately drives home the fact that you have to do what's in your heart to do. When the film was over all the kids in the theater were applauding. Although I do not think that this is one of Pixar's better works, it was definitely enjoyable and worth seeing in 3D. The only caution that I would point out is there is a very scary looking wolf/bear (whatever) that might frighten very young children. I say gather up your brood and go check it out.

Brave looked fresh, an epic fantasy adventure from a big budget, yet highly respected studio.Saw it with the family. Came out with all four of us underwhelmed.One of Pixar's defining trademarks is its unique ideas. They can create fantastic worlds, and use plots barely explored before. You're not going to find another movie about an old man and his floating house on a quest to save a rare bird from another old man and his dogs, just for a boy's approval. Brave...is just another princess deconstruction, set in a pretty plain Scotland. There's bears, I suppose.I know that its a family movie, but the plot was so predictable, there's little suspense. Especially the ending. Jeez. I didn't love any of the characters, and its theme doesn't seem necessary today. Heck, when it comes to movies straying from princess stereotypes, Disney already produced two better films not 3 years before Brave: The Princess and the Frog and Tangled.Nothing about the film was terrible. And the animation was pretty good, although it didn't have much to do beyond the main's hair. But in terms of plot, character, and writing, nothing amazed me, or even stood out.

187,Treyroo,Highly entertaining,7,24 November 2012,"What if you'd been told your whole life that you were destined for something you didn't want? Worse yet, something you hated with almost every fiber of your being. How far would you go to change it?King Fergus and Queen Elinor (voiced by Billy Connolly and Emma Thompson, respectively) have four children. Their triplet sons Hubert, Harris, and Hamish, and there oldest, a daughter, named Merida (voiced by Kelly Macdonald). Before her brothers were born Merida (Macdonald) bore witness as a bear attacked her family and took her father's leg. Subsequent to the attack, Merida, much to her mother's dismay, has grown into a free spirit who rejects her mother's influence. This doesn't stop her mother from offering tips as to how a princess must behave on a near constant basis, however. And when Merida hears the ancient tale of a prince who broke off from his duty and caused his kingdom's downfall, she rejects it without a thought. So, even with her daughter's objections, the Queen holds a contest for the first-born sons of nearby allied clans. The winner will receive her daughter's hand. As the first- born of her clan, Merida competes and wins, causing a rift that is exacerbated when Merida destroys a tapestry and the Queen retaliates by throwing Merida's bow in the fire. Merida flees to the forest in anger and follows a will o' the wisp to a cabin. The old woman inside first insists that she is a wood carver but changes her tune once Merida offers a family amulet in trade for the witch's services. The witch gives Merida a cake and tells her that it will change her mother, leaving out a few minor details as to the nature of that change and telling her only that the spell becomes permanent after the second sunrise.Kelly Macdonald is tragically underrated as an actress. I first saw her in Two Family House, an independent film released in 2000 and then in the 2005 BBC film The Girl in the Café. She had some recent success thanks to Boardwalk Empire, but nowhere near what she deserves, in my opinion. She does a great job as Merida, and I feel similarly about the job Connolly does voicing King Fergus. Thompson does well, but the role doesn't have anywhere near the same number of lines, for obvious reasons. The story is highly entertaining, as is the music. I will say that the ultimate consequence of the main character's actions leave a little something to be desired. Still, a great time.",Brave
188,garethvk,A Solid Film From Pixar,8,22 June 2012,"The digital wizards at Pixar have an incredible dossier of Academy award-winning animated films. Their latest film ""Brave"", is a prime example of the bold new direction for the company behind such classics as ""Finding Nemo"", ""Toy Story"", ""The Incredible's"", and ""Monsters, Inc."" just to name a few. This time out Scotland provides the setting for the animation masters to weave their magic, and they do in a splendid 3-D feast of sight, sound, and color that captures the breathtaking beauty of the Scottish Highlands.For Princess Merida (Kelly Madonald), life is filled with joy and frustration. As the daughter to King Fergus (Billy Connolly), and Queen Elinor (Emma Thompson), she has to walk a fine line between the duties and expectation of her mother and her freewheeling lifestyle of daring and adventure. The young Princess is content to ride through the countryside astride her horse Angus, and perfect her already admirable archery skills.When Merida learns that her parents have summoned the other major clans so that a worthy suitor can be chosen, Merida rebels openly at their plan and causes great embarrassment to her family during a competition. In a fit of rebellious anger, Merida rides into the woods, and comes upon a witch who promises to create for the young princess a spell that will forever change her destiny. Although not done out of malice, the spell has some on expected consequences that threatens the future of the kingdom as well as the safety of Merida's family. The film has some outstanding performances, not the least of which is Connolly, who was an absolute delight whenever his character was on screen. Supporting work by Craig Ferguson and Robbie Coltrane complement the leads well. Since my mother is a Scot, I am all-too-familiar with not only the history but culture of Scotland. I had been concerned when I first heard the project that it would play up on certain stereotypes and miss the true complexity and splendor of Scotland and its people, as well as it's extremely rich history which is filled with numerous technical and literary achievements over the centuries.Thankfully my concerns were allayed very early in the film not simply because of the amazing visual detail of the movie but also because of the lovable but quirky characters. The writers and animators managed to capture the very nature of the people and the culture, which is no easy thing in an animated film. Kudos for the casting of the mostly Scottish cast who played their roles with relish. I can honestly say hearing King Fergus address the clans brought to mind my aunts, uncles and cousins thanks to the distinct Scottish brogue. I especially liked the fact that when conflict erupted (of course) amongst even the best of friends, there are some very clever ways that laughs were gained without turning the characters into buffoons or being overly cute.While the film plays it fairly safe with the story, Pixar's first female heroine gives us a very fun and enjoyable tale that offers something for the entire family without talking down to the audience or having to resort to crude humor. A few scenes may be a bit intense for youngsters and while it will not be cited for any technological breakthroughs Brave, nonetheless, is highly entertaining.4 stars out of 5",Brave

190,valen060,A Pixar Film That Barely Succeeds,9,22 June 2012,"The moment I read the critic reviews about ""Brave,"" I had to rush immediately to the local movie theater to watch and see what they saw. After watching every scene and the entire story unfold, I was actually impressed all the way to the end!So, it focuses on a rebellious princess named Merida that dreams to live her own life the way she wants it, rather than having to follow her family's royal, age-old traditions.As one critic stated in his review, it's reminiscent of Pixar's 2003 movie ""Finding Nemo."" Why? Because the thematic element of that movie focused on the bonding between a father and son, whereas ""Brave"" focused on the complete opposite by focusing on the bonding between a mother and daughter. And I started to get that impression as well. Not to mention that it seems to have a cross of the thematic material of ""Finding Nemo"" and (hint) a similar scenario of Disney's hand-drawn film ""Brother Bear.""Overall, I thought it was a Pixar film that greatly surpasses the 2011 critical disappointment of Cars 2. Although I'll admit the film's story felt rushed and could have expanded slightly more, it was legitimate enough and had some mature elements older kids could understand. Fellow 'Harry Potter' alums like Julie Walters, Emma Thompson, and Robbie Coltrane, did a fine job bringing their characters to life with such poise. But, I was in awe seeing and hearing a well-done acting performance by Scottish native/actress Kelly MacDonald (of Boardwalk Empire fame) voicing the lead Merida, and a first for Pixar Animation Studios to focus more on not just their first female lead or first fairy tale-theme, but leaning towards a darker tone compared to their previous lighthearted CG films.

The story is the real turkey here as I kept waiting for it to develop only to sadly discover, oh, the mother turning into a bear IS the story. They attempt to espouse that one need not find adventure beyond their own realm, or was it a story to bring mother and daughter closer together, I don't know, it wasn't clear to me. Most Pixar films have been family ones, but this is a kiddie installment. It has a few moments of humor, but a lot of the films moments borrows from others. Too many scenes focus on needless minutia and unrelated activities that I found pointless, boring, and non-productive.I still don't know why the film is titled ""Brave"" as my interpretation of that word differs sharply from that of the writer's.",Brave
192,chloebetts,Great Disney movie,8,3 August 2021,This movie is so wholesome. I think it's a great family movie with a good lesson.,Brave
193,Animated_Antic,A pleasant fantasy film.,8,28 August 2018,"It was only a matter of time before Pixar decided to tackle the fantasy genre. Even though it's a category Disney Animation has delved into several times with their fairy tales, Pixar typically stayed away it and usually let their sister company handle the movies. Then they decided to bring on board former Disney storyboarded Brenda Chapman and allowed her to direct a new animated movie with Mark Andrews called ""Brave"". Although it doesn't reach the levels of set by Pixar's other films and does borrow too many elements from Disney, I still found enjoyment in the film. It's flawed, yes, but I certainly don't think it was a bad movie. In fact, I found it pretty good.In the medieval times in Scotland, a princess named Merida (Kelly Macdonald) is getting frustrated with her mother, Queen Elinor (Emma Thompson), constantly pushing forth protocol towards her at being a proper princess and instead yearns to go through the Scottish landscapes and practice her archery skills. To make things even more dismaying for her, she is intended to be betrothed to one of three sons to her father's allies and wishes not to marry quite yet. However her mother warns her that if she doesn't consent to the betrothal, the kingdom could fall into despair. Frustrated, Merida flees and after following spirit like ghosts known as Will-o'-the-wisps, she stumbles upon the wood cottage of a witch (Julie Walters) with whom she bargains to change her fate. After being given a cake whom she then gives to her mother, Merida is stunned to find her mother transformed into a bear and must figure out how to change her back and sets things right before it's too late.So as you could tell from the story, it's definitely not one of Pixar's strongest. It takes many elements from Disney's fairy tales as well as ""Brother Bear"" and combines them together to some interesting results. The good thing about is that it's definitely better than ""Brother Bear"" as it has a more timeless feel and also has more likable characters and it's especially better than Pixar's mess that was ""Cars 2"". However, it could've been better. The story just didn't have that feel that the ""Toy Story"" movies or ""Up"" brought to the table which is kind of a shame. Still though, I did find some enjoyment in it. The animation is stunning. This is something I definitely would see the movie for because the Scottish world that Pixar created is stunning to look at. It definitely has a cool feel to it and did have the fantasy quality I yearned for and even small details like Merida's bright red curly hair just popped out of the screen. I just really loved the look of the film. The characters are for the most part pretty likable. I did find Merida a little too whiny at times compared to the other Disney princesses and will admit that she did get too annoying, but I certainly didn't find her terrible. I guess she just reminded me too much of a sixteen year old teenager which I will give credit to Pixar for nailing the details on it. The real star of the movies were the supporting characters. The witch Merida comes across in the woods being a humble woodcutter was enjoyable and I certainly loved Merida's rambunctious father played by Billy Connolly. I've always found him enjoyable so hearing him in the movie was pretty fun. Even Merida's mischievous triplet brothers provided some fun laughs.So, do I recommend ""Brave"" in the end? Yeah, I think it's worth watching. It's story and some of it's characters may not be up to the standards that are seen in Pixar's other films, but I still found the animation incredible and the supporting characters fun enough. It's a pretty good example of a movie I can consider good, but not great. However, I can still watch a good movie any day and this is a film I can see myself watching sometime again.",Brave
194,blackwidowis7cool,Okay I guess,7,24 June 2019,"It's okay. Definitely a Disney movie, but below Pixar's usual standard.
As a princess, Merida is required to act and behave a certain way. But Merida chafes against the bit, so to speak, and it results in a strained relationship with her mother. After a big fight with her mother Eleanor, Merida escapes into the forest to be alone and stumbles across a witch, who gives her some food, claiming it will change her mother. But the witch forgot one little problem - and it does change the mother.
Into a bear.
And Merida is given a task to complete before the second sunrise, otherwise her mother will permanently be a bear.
The CGI is pretty good.
It has great themes and I love the lessons that Merida and her mother learn throughout the course of this movie.
The climax is amazing. Emotionally resonant and strong and very suspenseful. I heavily applaud it and the genuinely funny beginning.
The woman who voices Merida, I've forgotten her name, does an excellent job in playing her role and she makes Merida really relatable and you sympathize with her, but also with her mother as well, even though they are at odds.
But, I found it dark and I just couldn't enjoy it as much as other Disney Pixar movies.
Overall, an okay movie. Give it a go.",Brave
195,brent_or,Beautiful looking but conceptually a bit messy...,6,29 June 2012,"I do not think that Brave belongs on the list of transcendental, virtually perfect Pixar classics. Granted, it definitely contains some of the most beautiful computer animation that I have ever seen. Ten years ago, who would have thought that computer-generated hair could be so breathtakingly exciting? I love the hair (and fur) in Brave! But my problem with this movie is that it feels conceptually disjointed. Yes, the story is pretty easy to follow on a basic level, and yes, it is entertaining. The thing is that the main point/moral just comes across as forced, which means that, for me at least, all of the great individual elements do not add up to a greater whole. ""Brave"" is a wonderful title, but the film itself struggles to bring it home by the time that the credits roll. Anyway, I guess that I was expecting more, or different.",Brave
196,Martinito_08183,A fascinating and beautiful movie with some weak aspects.,7,18 May 2019,"Brave is a movie that you may like or don't like and for those years after it was released, everyone made the conclusion that it's not good at all. I fall on the category of people who like it, but like many others - i still have problems with it. The movie has a story that people were expecting, that didn't deliver, but that doesn't mean it's bad because of it. The problem that i have with the story is that the first act is the strongest one, while the second and the third act (except the ending, because for me it does have a very good conclusion) are the weakest. The script / dialogue is very mixed for me. I liked the main cast - Merida and her family, but the side (or supporting) characters were weak in my opinion. While i may be torn on the story, the characters and the script, it is still successful in the technical aspects - beautiful animation (with some strange movements in some moments), great sound, great music, great cinematography and great acting (depends on the country you live in). Even with it's problem, i still find the movie fascinating while watching it and it's a movie that i can revisit again and again in the future.",Brave
197,98nurdinm-1,Brave,7,30 August 2012,"Princess Merida (Kelly Macdonald) lives in Medieval Scotland with her royal parents (Emma Thompson and Billy Connolly). From an early age she has preferred a bow and arrow to polite manners and proper princess conduct. Her mother, however, has other ideas, and arranges a competition for the other clans first borns to win her hand. Mother and daughter are now set against each other, but when Merida tries to use magic to change her fate, the two of them end up having to work together before everything changes...The Pixar canon has more times then not produced stunning films; not only are the visuals impressive, the story and the script is on the same level. Unlike their rivals at Dreamworks and Fox, they are also very careful to not sell a film just on the stars that are playing the characters. A classic example: how many more people went to see ""Kung Fu Panda"" because Jack Black was in it? However, there have been occasions where the films just haven't met the high standards set by their greatest works,examples off which include ""Wall-E"", ""Up"", ""Finding Nemo"", ""The Incredibles"" and, of course, the ""Toy Story Trilogy"". The lesser films, though occasional blips, stick out like sore thumbs in the otherwise impressive history.Sadly, ""Brave"" is in this category. That's not to say it isn't any good; it's a lot better than a lot of films out at the moment and a lot of animation that has been out over the last year. The concept of having a film set entirely in Medieval Scotland is a risky one for certain, particularly when you consider the international market and the US cinemas.The visuals are stunning, though - Scotland's wild Highland countryside is perfectly captured by the Pixar geniuses; cloth, water and fur are all wonderfully created to the quality we have come to expect. The almost entirely Scottish cast, ably led by Kelly Macdonald as Princess Merida, are very good, if a little uninspiring, particularly when you have Billy Connolly in the credits.But the story lets the film down. After an impressive opening, the film becomes a kind of lacklustre cousin to the dire Disney film ""Brother Bear"", one of the films in the early 2000s that put a death knell on the classic Disney giant status. There is also a significant lack of any proper villain in the film. Julie Walters, as a witch, is potentially wasted as an antagonist, which is left to a demon bear who, while scary enough for little people, just doesn't have the same effect as Lotso Bear or Syndrome.This however is from a grown man's point of view; having watched it in a cinema full of little people who throughly enjoyed it from the gasps and cheers and laughs, one can definitely say that this is the best Pixar kids film the studio has made for some time. But the joy of Pixar's greatest hits is that you can watch them whatever age and find something in them for you. Although the film's visuals are certainly captivating, there is very little else for grown ups here.7/10",Brave
198,aaronjbong,"Pixar Nailed it Again, Now with a Tale of a Rebellious Princess and Caring Mother",8,29 June 2012,"Today, Pixar is undoubtedly one of the most invincible force in the movie industry. Since ""Toy Story 2"", the studio has unleashed nine-straight string of $200 million movies and each of their movies have been favored by both audiences and critics alike. Even though last year's ""Cars 2"" failed to meet expectations in both critical (I still liked it though) and box office prospects, Pixar is still undeniably one of the most powerful studios existing now and the arrival of 2012's ""Brave"" just reaffirms that statement.Stepping away from the world of racing cars, ""Brave"" explores the life of Princess Merida , a master archer princess living in the lands of Scotland during the Middle Ages. Apparently, she doesn't like being a princess because she thinks her whole life is fully planned and therefore she lacks freedom in her life because of her mother, Queen Elinor, and of course because of old traditions. Also, she has to decide which oldest son of the three allied clans would she marry because of old tradition which causes her to show more hate to her mother. In an attempt to change her mother's mind, she seeks a witch living in the middle of a dark forest for a magical spell that will change her mother. Unfortunately, ""change her mother"" to the witch means change physically and so Queen Elinor is transformed into a bear instead. Now, she has to reverse the curse before it's too late.Unlike other princesses out there, Merida is a tomboy, a master archer, a rebellious teenage girl who dislikes being a princess. Her father, King Fergus gave her her first bow in the beginning of the movie. This causes it to distance the movie from other princess movies. She's a warrior, magnet to danger, full of courage, unlike those princesses who act all clumsy when they meet the villains. She has triplet brothers: Harris, Hubert, and Hamish. They are even worse than Merida. They act like little devils and are incredibly naughty and bring lots of trouble but they can be helpful sometimes. They are adorably-designed and will undoubtedly be audience favorites.Merida's parents are Queen Elinor and King Fergus. Queen Elinor is a highly proper mother. She's caring, kind, patient, but also stern, highly organized, very tidy, and sometimes can be annoying to Merida because of her queen-like personality. King Fergus on the other hand is more cheerful, messy, and playful, sometimes to Elinor's dismay. In the beginning of the movie, King Fergus lost his leg in an encounter with an ancient savage bear named Mor'du. From then on, he's sworn revenge against the bear.The rendering of Scotland during the Middle Ages is amazing and incredible. Every point in the grasslands, every shrub is just incredibly detailed. The trees and everything look so lifelike that I almost forgot that I was watching an animated toon, not a live-action film. This shows how Pixar is one of the best movie creators of all time. The 3D enlivens the scenes even more and is recommended.Perhaps the one thing that downgraded this film was its climax. I was expecting a battle with Mor'du yes, but also a little involvement with the witch, maybe a little cameo or maybe using the full potential of her powers. Instead, the witch skipped the scene and left it to Mor'du to handle alone. Also, Merida didn't really get involved in the climax because it was actually Queen Elinor as the bear who did most of the fighting. Even King Fergus and his allied clans are no match for Mor'du.Continuing the tradition of having short films precede the films, ""Brave"" is preceded by an animated short named ""La Luna"". The short is about a boy with his father and grandfather who are sailing on a boat. They then stop in the middle of the sea and use a ladder (that's right) to go to the Moon. Apparently the Moon is made up of dozens of glowing smaller stars. The three then sweep the stars to form a crescent moon shape. All I have to say about ""La Luna"" is that it's gorgeous, marvelous, and beautiful.""Brave"" is a highly recommended film and anyone disappointed with Pixar's previous entry ""Cars 2"" will be satisfied with the latest film from one of the most dominant forces in the movie industry. It may not be groundbreaking but it offers a lot of fun, plenty of humor, and lovable characters notably Merida's triplet brothers. ""Brave"" also sends out a message to improve communication between mothers and daughters. With great voice performances, ""Brave"" offers satisfaction.Rating: 8/10 Final Verdict: It may not be groundbreaking but ""Brave"" is a great film that reaffirms the fact that Pixar is one of the powerful forces in the movie industry.",Brave
199,chuck-526,gripping tale of adolescence well worth seeing (very very mild spoiler),9,23 June 2012,"I watched Brave a couple times today. I want to say this carefully: It's very very good, definitely well worth watching ...but it's not quite as great as some others.The animation is superb. I didn't expect to see somebody pull rack focus in an animation (and especially not to have it be totally believable). I was so in the moment that when snot dangled from a little kid's nose, my automatic reaction was ""ew, gross"" ...just like most of the people around me to judge from all the noise in the theater. When a human transformed by a witch into a larger body size kept bumping into things and causing clatters all over, that was totally believable too. And a closeup of a galloping horse that came into full focus every mid-stride but raced just a little bit beyond the film at the beginning of each stride was so realistic I was looking for the sweat beads.Fur and cloth, which as I understand it were once the frontiers of animation, are so natural they seem like just throw-aways here.Pixar has gone beyond a full portrayal of reality into ""hyper-reality"". Everywhere you look, there's ""more"" than there would be in real life. The whole thing felt a little like the extremely lush vegetation in ""Avatar"". Just one specific example: there are more species of plant growing in the forest than I'd expect to see in a real forest. There's very little ""squash-and-stretch"" - probably it wouldn't mesh with such a ""real"" portrayal. The story was thrilling too, especially at the end. But I did have some quibbles. The first half hour seemed a little off-stride. Although the title is ""Brave"" and quite a few story elements point that way, so many more point at ""intelligent"" and ""level-headed"" instead that the intensity seemed a little blunted. And the whole last part is very definitely built around the ""chase"" trope; don't get me wrong, it was extremely well done and gripped my interest big-time ...but after it was over I realized I'd been hoping Pixar would paint a little further outside the box.I saw the preceding short ""La Luna"" during the Academy Award competitions last spring, so it wasn't new to me. It will be new to most viewers though, and it's magical. If you've ever been frustrated at not understanding a film spoken in some other language, this will cure you - there's not an intelligible word spoken anywhere, yet everything is completely clear.",Brave

Well, now there's Brave.",5,29 October 2012,"You can't actually discern exactly what Brave is about from the trailer and so I was sort of going in blind when I saw it. I loved the beginning at it was really good and realistic and all that and then the plot started and it just felt like I was watching the Scottish version of Brother Bear; some scenes were directly from that movie. So the start was great, the middle was okay and the end was kinda predictable. There was though some very funny parts in it that I wasn't expecting and the design for Mor'du was awesome. So overall I liked it and I wouldn't mind watching it again if it was on. Not expecting a sequel and nor do I want it on DVD but I wasn't bored watching it.http://theojreviews.blogspot.co.uk/",Brave
202,jafar-iqbal,A return to form for those Pixar geniuses,8,16 September 2012,"Disney's ugly stepchild, affectionately known as Pixar, is back. Old reliable, usually, though their last outing was actually quite rubbish. Nobody in their right mind – adults and children alike – could claim Cars 2 was a cinematic success. It wasn't. But that was a mere glitch because, with Brave, they are back to their brilliant best.Brave is the story of Merida (Kelly MacDonald), a rebellious Scottish princess who prefers riding on her horse and using her bow than acting ladylike and princess-y. When the time comes for her to get married and fulfil her duty as princess, Merida decides to take matters into her own hands and consults a witch.Brave's biggest achievement is its attention to detail: this might all be CGI, yes, but Scotland has never looked so beautiful. The animation is as close to perfect as you could possibly get, which makes watching the film that much more enjoyable. What you really come to see, though, is a good story and great characters. Brave has both. Kelly MacDonald, as Merida, is brilliant. She's come a long way from Trainspotting all those years ago, and deservedly so. Here, she also has the benefit of voicing a beautifully-written character. Pixar has a history of creating well-rounded, real characters - just look at Toy Story, Up and Wall-E – and Brave can be added to that list.There's very little to fault about the movie, if I'm honest. When trying to be funny, it's laugh-out-loud funny. The emotion is emotional. It hits all the right notes, and never stops entertaining. I can't even complain about it being too long, because it's not. The thing about Pixar is that they concentrate on every single thing with utmost care and attention. The CGI is stunning, but it's also a brilliant story with excellent characters.It's refreshing to see that an American animation company can create such an authentically Scottish movie. Kudos.",Brave
203,nikashvili,A Beautiful Work from Pixar,9,24 September 2012,"Brave is a new Animated Feature from Pixar and probably this years the best. This is a story of rebel princess trying to changer her fate, to somehow escape from ill-fated life of future queen. So she rides to the very deep in forest and meets a witch asking to changer her mom. The witch makes princess wish come true but in the way that Merida could not imagine and would never wish. That's why she struggles to save beloved mother from the consequences of her own desires.Brave is different from Pixar normal animations and Princess Merida is opposite of all well-known princesses in fairy tail history. She fights, she is funny (most princesses are boring and sad) and not that sweet as the rests. So the story is absolutely original and fascinating.Last year, I thought Cars 2 was the edge of Pixar's creative works. Now I am sorry for that. Brave is visually stunning, beautifully pictured, spectacularly designed and well told story. I loved the landmarks of Scottish nature and I find the idea of ""Scottish Story"" just amazing.On the other hand, screen writing was perfect for animation with lots of dark and light jokes, funny moments and a little bit touching plot. Composers have done outstanding job by making original themes from Scottish national tunes because it helps to tell a story a lot.All in all Pixar has overwhelmed itself this year. They've made a showy, interesting and a very tasty animation about the persons who live inside every of us. But most of people out there are not that Brave to make themselves oppose the general order, their families and friends who don't understand them. Maybe someone could learn something...Read reviews on my blog: http://running-reel.blogspot.com/",Brave
204,changmoh,Highland Fling For Young Girls,7,20 June 2012,"""Brave"" is basically a mother-daughter tale set in the Scottish Highlands and spiced with mirth, myth and magic. It is suitably action-packed and centred around a young red-haired heroine that most of today's young girls can relate with. However, its magical elements tend to run away with the story and leave older viewers dissatisfied.The heroine is Merida (Kelly MacDonald), a skilled archer and impetuous daughter of King Fergus (Billy Connolly) and Queen Elinor (Emma Thompson). Determined to carve her own path in life, Merida defies an age-old suitor custom sacred to the uproarious lords of the land: the massive Lord MacGuffin (Kevin McKidd), surly Lord Macintosh (Craig Ferguson) and cantankerous Lord Dingwall (Robbie Coltrane). Merida's actions inadvertently unleash chaos and fury in the kingdom, and when she turns to an eccentric old Witch (Julie Walters) for help, she is granted an ill-fated wish. The ensuing peril forces Merida to discover the meaning of true bravery in order to undo a beastly curse before it's too late.The first half of ""Brave"" is suitably absorbing, fleshing out the characters and personalities, especially of Merida and her mother who are the strongest individuals in conflict against each other. The others in the cast, especially the males, are mostly presented as caricatures, with all of them behaving like buffoons. The free-spirited Merida will not take her pick of them as her suitor - despite Queen Elinor's attempts to bend her daughter's will to the dictates of custom and tradition.The story gets a bit weirder in the second half when it takes on a body-switch twist. From this point on, the battle of wills between mother and daughter is all but put aside as our attention turns to Merida's new crisis. Some reviewers have attributed the movie's lack of plot coherence to the fact that story creator Brenda Chapman left the project midway, leaving Mark Andrews to maintain the directorial reins. I wish to stay neutral on this debate.However, I get the feeling that the plot is missing something when we consider that Merida, in pursuing her right to be 'liberated' rejects all suitors, but leaves her future and that of her 'kingdom' unresolved. Verdict: Not as memorable as ""Finding Nemo"" and ""Up"", but entertaining for the kids, nonetheless. (Full review at limchangmoh.blogspot.com)",Brave
205,sildarmillion,1. All things Pixar. 2. Misleading Marketing. 3. Merida rocks!,10,1 July 2012,"Let me say right off the bat that I thought this was a great film. Just like any other Pixar film, it kept me invested and it elicited a whole range of emotions and reactions from me. It looked wonderful, the characters were beautifully drawn and developed, it was hilarious without being cheesy, it was suspenseful when it needed to be, but it had its extremely sweet and touching moments.Nevertheless, I totally went in expecting a different movie; and I blame the movie's marketing for it! The trailers had me pumped for a darker, more mature and more epic story with higher stakes and more realistic consequences. Thinking back on it, I'm not sure why I fell into that trap. This was a Pixar movie after all - and Pixar wasn't about to make it's film inaccessible to kids! Let me explain why I was misled. I've watched every trailer for this movie, and after watching it, I must say that the trailers reveal information regarding only about the first 20 minutes of the film. We did know that there was some type of spell involved, but we were never told what it would do. My cousin and I had talked about this; and we had our guesses. And we were right. Not going to spoil it here; but that should have tipped me off that this was going to be a kid's movie.Many people will disagree that this is a kid's movie because there are some scenes that are legitimately too scary for kids. Hence the PG rating. I'm not talking about the scary sequences when I say this is a kid's movie. I'm talking about the logic; and this film follows a very kid-movie logic with kid-movie stakes and kid-movie consequences. That's not a bad thing at all. It's just that the trailers had set us up for something much more mature and more epic. The trailers focused so heavily on how Merida broke tradition, that I had really come to expect more focus on the consequences of that. And the movie does start out on a very mature note. But then at one point it starts to go down the kid- movie path, once you realize that the scale of the story is pretty small. No grand adventure where she scales mountains of 10th century Scotland and conquers her destiny like the trailers would have us believe. There was an adventure, yes, but of kid's movie proportions.I can't explain this in the context of Brave without spoilers. So I shall explain this in the context of Up (spoiler warning for Up). The first 15 minutes of Up had some of the best story-telling I had ever seen. It had a lot of gravity and a lot of depth; and then the fun adventure that followed - with houses floating away on balloons, and dogs that can voice their thoughts through a machine, scary dogs with chipmunk voices, and a cartoony villain - had a completely different tone to it. The first 15 minutes and the rest of the movie are like two different movies. You get tuned for something mature, but then you have to readjust your expectations really fast, because you realize Up isn't about an old man dealing with the emptiness in his heart as much as it is about a fun family-friendly adventure with a senior citizen, a little Asian kid, a dog and a giant bird. The same thing happens with Brave.I just wish they hadn't marketed it so much to an older audience. Mirror Mirror did the same thing. That movie should have just marketed itself to little girls instead of to teens, and then it wouldn't have received so much hate; because in my opinion, Mirror Mirror was a good film for little girls. It had a positive and empowering message as well.Brave fares much better than Mirror Mirror though just because it's Pixar. Pixar can always deliver a fun heartwarming tale (pretend that Cars 2 didn't happen). It was awesome in the way only a Pixar movie can be; and it had one of the best cast of characters I've seen. And Merida was honestly a rocking heroine. Her animation gorgeous - and not just her hair, but all of her movements were spectacular!Thankfully I was able to reorient my expectations in time to enjoy the lovely cinematography and heart warming tale; and so this movie gets a 10 on 10. But if you've heard people say that this will be one of Pixar's forgettable flicks, I can't totally disagree, and that will be because Pixar picked the wrong way to hype up this film. But Princess Merida, you keep rocking, girl! Pixar's first female protagonist definitely delivers!",Brave

209,z-59713,Film review,7,28 March 2020,"Unlike Pixar's animated feature films in the past, brave is the first non modern movie featuring real people. Although it is generally believed that this movie represents Pixar's average level, it is not as shocking as toy story, undersea story and flying house.The story takes place in the distant ancient Scotland. The bad tempered Princess Merida is arranged by the powerful Queen's mother to marry the most powerful prince among the three tribes. But the ambition of the first-class princess with red hair and archery is far more than that. Moreover, the princes of the three tribes are all the fighting men who can't support them. But mother, Merida atmosphere ran to the trees, but accidentally met the witch. She asked the witch for a charm that could change her mother's decision, but she didn't expect to get into big trouble.The background of the story is quite mythical, but it is about the conflicts that every family may encounter: rebellious girls and overprotective mothers. When playing back the recording, I heard my laughter and cry, because there was a time when we thought our knowledge and experience had surpassed our parents, we could make decisions for ourselves and hurt them. Only when we know that we have made mistakes and really caused great losses or injuries to our parents can we realize our childishness at that time and lower our arrogant and stubborn head. Merida makes up for her mistakes with her wit and perseverance. Although it's a Disney style reunion, if it can bring positive information to children, why not?The film's picture is based on Merida's red hair, which is very retro and bright. Merida's triplet brother is very naughty and cute. Although there is no breakthrough in 3D effect, the details are perfect and worth tasting.",Brave

There's plenty here to justify the ticket, but it is a bit thin in the plot.",Brave

Wreck-It Ralph should've won the Best Animated Picture Oscar!Seriously, THAT animated film had MUCH better, original, engaging, and entertaining story than this overrated flop. Disappointing and abomination from FRIGGIN' PIXAR! Though I get them credit for giving this princess a pretty cool new look, the story & the characters felt so clichéd and non-entertaining. Other princess story archs (which we already know and seen were pulled into this story. ""The princess who doesn't want to be a princess"" (Jasmine) ""Full of adventure and explorer of new things (Belle) ""She has to marry someone she doesn't want to"" (Pocahontas) ""and the mother turns into a bear"" (Brother Bear - that one wasn't a success) And all the fighting and arguments she has with her mother are quite jarring and uninteresting to watch.It's just messing around with Disney princess story lines we've ALL seen before!Gosh, the trailers were so misleading and the whole film in particular was a HUGE letdown. It was stupid, in-cohesive, annoying, cringe-worthy, and certainly NOT a family-friendly film (in my opinion.)Mostly it just sticks with silly humor aimed at kids, and I really don't think adults would enjoy this film as much.PS: And this is the first PIXAR film that shows bare butts and a friggin' BOOB dive. DISGUSTING!Really, Pixar....",Brave
213,tendobear,Felt Like Dreamworks...,6,26 June 2012,"I think the title says it all. Brave was a fantastic movie, don't get me wrong, but it just wasn't Pixar - there are fantastic movies and there are Pixar movies that usually blows all competition out of the water - except Cars of course, but I'll leave that rant for another time. Brave had a lot of charm, magic, great characters and attention to detail, but all the way through I couldn't help feeling that one or two things were missing - humour and storytelling. When I distinguish what makes a Pixar movie different from say, a Dreamworks movie it always came down to humour and storytelling, which Brave didn't seem to have, hence it felt more like a Dreamworks movie. All the way through I was waiting for the laugh-aloud jokes that I've come to expect from a Pixar movie, but they never came. Yes, there were a few chuckle moments, but that was it - the jokes never really hit the mark. There's a part where Merida's three younger brothers are turned into bear cubs which had a lot of potential for jokes and plot development, but they were largely ignored. On a side note, the adult bears are actually pretty scary. The story also felt very mediocre - haven't we heard this one thousands of times before? A princess is to be wedded off but she doesn't want to, she wants her freedom, so she does something stupid that she regrets and she has to make amends, and everyone learns a lesson - there, I just told you the whole story, which is another reason why it felt like a Dreamworks movie, it lacked the usual creativity and imagination that makes Pixar great. I just hope their next effort will be a return to form; Brave had it's flaws but it's still not nearly as bad as Cars!",Brave
214,fawn_jane,I was disappointed,6,3 August 2013,"I was ready for a Disney-dose of girl-power but was let down. I read that the director abandoned-ship halfway through the production and it shows. The movie starts out promising then it flounders. They forgot to finish writing the second half of the plot. Eventually the protagonist ""realizes"" that refusing to be forced to marry some stranger is just her being ""selfish"" and ""spoiled"". (What the heck?) In the end the mother suddenly changes her mind about forcing her daughter to marry. What goes on in the middle of the movie seems to have nothing to do with actually resolving the interpersonal conflict. The third act of the movie is kind of dull and consists of contrived slapstick action. I call it contrived because it revolves around trying to hide the mother while the protagonist tries to accomplish something, but why did the mother have to even come along? She could have just stayed somewhere safe while the heroine did her thing.",Brave

The folks at Disney/Pixar always seem to top themselves every time they do another story and this one is excellent.This movie had my heart racing several times and also I cried, yes I admit I'm a softy. I also however thought that at times while the movie was great that it had some stories intertwined in it. Brother Bear and Beauty and the Beast I was thinking because Medora's mother gets changed into a bear although this time it was a whole different reason and also the spell being broken at the end by the words ""I love you"" from Beauty and the Beast.The only thing I would say that was bad about the movie was the dirtiness of it. We see butts and even get a sexual suggestion right at the beginning of the movie. It is also very intense for a younger viewer and I would not suggest it for kids under 12.

Still, I could SEE Emma Thompson in her animated character's every move and nuance. And Patrick Doyle's musical score is excellent.But I need emphasize that the final confrontation is the most violent scene I've ever witnessed in a Pixar movie.

As for animation, we must remember there are great and experienced artists behind it and aiming for excellence should be their one and only drive. ""The Brave"" is not one of those movies that will put a beautiful smile on your face. If anything, it works more as a sedative than energy drink: the characters are quite boring and the story is even worse.

Oscar winning is not an absolute measure, but still reveals something about quality. Roger Ebert which is not among us anymore and which reviews I admire a lot, wrote that this movie kids will love, while parents will not. I am not a parent but I am in a mature age to be one, and I liked it. It even brings tears on, which only few movies, and not one animation till this one did. I will not put much criticism about it, but it is very subjective opinion of such admiration from me. The animation is really amazing, and the sceneries are fascinating. I am myself a fan of anything Scotissh and Irish, so the complete background of the movie fits more than well to me. It is funny, sometimes very funny, and it is very emotional, especially the ending, which is very happy indeed.

While it may not stand amongst their creative best, the film is still a stunningly animated delight. It is supported by a strong central character and a mother-daughter relationship that resonates with the film's central value of family. It's a tale that will appeal to both adults and children alike.It is mostly disappointing as the film plays it quite safe as compared to previous Pixar films and it becomes decidedly predictable by the end. However that's the problem when you build such a fantastic repertoire for animated films, expectations are always high for the next. This shouldn't detract from the fact that the film deserves all the success it gets and to the people who were already disappointed by Cars 2 (which i still enjoyed), Pixar is back to its roots here- prioritizing telling a good story first.",Brave
223,TheConnoisseurReviews,Pixar's Brave,7,22 June 2012,"""Brave"" is the story a mother and daughter who don't seem to see eye to eye. There is a constant struggle between tradition and choosing ones own path, but both fail to see the middle ground. Merida wants to be free and see the world, but Elinor, her mother, wants her to be a proper princess. The story tells us that we might have our own thoughts and ways of doing things, but we also have to be careful of what might be the outcome. The message is pretty good, but I feel it loses sight in its second act, were they focus on humor more so than telling a compelling story.The film is directed well and there are so many powerful moments. One in particular is the fight between Merida and Elinor and after the fight is over Elinors reaction put a lump in my throat. However, I felt the story wasn't paced very well. The beginning is marvelous and feels like the story is going to be very grand, but the second half bogs everything down. Emotions are left for humor. The humor in the film is hit or miss and more misses than hits. They are childish, but what's worse about is that it pulls you out of some really heart wrenching moments. There isn't a balance between the heart and humor, which is rather disappointing.Characters are fine, my personal favorite is the dad, King Fergus. He's like a big likable bear. Merida is good, but she could have used more polish, aside from archery she doesn't have an identity of her own. Elinor is good too, but in the second act she loses herself much like the film. The relationship between Merida and Elinor is something to marvel at because it is so real and genuine. We feel the love they have for one another, but we also see why they can't stand each other. I really felt this story would delve more into their relationship, but in the second act it feels more like a buddy comedy only towards the end does the film realize that the story is about a mother and daughter.It's Pixar and one thing you can guarantee is that the animation is going to push the envelop and ""Brave"" is no exception. The scenery is grand and lavishing, it feels so alive. The character animations are so good and you'll know what I mean when you watch it, just look at the way Merida moves. Everything is refined and I really felt as if this was a mystical area some where in Scotland.Overall ""Brave"" is a decent flick. The animation is gorgeous and the songs and score are good as well. The beginning of the film is fantastic and really pulls you into the story and hypes you up for where it might go. However, the second act bogs everything down, the humor becomes juvenile, interest in characters are lost, and the story doesn't know what it wants to do. It goes from and endearing story about a mother daughter relationships to a buddy comedy focused and cheap laughs. I really did want to like this film, but it left me disappointed with only frustration when I look back on it now. I give a low 3.5/5, great animation, even better opening, but the rest of the film leaves more to be desired.""Caliente""",Brave
224,Foux_du_Fafa,Fairylore Pixar Style,8,26 August 2012,"""Brave"" is unlike any film made previously by Pixar. Not only does it feature a female protagonist as hyped prior to release, but it is essentially a fairy tale instead of a science-fiction or funny animal story. Having said that, it doesn't quite fit the typical Disney Princess niche that you may expect. For one thing, it isn't based on a traditional story from Grimm or Andersen, nor does it focus on a romance between two young lovers. It instead is an original story inspired by Scottish legend and focuses upon the type of family relationships that a modern audience can easily relate to. As a result, it does what a good fantasy film does best; underneath all the enchantment and magic, it speaks directly to the heart. Not to mention, the film looks beautiful. ""Brave"" perhaps won't top the list of best Pixar films, but it still ranks as a lovely, involving film.",Brave

226,Sweetigal85,A dazzling work of art,10,28 May 2017,"Disney (Pixar) has created another inspiring princess to grace our world forever. I was truly blown away by this film and have watched it dozens of times, always finding something new to appreciate.This film has something for everyone. Merida is a truly relatable character who strives to lead her own destiny and shatter the expectations that her mother and the rest of the world have for her. Her wild, untamable hair symbolizes her wild and carefree spirit. Her mother's tight braids symbolize her uptight personality, a complete contrast to Merida's.Brave is a groundbreaking Disney Princess Movie for several reasons. One, no romantic interest for the princess! Two, the mother is not only ALIVE but she is one of the focal points of the story for once! Three, there is arguably no ""true"" villain in this film. Mor'du is really more of an antagonist than an actual villain. You may say the true villain in this film that needs to be slain is conformity. And Merida succeeds! Four, Merida is the first Disney princess to have brothers. Five, Merida is the first princess to not have perfectly kempt hair! The visuals in this movie are absolutely stunning. It is more than just a movie, it is a truly thrilling experience. They really know just how to pull you in to the story and make you feel like you are a part of it. My favorite visuals were the little wisps, I thought those were really beautifully done. Elinor's transformation may seem a little silly at first but poetically and artistically it is VERY well done. You can accurately imagine the queen simultaneously with the bear. At least I could! I've seen some reviews complaining that Merida didn't sing and although I do love the musicals in Disney, this story line was so brilliant that I really didn't miss it.My favorite part in the movie is when Elinor and Merida are playing together in the stream. It shows how unbridled the queen is now in this ""wild"" state and she leaves her crown behind which symbolizes that she is purging a part of herself. In the end, Merida and Elinor both learn to be more like the other and finally mend their bond. This film will surely make you love your mother/daughter more and make you want to have a daughter if you don't already have one! In one word--AMAZING!!!",Brave

228,Sisiutil,A refreshing story in two main regards,9,26 December 2012,"I liked Brave a lot, for many different reasons (particularly the beautifully-done animation and spot-on performances), but for two in particular that set it apart from almost every other Hollywood movie made these days.First of all, it's a film that is primarily about a mother-daughter relationship. How often do we see those? Not often, certainly not in major motion pictures, animated or not. We see several father-son stories, occasionally a father-daughter story, but a story about a mom and her daughter? All too rare.Second, it's a story where the beautiful young princess does NOT, for a very refreshing change, wind up with a handsome prince at the end. That's right, not only is the beautiful princess the main character, there is no romantic plot or sub-plot. Again, something we don't see very often.I highly recommend Brave for families for this reason. Don't worry, despite what I've said the movie is not a feminist diatribe--it's a fun and touching romp, with plenty to amuse both boys and girls. But the sub-text is invaluable and all-too-rare in our culture.",Brave

This film receives a lot of criticism, and I can understand why. It doesn't feel like a Pixar film AT ALL. If it didn't have the Disney/Pixar logos at the beginning, it would've been an great movie from a different company. But, unfortunately, this will probably end up being bottom of the barrel Pixar (which isn't saying much considering Pixar is the best animation company to ever exist). I'm being very generous giving this a 4/5 star rating, it's just barely there. I thought this movie was pretty funny and enjoyable, however extremely strange in its decision making.

When I first saw it I completely regretted all the negative comments I said about it before even seeing it (I wanted Wreck-it Ralph to win).It has an excellent story and character development of the protagonists. I loved the character of Merida, as well as her parents, her brothers and probably everyone else too. The script doesn't stop being funny lighthearted and perfectly well done.Highly recommended to everyone, not just Disney fans (my father loved it and he doesn't usually see animated movies).

For me, while this is often a glaring detractor, I felt this movie still worked since Pixar knows how to handle such things. The movie isn't the masterpiece it could be, don't get me wrong. However, this doesn't mean it isn't a really great movie. I really enjoyed how much of the film focused on Merida and her mother. Unlike some of the other elements, I think mother/daughter relationships aren't explored enough in cinema. The visuals are absolutely fantastic.

235,ivern-326-711636,The Bear and the Bow Has Been Released!,8,20 September 2012,"Originally titled The Bear and the Bow, Brave is the latest Pixar movie. I had a lot of expectations for this movie, going into it. It was my most anticipated movie of the year. These are the criteria for a Pixar movie: 1. It needs to be funny for all ages. 2. It needs to have a good story. 3. It needs to have good characters. 4. It needs to have top-notch animation. 5. It needs to be heart-warming.Now let's see if Brave manages to meet with these criteria: 1. The movie's humor mostly consists of slapstick. If there's one thing we've learned from Looney Toons, it's that slapstick makes all ages laugh, from babies to old people. So Brave definitely succeeds in this aspect. While it mostly consists of physical humor (funny body language and people hitting each other in a funny way), it's still very funny. 2. Brave has a great story. It takes elements from past Disney movies, and puts them into one good fairy tale story with a good set-up, an unexpected plot twists and a happy ending. 3. The characters are a mixed bag. The family (the main character, her mother and father, and her little triplet brothers) are very good characters. The main character is one you want to vote for, the mother is a character you feel for but also disagree with (which is a great thing), the father is funny as hell and always makes you smile and the triplets are some of the greatest comic relief characters in Pixar (and maybe even Disney) history. But the rest of the characters aren't bad, but underdeveloped. But you don't mind them, in fact you want to see them on screen so you can know more about them. So Brave does succeed with the characters too. 4. Brave is definitely on my top 3 list of the best-looking animated movies of all time. Enough said. 5. While Brave doesn't reach the emotional standards that Up and Toy Story 3 have reached, it's still a sometimes tragic story that leaves you with a wonderful little finale.So the results are in (by the way, I think I'm gonna do this for every Pixar movie I review on IMDb): Criteria 1 = 7/10 Criteria 2 = 8/10 Criteria 3 = 7/10 Criteria 4 = 10/10 Criteria 5 = 8/10So overall, Brave is a worthy entry to the Pixar family, and ... wait here, I just have to do something real quick........ NO, CARS 2, YOU ARE NOT A RESPECTED FAMILY MEMBER, YOU CASH-CRAB! ....... OK, as I was saying: Brave is a great entry to the Pixar family and it seems that Pixar have returned to their glory.",Brave

We are expected to believe that Merida, the protagonist learned a lot from her time with her mother as a bear, however there wasn't a single scene in the entire movie that portrayed this in any form.

239,patrickwigington,Into the Woods,8,7 July 2012,"The latest Pixar film is surprisingly original and fun to watch. Unlike last year's sort of dud of Cars 2, this film has an interesting, fun, and mystical story that keeps the viewers entertained. Not only is Brave a lot of fun to watch, but it is also deep, meaningful, and touching.Young Merida is the princess of a kingdom in medieval Scotland, and a complete tomboy. She is the older sister of a set of mischievous, triplet brothers, she uses a bow and arrow better than most warriors, and she doesn't get along with her mother. The queen wants her daughter to act like a lady, and eventually decides to bring the other three kingdoms over, with the intention of marrying Merida off. However, the spunky red-haired daughter decides to visit a witch and change her fate. Of course this causes problems, and Merida must go on a journey of sorts to save her family.The plot structure is at times predictable, but that doesn't mean the film isn't original. The characters are all likable, funny, and complex. And the old fashioned fairy tale aspect is more than welcome. Many movies that have come out recently rely too much on the ""re-imagining"" of fairy tales and stories, but this one plays it straight, and benefits enormously from it. The woods outside the castle are filled with bears, witches, ancient structures, and spirits.The computer animated world is beautiful to look at, with rolling hills and a dark, ominous forest. The world is completely immersive; there is never a visual that seems out of place or unbelievable. Even the characters seem more detailed than in any previous Pixar film, most notably Merida's long, curly red hair, which is wonderful to look at.The film has some problems, including a few songs that play over montages, which are unnecessary and unwanted, and the third act almost becomes too predictable and tired, but by the end, the story picks itself back up again. Perhaps the sometimes awkward moments are a result of Brenda Chapman being fired from directing the film, and it being finished by Mark Andrews. Also, the film could have benefited from delving deeper into the mythology of creatures that live in the forest. The will-o-whisps are fine, but it would have been nice to have something a little more. Still, the film is a fun blockbuster that knows how to tell a good story, which is all I ask.http://thatguythatlikesmovies.blogspot.com/",Brave
240,FilmStallion,Brave...3 out of 4 Skittles,8,6 September 2012,"Brave is charming, funny, heart-warming and filled with excitement. Everything we've come to expect from a Pixar animated film. Built on their reputation from past classics Toy Story, Finding Nemo, Wall-E and Up, Pixar continues to prove that when it comes to great animated family filmsthere's Pixar.and then there's everyone else.Kelly Macdonald (Boardwalk Empire, No Country For Old Men) brings the lead character Merida to life with such likability and honesty that you tend to forget she is generated by a computer. Emma Thompson (Nanny McPhee, Men In Black 3) and Billy Connolly (The Last Samurai, The Boondock Saints) round out the lead voice characters providing a warm and truthful environment that help paint a portrait of realism and showcase why Merida is the young woman she's become.I can't rate Brave at the top of the modern masterpiece class with the likes of Up and Wall-E, but it is very good and definitely lives up to the Pixar standard. It's a family film that the entire family will actually enjoy.

Some of the Stoogie-esque slaptick is over done and the story is incredibly muddled, but kids will love it. Not a complete diasaster",Brave
242,Chanandler-Bong,Fab!,8,30 November 2012,"Brilliant film. Very touching and shows you how strong a mother and daughters bond can be. Beautiful animation and a fantastic story. Would recommend this for the whole family. It also had a great amount of humour in it! Only two things I felt were faults (one is me just being picky). The little blue lights, think they were called Whispers or something like that , they weren't very well explained. I didn't really know who they were. I think there were a few things that needed developing a bit more. Would have been nice to see the girl get married in the end too. Other than those few little development issues it was great. Soundtrack was wonderful. Loved the Mumford and Sons song at the end but would have loved it to be sung mainly by Mumford and Sons. I looked on YouTube because I couldn't remember the song and found it wasn't a song from their album but it sounds incredibly similar, almost identical, to one of their songs. But very glad they got to do a bit of soundtrack in there.",Brave

Yeah,this is a good fantasy tale with good characters but it doesn't feel quite like its a Pixar movie. Maybe because Pixar has mastered in perfection of animated movies and gave us masterpieces and unforgettable animated flicks. Visual effects are dazzling,colorful and over the top. Voice acting is strong and comedy element is as usual great. Characters are good but lack the development. What really lack is a script and wow moments. and there is one cheesy climax. I think studio must work on it hard and doesn't lost there touch with perfection. i really wanted to post that i love this movie i can't because i cannot overlook the negatives over positives.

245,evandewangga97,Three directors just make no sense,7,9 October 2013,"Yes, I agree with all the people who asked who is the brave character in ""Brave"". The character, however, is very weak yet not too clear. And the point of three directors is somehow not sharp. You know, first I'm about to think that this movie story is about a young and unstable girl. The next scene is not connected with early scene. The sense of movie is not obvious, that makes me confused.But, actually I still adore this movie. Although the story in my opinion is very bad. The ""impression thing"" of this movie is good. So, it is not boring, just nonsense. The good point is the message. I think for animation movie, it is a full of moral value movie. The message is easy to understand by children, so that they can learn life from this motion pictures. The role-play is funny and still good. At least, the technical section just bad and weak, but any other sections is just good and well- made.",Brave
246,Loving_Silence,A Visual Feast and a Solid Pixar Film,8,20 June 2012,"Brave is a beautiful and moving new fairy tale that fits seamlessly into the genre; Princess Merida is a wonderfully multi-facted heroine; the film shapes itself around problems that are familiar and understandable and will be well-understood and appreciated by kiddos and parents alike; the supporting characters that are given the most attention are well-crafted (but too bad for those others that fall by the wayside). The visual effects are flawless, in my opinion, the best if all Pixar films.Brave is at its best when it's smartly and charmingly changing what we think think a Disney Princess can be, but it wavers when it tries to somehow reinvent the Pixar wheel. The film lacks the trademark Pixar wit we've come to expect from the animation studio's productions, and some humor feels shoe-horned in for the sake of having some laughs; the directorial kerfuffle that took place in the middle of production is not overwhelmingly obvious, but there is a distinct laugh of singular vision driving the film and its tone wavers throughout. It may not live up to the incredible standards of the Pixar brand, but Brave offers young audiences a lot of entertainment and adventure. Highly Recommended.8/10",Brave
247,jeev7882,A Brave New Film From Pixar,7,24 June 2012,"There's quite a bit about Brave that has marked it as a departure from Pixar's typical fare. The most memorable trailer was one of the best scenes from the movie, with Merida protesting her marriage by shooting for her own hand. That scene alone showcases the detail and quality of animation we've come to expect from Pixar. No other studio has managed to come near what they do. The motion of the characters is natural. Merida's gorgeous curly red hair is distracting in its details only at the perfect times. And, most impressively, when Merida holds her breath to shoot her last arrow the audience holds its collective breath as we watch her arrow shoot away in slow motion and in a beautiful use of depth of field that reminds us why 2D is still highly preferred to 3D.That's not to say Brave is quite as visually astonishing as Sully's fur in Monsters Inc., the magical underwater world of Finding Nemo, or a landfill laden Earth in Wall-E. But, in some ways, it's not meant to be. We're dealing with a primarily human cast for once, and ones meant to look very different than the ones in Up.Beyond the animation, the story is somewhat flat. The trailers do an excellent job of concealing the twists, but the twists are all easy to see well ahead of time. The story revolves around Princess Merida who is continually at odds with her Mother, Elinor. At the center of their arguments: marriage. Merida is to be married to the first born of one of the leaders of the other three clans. She'll have none of it as she'd much rather ride off on her own and perfect her archery skills than sit at home and be a proper Princess. In her more childish qualities, she's like her father: an overgrown warrior child who also happens to be King. It's not a bad story, but it's certainly a little too basic. Most people will most likely find the lack of creativity in the script's details the biggest disappointment in Brave. There's no moments where we marvel ""how did these guys come up with this?"" It's a pity because Merida is one of the best protagonists Pixar has been blessed with. She's likable and hate-able in all the right ways. She has quite a bit of bratty teenager in her - as evidenced by the lack of morality she displays in trying to change her mother's mind about her upcoming betrothal - and yet heaps of bravery - as she shows when confronted with what she's done to her Mother. The best part about Merida and the story is that she's the one continually driving it forward and making the choices. That proves vital as the film doesn't really have a villain. This isn't a good vs. evil battle like all their other movies not named Finding Nemo.Brave falls somewhere in the middle for Pixar. It's great that it's original (especially with Pixar selling out and giving us Monster's Inc. 2 and Toy Story 4 shortly), it's great the protagonist is female and so well rounded, and it's great the animation is somewhat subdued for once. I can't help but feel that Brave lacks some of the magic and creativity that really separate the upper echelon of Pixar's best work from the rest of it. Of course, that'll still probably be enough to make it the best animated movie of the year.For more reviews like this one as well as other movie musings, go to http://thethreeacts.wordpress.com/",Brave
248,tyreeewebster,Retrospective Reviews- Brave (2012),7,2 January 2013,"From the Creators of 'Toy Story' comes the mediocre, but heartfelt 'Brave.'PROS: As always, Pixar's animation is gorgeous and draws you in to the Scottish landscapes (even if you don't really get to enjoy them). The land in created to the finest detail, and it's the exact thing I expected from the animation Gods! The character of Merida is both funny and engaging, she is a well written character who you like and hope to see her story come full circle. The other characters, such as King Fergus and Queen Elinor are good, too. Those 3 characters actually get most of the funny lines and situations. As always, the animation and characters are the highlight of the film, but the downside is Pixar's best quality... the story.CONS: The story, I think, should have gone on for far much longer, the trailers and promotional material promised us a huge, epic quest with stunning visuals but what did we get? A small hike outside of the castle, and then the same hike back. I was greatly disappointed with this film's story and lack of heart. Let me remind you that this is from the creative minds that did an entire film about a rat who wanted to be a chef in a 5 star restaurant. WHAT HAPPENED? I'm ranting too much. To make a long story short (like this one) this film isn't Pixar's best, but I'm looking forward to see if they can improve with 'Monster's University.'Directed by: Brenda Chapman & Mark AndrewsWritten by: Mark Andrews, Steve Purcell, Brenda Chapman & Irene MecchiStarring: Kelly MacDonald, Julie Walters, Billy Connolly, Emma Thompson, Kevin McKidd, Craig Ferguson & Robbie Coltrane",Brave
249,mrshev,A Celtic Departure for Pixar,8,17 November 2012,"I kind of missed all the marketing hullabaloo when this was in the cinema and so watched this hype free, with my kids, curled up on the sofa eating popcorn. As ever the animation is sumptuous and Pixar really are peerless when it comes to this kind of stuff but I don't think it has escaped their - or our - notice that all the other animation studios have caught up in that department; is it any better that How to Train Your Dragon? Or Tangled? I do wonder...the hair is great, the Highland setting is detailed in a way that that shows utter dedication to one's craft. I still think Pixar are at the top of the league, though.The thing, however, that defines a Pixar movie for me is that the animation is almost secondary to the dialogue, characters and plot. I liked it. I thought the characters were clearly defined and funny, beautifully designed with superb voice acting. My kids sometimes got a touch lost with the plot (I found myself scratching my head a couple of times to be honest) but overall they adored the story and got swept up in the final third of the film.This is not one of Pixar's best movies - it's a bit of a Ratatouille (which I love BTW) in that it seems to struggle to play to both audiences, to adults and children alike. My kids loved it and I really liked it as well. Would I see it again? Yeah, I probably would, but there is a certain something missing from this movie and I think that it is a bit of emotion. I didn't fall in love with any of the characters like Woody...or Wall-E...or grouchy Mr Fredricksen. There is a tiny spark of Pixar magic missing from this film...but it's still a great film",Brave

Really funny movie as well which is very Scottish which does make me feel like home.One of my favourite Disney movies,Brave

Seems like he followed the high cliffs and cheered.",Brave
252,martinmcdonough,Bad. Absolutely dreadful.,3,11 February 2013,"There are many descriptive adjectives that can be used to describe this movie. Some of them that I would choose are: stereotypical; boorish; clichéd; pandering; far fetched; unimaginative; dreck.Movies of this ilk have very little grounding in reality and a healthy dose of fantasy, and that is to be expected. But in any movie, there has to be - there HAS to be - period accurate character depictions to create the illusion of believability, even in it's most remote form. You wouldn't expect King George III to speak ebonics, nor would you expect Ice-T to quote Shakespeare perfectly in the Queen's English.I think it is safe to say that movie makers in general cling to the falsehood that ALL medieval male Scots were nothing more than brutish, kilt-wearing, ale-swilling, axe wielding ogres who spoke with thick and unintelligible brogues, while the women were fair, red haired and blue eyed maidens and ladies in waiting - and ANY deviance from those molds is not to be expected. This movie is no different. Add to this that the teenager is a rebellious sort (and suffers from typical ""my mother doesn't understand me"" syndrome) and, well, we can see that this 90+ minute crusade will end in a manner that is so formulaic it could have spewed from the powerbook of the laziest Hollywood hack.I'll sum it up: Mom has expectations for daughter. Daughter hates mom for it and rebells. Mother and daughter fight. Daughter does something she regrets. They go on a soul searching journey. Daughter loves mother. Mother and daughter reconcile. We all live happily ever after. Sound about right? Fair or unfair, believable or unbelievable, in the day and setting of this movie, girls simply did not rebel in the manner depicted in this movie. Plain and simple. This ""90210"" teenage drama mentality simply did not exist to the extent that this film would have you believe. This storyline would have been better suited to 1990 and not 1190.Put all of these elements together, add a pinch of medieval witchcraft and - poof - you have a movie. Oh, and don't forget the comic relief that, in this movie, comes in the form of triplet little brothers instead of a cute, cuddly talking animal voiced by the comedian-of-the-month.The only good thing about this movie was the fact that I rented it for $2 and didn't pay full price for my family to see it at the theatre. Given the choice, I'd rather waste $2 than $50. If you miss it, you aren't missing much.",Brave
253,Simarium,Brave,5,2 August 2018,"Very mediocre movie with a cute protagonist and a pretty generic, uninspired plot.

254,TinyDanseur27,The plot was a bit silly but overall Brave was wonderful!,9,21 June 2013,"Brave was adorable. The Scottish accents were a bit over the top to be sure; I found myself imitating Merida, the main character for many hours after the conclusion of the film. I enjoyed that about it though. It's nice to see a Disney film that not only has a strong, independent female heroine, but also has one that comes from ancient Scotland, the home of many of my ancestors.As with most of the modern Disney films, Brave had a very specific message it was trying to convey. It was a good message, basically to love your family as they are; you can't change them. In conveying this message though, the conflict of the film was a little silly I thought. I had to remind myself that it was a children's movie. Merida accidentally turns her mother into a bear. Of all the things... So silly. It definitely got the point across though, so I say it was a success. And the whole Scottish aspect made it utterly enjoyable to me, despite the many historical flaws in the film. I give this film a thumbs up.",Brave
255,MildInconvenienceMan,"Okay, but not up to Pixar's usual standard in terms of story.",5,10 October 2012,"I felt this movie undermined its message, which was that the main character didn't need to be feminine and could 'choose her own fate' only to have the thing which stopped her form marriage being acting like her mother and by using her feminine charm, undermining the pint in the movie.Some of the minor characters such as the three brothers were underused, and therefore should have been cut completely as they added little to the story, or given a more prominent role. There were many plot holes, such as the fact that no one realised any of the royal family were missing until two days later when they checked the queens room, little bit odd. But the cherry on the cake had to be the fact that the evil bear that was living in the castle, who was one of the original kings was somehow still alive even thought the story of him was a 'legend' implying that it was really old and that people weren't sure if it was true. Another small annoyance thats not that big is the fact that the queens crown is still somewhere out in the woods just sitting there.... maybe a terrible sequel idea that Pixar have in mind, if so I pray for all those who watch that film.Apart from this it was okay, it didn't really have the charm that other Pixar films have, but loved the graphics, especially in the princesses hair (top notch).Okay but not up to Pixar's usual standard in terms of story.",Brave
256,Kane20,Review - Brave,9,15 December 2012,"My Rating: ***1/2 (out of ****)Over its years, Pixar has brought its magic of high quality animation and good storytelling to the screen. Some of their films are better than others, but I've at least liked, or even loved, all of their films to date. I even found Cars 2 to be okay, even though it's my least favorite Pixar film. This summer I went to theater to see Brave, Pixar's thirteenth major feature film. I was a bit worried due to a lot of the negative criticism surrounding the film, but I ended up enjoying it. I also saw it again recently on DVD. I've already written a review for this film, but I've decided to re-write it now that I've had a couple additional viewings of the film.Brave is the story of Merida, a young red-haired princess and aspiring archer who is unhappy with her controlled and restricted life. When she is asked by her mother, Queen Elinor, to choose between three possible suitors from three other clans, she is even more upset, and, after a spat with her mother, she eventually flees into the woods, and soon comes upon a cottage (led there by magical blue willo-the-wisps), where she meets a witch. She begs for a magic spell to change her mother's mind, but it doesn't exactly go according to how Merida wants it...and problems ensue...I was a bit worried that I would like the movie on DVD less than I did on the big screen, but I ended up enjoying it just as much as I did before, and I still stand by my three-and-a-half (out of four) star rating. Brave is not without problems, but I can tell that the filmmakers really put in a good amount of effort to try and make the film work for what it's worth. The film's flaws are mostly forgivable and, while they do hold the film back from living up to its potential, they do not spoil the film.The story is not original or creative, and it's somewhat clichéd and predictable in areas. But the film does contain a lot of uniqueness, both visually and story-wise. What I liked most about the film was Merida herself, whom I found to be an interesting, complex, and charismatic character. She may be a princess, and yes, in a Disney movie, but she's not your average Disney princess. She's not the kind of princess who falls in love with a prince on a white steed. She is spunky, strong-willed, and independent, and she has bright, wild red hair that matches her personality. I fell in love with her, and I genuinely cared about her and even related to her a bit, and I stuck with her and got emotionally involved throughout the film. I even thought she was cute in terms of physical appearance, especially her hair. And Kelly MacDonald further helps to bring this feisty lass to life with a great voice performance with a cute Scottish accent.I enjoyed the dynamic relationship between her and her mother, and the bonding they undergo. Again, this is not a romance film. Instead, it concerns more personal and more relatable themes (in my opinion); family values and relationships, personal decisions, controlling one's own fate (deciding your own path in life), admitting one's mistakes, and some other valuable and life lessons. I especially liked the mother-daughter aspect. I myself am a 20 year old guy, but I still related to Merida and her relationship with her mother. While it may not be a romance film, it's definitely a film about love.The animation in this film is stunningly beautiful and helps bring the film to life. The Scottish landscape, the characters, Merida's hair, the wisps, and everything else in the film is all excellently animated. Sound-wise the film is very good too, both music and other effects. Composer Patrick Doyle, who was responsible for the score in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, composed a great score for this film. I think the film could have used some more (and better) humor, but it did have its humorous moments as it is. It also handles its more emotional areas well, if you ask me.I feel that there are some things in the film that are meant to be felt rather than explained, and a few of these are meant to be a bit mysterious and open-ended. The film somewhat succeeds at these, but unfortunately it stumbles a bit here. I feel that the filmmakers overreached a bit in these areas. As a result some of these things didn't have the full effect they were supposed to have, and some of them felt a bit out of place. Yes, the movie felt a bit uneven and unpolished in some areas, and even bit compressed and rushed in a few.I honestly think the film could have benefited from a longer running length, with which the film could have improved some things, including, but not limited to, fleshing out the characters more, explaining some things better, and polishing up some plot elements. Also, it would have allowed the mysterious and open-ended feeling be established properly, with an appropriate balance between the things that are explained and those that are meant to be felt. Another criticism (more minor, though) I have is that the film could have used a bit more thought towards character development; the characters are all effective, and some of them memorable (especially Merida), but except for Merida and Elinor, the characters are a bit underdeveloped.However, despite these shortcomings, and a few more, I enjoyed the movie; I thought it was handled pretty well, even the weaker areas. Brave is a bit flawed, and it's definitely not Pixar's best, but I found it be a good movie overall; it's cute, charming, heartwarming, funny in areas, visually stunning, and undeserving of the negativity it receives.",Brave
257,khfan250,Pixar's Official Apology for Cars 2.,8,25 June 2012,"I've been a big Pixar fan since the beginning. Sure, not all of their films were great. But, even at their lowest, their was always something good found in any Pixar movie. And then that fateful day came. June 24, 2011 saw the release of ""Cars 2"", a sequel that no one wanted to see. The first ""Cars"" was fine, but I think that it's universally accepted that it's definitely not a Pixar gem. That said, the sequel was awful. Sure, it continued the streak of opening #1 at the box office, but critics and audiences really ripped this sequel a new one. The people at Pixar needed a movie to get audiences back in the theater seats and loving them again. And ""Brave"" is the first Pixar movie to indulge in what their corporate partner, Disney, has been doing in the majority of their animated films: a fairy tale. So, is ""Brave"" good? There's some good things in it. Firstly, the animation is stellar, but I think that's the case with every Pixar movie. The backgrounds are so detailed and the colors are mesmerizing. The characters are actually pretty good, too. Merida is the first female lead in a Pixar movie, played by Kelly Macdonald. At times she's a bit too whiny, but I have to admit that I have a soft spot for any defiant character in a movie. The mom and dad, played by Emma Thompson and Billy Connolly, are very likable and have a strong, some-what damaged relationship with their daughter. There's also a pair of triplets that almost make the movie. Their expressions are priceless and they provide the biggest laughs in the movie.The rest of the supporting cast kind of falls flat. In the other Pixar movies, the supporting characters are given just as much personality and jokes as the main protagonists. A prime example is ""Toy Story""; I remember Ham, Rex, and Mr. Potato Head just as much as I do Woody and Buzz. Here, we never get enough screen time with our supporting cast to really be invested in them. A part of me really likes the fact that Pixar is doing their own take on a fairy tale. I guess I'm just kind of let down by the fact that they didn't bring anything new to the table. I admit that it's difficult to do new things to a formula that's been done to death, but I think Pixar could have done something really spectacular here. They were probably just playing it safe after the disaster that was ""Cars 2"".Final verdict: Though definitely not Pixar's strongest film, ""Brave"" is still a delightful treat. The fact that's it's this good fills me with hope that Pixar will return to it's high form of storytelling and animation. It's a good idea to rush to your local cinema and give it a watch.",Brave
258,gerumghl,Simple Tale,3,14 May 2018,"As a movie, this is alright. But it's just very simple and doesn't really do anything. This movie could've been summed up in about 20 minutes without all the unhilarious jokes.The animation is a big complaint, yeah. Disney has a reputation of great and clean animation. They team up with Pixar for many franchises you know (their cleanest studio for this stuff), but this is Walt Disney. And those movies are also good. This was kind of bad for a Pixar standard around the time. he movements looked choppy at times and the characters look like dolls. Not much texture was put in to it. And then, the whole color tone of the movie was just a dark gray smoky tone.The story is a retelling. A retelling of ""A girl asks a witch to cure her life, but it hurts her instead."" There's many versions of this kind of thing. So nothing special, her mother just turns into a bear, how original. So then the movie tried to make a Brother Bear theme trying to ""bond"" and stuff. Just very boring. Nothing grand was explored, and it definitely didn't give justice to the Scottish culture they tried to use.Instead of making it grand like they hyped it up to be, we get a one dimensional story. The girl never showed her skills for any real fight. She's always teased throughout the movie as a skilled fighter and archer, yet at the end she doesn't show it off. The story just goes of the curse she's trying to heal. There's nothing ""brave"" about this. It's just another copy and paste story.Oh, and I don't hate jokes that much, but was this terrible with it. It's the biggest disappointment i humor. The three brothers were honestly annoying and the three kingdoms coming made no sense. They added ANOTHER plot with this reverse the curse plot which made it worse. So of course they just made the three kingdoms plot to make them for humor, and focused more on the reverse curse.This wasn't good in a fresh sense, and the reverse cursing thing they tried to teach was alright. It wasn't grand with anything they tried to do (like the three kingdoms not helping with any of the plot or the souls which made the protagonist less brave). I don't think this just had a right mindset of how to handle this.",Brave
259,IllusionOfLife,Best Disney-Branded Fairy Tale Since Beauty and the Beast,9,23 June 2012,"While Pixar has had many many many fantastic successes, and nearly every movie they've made has been a bonafide masterpiece, it seems like most people, critics especially, tend to view the three movies Pixar released from 2007-2009 as being the best in their 26 year, 13 feature history. Those movies were Ratatouille, WALLE, and Up; and they each featured high concept stories, deep and sophisticated themes, and, in many ways, spoke more to the grown-ups in the audience than they did to the kids while still being great movies for the entire family to enjoy together. These three films, which are arguably as close to perfect as any movie has ever come, combined with Pixar's nearly spotless history, unfortunately may have set the bar so high that no one, not even Pixar could ever hope to top it.That brings us to Brave. Let me just be upfront in saying that Brave is a *really* good movie. It has fantastic and fully realized characters, it has a strong emotional core, it has great performances, it looks stunning, and it has an absolutely beautiful soundtrack. The story is set in a mythical version of Scotland, where Princess Merida is about to be betrothed to the first born son of one of the three other Lords of the kingdom, however, Merida is not ready for marriage and, in fact, would much rather be free to make her own way in the world than be bound by the traditions of her kingdom. After a heated argument with her mother she flees the kingdom and happens upon a witch who gives her a spell that will allow her to change her fate.If a lot of this sounds familiar (and not just from the trailers of the film) you shouldn't be surprised as this essential formula is the basis to more fairy tales than you could count. However, where Brave succeeds is not in the creation of groundbreaking new ideas, but rather in the execution of telling a very classic story and bringing a new and fresh voice to it, much in the same way Disney did back in 1989 and 1991 with The Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast. Unlike many fairy tales of recent years, it does not rely on the conventions of the ""Disney Fairy Tale Musical"" as a crutch, but instead finds a way to make it uniquely their own.Pixar has always had a knack for creating incredibly endearing and heartfelt characters who, despite being animated, feel just as alive as any other person in the theater, and Brave is certainly no exception. The leap from Belle to Merida is just as significant as the leap from Princess Aurora (Sleeping Beauty) to Ariel. She's a character that I think will resonate not just with young girls, but with many women, especially the ones that are at the threshold of adulthood, and the relationship between her and her mother is very poignant.The story itself doesn't break any new ground, and if you've ever seen a fairy tale movie before you can call just about every plot beat a few minutes before they arrive, but that doesn't make the film any less effective because the execution is so spot-on. For the same reason you cry when the Beast dies despite the knowledge that, of course, he's going to come back to life you also are completely involved with the emotions and characters of Brave even though you probably already know how it's all going to turn out.Despite all this, the fact that this isn't an absolute revolution in cinematic history means that it won't live up to the ""Pixar legacy"" in many people's minds. I, however, have always considered Pixar's legacy to be more about the emphasis on characters and honest emotions than about breaking new ground and doing the unexpected. Sure, that's an important part of what's made many of their past successes great, but in my book that is still secondary to simply telling a solid story with great characters and sincere emotions, and with perhaps the exception of Cars 2, Pixar has never once forsaken that legacy. It may not be the best movie Pixar has ever made, but Brave is still a great film, and in my opinion the best fairy tale that Disney has put their name on since 1991.A-",Brave

Well this movie will definitely prove them wrong. This movie was a visually stunning masterpiece with a great story. Even before the movie started it was exciting because of the unique and creative short La Luna along with the Monsters University teaser trailer.

262,JBingeWatcher,"Good idea, not good enough",7,1 December 2020,"Brave is a movie that works better as concept. The story of a daughter and mother who misunderstand each other about life really has a big heart! It really got me in the feelings until the end. As watcher you understand the problem and it's a daily problem everyone can relate to.But it has a big problem with the execution. Why had the mother become a bear? I seriously don't like that! The story could be told without that. I have not enough knowledge about the Scottish culture to tell if the bear element is done because of that, but I still don't like that.In the end, Brave is my favorite Pixar and even my favorite Disney Studios animated movie! It got the interesting storytelling and animation from Pixar and mixed it with a classical Disney feeling.",Brave

Then she starts seeing fairies in the forest. Oh OK...I thought it was going to be somewhat down-to-earth but now it's supernatural. Maybe it'll still be good. What, now there's freaking cauldrons and witches? This movie is starting to go downhill... Oh no, now the mother turns into a bear? What has this got to do with archery and Scottish highlands? Now nobody believes that the bear is the mother and hunts her down? Oh geez this is just Disney crap rehashed.In between scenes of the bear in the forest, all you get are people standing around talking long-winded conversations about heirs to the throne.

264,Edd-N-Furter,Prince not required,9,4 January 2015,"The canon of Disney princesses has offered us over the years iconic characters such as Snow White, Cinderella, Ariel and Aurora, which nevertheless suffer a mild ""problem"": they teach us that happiness depends on a prince who comes to rescue. Times have changed and apparently Disney has begun to understand this, introducing gradually female characters able to see beyond a ""And they lived happily ever after.""An example of this is Merida, daughter of kings Fergus and Elinor, who must marry one of the heirs of the kingdoms that are part of the great kingdom of Dubroch in order to preserve the alliances; however there is one small detail: Merida refuses the idea of an arranged marriage, which leads her to confront her mother, who insists on keeping the tradition by educating and preparing Merida to assume her role as Queen in the future (and Merida, of course also opposes to this). The clash between the two is inevitable and in the midst of her despair Merida meets (by chance or fate perhaps?) a witch to which she asks for a spell to make change her mother. The problem is that the spell ends up being too literal and Elinor turns into a bear. With the witch gone, Merida along with her triplets brothers must reverse the spell before Elinor becomes a bear forever.With characters like Mulan or Giselle from Enchanted, Disney had already begun to give a twist to the stories of princesses, but with Tiana from The Princess and the Frog and now Merida (in collaboration with Pixar) leads to a new stage in which the female central characters look for personal fulfillment instead of finding a man that will provide a happy future. At the same time keeps them away from the ""submissive woman"" role model seen in the media for decades; in Brave, Merida is a girl with a strong and determined character who enjoys her freedom, and she's willing to take the necessary risks to correct her mistakes.Another key element for this movie work is the mother/daughter relationship, which is an unexplored factor in previous Disney movies (as most of their characters are orphaned or taken away from their family environment). The constant friction between Merida and Elinor is a reflection of the need for communication between parents and children and how the lack of understanding can force to take wrong decisions.It has been questioned whether Merida's reluctance to marriage reflects a suggestive comment about her sexual identity, but that's not necessarily part of the central idea of the film, although it is an indication that the audiences begin to look for stories they can feel more identified with. On the technical level, there's nothing to complain about, which is understandable considering the very high visual level that Pixar keeps in all of their movies, and the recreation of the scenarios of medieval Scotland is extraordinary. And last but not least, it's required to highlight the vocal work of Kelly McDonald as Merida, who gives her a unique vitality and energy, Oscar winner Emma Thompson as Queen Elinor, serene, proud and with a strong temper and Billy Connolly as King Fergus. On the other hand, the masterful score courtesy of Patrick Doyle, who makes use of classic Scottish musical instruments and captures the essence of their sound away from the cliché and with a highly emotional charge.Brave is a clear sign that times change and while Prince Charming can remain as an ideal for many women, in fact he's not so indispensable anymore.",Brave
265,ginobean,"excellent animation, but muddled and mediocre story",4,27 February 2013,"Frankly, I'm shocked that this won the Oscar for best animated feature or was even nominated. The story was fairly muddled and mediocre. Part of it involves the Queen forcing her daughter to marry against her will. To me this is a no brainer -- when you force someone to marry against their will, you're basically creating an untenable situation for them. It's not rocket science.. And it all goes downhill from there. When you put someone into this type of situation, it isn't called love, it's called imprisonment. At this point, I felt antipathy for the Queen and thought she was being totally unreasonable. The graphics and animation are excellent, but for some reason, I found it hard to really get into the story much at all. Maybe because the story was such a yawner -- it wasn't that interesting or compelling.If I were to grade the story on a letter scale (A-F), I would give it a D.

After the first hour, I stood felt in the introduction. In fact it was near the end of the main story. We passed the entire movie go out and get back to the castle.The first 30 min are awesome, the characters are lovable, the father specifically, the animation very well done, Scottish accent, and environment. Everything was in place for a great tale. Instead we assist, again, of the urges of a selfish young princess who ""want to go out and feel the wind into her hairs"" pressed by her mother to find an husband and act like a princess. We heard that story a million times, thanks to Disney. But where the story could have told us a great adventure, it slip to a weird , awkward story. I know that its intended for kids, but Pixar always had multiple layers to their plot. In this one, its black and white, This is bad, this is good, and this is the lesson you kids should learn from this. Unlike ""Up"", ""Wal-e"", ""Nemo"", there is no layer, no subtlety, no real twist just a poor story too well animated. I admit, I laughed a few times, the characters are funny, some facial expression are well stereotyped, but no genius humor like Pixar used to think of. This movie is, by far, the worst of Pixar. And all the fault goes to the plot because everything else was in place to deliver something great: character, animation, world, voice acting.",Brave

The greatest thing about this flick, however, is the characters, especially that of our main protagonist, Merida. They were not just one-note characters, they were given personalities and realistic qualities that define human beings. You find yourself caring for each of them throughout the movie, and this is thanks to the voice actors. Their voices brought life to this production in a way that did not seem at all forced or dull. The problem lies more with the scenes where Merida changed the Queen and tried to make up for it. These scenes have their moments, but for some reason, they seem to drag, and you find yourself guessing what's going to happen much of the time. The story picks up more often than not, but it does tend to go off the beaten path in a way that can distract, but not in a real positive light.Still, overall, the movie does not disappoint. It is not a masterpiece, but it is definitely not one that you should pass up.

270,miruleyall,"Braveheart for kids, doesn't really feel like a pixar movie, more like a Disney flick.",6,17 June 2012,"I might as well make it quite clear that i am a huge pixar fan and have lost count of how many times I've seen their movies and shorts... up till Cars 2.Brave is one of those films that has a impact upon the animation genre, the problem is its not a very big one, especially when we remember what Toy Story did for the 3d CGI animated movie genre, Brave is more evolutionary than revolutionary, which isn't a bad thing, just slightly disappointing.The Animation, characters, style and 3d are all fantastic and a massive step up from their last films what its what we have come to expect from pixar and they have mastered the Celtic style and location perfectly, even the lighting and mood is spot on, the problem is the story and what a shame that is because its mostly solid with some slow dragging parts in the middle.Its more like Toy Story 2 compared to TS1/TS3 its good but not great, adults will find little to occupy themselves in the middle in act 2.fortunately Act 1 and 3/4 are great, the problem is with the pacing of the middle part of the movie, a problem pixar faced with cars 2 and to a lesser extent cars 1.Obviously kids will love this movie but even they might have trouble with the middle part of this movie because the pacing drops right off, but it picks up again quick enough.Onto the rest of the movie, there's a lot of great Scottish and Celtic gags which should not rustle too many kilts.The theme is also a great idea mostly executed very nice, although its a bit predictable Pixar have mixed things up enough for it to still be interesting, basically its a coming of age drama with some fun supernatural, highlander and old school slapstick thrown in, its all very well put together and very enjoyable, is the experience deep? In parts yes, but not in the middle (hence why this movie is only getting average scores) If i could compare this movie to something else thats similar i would say its like Tangled crossed with Mulan, which are both fantastic Disney movies.now onto the controversial part the breaking/mixing of gender roles and stereotypes in this movie are not a problem, i am a male and i liked how the characters where portrayed, but it feels too... safe, i guess pixar didn't want a pg-13 rating which is understandable since they make most there money from kids toys and viewers BUT i did feel like they cut a lot out (the directors admitted it too for the interest of time and rating) hopefully the directors cut will give us more adult content.Its not often a pixar movie feels short and rushed, this one did.I give it 8 red heads out of 10 - needed more spark and less fizzlethis is not one of those movies which i could easily re watch again in 3D either.On a whole this is a very solid movie, just don't expect Toy Story 3 or Wall-e and personally i recommend the 2D version as the 3D version isn't worth the extra money and if you struggle with 3d movies 2 hours is a long time.If you feel the same way about brave, don't worry, there are still some excellent animated movies to come out, Wreck it Ralph by Disney's own animation studious also looks fantastic.",Brave

We need to look deep into ourselves and search for it. Bravery is also shown by adapting to every situation and not thinking about your failures and learning from your mistakes.The lines above summarize the story of Disney's latest cartoon adventure movie ""Brave"". The story revolves around Merida who is proud of her archery prowess. However, Merida's mother is sure to make her daughter aware of her worldly duties as the King's daughter. This often becomes a hindrance to a girl who loves to be free and fly like a bird. That is why she even refuses to marry.Merida is angry over her mother's attitude towards her. She feels that her mother is stealing away her life from her. Merida wishes that her mother will lose against her, be forced to change her thought and stop forcing her for marriage. Things take a wrong turn when her wishes are granted and her mother is transformed into something un""bear""able. Now it is up to her to fight the evil curse and bring her mother back to normal.The story belongs to every girl of the middle class society. However, credibility lies in the fact that a normal being's story has been shown with such child-like innocence. The relationship between Merida and her mother is heartwarming and very real. You might find the film to be a drag at first, however it gradually gathers pace. The USP of the movie is the climax which is unexpected and very soothing.Pixar has given many 3D movies and this one excels all. The characters are cute throughout.

There were 3 times when I got tears in my eyes and I looked over and my mom had them too. If you've ever made mistakes as a mother or a daughter it will get you too, for sure. There were a couple times that my girls (5 and 7) got scared but it wasn't nearly as bad as the Lion King (they still refuse to watch that one again). They were over it quickly after the scene was over. My mom just told them ""it's just a movie and in movies everything always ends up OK"" which satisfied them).

277,ShaShank_MovieFreak,A Great Movie.. But not 'Pixar' Great...,9,22 June 2012,"I am a great fan of Pixar studios, so I'm trying to be as unbiased as I can while writing this review. Brave sure does mark a comeback to Pixar. After Cars 2, many thought that the beloved animation studio lost its vibe and magic, but this movie proves everyone wrong. I mean it. Pixar is back. But... The movie is not extra-ordinary or marvelous like Up or Wall-e. Its great, but not in a 'Pixar' kind of way. But then again, the movie is much different from the usual Pixar style of movie-making, which might be the reason why I made the previous point.Firstly, the visuals. I mean, come on, no one beats Pixar when it comes to Animation and visual effects. And this time, the studio has really outdone itself. Brave should probably be the greatest animation work of Pixar up to date. The Characters, the ancient Scotland, the Artwork, the Scenery, you name it. It was splendid. Even the voices were perfectly cast. Kelly McDonald was very convincing as Merida and so was the case with everyone else. Also, I loved the way she spoke in her Scottish accent.Talking about the story, it sounded more like a Disney story than a Pixar one. It was, of course, the darkest Pixar tale so far and even the jokes got a little matured this time around. And I have to say this, though. The message the movie gives about freedom and family was very good. You may not actually appreciate it and get impressed as soon as you see it but once you see the movie and after a while you think of it, you'll start liking it. It did happen to me.I only have a few things against the movie, the first one being that the studio didn't reach its previous standards of story-telling. The second one was the pace, which was alright for most of the movie except for at the beginning of the second half. Also, I must have raised my expectations dramatically after watching the trailers, so probably I did get a little disappointed. But nevertheless, the movie is without doubt, a very good movie. Only, it's neither the best nor the worst of Pixar films. It dangles somewhere in the middle of the list.Also, there was a very beautiful short movie called La Luna at the beginning of the movie. By the way, 'If you had the chance to change you fate, would you?' This line is kind of cool. Who knew? You might find it useful someday.",Brave

It all started last year with Cars 2, a film that had gorgeous animation, but had a bland story, little character development, and should have been called Mater's Big Movie. There was too much Mater. This time around we got a film that seemed new and creative except for one thing: This is a princess movie! It's not an original film! I'm officially saying this: Dreamworks has surpassed Pixar as the best animation studio in America!This movie is essentially Disney princess movie ever made, except now it's in medieval Scotland. It tells the story of Merida, a red-headed princess (does Ariel ring a bell?) who wishes to go out and have adventures (just about every Disney princess in that category), and change her fate (wow, Pixar, have you really run out of ideas?). Merida doesn't want to follow tradition, so she shows off her archery skills, upsets her mother, changes her fate, and nearly tears the kingdom apart, all the while going up against an evil black bear that happens to be the worst Pixar villain to date. The film has gorgeous animation, but I still think The Pirates! Band of Misfits was a better animated film. The story is okay, but it's the same story we've seen a dozen or more times from Disney. Sure, some characters are really funny, but the main heroine comes across as an unlikable brat, and even by the end I still didn't like her. Pixar, you can make good movies, but in the future, stop making sequels, or prequels, or unoriginal films! This is two in a row, you used to be perfect!

281,jsteiger,"Not only Disappointing, but also strangely racist",4,21 November 2012,"I watched the 3D version of this film. The positives are limited, so I'll get to them first. The visuals were absolutely gorgeous in places, and the 3D effects convincing yet not obtrusive.Now for the sad reality.Given what we have come to expect from Pixar, this film came up short in several respects. The essential problem is that a number of previous Pixar efforts have excelled not only in the technical realm, but also in terms of characterization and emotional power. They keep you glued to the screen from start to finish. By contrast, this film is jumbled, lacks character depth, and is ultimately actually boring. So while Toy Story 3 is both beautiful, touching, and deep, this movie is simply passable. It fails to consistently hold one's interest.There is one more annoying aspect of it that has become so omnipresent in our culture that it might go right over the heads of the typical denizen of the modern university Arts Faculty, let alone the typical viewer, so I'll take pains to point it out. The primary characters are all Scots -- an itentifiable minority group in our society. Is this group treated with respect? Hardly! All the (white) male characters are portrayed as imps or hulking buffoons or simpletons. This in fact mirrors what one often sees in a random assortment of modern TV ads. The only attractive characters are women or animals.Had any identifiable non-white ""minority"" group received similar treatment, Harvard's English faculty would already be hard at work ""deconstructing"" the work as racist. Watching this film, only the culturally aware viewer can articulate what feels so vaguely discomforting and wrong.In fact, our culture is now so imbued with anti-white-male racism that one quickly realizes that the ""humour"" in the movie simply wouldn't work (at all!) if the film had been made about a black African family and the sexes reversed. Suppose, for example the film was made about a young tribe in Africa, with a massive, hulking, rather dumb *matriarch*, three moronic and unattractive females as ""potential brides"" for a handsome young prince, and a host of equally inept female supporting characters. It wouldn't work! Now do you get it? It is hard to see at first, but it is simply a fact that this kind of propaganda is an intentional element of much of our modern media. White males are portrayed, relentlessly, as idiots and buffoons, or, alternatively, robotic male model heroes. Learn to see it, and don't support it. Let the producers know -- we want balance in our movies and in our culture, and we are prepared to vote with our wallets.And don't be deterred by the standard retorts that ""white males control everything,"" and ""why don't you get a sense of humour."" Look where ""tolerance"" has gotten us over the past 20 years.",Brave

Unfortunately, this spell changes her mother, Queen Elinor, into a bear and Merida, realizing her mistake, must find a way to undo the curse before the kingdom destroys the DunBroch and before the second sunrise of the spell. This film is Pixar's first film with a female protagonist and its fairy tale, but it focuses more on the mother-daughter relationship, as opposed to romance from previous fairy tales. The three lords: Macintosh, Dingwall and MacGuffin play comic relief in this film, as their sons compete for Merida's hand in marriage. Merida's young triplet brothers also provide comic relief, constantly stealing cakes from the maid and the triplets themselves being turned into bear cubs.The animation and effects (particularly on the will-o'-the-wisps) are very well done, the music by Scottish composer Patrick Doyle is exciting and uplifting and the voice cast, including Kelly Macdonald, Billy Connolly, British actress Emma Thompson, etc. Is all authentically Scottish. This film is so detailed in its depiction of medieval Scotland in the 10th century that Pixar had to upgrade its animation system in order to depict the realism of the trees, clothing and the castle. Directors Mark Andrews and Brenda Chapman really ought to be given credit for this majestic piece of work, but this is essentially Chapman's movie from beginning to end. She originally developed this movie based on raising her feisty and rebellious daughter. Strangely enough, this movie also contains body humor, just like in the Shrek movies, but this humor is kept to a minimum in this movie. ""Brave"" is a very thoughtful and interesting fairy tale movie that adds its own unique twist to the fairy tales of long ago.",Brave
283,funnycc,so so,8,24 June 2020,"From the point of view of the plot, it should be a relatively simple and easy-to-understand story. The plot is very compact and there are a lot of laughs. The whole process of watching is very happy. The main target group of this movie is children, and it is not suitable for anything complicated and deep. At this level, you can already score high points. But the director did not neglect it because of facing a simple group. The whole film is very delicate and delicate, from costumes to music to dubbing, which is very Scottish. The whole plot can also be called unconventional. With the princess as the protagonist, there are many similarities to the princess movies produced by Disney, but the difference can be said to be essential. There are princesses but no princes. The consistently missing ""father"" this time is the male closest to the main line of the story. The king gave his daughter a wanton growth. When Melida's superb arrows brought a restless restlessness, his first reaction was still cheering uncontrollably, except for the father, the basic male role-playing in the film All are characters far from the center. After Melida accidentally turned her mother into a bear, she went through all the hardships and struggles. She even joined the team with three younger brothers and finally achieved a happy ending.

285,Joe_Chadowski,"Pixar's latest effort enchants us with stunning visuals, and charismatic characters, but misses the X factor that makes Pixar film's great",7,25 June 2012,"This should have been an easy review to write. Brave should have been a film that cemented itself as one of the all time greats, a necessary addition to any Top Films list. It should have been a film that claimed a place in our hearts as so many other Pixar films have in the past. But it's not. And writing this review is proving anything but easy. It's hard because I'm sitting at my Dell Latitude feeling bewildered at how a film from the best animation studio in the world left me feeling lukewarm at best.A bit of background on the film first; this film went through two directors. After Brenda Chapman left the film for reasons I don't know, Mark Andrews was hired as a shoe in. This wasn't the first Pixar film to have multiple directors, just unplanned multiple directors. This is where my major problem with this film stems. Everything from Brenda Chapman is textbook Pixar class and charisma, but once Mark Andrews gets the reins (and you WILL know when it happens), the film takes an abrupt and uncomfortable shift towards the dark, and really challenges the boundaries of PG. It feels like two different films tacked on to one another with Gorilla Glue, it's as if the directors had no collaboration with each other. A real shame because up until it takes this dark turn, the rest of this film is a class act bursting with potential.However to lament on the pitfalls is to ignore the positives. Pixar created two characters with copybook classic credentials in Princess Merida, and her father Fergus. Merida as the independent, self-confident, inurbane princess has a tongue-in-cheek charm and a personality that brings a genuine smile to your face. The other hero of character is Fergus, his character of a bumbling king with an overpowering queen is cliché, but he's executed brilliantly and is the provider of the majority of humor on Brave. Another immensely impressive aspect is its supremely dazzling animation aesthetics, the resplendent beauty of the Scottish countryside sometimes stealing scenes from its characters. Whether or not you agree that's brilliant is more subjective.Now this may seem like the ranting of a spoilt wannabe movie critic weaned on delusions of grandeur, and hollow satisfaction from demeaning films with hype behind them, but I can assure you my size 10.5s remain firmly on the ground. This film is still a damn sight better than a majority of animated films out there, and it no doubt sets a new bar for animation quality other films won't be able to reach without a pole vault. I generally like this film and its good moments are plentiful and remind you why we love these films so much. Pixar films are utterly infectious when done correctly, Brave isn't up to the standards of their best, you won't fall in love with it, but forget the scale of its predecessors and you'll definitely be impressed by it.",Brave
286,sonicfan5715,"Not nearly as ""Brave"" as it could have been",7,6 April 2013,"Supposedly after going through a couple rewrites, producers, directors, ""Brave"" went out to the public with most of us not really sure about the film, but very intrigued all the same. Pixar had never done anything like this, and after the pointless ""Cars 2"", a lot of us were hoping ""Brave"" would redeem Pixar and pick it back up on its feet as one of the best animation studios to date... unfortunately it let a lot of us down. But by no means, this is not a bad movie in the slightest; it has colorful and lush animation (like Pixar always does), fun and memorable characters (I particularly like Meridas father Fergus, voiced by Billy Connolly, and his three mischievous triplets), and a likable, ""play-it-safe-no-risks"" storyline that calls back to films about rebellious teenage girls like ""The Little Mermaid"" and is usually always enjoyed... but that is EXACTLY the problem this film ever so suffers from.""Brave"" is extremely inconsistent in terms of its tone. The original trailer for this was building up to a deep epic story about finding ones self, and confronting ones fears through always being ""brave"". Later trailers revealed more lighthearted, goofy elements, but all the same Pixar has had a habit of making their movie trailers looking very silly, but they always come off as very good movies (save Cars 2, which was good, but again, NOT needed). Once I saw the movie, I enjoyed it as a whole, but at the same time was very disappointed in the end result.It starts off very nicely during the first half of the film, but the second half is when it really botches was it was originally building up to. We've got a Scottish kingdom, and in this beautifully created world we've got Merida (Kelly MacDonald), a young teenage girl who just wants to be free and do what she feels is her ""destiny"", and eventually was to go out and look for it. She goes through her emotions about not wanting to be queen, rebelling against her strict mother (Emma Thompson), to the point of going out and finding her ""destiny"". Up to that point, the movie was doing really well; how the animators captured the Scottish countryside and some of its culture is well done, as well as some very funny Scottish humor (drinking, brawling, mooning), enjoyable characters that are memorable enough that make you want to see the film more than once, and having some good buildup as to what Meridas ""destiny"" would be. And this is where it takes a turn for the worse.Once Merida gets a potion to change her mother from a sneaky old witch, therefore changing her destiny, the film takes a ""Brother Bear"" feel when the potion literally turns her mother into a bear herself (should have seen it coming since the main antagonist is an evil bear, who was once a man himself). Thereafter Merida has to find a way to keep her mother safe and return her to normal before her mother loses her human self becomes a bear with no human emotions at all. That does sound all interesting, but it plays out very safely and times it seems too traditionally Disney, and even though this is a Disney film, that's not what we were expecting from this. Once the end of the story rolls along, it resumes the tone that the beginning of the film captured, but by that point we were disappointed, because we wanted the whole movie to be like that.Nonetheless, after ranting here, ""Brave"" isn't a bad movie at all, it just doesn't live up to our expectations, therefore making it one of Pixars lesser films. But it still manages to keep our attention with good characters, beautiful Pixar animation, and manages to capture the Scottish feel pretty well. Certainly not as ""Brave"" as it could have been, but it still manages to hold up nonetheless... well, almost anyway.7/10 sonicfan5715/Jeffrey V",Brave

288,TheCartoonfaxuator,If you want to know the truth about this movie i recommend you read my review.,7,31 March 2013,"Pixar's Brave ranks as one of their most graphically impressive movies. It also has Pixar's first Disney princess. But did this movie live up to the hype it created. Just before you read this review. I just want to let you know that everything i'm about to say is accurately correct. Brave is decent to good movie. It doesn't have the most inspiring Disney princess. But is has a bold one. The Main character is a princess named Merida. Since she was a little kid. She has been very different from her mother. One day the Queen told a 16 yr. old Merida that she was to be married by one three boys who would win an archery contest. At the contest she embarrassed her entire clan, and mainly her mother. Merida ran away and came back with a whole lot of trouble. In the end she was able to fix it all. First off, this movies story really wasn't that impressive. Mainly because of the movies trailers and commercials. Which were the things that royally screwed this movie. Throughout the trailers and commercials, there were several different themes of what this movie could have been about. There were themes women's rights, being brave, and War. The movie showed all the themes in scenes that were 1 to 2 minutes. One thing that should be noted, is that Brave is a Disney princess movie. One thing Disney takes with all seriousness are Disney princesses. Merida is the first Disney princess that isn't based on a fairy tale. Merida compared to the other princesses doesn't show her theme so well. Merida's theme is being Brave, but she doesn't show it that that much through out the movie. Other than the just talking about Merida, There are other characters. Her Queen Mom, King Dad, three little troublesome brothers and the villain, Mor'du. These are the only characters you're going to want to pay attention to. All the other characters are in the movie just to move the story and have a few laughs. Brave's graphics are jaw dropping. Everything the characters do is realistic. Even though the characters, not counting the royal family, have oddly shaped bodies. I'll say this with no regrets. Walt Disney would be proud of Pixar's efforts on the graphics. In the End, Pixar's Brave didn't live up to the hype it created. I'm not saying that it should be only watched once. I would love to watch is movie again and again. It was just the first Disney princess movie that wasn't made for everyone. I give Brave a 6.6/10. I just want to mention that if it weren't for Wreck-it-Ralph being the first good video game movie. I bet my SOUL, that it would have won the Oscar for best animation instead of Brave. And if you think i'm just a fan boy of Wreck-it-Ralph, Go to Wikipedia and look up the nominees for best animation 2012 Oscars.",Brave
289,HunterGee,Kinda boring,5,1 October 2021,"First let me say the animation was great. I like when these movies have their own unique styles. I'd give that about a 9/10.As for the story, the start was slow. The characters were not very interesting and the plot was bland. This movies was like a vanilla cake with nothing on it. You can eat it but it's nothing special. I had a few laughs. The father, Fergus was a bit of a hoot. But honestly the best part was the climax and it was the only time I actually had some interest in what was going on. When Merida thought her mom was going to become the bear it was actually a little sad.The relationship between the mother and daughter was alright. The concept of of them not getting along and later bonding was not bad at all. I just think it could have been done better.I certainly won't be watching this animation again.",Brave
290,babyZ2020,"No matter what your age, home is an eternal harbor",8,19 May 2020,"From the point of view of the plot, it should be a relatively simple and easy-to-understand story. The plot is very compact and there are a lot of laughs. The whole process of watching is very happy. The film is mainly for children, and it is not suitable for anything complex and deep. At this level, you can already score high points. But the director did not neglect it because of facing a simple group. The whole film is very delicate and delicate, from costumes to music to dubbing, they are all very Scottish, and the whole plot can also be called unconventional. With the princess as the protagonist, there are many similarities to the princess movies produced by Disney, but the difference can be said to be essential. There are princesses but no princes. The consistently missing ""father"" is the male closest to the main story line The king gave his daughter a wanton growth. When Melida 's superb arrows brought a restless restlessness, his first reaction was still cheering uncontrollably. Besides the father, the basic male role-playing in the film Are all characters away from the center. After Melida accidentally turned her mother into a bear, she went through all the hardships and struggles, and even the three bear children's brothers joined the team, and finally achieved a happy ending. The little princess also practiced true courage. The story as a whole Harmony and touching, it is definitely a good film worth pondering.",Brave
291,natygance,Beautiful movie,8,24 July 2012,"So..I went to see Brave a little confused because there were a lot of people saying it sucked, and a lot of people saying it was excellent. I must say I loved the movie, i know people are disappointed because the trailer showed a girl with an arrow and they were expecting a more epic movie,I was one of them, I was expecting an epic movie. However, I wasn't disappointed with the result, Brave is a beautiful movie,to say the least. The CGI is incredible, and the landscape is gorgeous. I know most people say its great because the princess doesn't end up with a prince, which is a great aspect of the movie, however, I think the most important thing is the fact that they show that you can pursuit your own happiness without depending on somebody else to do it, you can be happy trying to fulfill your own personal dreams, and see where life takes you. Apart from this, which I believe is the main message of the movie, it has some very funny characters and very likable, of course the mother-daughter issue is one we have all probably went through. Another of pixar and Disney's greatest.",Brave
292,beingagain,A film riddled with feminist ideology and poor disney stereotypes,4,7 March 2018,"A film based on the tom boy feminist ideology welded to simplistic disney stereotypes.The usual princess story, an immensely privileged tantruming individual portrayed as a victim at the centre of the story, men only good as violent stupid ineffectual oafs for unrealistically un-empowered oppressed women to easily manipulate etc, whilst the lead individual is shown to be superior at all male virtue half the time, she then messes up the world entirely with her youthful arrogance and then practically single handedly recovers, in the usual up a tree down a tree scenario, for her only to end pretty much back at the beginning a little wiser in a way her elders understood, The only in theory beneficial message in the film being to state the arranged marriages are not good, but its probably not watched by any community that might benefit from that message, not that arranged marriages prove completely ineffectual in terms of sustaining birth rates and sometimes making successful marriages, All in all it is a 'cartoon for children' and the parables and metaphors are pretty simplistic, girls get what they want etc, but ultimately the protagonist saves the day, and then gets to write her own ticket and everyones happy, and the adults learn the lessons from the children etc, but theirs no follow up of her still being single at 40 with cats rather than children etc ;) perhaps I care too greatly for more complex realistic parables, On the upside the film is well animated and the quality good, but as per usual as with all essentially kids films, its all just a bit too chintzy disney simplistic, not sure as to the virtue of feeding this kind of fodder to children. and what harm or benefit it really does?",Brave

294,pranav_2001,Too much of fantasy,6,24 June 2012,"Watching Brave felt like reading a story out of a fairy tale book. This movie had everything that belonged to a fairy-land. A princess, a King, a Queen, a witch with spells and potions, magic and a lesson for all the kids out there :-) And when there is a princess, there has to be a prince who would fall in love with her and take her away, but no, that's not how it is :-)Spoiler alert, beyond this point What I admired about the movie was that makers decided to move away from the usual theme of princess falling in love with a prince and made a different kind of theme, a family oriented movie. The movie revolves around rebellious teenage princess trying to break traditions and paving her own future. The Queen struggles to make her daughter the perfect princess who has a class and charisma of an ideal Queen.But I usually find flaws in these movie quite easily, they get very predictable after a certain time. The movie wasn't 'extremely-funny' or 'extremely-motivating' or had something that would leave the audience spell bound. I found the Ice-Age trailer to be more entertaining than this movie.My suggestion: If you like animated movies you will enjoy every bit of it. It's an OK-OK movie.",Brave

296,jonnydmullan,A Brave effort,6,7 April 2020,"Brave is about Merida, a Scottish princess who doesn't want to get married so badly that she turns to witchcraft to get out of it.Here's the thing about Brave. It is very much a one-time go sort of movie. If I had no idea what was happening, it would be great. The best part of this movie occurs half way through. And the plot advances at a snails pace to get it there. I don't like using the term boring, as I think interest is subjective. But looking at it as objectively as I can, waiting nearly an hour for something to happen is boring. I was constantly checking the time bar. As soon as we got there, it got going well. It was funny, unpredictable, sad and fast paced.However, Brave suffers for another reason. Pixar had been criticised for their lack of female protagonists and this is their response. We see this happen in a couple of movies. They try to show that girls have power too. Not that it isn't true, it is. But it overwhelms the movie. The fact of the matter is that in this time period women did have little control over their lives. I don't think this is the direction they needed to go in order to show this message.Finally, they try to make Merida a quirky and relatable character. And I totally understand why? However something about a girl with a bow and an arrow feels predictable and cliché to me. It has picked up off the Hunger Games buzz and although Brave doesn't suffer because of this, it does make the whole archery scene feel overdone.Overall, worth watching. It is good. I think it could be better. It is very much harkening back to the Disney princess days and I enjoyed that.",Brave

The potion does more than Merida asked for. PIXAR is the best animation studio right now but last year the put out Cars 2 which I didn't like and found it a huge disappointment, being a big fan of Cars. I think they redeemed themselves with Brave and the short that shows before the feature, La Luna. Brave has great voice-overs and fantastic Scottish-accents. I didn't find the accents annoying and I don't think they got in the way of the viewing experience although others might disagree. I thought the voice- overs were great. The animation was spectacular as it always is with PIXAR. You can really see the facial expressions well so the viewer can interpret the character's feelings without them talking.

""Shrek"" was a film enjoyable both for children because of the action, and adults because of the subtext and witty dialogue. This film is not only painfully dull and completely repetitive of many other films with similar plots, but also, the protagonist is unbelievably unlikeable.If I wanted to watch a teenage brat argue with her mother I would go down to the local shopping center and stand inside a shop like ""Claire's accessories"".

300,HenbaineAccount2,Brave the bad reviews- it's worth your time!,5,11 April 2017,"Despite many negative views, I decided to watch this movie, mainly due to boredom but also I do love all things Celtic and mythical.I won't go into as much detail as I have with some reviews but just highlight the good, bad and in-between points as I saw themFirstly, the good: The animation is gorgeous as is the music. I love the backdrop and can related to the freedom of climbing cliffs and standing under waterfalls etc as I have done these things and felt incredible.As someone who loves nature and freedom I felt the main character Merida was not so unbelievable. I actually can relate well to the strenuous relationship she has with her mother and her father being stuck in the middle keeping the peace. The story line starts off very well and has a nice heartwarming and resolved if not predictable ending.There is a good sense of myth, moral and culture which is rare in movies these days. The story is simple but quite clever in a way that everything does still link nicely together if you really look at the imagery. I understand the original title was not ""Brave"" but ""The Bear and the Bow"" which is more what it says on the tin but hey. There IS bravery, physical bravery in tackling ones enemies in combat-but also the emotional-to face your own misgivings and admit you are wrong, to be willing to change your close and comfortable outlook on life and take risks,and to always stand up for what you believe in no matter what. Shame some people seemed to have missed this point.The not so good:I felt the story line was too predictable (good for kids maybe but adults will guess it almost from the off) and things just fall into place too easily,even the end ""battle"" is resolved far too quickly & easily. Also, sadly as time advance it becomes a little too silly & gimmicky in parts (Did we really need the naughty siblings- and did we REALLY need them becoming bears!?)or the stock neurotic overweight maid and clumsy,easily swayed but well meaning side characters? Shame because while bringing some comedic relief,all were quite forgettable and served as a tired cliché this movie could have soared without.It lacks the epic standing the trailers promised. Also, the men are depicted as blundering fools with no looks, sense,or charisma, the ladies- yep, the opposite.(However- it was refreshing to see this in a way as many animations have shown women as weak and feeble totally relying on men and princes- Merida not only does not rely on her version of Mr charming-she shuns the very notion of losing her freedom!)SO,to sum up- Slightly lacking substance but still a very good family movie.Aesthetically striking,nice and light hearted but with some more moving lesson on attitudes and the value of your friends and loved ones.",Brave

What happened, I am not sure, but I wonder why this movie took 4 years to make, graphic wise maybe, but they let the story slip through. It reminded me of Brother Bear, which was better in my opinion. My kids liked it, but they like any movie that is made for kids, so that is not saying a whole lot. At the end of the move there were people clapping in the theater, so obviously i am somewhat alone in my opinion here.

She is a strong headed, brave teenage princess most importantly she is the best archer of her kingdom. She wants to be free from all traditions & bindings and she don't want to get married at this moment. Her father King Fergus is a big supporter of her and in contrast her mother tries to guide and control her in every aspect of her life.As Merida become teen several marriage proposal come from clans.

All clan's leader's sons have to participate in a contest which is to be chosen by Merida and winner of the contest will get Merida. Merida chose Archery.In the day of the contest Merida dramatically participate in the contest and wants her own hand of marriage and she become the champion. Then she has a fight with her mother and go to the forest to find her destiny. She finds a witch there. She manages the witch do a magic so that her mother change and agree with her. But witch has no idea what the change would be so she just make a magic cake that will changer Merida's mother.After eating the cake Her mother turn into a Bear!!! This is the sorrow but also funny part of the movie.

After a lot of trouble and help of the fate Merida get her mother back, Of course the changed mother which Merida wanted in first place.Animation quality of this movie is impeccable. Deep details of every characters were there. I like the flame like hair of Merida which separates her from any conventional fairy tale princess. As the movie plot was in Scotland and characters were Scotties they all spoke in Scottish accent which was very amusing and funny. One thing was missing in this movie which is Narrative momentum. For a Fantasy-Animation movie like Brave Narrative momentum is a must. Teen age girls especially tomboy girls can learn a lot of positive and negative things from this movie. Merida shows how to be independent, Dreamer & a task achiever. In contrast this character is also rude, problematic, strong head, spoil and these characteristics are unwelcome.",Brave

I thought it was a fun and excellent animated film with great animation. I've always enjoyed watching Disney movies since I was young. Pixar has always made great films such as Toy Story, A Bugs life, Monsters Inc., Cars and many other films. Another one of the films I enjoyed was Ratatouille because I love to watch movies about cooking. Another reason why I love this movie is because it makes me feel relaxed too. I appreciate many creative ideas people think of to make a great movie. It's always nice to watch movies that speak to someone no matter what anyone likes or what speaks to them more. I enjoyed this film and I would give it a 10 out of 10 for a very well done Disney film with computer animation and a happy ending.

The animation is high quality, but the story is semi coherent, mean spirited and lousy. The heroine seems like a real brat and she doesn't change. Her father is made out to be a Scottish highlander so huge he dwarfs everyone, kind of makes him hard to like. The only sympathetic character in the thing, the mother, gets turned into a bear by a magic tart made by a witch. The girl feeds her a cake that makes her sick and then turns her into a bear, in danger of being killed by the father. It's not cute, or charming. It is very creepy, it's like she poisoned her mother. It's terrible, and i'm a grown man. I can't imagine how a child would perceive her ghastly transformation. It only gets worse from there.

What it turned out to be was a mess of a fight between the girl and her mom with some bizarre magic thrown in. This came so far out of left field that the movie was probably 2/3 over before I understood what the actual storyline was. I didn't like this direction, it felt like they took a character who could have been strong and confident in herself right from the beginning, and turned her into a whiny, teenage brat. I didn't think the connection between mother and daughter was heartfelt or genuine at all. The connection to her father was at least believable in that he had old school beliefs versus her brat whining. The twins were annoying. And the animation was... Lost in all the bizarreness in the story. Plus it seemed like it was someone's goal to make as many different body shapes as possible and that put me off too.

311,bobby-maddox,"I really wanted Brave to be my new favorite Pixar movie, but it came up short.",6,27 April 2018,"The early trailers for this film convinced you that this was going to be an epic and magical adventure (with some whimsical humor) that the geniuses at Pixar were going to take you on--a redemption of Cars 2 of the previous year. As time went on, I began to see newer trailers/tv spots for the film, that left me in question.
Why are they marketing this as a down-right comedy now?
What's with the bear cub and the boobs thing?
Has Pixar lost their minds?I saw the movie in theaters. I went in alone (as a film critic), still with very high expectations for the film despite the recent questionable advertisements it had.The film starts out with Merida (the main character) as a little girl. It's her birthday, she gets a bow from her father as a gift. Little Merida goes into the forest to find her lost arrow, and finds what they call ""wisps"". She retrieves her lost arrow, and goes back to tell her parent what she saw, and then her party gets crashed by a 15 foot monster bear. You'd think all of these things would connect later in the movie or help along the plot... but no. Seriously, this opening sequence has nothing to do with what the film is really about.Turns out that Merida's mother arranged for her to get married, and the suitors are on their way. Merida doesn't want to get married, and tries to break tradition in her own way, and runs away to find a witch in the forest who gives her a cake that changes her mother into a bear. And because the spell didn't do what she wanted, Merida is trying to get a refund. That's it.Really there's no need for the movie to be called ""Brave"" since there were no achievements in bravery in this film. I personally though that ""Rebel"" would've been a better title since it was basically all about Merida's rebellion against her mother, family, and cultural traditions. And they for some reason throw the 15 foot bear back into the movie, as well as comic nudity (which I found to be more on Dreamworks' level) and a ""hilarious"" moment where the bear cub lands in a heavy-set servant woman's boobs (which I found had Disney written all over it).Basically, the animation was beautiful, but the story was a mess. They had too many ideas for the story and it felt like they wanted to please all the story writers so they shoved everything in. This is sad because at one time, Pixar prided themselves on story. Everyone knows if a film doesn't have a good story, it's not going to be good. There are so many examples of that courtesy of Dreamworks Animation (Shrek the Third, Bee Movie, Madagascar 1).I really wanted Brave to be my new favorite Pixar movie, but it came up short. Just like Cars 2, I enjoyed the Pixar animated short film more than the actual feature film. I will buy Brave on DVD in due time, (since I am a hardcore Pixar fan, and I own every movie), but like Cars 2 (which I also have on DVD) I will rarely watch it.Disney has very much taken over Pixar, and it's really starting to show ever since Cars 2.",Brave
312,deeprise1988,Princess tale by Pixar.,7,6 January 2013,Brave is tale of coming of age story of a princess. A tale of responsibility and realization of that responsibility. A tale of change for good. Pixar's Brave is good traditional tale with good message. Animation as always is fantastic. A Princess to change her Mother's traditional decision for her to choose a groom and get married indulge in immature spell of Witch and What spell brings to their life is rest of the story. Pixar are known to make some emotional tale with fantastic animation and here they have follow their tradition but with change. Here is a first female lead in Pixar's history of awesome movies. Brave is not creative like Wall-e and UP but it is good animation for all.,Brave
313,shead23,Voices all wrong and a despicable storyline !!!,4,31 January 2013,"Merida's voice is all so very wrong plus adding her story line which is very weak and, at best, irritating !!!! Makes 'Brave' a big disappointment. Great animation but became rather boring in the end . Merida's treatment of her mother showed a poor example to the young and moral story lines were always the corner stone for Disney . This young, over the top lass should have 3yrs community service !! The Scottish theme became somewhat lost and the 'triplets' not eating their haggis was a bit crass ! They didn't have bagpipes, tartan or paint their faces in Scotland in the 13th or 14th century and whilst this maybe rather pedantic - it all added to the 'lentil soup' miss match.. Tangle outshines this by a 1,000,000 light bulbs",Brave
314,jordangross,Better than expected!,7,28 June 2012,"Honestly I wasn't looking forward to this Disney film at first because it really didn't interest me at all. I thought that Disney Princess movies have ran their course, but after watching the film I found out I was wrong. Disney just never seems to disappoint me, even if I didn't have the slightest interest. I only went to go see this film because my friends were like ""Hey let's go see a movie."" Since I have seen the other movie that are already in theaters, we all decided to see Brave at the last second. The film stars Kelly Macdonald (No Country for Old Men, Trainspotting), Billy Connolly (The Last Samurai, The Boondock Saints), and Emma Thompson (Nanny McPhee, In the Name of the Father). The 3D in this film was not as good as I thought it would be for a Disney film. Most animated movies I see have great 3D and sadly this one didn't impress me at all. The film starts of as your average Disney movie does and you meet your princess Merida (Kelly Macdonald) right away. Now something I did like was that this takes place in Scotland so everyone has an awesome accents. Also something that was good is that the film was a lot darker than other Disney films. After trying to be forced to get set up with a suitor to marry her, she runs away from her problems and finds a way to change her fate around. At this point in the film is where the film takes a different and surprising turn where if you don't like it, then you won't like the rest of the movie. I happen to like where it went and enjoyed the whole film.It is definitely not the best Disney movie ever made, but it is a pretty decent film. Truthfully I was expecting to be disappointed from the film and I am glad to say that was very impressed. Especially at the animation, Merida's hair looks so real in the way it moves and looks. Little kids will eat this movie up as well as adults will enjoy the film. Rating: 7/10Thank you for reading my review, any feedback would be greatly appreciated!",Brave
315,martin-kooistra,"Nice graphics, but nothing new here.",6,14 August 2012,"In this story of a Scottish princess Merida having to cope with the responsibilities thrust upon her by her lineage by initially rebelling against it and (obviously) finally settling for it, there's little in terms of originality. The story is rather slight, the casting a bit obvious, even though some of the Scottish accents are rather strained. It's all strictly formula, covered up with the high quality animation we've come to expect from Pixar studios. Someone apparently decided that the main character was to have extremely wrong, bright red curly hair, and it's plain to see that a lot of effort has been put into making Merida's hair move to and fro quite naturally. It's a bit too obvious as a showcase and I wish they had put more effort in creating a more compelling storyline and some interesting supporting characters, neither of which is apparent. Brave is graphically well made, but in terms of story-telling there's not that much to recommend it. Looks good, is never really boring, but there's nothing truly original to be found here, unfortunately.",Brave

317,JBlueNote,Pixar Still Amazes Me,7,6 July 2012,"Unlike my mom, I enjoyed this Disney Pixar movie just like I have the others. It kind of felt like a movie for all ages since it was set in two layers, one part being for the kids, and the other part (being the morale of the story) for those who are older. Going in I thought it was going to be about the girl trapped in a forest or something finally facing her fear, but it was something kind of the same, and a little different. I do agree with what my mom said about its short length, but I liked it. I was amazed that there were still a lot of people, mostly families with their little kids, that came to see it. I almost couldn't find a seat. Perhaps they decided to go see this movie to beat the insane, 100+, record breaking heat that was awaiting us outside. I'd recommend it though if you're a Pixar fan or just want to see some movie that I guess would ""touch at the heart strings"". I'd rate it a 6.8/10.",Brave

So of course Merida seeks out a spell to change tradition and of course the spell goes all wrong. In the end, the real question isn't will they live happily ever after but who will learn from the experience.I am so glad Disney has created another ""anti-princess"" like Mulan.

320,Juaqino,What the heck did I just watch?,1,22 June 2012,"That is exactly what I thought when the film was over.Seriously, that was a Pixar film? You have to be joking.When you get right down to it, it's yet another misfit princess story. It's about a somewhat unruly princess who wants something different in life than what her parents want for her. Now how many times have we seen this story before? I'm not even going to list off those stories, because most of you know and have seen them by now.Simply, there is nothing in this movie that was memorable and that we haven't seen before. We get the misfit princess story, and that's exactly what we get. No surprises. It was all very predictable......until midway through the movie. (SPOILER ALERT) In case you haven't seen the film, the princess(Merida) is not your typical princess. She's outgoing - she's a fighter. She is particularly good at archery, supposedly better than everyone else. But since she's a princess, OF COURSE she has to marry a prince. Does she want to marry a prince? NO. Are all of her suitors complete idiots who are unworthy of her? ABSOLUTELY. Do her parents understand her? OF COURSE NOT. Does this remind you of any other better movies? So anyway, since her mother in particular doesn't see eye-to-eye with her, Merida pulls a petty trick on her by slipping her a potion that would ""change her"". Gee, this couldn't turn out to be anything bad, right? Well, it turned out bad alright, and provided the only surprise in the movie: Her mother turns into a BEAR! You've got to be kidding me.The rest of the film is spend having Merida trying to undo the spell whilst goofing around with her mother bear friend. (END SPOILER ALERT) If you are curious enough to see where that part of the story goes, you should see it for yourself.All in all, it's a very forgettable movie. There were some attempted laughs in the film, but none that made me so much as chuckle. It was mostly cookie-cutter children's movie writing; the kind of ""funny"" things you'd expect the characters to be saying rather than giving them some charming uniqueness.Am I the only one who despises the three little boys? The whole time I got the feeling that the writers were using them as a device to keep the story interesting for little kids. I had the same complaint about the three gargoyles in The Hunchback of Notre Dame; They were irritating and added nothing to the story. All they added were typical ""little boy"" mischief that made me yearn for the end of the current scene.The only amount of heart in this film was after the mother threw Merida's bow in the fire, and then we see her pull it out of the fire regretfully, realizing what she had done. Granted, that's not much, but at least that's SOME glimpse into a character. They could have easily ended the scene right there, and made the mother look like a complete witch, but for a brief moment, we get to see a little bit of how the mother actually feels.Thanks for wasting my money, Pixar!",Brave

322,Tinny-Tinette,"Pixar or no Pixar; Brave does have a few strengths, but a lot of flaws",6,25 June 2012,"First I want to start this review by saying that I'm not a Pixar fan. Frankly, I think Pixar is one of the most overrated companies ever. While they have churned out a few great films now and then (the first Toy Story, Finding Nemo, Up and yes, both Cars films), I've found most of their films to be quite adequate and unremarkable. Therefore I wasn't going into ""Brave"" expecting a so-called Pixar masterpiece. But rather a masterpiece on its own. While I had my doubts, I still hoped to be blown away. And while some parts lived up to my expectations, other parts did disappoint me.Despite that I'm lukewarm about most Pixar features, I shall admit that Pixar had really never made a bad movie (even Cars 2, which everyone seemed to despise, was quite enjoyable, despite its flaws). Brave doesn't fall into that category, but it's still without doubt one of Pixar's most flawed movies.To start with the positive aspects of this film; The animation is a definite top-notch. Lush, detailed and absolutely gorgeous. The cute and satisfying prologue is reminiscent of Disney's Dinosaur and Jurassic Park The Lost World. The score of Patrick Doyle is absolutely wonderful and the few songs are enjoyable as well. The Scottish accents give the film authenticity and the voices are perfect for the casts, especially Billy Connolly as Merida's goofy and fun-loving father, Fergus, which is the strongest character on the film.So where does the film fall flat? One word (an aspect which several reviewers and especially an early review of Ain't it Cool-News were pointing out); the narrative. The film lacks a consistent storyline. After a fairly satisfying thirty minutes, the film turns another direction and becomes another ""Brother Bear"", which is one of Disney's most flawed and insipid features, in my opinion. While Brave never becomes an identical copy of the bear movie, the similarities are obvious enough to make the non-fans cringe. For there on, the movie loses some of its spark, becomes less engaging and introduces the viewers to some plot points which are even more insipid and laughable.So how could I depict Brave as a whole? Its not a awful film, but it's indeed a frustrating one. How could a movie like this lack such a coherent narrative? While I don't find it as mediocre as Brother Bear, it's still less satisfying than what it could have been. But despite all these problems, I'm still giving Brave a few points for the positive aspects.",Brave

For me, I can imagine the legend the story plays out in the annals of folklore. It does work in that childhood folk-tale with a moral at the end. I liked that aspect a lot, and not to mention the computer animated detail and atmosphere is fantastic. I can reason why it's not a part of the Pixar best. The drama isn't new and the beginning is slow. I would have loved to see a story that dares to 'go there' like bringing in gender identity or role reversal. But if we can show our support for more movies like this, or even the voices who want better, than I am sure we can get more and probably better work.",Brave

325,zereshk,"Pretty, pretty, pretty...",5,24 August 2012,"This is a film about how important it is to be told fairy tales as a child. Because if you are, you learn early on that if you formulate a wish or a spell with ANY degree of ambiguity, you are likely to get the complete opposite of what you actually wanted. So it was no big surprise that Merida got something she didn't want at all. ""I want my mother to change"" is possibly the most ambiguous wish I have ever heard. I don't know why the witch cast the same spell on Elinor as on the prince of yore but she seemed like a bit of a con artist anyway, so maybe she doesn't know any other spells. Maybe she had stolen the recipe for the spell from a proper witch.The morale of the story is as Disney as it gets. A young, pretty woman fights for ideas that are revolutionary in her time but completely mainstream in our own day and age. Because while Merida might be Brave, Disney most certainly is not, which is why the ""inspirational"" speeches the protagonists give at the end of their films tend to infuriate thinking people with their banality.The notion that proper communication is the universal remedy for all conflict is also central to this film. As soon as the mother truly understands her daughter, she, and later all the tribal chiefs, suddenly cast their aspirations to power, their sense of tradition and propriety and their plans for the future of the kingdom aside. The belief that honest conversation and sharing of all the important facts and viewpoints necessarily leads to a universally accepted consensus seems to be a very American one, as apparent in the political debates of the country as in its film industry but hardly anyone else - except maybe for Bollywood - seems to believe in this formula.The film is really pretty though, and the characters, while not terribly complex, are likable. The scenery is very, very beautiful. So if you are planning to see the film, go see it while it's still in the cinema because it probably loses most of its charm when not viewed on the big screen.",Brave
326,manuscriptna,"Wonderful animation, disappointing ""moral""",8,22 June 2012,"With its usual charm, Pixar delivers another fine movie, save for a letdown, which I'll explain later. Their animation captures the characters and their habits perfectly, and it couldn't be done any other way. They also continue their creativity, both in script and animation (which were yet again incredible), and had the audience laughing frequently!The characters were done very well. Merida, the princess, is a headstrong free spirit that wants to ""change her fate"" (of being betrothed against her will) at nearly any cost. Like her wild, flaming hair, she will not be held back. King Fergus is jovial and sympathetic, and yet a fiercely loyal husband. Queen Elinor is a lady proper, and wishes the same upon her daughter. The three sons, while never speaking, were portrayed fantastically. This shows the superior nature of Pixar: the ability to convey spectacularly through animated expression and posture.*SPOILER ALERT* Elinor, the prim mother, undergoes change herself. Facing the uncomfortable reality of becoming a beast, she must face her unruly side. As the credits begin to roll, one is left wondering: ""Which character am I to look up to?"" Merida is headstrong and sometimes disobedient. Fergus is understanding and supportive, but deaf to reason in a rage. Elinor is too strict. And what role does the witch play? Does she give Merida the spell in order to help her realize her mistake, or to cause more discord? She seemed regretful of giving the former prince the spell, in hiding her status as a witch, so it seems she has people's best interest in mind. *END SPOILER* Yet again, we find cauldrons producing what seems to result in good. Still, there is no character to completely imitate. This is one of Pixar's realistic conclusions, even if it isn't terribly original. There aren't any perfectly good people. (not even the heart-throb Young Macintosh) Everyone has a bad side to go along with their good, but each person is different. We can learn from each in a different manner.Once again, when the film ends, the audience is slightly confused by the ""moral."" ""You can change your fate"" is an odd choice for Pixar, and is a bit vague. It's not so much a moral as it is a challenge. Brave doesn't rely on other Pixar films for its reasoning or popularity. It sets itself apart, even in the purpose of the film. But is that a good thing? I don't think so, in this case. ""You can change your fate"" seems to encompass many ""morals,"" including ""do what your heart tells you,"" and as Jeremiah 17:9 says, ""The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately sick; who can understand it?""On a lighter note, this film is perfectly suitable for kids. Because of the heavy reliance on expression, they will be able to understand more than in usual animated film dialogue. *SPOILER ALERT* The only possible inappropriate scenes are when Fergus and his fellow hunters have just descended a tower using a rope made of their shed kilts. They aren't wearing them, of course. The only other one is when the three brothers change back into boys, without clothes of course. All of this is done in good-natured Scottish humor, and isn't much to worry about. *END SPOILER*In conclusion, the animation was superb, and the characters were fantastic. They are the reason I would go see this movie again, rather than the vague ""moral"" conclusion. You can learn a lot from them, but please don't ""follow your heart"" as a result of this movie.",Brave
327,ltc0928,It could have been better,5,13 August 2012,"In my own opinion, I fervently believe that Pixar doesn't make mistakes. So of course I was going to watch Brave and I thought that it was going to be amazing. Afterwards, I felt that it was... generic, predictable and slightly boring.After watching the trailer I was under the assumption that Brave was going to be an adventure- type movie. When it neared the middle, I realized that she wasn't going anywhere, and that kind of brought the movie down for me. Add that with the fact that the plot was a plot that we've all seen before. Honestly, there's nothing wrong with a plot like this where the main character learns a valuable lesson about not taking things for granted, but there was nothing special added here. I watched this movie, successfully predicting what would happen next, and it made the movie kind of a drag.Also, I felt that the characters lacked... depth, I guess I could say. They weren't memorable. I couldn't even tell you names besides Merida. I feel that the writers didn't spend enough time to really develop the characters as much as they should have.On the plus side, Brave was done nicely in a visual sense. Also, I loved how the writers portrayed Princess Merida as an independent, headstrong girl who didn't need a man to save her. She wasn't a damsel in distress and I loved that about her character. I'll admit, I'm a little biased so I wouldn't say the movie was outright terrible, but I will say that I wish the movie's plot was thought out and executed better. I do think that Brave was a nice movie, but it's not something I'd go out and purchase on DVD or rave about to others who haven't seen it yet. I'd tell others to just to Redbox it because, considering the movie's non- special, typical story, I'd go as far as to say that it's not worth the ridiculous price of a movie ticket nowadays.",Brave
328,BooChanan,Worth the embarrassment and deserves small round of applause,5,31 August 2012,"I entered the cinema to watch Brave with low expectations. I had heard in reviews that it wasn't PIXAR's best movie and the plot didn't look very exciting. However, I was pleasantly surprised by this movie; especially the first half. I found that PIXAR brought the characters to life and built up their stories. Another surprise was the beautiful soundtrack. I was expecting a poor Hollywood take on Celtic music. Instead, I was treated to a spectacular traditional Scottish sound experience with gorgeous vocals by Julie Fowlis. With this added to the stunning graphics and CGI landscape made a spectacular scene and opening half of this movie. But I had heard that there was a huge plot twist mid-way through this movie. I didn't yet know what the twist was but I had heard that, unfortunately, it made this movie......... a kids' movie. So, by the start of the second half of this movie, I was feeling slightly anxious about this plot twist. Suddenly, it dawned on me what the plot twist was. I was resisting the urge to scream out my disappointment in PIXAR and...............Then I realised that it actually wasn't too bad. No, actually, it was great. This plot twist was a humorous surprise that was extremely entertaining and was pulled off well.This movie is definitely not PIXAR's best film but is one that sends the company in a new direction. Hopefully, there will be no Toy Story 4 but instead a new PIXAR fairy-tale. If PIXAR can keep on producing new but nevertheless entertaining stories then there is no need for half-hearted sequels. Admittedly, some sequels have paid off but Disney may not want to take that risk again too many times.Brave is a spectacular film full of magical music, great graphics and creative characters. This hilarious and stunning tale has earned itself a 9/10 and small round of applause. *clap*clap*clap* It also made up for the fact that my friend and I were the only teenagers there!",Brave
329,kikyoC,Brave should definitely have a Brave 2 or Braver....,7,5 November 2013,"I liked it. At first when I saw it on Disney on Ice I was like heck no I am not watching that. Because to have some girl who always talking about I want to do what I want to do and don't care about other people's feelings is really ridiculous. However, I understood what they were talking about here because it must be rough for someone to tell you who you are going to spend the rest of your life with. However, I like the computer graphics and the story regardless. They did well with the relationship of the mother and the daughter. I do think both characters had development. The daughter was going to pick a mate, even though she didn't want to, which shows maturity. I think on Brave 2 (or most likely title - Braver), I think the daughter might marry one of those dudes(big guy with blonde hair preferrably)anyway, which will show that mother was right in a way. I think it could have been more action. It was a hilarious movie nevertheless, which I will expect from Pixar. I think they need to think of a better villain because there wasn't really one in here, surprisingly. Also I liked the princess thing some reviewers acting like that was bad I don't know why.

331,scramcat-1,Mediocre and strictly by the Disney rule book,4,22 June 2012,"I suffered through the endless parade of BRAVE trailers for months. So many months. I began to feel the movie had already come and gone. And the trailers told me the single most important thing about this movie: Pixar hired a crack team of PhD mathematicians, created 5 new fields of modeling mathematics, and bought 27 BlueGene supercomputers just to render the girl's hair.The hair bounces. The hair swings. The hair toussles. The hair drops stray locks here and there. The hair compacts. The hair billows. The hair responds to the wind. The hair responds to momentum and interia. The hair responds to humidity. The hair reflects every known shade or ""firey lass"" red along with previously unknown shades the computers postulated and shades the human mind cannot grasp.And the hair is wrapped around a familiar, mediocre, largely predictable story that you've seen several times before in several other ""girls can do anything boys can do"" movies and TV sitcom episodes.Don't let Pixar's technical expertise and visual humor distract you from the cold hard truth that the underlying story is pretty pale. The visual styling is dazzling and inspiring, the attention to detail is mind-boggling. Pixar makes unprecedented use of technology to create a previously unseen richness of environment.Which may explain why they had no energy left to craft a story you'd want to sit through.You've seen each fundamental step of the story anywhere from a million to infinity-minus-one times before. Puberty-straddling girl wants to be a free spirit. Girl complains that NO ONE UNDERSTANDS HER. Girl uses various tricks and ruses to try to demonstrate she's capable but only demonstrates that she's impatient and devious. Girl resorts to a dirty trick to manipulate parents who JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND HER. The dirty trick back-fires and girl spends most of the rest of the movie trying to undo the harm she caused and mistakenly comes to the conclusion that cleaning up her mess proves she's as cool as she thought she was, and isn't a stubborn, willful, spiteful, selfish, manipulative, deceitful, self-absorbed little bitch, not even a little.Remind you of an episode of ""That's So Raven""?

The animation was spectacular, and I couldn't stop staring at how beautiful it was- particularly Merida's hair. The voices were spot-on and fit perfectly. However, going into the movie knowing zero about the plot, I was immensely disappointed.The story I would, however, give a 3. The story is one of the most bland, cookie-cutter animation story lines. Girl wants more, girl meets witch, witch casts spell, girl must learn lesson to reverse spell. Also I never really understood where the ""Brave"" part came into play. I suppose the main character was ""brave"" in wanting her own destiny, but I was expecting it to surround some sort of gallant adventure. Overall the movie was really forgettable to me, and at times boring. There was barely any humor to break up the monotony of the storyline. Personally, in order for an animation to be memorable it needs to be either; an unforgettable story or a really humorous script. Brave was neither. This story will be easily forgotten in 10 years and will most certainly not go down as a classic.",Brave
333,wichio,Last year it was Cars 2 and now this? What's wrong with Pixar?,6,6 September 2012,"Ever since 2003 when they started having a yearly release (except for the 2005 break), Pixar films were a MUST in summer movie guides. The fact that they started getting a yearly Academy Award nomination for Best Animated Picture, just convinced us that the appeal wasn't just in our minds, and on top of that two consecutive nominations for Best Picture (which makes Pixar the only animation production company that has managed to get those since Disney with Beauty and the Beast). We wouldn't mind whether the trailer was appealing or not; or if the story seemed good... you may have even thought: ""meh... I don't think this one's gonna be better than the last one""... However, you would like it. Period. But after last year's ""Cars 2"" and this year's ""Brave"", it seems like we're gonna have to start analyzing whether to go watch a Pixar release or not, which is something you just didn't do. That's a huge fail for Pixar, cause they're gonna start loosing market. It will be just like Dreamworks. Sure they have ""Shrek"" and ""How to train your dragon""... But they also have ""Shark Tale"", ""Flushed Away"" and ""Over the hedge""... (Not to mention all the other Shrek films) You get it? Pixar being good is not a 'law' anymore. Whether the film was good or not, used to be a generalized ""Two thumbs up""... Now it depends on opinions. (And most of them are just not good) I'm glad the Academy punished them last year by not giving ""Cars 2"" a Best Animated Film nomination. I don't think ""Brave"" deserves one either, and if they give it, it will be based on graphics and animation more than for the film as a whole. (Although it wasn't nearly as bad as Cars 2) They're gonna have to do some serious changes in the way they're choosing their stories, for us to get back that ""Pixar = good"" concept we used to have. I'm pretty sure ""Monsters University"" wont disappoint us at all! But it's gonna take them more than one good film to get back to the top, plus, since there's only one yearly release, we're gonna spend the rest of the year with that bad flavor. So Pixar, be careful with what you release after that one... Now I KNOW THIS ISN'T A PIXAR REVIEW, but the expectations most of us had, were base on the fact that it was Pixar. SO LET ME TELL YOU WHAT WENT WRONG WITH THIS MOVIE, in my opinion. First, The lack of comedy. After Hilarious Finding Nemo and Monsters Inc. I think it's a Pixar trademark. Up and Ratatoille were not comedy- centered but it wasn't a missing ingredient. As far as I'm concerned, the triplets were the only comedy we saw.Second, The Characters. Besides Merida's Father, none of the characters were interesting. And if they were, they weren't fun to watch. You would expect a lot of fun from watching the queen dealing with becoming a bear but it really wasn't. The Witch scene was more a WTF moment rather than an interesting, mysterious or funny scene. The villain, in this case the giant bear, just wasn't a good one. You would very little fear it, and almost don't know anything about it. It's intentions against Merida and her mom were basically hunger. And don't even get me started with the leaders of the troops and their boring sons.Third. The Story. It didn't seem so bad. That was before Merida ran into the woods with Angus. Starting with the way her mother became a bear, to the way she broke the spell. It was pretty lame. I got the feeling it was starting to get good when they went into the other bear's cave and the truth about the bear was revealed, but a few minutes later, that was over and the story was lame again.Fourth. The Trailer. Everything good about the movie just seemed to be squeezed into the trailer. Not to mention I find it very misleading. You never quite find out what the movie really is about until you're in the movie theater. It's like the production company predicted the whole bear thing was going to repeal the audiences, so they decided to avoid putting it in the trailer to trick everyone into watching it.I really think the movie wouldn't have been as bad with better directing. But what are you gonna do?",Brave
334,cjorgensen-3,Disappointed,1,13 July 2012,"I love The Incredibles, Up, Shrek, Toy Story, Monsters Inc., Despicable Me and Megeaman. I thought I was going to see something that amazing, but with a female protagonist. But no. It was the same old Disney princess movie: a princess having problems about who she is or is not going to marry. We saw that in Snow White, Seeping Beauty, Cinderella, The Little Mermaid. Apparently, that all females ever do: fret about who they are going to marry.Spoiler alert.The movie starts out great: funny characters, great scenery, Scottish accents, and a promising protagonist. I'm sucked in and expecting something amazing and interesting, like the other Pixar movies. Then, of course, since it is the Dark Ages (and Disney, not ""really"" Pixar), the hand of the princess will be the prize in a contest. Been there, done that. Of course she doesn't want that, so she runs away and finds a witch and asks the witch to change her . . . her . . . fate? Like the trailers said? No. She wants to change her MOM. The princess does not want to grow and mature, she want's mom to quit bugging her. Mom has done everything she can to give the princess a wonderful life and educate and prepare her for a life of queen-ship. But that's not what the princess wants. The princess wants – what? She really has no viable alternative. It's not like she can go and get a career. The movie implies that if she gets married, she can't ride her horse or shoot her bow any more. Why not? So they parade out the three husband candidates and of course, even though they are the sons of great chieftains, they are all worthless. Predictable, boring plot. What if one of them was handsome, charming, and a good archer, then she might not have minded getting married and we could have seen the wedding in 3D.Back to the witch. Well, the witch only knows ONE spell: change it into a bear. That's a big help. The last person who bucked conformity and wanted to do his own thing, he got changed into a wild, destructive bear too. Is that one of the lessons in this movie? Conform or you will become a wild, destructive, shunned animal? When her mother eats the magic cake and begins to feel sick, all the princess can think about is if she still has to get married. What if the magic cake killed her mom? The princess doesn't seem too worried. Is this one of the lessons of the movie? If your parents are trying to do the very best for you, and it's cramping your style, just drug them to get them off your back. After mom turns into a bear, there was no plot any more. It was just running around like Bugs, Daffy and Elmer in the forest and the castle until it was time for the movie to end. BORING.Then there was the big speech the princess gave in the banquet room about ""Can't we all just get along?"" What was that about? Everyone was partying and getting along just fine. Lame.So the princess cries and tells mom that she's sorry (of course she is now that everything's a mess), and mom turns back into a person. But who has the character arc? Not the princess. The princess still does not want to get married. MOM is the one who changes, and she had better! After all, she knows that if she leans too hard on her daughter to do what's best, the daughter will drug her. So is that the lesson in the movie? Don't pressure your kids to do what you know is best for them, or they could get punitive. So mom caves in and says the young people can chose by falling in love. There's a ground-breaking moral. News flash: western women have not been getting betrothed for centuries.And why did they call the movie ""Brave"". The Princess didn't do anything brave in the whole movie. In fact, she had a hissy fit, ran from her responsibilities, and turned to drugs to solve the problems.I don't care if it was 6 years in the making, or how amazing the 3D effects were: the story was a dud.",Brave
335,cory-huff3897,"Brave - A stunningly beautiful, if albeit a tad predictable, adventure for the whole family",8,23 June 2012,"Brave tells the tale of Merida, a Scottish princess who is wrestling against her impending fate to be married as hard as she's wrestling with her mother, Elinor. Merida would much rather be wandering the country-side and practicing archery while riding her horse, Angus, than being tied up in corsets and presented to suitors. One day, after a particularly nasty fight with her mother, Merida stumbles upon a witches hut in the woods. Together they strike a deal to make a spell for Merida to change her fate, and well, things get a wee bit complicated.Merida marks PIXAR's first addition to the Disney princess pantheon. Time will tell how she resonates with that audience, but I think she's a worthy addition. Merida, as well as the rest of the cast, are beautifully animated and rendered, but not quite PIXAR's finest. It's kind of hard to judge them this way, since the company's forte has really been creating anthropomorphic characters. But The Incredibles managed to create some very interesting looking human characters and Brave's come up just a little short by comparison. Merida and her mother are really the center stage characters though, and their relationship is well crafted and engrossing. The real visual treats are the environments and the scenery. The natural beauty of Scotland really shines through the animator's use of the areas lush forests and greenery. The scenes with Merida just riding through the woods or climbing a hill are absolutely spectacular.Of special note is the soundtrack, which is beautiful on all accounts. The violin, fiddles, flutes, and bagpipes are melded together by Patrick Doyle to create something almost transformative. I've always been a fan of traditional Scottish music for its ability to paint a vivid and mystical picture with some very unique sounds, and Doyle's score is no exception. When mixed with the mountains and the rivers and the majesty of Scotland, the combination is extraordinarily breathtaking.Unfortunately, the same cannot be said about the story, which gets a little mundane by around the halfway point. It's not boring by any means, but it does begin to feel a little standard. It's about the point that Merida meets the witch that things become a little derivative, but this is really only so evident because the beginning of the movie is so good. While not a backwards slide in narrative at this point, it is a bit of a plateau that holds steady until the end. Brave is still a great cautionary tale for young women (and their mothers too) about riding the fine line of making your own way, but doing it without trampling on the people that got you where you are. It's just going to feel more than a little familiar in the end. Don't get me wrong though. Brave is an excellent movie and I'd highly recommend it to the old and the young alike. We'll certainly be seeing it again at sometime, and will definitely own it when it's released for home viewing. Something can be found in Brave to entertain the whole family, and that is really where PIXAR shines. They don't pander to either the kids or the parents, and instead set out to make a real film with mature themes, that are boiled down in essence for everyone to understand. The result is always a mix that resonates well with everyone. Brave's problem is that it's only great compared to extraordinary. PIXAR has really spoiled us with the quality of their products since Toy Story all those years ago. But at the end of the day, a second rate PIXAR movie is still better than the majority of other features produced by the Hollywood system, and that's a pretty good position to be in.Follow me on Twitter @Mrhuffsmyfather for more movie reviews!",Brave
336,sajin_kc,Brave : A Pixar Gemstone In Animation,8,16 November 2012,"A very good movie by Pixar Animation Studios and Walt Disney.I loved it.The movie is an audio visual delight.I gracefully request and recommend.""Fate be changed, look inside, mend the bond, broken by pride"".The movie is about a very different, courageous and passionate Princess who is brave enough to follow her heart, her inner voice, brave enough to create her own destiny, her own fate.Its also about a girl(the Princess) and a loving caring mother(the Queen).Its a heartwarming adventure that will help them rediscover each other, care for each other, listen to each other, understand each other and mend broken bonds between them not only for the love they have for each other but also to save the entire Kingdom from falling apart, to mend old bonds broken by pride, to free them from a curse and to keep them all united.The movie is different and special for its plot, its charm, its profound theme and immaculate characters.The soundtrack and great work on the little details bring life to the movie.A movie that will stay with us for a very long time ever charming, ever glowing.",Brave
337,nightbiker-1,Extremely enjoyable experience!,8,8 July 2012,"Being big fans of animation, my wife and I always try to catch animated movies -especially those which are digitally so. Animated movies more so than most, tend to be ""hit or miss"" and with this one, Pixar has a definite 'HIT'. The story is engaging, the characters (even ancillary ones) are interesting, and there weren't any 'dead' spots where you wished things would just move along to the next scene. It was just plain fun. Most telling (in my view) is this: I cannot recall the last time I saw a movie and didn't see a lot of dimwits texting or playing with their phones. If you like animated movies that actually have a story (not just pretty flashes of color and loud noises) you will like this one.",Brave
338,gsxr-1000,Better Ending,5,12 November 2012,"The film is good but I found the girl annoying and a brat attitude, shame because she could have changed during the film to be a lovable character, I guess having a fifteen year old daughter myself shes at the age where everything is an argument, her attitude reminded me and the wife of our daughter many times. Hopefully and luckily they grow up and lose the attitude.I think the story would have been so much better if the gathering had captured Mor-du in the circle of stones, Merida stops them from killing Mor-du while merida and the sons run to get the large broken stone, join it back together(like they did the tapestry) which lifts the spell from the prince, he is returned to a prince (Charming and handsome not aged obviously) and Merida and him live happily ever after....Just a thought....",Brave
339,kewlmatto,'Brave' is a simple tale well told - a bit more 'Disney' than 'Pixar',8,16 June 2012,"After the highly disappointing 'Cars 2', it is nice to see an original film from Pixar once again. The burden Pixar carries is their near perfect hit-after-hit track record, and the company is clearly beginning to feel the pressure of this amazing output.If you come with giddy expectations you may be let down a little - Brave is a thoroughly enjoyable film but it's just far more 'ordinary' in its delivery and themes than other Pixar films. This in many ways is its strength - its simplicity actually works well. But at its core lies themes that we've seen before, told in very similar ways. It is here where the film feels much more like a well-made Disney Animation Studio film than a Pixar one - almost like a follow-up to Tangled.The animation is beautiful, the film doesn't overstay its welcome, and, given the film's problems during production, it's great to see something this coherent.What I really appreciated was the mother-daughter relationship which is the focus of the film. This was not really clear in the advertising - in fact, it seems they would have us believe it's a father/daughter themed movie from the trailers. Apparently talking about mothers and daughters is box-office poison.It's refreshing. We all know about the Disney curse on mothers. Instead of following suit, this film, with the immense heart and talent of Emma Thompson, carves out a wonderful role for Queen Elinor, and the relationship between her and her daughter Merida develops some rich layers as the film progresses.Expect a good film and you will be happy with this one. Expect the best film and you will be underwhelmed. It's all about perspective.",Brave
340,titimaida,A great movie. Extremely underrated,9,29 July 2020,"This agreat story, just not the typical disney story. It has no love in, at least not romantic love and people cannot seem to like a movie without it. Yes, the plot can be basic and predictable but as like every other animated film. Its an amazing movie that touches lots of topics and that was a big eye opener for my young me about family and the role of women. The anima5ion and visual of it is AMAZING.
Give it a chance. But dont expect a tangled-like kind of love story because you are not getting that. In my opinion you are getting something much more interesting. You will not regret it",Brave
341,christmas-10,Good but not great...,6,29 June 2012,"The backdrop for the movie and the music are enchanting and lovely. As for the storyline, the challenges our protagonist faces, They are a little confusing. She has a few antagonists to deal with. First, this is a coming of age movie, Merida battles the traditions of her culture as far as a choosing a suitor, But she doesn't find a suitor, at all. Second, she deals with her strained relationship with her mother, this is the central struggle within the movie, a theme that is rarely explored in fairytaledom. Personally, I don't think it hit the mark as firmly as the father son relationship in Finding Nemo. Lastly, Merida unlocks the mystery of a Tale about her culture from years ago. Bottom line, the movie has too many different Antagonistic elements that aren't fully developed throughout the storyline. The film will definitely sit among the staples of the media of choice for young people, but I don't think it's been the best product that Pixar has delivered.",Brave
342,sford605,Wonderful,10,23 June 2012,"All right, let me start off by saying that I am a huge Disney and Pixar fan. I also have extremely high standards in the movies I watch. That being said, this movie is a fantastic success.Animation. The animation (I saw it in 2D so I cannot comment on the 3D) was excellent. There were times when I thought it could have been better (but only by a little), but more often than not I was blown away by its beauty and detail.Soundtrack. The score was composed by Patrick Doyle. The score was amazing- especially if you really enjoy Scottish music. The singing was very good. I know some people were not impressed because there was a genuine Scottish accent, but I did not mind. I thought it was still great.Character Development. The characters were developed very well. By the end of the film you felt as if you knew the characters as well as you would had you known them in person. Moreover, all the characters were very likable.Storyline. The story (as you could tell from the trailer) deals with Princess Merida trying to escape her fate of marrying awkward princes that she does not care for, fighting a bear, and trying to undo a spell. The real heart of the story though, is in the conflict and love between Merida and her mother, the queen. I won't say more or I'll have to add a spoiler alert, but rest assured that the storyline is quite good and well developed.Child Friendliness. For the most part it is child friendly. There isn't really any blood, gore, or bad language that I can remember. There are, however, a few moments that you should be aware of if you have young children. Due to strange circumstances you do see some of the men walking by with their rears exposed. There are one or two more similar moments.Overall, here is my opinion. The movie is touching, funny, exciting, and interesting. 10/10 stars",Brave
343,alimurtaza780,Just one word Amazing,9,24 July 2012,I watched this movie in 3D and all I have to say is Awesome .It is a great movie for families . I would say that most children and specially their parents would like it.It is again a job well done by Disney and Pixar. OK the characters needed some improvement but the story was very very very strong . I can't wait for the Blu-ray 3D release . This is a must see movie.A very nice movie for families . Very nice 3D effects. Great story line. Overall I give it a 9 because characters needed improvement Well the next upcoming movie of Disney that I await is Wreck It Ralph and the current trailer is Awesome .,Brave
344,stantonchris4,ehhh,5,10 July 2013,"this movie proved that pixar can make average movies from time to time. not that this movie was bad, I just think it could have been a lot stronger. But there are some things that work about the story. The animation like all pixar animation is really impressive and pretty to look at. Another thing is the side characters from all the clans that try to win over Merida got a few good laughs every now and then. But sadly, there are some things I don't like about the movie that usually pixar does well. For one thing, the story is not very good. the pacing is really inconsistent and it's not very original. They seem to take a lot of elements from other Disney films including all the princess movies and even brother frickin bear! yes, there is a spell that turns merida's mom into a bear, and I did not enjoy that part of the story because it took up a good chunk of the movie, and it wasn't very funny or creative. The other thing is the characters are really not all that interesting and a lot of them you just forget about as soon as the movie is done. By regular movie standards, it's OK, but by pixar standards, this movie isn't all that great. It makes me really mad that this won best animated picture over wreck it ralph, which was a lot better, more original,and a lot more funny. Brave was just average. Well, overall I would say this isn't terrible, but it is pixar's weakest and really overrated. Watch it one time but don't expect too much.",Brave
345,toontje-1,Pixar's worst,3,29 August 2012,"Pixar dropped the ball on this one. Don't get me wrong, it is still entertaining for kids, but it should also appeal to the parents that has to through this movie. Pixar used to tell multi layered stories, but instead this time we get a run of the mill princess story complete with what sounds like mock Scottish accents (I know that some of the voice actors are Scottish but I never heard mock Chinese coming from Mulan).The visuals are breathtaking, however that isn't a qualifier anymore these days. Pixar used to use visuals as a story telling aid but Merida's hair just stood in the way, taking for what it seems a third of screen space at anytime. Subtlety is an art (i.e little things like floating specks in Nemo makes the underwater world so believable), and this time alas, the went for the butt jokes.I left the movie feeling that the story felt disconnected, wait.... it felt like a direct to video movie!",Brave

347,Nbrayton17,"Not Pixar's Weakest, don't fall victim to the hate",9,14 July 2012,"Pixar really can't do any wrong. Brave marks the 13th time a Pixar film has taken the top spot at the box office. That's everyone one of their films starting with Toy Story.Brave tells the classic story of all teenagers and their relationships with their parents. Merida, a Scottish Princess, wants to be free to choose her suitor, much like in Aladin. Out of frustration, she turns to a witch who promises to change her fate and mother, Queen Elinor, who want's Merida to act more like a princess and spend less time shooting her bow. And everyone knows, you can't trust witches who promise you your greatest desires.Quickly after casting a spell on her mother, Merida regrets her little mistake. However, something good does come out of the spell. Merida and Elinor get to spend quality time together, while actually taking the time the listen to each other under ""unique circumstances"".Brave does a great job of capturing the dynamics of any stereotypical family. It showcases a whiney teenage girls, three reckless and spoiled sons, a controlling mother, and an oblivious father. And that is truly the magic of Pixar. While the movie is entertaining and has good themes for children, anyone can enjoy Brave.After watching all of the trailers and a few TV spots for Brave, I was surprised of some of the plot turns. Now, I can't reveal anything here with out spoiling anything but I will say it was unexpected but like Pixar usually does, they make 'strange' work.Some things to point out:This is the first Pixar film with a female protagonist. I think that's a great step for Pixar industry.I really enjoyed the commination of the great score with the soft-rock singles. It reminded me a little of Tarzan.Merida's hair was amazing.It was way funnier than I thought it was going to be.Overall, Brave was brilliant. Definitely a good time. I can't talk about too much without spoling the movie.It ranks at least in my top 3 Pixar films. Take your family to see it, but be prepared for cuteness overload.9.5 of 10""I don't want to get married, I want to stay single and let my hair flow in the wind as I ride through the glen firing arrows into the sunset.""",Brave
348,rdeveza-50499,Best CGI Movie since the first Toy Story,8,27 June 2021,"The original Toy Story might not ever be surpassed by another Computer Generated Imagery movie, but Brave, is certainly, close.",Brave
349,waldwuffel-1,"By far not Pixar's best, but neither their worst",8,5 August 2012,"Pixar movies still are a league of their own, even after their first ""bad"" movie that was Cars 2, but with Brave, they still have not recovered to their former glory. The movie is solid, and when it comes to the technical part, there are few companies that can even remotely mess with Pixar. Each of their movies shows a remarkable leap in technology, and Brave is no exception. Even though the movie's animation gimmik falls a bit on the sort side (comparing it to say, Finding Nemo's underwater theme and ""Up""'s Balloons), it is astonishing non the less: Meredith's hair is incredibly detailed and looks both real and comically overdrawn at the same time. The character's expressions are also a new standard for Pixar movies, and are only topped to this day by Tintin. What made this movie not play in their top tier is the fact that the story and the execution are a little bit on the shallow side. You could say: Disney-esque. The film's mother-daughter conflict (as well as the one tradition vs. freedom) are just a little too blunt and direct, and are without much metaphor or a second level of thought, predictable both in development and execution. The movie loses a lot of momentum after Meridith's mother has turned into a bear, and where the movie fails absolutely and miserably is in the development of the bad guy, because there is really none. In the first quarter, it is established that there used to be one of four brothers who went to be the bad guy, and the moment the queen is turned into a bear, it is clear that the bear we see in the beginning that eats the king's leg is that brother. Almost no development went into that character, his motivations or his interactions and relations with the other characters, other than Meredith's father hating him and being out for revenge. The film would have done better without him, but it seems they felt it was too unconventional to not have an antagonist. And this is the movies main problem: not only for a Pixar movie, but for a movie in general, it is too conventional. This is not really saved by the fact that the protagonist is female, as, sadly, Meredith is a rather replacable character. Other than her wild, curly red hair, she does not bring much into the game of making her stand out of the ocean of all other Disney princesses. As a side-note: Even the witch is extraordinarily clichée - and one of the most clichée characters I have seen in a whole while - with a broomstick, comically disfigured, humpy appearance and even a ravenbird - one that talks, no less - as a pet. All this ranting may make it sound like I did not like the movie. Like I said, I did, and very much so. It was a very good movie. One of the reasons I get so worked up about the issues I mentioned is the fact that that movie had a lot more potential, and it is unusual for Pixar to be so undaring and conventional. Even Cars 2, while being not a good movie, was daring enough in many aspects as to give it a different feel to it than the first Cars. I simply fear that Disney's influence on Pixar might become too firm, and that one day we will just have them bring out direct to video sequels of all their establisehd IP. Alas, this is not the case yet, and this being both their first historical piece as well as the first movie with a female protagonist, I give them the benefit of the doubt and assume that they have not figured out the details yet on how to handle this new material. After all, the ending is open enough to allow for a sequel, which we will undoubtedly see some day. When talking in Pixar standards: 6/10 when talking regular standards (which is my rating here on IMDb) 8/10",Brave
350,Balzer13,Wanted SO much to like it,3,22 June 2012,"Just took my twin 13 year old daughters to see Brave and we all wanted to like it but the film didn't help us much. Pixar is kind of the Stanley Kubrick of animation studios. Meaning they have been so preternaturally stunning with each of their films, they have set the bar so high, with so many ground breaking, narratively bulletproof films, that when they turn out an ill conceived, bland, and sadly boring film like this, we give it less leeway than we would other mortal film companies like Dreamworks Animation or even Disney. I'm sure Kubrick felt the pressure later in his career to create greatness as much as Pixar head John Lassiter does. And much like Kubrick's streak of great films, maybe Pixar's run as come to a close as well.And the fact that it is such a utter cookie cutter entry like Disney has been turning out for years is alarming considering John Lassiter is now running both Pixar and Disney Animation. I hope he isn't spread too thin and being tainted by the lost and wandering Disney brand.I'm not sure why Pixar felt the need to get into the uber saturated princess business. Kinda seen every permutation of that story a few times over. The only thing I could say as a positive on the film, is that the animation of the princess herself is first rate, her luminescent skin, her flowing red hair, is quite an accomplishment. And that might have been enough for another studio, but Pixar has to hit it out of the park each time which has got to be kind of daunting but that's what comes along with greatness I guess.",Brave
351,CumClarity,"Best animated movie in ages, inspiring and strong!",9,24 June 2012,"I haven't felt so inspired after a animated pg film in ages! There were strong female leads, without being clichéd. The Merdia and the queen are very likable and realistic characters (as realistic as an animated can be), strong of mind and body.The movie starts off strong and beautiful and ends the same. there's some slap stick humor in there, mainly for the kids benefit, but it didn't drag on like it does in some kids movies. It had me as an adult laughing as well.The scenery was lush, green and vibrant, with some dark forested area. Beautiful. I also liked that they incorporated ""fates"" instead of fairies which was refreshing and nice to see other cultures in mainstream films.I found it most akin to Monsters Inc, because it had that same feel good message, and more subdued slapstick (unlike Shrek)I took my 7 years old daughter and while there were a few frightening scenes, my daughter loved it.I cried like a baby at a few scenes.It had heart, plot and great voices!",Brave
352,bakor24-1,Not as bad a disappointment as Cars 2,5,28 August 2012,"I went to watch Brave having completely forgotten the last major failure from Pixar, Cars 2. I had hope that the creative talent there would know how to return to the level of engaging creativity as seen in Toys 3 and Wall-E. I was wrong; the film was entirely too formulaic, trying to fit in too much of what typically works in a movie that couldn't bear it all. The pace is far too fast, the movie is far too unfocused, and major elements of the story line are breezed through without giving them the proper time to develop an importance in the viewer's mind. The random, tasteless and cheap slapstick comedy added to my grievance. The movie is about a daughter's relationship with her mother and father. That's what the film should've preserved it's attention on, but the director also felt the urge to include a story involving the father and his nemesis. Truly, the only amazing elements about this movie were the success in digitizing such curly hair and the beautiful natural scenery. Unfortunately, in terms of story telling, there was more failure than success.",Brave
353,Henbaine,Brave the bad reviews- it's worth your time!,7,14 August 2013,"Despite many negative views, I decided to watch this movie, mainly due to boredom but also I do love all things Celtic and mythical.I won't go into as much detail as I have with some reviews but just highlight the good, bad and in-between points as I saw themFirstly, the good: The animation is gorgeous as is the music. I love the backdrop and can related to the freedom of climbing cliffs and standing under waterfalls etc as I have done these things and felt incredible.As someone who loves nature and freedom I felt the main character Merida was not so unbelievable. I actually can relate well to the strenuous relationship she has with her mother and her father being stuck in the middle keeping the peace. The story line starts off very well and has a nice heartwarming and resolved if not predictable ending.There is a good sense of myth, moral and culture which is rare in movies these days. The story is simple but quite clever in a way that everything does still link nicely together if you really look at the imagery. I understand the original title was not ""Brave"" but ""The Bear and the Bow"" which is more what it says on the tin but hey. There IS bravery, physical bravery in tackling ones enemies in combat-but also the emotional-to face your own misgivings and admit you are wrong, to be willing to change your close and comfortable outlook on life and take risks,and to always stand up for what you believe in no matter what. Shame some people seemed to have missed this point. The not so good:I felt the story line was too predictable (good for kids maybe but adults will guess it almost from the off) and things just fall into place too easily,even the end ""battle"" is resolved far too quickly & easily. Also, sadly as time advance it becomes a little too silly & gimmicky in parts (Did we really need the naughty siblings- and did we REALLY need them becoming bears!?)or the stock neurotic overweight maid and clumsy,easily swayed but well meaning side characters? Shame because while bringing some comedic relief,all were quite forgettable and served as a tired cliché this movie could have soared without.It lacks the epic standing the trailers promised. Also, the men are depicted as blundering fools with no looks, sense,or charisma, the ladies- yep, the opposite.(However- it was refreshing to see this in a way as many animations have shown women as weak and feeble totally relying on men and princes- Merida not only does not rely on her version of Mr charming-she shuns the very notion of losing her freedom!)SO,to sum up- Slightly lacking substance but still a very good family movie.Aesthetically striking,nice and light hearted but with some more moving lesson on attitudes and the value of your friends and loved ones.",Brave
354,Apollocandybar,Very sub-par for Pixar,4,23 June 2012,"Our family loves Pixar films, so we eagerly anticipated the release of 'Brave.' However, we were very disappointed. It is the worst Pixar film we've ever seen.The main character, Merida, is not a lovable heroine like Mulan; instead, she is a whining, bratty child. She has no endearing qualities like one would find in Snow White or Belle.The plot does not make sense, either. Merida doesn't want to get married and believes if she changes her mother's mind on the matter, she won't have to. Nevermind the culture of the time and pressures of her father and her political system, right? It's nonsense that changing her mother's mind would have any effect on whether or not she'd have to get married.We hadn't read a lot of reviews before going, so we were a little surprised by the whole plot, which is that Merida's mother is turned into a bear by Merida's selfish act of poisoning her with a cake she gets from a witch. The mother dealing with being in the bear body is funny for about thirty seconds. Unfortunately, it goes on for the majority of the film.I guess we're supposed to see that mother and daughter find common ground in the woods and come to respect each other. However, emotionally, the film is completely flat. You will not find the loving family bonds from The Incredibles here! And forget about the heart string tugs you saw in Up... not happening in Brave.The accents are over the top. Yeah, I get it, they're Scottish. But we're not. They could have toned that down a little.The potty humor and grotesque portrayal of EVERY adult male in the film made it feel more like a lower-class Dreamworks film than a Pixar/Disney.Overall, very disappointing. Had it been a Dreamworks, it would have been maybe a 7/10, but Pixar has set the bar so high with other films, that we really expected better.",Brave
355,DoctorNordo,Beautiful animation can't make up for the lame feminist storyline,3,1 February 2013,"Before anything else I will get the good stuff out of the way. Brave is a beautifully animated film. The characters and textures are all very detailed and nice to look at and the landscapes are, quite simply, breathtaking. The Celtic scenery is incredibly lush and just really pops out. Visually, this movie is stunning. If the technical aspect of how this movie was drawn was the only metric used to assign a score, Brave would be a 10/10. Yet alas, there is also this little thing called ""plot"" that also has to be taken into consideration.The first 20 or 30 minutes aren't all that bad. The story at least is coherent by that point if not good. The bulk of the story ends up centered around the heroine's mother being transformed into a bear and their quest to reverse the spell (by repairing their mother/daughter relationship) before the deadline makes her new form permanent. Nonsensical slapstick ensues. Seriously, was that really the best the writers could come up with? A bear?! Ugh...so stupid.The worst aspects of this movie, by far, are the attitude of the heroine and the depiction of the film's male characters. Every single one of the men in this movie is portrayed negatively. The most favorably depicted male character is the father, Fergus, who while being a competent warrior is also a bumbling, stupid, savage, lovable idiot who jumps whenever his wife cracks the whip. The other males are even worse, notably the suitors and their fathers. They are all portrayed as pathetic, ugly, oafish morons who spin incredible lies in order to make themselves seem competent. Meanwhile, the women are shown to be just the opposite - calm, rational, beautiful, collected, competent.Merida is the worst, which is unfortunate since 90% of the screen time is devoted to her. She is one of the most selfish main characters I have ever seen in a movie. She is unwilling to accept responsibility and is willing to risk the lives of thousands of people as well as the stability of the entire kingdom and to poison her mother all to shirk her responsibility to her kingdom. And she even steals the ""positive"" physical characteristics of the men by trouncing the suitors in archery and besting her father in a sword fight.So basically the moral of this story is ""screw everyone else, it's all about me me me me me,"" and ""women can do anything men can do, and they can do it better, and they can do it in heels."" Basically Feminism 101.Seriously, don't waste your time with this nonsense.",Brave
356,saranyavalsarajan,cheers to girl power,6,22 June 2012,"Girls of the 21st century will definitely be able to connect to Merida, the protagonist of Disney Pixar's new offer, Brave. Merida is a princess, even if she likes it or not. She is an excellent archer and a head strong girl and most importantly there are no qualities in her that can make her an absolute Princess. That's what her mother thinks. Merida is no simpering beauty nor she follows the etiquette of a princess, yet you end up liking her character. Brave narrates the story of Merida who loves to live her life to the fullest according to her heart. And for this, she is even ready to break the traditions of her family. But she ends up doing something for which she has only less time to amend it. With movies like Toy Story, WALL-E, Finding Nemo in the hit list, Brave is a slight disappointment from Disney Pixar. The producers always had something new to offer, but this time, they gave us what was already told which resembles to Little Mermaid. It also tells the tale of a girl who likes to live life on her terms. Brave has great technicality and beautiful visuals. But that does not seem to be enough to impress. The music is not really impressive and the dialogues are plain. This is the first time that Pixar showcased female as the protagonist and indeed she is convincing and also an inspiration to growing girls to choose what they like. But at the same having their bond attached to the family. After all said and done, the movie offers a message for growing kids. And hence, let them take that message with this red haired beauty.",Brave

However, i found myself being swayed by bad reviews from viewers, even if the critic reviews remained steady.Finally, a couple years after release, i found a copy for 2 euros at a flea market. Thus i found myself watching Brave for the first time.Apparently the people handing in bad reviews were watching ""another film"" called Brave, because i could not see how it could be this one they were talking about.First of all the animation was out of this world. Especially the rugged Scottish scenery and attention to detail.But the thing i found most surprising was the fantastic story line which had me paying vivid attention throughout...and this was what most people complained about??? It was a great story about independence and learning to accept differences (interjected with some mystery, history and a little bit of wonderful silliness).Finally i must mention that i laughed out loud on a least 12 separate occasions! In my opinion...Well done again Pixar!! Give this one a go.",Brave

A few flashes from Billy Connolly's character and Merida's mute little brothers, but that was it.We don't expect much in the way of wit/irony from Disney, but we have learned to expect an extra layer from Pixar that just wasn't there. And that's why I left the cinema thinking ""Is that it?"" Age-wise, it would be okay for most kids from about eight upwards - but much of the film is very dark and ranges from quite spooky(with supernatural themes) to straight out scary.Roll on Ice Age 4 and Madagascar 3 ...Oh, and IMDb, I know you're American, but there is really no need to try to get me to correct perfectly good English spelling.

Every day they make things look even more realistic.

And as expected...Snow White who?? Merida all the way! If both characters were to be compared it would make a case of proton meets electron. Brushing character comparisons aside, THE FILM is your typical visual treat for the kids with nice underlying morals (but overdoing it a li'l wee bit). This animated tale of the feisty archer will definitely make for a good weekend trip to the cinema theater, but sadly only once. The film stumbles slightly in maintaining the tempo of the story. There are moments where kids might momentarily doze off or you might want to shove in a couple of loo breaks in between. Pixar has always maintained great standards in making such movies, whether it be animation or story-wise. So I might just warn that if you are looking for another Pixar movie which might blow your socks off, better hold back your expectations and you might just love it!",Brave
366,evanz2,"End of Pixar? No, just a break.",6,7 July 2012,"As an avid Pixar fan, I was naturally excited for the announcement of their 2012 release, ""The Bear and The Bow"". When they changed the name to ""Brave"" and changed directors, I got a bit worried. Then I saw the trailer and found myself stuck in a confused mood. From the basic plot, it seemed like just another Disney princess movie. And I was only half right.Brave is about a young Scottish princess trying to change her destiny of becoming just like her mother. She goes about this by visiting a witch and buying a spell to 'change' her mother. She feeds her mother the spell, and the Queen is turned into a bear. I won't go too far in to avoid too many spoilers.The characters in ""Brave"" are very believable, and the movie's fantastic visuals made me feel like I was in Scotland. However, once the plot got going, I found myself lost in a world of beautiful landscapes, re-used/predictable plots, and almost-funny humor.I could complain more about how the plot is basically the same as any other Disney movie, but most movies have re-used plots these days. So I'll give that a pass.When the Queen morphed into a bear, I knew that she and her daughter were going to become best friends after they learned about one another, and I even saw the Queen slipping from reality into 'bear-hood' coming. But the movie had just enough kick to keep me almost interested, and I was sort of excited to see if the Queen would lighten up on her daughter (even though I saw this coming).When I saw Merida's family in the trailer, I thought I was going to dislike their characters. The triplets? Yeah, they reminded me of those stupid yellow bean things from ""Despicable Me"". However, the family felt like a real one, and the triplets weren't even slightly annoying. I did appreciate Merida's relationship with her father, making a movie with a female protagonist likable to young boys as well as girls. However, Merida's Father is quick to claim his daughter is a liar when she warns him about the Bear Queen. He rushes off in a forced plot-point to kill the bear (the Queen) even after Merida explained the whole movie to him.Many complain that ""Brave"" is the birth of 'Pixney', described as an evil corporation selling out on every level possible. I disagree with these overreactions. I say that ""Brave"", along with their ""can't even be called a film"" sequel to Cars, is just a break from the norm. Any company's first goal is to make money, and Pixar is no exception. I believe that the last two 'products' by Pixar have been made to meet the goal of making millions of dollars, and by the box office they have met his goal. So I say they are just saving up to make new movies that bring us back to the glory days of Pixar. The reveal of ""Monsters University"" might prove my point.Final recommendation: Go see it if you have a family with young kids. Don't see it if you are a teenager, or a lonely adult Pixar fan without kids.",Brave
367,Spazplayer20,Great step back in right direction for Disney.,8,18 March 2013,"BRAVE is a decent example of the type of deep, emotional films Disney USED to make. Pixar Movies have never, at least for me, ever reached an emotional level as that of many Disney films. The combination of Pixar's brilliant animation and Disney charm really make me feel that BRAVE is a decent step back in the right direction. Disney, in my opinion, has lacked in the story department for the last 10 years. Brother Bear (2003) being the last remarkable and deep plot. BRAVE shows much of Brother Bear and its components of love, forgiveness, and tolerance.Disney films, and basically every Pixar film, being released has a shallow, un-relatable plot. Toy Story very slimly being an exception. Disney needs to get back to making the types of movies which made it how popular it is today. Getting back to these universal ideas and themes would improve the quality of future content. The attention to the story needs to be increased, instead of focusing on creating marketable characters. Really, what Disney animated film won't be successful in this day and age. Disney is big enough to be able to sacrifice marketability for substance. I like to FEEL something, anything while watching a film. BRAVE I can happily say, gave me chills. I have yet to feels this with really any Pixar film or any Disney film in the past 10 years.Overall, BRAVE is a great step back in the right direction for Disney. Now the only thing to do is wait and see whether or not they realize the good thing they've stumbled upon.",Brave

But in general, it was just a touch too short and I didn't get a lot out of it, and personally, I think Pixar could have done A LOT better. It's not that Brave isn't a good movie, it's just that instead of being the usual ""Pixar great"", Brave was just well, ""good"". Because it was only like 98 minutes long, the film didn't have the important parts that makes some movie great like world building and the relationships between some characters. It just feels lacking in both plot and meaning. But in the end, Brave WAS a good movie so go and check it out if you haven't already and I hope you found this review helpful.",Brave
369,www-marinouniki,Not among Pixar's best,6,24 December 2016,"Oh, Brave. One of my least favourite Pixar films. Not that is terrible, it is pretty decent, but I'm just not into it. It copies Disney's unoriginal ""plucky princess doesn't want to do what she is told"" and honestly I expected better from Pixar.I've got to say, the animation is superb. I could marvel at Brave gifs for hours without ever getting bored. Also, Merida's design is a breath of fresh air. She's not very beautiful, she has impractical curly hair, and she's not skinny on physically impossible level. That's pretty original. What't not original about her, is her stubbornness ad willfulness, which is not bad, just overused. I am not fan of getting married to someone I don't know either, but Merida's characterisation... makes her come off as a spoiled, teenage brat instead of the brave heroine we're meant to root for. Especially since it's implied she's the heiress to her father's kingdom, which means she couldn't care less about the good of her people, and that's being presented as OK because... reasons. And then there's the whole turning-the-mother-into-a-bear issue. As I said, I totally understand Merida's objection to marrying someone she doesn't know. But that doesn't give her the right to change people. When she went to that witch, her intention was to change her mother - that is, bind the mother's will to hers. Um, nope. Elinor is a free person, with her own free will and Merida has no right to deprive her of that. I'm all in for taking one's fate into one's hand, but not to the expense of others', thank you very much.So, in the end, Merida is a spoiled, self-entitled brat who considers her problems as greater than everybody else's, and puts her well- being above the good of the many. She endangers her mother's life, and in the end, she still gets what she wants. She makes up for her own mistakes (that no-one else had the obligation to clean up) and is applauded for that, as if it was a selfless action on her behalf, whereas it truly wasn't. And in the last scene, we see Elinor with her hair loose, obviously changed, as if the problem lied with her, when Merida wasn't in the right the whole time, but is treated like she was. In the end, everyone must learn a lesson and change slightly their view of the world... except for Merida, who is rewarded for putting the queen in danger. Even the parallelism with the other dude, Mor'du, draws Elinor as the problem. The carved stone was broken, separating him from his family, and then Merida tears her mother's tapestry, it is Elinor who gets separated from her husband, daughter and sons, as if she's the one causing the chaos, when in fact it's Merida.Brave has some breath-taking animation, goo voice-acting and score, but in terms of story-line, it's not that original, it doesn't bring anything new to the table, and can it's heroine may be one of the most irritating characters the Disney pantheon has to offer. Not that it isn't suitable for a movie night with your friends and pop- corn.",Brave

When was the last time a kids show had a male hero that wasn't in some way arrogant needing to be knocked down a notch (Tangled, Cars,Buzz Lightyear etc)or a weak anti-hero that realizes he needs help (Woody, Nemo's Dad, etc.Make a movie with a classic male hero and that would be mold breaking.

But it is nowhere near Pixar standard. Without the 3D element, I would have thought I was watching a direct-to-video animation on Disney Channel.Admittedly, part of Pixar's success came from their used-to-be unmatchable vibrant graphics. But the real charm has always, always been the stories. I used to cry when heard ""When she loved me"", now at the end of Brave I just want to laugh my butt off.

You just knew there would be no way she'd end up with any of her bumbling comical suitors. Instead, in spite of her rebellious behavior, she reconciled her feelings for her mother and both of them learned from each other. Merida was a true liberated girl, smart and skilled in the art of archery, proving her inner strength and character.I know this may be a stretch but I couldn't help but be reminded of the chapter (I think it was 13) in Don Quixote when Marcella confronts a group of men about to lay to rest the dead young man of the village, Chrysostom, who has died (supposedly of a broken heart) for love of Marcella.

375,dominique-alvarillo16,A must-see family movie,8,24 August 2012,"I've been watching Pixar movies since I'm not exactly sure when and I love the short movies that come before them.Before the start of this movie is a short movie called La Luna. It's about a boy who is coming of age and is brought to work for the first time by his father and grandfather. It's set at sea, where they row a wooden boat far out with no land in plain sight and then stops and waits. But something else awaits him, which makes the boy unsure of whose footsteps he should follow or pave a path of his own.Disney's Pixar Animations movie, Brave, is about a princess named Merida living in Scotland. She is a free-spirited girl who prefers to do archery in her spare time from princess lessons taught by her own mother, Queen Elinor. Her father, King Fergus is a comic in the story where all the fun and laughs come from. What's great about this film is that young adults can relate to Merida. They understand how it feels not to be treated the way they feel they deserve or should be treated simply because they are seen as kids who should only follow and not be heard.When Merida meets the witch in the forest she asks for a spell to change her mother's opinion on her fate of getting married, unfortunately for her it did not satisfy her for instead of gaining a solution she made her problem into an even bigger issue. But she mends two bonds towards the end, one with the tapestry, which she tore with her sword, and the other with her relationship with her mother.Merida isn't ready to get married yet and couldn't talk to her mother about it. Her mother is traditional and keeps to her conservative ways and hopes that her daughter would follow her footsteps. But Merida is too adventurous her princess ways and wants to lead her own life as do any kid. What she doesn't know is that not all good things come just when we take the lead although she did teach her mum a few tricks for surviving in the woods when the unfortunate change happened to the queen. Here, we can see that both sides can learn something from each other once we take the time to listen and understand what we're trying to say. Make them see what we see, make them feel how we feel.It is only this theme of the film that I like to emphasis since it is what is also emphasized in the movie with all the dramatic effects such as Merida crying, everyone in the background falling silent, emotional music, and close-ups to the main characters and their long faces. However, it's not all tears but laughter too as I've said earlier. I love the triplets the most both in human form and as bear cubs. They're your typical rowdy kids who love to run around and play and just have fun. Even you have fun with them messing around with one of the helpers by taking the food tray and such. So that's it for now. I'm leaving you with a trailer of the film. Enjoy!",Brave

377,nokkenbuer,The Perfect Film,10,2 July 2012,"""Brave"" is a phenomenal movie by Disney and Pixar Animation Studios. The quality of this film, from the perfected graphics to the deep storyline and everything surrounding it, is beyond any expectation I had conceived before walking into the theater. I honestly anticipated the content and characters to be a bit immature and lackluster for a more mature audience, but I was proved very wrong. The plot is quite complex for a children's movie and definitely one that will invoke strong emotions. I felt anger, despair, excitement, fear, and joy throughout the course of this awe inspiring flick, something very surprising due to the fact that this is coming from an individual who often considers himself emotionally calloused.The graphics of this film was more amazing than any other animated movie I've ever seen before. The strong underlying messages recurring throughout the story (i.e., forgiveness, faith, independence, open-mindedness, etc.) were powerful and prevalent; contrary to the concept that animated children's films are often childish (I being guilty of such thinking), ""Brave"" defies that by conveying meaningful concepts while still keeping the movie kid- friendly and comprehensible for younger viewers.My opinion may be a bit biased, of course, because I'm a big enthusiast of Germanic history, especially that of the Celts and their fascinating culture. Nonetheless, I can assure you that the myths and views depicted in Brave are accurate to the Celtic society and culture. ""Brave"" is a movie both children and adults will thoroughly enjoy. If you get the chance to see it in theaters (especially in IMAX 3D), then by all means go for it!TL;DR – ""Brave"" is a great animated film and I consider it my favorite Disney/Pixar movie of all time. The graphics are beyond amazing and the Celtic roots depicted are accurate to the history that inspired it. A lot of strong emotions will be felt throughout the course of the story and powerful messages, such as forgiveness, independence, and freedom, are conveyed in a strong albeit kid-friendly manner. Both children and adults will love this cinematographic work of art and you will DEFINITELY NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!",Brave
378,arrowhead12272,Perfect,9,27 June 2012,"Brave is moving. Princess Merida is a great heroine.. The visual effects are perfect, in my opinion, the best of ail the Pixar films.Brave cleverly twists what we think think a Disney Princess can be. It's funny and smart. The directing was perfect. The big scope is very impressive and it was very emotional. I was rooting for her the whole time and I loved the ending. I don't want to spoil it but it is very satisfying. Every scene served a purpose and every big story turn made compete sense. I will be going back to see this film again, probably twice. Best film of the summer. Especially for a pixar film. It really moved me and in the end satisfied me.",Brave
379,erejones,"Breathtaking visuals, slightly disappointing 3D",9,16 August 2012,"This film has reinvented Pixar for any number of reasons; not least of which that it is set in 10th century- Scotland. It was, indeed rather remarkable that Pixar chose this storyline above other, less controversial screenplays. Perhaps it had something to prove; this is, after all the first film with a female protagonist and (sort of) director.As a Welshman, I have grown up with tales and legends of concepts like this one, as have other Celtic countries (I.E. Ireland and Scotland) but considering that the film was of American origin they (Pixar) had made a great effort to source a Scottish and otherwise British voice cast, and to learn of the traditional culture of Scotland, and a 10th century UK.The music of Brave was beautiful, really well composed and performed. It made use of Celtic and Scottish instruments (fiddle, Celtic harps, flutes and bodhrán etc.) with a hint Of contemporaryness which I can't quite put my finger on. Patrick Doyle has done a great job (Touch The Sky is already on my I- Pod!)Perhaps the best part of the movie were the visuals. Simply breathtaking (especially in 3D!) the highlands and forest of Scotland were, in their own way, the true star of the movie, and The Animators should be proud. The only let- down on this front were the darker scenes, which look even darker through 3-D glasses, for one scene at the end especially. This is a must-see that takes on a far more mature tone than other films in this genre, and while the younger children came out of theatre sleeping, everyone around us was gripped by the film. Forget talking cars, films like these are the future of Pixar, it left me wanting a sequel! (But really? My mother's a bear?)",Brave

Its an amazing movie if you want to show a movie to your kids. Something a family can lay back and enjoy. The animation is quite good. What impresses is the strong character of Merida and Elinor. The mother-daughter bonding is spectacular. And no matter what others say, the story line is quite different. You won't regret watching this movie. In quite a few occasions the animation is very realistic, never seen so much precision. If you are wondering whether to watch this movie, don't hesitate. Go ahead, its worth watching.",Brave

The story could have been more creative and the title should shave uncovered some more of it(bravery).But don't mind that.Check it out.It's riveting.Kelly Macdonald has really done a great job and the bear stuff is quite hilarious.Not only good for little kids but it will impress the youths too..Mark Andrews and Brenda Chapman have did it.Keep it up!!",Brave
382,drivingjack,Pixar Back After Jumping The Shark,8,6 May 2021,"""Brave"" came out as the next release after the abomination called ""Cars 2"". I thought Pixar was finally out of ideas. Then they came up with an idea that let the girl be the hero (remember this was before ""Frozen""). It was nice to see a girl who was not pure princess, snarky, and beautiful. But her looks do not factor into her character. Merida is her father's daughter: adoringly and awesomely played by Billy Connolly. His King Fergus is manly, macho, and mush in Merida's hands! But while many female characters are hateful towards their parents they have Merida as rebellious but not a woke jerk. I saw it at the theatre when it came out, and just watched it again for the first time since. I will continue to do so. This one is a keeper.",Brave
383,bakingbread,Beautiful film,10,16 March 2014,"Just a quick review to counter a lot of the miserable sods I see writing here.It's a simple and beautiful film about mother and daughter learning to communicate and express their love. And it's as great as any other Pixar or Disney film in that respect.It has good characters. It is chock full of the usual mix of slapstick and cheeky humour.The message is a good one. You can break with tradition. In fact doing so is often necessary to escape the errors of the past. And there are two perspectives to each family battle. Understanding the motives of the other is key to effective communication.Recommended for all who enjoy great Disney stories, full of fun and vivacity and a solid moral core :)",Brave
384,ryanhartford86,Beautiful looking film that doesn't match the quality of story,3,27 June 2012,"This film is very beautifully done, the artists, great job. The storyline was terrible. It was another balled up Disney movie that seemed like it was just trying to fit in every single cliché and Disney trademark as it could. It starts as it should, epic. Then out of nowhere the epic Celtic music begins and the female vocals come in. I immediately wanted to leave. The girl I was with, also seemed exhausted with this as well. It didn't need that, it made the film go from really cool to chick flick.Little did I know, it was going to get worst. The trailer explained the movie as a hero rising, and the changing of fate. Who doesn't like that. So she rides off mad at her mom, finds a witch and requests her fate to be changed. She is granted her wish and her mom is turned into a bear. Yes, a bear. So the entire movie, basically is the main girl trying to mend her moms relationship and turn her back into a human. Well, that's not hard, because the love is already there. She basically apologizes and is sad about everything. and obviously, in the nick of time, the sun, which could consequently keep her a bear, shines light on the two and magically she turns back into a human (which isn't as cool as I'm making it seem). The plot was a total deviation from the trailer, it made no sense, and it was more for little kids than the usual Pixar film, which for the most part is usually made for a wide audience.After the film, I couldn't leave fast enough. I hope people enjoy the film, I just didn't. Nor would I recommend seeing it. I was throughly disappointed, but I'm curious on what others think. So feel free to email me at ryanhartford86@yahoo.com",Brave
385,Readnought,A teenagers mythical brush with fate,8,3 November 2013,"This is a tale of the difficult concept of fate.Merida, the princess of a clan in mythic Scottish coast-lands (supposedly around 400 AD as there's talk of both Romans and vikings being repelled by the clans cooperating) is coming of age. To her loving mother, the queen, in particular, this means she ought to take a suitor, and in general follow the path set before her as first lady of her people. At the time in question, this entails very ladylike and tame conformity indeed. Of symbolic importance is a tapestry of the mothers make and design, hinting at the many threads in the weave of fate/proposed identity. The tapestry shows merida and her mother, among others. It's the mothers design, as is the mothers ideas of how Merida needs to behave. But Merida has her own ideas of what she needs. These get her into trouble so dire that she has to acknowledge the problem of her responses to her mothers proposals as a problem to her as well, perhaps for the first time, and the movie revolves around her making the mental transition from headstrong child to struggling adult.Brave is commonly acknowledged as state of the art of present day animation, and it is certainly a pleasure to look at the realistic yet stunningly beautiful way the wild environment has been put to life. I've rewatched the movie several times, just for that. (have it on blueray)Some have scolded the movie for being thematically difficult to follow, or for not being funny enough. While I can understand the criticism, I think it mostly stems from trouble relating to the difficult theme: that of struggling with a supposedly set fate.The concept of proposed fate/identity is commonly misunderstood as a deterministic outlook, these days, but has more to do with the idea of some lifestories/paths being fitting for a person, and the supposed folly of rebelling against it.So what to do about it - this proposed 'fate' / identity Do as you're told? Do as you please? Fight anyone who would try to oppose you? Try to do right? And what is that, exactly?Brave is about all of that, or just that: The concept of fate, and what to do about it.The title 'Brave' is arguably a poor one, except that it is the one strain of unflinching priority that goes through all Meridas developing approaches to the question of fate/identity. She never shies away from the challenges she's facing, but to begin with, the challenges she accepts as right for her are quite different from the ones society would have her take. (Be a wife, queen, mother etc. as opposed to the challenges of defending her freedom.) To begin with, she's very self-absorbed, if still good natured in a childish fashion. As the story progresses, it becomes apparent to her that this is not good enough, even by the standards of following her own heart, which she manages to do, while it matures.Personally, I applaud Pixar for a huge animation achievement, as well as a tale full of heart and humour, both subtle and overt, taking on a concept as difficult as the struggle for identity, in a manner so smooth and full of magic and adventure that even an early teen child might follow and enjoy it.8 out of 10",Brave
386,connod,Really enjoyed this movie!,8,22 June 2012,"I really do not understand some of the extreme negative reviews for this movie. It's NOT Finding Nemo, and I do get the concept that it's more like Disney than Pixar, but I still really enjoyed seeing it!I loved the mother/daughter theme the most. I grew up with a very controlling mother who had an agenda for my life, so I totally related to Merida's frustration, drives and strong feelings. I cried when they had their blow-out fight and I cried again at the end to see the resolution. I found the mom hilarious after the spell when she keeps trying to be all proper and modest, even though it's impossible for her character to do that.I like that Pixar created a female lead who has strength, but also compassion and remorse for her wrong choices. I really enjoyed Merida's speech to the clans and appreciated her character development to see beyond herself. I thought her growth was a good model for teenage girls who may resent their parents at times, but learn to reconcile and love them in the end. It was very touching when Merida realizes that her mother was right about a lot of things. It's more common in real life to come full circle and learn, than it is to just obey and do everything right all along. Even in real life, I don't think there has ever been a hero that did not go through tragic circumstances of some form. Courage does not grow from a soft life.I enjoyed the humor of the triplet brothers and the clan leaders/sons. I'm part Scottish, so I'm also glad to see a movie that shows the beauty of Scotland. The animation of the highlands and surrounding areas was breathtaking. The soundtrack was awesome. I love Celtic music and it was a treat to hear the penny whistles and bagpipes. The audience applauded at the end and it was great to be in a crowd that enjoyed it, tooLastly, stay for the bonus scene after the credits! Most people left the theater. It's not spectacular, but just good fun! I would have preferred to see Merida on a goofy 1st date or something like that more...BUT I still enjoyed it!",Brave
387,IlustreBOB,Brave in a nutshell (or why Brave is a sexist movie),4,22 July 2012,"Brave is an animated movie about a rebel princess that turns her sexist mother into a bear, then she regrets her decision and decides that being a rebel is being selfish and ends up being sexist herself.The end.Since the main theme of the movie is destiny and oppression against women, I expected some sort of intelligent message to be delivered by the end of the movie. Some sort of libertarian point of view. To my utter disappointment, Pixar end up with a conformist message delivered by the hands of a woman (Brenda Chapman). Despite its visual qualities, that makes Brave the worst Pixar movie ever.",Brave
388,VelvetOctopusProductions,The most conventional animated film ever made. Might as well be called 'Mother Bear',5,16 June 2012,"Brave was possibly my most anticipated film of the year, not because I thought it would be good, but I knew that watching it would be history in the making. This was Pixar's chance for them to redeem what they did with last years 'Cars 2', a very mediocre animated film. Have Pixar done that? In short, No.Brave is possibly the most conventional animated film ever made. The Plot is the same one seen in 'The Little Mermaid', 'Happy Feet', 'Kung Fu Panda', Parodied in 'Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs' and most similar 'How to Train Your Dragon', about parents who don't let their kids be what they want to be, and have to learn how they have been wrong in this regard. There is also similarities to 'Brother Bear', which are quite obvious.Brave's positives come from it's grand visual style, typically pixar, and the fact that it takes itself seriously and has a structured narrative and characters. This gives it the 6 points by itself, but the 4 are lost through a variety of things.The comic relief seems tact on and incredibly unfunny. The way the story tries to get the plot moving is silly. The conflict is way too co-incidental and forced. There's also a subplot about the tribes of the land and how bad it is that they are fighting, which really doesn't make sense when you see that they seem like they are just having fun.The greatest disappointment is the fact that the magic this movie promises is weak, and it feels like we've seen it all before.",Brave
389,perpetuallybadhaircut,A Revelation in Female Heroism as well as Family Values,8,16 July 2012,"At first glance, some may think of ""Brave"" as a step-down from Pixar's usual revelation, but after much consideration, I figured there really wasn't any fault with ""Brave"" itself. Some think ""Brave""'s weakness comes from the risky choice of using the fiery-haired Scottish, female protagonist (a first for Pixar), but the real throwback comes from Pixar's choice to take their story from a fairy tale take on things. Most of the other Pixar films featured original stories, ones that were only vaguely familiar. Throughout ""Brave"" I couldn't help but let my mind wander as the film progressed. Each conflict somehow reminded me of other fairy tales (""Beauty & the Beast"", ""Pinnochio"", etc. ), but that's exactly how fairy tales work. Lessons to be learned are hard to come up with, and the classic recycling of tales works in harmony with this still original story. The authentic accents of Kelly Macdonald as the scarlet-haired archer known as Princess Merida, and Emma Thompson as the caring yet sometimes ""Carrie""-esque mother, Queen Elinor create an atmosphere of ancient and mystifying Scottish countryside (animated beautifully with lush greens and bright blues). The problem isn't in the voice acting. Animation is a perfectionist practice, they carefully plan and make sure the voices are perfect enough to work the animation around. The problem is in the writing. Something like this dialogue, filled with light (and sometimes crude) humor is often over-played (especially in the beginning), but it's sure to keep kids entertained. But that kind of logic (wanting to appeal more to a certain audience, rather than everyone) is what I would've expected from DreamWorks. When the movie needs to be dramatic or serious, it achieves it with grace and controlled emotion, but it sort of jumps right into it, without much tension building. It's more of an explosion and the movie plays out from there. The problem with fairy tales is; they're always predictable. You can't escape the clichés forever though, and I still applaud the filmmakers for handling their first female protagonist with an elegance and intrigue without having to make a big deal about romance or tradition. The mystifying Scottish culture that surrounds the film's atmosphere is eye- catching. The cheesiness of that family-time goodness seeps in blissfully, even for those who find the humor to be draining at times. ""Brave"" isn't the strongest Pixar film, but it's not a failure.",Brave
390,dillett-2007,"A Brave yet disappointing effort, and I'm half Scottish.",5,18 August 2012,"I'm certainly not the first and will not the last person to claim how much respect and love I have for Pixar. But I do. The earliest memory I have in cinema was watching my Mum marvel at the amazing CGI in 'Toy Story'. I was too young at the time to appreciate the remarkable mastery of Pixar's animation. But over the years and later films like the next two installments of 'Toy Story', 'Monsters Inc.', 'UP'...for me, growing up with Pixar's visual effects and quality story telling left and undoubted source of film inspiration. So I cannot be blamed for going to see 'Brave' with anything but high hopes, unfortunately Brave didn't quite meet them. One immediate comparison that draws to mind on what to expect is Dreamworks' 'How to train your Dragon', the Celtic imagery and story based on a young individual trying to find their calling and prove themselves. However, this is not a comparison that is necessarily a good one as I didn't care much for 'How to train your Dragon'. One thing that was certainly missing from Brave that is 'so-so' important in all of Dreamworks and Pixar films is the great friendships. Mike and Sulley, Woody and Buzz, Ginger and Rocky, Shrek and Donkey, Marlin and Dory, Wall-e and Eve... these great friendships are the reason why we love these characters. When we see them meet, when they fight, mock each other, make up and sometimes say goodbye. Throughout 'Brave' I was dying for another 'great character' someone who will allow us to get to know Merida (protagonist) and shake her to the core, changing her permanently. I flatly cannot remember another characters name and I feel that nothing was learn't, nobody truly discovered something profound or worth the whopping budget of a Pixar feature film. Maybe I'm being harsh - their are some real highlights. The witty one- liners, clever observations, slap-stick comedy and real 'tongue-in- cheek' moments. Billy Connolly, is as always, a real pro. His pounding 'Glasgow brood' makes a welcome addition to the seemingly unending whining and whinging on behalf of Merida and her nagging Mother. The animation itself is remarkable. Some of the shots of Merida riding horseback through the highland countryside are breathtaking, her hair itself, with layers and layers of texture is almost a character in itself. But when it comes to animation 'making' a film what it is, I'm afraid the horse has well and truly jumped the gate. I think a time before 'UP'and 'Toy Story 3' existed that would have been enough. But 'Brave' as it is, is bravely walking with giants and needs to compare: both visually and narratively. I'm left deflated by 'Brave' - as I'm writing this I'm realizing this more and more. I'm recalling the chills I still have when I saw that immortal ending to 'Toy Story' and the visceral battles in 'The Incredibles'. All that is left is to wonder, who is this for? Is the comedy, story- telling and references enough for adults, perhaps not. Is the story magical enough for children - possibly. But on all accounts, for me, I'd rather delve into the old Pixar DVD collection.",Brave
391,Joemalone-249-244242,Pixar undergoes Identity Crisis,3,19 August 2012,"Four out of ten may seem like a harsh score for what is actually a decent film but on leaving the cinema this morning the overwhelming feeling was one of being cheated. I paid to see a Pixar film and what I actually got was the traditional Disney fairy tale princess theme and story. If you want that then watch Tangled which is in my opinion a better film. My 3 year old son is a huge Pixar fan, as am I, and he has every Pixar film and watches them repeatedly. This film didn't hold his attention and in fact he wanted to go home after 15 minutes in the cinema. It is not a film you'd watch repeatedly and if I can nail the problem it is simply that the animation is too realistic and the storyline maybe a little too sophisticated if that's possible. Ultimately it failed in its humour and failed to cut through those cross generational barriers and entertain all ages. I'm sure there will be many reviews stating how stunning the visuals are and they were; almost too stunning in places because here's the trap that Pixar/Disney risk falling into... An animated film can be too real; kids want to see an animated film and not something with stunning scenery. It feels like Disney arrested control of this movie and I may be wrong but I suspect we'd be looking at an actual Pixar film had Steve Jobs still been around to deal with quality control. So we have something of a trade description issue here, if this was a Disney film I'd have given it 7/10 but it isn't, it's a Pixar film and they have a history of being rather more innovative, creative and original than this.",Brave
392,brenweh,"Scary for kids, but refreshingly feisty for a Disney Princess movie.",8,2 December 2012,"I've gotta say, it's hard to find negatives about ""Brave"". The animation is breathtakingly lifelike - it's easy to forget you're watching an animated movie. And the scenery is a beautiful, if not accurate, representation of Scotland. And it's nice to see a princess movie that's about the princess, not her romantic prospects. Finally, he cast is incredibly talented, and all the Scottish brogues can be enchanting at times. Considering that voice actors record their parts separately, the interaction between Thompson and Macdonald is almost too good to be true. The mother-daughter relationship is believable and sometimes even comic - like when Bear-Elinor fusses at Merida to get her makeshift weapon off the table.The problem is, ""Brave"" isn't original or sophisticated enough to join the Pixar hall of fame. The story is simple and sweet, but unlike Pixar classics like ""Toy Story"", ""Finding Nemo"", and ""WALL-E"", if you look hard enough, there's a similar movie out there. He most obvious example is Merida: while she may be a strong female character, she falls into the trap of being yet another frustrated, self-absorbed teenager. The artistry is incredible. Merida is probably the most admirable Disney princess yet. But it's a little disappointing for a Pixar movie. It's still a great family movie - just don't expect it to hold up to Pixar standards.",Brave
393,sophie_summerfield,Awe-inspiring Animation,7,19 December 2012,"Brave 2012Pixar's Brave delivers everything you could expect from a family friendly animated film and more. Uncomplicated humour and a relaxing watch; the most uncomplicated of humour being exemplified by scot's flashing their bottoms, a feminine crown-wearing bear and a set of mischievous red headed triplets.Merida provides a princess which has not often been seen amongst the likes of Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty and Pocahontas. In Brave the audience is treated to a young girl who refutes gender stereotypes, enforced by her mother, and competes for her ""own hand"" which, in this case, means her independence. Such takes place in an archery competition in which she beats her suitors in a Robin Hood-esque fashion, making her more of the hero as opposed to the Maid Marion damsel in distress.However, when looking more analytically into the film, as Brave's protagonist refutes these stereotypes and clearly identifies best with her father, King Fergus - the audience are given a visual means of such identification via their bright orange, very Scottish, hair - it begins to create a character that is seemingly in the midst's of an Electra complex which she must overcome (identify with her mother) in order to succeed.Still, conversely, aside from the slightly perhaps worrisome psychosexual references, this film is light hearted fun and thoroughly enjoyable nevertheless. It provides entertainment not only for young audiences but for adults as well. The crow-abusing witch character being particularly amusing, as a woman who makes whimsical wooden carvings, mostly of bears, and also trivialises magic and witch craft. She details how she performed a spell for a prince as well as providing him with an ""especially attractive mahogany cheese board.""The impeccable CGI only adds to the many merits that Brave deserves, an example of such being Merida's hair which is captivating in detail. Her hair, in which the audience is treated to gaze upon almost every curl, each one individually crafted, is as visually stunning as it is important in regards to representing her rebellious character and heritage.It is this type of awe striking CGI that was first seen in Pixar's Monsters Inc. in which technology was introduced that allowed each hair on character Sully's body to move individually. Yet, it is not only the hair which aid in the capture of the imagination, but the way in which the clothes move with the character's bodies the audience could be forgiven for overlooking its brilliance as, in its perfection, it becomes unnoticeable in the way you wouldn't notice synchronisation between clothes and an actor's movements in an unanimated film. In order to make such beautiful computer animation, Pixar rewrote their animation systems for the first time in 25 years and, without a shadow of a doubt, it has paid off.",Brave

The animation and rendering are truly amazing works and the scenic vistas of Scotland have been beautifully portrayed.The reason that Brave has become so successful is simply because its characters and storyline are very relatable. The character of Merida is essentially that of every modern teenager both boys and girls, who wish to be free and follow their own paths. On the other hand the queen portrays the parents who wish what is best for their children and yet can be overbearing and restrictive.

396,settineri-john,"Interesting movie, but terrible storyline.",4,27 April 2014,"To be honest, Brave does everything (almost) right. Good atmosphere, tense animation, and decent world-building in medieval Scotland. To this credit, it's actually miles ahead of that other pile of (insert expletive) Frozen, who once mentions its Norwegian setting, and seems to neglect all possibilities of world-building for its shallow nature. However, the story is not without flaw, as there is one giant gaping hole--there are no bears in medieval Scotland. I've been to Scotland, beautiful country and all, but there are no bears there. None. Did the creators even think that through? This whole part, when the mother turns into a bear, kills all semblance of the plot. You sit there going ""what the hell?"" for the remainder of the movie. And in the beginning, Merida is terribly annoying. Selfish, rebellious from custom, she's almost as unbearable as Belle (more? What the hell does ""more"" mean?). At least her parents are there to struggle with her complaining, and try to inform her that she's being an idiot (which surprisingly takes her the whole movie to figure out). However, at least she learns her lesson and grows over the course of the movie (at least I think she does, the ending is unclear). That's at least one of the few good things about it. Another is the setting. Really nice setting they have there, with the characters speaking in Scottish accents and performing Scottish custom. If the movie stayed on that track and evaded the continual Merida complaining, we'd have a more decent movie. Overall it's a 4/10. Not great by any means, but it's enjoyable enough.",Brave

400,ccgibs3196,Another Pixar Masterpiece,10,24 June 2012,"First off, I should say that I've been waiting to see Brave for over a year. The entire feminist community, for the most part, has been waiting. This is probably the main reason Merida's story doesn't have the same feel as Cars, Up, The Incredibles, etc. It was written to fill a hole in children's movies. Specifically, a hole for young girls.Brave is not only spectacularly animated with beautiful landscapes and rich colors, but it is a story that is entrenched in Scottish history and culture that gives it yet another level of beauty. Telling the story of the Princess Merida, this is considered another movie in the Disney Princess juggernaut, but I think it stands on its own. This is not a story about young romance or about a tomboy who likes to shoot arrows, it is a story about young adolescence. Believing your mother wants something different from you than you want for yourself. The relationship between Merida and her mother is well developed and compelling for just about any teenager that butted heads with their own mother. I think this movie can speak to all ages of boys and girls, and this is what separates Brave from other Disney Princesses that are inherently removed from young boys. I challenge you to find another Pixar or Disney movie that is centered on the relationship between a daughter and a mother. What more, it's a story about self-discovery. Merida learns that being a princess has true responsibilities. She does not rebel against being one, merely being the one her mother wants her to be. She never yearns to be a prince or have the freedom of a boy--she just wants to be accepted as the young girl she is. I think that is an important story to be told. I was worried this movie would let me down, but I left the movie in tears. This is Pixar at its finest.",Brave
401,imawhackjob12,Doesn't live up to the Princess standard,5,19 January 2014,"When we think of Disney Princess movies, we expect them to be perfect in every way with story, plot, characters and the most important of all, the songs. If you watched any other Disney Princess movie, you would probably get sucked in and kinda feel like a kid again. This movie does NOT do that. When I first saw the commercial for this, I thought "" Wow this is gonna be epic with a tough Mulan-ish princess battling a curse!"" so my expectations were naturally high. This movie is not at ALL what i expected from the preview. Instead of fighting and ""ancient curse"" it's just about a rough and tough princess who accidentally turned her pushy mom into a bear. That's pretty much it. You don't get sucked into the storyline at all. How this beat Wreck-It- Ralph for an award is beyond me.",Brave
402,paulinakonopka,Disney does what they do best.,10,22 June 2012,"If any film makes me cry that means it hit the spot and that has a lot of meaning to it. I cried because it made me automatically think of my own mother and daughter relationship that has good days and bad days and we argue and then we don't speak to one another and then we hug it out, cry it out and make up. It's one thing to have a mother that loves you so darn much that she wants all and the very best for you, but that in itself has it's difficulties in getting across and it gets to a point where neither listen to one another, and it's another thing to sometimes not realise it. With all that said though the film made me laugh the same way it made me cry because it's really funny, witty, sometimes scary, beautifully animated and it's just everything that Disney flawlessly execute every time. I loved it and will certainly add it to my collection.Everything is like marmite, you'll either love it or hate it, but watch it for your own curiosity.",Brave
403,jc_fleischman,Charming but not all it could be,6,21 November 2012,"To start this review I'm going to say watch ""Tangled"" if you haven't already done so. That's what this film should have been.I am a little biased as I lived in Scotland for a number of years and still can't understand how the Scots can embrace historically inaccurate ""Braveheart"" with the Scottish hero played by an Americanised Australian. That being said I'm sure that they'll embrace ""Brave"". This film hits nearly every Scottish stereotype... well the ones that are reasonably family friendly. The film does have a good dose of Scottish voice talent, even if many of them haven't been home in a while.I'm happy to see The Big Yin (Billy Connolly) as part of the cast, but bitterly disappointed that they seem to have failed to adapt the character to Billy at all. The result being a somewhat lacklustre character that misses the mark.The female heroine is a firm cliché now but this is still a heart warming film. Unfortunately the two really funny characters (the Raven and the Witch's Broom) have very short scenes. The triplets are also devilishly amusing but again don't have enough screen time. The soundtrack is very typical airy/new age/folk music and is very well performed, but to me it sounds more Irish than Scottish. I think the soundtrack could definitely have used some more modern punch to it (Britney or Christina style). And the soundtrack seems contradictory to the film's main themes of being a ground breaking heroine and teenage rebellion. I watched the trailers in 3D but missed seeing the film in 3D. The 3D looked good, but I don't think that they made much effort to do a proper 2D version. It would appear that they've simply taken one field of the 3D rather than re-rendering it for 2D.Overall it's good family fun, but I don't see anyone compulsively rewatching this film.",Brave
404,filmforcefive,Pixar is Dead - Narcissism is Alive and Well,3,29 November 2012,"Time was, the word ""Pixar"" virtually guaranteed high quality animation and superb storytelling, certain to entertain the entire family. Now, it seems, ""Pixar"" is just a high profile moniker slapped onto corporately written Disney cartoons. Some would argue that 2006's ""Cars"", a vehicular retelling of the oh-so-classic story ""Doc Hollywood"", began this downhill slide. However, I believe the real dumbing-down of Pixar was ushered in by 2009's scatterbrained ""Up"". After all, Dodo birds and talking dogs who fly airplanes do seem a step or two down in intellect from anything in ""WALL-E"" or ""Ratatouille"". This trend toward the lucrative 'toddler' demographic continued with 2010's forgettable ""Toy Story 3"" and hit its low (or so I thought) with 2011's nearly unwatchable spy parody, ""Cars 2"" (unwatchable for anyone old enough to have seen an actual spy movie, that is). Granted, these are all just technically advanced cartoons, but Pixar has a well documented history of attempting to be something... better than that.Now, we have ""Brave"". The trailers were impressive. The story seemed to hint at substance. Surely, the past few Pixar forays into cinematic mediocrity had to have been flukes, right? Wrong. ""Brave"" may just be the worst of the lot.The movie begins in a familiar storybook vein, with the ideas that a person should be free to determine the path his or her own life takes and that the traditional ways may not always be the best ways. Disney films have visited these themes time and again - 1998's ""Mulan"" comes immediately to mind. ""Brave"" moves the story from China to Scotland, but soon strays into morally unfocused concepts that deal with things best left to the four screenwriter's therapists to resolve. Unlike ""Up"", which innocently traded sincerity for silliness, ""Toy Story 3"", which was unnecessary to anyone but a Disney accountant, or ""Cars 2"", which was simply infantile, ""Brave"" defiantly sends a series of truly disturbing messages to children: 'It's okay to disrespect your parents.' 'Be as selfish as you wish.' 'Apologize only when it benefits you personally.' 'To get what you want, the ends always justify the means.' So, if these are the kinds of values that you wish to instill in your kids, I recommend ""Brave"" as your next babysitter. However, don't blame me for how messed up those kids may be in ten or fifteen years... that responsibility lies with you!",Brave
405,ghosh-rajarshi41,Honestly... this movie bagged an Oscar!!!!,4,16 April 2013,"A highly predictable, high melodramatic storyline, which you have seen/read in a thousand TV shows/books . Standard quality animation (why should anyone be bothered about the hair?), blackish background which makes the movie thoroughly dull. Pixar has lost its touch and Disney is suffering from a serious lack of innovation. In fact, after watching this movie I am convinced that Disney is now fit to enter the business of Indian or Bengali daily soaps. Predictably, again Disney is obsessed with wronged princesses, funny horses (here not so funny) and evil witches (those poor ladies, who in most of the cases turn out to be the heroin's mother). Thank god there is at least no prince charming in this movie. The girl seems obnoxious, selfish. Moreover, what makes this movie a particular horror show is the way Disney haplessly try to incorporate scenes with underlying sexual meanings. And those series of pink butts is quite disgusting. Overall, I do not believe this movie is ever going to please a sensible person / Scottish person. Utterly forgettable movie. Not funny, not tragic, does not inspire any type of emotion excepts irritation. Perhaps just one time watch. @Pixer/Disney, Why not make a male-oriented movie for a change?",Brave
406,jan1649,"Movie Depicts Girl in Awkward Hair Phase, Gets Pilloried",9,14 November 2012,"The number of negative reviews for this film truly staggered me, but I did find some common themes throughout most of this criticism. It seems that many reviewers felt that the heroine, Merida, was selfish, resented the chores of her position, and whined a lot. Well, HOLD THE PRESSES! Teenagers dislike their parents? Resent the things they are told they must do? Desire to find their own path? And they whine a lot? NEVER!!!! A least not for a girl, it seems. One review even went so far as to call Merida a ""bitch."" This highly offensive language directed at a CARTOON CHARACTER hides some truly twisted hatred toward women.To offer a contrast, I give you: Luke Skywalker. Yep, Luke ""But I wanna go to Tashi station and pick up some power-converters"" Skywalker. I love Luke, but let's face it, he was a whiny, snot-nosed kid until far into ""Empire."" And he had some major Dad issues. But that's OK because films about Father/son issues abound. Apparently Mother/daughter issues aren't to be discussed in film.Personally, I wanted to give my Mom a great ""bear"" (sorry) hug after watching this film. Not only did the visual aspects carry me to a beautiful other-world in the first moments, but I was EXTREMELY pleased with the character of the Mother, Elinor. Emma Thompson's portrayal and the writing made her a REAL MOM. She wasn't evil. She was just being a Mom. And anyone who ever had or has been a teenager can sympathize with Merida's desire to break free from her parents' identities and establish her own.In the end, Merida comes to love and understand her mother for the human-being she is, not the evil ""bear"" of her fantasy. And her mother goes through the same arc as well, nicely completing the circle of a young woman trying to establish her own identity in the shadow of a powerful mother, and her mother learning to appreciate her daughter for her own strengths. This happens to girls as well as men. We all eventually have to make our peace with our parents. This story just happened to focus on the female experience instead of the male. I don't think there would be half the criticism of this movie if the gender-roles were reversed. I, for one, felt elated to finally see this age-old story told without having to translate the genders to fit my experience -- the doting father and the mother who ""just doesn't get me."" I'm terribly sorry if some men were put off by the female characters not conforming to their infantile stereotypes, and that they weren't pandered to in the music, stylization, and depiction of the characters, but tough, fellas. You get EVERY OTHER MOVIE. We girls get ONE that doesn't think we only care about boys and accepts that girls go through awkward hair stages, too. So, like Luke, Merida eventually takes up her grown-up mantle and finds peace with her Mother. What on earth is wrong with that? Oh the music was ""girly?"" Not enough boobs? Watch ""Ironman,"" grow up, and quit your whining!",Brave
407,janisgale,recommended for ages 6+,8,18 June 2012,"I watched this movie in 3D with my (very mature for his age) five year old grandson. He loved it and wanted to talk about the plot for most of the afternoon to anyone who would listen. However, other young children in the theatre were rather nervous and scared in certain parts of the film and a few very small (2 - 4 year old) children had to be escorted out of the cinema by their parents.Personally, after the first five minutes, which were a bit slow, I became absorbed in the story and thoroughly enjoyed the movie. There was lots of action and the plot was attention grabbing and unique, with no soppy love story and little slang included.",Brave
408,lorieauguste,It was OK... Not great... 5 and unders may run screaming,6,23 June 2012,"I will start off with: I have 2 grand sons, ages 4.5 and 6 years old. Both are Autistic.The youngest falls on the floor with guttural laughter in the beginning scenes of Finding Nemo... When Claire is attacked by the barracuda...With that said...I saw BRAVE in a theater PACKED with 4-8 year olds. For parents/adults... the movie was 'cute'... definitely no 'Finding Nemo'. The kids in the theater seemed to really enjoy the movie overall. There are a couple of funny 'bare bottoms' moments that adults and kids alike enjoyed.Towards the end of the movie, there is a 'fight' scene including a couple of 'Bears'... When the scene was over... half of the kids were screaming 'YEAH!!!!' and half were just screaming... crying out-loud because they were so frightened.So, if your child has difficulties with 'scary Disney confrontations', you may want to think twice before taking them... if your kids get it, or don't get the 'loud, scary fight scenes'.. you'll probably be OK... but seriously... the 5 and unders had a pretty hard time with the 'final' battle...This 'final' battle is more 'violent' than the Claire vs Barracuda... and longer... just FYI",Brave

I took my ten year old cousin to see it as well and she LOVED it. Not to mention it was beautifully done, funny and had a great plot and had moral lessons ! I was so happy she was seeing women displayed in such an empowering way. Merida can take care of herself, is strong willed and knows what she wants in life. However, her mother has it planned out for her. She wants her to marry and Merida just doesn't want to. So, Merida goes to a witch to seek help. She gets a spell that will make her mom agree to whatever she says so she doesn't have to marry. However, the spell turns her mom into a bear and Merida has only 24 hours to turn her mom back into normal. Hilarity, drama and action ensue on Merida's quest to turn her mother back into a human !

410,MovieLoverHannah,"Oh, Disney/Pixar, What went wrong?",4,12 July 2012,"Quite honestly, I was very disappointed with this film. Based on the commercials, I was eager to see ""Brave"". Too bad the actual film is nothing like the advertisements lead it on to be.I have a couple problems with this film. First of all, the plot reminded me very much of another Disney film. ""Brother Bear"". Basically, Disney and Pixar put a feminine twist on the film mentioned above. And instead of a brotherly love, a motherly love was shown.My second issue with ""Brave"" is, well, the title. The protagonist, Merida, showed no signs of bravery. In fact, she acted quite childish; sulking and crying when she believes there is no hope of her mother ever becoming human again. If you haven't guessed already, Queen Elinor gets turned into a bear. Anyway.My third issue with the movie is that Merida is considered the protagonist of this film. To me, the protagonist is the person that changes the most throughout the film. But that's just me. Merida doesn't want to do what her mother wants her to do, so what's her logical solution? Go complaining to a witch and turns her mother into a bear. By the end, Queen Elinor changes her view of what Merida should be, yet Merida is still the selfish, immature, dare I say brat that she was at the beginning of the film. Thus, making Queen Elinor the protagonist.My fourth and final issue with this film is the advanced action. If I was a 4-10 year old viewing ""Brave"", then I would be absolutely terrified at some of the scenes. Okay, I'll admit it. I am 13 and still got a little spooked at one part. There is much fighting and many killing attempts in ""Brave"".Although there are many down sides to ""Brave"", and I'm not sure what the message of the film was, (Maybe it's 'if you have any problems, take the easy way out? Or maybe its,""If your parents don't do what you want them to do, just give them potion, or in our society... poison, I guess. Or maybe drugs."") but it provided entertainment and some good quotes. I'm not going to tell you to see it or not see it, that's your choice. But these are my opinions. Yours might be different.",Brave
411,Denheaner,Something happened....Disney happened.,1,20 July 2012,"First of all, i wanna state that i didn't see the film, and i don't need to, because its clear that its not going to change my opinion regardless.The year is 2011, my family and i was watching TV, and all of a sudden, the very first Brave trailer showed up, i looked at it and thought to myself, ""wow, this Pixar's stab at fantasy and epic storytelling sure is going to be their next masterpiece next to Toy Story 3, it looks like Disney is not gonna screw this up like they did with Cars 1 and 2."" and my brothers were excited for it.And then, we fast-forward to 2012, the new theatrical trailer for Brave showed up, the movie was released, and my brothers and i watched the new trailer, and then...meh.It looked like they said ""f&ck it, this ain't no epic, it's just your regular dumb Disney flick like Tangled"" i sighted, and taught to myself, Disney did it again.i bet they were going for a more mature theme for this like they did with Toy Story 3, but Disney said "" no! Sorry, this type of movie wont sell, rewrite the script and add comic- reliefs, gags and the magic element to play a big part in the film""I don't know about you Disney fans, Pixar fans, and fans of this type of genre alike, and when i mean genre, i mean comedy/musical, animation is not a genre, Brave is considered by me and a lot of people, Pixar's newest fail, it could've been a masterpiece, but it looks like this type of genre doesn't make enough money.I am going to watch it now, to confirm, if i am wrong.",Brave
412,work-430-813803,"okay for a Disney movie, poor for a Pixar",4,23 July 2012,"Pixar execs used to say that the story was indispensable in their filmmaking. They were right. It is too bad they didn't follow their own advice in making Brave. As a formulaic Disney movie, it would be average (though with above average visuals). But our family (kids' ages from 10 to 18) doesn't bother seeing formulaic Disney movies anymore. We saw it yesterday, and everyone was disappointed. ""Cliche,"" one of our children said. ""Easily the worst Pixar movie I've ever seen,"" said another (though none of us has seen Cars 2). I chuckled once.Even though the moral of the story is that we're free to change our fate, the stock Disney characters were firmly locked into their roles and we could see the ending coming less than halfway through. I'm sorry I saw it at all.In a wonderful documentary called ""The Pixar Story,"" John Lasseter tells the story of how Disney suits almost ruined ""Toy Story,"" which had to be remade radically in order to be saved. It feels like this time the Disney suits succeeded.Is this a sign of things to come? Has Pixar been domesticated?

413,erik-crvts,Awuful,1,27 November 2014,"This movie plot has nothing to do with the title; this spoiled, ugly, selfish girl does nothing but elude consequences, being stubborn, and not for a second accept the authority of her mother. She just want to do as she please, throwing the guilt against the witch for her mother condition, putting her in risk, shoot and point arrows against her father, chopping his leg, all while she almost provoked a war three against the one kingdom than never showed an army: his father's. If this is the role model for girls and yo actually like it, you have absolutely no right to be surprised about what Femen does, or the bully Dr. Matt Tyler was subjected by feminist groups, this nonsensical genre anarchism is caused for the acceptance of the meaning people think this movie has.

414,lhh90403,Brave has little Heart,5,25 June 2012,"I knew Brave was in trouble from the first few words spoken in voice over as the film began. Merida (Kelly Macdonald) uses the words ""fate"" and ""destiny"" interchangeably. This muddle is at the heart of the film's problem.What's the difference between fate and destiny? Philosophers through the ages have distinguished the two based on choice. Fate is something that happens TO you. Destiny is something that happens BECAUSE of you.Fate is at the root of such words as ""fatal"" and ""fatalistic."" It implies LACK of choice. Philosopher Rollo May says fate is what we are born into, something that cannot be changed and that we have no control over, such as race.May says destiny is what we create based on what we were given. Destiny is all about CHOICE. It's what we choose to do with what we have.Merida is born a princess. She can't change that. Her mother, Queen Elinor (Emma Thompson), is grooming Merida for a role as future queen. After a long series of wars King Fergus (Billy Connolly) has united the four clans. Merida's duty is to help keep the clans unified though a judicious marriage.Merida is a wild rebellious child with special talent as a rider and archer. The demonstrations of her skills are absolutely breathtaking. She is unique and extraordinary and initially looks very much like a Power of Idealism character.These kinds of characters are driven by their passion. They abhor what they consider to be a mundane, boring, or mediocre life. They want to seize some grand destiny that is uniquely theirs.Well-drawn female protagonists in this vein are: Paikea (Keisha Castle-Hughes) in Whale Rider and Jess Kaur Bhamra (Parminder Nagra) in Bend it Like Beckham. Unlike Paikea or Jess, Merida doesn't fight for what she believes is HER destiny. Merida, instead, decides to change her mother! Perhaps this is because Merida has no clue about what she is really called to do.Now the story gets even muddier. With the help of an old witch's spell Merida does indeed change her mother — into a bear.Instead of figuring out who she is and what she uniquely is called to do, Merida must again deal with who her mother is. In the struggle over the middle part of Brave, Queen Elinor becomes the protagonist.The definition of a protagonist, in my book, is the person who makes the biggest emotional sacrifice in the story. It is the person who undergoes the most profound transformation. This is clearly Elinor on every front.Queen Elinor is a Power of Conscience character. She is a strict and demanding taskmaster, a perfectionist, and is driven by a strong sense of tradition and duty. Over the course of the story she recognizes her daughter's uniqueness and fully appreciates Merida for who she is.The first important glimpse of Elinor's change of heart is the brawl in the great hall after Merida has disappeared. When Merida strides back into the hall it is Elinor who puts words in Merida's mouth. Elinor speaks through her surrogate about going against tradition and marrying for love. It is Elinor who makes an eloquent plea for choice and following one's heart. Merida is just her passive interpreter. At the end of the film Elinor is willing to sacrifice her own life in a battle with the ancient cursed bear, who one would assume, was the monster who took off her husband's leg. Or not? Who knows?Even more confusingly this monster turns out to be the legendary brother, it would seem, who destroyed the ancient kingdom so long ago because of his pride and selfishness. How how did he turn into a bear? Was it mother love or something else that breaks his curse?When a legend and curse is set up so carefully it should have a pay-off having to do with Merida or her destiny– if the film is really about Merida.And what does Merida do that is so brave? She scurries around looking for the witch's house after her mother turns into a bear. She stitches up (with big clumsy childish stitches) the tapestry she slashed separating her from her mother. She does a lot of running away and running around. She is ineffective in battling the monstrous cursed bear. And she collapses in tears remembering her mother's loving kindness as the second sunrise threatens to make her mother's bear curse permanent. In other words, she acts like a child– or worse a girl.At the end of the film, Elinor has changed but not Merida. Merida is the same galloping wild child as she was in the beginning. It is a sinking back into carefree childhood rather than striding toward an adulthood based both on duty and and an individualistic sense of self. If you are a young woman, what is the lesson here?Brave offers no alternative vision of how Merida might help unify the clan in some way that is uniquely hers. It provides a very unsatisfying resolution. How has Merida changed or grown? What happens when King Fergus and Queen Elinor are too old to rule? What is Merida's role going forward? What exactly is her destiny?For the full review go to my website ETBscreenwriting.",Brave
415,bjesso,"Beautifully animated, not so beautifully thought out.",6,12 November 2012,"The visual stimulation is wonderful and very well thought out, however much of the film fell far to short. Also, why is the movie called ""Brave""? The title does not fit the movie in any sense at all.Voice acting was very well done, and seemed to fit the movie perfectly. The characters were, for the most part, enjoyable. However, the lack of common sense in the movie was far to much for my liking.I understand parents don't always listen to their children, as well as the opposite, however the sheer stupidity of the parents in this movie was almost to much handle. No one likes a predictable movie, but when the movie makes you want to smash your face in due to sheer ""dead horse kicking"" stupidity, it's a little to much. Children will like the movie, but anyone that has hit puberty will find the movie repetitive to the point of constantly rolling their eyes.The story is extremely vague. Girl wants to defy parents, girl runs off with absolutely no goal or ideas. There is no direction in this. Just getting even with your mother and then crying when you make a boo-boo.The bear thing was overdone and redundant a lot of the time. Seriously, how does this have anything to do with the word ""Brave"", the movies title? I was looking very forward to this movie but it fell far short of my expectations. This one is worth a rental, but in no way is it worth the full purchase price. Wait until it goes in the 5 dollar bin at Wal-mart. Oh wait...it's Disney, that means it will forever be 30 dollars because they milk the customer for everything they have. Just rent it.",Brave
416,TamzinSniper,Another Bratty Ginger Princess..,1,13 May 2013,"The first time I saw the trailer for Brave I thought OH WOW THIS ACTUALLY LOOKS GOOD! The whole plot of a princess who doesn't want to get married seemed really cool. Merida, The fresh new warrior princess defying tradition.. I guess I over hyped it for myself.The beginning looked great! Everything looked so real I thought I was watching live action. The music is very beautiful and melodic. The movies female protagonist is princess Merida. A flame haired tomboy who is a skilled archer and loves riding her horse Angus. She spends most of her time at home fussing with her mother the queen Elinors strict commands on how to be a proper princess. I didn't have a problem with this, Elinor is just trying to be a good mother and teach her daughter how to do things the right way for her own good and wellbeing. Of course Merida isn't OK with these rules of being a princess. So Merida and Elinor spend most of there time arguing with each other. But this isn't the case through Meridas eyes. Elinor informs her that she is to be betrothed to one of her father's allied clans sons. Merida doesn't like this idea of getting married to anybody and at her young age. So she throws the biggest fits from here on out. (Through out the rest of the whole film.) If I was going to be put through arranged marriage at my age, I would have a fit too. But Merida is a princess of the 10th century Scotland world. Her marriage is only for the sake of peace for her country. She could still shoot her arrows after shes married.. or maybe not. Things get even more sour when Merida yells off at her mom screaming '' I would rather die then be like you!'' and runs away for an hour. Everything is easily fixed with magic, so she goes to a witch to try and change her fate. Well this is were I get a little confused and even sick to the stomach. She basically asks the witch for a spell to CHANGE HER MOM. I thought '' woahhh what now?'' is this suppose to be the bravery we are about to see? Sp instead of just maybe wishing for a different fate and then all hell breaks loose.. she specifically asks that her mother be changed. Not even Ariel from the little mermaid asked that lol.( She had the bravery to actually switch out her tail fin not change her dad.) Am I really the ONLY daughter in the whole wide world who got sick at this? Merida gives her mom a CURSED CAKE and watches her mom get SICK, and all Merida is saying ' YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND YET MOMMY''?! Elinor gets ill and sick from the cursed cake while her heartless daughter practically gets high hopes off of this. Elinor then turns into a bear and the rest of the movie is about how cool Merida is trying to own up to her lil mistake. And everybody is OK with that. Merida doesn't really do, change, or mature into anyone. Its mostly her mother that does the changing. Well she changes her opinion on her daughter getting married and lets her off the leash. Which would have been nice... if she wasn't practically cursed in the process to learn her lesson on how to be a better mom. Merida and Elinor grow a closer bond with each other while Elinor being a bear and all, Merida even teaches her mom how to catch fish. The ending of the movie is just '' you gotta be brave enough to change your fate-destiny-mom' or something like that. At least Mulan was able to find a way to honor her family and find her true self. Pocahontas chose her people over running off with John smith. Merida... continues riding her horse and now has a great relationship with her mom. They even make a new tapestry together with Elinor being the bear...It would have been slightly better if the movie explained how being a housewife isn't the most horrible thing that can happen to a woman, but that not all girls should be that way either. And that whenever we have a problem with our mothers we should fix our moms. That doesn't come off as an independent brave princess to me. Sure Ariel runs away from home to go on land, but at least she didn't complain as much and just did what she wanted to do.I'm a teen who would rather just be rebellious on my own lil terms then ever consider changing my moms opinions. But I guess that's just me. (A more lengthy review of this movie can be read on amazon with my screen name WarriorQueen under 2 star rating)",Brave

And what happened to the witch? She just left an answering pot at her place and disappeared? Shouldn't she be brought to justice?Too many questions.However, I'll give credit where it's due. The animation quality is brilliant, the characters are endearing and the voice acting--even though I'm sure it isn't really accurate--is extremely likable. This is something we've come to expect from Pixar movies and it doesn't disappoint in that.On the whole, though, Brave is not Pixar's finest.",Brave
420,lovgrena,A quality change of fate for Pixar,7,17 June 2012,"Everything about Brave is different from the Pixar norm, save the unequaled attention to detail and quality.The Disney-Pixar animated feature focuses on Princess Merida as she searches for a way to change her fate. In a journey of magic, adventure and family, the fiery Scot is launched into the ranks of the elite Disney princesses. As odd and understandably foreign as the accents felt watching the early previews for the movie, the voice acting was executed following, creating very real characters that fit their animated molds perfectly. By the end of the movie, what once sounded foreign blended into the scenery and visuals to create a completely immersing environment.In fact, amid the magic spells and tall tales of times gone by, it's the historical, Scottish feeling that made Marida's journey and transformation (and that of her mother) that much more tangible and familiar.Underneath the folk-tale storyline lies the same life lessons that ring true for young and old. Though the movie heavily focuses on a mother- daughter relationship, it's not just for girls anymore than Mulan was. Merida is a true Disney princess, with gumption, heart and an uncanny connection with nature, but the story could have been told from a male perspective and rung just as true, making it easy to empathize with Pixar's first female lead.As has been the case with almost every other one of their movies, the company has reinvented the standard for animated visuals. The environments are based on real Scottish landmarks, adding real depth to the story, and the colors are as bright as they are grounded, creating a wonderfully real world. Such visuals lend credence to the upcoming 3D re-release of Finding Nemo, though not much, but also show just how far the studio has come. All of the elements put together, Brave is a different sort of movie than many were expecting. More focused on a single pair and their quest together, not to mention darker by far, the story of Merida was a leap of faith for the once small studio. Many will have their doubts, left wanting another heart wrenching love story from Up or creative take on a beat to death genre like The Incredibles. That was never the purpose. Just as with every one of their award-winning films (Cars 2 notwithstanding), a new movie means a new chapter, new story and new style of film.Taken for what it is, Brave is a remarkable step into a whole new style of movie, proving the creative teams at Pixar will continue to write their own fate.",Brave

422,van-holland,"A Great Tale told by Real Characters, with Lifelike Barriers.",9,5 July 2012,"Brave takes Pixar into a new land, and not only Scottish culture, but one geared to a more adult crowd. It also focused the film around two female characters in a mother-daughter relationship, something not done very often, nor done this well.The characters were all very well developed, with their attitudes and mannerisms matching their physical appearance. The voices were also really well done, and made for greatly entertaining characters. This was done so well that you actually felt for them as they experienced their separate challenges and trials. The story that develops between the mother and the daughter is done so well because of the great job they did in developing the separate characters.The interesting thing about the film was how the ""opposition"" was not a foreign nation, an evil king or any physical being, but was the barrier raised between the mother and daughter. Many a man can relate to such a barrier, and is more realistic than many movie villains, yet Pixar still expertly created the great bear ""Maudi"" to be a physical representation of what happens when you let those pride barriers stand erect too long. A great establishment of opposition. A+!!!All around a fantastic movie. The only thing that left me disappointed was the 3D aspect. The scenery was nice in some shots, but overall I didn't get ""drawn"" into the world as 3D is suppose to do. It played a very backseat role and was largely unnoticed. It was also rather distracting on every single camera pan, as the whole shot would go blurry for an instant. Not sure if this was just the theater I was in, but it definably left some room for improvement. But, there is no such thing as a perfect movie, right? All around, very well done Pixar. You've done it again!",Brave

If you expect a Pixar film, you will be left wanting.Though Brave is a competent fairy tale in the Disney tradition, it lacks the creativity and nuance I expect of Pixar films. I felt like I was watching Cinderella Meets Beauty and the Beast in CGI rather than the next story from the people who brought us Up, The Incredibles, Finding Nemo, and Toy Story.This is the first Pixar film I've seen which I feel is not worthy of a major Academy Award nomination. I hope this is not indicative of Disney's influence on their new subsidiary. If so, we've lost a great studio.",Brave

WOW",Brave
425,marianmurdoch,"Get a clue, Hollywood.",5,23 June 2012,"Saw Pixar's ""Brave"" last night. As usual, the animation was gorgeous. The rendering of Merida's horse was the best animation of a horse to date, and you just can't look away from the gorgeous curls of Merida's flaming hair. As for the movie itself, the first portion of the film had a heart to it, but as soon as Merida meets a witch in order to obtain a spell to change her fate, the movie devolves into the frenetic pratfall hysteria that directors think is needed to hold a child's attention. I watched the children lose interest during chase scene after chase scene. What I found ironic was that the short, La Luna, before the film, while silent and slowly unfolding the story, held the attention of the entire audience, young and old, much more than the fast-paced, in your face drama of the feature film. In face, at one point in La Luna, the entire audience breathed together an awe-struck, extended breath ""Whoaaaaa"" which will forever be one of my favorite theater moments. Like the first part of ""Up"", the audience didn't care that there were no words, they didn't care that there wasn't non-stop action. They lived in the joy as the movie showed us that quiet moments are sometimes the best treasures. Hollywood would be Brave to give us more of those moments.",Brave
426,rcorron,Still entertaining...,6,22 June 2012,"I give this film a 6/10. My judgement may be slightly critical, being a huge Pixar fan, though this film fell rather short of my expectations. I felt that it just didn't have the heartfelt Pixar magic put into it. Don't get me wrong it is a good movie, but for a Pixar movie it just lacked almost everything I love about Pixar. The thing Pixar does best and is most known for is creating memorable characters, and the character development in Brave was almost non- existent. Don't get me wrong, kids will enjoy this movie without a doubt, but for Pixar standards, much too formulaic and unoriginal in execution. After Cars 2, which is without dispute the worst Pixar movie to date, this one comes in at second to worst. The best part of the movie is the short La Luna which was pretty good. 8/10 for La Luna. I really hope Pixar can redeem themselves with their next feature film.",Brave

428,nsandhu-58-362397,Brave is All Heart,8,24 June 2012,"Brave is a big surprise. The Pixar produced and Disney distributed film is a story about mothers and daughters. There is no handsome Prince, but there is a Princess, a Queen, magic and a pesky witch. Oh and some bears.Pixar films are technically wondrous but can lack the warmth of the animated Disney Classics. With Brave they have finally broken that barrier. The film delivers a personal story and not, as the trailers seemed to suggest, Braveheart with a warrior princess.Our protagonist Princess Merida boasts an intricately animated mane that would make Rapunzel jealous. Merida is a tomboy and a rebel and doesn't show any signs of wanting to grow up. While her father King Fergus indulges her, mother Queen Elinor tries to teach her responsibility and constantly admonishes her to be a lady. Tensions ensue, particularly when Merida is faced with having to do her royal duty and keep the kingdom together.The plot twists into unexpected territory here – for good and bad depending on one's personal tastes, but it is refreshing nonetheless. Too many modern heroines are all ""girl power"" and not much else. Merida is a far better realized character, growing and maturing before our very eyes, and this is probably why the ending strikes such a false note. One suspects the resolution is more a result of pandering to modern tastes rather than organic growth in the characters.Nevertheless, credit goes to the script which truly captures the incredible complexity and tensions that characterize the mother-daughter dynamic, however fantastical the yarn gets. Brave sticks to a far more timeless storytelling style than most animated features today, with the now staple contemporary wise cracking of supporting characters kept to a minimum, and thankfully so. Not only do these jokes strike discordant notes that pull viewers out of the story, they ultimately serve to date these films far before their time.It will be particularly interesting to see how the film is received and reviewed internationally. Set in Medieval Scotland and clearly created with Western sensibilities in mind, the film has nonetheless harnessed some universal themes. I am South Asian, and the tensions between familial duty and individual desire resonated particularly well. I swear I've had the same confrontations with my own Mother.Is the story for everyone? No. The second half falls apart a little for anyone that doesn't care for (wo)man vs. beast, but ultimately this is an emotionally authentic film and worth a visit to the local cinema.Chickflicking",Brave
429,goebel-c,The makings of a classic,10,17 August 2012,"A classic is a most peculiar thing. It is a story that seems faintly familiar, like a path one has walked down a long time ago, and has almost entirely forgotten. It may not seem to be shiny and new, or to be exceedingly original, but there is a certain something about it that makes us read it (in the case of a book) or watch it over and over again. It does not lose charm through multiple viewings – they only add to our understanding. ""Brave"" is such a movie as I should bravely declare a classic. In the very best sense of the word. This film is thrilling. It's filled with magic, wonder, humour and action, with memorable characters and what's more, it conveys truly valuable messages. It may be a story about love, but it is on no account a love story like we have been used to see Disney do – without wanting to spoil anything which I (a girl who always hated the fact that the princess needed to be saved) particularly delighted in. It is in short, the sort of story I would have loved to bits as a child and that still admire now – with a heroine, who is certainly a better role model for any girl (and boy) than all of the Disney princes and princesses combined. This film is more than just entertainment, it has incredible moral value. But the entertainment doesn't fall short. It's hilarious, it's fast paced, it's full of suspense to the very last moment and it's absolutely visually stunning. The character animation is utterly gorgeous, real actors could hardly have been more convincing. It's 3D animation at its very best, and is well worth watching in 3D. The 3D is very well done and does not hurt the eyes, it is more like looking through a window than anything else and it really does add to the experience. There are two other things that I should like to recommend: Watch this film with your family, and stay for the credits. Not merely because of the after credits scene, which is lovely, but because the people who worked on it deserve it. I must admit, I dearly hope there will be no sequel. This film is so truly wonderful that it is very well able to stand on its own.",Brave
430,ital-anthony,"Had no expectations walking in, satisfied walking out",8,4 July 2012,"I really had no idea what this movie was about except it was made by pixar. I went in and it really didn't blow me away like other animated films such as tangled with the script but it was very good in its own way. It has a completely different sense of humour to other Disney films and quiet frankly I liked certain parts of it. Just a problem I noticed was they were trying to appeal the movie to both adults and kids and thats one thing I didn't really enjoy. Some scenes would be hilarious, but some scenes were just plain stupid and purely for kids entertainment. I wasn't surprised since it was a Disney film but it really did take me out of the experience of the seriousness of the film. But besides all that the emotions you experience while watching the film is awesome. I love films that make put you in the scenes and make you feel like you have a bond with the main character and feel the emotions they are feeling. Just before my conclusion I also want to compliment the animation, it was top notch, perfecto ;) So in conclusion with the awesome cgi, the decent script, the jokes that appealed to me half the time and the movie making me emotional in parts I give it a 7.5, so ill round it up to 8 ;)",Brave
431,jrwt54,So yes women are smarter,7,26 June 2012,"Brave on the surface seemed like a wonderful trip to the mythical land Scotland. And that's the biggest problem with the movie, it isn't. Instead we get dumb kings, whiny daughter and very little magic. On the positive side Meridoc is a great animated character. And let me just say that the animation was the standout. Horses that look like real horses, bears that look like bears. Back to the story, yes it was female centric but was it necessary to make the men so completely dumb. We should not have to dummy others up to up lift ourselves. Also this was just a repeat of the little mermaid without the romance. The witch was a cute addition but the story was weak and frankly a little scary for little ones. Just one more note the animated short that appears before the movie is priceless. Too bad Brave wasn't.",Brave
432,jessika-197,A Film Worthy of the Pixar and Disney name,10,30 June 2012,"This is a movie with stunning visuals, colourful characters, a unique story and all the emotion you'd expect from Pixar. This movie had me laughing at one point, and crying at another. Merida is a heroine worthy of your time, as we watch her grow as a character and learn valuable lessons. The story in itself is very original, different from the usual musical romances you'd expect from a princess film. I found it refreshing and tasteful, done in a way only Pixar could pull off. The music is beautiful, making up for the lack of singing animals. The animation is beautiful, certainly with a unique flair to it. Merida is a beautiful character with plenty of character traits and development, it's obvious lots of thought was put into her. Elinor was a three dimensional character with a distinct personality and plenty of character growth. The side characters are memorable and entertaining. I highly recommend this movie, not only for kids, but for adults too. This movie is worth your money and time, the Disney and Pixar name, and ultimately a place in your movie collection.",Brave

But this movie turned out to be wonderful! Fabulous animation (as always from the great and powerful Pixar), an unexpected storyline (with a twist on the usual mother-daughter strife), and a GREAT protagonist (Merida is like a fabulous, spunky Katniss Everdeen; and not just because of the archery). While this movie may be hard-pressed to ""beat"" Pixar classics like ""Up"" and ""Finding Nemo"", it still tells a wonderful story that thoroughly enthralled me for an hour and a half. And ""Brave"" definitely meets the high standards of Pixar's works. In short, this movie is super cute, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone; this is a story that anyone could watch and enjoy.",Brave
434,sella-dorra,Delightful but not very memorable,7,24 June 2012,"When you hear Pixar you think of the films that will likely be considered classics if they aren't so already. Here we are given a film slightly outside of Pixar's usual area of expertise, and though it wasn't necessarily graceful in its undertaking, it certainly tried. There were a lot of aspects to the film that deserve recognition. The environments were beautiful, the comedy hardly felt forced, and there were--as per Pixar style--a few good moments throughout the film. Unfortunately, it's not enough to give it standing next to its kin. We are given Merida, a stubborn princess who loves archery and desires nothing more than to change her fate. And sadly she is the biggest flaw. Merida is not a person. She is simply a girl who plays a role. This role is of a feisty woman who gives everything she has to defy the bounds placed on her. That's all she is. She has little to no actual desires, other than to defy. She wants what she wants, and ultimately gets it. Sure, she admits her mistakes and apologizes, but when it comes to compromise, she's all take and no give. She has no likability--she's tough, defiant, and these are all good traits, but you can't make a character come alive by these general traits alone. You don't hate her, but you can't really bring yourself to like her either. As for the other minor characters, though they are minor, they do bring some charm. The mother, who plays a more important role, is by far more developed and engaging. The saddest thing about this film, for me, is that it wasn't what I wanted. I didn't leave the theatre disappointed, per se, but I wanted more: especially from a company with a track record like Pixar's. I wanted a serious film with a good story and a cast of characters that were fleshed out. I wanted a film that took its audience seriously and brought us a beautiful fantasy, topped with relatable plights and a well-developed heroine. The film gave us a bit of this, but not to the level that I hoped, expected, and desired. It wasn't a let down. But I hope to see--at least after the god awful premise that is Monster's University is out of the way--that PIxar might head towards a trend similar to that of Ghibli or earlier Don Bluth. Pixar might be owned by Disney, but I don't want to see them ""Disneyfied"". All in all though, this film is at least worth watching. It's funny, charming, and despite its flaws had a lot of effort and love put into it.",Brave

However, this movie is not among the top Pixar films, by far. I felt the sickening presence of Disney all over the film -- weird politically correct preaching, overdone action scenes, and generally random and weird plot.The story is really disappointing. What exactly makes her 'BRAVE'?? They should have named the movie 'PETULANT'. She's selfish, and the entire plot is about how she can get out of the results of her selfishness while remaining selfish. The magic feels out of place, lots of wasted scenes, and the whole bear thing was just plain annoying after a while.Not a lot of funny moments, and generally boring!

The colors are so vivid, and you feel as if you are in the Highlands of Scotland. Wonderful plot, character development, humor, depth, folklore, parent/child/sibling relationships, music, and more. Lovely, spirited, freedom-loving main character Merida is a fantastic role model for girls and encourages every audience member to follow their heart's desires and want to dye their hair bright orange red. Great messages about love, forgiveness, tradition, putting yourself in another's shoes, and what it means to be brave and uniquely you. As other reviewer stated, the animated short before this film is wonderful and touches your heart as well. After wiping away tears, I felt so GOOD and UPLIFTED when leaving the theater. Don't wait for the DVD. Both the short and the feature film need to be seen on the big screen. I heard the colors in the 3D are not as vivid as the digital version, and for me, it felt very realistic in the digital format. Can't remember the last time I enjoyed a movie so much!

437,filmnoob007,A more mature and darker Pixar movie,8,8 July 2012,"Let me start by saying I am not a parent of any young child, and I am also not a child myself. I'm in that middle group called the 20 somethings and so I was questioning whether I should go to this movie at all. I ended up going with my younger sister and my mom and I am glad I went, and especially glad I went with my mom.This movie, I believe, is intended for older kids and their parents. There are a lot of moments that could be scary to little kids. And some of the main themes of the movie are hard for younger kids to grasp. I would recommend waiting for the DVD if you have young (under 6 yo or so) kids.Now this movie is not, to me, as good as some other Pixar movies overall. But I did feel the themes and the emotions this movie conveys are absolutely above many other animated Pixar movies. The movie was incredibly touching. The relationship between Merida and her mother is the underlying story. And seeing this and thinking about your relationship with your own mother, whether you are 10, 20, or 50, really helps bring this movie to life.Overall, not the best Pixar movie for most. But definitely still worthy of your money.",Brave
438,planninefromareafiftyone,"Not quite at par with Pixar's high standard, but a decent watch",6,12 July 2012,"Pixar can pretty much do no wrong, but they've had a few mediocre moments when they're not quite invincible, either. This movie is alright, but not really worth the money you'll need to shell out for a family of four.At once, there's a glimmer of Moulan, which was one of Disney's all-time poorest offerings. The elements of a teen girl wanting to prove her equality to her male peers and aspire to new things is betrayed by an attitude in these combat movies that actually says ""you should bash as many people's heads as you can simply because you can."" Princess Medea's selfish behavior doesn't help; she comes across quickly as a self- important brat, rather than the ""Brave"" heroine she is meant to represent. Her constant bickering with another character becomes tedious.That's the negatives, but there are many things to cite on the positive side of the ledger. You won't be bored by this movie; it has lots of action, clever dialogue, fun sub-plots, and a well-developed central thread of a story to tell. At the times when the main character is written as the brilliant heroine the writer meant her to be, it comes through with flying colors. Speaking of color; this is a Pixar film: get ready to experience their vivid imagery and masterful animation. The backgrounds are exquisite, the characters well defined. Even tiny details are not missed, such as a close-up of a hand injury.Kids will like it, and adults too--it appeals to different tastes with different levels of humor and drama. However, it's not quite at what I'll call the ""forever memorable"" level of movie making that Pixar often achieves.It's best to wait for this one to show up on cable or as a rental.",Brave

Of course that is what I expect from Disney's Pixar movies and this did not disappoint me. When I first saw the movie Up I had thought that no movie would be able to compare. I was happy to see that this was movie was good as Up. It is a lot better than I expected it to be. At times even my husband was crying.

440,admac-442-797892,Very disappointing,3,5 August 2012,"I felt compelled to write a review to counter all the excellent reviews that this movie has received.It is not excellent, in fact it is dull, celebrates disobedience and feels like two completely different stories taped together to make up the time.I can't really see the point of the movie, young girls in Scotland today (or the USA or even South Africa)are not forced to marry, in the tenth century when they were it was accepted and not the great drama made out in the movie.The whole movie reeks of feminist fantasy- wanting to live in a romantic Scottish medieval setting, sorting out mother issues and having modern rules and standards.I found it disturbing that every male character in the movie was portrayed as at best, big stupid and loving, (King Fergus) at worst violent and evil (the bear). They only males given any intelligence in the movie are the triplets, who are constant thieves, conniving, ruthless, destructive and very small! The basic story and message was if you are a young woman with serious mother issues, don't worry. Do something really nasty to your mother, then say you are really sorry then your mother will change her mind and you can have it all your own way! Don't worry about any men involved as they are too stupid to understand what is going on.A lot of this I could have forgiven if the movie did not feel so disjointed, and in the second half frankly boring. This is not ""How to train your dragon"" with a female lead (that would have been great) this is a feminist Disney ""Mother bear"" done very beautifully by Pixar, with great voice acting but ultimately very unsatisfying.",Brave

I am very disappointed that this film was billed as a fantastic and exciting plot. I really hope they do not make a sequel because I could not bare to sit through another version of the same story. I found the princess character annoying and selfish, this may be because I am older and perhaps young kids would empathise more with the central character.

Going deep and maybe attach a little bit darker side. Will be nice if the past was shown all, not just a piece of it.

Now, after some hours, i think i've got an idea about what is missing - the story is too didactic. By ""didactic"" I mean that story generally was not moved by heroine's choices, but by a mistake she once made. Like Robinson Crusoe's destiny was generally defined by his decision to leave father's house against his will. And every mistake is punished by fate. The crime and punishment theme is the one that creates heavy feeling in the movie, i think.

444,diana-a93,Pixar did it again !,9,7 November 2012,"**ATTENTION SPOILERS**I don't really know how to react towards this movie, i was thinking of all the good reviews it got and focusing on that 'it has to be good, it has to be good'Negative Points :The first 27 mins i was like 'Wow, nothing special yet, is this a Pixar movie ?', literally nothing special.I didn't like the beginning of it ! i thought it was too commercially if that's the right phrase, i barely smiled, and i disliked the triplets, i thought they're trying too hard to make them look cute !I thought it was somehow fast paced, especially when it comes to the connection between Mother and Daughter, even when a fast paced movie doesn't bore you, but in these scenes especially they should have been a bit slower and more detailed.Positive Points :It has Pixar's heart in it.The animation is definitely the best Pixar animation so far.The details are breathtaking, there is a lot of realistic stuff, yet some of the clearly-animated scenes to remind you that you're watching an animated movie, a very good one.The music is just perfect for the movie, with the scenes and the accent and the atmosphere, i thought it was just lovely and suitable for the movie, can't get any better for sure.Even though i didn't like the beginning of it, but the scene where they started to fight caught my attention, i thought it was beautifully animated/written/directed, i didn't get bored of the movie not even for a sec.The bonding scenes were fast paced true, but it convinced me a bit, it could have been better, but i think it was quite alright ! especially after we meet Mor'du.Like i said, it has Pixar's heart in it, Pixar's other movies got to me more, but i would be lying if i said that Brave didn't get to me in some scenes, which made me satisfied, since i got used to Pixar movies moving me.And one last thing, the four kings tale ? FREAKING AWESOME ! the story is amazing, and i loved how they put it in the movie, and how it ends, it's just  ahh, i wish they made the movie about it somehow !Characters :Merida : i like her, i love that she's kinda immature and a bit selfish ! and her reactions towards her mother ! she would rank 6th or 7th on my list ! i'm not sure though.Elinor : I thought the changing of personality kinda surprising and sudden, but meh, i liked her as a bear more.Fergus : Fun .. and well, fun !The Triplets : No, just no !Mor'du : i don't care if he didn't say a word and barely was there, i love him.It's not the best Pixar movie, but it's really good, definitely worth watching. I know i have to watch it again, i may change my mind about some things.",Brave
445,shevies,Misunderstood story but I'm giving it a thumbs up.,7,18 October 2013,"I did not understand why the movie was named ""Brave"" because bravery had nothing to do with this story. Like the name there were some parts of the movie which was out of place like when they used the word ""destiny"" and ""fate"". Using those words actually made us expect something which the movie never delivered. Even though the story had some missing elements, the story was still a meaningful one which I believe mothers and teenage daughters can relate to. Most teenage girls see their mothers as people who are trying to rip their freedom away. And during this time mothers also find it difficult to understand their daughters and conflicts arrive because they can't communicate properly. But as time goes by their experiences together makes them bond, and they understand each other and compromise. This is exactly what happens in Brave.Merida like every young girl wants freedom, she has her own ideas and she is part of a new generation. Her mother Queen Elinor, like every mother wants what's best for her daughter but they find it difficult to communicate and understand each other. In the beginning of the movie Merida wants to use magic to change her mother and takes a bad decision. As the movie progresses Merida understands her mother and her mother understand Merida. As she bonds with her mother, Merida starts regretting her decision and breaks down when it seems like the effects of her bad decision is going to be permanent. Even though it's not what we expected, there is a message you can learn from this story, and I like how this story focused on other relationships and values besides scoring a handsome prince. Animation and artwork is absolutely beautiful. It has the right balance of humor and seriousness. It's a family movie, and a movie girls will find interesting as they might have experienced similar emotions.Thumbs up!",Brave
446,laurabittner,Why Merida Will Never Be Mulan,7,4 July 2013,"If I say anything here that seems like a spoiler for this movie, or for another movie...I'm sorry. I'm warning you right now....This movie isn't bad. It just isn't outstanding, either. I think most of the adult audience is unhappy with this flick, because we now have to adjust our expectations, and accept this fact. When it comes to folklore, folk tales, fairy tales, and especially princesses--- both PIXAR and Disney have lost their ""magical"" touch. (Hint: it sort of ended around the time of Tangled/ Rapunzel).I have nothing against Brenda Chapman. She tried to create a heroine that would top Mulan. That was a tall order, and Chapman missed. What she created was a girl with some decent traits (outdoorsy, spirited, resourceful, loves her family unit)--- but who has NO SELF-CONTROL AT ALL. I have watched Merida multiple times on screen, now, and the thing that always arises in my mind is simply... Merida, why can't you contain yourself enough to act equitably? Yes, your mother has done you a disservice, by not allowing you to be privy to ""this life-altering decision,"" but why can't you be fair to her? Why couldn't you take the high road? Mulan took the high road. After she stood up at the dinner table and petulantly made her disagreement known--- she also did something very special. Mulan grabbed her self-control, and decided to think about how she could possibly improve the situation for both her and her parents. Mulan sacrificed her life and her identity... for her father's. Where do you do that, Merida? You, Merida, do not have much of a sacrificial spirit at all, even at the close of your story. You are simply wracked with guilt for having chosen poorly.I actually like you, Merida. I do. (I've even crocheted you into a doll, now, that's how passing fond I am). You have some strong qualities, and you are resourceful. But until you not only ask for forgiveness, but also master SELF-CONTROL in your life--- you are NOT much of a role model for any young girl. Being BRAVE does not mean you act UNJUSTLY, and cease to respect others. Being BRAVE means you think about your actions, their potential consequences, and how to sacrifice yourself for your fellow man or woman. Mulan was able to do this---so she was a lot BRAVER than you are.",Brave
447,emmathomde32,Beautiful movie,10,28 July 2013,"What a fantastic film that has gotten such a terrible backlash.Reasons for backlash:1)People hate princess films and according to them it is the same as the others. Well anyone with an iota of intelligence will tell you that each princess film has a different story, a different message and a different but ever so present soul. We live in a society where two characters who have the same hair color and different faces and different personalities are viewed by the masses of people to be identical and the same person because people are superficial and so this film has a princess and that one SINGLE fact makes the film the SAME as all other princess films. Oh how intelligence has plummeted.2) This is story about tradition and myth. That is part of the core of the tale. We live in a society with no tradition or real culture other than pop culture. So obviously the turmoil of the leads will go over the heads of the masses. I have friends who have been in situations where they were forced to marry someone and refusal to do so would have ghastly consequences for their families. It is real and heart breaking. In our society however people sleep with a hundred people before and even after marriage and can marry and divorce as they please without giving a rat's ass for their families who could suffer the brunt of their decisions. We live in a selfish society so obviously putting ourselves in the shoes of or even imagining what Merida and her mother go through and their reasons will not register with millions. No one will understand how breaking tradition could have disastrous consequences. They have no idea how in other countries how tradition and culture is a backbone of societies other than ours. people cannot in our society put themselves into the shoes of others as we are too selfish. And that is the truth.3) This story has legends and stories, myths, tales that guide our heroines. In a society without stories that date thousands of years, cautionary tales and tales of truths to guide us, i doubt the impact of that will reach the minds of the public. Though abroad many and i mean many nations have tales, legends that date back thousands of years before our country received its name. These tales would guide people and be sources of moral and brainy wisdom for the children and adults. So obviously that went over everyone's heads. People in other countries hundreds upon hundreds of years ago used these legends and myths, these tales, to grow as a people.And to this day people in such countries still tell these tales to their kids as a moral message, teaching and preventing history from occurring.4) Apparently it has no humor and people want humor over substance. I mean anyone seen The Hangover trilogy. Well people loved it as it shows what society is all about and that is public mindset.5) It is about a mother-daughter story, it has moral messages and a lot of deep meaning. Apparently that means it is 'cliché'. What an overused word by the pseudo intellectual pretentious idiots who lack profound sense and think substance and sweetness is cliché just because they are sick douches. Half the time they don't even know what it means. I mean these days the word cheesy is used to describe anything with substance, sweetness, kindness, soul and love. And so something with profound wisdom and sheer lovely heart is considered cheesy while on the other hand depraved psycho disgusting buffoonery is considered amazing. Oh how far moral and substance has fallen in this society and how pretentious pseudo-intellect has taken over. Wisdom and profound thought and substance is dead or according to the depraved superficial and supposedly know it all generation 'cheesy'. Our society is so egoistic and full of itself that it cannot be educated or told great messages since according to them, they know everything and no one should dare question that by putting a real message in a movie. Even if these people know nothing they still must be considered to be the greatest and smartest. People hate their families or have been so poorly raised and some in favor of pets or vice versa where pets are considered better family than people so obviously their hate for the real meaning of life and family and love which they look down upon is 'cheesy' and 'cliche'. Well that is society for you and i hope that great movies with substance don't get the boot in favor of what such people want.",Brave
448,haln-889-733486,"About 'Breaking Traditions', but quite the opposite is true for Disney",5,10 March 2021,"Another princess movie where the princess goes on a self absorbed journey of improving their own life without really aiming to help anyone else or fight for real justice. In this case even put others' life at risk carelessly and without any feeling of guilt or responsibility.In this movie, the self absorbed journey manifests itself as trying to break traditions. Traditions of unfair distribution of wealth? Traditions of minimising social mobility? Underappreciating the hard work of the common people? No, all of those are fine with her, just the betrothal part, because that is what is preventing her life from continuing to be perfect.It isn't a terrible movie, its just annoying to see another opportunity Disney had to explore the breaking of many traditions of royalty and privilege, or at least show that its not all about those born into wealth and status.Ok the central plot shouldn't necessarily have to be about those topics, but at least there could have been some nice elements. Whereas for example, there are people working to prepare the royals' food in a cramped dark kitchen. She just walks in without even acknowledging them and takes a plate full of cakes they'd prepared; unecessarily unappreciative. Also, in princess movies there's usually some kind of loving relationship between princess and animal(s). In this case there isn't, there is a horse used as just a vehicle to help her and again is barely acknowledged and underappreciated.In summary this movie is all about the princess getting what only she wants for herself. Anyone and everyone else is ignored. No one gets hurt in the end though (by sheer disney luck as usual!) despite the princess' selfish reckless actions.Generic dull soundtrack as usual, with minimal cultural influence to match the setting, just like with Pocahontas, Mulan and pretty much every other Disney film that is set in a very rich culture and uses generic american pop trash sing songs as soundtrack.",Brave

I didn't have any expectations, at first i thought that it was gonna be another boring cartoon but i was pleasantly surprised.Animation: Everything looked pretty, even her hair, but i thought that she wasn't created with much details other than that (or at least my eyes were not drawn to them!); the landscapes were beautiful and +1000 points for the scene were she shoots the arrow because it was really well done.Plot: I loved the plot because it wasn't about her finding the love of her life and them marring and living together forever, the main point was family instead. It contained some clichés, true, but i enjoyed it nonetheless.In the end, for me, this movie wasn't as bad as people make it to be; I've had red haired kids and friends my age tell me how happy they were to finally feel included in a cartoon and i felt SO happy for them. I think that this movie was the start of a different generation of princesses and i'm totally okay with it; The stories may be full of clichés but isn't it better to have strong and independent princesses more than docile princesses that just need a prince to live better?",Brave

Beside the human heroin, the story was also mediocre that everyone can figure out the ""happy end"" when the story just begins.

Without that, it's just a movie with pretty graphics.Brave is just an average film. The main thing this movie is lacking is originality. I have seen movies with disagreeing daughters and mothers, I have seen movies with Witch spells gone awry, and I have seen movies where people turn into animals. All of this has been done before! This movie is filled with tropes I have seen twenty times before, and I was unable to get invested in the story because I already knew how it was going to end.It certainly isn't a terrible movie (I wouldn't even say it's a bad movie), but it's definitely one of Pixar's weakest films.

Including...Great Pixar variance that I see getting underrated. I make a claim about Brave's place, in terms of looks. Show a general idea of how it should be looked at. I be sure to think of these movies objectively. Goes along with the idea that these movies are literally written for everyone. No target audience...

458,alexandriad,"Different, but stunning. Absolutely breathtaking.",10,19 November 2012,"I find it unfortunate that this film has received so much negativity from other viewers. In all honesty, this is definitely one of my favorite Pixar films and a movie I will cherish in my heart for a long time.The reason I loved this film was because I related so much to it. Being a female in my late teens, I was able to connect to Merida and empathize with her. The parts I found most relatable dealt with Merida's feelings of suffocation from her mother and quest to have independence to make her own choices. Another aspect that I really loved was the whole female protagonist and a ""princess movie"" that was not a typical princess movie which is something I truly appreciated. After all, Disney (don't get me wrong, I love Disney princess films) practically trademarked princesses and gave them an underlying characterization as young, pretty girls who without fail end up with young, handsome princes. Brave strips away that ""damsel in distress"" and for once allows the princess to act as a true heroine. After all, not every princess has to end up with a prince in the end.I found the animation to be stunning and the music added a certain charm and allowed me as the viewer to be transported to Scotland. All I can say is this movie honestly made me rethink my attitude. After watching it I quickly texted my mom in tears an ""I love you"" and allowed me to truly appreciate everything she has done for me despite my desires to have independence. While this movie may not be for everyone, I still strongly encourage you to watch it. This movie really hit home for me and I left in bittersweet tears.",Brave

Without spoiling anything, it is safe to say that Pixar/Disney did not explore a completely fantastic and heartfelt story opportunity which even shows it self early on in the movie. Instead it turns into a Laurel and Hardy flick with no depth to reach the hearts of the audience.Elements lending them selves to 25 years of gaming clichés does not help the over all expression. (Visps - you know it when you see it, they are in the trailer as well) Following epics such as Wall.E and Up this feels awkward in many ways. Pixar might change lanes, they might not. Earning money by making sub-par productions has never opted a change of style though.Pixar has run out of the famous ""napkin movies"", then made Up which turned out fantastic, hopefully they'll figure out how to ""do it"" again.",Brave

It has funny characters (the kids), beautiful scenery, and a kinda good moral story for children. I'd recommend this movie for 6-12 y/o kids.Unfortunately, the plot is totally cliché. It contains some meaningless scenes and lacks twists. Almost ALL the details of the story are predictable ... what kind of characters will appear, what will happen to the boys, what needs to be done, how the story will end,... I was looking forward to seeing how ""Brave"" Merida is, and it turns out to be quite disappoint.

A lot of the movie was shot in dim light, so watching with the glasses you just can't see what is going on or at best cannot see the detail of the sets or characters. Don't they think about this when they produce the final edit? I took my glasses off for the last 10 minutes because I was fed up struggling to see the detail.

Indeed family lessons are learned, especially between a mother and a daughter. It is a great coming of age story with a legalistic mother and a freedom loving daughter. There are a lot of good messages in the storyline.CON: There is a darker side to this story than what has been seen previously in Disney and Pixar productions. Scary scenes are pushing the envelop of a kid-friendly movie. There is some off-color humor that does not add an ounce to the story. We are forced to deal with the servant woman's cleavage scenes and Merida's brother diving in at one point. There was the mooning scene of one of the Lords and of course the bare backsides of all the men after climbing down the castle wall. These scenes definitely pushed this into a PG+ movie.",Brave

(not a big 3d fan) From the very beginning of the movie, when the ""demon bear Mor'Du"" attacks, to the end credits, I felt very pulled in by the storyline. There were a lot of suspenseful moments. A few crude jokes that were more for the amusement of older viewers. But, overall, I thought it was a fantastic movie.I thought that Merida's character was very well understood, from a viewer's point. Her witty sarcasm and goofy antics made for a very interesting and entertaining main character. The little brothers, who always caused trouble were hilarious throughout the movie. Honestly, it was hard not to laugh, at quite a few scenes.As a person, who enjoys Disney/Pixar films and is not a big fan of movies like 'American Pie', I thought that this was suitable for kids but, also very good fun for young adults, like myself. My mom was even laughing at most of it. There were quite a few adults walking out by themselves, with no kids, to the showing before ours.It's a good movie to take the kids to. But, also, not what you'd expect from Disney/pixar, which makes it a bit unexpected.

465,PerryLoganClone,Next time use a script,2,27 January 2013,"In this review, I'm criticizing the storytelling craft of the film and am assuming a complete knowledge of the story. So this review definitely has spoilers. Don't let a crusty reviewer spoil your fun.OK--we need to tell the Pixar people they should have a script before they start their projects. This movie had every sign of having been made up as it went along.The story sets the viewer up for a tale of a young warrior--and does a very nice job of it. The early scenes in which we meet the heroine were the best part of the movie.Yes, I liked her, too.But the plot wobbles, then veers off eccentrically, mutating into some sort of comedy about being turned into a bear.This might work if the character being transformed were one we could identify with. But it is the mother--in effect the villain of the story--who becomes the bear, and we are invited to enjoy comedic shtick--beautifully realized by the artists involved, one must say--of a person turned into a bear.To speak bluntly: they should not have gone with bears at all, much less someone being transformed into a bear. As I say, we were set up for the tale of a young warrior, and we got this weird shtick.There should have been a character to balance the girl--another warrior or something like that. I say this because the movie itself seems to set us up for that.The climax involves the father--who, like all the other characters in the movie, has only one attribute--and he becomes a supremely idiotic and menacing figure at the end, which strikes me as more bad storytelling.Why does Hollywood always think it can get along without writers? Sometimes it works; sometimes we get these strange concoctions.The result is a very odd tale indeed--a sort of shaggy bear story--whose import seems to be that you can get out of responsibilities by pulling a dirty trick on your mother. With that message, should you let your kids see this? (Just kidding.)",Brave

The protagonist, Merida, is a lovely and smart red-hair girl who instantly makes you fall in love, and the introduction of the story is just like wow. The thing is: I did not enjoy the story at all; I expected more than a mother-daughter relationship movie, which is something that we have seen before. It sounds cliché in a way. I think ""Wall-E"", ""The Incredibles"", and ""Up"" are still #1s. Yet, ""Brave"" is a seriously touching movie, and I think you (parents and kids) can learn a lot from it.

Loved how the film did not pander to typical Disney Princess conventions, but showcased strong female characters who can kick butt and take names. King Fergus and the Clan leaders are a hoot. The film is also a moving postcard for Scotland. I've been to Castle Urquhart on Loch Ness and it is just as beautiful in the film as it is in real life. Hopefully, this film will inspire more Scottish vacations as it is a stunningly beautiful place.Bottom line is that this is a must see family film of the Summer.

In the same lines of Up, Brave gives us a story that is not a slapstick junk fest but a slightly more serious plot.Apparently all these people who complain how this movie is a rip off of Mulan and Brother Bear don't overly remember those movies. It seems that people love to complain that there aren't enough female, strong leads in children's films but then when they get one compare it to something that it barely resembles.You get the plot by now, a young Scottish woman wishes to not be married off and in a fit of anger, seeks a spell to change her fate. Of course the spell goes array and we end up with bears in a castle.It is darker, especially the middle and end where our Merida is often put in life threatening situations. With so many kids movies relying on stupid old jokes, slap stick moments, and bodily function jokes...I'm glad we have a movie like Brave.And it is nice to finally have a Disney movie where the female doesn't end up tying the knot. Pretty much every movie they crank out, even claiming a strong independent female lead, they always fall in love and get married and POOF happy ever after. There is too much sugar coated junk out there for kids...Brave gives us a serious, slightly dark Scottish tale steeped in magic and has a few giggles.",Brave
469,xavygravy,Please: DO NOT support the decline of a once great film studio,4,28 June 2012,"Mix Brother Bear with almost any princess film and this is what you get. The characters (surprisingly for Pixar) were poorly developed; this is especially true for the mother, where I was expecting some kind of back story, or at least a more believable development of the mother-daughter relationship. But no, apparently you're best buddies again and the mother will just change her mind on everything she believed previously, through a single fish-catching montage. ...Really? And don't get me started on 'the bad guy'. This 'evil bear' appears in only two scenes - one in which they escape from him, and one in which he returns and then gets squashed by a rock. In fact, the story would have been almost identical had the 'bad guy' been cut out of the script entirely.Perhaps you could blame the complete underdevelopment of the plot and characters on the relatively short runtime (100 minutes, minus the equally disappointing 'short' at the beginning). But that wouldn't make sense, as Toy Story 3, a brilliant film, had the same running time.I suspect that they are cutting back their effort on all fronts (writing, production time) bar animation, knowing full well that people will pay for their films regardless, so 'why bother?'.Following the equally mediocre Cars 2 with this, it's clear that Pixar really needs to step up their game.So please, do not support the decline of a once great film studio.",Brave
470,viveksantayana,"Pixar at its creative best, Brave is the studio's most elaborate and poignant story with a narrative replete with subtle nuances and a story with tremendous heart.",9,4 August 2012,"Resonant with Finding Nemo, Brave is a deep, moving meditation on parental love in the midst of simmering adolescent rebelliousness. While Finding Nemo takes the form of an Odyssean epic, Brave develops into an immaculate folk legend delivered with a seamless subtlety. The story draws from a well of thorough historical and cultural research. Equally uncompromising is the dazzling wit that is characteristic of a Pixar film and a brilliant voice cast that carries the humour spectacularly. The creative imagination is widely-inspired, with distinct overtones of the warm, loving playfulness of Disney, sincerity and maturity of Pixar, heart-warming soundtrack like Dreamworks and the magic of Studio Ghibli. At the emotional core of the film is an overwhelming story about a mother's love for her daughter. Brave is as much about Merida as Finding Nemo is about Nemo. It is Queen Elinor's story, as the latter is Marlin's.The story itself is crafted brilliantly, with a level of thought that surpasses most of Pixar's previous productions. On the surface, the film swiftly retorts to and parodies Disney's model of princess stories. For starters, the marriage plot is realistic: Merida is forced into marriage not by adamant parents who do not believe in love (and vehemently believe in class hierarchy), but by the requirements of a political alliance between the Lords and King. This is especially significant in Scottish history, where princesses and betrothals are of immense political significance in a feudal age around the time of Viking conquest. The buffoonish male characters and caricatured Princes Charming are a clever subversion of Disney's anodyne faerie tale endings: the strength and independence of female characters in Brave was so obvious that Merida accomplishes a feat 'only the ancient kings were brave enough to do' in the opening credits. There are also token Scottish clichés (haggis, kilts and drinking) as well as witty Scottish in-jokes (Doric accents and the Wicker Man Festival). The first act is essentially a light-hearted ceilidh that parodies the Disney formula and also sets up a sharp contrast for the darker tone of the film in subsequent sections.While launching itself off a clever and subversive parody of Disney princesses, the film turns sharply into a folk legend inspired by Celtic lore around forests, stone circles and the beliefs of spiritual communities situated in the highlands. The symbolism is very subtle: the recurrent bear trope, the Witch's woodcarvings that resembled pagan sculptures, the offhanded nod to the Wicker Man and the trope of the wills-o'-the-wisp. Like in Finding Nemo, the narrative is aware of its own textual structure: Marlin's adventure is passed on through word of mouth like how classical epics were in ancient Greece. Similarly, Elinor and Merida are aware of the significance of legends and folk tales as the story of the ancient kingdom converges with the central plot to build towards its climax. As the film culminates in Merida weeping and praying for her mother to change back, the Lords are shown standing with their sons and the triplets are cringing behind their father. Even the film short that ran before the film, La Luna, was a primer for the trope of parenthood.Carrying this heavy story is a vibrant cast of well-written characters (and deeply enjoyable performances by the glorious cast). Beneath the boisterous and buffoonish exterior, the men were brave, loyal and loving. Even each of the triplets have distinct characteristics about them. Merida's character arc is an honest story of adolescence, as the conflict between her and her mother arise out of misunderstood love and mutual hesitation: neither wants to hurt the other, but they always hesitate to speak to each other. Queen Elinor, the heroine, is the proper lady of the Throne. She embodies the dilemma between being mother and being queen: she herself had made many sacrifices in her life, growing up to be Queen, and therefore expects her daughter to have the same sense of duty and obedience. But when she sees her daughter straitjacketed by the ceremonial dress or when she sees how her throwing Merida's bow in the fire crushed her daughter, she was overwhelmed by her dilemma.Bringing all of this together is an intricate plot: the dramatic irony as Fergus attacks his bear wife, who he mistakes to be a wild bear in his disbelief in magic, causes most of the tension in the charged climax. But even the subtler details, ones the film never draws obvious attention to, are carefully nuanced: the necklace Merida exchanges for the spell cast on her mother was an heirloom, last worn by her mother on her birthday. The set pieces themselves are replete with symbolism as the story revolves around the stone circle. The opening scene, as Elinor rides away with Merida, foreshadows the rest of the film and the story is complete in a full circle as Merida and Elinor ride into the woods together. Even the poignant soundtrack, which itself is both beautiful and authentic, lends itself to the story: the songs are about Elinor (except, of course, the opening theme 'Touch the Sky') and how she is confined by the crown and by her hesitation and how she longs to right her relationship with Merida more than Merida does with hers with Elinor.Although not as quirky as Pixar's acclaimed classics, like the journey of toys aware of their own pernicious commercial status or the love story of an anthropomorphic trash compactor, Brave is a radical film for the studio, brilliant in its own right and towering above its contemporaries (the closest second being Dreamworks's How To Train Your Dragon, which is almost textbook and insipid in comparison). Brave is heartfelt and intelligent in its story, clever and sharp in its humour and sincere and unpatronising in its delivery; it may not be the best of Pixar, but it is undoubtedly its greatest film and a watershed for animated cinema.",Brave
471,paleblackarnmlr,"Not perfect, but it's a very presentable film.",7,24 June 2012,"I walked into this movie more worried then I was excited, mainly because of mixed reviews I'd gotten. After experiencing it for myself, I found that it was a pretty enjoyable movie. It was the warm movie that typically comes from a Pixar film. The animation was by far the most beautiful to date, and the characters were very lovable. The only problem I have was how some of the scenes, including character bonding moments, seemed sped along. I found that if these scenes had been longer or even more emotional, that I would have begin to connect to characters more. Even so, each set of characters brought a different sort of humor with them, making this a movie that will have you laughing and giggling at every turn. This is definitely a Disney/Pixar film, so it comes with everything you should expect from. Take that as you will, but it is still a solid movie that brings viewers on a unforgettable trip.",Brave

Then when i hear about Brave i was so excited!! This movie was great! It's a little scary at times, most of the little kids cried once or twice and i was a little scared at times myself! But the trailers for the movie don't do it justice! It's about a lot more than a girl's struggle for freedom for her responsibilities as a queen and other kingdomly duties. Its chuck full of adventure and it's very funny! It is definitely family friendly, be just be warned your little ones may get scared. In my theater a little boy screamed just about every time anything loud happened. A MUST SEE for any Disney fan!!",Brave

And the second thing is; how do I write about it without being a spoiler? I generally like these types of movies. I like the Lion King, and the Kung Fu Panda movies. I liked Rapunzel. This one to me went off in a kind of weird direction. The story was not just sort of odd, but it was not quite compelling enough. And the humor was not enough to fill in the gaps. I saw the movie on the same billing with Madagascar 3, which I thought was more entertaining.Brave was not a bad movie -I gave it a 7- I just thought it would be better.",Brave

Brave was simply a scene-for-scene mash-up of How to Train your Dragon, Tangled, Spirited Away, and Brother Bear. That was it, nothing new was even added- Except naked people. When the camera dives into excessive cleavage and then male nudity is put on display on more than one occasion, then you know that you have yourself a family-friendly Animated feature-film! There were only three mistakes that Pixar has ever made: Ratatouille, Monsters Inc (the second half of that movie can put even children to sleep), and Brave. I hope that their upcoming Dinosaur movie makes up for this ones shortcomings.",Brave
475,Ciuffini,Yaya Toure,5,11 December 2012,"I am a 19 year old boy who went to see this film in the cinema on my own, not out of choice but because Yaya Toure scored a goal past my keeper from a central position 40 yards out on FIFA while my house mate shouted Brave. I was disappointed by Neuer as the low drive bounced before entering the net. Due to this ridiculous rule I took the trip to the cinema to uphold my end of the deal, fair to say I received some suspicious looks and confused a few people.I would like to say I went with an open mind but I did not particularly, I sat down feeling strange but when the short film 'La Luna' came on, I actually loved it. At first I was confused and thinking this was only going to be a bad trip, however it was really good, and made me laugh on a good few occasions. Then Brave began and I had a slightly more open mind, however the Scottish accents that occurred were very strong and made for hard listening from the beginning, it was probably this that closed my mind for the rest of the film. I did not warm to many characters, the mother was a stuck up lady dog, no other word for it, the father was average with some comedic moments and the main character, whose name I can't even remember now, was the least likable character in the film. She was a selfish misunderstood teen who claimed hate to her mother, which was the only relatable thing about her. I have no idea why the film was called brave, she showed no real outstanding bravery, and was simply rectifying her mistakes. The fact the witch involved could only turn people into bears was a very poor idea and made things ridiculous, and the evil bear Mordue was as selfish and misunderstood, yet was seen as the evil villain. Instead it should have been the princess for causing this to have been caused upon her mother, who I didn't even feel sorry for. I did not expect to come and see a film about a teenagers relationship with her mother develop from hatred to love and understanding, particularly with it being called Brave and the princess brandishing a bow and arrow on the poster. There were two things I enjoyed about this movie, the three triplets and the pronunciation of the bear ""MORRR-DUEEE"". The children were funny and I enjoyed their antics throughout, even when they were also turned to bears, they were given a decent amount of screen time also possibly raising the films rating by a good few stars. I may seem like a close minded, negative person but when it comes to Disney I actually love it, my mum has an obsession with it and this has rubbed onto me but I did not enjoy this film, however the trip was not wasted due to the brilliance of ""La Luna"".",Brave

I found all the characters likable and fun and filled with genuine Scottish charm and ruggedness.The movie may be a bit long for younger children, my friend and I were sitting behind a couple with three kids in the theatre and the youngest one kept falling asleep and wanted to go home.

I expected this epic adventure with the interesting red head and the awesomeness of her archery skills, what I saw was a girl chasing around little floaty things because she turned her mother into a bear and was trying to fix it. Besides the scene where she kicks ass in the archery competition, she doesn't even use her skills at any other point in the story. I don't even know what to say, the storyline was boring and completely unoriginal, and the story has nothing to do with what the trailer showed it to be. Besides the few comedic moments that all animations have, this movie was quite bland and useless, and if it weren't for the money I paid to watch it, I would've walked away from it before it ended.

Without adding spoilers, the trailer implies it's about a girl standing up for herself in a male competition, but it's only a very small portion of the overall theme.

I hate to say or but Pixars last two attempts have proved me wrong. They have moved away from the mantra of the story making the film what it is and relied too heavy on the visual design of the film. Don't get me wrong Brave is a true piece of art visually, but it lacks the true heart and soul of films like Up and Wall-e. I just felt like I was being force fed Disney princess garbage again (a recent trip to the supermarket proves this as the entire toy aisle was Brave merchandise).

There is a Scottish Princess named Meridia who wants to be an adventurer and fight the good fight just like her father (Like Kayley in Quest for Camelot). Unfortunately her mother, Queen Eleanor, wants her to be the ""typical princess"". Meridia is to be betrothed to a chosen prince. Of course she doesn't want that and these wisps lead her to a witches cottage where she asks for a spell to change her mom (The Little Mermaid) The spell comes in a form of a cake. When the mother eats the cake she turns into a bear (Brother Bear). In order to break the spell they must ""mend the bond by pride"", the bond being their relationship (Like in Freaky Friday) I will not reveal the ending even though you can probably guess what happens.

I would understand if the societal values were portrayed as negative/wrong/evil but they are not necessarily so -- only insofar as the daughter is concerned. It is possible to grow into your own ""path"" in life while still being respectful. Granted, everything always turns out OK in the end (it IS Pixar/Disney after all).

Its one of the things we love most about Pixar and I feel its why we didn't give it more stars! If the choices for recommending this film were: watching it in theaters, renting it from a red box, or waiting a month after release to see it at a drive in, I would suggest this as a red box film.

But it turns out not. That is the good point about the movie.Now here are what went wrong. 1. Right out out the theater, I was arguing with my 9 year old daughter that the movie should not be named Brave. The reason is because I did not see act of bravery that is worthy for the movie to be named Brave. Not in Merinda, and not in anybody else. I believe a more appropriate name would be Bear, because the movie is all about bear, right from the beginning toward the end.2. The archery skill of Merinda is completely useless. What is the point of showing her with superior archery skill when all she does with the skill is a few unnoticed random shots at a bear. I thought I would see some epic arrow shooting like the one in War of Arrows, but it was a complete disappointment. With or without the archery skill, it makes no difference to the character, neither does it make her look anything braver.3.

It is inappropriate for kids under 13 in my opinion, which makes me wonder why they even bother making these movies?

So there were four princes who were given equal power by the king, but one of the princes wanted it all, and this caused the kingdom to crumble. Elinor was using this legend to make Merida become a proper princess and get married. I really fail to see the connection between the story and her current situation. I also didn't really catch what the wayward prince did to be cursed into a mindless bear by the witch. And the witch is suppose to be good? She basically killed the prince and was willing to kill Elinor (turn and leave her as a bear) just to teach Merida a lesson? What lesson is this? The mother-daughter family bond? Because it really doesn't tie into the wayward prince legend at all. The tapestry with the queen being cut off, and the prince and his stone tablet being broken off, are you telling me Elinor is power hungry? No it doesn't make sense to me at all.It was suppose to be about changing your destiny and doing so bravely, but what destiny? No one is really keeping Merida from having fun riding a horse, shooting arrows, and exploring the woods. It doesn't push the whole caged princess theme very strongly. She seems perfectly free to do whatever she wants, and eat whatever she wants. The king and his subjects and allies are all fighting brutes and heavy drinkers, jolly without a care in the world. The only one who even tries to keep order is Elinor. She is perfectly fine and loving as a mother from all the flashbacks, but wants to keep some order and good relations among the various clans. This whole propriety thing isn't really even supported in the backdrop. I didn't even know they were suppose to be royalty in the beginning of the movie. I thought he got kinged for defeating the bear, in the beginning anyway, because they sure weren't living the life of luxury in the beginning. And Elinor was suppose to be married off? And have ladylike qualities and upbringing? Maybe more responsible than the others. And the primitive land and people. All doesn't really support the caged princess thing.Elinor never needed to be changed, nor her destiny. Merida needed to stop acting like a stubborn brat, and her destiny was far from set in stone. She bravely changed it...how? Who is being brave here? And then they throw in a ""you should do whatever you want to and be true to yourself"" speech out of nowhere. They never did elaborate on why Merida had to be married in the first place, what purpose it would accomplish, and who actually cared, because it seemed no one, especially none of the clansman, really cared.And the will-o-wisp was the soul of the transformed prince, trying to get Merida to kill him and free his soul? Or maybe he wanted someone else to turn into a bear to commiserate with him by leading her to the witch? The prince was selfish so that made some sense that the witch transformed him into a mindless bear, but unlike Beauty and the Beast, he will never be able to transform back and live his former life. The only peace he can get is to be killed off and his misery ended? Still don't know why Elinor was transformed into a bear and what major lessons it was suppose to instill in her, or merida, and how this was suppose to be a bonding experience, or a change destiny lesson, or anything effective as such or make any sense.",Brave

494,Davinarush1,Another Pixar hit!,10,4 July 2012,"Merida (Kelly Macdonald) is a free-spirited young girl with fiery red unkempt hair. She is skilled in archery and horseback riding; a young woman full of fire and spirit- she is also a Scottish princess, daughter of the bear-King Fergus (Billy Connolly) and Queen Eleanor (Emma Thompson). As a princess certain things are expected of her such as following the age-old tradition of betrothal. Merida feels hopeless in her situation and desperately seeks a way to change her mother's mind and ultimately to change her own fate. The feisty young princess gets what she asks for, but the transformation in her life isn't quite what she expected. The princess soon sees how hard it is to control a wild situation, just as her mother must have felt in trying to tame her daughter's wild spirit. Queen Eleanor in-turn experiences the great feeling of freedom and enjoys a time of wild abandon. In the end, the two find not only a deeper aspect of themselves but also a better understanding of each other, and with this new perspective they grow to love and respect one another, mending the bond that had been broken. Pixar has done it again with this exciting and humorous look into the not-so-traditional life of medieval Scottish nobility. The pressures and responsibilities of being royalty are captured by an endearing cast of characters; the three rambunctious little red-headed princes, the rebellious princess Merida, the fun loving King Fergus and the overbearing Queen Eleanor. Set in the beautiful Scottish countryside, the castle and forest are an enchanting setting for this magical family dramedy. As a whole ""Brave"" was a great movie and I highly recommend it for children and all families young at heart. You'll laugh a lot at the obvious fun as well as the hidden adult humor that Pixar is so great at incorporating into their films. You may even get a little teary-eyed in the end as the animated characters displayed very human emotions. Either way I'm sure you will leave the theater smiling and talking about this film for quite some time.",Brave

It takes place in a castle, and a forest that we see over and over again, and there's two bears. Bears. Why not a griffin? Centuar? Minotuar? Something cool and mythical? Oh well, dragons would've been great and that's been done to perfection already. This movie is a long way from that. An excellent animated movie will appeal to all ages and mean many different things to young and old. This one just falls flat.",Brave
496,brightteacher22,Wonderful! One of Disney Pixar's Best films!!,8,9 July 2012,"The character development in this film is very very advanced . I especially appreciated the sense of humor and brevity that was brought into many of the main characters. The main theme was related to coming of age which I feel a lot of people can relate to. I also enjoyed the movie's score. So great I didn't want the movie to end and was sad when it did. Almost brought me to tears at some points. It was not necessarily appropriate for a young child but perfect for a teen or adult. Teenage girls I feel could really relate to the main character. The cinematography in this film is out of this world, and I didn't see it in 3D.",Brave
497,isabelsong5000,"Different and New, But A GREAT Change!! (If this teenager can fall in love with this movie, so can you!)",9,13 July 2012,"Brave is completely different and new from other Disney movies, and I have to say I love the change! First of all, it's a whole different ethnicity and setting, which I LOVE to see! It doesn't have a princess falling in love for an average boy or vice versa, but it has a wonderful mother-daughter story line! This focuses more on family, being who you are, and accepting who others are. Disney has never really done anything like this, and I especially love the mother-daughter aspect. Have you ever noticed how in so many Disney movies, it has cheesy romance? Not that I'm complaining, I love cheesy romance, but it's never focused so much on family like Brave. There's never really been any strong mom characters, either, since in Disney movies usually the mom is a moot point- they're always absent from the story line in some way, whether they're dead or just not an important part of the story. But in Brave, Disney manages to do the whole deeper meaning thing with finding one's self, accepting others, and familial love, but also incorporates a strong, caring mother and daughter who find a way to reconnect and understand each other, which is something VERY important in today's society. In today's society, you always hear about teenagers and parents who don't get along, so coming from a teenager, I think it's ABSOLUTELY GREAT that Disney did a movie where the mother and daughter manage to sort their differences and accept one another. It's a welcome change, and it sends a strong message to little kids (and teenagers who, like me, LOVE Disney movies) that is important to receive in the world we live in today.Now, apart from the changes and differences, I have to say I loved pretty much everything about this movie. I especially loved the little brothers- they made my night. I think they're my new Maximus and Pascal. I loved how Merida was able to stop the betrothal and change tradition while still gaining understanding and a special bond with her mom, and that speech she gave to the clans. Though I'm pretty sure I already said this, I love how Merida and her mom came to understand and accept one another. I love Merida's father, especially when he pretends to be Merida for her mom. I love this movie, it made me laugh, and it successfully portrayed a deeper meaning of love and FAMILY that Disney has been missing all these years (I mean, they have touched on it and beat around the bush, but they've never really confronted it head on like this!(: It's great they finally have!).I love the movie, and I will definitely be watching this over and over again. Do I recommend it? YES!",Brave
498,grandpati,Pixar and Brave 2,7,14 July 2012,"As most critics have praised for ""another great Pixar movie"", I would like to say that this cartoon is without doubt one of the best cartoons of 2012, a valuable nominee for Oscar 2012. However, Brave is quite short and fast-paced, I'm sure the audience expected more from Brave. Let me explain. First, it is the bear-obsessed witch? Where does she come from? Why is she not obsessed with dragons or cats? Second, there should be more the tricks and treats from the triplet. Like the penguins in Madagascar series. Third, Pixar should have pictured a stronger antagonist For example, the battle between clans. Finally, this point makes me think that Pixar is saving the plot for Brave 2. It is the appearance of Merinda's counterpart. It could be a bolder princess or prince. Brave 2 next summer, definitely!",Brave
499,smithsoniansummer,Not the usual Pixar quality and lacking in plot originality,5,22 July 2012,"While the main character is certainly a refreshing change from the usual princess, Brave was not the awesome movie I was expecting. Might my expectations have been a little too high? Maybe so, but after seeing Pixar's past work, I was definitely expecting better. The characters, location, and the flaming red hair were all great. The only problem was one of the biggest mistakes you can make when writing a story: using an unoriginal story. It was predictable after a certain point in the movie, and I felt like I was watching a Disney channel episode because I thought to myself, ""Oh, obviously she's going to turn back into a human, and then they'll live happily ever after."" There weren't a lot of twists after the halfway mark, and I was shaking my head towards the end. People may love it, but I would have loved it a lot more if they had worked harder on the plot.",Brave

Like bows, wars, bears,princess and Celtic things but when i watch this movie it such a different ""Brave"" from what i thought. it's kinda ""brave"" to have freedoms or some kinds of... This plot is similar to ""Coraline"" and it can happen with any ordinary family of any period but since they put it on Scandinavian period people(at least me) get expect it must be more action and more fighting. Anyway it's another good movie to watch. There're beautiful scene, great animated, great sound and score. I can't believe this is not the main team from pixar. Really hope to see other works from this team again. Worth to watch on 3D and blueray also :)",Brave
501,pammerwammer,I would not recommend.,5,2 August 2012,"I took my kids to see Brave and wished I had gone myself. As I was not the only parent covering eyes and ears and leaving the theatre. I would not recommend this film to children under six. There was some parts that were very violent, very scary, and it was the first nudity in a Disney film that I myself have ever seen. I enjoyed this film, my little ones did not. I think Disney cut themselves short on this one as the story line was lacking. This film might have been better done as a real life version rather than cartoon? I guess I was expecting more. As a story idea I do think hers was great but needed more plot dimensions. More conflict. More unexpected twists. Maybe a reluctant prince too?",Brave

You will or did read many of review said this is a disappointed, stupid, miss led movie. I will tell you that it's those people that does not pay attention to the real meaning of this movie.""Brave"" does not mean just fighting monsters or risking your life. ""Brave"" mean doing something that require your courage and that is what had showed in Princess Merida. She bravely admit her mistakes and protect her family. You may ask then why they showed her skill in archery ? This is a mean to show the reason for the movie Another beautiful thing about this movie is it about family. I'm sure every single parents with a teenage or may be just a daughter are the ones understand this movie the most. From the beginning to the end of the movie The Queen always protects and cares for her daughter and these action are showed through an amazing plot that i can't describe without spoiling the movie.This is the movie that should be screened and made not stupid movie like ""Step Up"" series - promoting kids to ""break the rule"" - . Kids never understand what the adult did to protect them. When they're blaming their parents for not understand them, they never remember it was their parents that protected them, sacrifice for them when they were young.I'm highly recommend this movie for everyone. Specially kids; so you can be reminded of whom protected you.",Brave
503,ozzycat,When Disney Pixar becomes Disney... made by Pixar!,5,16 August 2012,"As you know, the great Pixar Studios were bought by the Disney company some years ago. Some of us were afraid that the films they delivered at the time, with their fresh atmosphere and independent story lines, would morph into 'common' Disney productions. Fortunately, it was not the case and they continued making great quality animated films which fitted perfectly with their time. Yes, Pixar Studios had succeeded in finding a new style of films that children and adults would enjoy together with different eyes and that were not bringing old fashioned tricks to the screen.BRAVE is what we feared at the time... A great animated film with that usual Disney touch. The film begins... Aaaaah! What another magnificent rendering of the world! Beautiful scenery, nice characters, great attention to details. In the first minutes, the only thing you see is Miranda's hair! What a perfect job! And it goes on for the rest: animals hairs, water effects, waving grass, etc. So close to visual perfection, far far away (hehe!) from anything Dreamworks brings us!!!Then comes the first totally unexpected thing in a Pixar film: a completely useless romantico-heroic song! What happened to the tasty independent Pixar side you could find some minutes before in the short movie ""La Luna""??? It seems that it has fade away... let's hope not for ever!The storyline in BRAVE is really predictable, the characters are a bit too silly, it's just another version of a Disney princess tale.So, if you want to spend a good time with children, this film is very good in its category. It's a nice Disney product, with everything that the genre should contain. Maybe a bit frightening in the end for the youngest... But definitely not what a Pixar enthusiast should expect (apart from the quality of the renderings)!!!Conclusion: - You like Disney: run and grab a ticket! - You like Pixar: wait for the Blu-Ray release...",Brave
504,tenstupids,Brave: Disney Mythology,9,27 August 2012,"Almost everything ticks the boxes with Brave. Storyline, sub plots, 'messages', action sequences, character development, comedy moments, pace, casting and I saw it in 3-D which was great. I particularly liked the motif of the next generation trying to struggle towards some sort of understanding with the last, a universal developmental issue. There was some nice 'magical' stuff, always a hit with kids.The thing I found disturbing was that while all the male characters are gnarled, quirky or downright ugly, the two main female characters are the usual Disney girls - flawless skin, soft melodic voices, perfect, gorgeous big Manga-style eyes, Barbie figures, great hair.As role models for little girls at a time when we are supposed to be celebrating diversity and building self esteem by not constantly obsessing about appearances, especially for women, the characters' physical perfection seemed to be completely over the top. I really liked the character of the rebellious Princess, who had developed male skills like archery, riding, etc and represented feminism pretty well, even thought we all know that a real Scottish mediaeval Princess would have had no power and fewer rights. I guess Disney has to make a 'pretty' movie to suit its market, but does the appearance of the girls really have to be SO shallow? Overall though, a great, touching movie, I took my 7 year old grandson, he engaged pretty well with it so it does the job.",Brave

Good movie for all ages. here is the plot: Princess Merida is tired of being a princess and her mums annoying rules. When she accidentally goes to a witch that sets a deadly curse on her mum she has to be 'brave' and undo the curse. it was a charming movie and teaches good values like on being brave. Although i LOVE this movie and don't think it is 10/10.the beginning was a little bit boring but i still loved the great techniques this movie used. worth watching!!! The animation in this movie is very good and the characters are very unusual and interesting. princess Merida is definitely the best character. worth watching!!,Brave
506,johnrockeston000111,Ecstatic film with a touch of love,10,29 November 2012,"Though a casual movie watcher can foretell the gist of the story as the movie progresses, and though we can see some resemblances within the incidents in the story with some movies or stories that are existing today or that we have heard elsewhere, what I would more like to tell is that even though such above cases appears so the movie itself stands in a quiet mesmerizing arena.The geographical representation of the platform where the movie comes to light is so picturesque and brilliantly composed. Characters are brought to life with a touch of complacency. Music composition is so elegant and suits to the theme of the movie very much. Even though those factors are the ones which the creators of the movie usually take care not to go wrong, however they all are intricately painted in a well sophisticated fashion.This movie is so emotionally entailed since due to the vivid representation how a young willful princess who tries to heal her mother from a curse that she unlooked-for. Though a usual movie watcher can see that as a déjà vu, if we watch this movie from the mind of a young child we can see how cohesive the movie is. For me this movie is overwhelming and remarkable, and also brought a tear to my eye. Being this movie an animation the creators have succeeded in representing a typical intimate bond between a mother and a child in an epical way with a touch of love, affection and caring. Even though I have seen or heard such similar stories resembling to the storyline of Brave it does not necessarily mean to me that it should be the end of such sort of stories depicting the maternal bond of a mother and a child. As a matter of fact there should be more movies as this one.This movie is more suitable for children. But I hope adults too can find it adsorbing if they can be in a mind of a child for nearly one and a half hours throughout the movie. By staying so I hope you can get your version of ""Brave"" as you can see. But for me this is my version of ""Brave"".",Brave

510,olsonj0411,"Good, but not up to usual Disney standard",6,1 December 2012,"Brave is an interesting movie, but after seeing other Disney films, I had higher expectations. The plot is very simplistic and predictable. Kids will still love it, but it will not be as fun for adults. Let's compare this movie to Tangled, which is a masterpiece -- complicated plot lines and breathtaking plot twists, right up to the very end. Tangled also has incredible characters that add so much to the story and watchability (that horse!), making it a movie you want to see again and again. Brave is visually stunning, but the overall story is just so-so -- too predictable. I've read so many reviews of this movie that focus on Merida's hair and how amazing it looked -- you know you have a weak story if all everyone talks about is the girl's hair! (Which I do agree was amazing.) Elements I liked: Merida, the princess, is very strong, smart, capable, and independent - a fantastic role model for little girls. I love that Disney is continuing to bring strong girls into the role of princess. I also love that this story was not ultimately about being rescued by a prince or finding Mr. Right. Elements I did not like: Merida's father, the king, is depicted as a strong warrior who will face down a huge bear without fear, but is a joke as a leader -- his wife, the queen, constantly has to do his speaking for him and direct him, making him look weak, treating him almost like a child. The queen is a very strong woman, but why does the king have to be depicted as a weak leader by comparison? Can't there be a strong queen AND a strong king who knows how to lead and speak for himself? It's as if the writers wanted to emphasize the queen's strength by making the king look like a buffoon, which I don't think is necessary. I also thought the silent little brothers were weird. Clearly, the writers were trying to introduce some comic relief and some interest for boys watching this movie, but it was strange that they never spoke -- they were truly little imps. Bottom line: your kids will enjoy this movie, it's a very nice story and visually stunning, but don't expect to be blown away.",Brave
511,natedawg1986,Brave in a nutshell,8,2 December 2012,"The film Brave is definitely a must see in my opinion. It has plenty of ""chuckle"" heartwarmingly funny moments, as well as some innocently ""vulgur"" humor, though these so-called vulgar moments don't compromise the PG rating in anyway. At points, the film has some VERY emotional moments, which I'm not afraid to admit, made me shed a few tears, And if your curious, Im 26 years old, and a man. Yeah, it was that heart wrenching... The depth, charisma, and intricacies of the voice acting alone places this among the greatest that Disney has presented in the past. Above all however, was the animation. This is somewhat personal (because I find red haired woman breath-taking), but the animated facial expressions, timing, detail, texture, and the contrast was the icing, cherry, and hot fudge on the ""cake"". Also, pardon my spelling errors please...",Brave
512,neelmehta96,"Complex, thought-provoking masterpiece",10,27 December 2012,"I've watched every Pixar movie and have loved their messages, but Pixar has really outdone itself this time with this brilliantly complex movie. Its message - only by being different can you change your life - really touched me. But beyond that, it's up to interpretation, unlike the rest of the straightforward Pixar movies, and it forces you to think about who you really are. You're forced to question authority and rebellion, free will and destiny, heroism and cowardice. I've seen it so many times and gotten a different read about humanity each time.I love the character of Princess Merida - perhaps the most-developed character Pixar has put out since Woody. She's a great role model, not afraid to stand up for herself and defy custom in such a traditional era. In just 93 minutes, Pixar develops a complex, admirable character full of spunk, spirit, and intelligence. She has to be my favorite movie character of all time.Brave is full of adventure and comedy, sure, but it's more than just a children's movie. It speaks to me and provokes thoughts that even classic books cannot, and for that it takes its place as my favorite movie of all time.",Brave
513,ma-edstrm,refreshingly absent of the handsome prince charming.,9,11 January 2021,"It's a princess movie, but not as we got to know them. This movie is unlike any other movie about a princess, made by Disney. I hate, and I mean hate, princess movies where the protagonist in some way (ie the princess) appears as a helpless victim and the one who is to save the day is a prince. The antagonist is 9 times out of 10 a flat character; a wicked woman who is easily killed (without us understanding why she came to be evil) and the blue-eyed, singing princess, always happy, always at ease, celebrating a wedding with a man she does not even know.This film differs on a number of levels: 1. It is a story about a daughter and a mother. 2. The daughter and the mother have their own wills, their own temperament. 3. Not everything depends on what male side characters do, the story mainly depend on the mother and daughter. 4. The whole story is that she gets a CHOICE and she CHOOSES NOT to get married. That is, to break with unhealthy traditions. 5. She is not servile and submissive in ANY WAY. 6. The female protagonists are given space in a way that few other films allow for. This is a film about disagreement and misunderstanding of the other's will, but also about forgiveness and understanding and love between a family. In other words, this is a film that differs greatly between ex Tangled, Snow White, Sleeping Beauty, Cinderella, Little Mermaid and all the other generic singing girls that are pumped out even today. It's a refreshing film that I wish I had as a role model when I was little. To learn to listen, take responsibility for one's actions, but still be free to do anything other than stand on the sidelines and hope for the best, with an eternal smile wrapped in total helplessness. For who needs choice or even a personality when one has a song and a prince? How Frost, which is such an incredibly much worse role model in comparison (although it also has a certain degree of freedom in the equation) received much higher rating is regrettable. I get angry reading comments that the girl and the mother are behaving ""badly"". If anything, they show human behavior, a true picture of how women also have will and drive and last but not least; a personality and love for each other, rather than an figment of the imagination.",Brave

I think not!,2,24 February 2013,"I have just learned that the Oscar gave them the Best Animated Feature at the 85th annual Academy Awards, and I must say that this fact has left me dubious of the award's credibility. I don't understand what exactly was so ""Brave"" about Merida in this film. She is focused on only herself throughout the story. ""It's not my fault that mother turned into a bear!"" ""Oh my silly brothers turning into bears as well!"" - all this is the result of her selfishness. She is not apologetic to her poor mother at all, and all she does throughout the film is to complain and whine while scurrying around, trying to make things back in place. When her father the King, unknowing of the truth, tries to kill her mother, Merida suddenly turns into a self-proclaimed heroine by telling him that she ""won't allow him to kill my mother!"". There is no depth nor growth in Merida till the very end, as she continues to focus her abilities in getting her way. Also, regarding the artwork, there is too much focus on Merida's hair. Her hair bouncing about while she is riding the horse. Her hair blowing in the wind. Yes I admit, the technique is spectacular, but with such a shallow and petty story, one can't help but wonder if Disney couldn't have focused more on the story rather than the silly bouncy hair. On the whole, a disappointment.",Brave

I didn't see it at the cinema and decided when I saw the title in my local supermarket to add it to my shopping cart. I watched it straight away and was hooked. The one liners like you find in most films like it are hilarious. Which most young kids wouldn't pick up on and the underlying themes are amazing. The whole idea of a a young persons rebellion against their parents is a common theme in films. However unlike some of the thin plotted movies from Disney in cartoon form the guys at Pixar have it down to a T. they can make a good action packed animation and still make it for all the family. I loved WallI and Ice Age, and now this is another light hearted movie to add to my collection of all time favorites. I hope they do a second one however I don't know what they could make the story out of.I would definitely recommend this movie to all the family. Or to change a boring Saturday night in.",Brave
516,Bucky_2007,A Great Mother/Daughter film,7,20 June 2013,"Animation: 8/10 The animation is amazing (equal to the quality in UP I would say). The animation really excels when showing the Scottish landscape as well as Merida's hair. The only sad part is that after the opening first act you don't see too many larger scenes of the landscape.Voice Acting: 10/10 This is where the film is absolutely perfect, some people have been complaining they had difficulty watching since everyone in the film have such thick Scottish accents but it brings a lot of originality to the film and helps bring more personality to all the characters. The accents (though Scottish) are similar to How to Train your Dragon, if those accents bothered you the ones in this film probably will as well.Score: 7/10 Fits perfectly with the film. The score was done by Patrick Doyle using bagpipes, single flutes and other Scottish instruments adapting traditional Scottish jigs and Gaelic psalms. The result is a score with an authentic Scottish feel as well as sounding surprisingly modern.Story: 5/10 Unfortunately this is were the film starts to fall apart, the characters are really fantastic, and this film is very much a character story, but the actual plot surrounding those characters is mediocre at best. The first act in the film, which sets up the characters and background, is perfect in every way, and I mean perfect. Unfortunately once the plot gets going into the second and third act the film becomes increasingly average.Still it is a great film centering on a real mother daughter kind of relationship, and the character of Merida herself is a great role model for kids, she is far from the perfect stylized princesses with an adult personality that have traditionally been used. This princess is a real girl imperfect with a genuine childlike and spontaneous personality. Conclusion: 7/10 This is a great film about a mother and daughter both needing to listen to one another, they learn to recognize their own flaws, listen to what the other wants, and see the world through the others point of view. If you're looking for an animated mother/daughter film or a good young female role model then this is the best film out there.side note: A lot of younger kids have found the bear Mordu in the film too scary, google a picture of Mordu before you watch it, he really is surprisingly frightening for a children's film.",Brave

Just because of their look and their dialogues. The story was OK, but not new. It's kind a like the same at the moment. Young girl or also a boy has to be something that his parents want him to be.

521,UsaChanMan,Boring,3,3 July 2016,"I originally was put off watching this film because right from the trailer, I thought it looked boring but today I decided to watch it because I was bored and couldn't think of anything else to watch. Anyway, I ended up watching the whole movie, I decided maybe I would be surprised since it is Pixar but no, it was much worse than I had perceived it to be. First, without going into plot or characters, I thought the music choices were terrible, didn't really give a vibe to the time period or give dimension. The characters didn't have much development, like Merida didn't really change, maybe matured a little bit but I don't feel this film had any real hurdles or consequences. The mother was too typical and ""saw the light"" too typically too, the bear plot just seemed random and stupid. The father was typical and bland, his hate for bears was like the father who hated dragons in How to Train Your Dragon (which now also reminds me a lot of this, the male character not acting how he's meant to etc.). The father stayed the same. The triplets had no reason to be there. Her suitors had no real personalities, we didn't really see much about them and they were all typical. Story has been done many times and if I recall that TV show about the red head (hair was also curly) who lived in a castle who wanted to be a knight (Jane and the Dragon), I thought it would be more like that but it seemed the writers wanted to chuck in Brother Bear to spice things up. I also get that Pixar likes to cater to children and adults but I thought some of the jokes were a bit too crude for a children's film or made too obvious. So bland Pixar, I can't believe it took multiple writers and multiple rewrites to come up with this dribble.",Brave

It also shows that making mistakes isn't the end of the world, it's never too late to change the future. Overall Brave aimed more on young audiences which tells them that the love of family is much more important than love relationships.",Brave

525,hk-02902,"How is this movie ""inspirational""?",2,17 June 2016,"I watched the movie hoping it would be ""inspirational"" about gender roles, as the media claimed it was. Merida was supposed to be brave and independent as a heroine, so I was really excited when I finally got the chance to watch the film. Turns out, half of the film was dedicated to Merida whining about her mother and how she's so unhappy with being a princess. She even curses her mother, for heaven's sake. How the hell is this supposed to be inspirational? Because of the shock, that's the only element of the film that I remember the most. Yes, the punishment was that her mother turned into a bear, but the rest of the story turned to Merida rescuing her mother from the curse. Supposedly this film was supposed to represent feminism and inspire girls to choose their own paths, but all I took away from this film was that children should obey their parents. Sorry Brave fans, but Brave was a huge disappointment and Merida doesn't represent feminism in any way...Wait so what path did Merida take again? This wasn't even clear. And I can't even call her a heroine. She only seems like an ungrateful child who needs to learn how to obey her parents and if she is so unsatisfied with her life, she doesn't have to curse her own mother like that. All in all, Brave has the worst storyline compared to other Pixar and even Disney princess films.",Brave
526,ememcsweeney,Compelled to provide support,10,30 August 2018,"This is actually my first review ever on IMDb and I felt compelled to write it against the massive backlash this film seemed to get.Those people who claim the story is too cliche or the plot is too thin, the story itself is an appropriated Scottish folklore legend. I grew up with this story and I think Disney/Pixar have masterfully brought it to life.Those saying Merida is spoilt and selfish, she is only a teenager?! The whole point of this film is to show the growth of understanding between her and her mother. Neither of them are capable of listening to the other and the whole narrative is how they grow together.The animation is beautiful and the music is incredible. There is nothing to fault about this movie.",Brave
527,burristhewerd,Profoundly devoid of meaning.,2,6 January 2018,"All I can say without spoiling the plot is, if you think this movie is an inspiring story of one little girl heeding the call to fulfill her true destiny, think again. That appears to essentially be what the writers intended it to be, but formulated in such a way to make me want to vomit at almost every point of the movie. Thought this would be on par with Moana given the plot description, but I was wrong... 2 stars for the occasional chuckle at the king's antics.",Brave
