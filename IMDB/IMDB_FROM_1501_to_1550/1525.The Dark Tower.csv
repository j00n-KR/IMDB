0,TheLittleSongbird,The not so Dark Tower,5,21 August 2017,"Stephen King is notoriously difficult to adapt, some of his work near-unfilmable or at least with parts that are (i.e. 'IT'). Which is why film/television adaptations are such a mixed bag.Made up of eight books, 'The Dark Tower' book series is simply spectacular, with wildly entertaining and imaginative stories, a deft mix of genres, unparalleled attention to detail and conflict and with characters that are far more than standard clichés. Hearing that there was going to be a film, part of me was a little excited but there was even more apprehension considering the scale and length of the series on the whole. Also because of the reception the film received, being critically panned but the audience reaction being much more mixed.After seeing it, 'The Dark Tower' to me wasn't as bad as reputed to be and could have been far worse. The complaints however are understandable and valid, contrary to what those vehemently and in some cases condescendingly say those who found problems with the film do know what they're talking about. There are merits with 'The Dark Tower', but it has a lot of problems that cannot be ignored, no matter how hard people try. Considering the track record for Stephen King adaptations, it was useless expecting a straight up adaptation on my part and the film was seen with no aim to compare the different mediums and instead judge it on its own.There are much better adaptations of King's work, especially 'The Shawshank Redemption', 'Stand By Me', 'Misery', 'Dolores Claiborne', 'Carrie' (1976), 'Salem's Lot', 'The Shining' (Kubrick) and 'The Green Mile'. There are also far worse, such as 'Children of the Corn' (2009), 'Sleepwalkers', 'Tommyknockers', 'Thinner', 'Dreamcatcher' and 'The Langoliers' (of the ones seen, there's some to go yet). 'The Dark Tower' is towards the weaker end though. As an adaptation, it's pretty much an abortion, asking for a straight up faithful adaptation of one book was a big ask but this feels like a severely truncated cliff-notes version of one book with fleeting references to the others.This did affect the pacing and storytelling of the film, and reinforced the notion in my mind that the books are better adapted as a series of at least two hour films or a series of mini-series. One film of just over 90 minutes, whether in comparison to the books or on its own, just doesn't cut it.It's not an irredeemable film by all means. The acting was the best asset, with a calmly stoic, gravitas-filled and the personification of authoritative dignity Idris Elba particularly acquitting himself well. Tom Taylor is also credible, instead of bland or annoying or both he holds his own. While views on Matthew McConaughey's villain were more mixed, McConaughey to me had a few uneven moments where he was too smug (blame the writing more than him though) but mostly he was suitably sinister.For a limited budget, 'The Dark Tower' could have looked worse. Not everything visually works, but it's skilfully photographed, atmospherically lit and has some quite authentic production design. The action is choreographed reasonably well and has suspense, excitement and tension. The music has some haunting moments and positively pulsates.However, 'The Dark Tower' is far too short and feels very rushed as a result of cramming in a lot. The film does try to do too much and doesn't have the length to do much with any of it, which makes a lot of elements underwritten and without much impact. Only in the action does the film excite or nail-bites, the script is far too watered down, cliché ridden and half-baked to make the exposition scenes work and characterisation is severely wanting despite the valiant efforts of the cast.Not everything works visually. Some of the editing is sloppy and the visual effects look like they were made last minute and with the worst of budget limitations. The direction shows unease with the material, while the story is choppy and the ending rushed and anti-climactic. Pacing is erratic, the exposition is clunky and very draggy while the final third is over-stuffed and was in need of slowing down.In summation, could have been far worse and it is watchable but as an adaptation it's a disaster and judging it on its own terms sees just as many problems. Even when one is trying not to compare, which this review really tried not to and only mentioned how it fared as an adaptation in half a paragraph or something, 'The Dark Tower' is very problematic on its own.Oh and, despite being a subjective person, don't let those defending the film make you feel like it's illegal to dislike the film and have problems with it, this whole agenda-against-critics has become out of control and uncalled for. If one likes the film fine but learn the difference between fact and opinions and be mature. 5/10 Bethany Cox",The Dark Tower
1,Leofwine_draca,Should be better,4,5 July 2019,"THE DARK TOWER, the ambitious movie version of Stephen King's sprawling, multi-volume fantasy saga, was a notoriously a huge flop on release and watching it now you can see why. Gone is the dark nihilism of the stories to be replaced by a young adult-style adventure, packed with action and effects and very little in the way of depth or freshness. The CGI action spectacle becomes tiresome before long, as it always does, and the actors seem to be going through the motions rather than doing anything interesting. Matthew McConaughey is on autopilot in particular, while Idris Elba has surprisingly little screen time and his natural charisma is underutilised. This is far from the worst film I've seen - and it's not even the worst Stephen King film I've seen - but it should be a lot better.",The Dark Tower
2,SnoopyStyle,lifeless one and done,5,29 November 2017,"Jake Chambers is a troubled boy in NYC. He's haunted by nightmares and the city is rocked by earthquakes. His visions are of the fearsome Man in Black (Matthew McConaughey) and the mysterious last Gunslinger (Idris Elba). After a fight at school, his mother reluctantly calls a facility to the delight of his stepfather. He recognizes the two facility workers as fake-skins from his drawings. He runaways and gets transported through an abandoned portal to Mid-World. A tower at the center of the universe protects every world from the dark forces outside. The Man in Black called Walter with his fake-skin minions intends to use kidnapped children to bring down the tower.It's been decades since I read the books and I'm not sure if I read them all. The most memorable aspect of the books are the Lobstrosities and I doubt those creatures in the amusement park are them. It's all fine. I don't need them. I do need charismatic characters in a compelling story. The story is relatively bland after getting stripped down from the novels. The characters are even more bland. Both McConaughey and Elba are playing it reserved. It's not wrong but the movie struggles with their blandness. The kid isn't much better although he starts off well. The first act on earth is fine but it doesn't explain the abandoned house. It's just there with the portal and things happen. More things happen and then even more things happen until I stop caring. The sad part is that I don't think anybody on the film set cared either.",The Dark Tower
3,Prismark10,Lacklustre,4,29 April 2018,"The Dark Tower is an adaptation of a series of Stephen King Fantasy novels but it has not translated well on screen.Jake (Tom Taylor) is a young boy who is having strange dreams and visions of another world and other worldly figures which he draws. His behaviour is concerning her mother but soon Jake is pulled to another world via a portal.His presence arouses the interest of Walter, the Man in Black (Matthew McConaughey) who wants to get hold of him. Roland, also known as The Gunslinger (Idris Elba) is the last of his kind. Roland has lost everyone close to him in his battles with the Man in Black and prevent him from toppling the Dark Tower.The blame must go to director Nikolaj Arcel for this anemic, inert and listless film which shows signs of post production issues as indicated by its short running time.",The Dark Tower
4,claudio_carvalho,Watchable and Forgettable,6,16 October 2017,"In New York, the boy Jake Chambers (Tom Taylor) has nightmares with a Man in Black (Matthew McConaughey) that tries to destroy a tower using the children minds and a Gunslinger (Idris Elba) that tries to stop him. Jake likes to draw his nightmares and his mother Laurie (Katheryn Winnick) and his stepfather Lon (Nicholas Pauling) believe that Jake has psychological problems due to the loss of his beloved father. Jake finds that there are monsters wearing a human mask in New York and when Laurie and Lon decide to send Jake to an institution for rehabilitation, he notes that the man and the woman that has come to drive him to the institution are wearing skin masks and he flees. Using his drawing, he locates the house of his nightmares, He discovers a portal to a place called Mid-World inside the house. He stumbles upon the Gunslinger Roland that explains that the universe is supported by the tower and the Man in Black wants to fall it down to unleash monsters from other dimension to the universe. Further, Jake has powerful psychic powers capable to destroy the tower. Now the last hope of Earth and the universe is Gunslinger that is protecting Jake. ""The Dark Tower"" is a watchable but forgettable adventure with a story that gives the sensation that was made in a hurry and something is missing despite the cast and the good CGI. One of the greatest attraction is Katheryn ""Lagherta"" Winnick, but her participation is almost a cameo with a minor role. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""A Torre Negra"" (""The Black Tower"")",The Dark Tower
5,nogodnomasters,Death always wins,4,21 August 2017,"The premise of the film is there is a dark tower at the center of the universe. It keeps out ""the darkness"" from outside of the universe which consists of demons and earthquakes and I am not sure what else. Now the mind of a child...certain children can bring down the tower with a machine. Now who would want to do that? It seems the Man in Black (Matthew McConaughey)...you can call me Walter wants it down to bring about the end of the universe which seems counter productive even for evil.We find out that Jake (Tom Taylor) has visions of this whole thing and his mom thinks he is disturbed over the death of his father. But we imagine he will save the universe because he has ""The Shine"" not to be confused with ""The Shining"" which would get them sued. Jake hooks up with Roland (Idris Elba a gun slinger who is not a gun slinger...go figure.Tom Taylor was not convincing in his role. The dialogue consisted of some odd lines about not killing with your hand, killing with your heart, and forgetting the face of your father...which is apparently a bad thing no matter how ugly or cruel he might be, unless they are talking about a spiritual father, who knows. The production attempts to combine science with theology and does so in a way that insults both scientists and theologians except for those that might endorse bad ideas like ""The Omega Point."" Walter had telekinetic power and can cause people to hate and die at will. I wasn't sure why he needed machines to travel anywhere or to bring down the tower or to measure ""shine"" reminding me of when Captain Kirk said, 'Excuse me, but why does God need a starship?""....just because I guess. BTW there is nothing outside of the universe. That frame of reference does not exist. There is no ""outside of the universe"" no matter how many times theologians claims God is there.Film is aimed at a tween audience. No swearing sex, or nudity. Good for kids who like science fiction. As for me, I had to laugh at the constant face of your father line.",The Dark Tower
6,kosmasp,Read the book(s),5,8 November 2020,"I know some will already roll their eyes. It's easier to watch a movie - though I reckon there should be an audio version of the books, so you know ... and I don't judge you! Thinking about doing a few books that way myself. But back to the Dark Tower, which allegedly had a lot of production issues. Whether that is true or not, the movie (which is way too short considering, but feels almost too long in a different sense) never reaches the height of the series this is based on.It was a nice touch to see Idris Elba being cast as the good guy (gunslinger) and the effects in this are quite amazing. But there are so many changes to the book, that ... I mean I get it. Anyone who has read the books (and I'm still short the last two books) knows how tough to realize they are. Also maybe you feel that especially the first Dark Tower book, was quite the heavy read ... to put it mildly. So the movie tries its best to get many things from many different books ... also changing things along the way (no pun intended), but it never is really gripping. If you've not read the book(s), you may feel the need to add one extra point .. I would totally understand that .. if you've read them all, you probably would substract some though ... tough call ... and yours to make",The Dark Tower
7,classicsoncall,"""The power of your mind, that's what they want.""",7,15 February 2018,"Knowing full well that an hour and a half movie couldn't do justice to the series of novels by Stephen King, I was surprised that the film makers even attempted something like this. I've only read the first book in the series myself, and it seems there's enough material there for a two or three hour movie all by itself. Keeping an open mind however, I delved into this story because King is a personal reading favorite, even though the films based on his works have been a hit or miss affair.I can't really say this was a bad film per se. What I like about King is the word play he uses to come up with things that have a similarity to what already exists, like the idea of a 'beamquake' and a portal between Mid-World and Keystone Earth. This story also borrowed elements from the legend of King Arthur, as Roland's (Idris Elba) guns were forged from the steel of Arthur Eld's sword, better known in literature as Excalibur. So all of that stuff works for me. The portrayals of their characters by Elba and Matthew McConaughey were also competently done. In particular, I like the way McConaughey carried himself as a villain. When he told Jake's (Tom Taylor) stepdad Lon (Nicholas Pauling) 'Don't breathe', it was a much more effective way of killing him than using a weapon, and served to demonstrate Walter's magical powers. There comes a point though when all of that power gets inconsistently turned on it's head. It seemed almost too easy in retrospect the way Roland eventually defeated Walter/The Man in Black just by shooting him with some well placed bullets that couldn't be stopped using Walter's powers. Can't really have it both ways is what I'm trying to say.If you've read enough Stephen King, you'll be able to tell he grew up on classic TV and movie Westerns. In his book 'The Regulators', he makes mention of Rory Calhoun a couple of times, the star of TV's 'The Texan'. Similarly, I'd bet that King got his inspiration for the Gunslinger's Creed from one of television's first Western heroes, the masked man who lived by The Lone Ranger's Creed. So as a fan myself, I love those hints of nostalgia in King's work, and seeing how it's incorporated into these adapted screenplays is a real treat for me.",The Dark Tower

9,paul_haakonsen,"It could have, and should have, been so much more...",6,18 June 2018,"Granted, I have not read the books from Stephen King, but I am familiar with them as I used to work in a bookstore. I was looking forward to watching the adaptation of the novels here, and was expecting quite the unique experience.""The Dark Tower"" had a good story, albeit somewhat shallow in comparison to what I have heard about the novels from friends who read them.They had a good cast, whom did indeed put on great acting performances in bringing out their characters on the screen.One of the major things that kept ""The Dark Tower"" afloat for me was some really nice CGI and special effects throughout the entire movie.Wonderful connection to ""IT"" (Pennywise) and good tie-in with The Shine ability from ""The Shining"", if you are familiar with those from other works of Stephen King.All in all, then ""The Dark Tower"" was a tad above mediocre end result that could have been so much more. It just felt shallow and superficial, and it was definitely like they were in a rush to get through it. Which was a real shame, because it was painstakingly obvious throughout the entire movie, and it definitely served as an anchor holding it back.",The Dark Tower
10,Hey_Sweden,Routine treatment of a popular Stephen King property.,6,27 August 2018,"Idris Elba plays the role of Roland Deschain, the fabled last of the Gunfighters, in this condensing of the material from several epic Stephen King novels. Roland exists in an alternate world, and it is from this world, our own, and others, that enigmatic villain Walter / The Man in Black (Matthew McConaughey) nabs children. His hope is that he will a find a special child with a mind so powerful that it will lead to the destruction of the legendary Dark Tower, which protects the universe from outside forces. Into Rolands' world comes an imperilled kid, Jake (Tom Taylor), who is just the latest one to be singled out by Walters' minions.If nothing else, this passably engrossing cheesy action film has motivated this viewer to start checking out the King stories. Surely they must carry more weight than this feature, which barely scratches the surface in terms of creating worlds & characters. At first, this viewer didn't mind the fact that the run time was relatively brief (95 minutes), but now he can see that there IS more that can be done with this material. The super-duper visual effects do create some sense of magic, but not enough awe or wonder. Roland is a fairly interesting character who does get to do some badass things, but he and others are never fleshed out to any great extent.Elba is an actor of solid screen presence, but he is ultimately outshone by McConaughey, who delivers a carefully controlled and consistently amusing performance as an extremely vile bad guy. He's so powerful he can make people drop dead by simply saying, ""stop breathing"". And he racks up a decent body count as he does what he has to do, to obtain his quarry. Dennis Haysbert is thoroughly wasted in a brief cameo as Rolands' father Steven. Jackie Earle Haley has little to do as a thuggish associate of the villain; Katheryn Winnick is very easy on the eyes as Jakes' concerned mother.McConaughey basically makes it worth watching, although many accounts would indicate that this workmanlike but forgettable adaptation does King no real favours.Six out of 10.",The Dark Tower
11,CinemaSerf,Harry Potter meets Clint Eastwood!,5,23 October 2020,"What a pity! This is a good, solid Stephen King story that this film - despite two potentially strong lead actors - simply fails to ignite. To be fair to the young hero ""Jake"" (Tom Taylor), he tries quite hard as the youngster troubled by vivid and terrifying dreams of a tower and a mysterious man in black, but once we get past the establishing psycho-babble, the adventure story featuring Matthew McConaughey (""Walter"") and Idris Elba (""Roland"") relies too heavily on some mediocre special effects and some even worse dialogue. There is practically no menace or even the mildest of threat, and all too often it sort of hovers in the realms of a fantasy western lacking in jeopardy and style. I suspect Taylor has more to give, and we know the other principals do - but this is just an unmemorable film for the telly at Christmas.",The Dark Tower
12,zardoz-13,Uninspired Adaptation of King's Masterpiece,1,13 August 2017,"I've read some of Stephen King's novels, and--with a few exceptions--I've seen most of the movies inspired by his novels. Although he has never been one of my favorite authors, I've enjoyed reading some of his work. Predictably, the novels surpass the movies. Nevertheless, I loved the two ""Carrie"" adaptations. The 2013 remake with Chloë Grace Moretz topped the 1976 original with Sissy Spacek and John Travolta. ""The Shining"" was a memorable novel, but the absence of CGI when it was produced in 1980 prompted director Stanley Kubrick to take liberties with the story. Jack Nicholson saved the movie. ""The Green Mile"" (1999) with Tom Hanks didn't impress me, while ""The Shawshank Redemption"" (1994) ranked as the best King adaptation. ""Dolores Claiborne"" (1995), ""The Running Man"" (1987), ""The Dead Zone"" (1983), ""Stand by Me"" (1986), ""Apt Pupil"" (1998), and ""Christine"" (1983) all qualified as above-average. The ending ruined ""The Mist"" (2007). Stuff like ""Silver Bullet"" (1985), the two ""Creepshow"" movies, ""Maximum Overdrive"" (1986), ""Thinner"" (1996), and ""The Lawnmower Man"" (1992) and its sequel were potboilers. After watching what ""Island of Lost Souls"" director Nikolaj Arcel and ""Fifth Wave"" co-screenwriters Akiva Goldsman and Jeff Pinker, and Anders Thomas Jensen of ""The Duchess,"" did to King's ""The Dark Tower,"" you have to wonder what were they thinking when they tampered with his bestseller. Danish, art-house helmer Nikolaj looks clearly out of his element, and Goldsman, Pinker, and Jensen should have confined themselves strictly to the material in King's novel. Hopelessly incomprehensible, thoroughly enigmatic, and predictably formulaic, this dire adaptation of King's magnum opus ""The Dark Tower"" displays little fidelity to the novel. Pitting ""Luther"" star Idris Elba as the heroic Gunslinger, Roland Deschain, against Oscar-winner Matthew McConaughey as the evil Sorcerer, a.k.a. Walter Padick, 'the Man in Black,' the film struggles to generate any excitement and suspense. Despite his ambivalence about the film, Stephen King has said, ""'This is not exactly my novel but this is very much the spirit and the tone and I'm very happy.' Mind you, the performances are all beyond reproach. Stephen King enthusiasts may appreciate this version more than anybody who have neither perused King nor the eight novels comprising ""The Dark Tower"" series. Curiously, I read the first novel in the franchise about The Gunslinger, and ""The Dark Tower"" contains only a microscopic amount of the book. ""The Dark Tower"" filmmakers have omitted more than half of the novel as well as eliminated some of its more sensational scenes. Reportedly, they have inserted material from later books in the series, but they have neglected to account for many details that must have been left on the editing room floor. Jake Chambers (newcomer Tom Taylor) is a vividly imaginative, 14-year old lad, with a psychic gift that enables him to 'shine.' Basically, Jake can read minds and conduct mental conversations with others who share his ability. The allusion to Stephen King's earlier epic ""The Shining"" is unmistakable. Jake's sympathetic mother Laurie (Katheryn Winnick of ""Cloud 9"") and his abrasive stepfather Lon (Nicholas Pauling of ""Doomsday"") are anxious about their troubled son. Jake misses his biological father, an NYC firefighter who died in a conflagration, and he resents his stepdad. He gets into a fight with another student at his New York City school over his apocalyptic drawings. Laurie and Lon convince him to spend a weekend in psychiatric facility. Jake suspects that the people who have come to take him are sinister, shape-shifting aliens, and he flees. Walter, a.k.a. 'the Man in Black' (Matthew McConaughey of ""Interstellar"") surprises Jake's parents after the youth eludes his envoys. Walter orders Lon to ""stop breathing,"" and Lon keels over stone cold dead on the floor. Walter enters Jake's room. He projects himself into the past and scrutinizes those ominous drawings that plaster one wall of Jake's room. Pictures of a dark tower, a gunslinger, and a sorcerer recur in Jake's sketches. Afterward, 'the Man in Black' incinerates Laurie on the spot without a qualm. Meantime, Jake finds a house in the city that contains a portal between the Earth and the post-apocalyptic world called Mid-World. Mid-World resembles a parched, desolate wasteland inhabited by woebegone people. Jake befriends the last living Gunslinger, Roland Deschain (Idris Elba of ""Pacific Rim""), and explains that Walter has been abducting children, torturing them, and using their minds to demolish the Dark Tower. The Dark Tower is a soaring spire, sort of a primeval Empire State Building, that looms at the center of the universe and preserves the balance between Good and Evil. Walter,' the Man in Black,' longs to destroy the Dark Tower. Moreover, he believes Jake is the best candidate to topple the iconic structure. Roland has been pursuing 'the Man in Black' to exact vengeance because Walter killed his father, Steven Deschain (Dennis Haysbert of ""Waiting to Exhale""), who taught Roland how to handle those six-shot revolvers. Miraculously, Walter has survived many attempts on his life by Roland. Essentially, Roland blasts away at him, but Walter snatches the bullets harmlessly out of the air before any can strike him.Clocking in at 95 spartan minutes, ""The Dark Tower"" is boilerplate Stephen King. Unfortunately, the filmmakers reveal little about Mid-World, the portals connecting it with Earth, and most of all the background of the mysterious Dark Tower. The filmmakers in ""The Dark Tower"" seem to parcel out only bread crumbs of information, while they have glossed over the ground rules dictating behavior so as not to interfere with Roland's single-minded, vengeance-driven pursuit of 'the Man in Black.' Inexplicably, Roland can reload his Remington revolvers with incredible speed, and he doesn't have to shuck the cartridges physically from the loops in his gun belt to achieve this feat! We never learn what makes the minds of children so toxic to the tower. Ultimately, ""The Dark Tower"" qualifies as a formulaic sci-fi,fantasy-Western-horror epic that should have retained more elements of King's original story.",The Dark Tower

Maybe the theater ambiance got to me or maybe one good scene stuck with me so I rate the entire movie based upon that. I can still say that this movie is good. Idris Elba as the Gunslinger and Matthew McConaughey as the antagonist, Walter, were great. Their performances were right on point. They didn't do too much nor too little.The story was also good. This movie was based upon a Stephen King novel of the same title and King rarely swings and misses. The base premise was that of good versus evil. More specifically it was about the demon world seeking entry into the human world and the coalition of gunslinger, seer, and shiner attempting to prevent it.There was some good action in a measured amount. Likewise, there was a small dose of comedic scenes to provide levity as there were the heavy scenes that caused the heart to pound.

He makes his way into this other world and becomes part of that conflict.There was this bloke who wanted to build a mansion. He had the plans and they were wonderful. But the planning authority kept messing about for years over the exact plans and all the permissions he needed, plus he couldn't borrow the money he needed. It dragged on and on until he eventually succeeded in building his mansion.Well, I say ""mansion"" - it's more a tent. It's a very nice tent, though.Meet the Dark Tower movie.Stephen King's 7 volume (with extras) magnum opus is condensed into a 95 minute movie. That means that all the texture and subtlety is discarded along with half the key characters, and the story is rewritten (Akiva bl**dy Goldsman again - that man is a menace). The argument is that this is another cycle in Roland's ongoing quest. Yeah, pull the other one, mate.Lots of details were right. But several things were very, very, wrong. One - this wasn't about the Dark Tower, it was about revenge. Roland was NOT on a single minded quest for the Dark Tower even though this was what drove him through the entire cycle of novels. Two, the huge re-writing of the central story was clearly done with the cinema audience in mind, people who had (mostly) never read the book, yet there were so many unanswered questions in the film where you needed to know the books in order to have the answers. You had to be a Dark Tower reader to fully appreciate it, which more or less guaranteed that you wouldn't! Plus there were questions which still remained unanswered - why did Walter's magics not work on Roland?The casting, performances and visuals were all very good, and I even forgave the absence of Roland's bombardier blue eyes.Will audiences who haven't read the books enjoy it? I have no idea, I'm much too close to the books to stand back far enough to speculate.But I doubt this will have the box office success to merit any revisiting in the near future. Consequently, as someone who has loved these books since the first one was published in 1982, I regard this as a massive missed opportunity and a severe disappointment.",The Dark Tower

19,siderite,"Not having read the books, it was your typical YA thing",7,8 October 2017,"Young regular kid discovers his visions are not a sign of mental illness, encounters absolute evil, finds an adult mentor that teaches him what to do, then does it, pretty much by luck and not any kind of real effort or training. It is your average young adult scenario, banking heavily on Dunning Kruger and Matthew McConaughey as a solid, albeit cardboard, villain.Despite being as average as they come, I liked the young lead. In fact, I think the only actor who stuck like a sore thumb as really bad was the step father guy. However, that doesn't mean that talented actors were not completely underused: Jackie Earle Haley as a lackluster lackey, José Zúñiga and Dennis Haysbert for single scenes and so on. I mean, Abbey Lee got more scenes just because she's a hot Australian chick.Bottom line: I don't know what the books were about, but there are at least seven of them, so I guess the film has little to do with them. As such, it was pretty average.",The Dark Tower
20,Hellmant,Mostly a bore.,5,9 August 2017,"'THE DARK TOWER': Two and a Half Stars (Out of Five)A fantasy-western adapted from Stephen King's novel series (of the same name), and it's actually a continuation of that story (with a planned TV series to follow). The film tells the story of an 11- year-old boy that's transported to another dimension, where he meets a gunslinger on a quest to reach the 'Dark Tower' (which will help him save all of humanity). The movie stars Idris Elba, Tom Taylor and Matthew McConaughey. It's received mostly negative reviews from critics, and it's performed modestly at the Box Office so far. I found it to be pretty disappointing as well, and mostly a bore.Jake Chambers (Taylor) is an 11-year-old boy who's able to see into another dimension, called Mid-World. His parents believe his visions are a form of mental illness though, and they try to get him professional help for it. While being pursued by demons from this other world, Jake is transported to the other dimension. There he meets a gunslinger (Elba) on a quest to reach the 'Dark Tower', which is believed to have the power to save all of humanity. An evil sorcerer (McConaughey) is also trying to reach the tower though, for his own evil purposes.While the film is well cast (you can't get much better than Elba and McConaughey as your two leads), it's also very poorly directed and edited. The film just feels like a mess, and it's never very interesting or involving. Parts of it are amusing though, and some of the effects are cool, but it seems like the book series (which I haven't read) deserved a much better film adaptation. Hopefully the upcoming TV series is much better.Watch an episode of our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/KR0HDeT91m0",The Dark Tower
21,thesar-2,"Happy Easter, Mr. King",4,5 August 2017,"As the end credits rolled, a fairly large portion of the small crowd in our theatre clapped. And clapped. And some more. I turned to my friend and said: ""Did they see a different movie I did?""To be fair, The Dark Tower wasn't necessarily a complete waste, it was serviceable. And that, ""serviceable,"" was a word that held in my head for most of this viewing.The most notable thing about this movie was the enormous amount of Easter Eggs/references to both other King stories and many more movies. In fact, there were so many Stephen King crossovers, it was hard to count. Some I liked, most I rolled my eyes on. And then there were the other films it referenced.So many films and their ideas were here I wondered where this movie's actual original story was hidden. Now, I haven't read any of The Dark Tower novels, so I was going in completely fresh and ready for them to explain to me why so many people love the book franchise. The movie ended over an hour ago and I'm still wondering.Even without reading the stories, I could easily pick up on bits and pieces from the King series. Only, they never once felt fleshed out and only seemed to serve fans by merely mentioning them. Just as I noticed a plot point or one of the numerous expositions, it went away, never to be mentioned or used again. So, I guess those weren't for me after all and just shoehorned in for the fans.If it sounds like I'm ragging on this movie, I haven't even got to the horrible editing, abrupt transitions and the script that felt like it was the 15th draft when the writers simply gave up. The Neverending Story, er, I mean The Two Towers, uh, The Maze Runner, shoot, I mean The Dark Tower is the story of the last Semi-Jed-I, a Warlock with child-like motivations and a boy and his dreams. Good vs. Evil at the most basic of storytelling. Now that the male witch is mentioned, he's probably one of the biggest letdowns of the film. Played by one of my favorites, Matthew McConaughey, he had a character that seemed so deep, so interesting and had the most opportunity to dominate this movie and yet, none of that happened. He was so incredibly bland, unfrightening and it was almost as if McConaughey didn't understand the potential here, or he was horribly misled by the director. Either way, he was another misstep. Like I said, it's serviceable and it's not a huge chore to get through, but by the end, I'm not sure if I actually want to start the book series if this is the visualization of what to expect.***Final thoughts: About half-way through this movie, the 5th or 6th homage to King's better films came up and made me think only of The Simpsons, which probably didn't help the suspense I was supposed to get from this film's revelation:Groundskeeper Willy: (gasps) Boy... you read my thoughts! You've got the Shinning. Bart Simpson: You mean ""Shining"". Groundskeeper Willy: (sotto voice) Shh! You wanna to get sued? Now look, boy: if your Dad goes gaga, you just use that... Shin of yours to call me and I'll come a runnin'. But don't be reading my mind between four and five. That's Willy's time!",The Dark Tower

23,Robert_duder,It is what it is but they made some key mistakes,7,14 August 2017,"The Dark Tower is not a bad film. Standing on it's own it's a decent sci-fi/fantasy flick that comes up a little shallow in certain ways. I am a massive Stephen King fan but I went in to this with mediocre expectations due to reviews and honestly due to the trailers and also word of the reshoots and issues on set. However, as a King fan, I feel like I could have helped them make this or scrapped the whole thing because they missed the mark entirely adapting the book. I thought one of the biggest issues was casting but it turns out the casting wasn't so bad. The issue here is the adaptation itself and also the approach they took on it. The Dark Tower focuses on Jake and Earth and his interaction with the mid-world to save his own. The Dark Tower book series is about Roland and his life and his adventures and his determination to destroy the Man In Black. Roland and the Man In Black were practically supporting characters to the boy Jake and that doesn't work for this story. Roland's back story is weak at best in the film and they don't scratch the surface of Walter or Jake for that matter and the world they live in. If they were hoping to start a franchise they missed the key things they needed here but perhaps most importantly resting the film on Roland. There is a reason the first film was called ""The Gunslinger.""I think Idris Elba is a great actor but I definitely was not sure he would be right for Roland. I was convinced in fact. I was wrong. He could have really done some amazing things with Roland and for what he's given, he does! His darkness and his broodiness fit perfectly and the choreography for his fight scenes are fantastic. He even looks the part very well. Tom Taylor does a great job as Jake, the powerful boy from Earth who can bring down the tower. Taylor and Elba have very good chemistry and I would have loved to have seen them play their roles more to the book. One of the biggest concerns I had was Matthew McConaughey as the Man In Black. Once again, I was wrong. The single only issue is that he is not given enough time or depth to make this an incredible villain. I think he and a good director and writer could have made Walter/Man In Black one of the cinematic great villains. Matthew McConaughey and Idris Elba were good together and played off each other wonderfully but the script didn't give them enough. Supporting cast was okay but the main cast was so under-used that the rest had very little chance of being built up.The Dark Tower could and should have been 2017's beginning to a new Lord of The Rings epic world. They could have built one of the most vast connected Universes ever seen. Could anyone bring this to the big screen/small screen properly given the scope and depth of the books? Yes I think so. Much like Peter Jackson did with Lord of The Rings/The Hobbit someone with true vision and talent could have pulled this off. Why on earth this got handed to someone like Nikolaj Arcel is beyond me. He is a good screenwriter but to leave this in his hands for direction seems careless. Then again perhaps the studio cut it to shreds. A 93 minute run time is insane for a film of this magnitude. The Dark Tower will hopefully be redeemed. The characters are in place, the special effects were good, the world is loosely established but someone needs to step in. 7.5/10",The Dark Tower
24,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"An overstuffed, underdeveloped mess that rushes to a blink-and-you'll-miss-it finale that only has one saving grace: it doesn't really set up a direct sequel.",4,16 April 2018,"By the time this overstuffed, underdeveloped mess finally gets interesting, it's rushed to its conclusion in a bizarre move that feels like the studio saw an early cut and decided that it was entirely too ludicrous to expect a sequel and so pushed for a blink-and-you'll-miss-it finish that wraps everything up with one conveniently placed bullet. 'The Dark Tower (2017)' feels as though it was hurried along from day one and, while I can't attest to the quality of the source novels as I haven't read them nor now have any desire to (though they apparently serve as a prequel to this and so direct comparison isn't technically possible), the story is so clichéd and silly that it's hard to engage with, especially when it tries to introduce its tiresome high-concept aspects into a contemporary world (along with a few odd Stephen King based references no less). I was bored for the majority of the run-time and cringing for the rest. The flick certainly needed more time in the oven, and a more competent chef, too. 4/10",The Dark Tower
25,ericstevenson,"You win some, you lose some",4,1 October 2017,"This movie came out very close to ""It"", one of the most critically acclaimed Stephen King films of all time. Would we be lucky enough to have two great Stephen King movies in a single year? Of course not! I believe I read the first chapter or so of the original Dark Tower book. It's a pity I'm not into reading much anymore. I'm not judging the movie from what little I read as they are separate things. What makes this movie bad is all the little things. First off, the movie's only 95 minutes long and it's based on King's biggest doorstopper or at least spread out over volumes. ""It"" made the right decision by starting with a long movie.The characters in this are outright annoying. The main kid beats up another kid so he's not portrayed very sympathetically. The gunslinger actually dangles the kid over a cliff further showing how unpleasant these characters are. The villain is very shallow and it's quite hard to take what he takes seriously. He just says a few words like ""Stop breathing"" and it magically causes his victims to do that. We get shootouts that are reminiscent of much better films like ""The Matrix"". It's all been done before and much better. While ""It"" was a classic, this is anything but. *1/2",The Dark Tower

Observed as book adaptation, this movie is complete failure. Never in my life I saw anything that mutilates original material to these proportions. Believe it or not, even Russian Lolita is more faithful to the book than this blasphemy. Explanation why and how this movie insults The Dark Tower saga would become saga itself, and I really have no time and nerves to spend hours in review of something I'm sick of. As adaptation of the book this movie is 0/10. Now, if I try to observe it unrelated to the book, I must admit it is not complete disaster, but it's still lousy. If you did not read the book, movie will be too fast and confusing. Story can not be understood correctly without pre- knowledge from the book, and yet, if you have that pre-knowledge you will understand better and hate it better. Observed independently from the book this movie is below average fantasy action, and I would rate it 4, maybe 5 out of ten.

30,The-Sarkologist,Compressing a Seven Book Series into a Single Film,7,19 August 2017,"After watching this film a part of me wanted to go back and try my hand at reading the Stephen King novels again, and not just the ones upon which this film is based, but a number of other ones as well. Interestingly it appears that all of Stephen King's novels actually take place in the same multiverse, all of which are connected to, and preserved by, the Dark Tower. Mind you, I was a little surprised to see that an entire series of books was compressed into a single movie, but then again there are some hints that maybe this film isn't going to be the only one in the series and that there might be another one down the track (depending, of course, on how well this one is received, which I suspect wasn't all that well).So, we have the Man in Black, which happens to be a rather powerful sorcerer who is wanting to destroy the Dark Tower. No real reason behind that, expect that maybe having the world overrun by demons is somewhat better than having a world where all of the demons have been banished to the outer realms. He does this by kidnapping children who happen to be psychic, binding them to a machine, and then draining their psychic power and firing it at the tower. We also have Jack, the protagonist, and a boy that dreams of this other world, but is not only considered crazy, but his parents basically want to lock him away (or at least his step dad does because, well, step dads are always pretty nasty and want to get rid of the kids). Finally we have the Gunslinger, who is a warrior of the Athurian ilk who is on a quest to defeat the man in black.The concept behind the stories are really good, which is a shame that I wasn't able to get much beyond the first book. In a way the idea of meshing fantasy and western can work well, particularly since science-fiction and western have been merged numerous times in the past. As for the film, I did like it, though of course it suffers from your typical clichés, such as the horrid stepdad that wants the mother but not the kids, and the young boy who is never believed.I guess a part of the idea here, and it is a good thing, is that it challenges our secularisation of society – children that don't fit in aren't necessarily anti-social or suffer from mental illness, rather it is a symptom of a society that doesn't celebrate diversity. Sure, we might say we do, but in reality we really only pay lip service to the whole thing, and people that don't fit the mould are either disruptive or worse. In a way it is okay to be different, and long as being different doesn't disrupt the world that we have created.In a sense this is a theme that we seem to see appearing regularly throughout Hollywood, as if the movie makers are actually the ones who when they were young were actually the outcasts. Yet, we can't ignore the fact that Hollywood is still a closed shop that is pretty ruled not so much by the unions, but by a union that in effect represents a certain element of the wealthy elite. However, Hollywood has a tremendous influence on society, and while many of us scoff at it, and claim that it is corrupting our society, in reality it is challenging the social norm, and outing those who seek to exploit certain elements of society. The idea of the geeky, outcast kid, coming about and saving the world is evidence of that (though I do feel that the evil step dad does go a little too far at times).",The Dark Tower

Another fantasy series, but is it worth is the real question. I don't know how famous is the original source, but I did not find the film any good. For me, it was another teen film like the majority of similarly themed films that flopped terribly. But here, an adult holds a prominent role that played by Idris Elba.Maybe this is just an introduction, but still the first impression failed. The youngsters might enjoy it better than the adults. Particularly the teenagers. A teenager having a series of strange dreams about another world is all actually comes true when he enters through a portal to one of those worlds in the same universe. Now he's tailed by a most dangerous force in the universe, but accompanied by a gunslinger, he has to find a way to stop an apocalypse that's going strike his world and to rest of the universe.Being very simple could be the reason I did not enjoy it. Basically, there's no twist in it. What they have called twist was a cliche in this kind of theme. The cast was okay, and so the visuals. But it all points to the story. The sequel could get better, so lets wait and see. In the meantime, I've heard that a completely a new version of the television series is on the development. I hope it works out better than the film franchise. Finally, it is an average film, neither worth nor a waste of time! I hope you make the right decision regarding watching it!5/10",The Dark Tower

Since I've never read a Stephen King book, I (thankfully) can't compare it to any book and therefore was able to view it as a stand-alone movie.'The Dark Tower' is good, but not great, but it feels all too familiar. The film reminded me to a certain extent of 'Terminator 2', with Idris Elba in a similar role as Arnold Schwarzenegger and Tom Taylor's character - and acting - all too similar to Edward Furlong's character in 'Terminator 2'. Matthew McConaughey's character reminded me of Christopher Walken in 'The Prophecy'. The tower itself reminded me of the Lord of the Rings movies. The portals reminded me of the portals in 'Timecop'. The 'face masks' were reminiscent of the 'V' TV series. So, you see, this hardly felt original.The best part about the movie were the good visuals, and Idris Elba. The young Tom Taylor also delivered a fine performance. Yes, there's action and adventure and good photography, but in the end it felt like a mash-up of other films, and offered nothing new.

36,tomgillespie2002,Feels nothing like a final product,3,24 November 2017,"Adapting a series of beloved novels spanning thousands of pages and countless characters and worlds into a consumable stand-alone movie was never going to be an easy task. Over the years, many names have been attached to developing Stephen King's Dark Tower novels, including the combined efforts of J.J. Abrams and Damon Lindelof during their Lost days, and Ron Howard. When it became apparent that these novels were indeed unfilmable, they understandably bailed, and the film found itself in limbo once again. After 10 years of rewrites and personnel changes, The Dark Tower finally arrives in the hands of Nikolaj Arcel, the director of fantastic Danish period drama A Royal Affair. Reports of heavy re-shoots and a frustrated cast was never a good sign, and while it isn't quite the incoherent, tumour-inducing non-entity of Josh Trank's Fantastic Four, The Dark Tower will leave fans of the novels shaking their heads and newcomers scratching them.The final result is a stuttering mess of disconnected scenes loosely held together by a baffling plot that seems to throw in every fantasy element except the magical kitchen sink. We have a western without the West, a fantasy without the fantastical, and a familiar 'Chosen One' thread fronted by a forgettable child actor. In part a sequel to King's novels and an origin story of sorts, The Dark Tower doesn't know what it is, and increasingly throughout the film it feels as though the studio just stopped trying in the hope that it would eventually make its money back from book fans and teenagers hungry for some fantasy action. Scenes play out with seemingly no connection to what came before and -although I don't know if I was just imagining it or simply looking for something to distract my attention from the sheer tedium of the plot - actors' lips seemed to have been altered by CGI as the script was re-written after scenes were shot. You may also find yourself jolting awake every 5 minutes at the sound of Idris Elba's magical guns.Eleven year-old Jake Chambers (Tom Taylor) possesses the 'Shine', a power of shady definition but one which allows him to subconsciously peer into other worlds. In his dreams, he has visions of a giant dark tower, an evil man in dressed in black intent on bringing down the tower, and a mysterious gunslinger. He draws his visions and hangs them on his bedroom wall, so naturally his mother and douchebag stepfather think he's crazy and arranges for him to spend some time away in a psychiatric facility. He runs away to find a building from his dreams (which just happens to be in his home city of New York), and finds a portal which transports him to the apocalyptic wastelands of Mid- World. There, he quickly encounters the gunslinger from his dreams: A man named Roland Deschain (Elba) who is part of an ancient order of knights who carry out justice with guns forged from Excalibur. He is also visited by the man in black, a sorcerer named Walter Padick (Matthew McConaughey) who aims to harness children's screams in order to topple the Dark Tower holding all the worlds together.When the film isn't trying to explain everybody's backgrounds to the audience through endless exposition, it expects us to simply accept this nonsense. I haven't read King's books, but it carries a reputation as being a complex and detailed piece of work requiring audience investment to drink in its slow-build approach. Arcel's movie opts to cram as much as it can into just 95 minutes, without dedicating anywhere near enough time to properly explain the universe's mythos. For a film so short and convoluted, it's almost impressive how boring it manages to be. Elba, like he does in most franchise-building, big-budget affair, seems to huff his way through the film with his eyes half-closed as though he is waiting for his next 'serious' project. McConaughey at least injects some energy into his poorly-developed bad guy, although he may just be happy he's not making horrible rom-coms anymore. It's scant praise for a movie that feels nothing like a final product, and more like a bunch of outtakes found in a bin and glued together with Pritt Stick by a janitor with a penchant for generic fantasy CGI.",The Dark Tower

38,cruise01,A plot that lacks depth and development but decent action and concept that is entertaining.,6,5 August 2017,"The long awaited Dark Tower series being adapted on the big screen from phenomenal writer Stephen King. I have never read the long running series of books. So I am coming from a fresh perspective to the movie. I will have to say The Dark Tower is not as bad the critics are making it out to be. It may have its problems and not the best movie of the year. It is a fair film that makes it worth watching. I am sure the books are epic and long. And this film only being an hour and a half sure does make it feel like they have took a lot out from the context. Sure, for a good reasoning they wanted to make the plot leaner and understandable for the audience that are not familiar with the dark tower world. The plot does feel lean. I feel like they could have made the film longer to have a character development with Jake (Tom Taylor) and the gunslinger Roland (Idris Elba). The film is fast paced. It cuts right into the chase. We are introduced to the Men in Black (Matthew McConaughey) who has some magical powers that can demand anyone to do anything (even kill off characters by telling them stop breathing). The Men in Black and his people are kidnapping children and placing them into a machine that is used as a weapon to destroy the dark tower. The dark tower is used as a shield barrier in protecting the universe from other dimensions (even the dark dimensions with mystical creatures and demons). The failed attempt in destroying the dark tower cause earthquakes in many worlds. Even on Earth, were Jake (Tom Taylor) has been having nightmares and visions of the gunslinger, the darkness, the men in back, etc. When the men in back are after him cause his mind is stronger than others. Jake finds a portal to transport him into the mid world. Where he runs into the gunslinger Roland, who is hell-bent on wanting to kill the Men in Black. The film was never boring. It is entertaining throughout. The plot feels like there could have been more depth to the story and characters. With its short running time, it spends majority of it with Jake and Roland roaming the mid world coming across a nightmarish beast. And trying to locate the men in black.The action is decent. There is lots of it. The chases and the gun shoots out are exciting to see but nothing worth revisiting. Director Nikolaj Arcel does not feel like he is experienced enough in handling the direction with the action and shoot out scenes. The visual effects were also decent. The concept and premise of the movie is interesting. I would love to see more of it. Cause some of the ideas in the movie are briefly shown or barely discussed with the characters. Such as the Men in Black and their magical powers and Roland being the last gunslinger in a apocalyptic world. Idris Elba was great as the character. It is fun to see him and Jake interact as they are both from different worlds. Matthew McConaughey was also good as the villain. Tom Taylor was also good as Jake.Overall, The Dark Tower is a fair fantasy film. It has its share of action and chases. Interesting premise with the dark tower and characters. The acting was also good as well. In its short running time, it lacks the proper development and story depth. That does leave you wanting more once it ends.",The Dark Tower
39,Dr_Coulardeau,"Apart from the guns, everything is mediocre",5,24 January 2018,"If you have read the eight-volume saga entitled The Dark Tower by Stephen King, you will be disappointed in the worst possible way. This film does not have the magic, the tension and the perspective the saga has. Why on earth does Stephen King accept to put his name on such a treacherous betrayal of his work, of his art? It is beyond me.This film is a mediocre action film for teenagers, and not too old please, with a little bit of fantasy, a little bit of violence, a little bit of magic, and everything mixed up and whipped together with galore special effects. And really nothing actually saves the project. Too bad because the saga is a masterpiece in all possible ways brought down to earth and made to bite the dust by this adaptation.If you really want to have an adventure going to the Dark Tower and seeing the Crimson King just before finding out it is a never-ending always ever restarting again story, you better buy the eight volumes and get ready to read some seven thousand pages. Then you will find what fantasy is under the pen and in the hands of Stephen King. Not this tasteless daub, for sure.Dr. Jacques COULARDEAU",The Dark Tower
40,zkonedog,"If Not Awful, Then Pointless At Very Best",3,7 August 2017,"When reading reviews or word-of-mouth about ""The Dark Tower"", one would think it the worst film ever produced. It isn't that. What it is, however, is a pointless 95 minutes that skims the basic concepts of Stephen King's beloved ""Tower-verse"" and does nothing to build momentum towards the books ever getting the adaptation they deserve.For a basic plot summary, this film lays out the very basic conflict: There is a Tower that controls all known universes and binds them together (against terrible, demon-like outside forces). An old Gunslinger (the last of his/its kind) named Roland (Idris Elba) is ostensibly set on defending the Tower (though not without a few bumps along the way). Opposing Roland is the Man in Black (Matthew McConaughey), who has the opposite goal of bringing the Tower to rubble in order to rule in the chaos that follows. His plan to do this involves using the minds of children who have ""the Shine"", a special psychic ability that can focus their minds to achieve a physical task. This brings the story to young Jake Chambers (Tom Taylor), an Earth boy about to be sent to a psychological institution because of his troubling ""dreams"" of a man in black and a man toting guns. Of course, these ""dreams"" turn out to be more real than anyone can imagine, and soon Jake is pulled into the conflict for all worlds.Let me start by saying this: Getting The Dark Tower series from the page to the big screen was always going to be a daunting task because the first book in the series (""The Gunslinger"") is the worst (least-sensical). As such, I completely understand why a film-maker couldn't just adapt that book and roll forward.The problem, however, is that it seems like this film went through so many story adaptations and versions that it comes out as mind-numbingly generic just to get it into theaters at all. Totally gone is the character nuance and fascinating world-building in the King books. In its place is a distilled version of bullet points that try to lay out the main conflict. This does happen, but in probably the most boring way possible.In other words, what it looks like really happened with ""The Dark Tower"" is that never once during its multiple adaptations was anyone really able to step up and make it ""their own project"". It was teased so heavily by Sony, however, that to not release the film at all would have been a major ""egg-on-their-face"" moment. So, the result is a half-baked story that doesn't do justice to what could be an epic series.Is ""The Dark Tower"" the worst movie I've ever seen in my life? No. It has some pretty decent special effects, a story is present (albeit a lifeless one), and the acting can rise above the material at times.The bottom line, though, is that this movie in no way, shape, or form begins to do justice to Stephen King's epic book series. Like I said, I understand the decision to not do a straight book-for-book adaptation schedule (as the books' structure do not lend themselves to that), but ""The Dark Tower"" goes too far in the opposite direction and instead makes the proceedings incredibly bland and not indicative of a series on the rise whatsoever.It will be interesting to see how this ""franchise"" moves forward in the years to come. Perhaps it can pull itself out of the ashes and better adapt King's crazy imagination, but this is not a good start by any stretch of the imagination.",The Dark Tower

42,eddie_baggins,A poor version of an incredible book series,4,17 August 2017,"Let's be clear, The Dark Tower is not (sad to say) an adaptation of Stephen King's epic and beloved Dark Tower series of novels.King's work's, that combined to become 8, each in their own way special books, have here been diluted to the point of almost unrecognizability by Denmark-born director Nikolaj Arcel, who alongside his team of 4 screenwriters that includes frequent hack Akiva Goldsman, have created a hodgepodge collection of what feel like Dark Tower's greatest hits moments, that combine various books into one seriously quick and frequently misguided big screen experience.It's an extremely unfocused attempt at adapting King's material to screen. The story needs and deserves time to be properly built up and we get none of that, with Arcel instead turning his attention to Tom Taylor's young Jake Chambers, who harbors an incredible 'shine"" ability that will see him become the number one target for Matthew McConaughey's Walter aka The Man in Black.There's near no backstory on the landscape of Mid-World, the tower or even the Gunslingers themselves, so many who have never read King's books will be mightily confused by some dialogue or even situations, while Arcel's decision to focus the films attentions on Chambers makes Roland a secondary figure, in a story that was and always should've been about the last standing member of the Line of Eld, the last gunslinger who hasn't forgotten the face of his father.It's a real shame that Idris Elba gets such short supply of things to do in this tale, while a controversial pick for Roland Deschain originally, he quickly wins us over with his undeniable charisma and gruff outward persona but Arcel doesn't give him near enough screen time or cinematic backstory and it's hard for us to feel like his the integral part of this story, that is both about the protection of the tower and Roland's quest to finally put an end to Walter's reign of terror and tyranny.Whenever Elba and McConaughey get to go head to head the film elevates, or when we are allowed brief glimpses of the gunslingers incredible talents with gun in hand the film becomes more exciting but at the end of the day it feels more frustrating than anything as it often seems as though Arcel had no excuses to deliver such a generic and forgettable experience from a series of stories that are anything but.His actors all could've done so much had they been allowed to, and it truly feels as though the film's oft-delayed release was clearly centred around a battle in the editing suite to make both a shortened and cookie cutter version of a layered adventure and one that eschews many of King's important yet dark and violent themes into a seen-before type of experience that appeals to the lowest common denominator possible.Hard-core fans of the books will be mightily disappointed with these aspects, as well as key book figures like Eddie, Susannah and even Oi failing to make an appearance and while there's fan service as such getting to see lobstrosities on screen and locations such as The Dixie Pig, none of them feel fully utilised, which you can say absolutely applies to this production that fails to take the burning fire of imagination from King's books and instead takes a mere flicker of a flame to the big screen that all harks back to Arcel's uninspired direction and mediocre script work.Final Say – The Dark Tower might not be the worst film this year; it does have moments (tiny brief moments) that nevertheless showcase just what might've been and Elba and McConaughey feel a league above the film they've been placed into, but for many of us that have been waiting these many (double) moons for a faithful big screen adaptation of King's opus that does justice to the famed author's most personal works, it looks like we will need to wait patiently for this to one day still occur.Dark Tower fans: may your days be long upon the earth to see this happen.2 after battle Hot Dogs out of 5",The Dark Tower

44,leonblackwood,Pretty Poor!,2,11 January 2018,"Review:
What an awful film! After watching the trailer for this movie, I thought it looked really interesting, and the cast was half decent but it turned out to be a right mess, and the little kid, Jake (Tom Taylor) was extremely annoying. The movie is based on some dark tower, which holds the universe together, and it's been protected by the Gunslingers, who have been destroyed by the Man in Black, Walter (Matthew McConaughey). As the last survivor of the Gunslingers, Roland (Idris Elba) seeks revenge after Walter murders his father, so it's a battle against good and evil, with the fate of the world's at stake. Jake, who has dreams about the Dark Tower, Roland and Walter, draws his thoughts, which makes everyone think that he has personal problems. His mum decides to send him to a psychiatric school but he escapes from the wardens, who also work for Walter, and he goes through a portal that leads him to Roland. They then join forces to kill Walter, who is always two steps ahead but with Rolands superb shooting skills and Jakes unique mind, they soon work out a way to get to Walter, and save the world. The Stephen King novel was definitely not portrayed well, and I'm surprised to say that McConaughey and Elba was pretty awful in the leading roles. I also was expecting some big showdown at the end, after such a big build up but that also turned out to be a total let down, along with the poor visual effects. The director wasted way to much time on Jake's storyline, and Walter seemed to be evil, for no reason what so ever, which just became a bit tedious after a while. Anyway, I really didn't enjoy this film, and I certainly didn't feel entertained, so it has to get the thumbs down from me. Disappointing!Round-Up:
This movie was directed by Nikolaj Arcel, 45, who also brought you King's Game, Island Of Lost Souls, Truth About Men and a Royal Affair in 2012. Judging by his previous work, I was surprised that he was chosen to direct this Stephen King novel, and I was also surprised to see that this movie made a profit, because it is pretty bad. The cast played a big part in drawing an audience but I'm sure that a lot of people were disappointed with the outcome. On the plus side, some of the fast gun action was half decent and McConaughey did look the part but that's the only positive vibes that I got from this film.Budget: $60million

45,TheMovieDiorama,The Dark Tower is just wasted potential.,4,2 March 2018,"When the source material is thick with interesting concepts and so beloved by fans, it makes me question why a studio would choose an amateur director to helm the adaptation. Why? It's just destined to be a critical failure and thus a box office bomb. It's not all doom and gloom though, there were a quite a few elements that I appreciated. So the story is about a boy who dreams of a tower that protects the universe, the ""man in black"" wishes to destroy it and the Gunslinger is chosen to protect it. Except it's not a dream. Basic premise done, but as it's a fantasy film there are numerous amounts of sub-plots, special powers and conveniences. Idris Elba and Matthew McConaughey were both great lead actors, they just about saved this flick from being a total disaster. I appreciated the heavy world building that the script contained, I mean there is a lot of lore and rules in these alternate worlds and I thought they were explained well. Most of the visual effects looked high quality, apart from any human CGI scenes...just plain bad. So where are the problems? The main problem is rushing. Everything was rushed into a 90 minute runtime. It was too much! Completely overstuffed, just not enough time to get through everything and deliver an entertaining blockbuster. The screenplay literally consisted of plot explanations. Seriously, nearly every other line explains something that will happen or is meant to happen. It's all spoon fed which decreases the tension and fun. The editing was rushed, scenes seemed half finished and then quickly cut in an attempt to make a coherent narrative. Didn't work. The camera work was rushed, especially the action sequences which suffered from poor lighting and shaky cam. The ending was rushed, the story is resolved in 5 minutes. Wait...make it 2 minutes. Our antagonist doesn't express his motives for doing the things he does...he just does it because he is the ""bad guy"". I seriously appreciated the thought that went into this, I really did...but ultimately it failed and didn't deliver. Shame, such a shame.",The Dark Tower
46,Tweetienator,Bold 'n' Bad,4,8 October 2017,"I read some novels and short stories written by Stephen King but never one of the books of The Dark Tower series and I watched the movie before I informed myself about the books, and boy was I surprised - they really cooked down 7 or 8 books to one movie!? That's bold. Well, after I got that information I understood why the whole movie felt the whole time incomplete, fragmentary and superficial to me.The Dark Tower movie: not really bad but not good either, it feels a little bit like Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children or Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them to me - the books may be good and show some fine imagination, but the movies are just mediocre, forgettable, standard storytelling, the respective world and its wonders and potentials never get explored, the viewer is not involved or sucked into the world or emphasizes with the characters. And I guess for the readers and fans of King's Dark Tower the experience of watching the movie must be an even more disappointing one.Sad it is, all those stories/books would have deserved better movie adaptations - like the new TV show The Mist, or the new It (imho no horror movie but a kids adventure) this one also, does not do any justice to Stephen King's work, and if this movie is meant to be an appetizer for an upcoming show, nah, I am not interested, you already lost me - you will just rip-off a ""franchise"" with a predictable generic story.Final words: Shining and Misery and a few other adaptations are the exceptions to the rule: King's writing put into motion pictures just don't work well.",The Dark Tower

48,Vartiainen,Lacks focus more anything else,6,9 August 2019,"The Dark Tower is based on a Stephen King book series of the same name. Technically speaking you could say it's a cinematic sequel to those books, but getting into the nitty gritty of that would be a massive spoiler. It's easier to think of it as an adaptation.Jake Chambers (Tom Taylor) has recently begun to have visions of another world. Of a dark tower and a man in black, who tries to destroy it. He's also dreamed of a gunslinger, chasing after the man in black. Things take a turn for the worse when the man in black learns of his existence and the power of his visions.I'd consider myself a big fan of the original book series. It had its ups and downs, but its scope and style are still something I greatly admire. The way King uses this magnum opus of his to bridge to gaps between all his others works, the way it mixes science fiction, westerns and fantasy into a cohesive whole. And I really like the characters. Roland Deschain is one of my all time favourite literature characters.Which is why it saddens me to say that this film doesn't live up to its potential. Not that Idris Elba makes for a bad Roland. Quite the opposite in fact. He has the gravitas and the presence to be Roland. Likewise, Matthew McConaughey convinces as Walter, the man in black. Tom Taylor as Jake is a bit of a hit-n-miss, but that's honestly at least partly because Jake was never the strongest character in the books either. Why they decided to focus on him, I have no idea. Audience appeal, perhaps?But no, what this movie lacks most of all is focus. It tries too hard to please both the newcomers and the book fans. And in doing so it loses them both. It's too jumbled, too full of reverences and callbacks, for any newcomer to know what's going on. And because it's only a feature film, and not even that long of a one, it just doesn't have the room to give us the characters we have grown to love in the books. You can't make a cohesive film out of seven long novels. Eight now, actually, come to think of it. You just can't, but by heavens this film is trying.The film has its moments. There are some cool shots and the final meeting between Roland and Walter is a pleasing visual experience, if nothing else. The locations look nice, the action works and here and there it reaches that Dark Tower feeling. Not often, but here and there. I'm kind of glad I saw it, but I don't think I can recommend it to my fellow book fans.",The Dark Tower

Just so cool as this gunslinger, but let me give props to this guy, Matthew McConaughey who was that cool type of evil that makes you oh and ah when he does something evil. The action was pretty tight. Not the best Stephen King adaption, but I like how they added a bunch of trivial references to his other work. It all starts out with this kid who is having bad dreams that make his mind disturbed to the point that his mom and step-mom want to get him medical attention. As it turns out he has the Shine (Just like the kid in the movie the Shinning, another Stephen King Adaption), and he uses it to seek out the Gunslinger, whose duty it is to stop the Man in Black who actually needs kids with the shine to help him destroy a tower that will mean the death of the multi-verse they live in if he's successful.

50,jamesrupert2014,Short and superficial,5,2 October 2018,"I have not read the books but I am aware of their length and depth, and there was a very superficial feel to this film. The surreal post-apocalyptic imagery on Mid-World was very good, but little was done with it. I love the idea of 'The Gunslinger' crossing an endless preternatural desert in pursuit of the man in black but was lost interest when he goes to New York for some simple 'fish out of water' shtick and presumably lower production costs. The action scenes focussed too much on over-the-top, physics (and logic) defying gunplay (which has been better done in less 'serious' films like ""Kick Ass"" (2010) or ""Shoot Em'up"" (2007)), and other than main villain 'Walter Padick', the targets were generic nasties, who were neither a threat nor interesting. The cast was generally good, especially Idris Elba, and I didn't mind Matthew McConaughey as King's omnipresent demonic bad guy (aka Randall Flagg, The Walking Dude, etc). Apparently the film is a set up for a TV series and it had that bloodless look and budget feel. I suspect that this is another example of a complex and detailed story overly simplified to fit into a short running time (95 min.) and modest budget. King can be a superlative writer but the films rarely do justice to his dark, imaginative and often memorably disturbing books.",The Dark Tower

What could have made the film better if it explored more on The Gunslinger and The Man in Black, but because it doesn't the movie feels so shortened down. Matthew McConaughey really gives it all has the evil man in black with supernatural powers, quite a devilish performance. Idris Elba gives a descent performance has the broken down hero known has The Gunslinger. The film feels like combination of The Wizard of Oz and Star Wars. The final showdown between The Gunslinger and The Man in Black is not great, but effective. And the effects are descent to say the least.

Honestly, it's a King movie, it doesn't need to be good. I mean look at the body of work that was made that people actually would agree were good: The Dead Zone, The Green Mile, Stand By Me, Shawshank, Carrie (1976), and The Shining (arguably among fans).6 movies...that's about it. The rest are mediocre, 1408, Cat's Eyes, Misery, Firestarter.And the rest are low budget throw away films that can be enjoyed the same way that one can enjoy any B-Movie...and that's fine. I have a feeling that King appreciates B-Movies more than you'd think. At least that's what he wrote in ""On Writing."" But this...what the heck is this? Honestly, the Dark Tower series is one of my least favorite things that King has ever written...and I am a huge King fan...but even then, I didn't expect it to be this bad.For starters, it's really not the Dark Tower. I mean, the characters are the same in name...but really in name only.the Gunslinger is chasing the Man in Black...and that is all the similarities we have.You can't blame the actors on this one. You can't blame the source material either, they are at least readable.What you have here is a film that was re-written over and over and over and over again with, what I am guessing, is massive studio interference.The series is already a big part of pulp culture, it already has a huge following...but watching this you get the feeling that some important people didn't understand that and had it rewritten a thousand time to try to make a franchise out of it, rather than use the franchise already in place. Only they wanted to make a franchise by putting the entire franchise into a single film.In the end you can almost feel the different writers when you watch it. You can see where it was meant to go in one direction, then got taken in another, and then a third and a fourth until the actors were so confused they had no choice but to give up.In the end, I got the impression that no one involved knew exactly what they were trying to make any longer.Really, we should be demanding an instant remake and a total refund.

FYI: The Dark Tower novels connect characters from other Stephen King books into the same universe. If you keep an eye out, you can spot lots of little 'nods' to his other books and I even saw a movie theater that was showing spaghetti westerns-nod to The Good, The Bad & The Ugly. Anyway, the plot is probably more of what you are interested in, so here goes. There is a big tower at the center of the universe that keeps evil in check. All these different universes-one of them is ours-surround it and can be reached by using portals. Tom plays a boy on our world that keeps having dreams of Idris' world. Idris is a gunslinger-the last of his kind-that is in a never ending battle with Matthew, aka, The Man in Black, a dark and evil sorcerer that is always trying to destroy the tower and unleash evil across all the universes. Matthew can just wave his hand and say a word, like sleep, and the person will sleep, or anything else, depending on what he says-stop breathing, kill someone, etc. Jackie is one of Matthew's lackeys that do his bidding-probably because they are afraid of what Matthew might say to them if they don't.

I don't have a particular attachment to the books (I've read the first installment more than once, but it never grabbed me), so I can't say I noted any essential changes to the source material. Actually, maybe it should've gone a bit further in that respect, because the finished product feels awfully dry and basic, like the first two or three chapters of a much bigger story. Whilst our bare-bones good versus evil saga bathed in the afterglow of its final showdown, I wondered ""is that all?""Idris Elba is a bold, effective casting as the central hero, The Gunslinger. He's gruff and no-nonsense, a reliable badass with just a hint of feral intensity in his eye, but his character isn't interesting beyond the standard grunting action scenes and a few easy fish-out-of-water bits. Much more promising is the film's foil; the mysterious, malevolent, reality-shaping, portal-jumping ""Man in Black"" played by Matthew McConaughey. It's a crucial (if difficult) part, and McConaughey's complete failure to elevate himself effectively dooms the picture. He's downright bad in this film, frequently crossing the line from creepy to campy and whiffing on all the major dialogue points.There's potential here: some wonderful effects work (an impressive, if fleeting, showdown with an aggressive wooden house springs to mind), the right mood and atmosphere, but it's excessively cryptic (lazily relying on audiences to draw their own conclusions) and doesn't pack enough punch.

57,alindsay-al,An average real missed opportunity,5,18 August 2017,"This film had so much potential that I was really looking forward to the dark tower, but this film is a big wasted opportunity that is a big let down. The premise of the film sees a young boy having visions of a different world. He suddenly joins that world and looks to help a mysterious gunslinger against the nefarious man in black. Idris Elba is one of the best actors going today and I was really excited to see him play the gunslinger and he absolutely owned the role. His character was really interesting to watch and was easily the heart in the film seeing this guy trying to work out what his role is in the universe. The biggest surprise in this film is a really good performance by the young actor tom Taylor who plays Jake and was really good. He delivered a mature performance beyond his years and I thought he had good chemistry with Elba which helps the film. Matthew mcConaughey plays the man in black in this film and he clearly revels in the role with an over the top performance of villainy that I can't deny is entertaining. But this film has other supporting characters that are really dull and are meant to be Important but you just won't care. The story in this film has a lot of call lore to it but its execution is really poor, the villain's plot is super weak and his motivations don't make this films plot particularly interesting. There are some decent things but this film isn't long enough for you to care about any of the plot points in this film. The script has some decent dramatic dialogue especially towards the end that made me care more about the relationship between the gunslinger and Jake. However, the attempts at humour are here to see and I just didn't find it funny at all which made it seem more awkward then anything else. The style of this film has some decent actions scenes, especially when Elba is unleashing his gunslinger abilities that are super entertaining to watch. Then we get to the worst part of this film which is the fact that this film is only like 90 minutes long which is ridiculously short for a film like this. There were things that I wanted to learn more about but the film glosses it over and it feels like a jumbled mess.

The end result wasn't received as well as the producers had hoped. The fans ended up unhappy but how could they have been anything but? The series of books was 8 volumes and over 4,000 pages long. No way could that be condensed into a 90 minute movie. And yet they tried. Maybe not the whole story but a good portion of it.Jake (Tom Taylor) is a New York City pre-teen who is seriously troubled. His father has died, his mother's new boyfriend isn't fond of him and to top it off he keeps having bad dreams revolving around a man in black, a dark tower and a gunslinger. Passed off as having emotional issues his mother intends to send him off to an institute for troubled youth but Jake realizes the two people sent to pick him up are part of the group he has been having visions of. He escapes and finds his way to a home he sees in his visions, one that provides a portal into the other world he keeps seeing.Making his way there is one thing, knowing what's going on another. Fortunately he runs into the gunslinger in his visions, a man named Roland Deschain (Idris Elba). Roland is the last of a group of warriors known as gunslingers, pistol packing fighters whose job it was to protect this land and the Dark Tower from being toppled. Should that happen evil will be unleashed upon all worlds.Roland is well aware of the Man in Black, Walter Padick (Matthew McConaughey). Walter killed Roland's father and helped to wipe out the gunslingers. A master sorcerer Walter also has plans for the Dark Tower. As Jake has seen in his visions, he is harnessing the minds of young children to create projectiles to destroy the tower. His hope is to make himself a god by doing so.Jake and Roland set off on a path to prevent this from happening. At first somewhat adversarial the two eventually become friends. With the combined desire to take down Walter they unite with that common goal, bonding in the process. But can their combined efforts achieve the success they seek? And what is it about Jake that Walter finds necessary to achieve the goals he has in mind? The movie isn't near as bad as the fans might have you believe but it is lacking a bit. While I'm always one to say that Hollywood needs to cut back on the length of their movies it actually does this one harm. The movie doesn't allow enough time to develop the characters, to understand them and their motivations or to present enough background on them. Fortunately for me I was able to look online to understand the movie better by looking into who and what they are.Watching the film you're not quite sure if Walter is a sorcerer, a demon or the devil himself. Roland is not near as effective as he is in the books by what I read. And Jake isn't the central focus of the books and yet takes center stage here.In addition to that the movie does present an ending. For a movie based on 8 books you would think it would be an introduction rather than a finale. I mean look at the Lord of the Rings movies, 3 separate films that were well over 2 hours each that combined to tell the story of three books. This one could have been, and actually was intended to, tell a much bigger story. From what I've read it was supposed to be an introduction to a series on TV (I'm guessing cable due to violence) rather than a complete tale.Still, as someone who came in never having read the books and interested in seeing what it was all about, the movie plays out in an entertaining enough manner. The shortcomings are smoother over by the professional look and feel of the film. The CGI isn't overly used to the point of being annoying but getting there. Elba, McConaughey and Taylor all do a good job here. The end result is a movie to enjoy on its own merits, setting aside the book series and potential TV series. That being said you might enjoy this one.",The Dark Tower
60,kluseba,One of the best literary adaptations in recent memory,9,23 August 2017,"I'm not familiar with The Dark Tower novel series and I didn't expect much going into this movie with a few friends. To my surprise, The Dark Tower turned out being one of the best movies of the year so far.It's never easy to transform one or several novels into one or several movies. Most of those films are extremely long and fans still complain that different characters or plot elements aren't included. Many of those films feel unfinished and often end on cliffhangers, implying that there will be one or several sequels. Many of those movies are only interesting for those familiar with the novels as a lot of information is omitted in the films which are hard to follow for those unfamiliar with the novels.The Dark Tower avoids all those mistakes so many movies make. The movie is short and concise with a healthy length around one and a half hours. This film doesn't end on a cliffhanger and tells a coherent story from start to finish. It might be possible that there are going to be other movies involving the main characters of this film but with completely new story lines. The film was easy to understand for anyone thanks to a reduced and clear structure. Instead of including too many characters and a lot of background information, the film focuses on a pitiless villain, a lonesome gun-slinging hero and an innocent child with special capacities.The movie managed to be balanced without ever being headless. It's an action movie because of the breathtaking fight scenes involving an incredibly cool Idris Elba and a cold and sinister Matthew McConaughey. It's a fantasy film because of the existence of different worlds and the possibility of travelling between them. It's a thriller because of the ruthless crimes the villain commits. It's a drama because it shows how the gunslinger struggles with his father's death and how the innocent child feels rejected by his family. It's a movie for teenagers because it's easy to identify with the sympathetic young loner but also for adults because the movie is surprisingly brutal and sinister at times.Add a constant gloomy atmosphere, a fitting soundtrack, great camera work without too many shaky camera sequences, imaginative visual special effects, interesting side characters such as the teenager's suspicious stepfather or the charming and intelligent seer as well as smart references to other works of Stephen King such as It and The Shining.In the end, I couldn't point out a negative element of this movie. The story itself might not be revolutionary and can basically be described as the eternal duel between good and evil but the story was written by Stephen King and not by the makers of this film. From the gripping acting over the diversified genre mixture and concise storytelling to the stunning sound and visual special effects, The Dark Tower convinces on every level. Most importantly, it's absolutely entertaining from start to finish, no matter if you're familiar with the novels or not.",The Dark Tower
61,dworldeater,Terrible,3,17 December 2017,"I never read the Steven King books which are the source material for this film. I did, however like what I saw in the trailer. I did not enjoy the film. I have seen this described as The Good, The Bad And The Ugly meets The Lord Of The Rings, but is more like Steven King's version of The Neverending Story with another very annoying little kid stinking it up as the lead. I am assuming if this was nothing like the source material and is a very clausterphobic, poorly flowing and very stupid fantasy action movie that fails to entertain or maintain a consistant tone. Matthew McConaughey is one of the lamest villans I have ever seen and should probably stick to those chick flicks he normally does, so he dosen't appear in a film project that I have any interest in again and I can ignore the fact that he exists. The shoot em' up action and The Gunslinger character is the only things about this movie I like. Idris Elba gave an excellent performance, I will have to check out more of his work, but The Dark Tower bites the big one and I will never watch this movie again.",The Dark Tower
62,s3276169,An abysmal failure......,3,9 September 2017,"I have read a good number of the Dark Tower series of books by Stephen King and I'd rate them as some of his very best work.I was then hugely excited and then quickly disappointed by the cinematic interpretation of King's work. The Dark Tower could best be described as the ""Coles Notes"" version of the books. Whilst Coles had their place summarizing often complex literary works for confused students, the abbreviated silver screen version of the Dark Tower series is disappointing. Worse still its unfaithful to the books. Roland Deschain, ""the Gunslinger"", indisputably the main character in the books is ""side lined"" in favor of an important but more marginal character, ""the boy"", Jake Chambers. Its a naff move that disrupts the focus and displaces the context of the story. The result is a film with a ""boys own"" feel. There are a few dark moments but they in no way capture the atmosphere of the original books which are dark, gritty and nihilistic, in a Clint Eastwood's, ""The Unforgiven"", on steroids kind of way. Idris Elba is a great casting choice for Roland but the role he is cast in provides limited opportunity for character development. Jake's character, the overlooked, unloved son of the books, fares little better. Suffice to say, the cinematic Dark Tower is, to my mind, a missed opportunity that seems unable to take advantage of the wonderful material on offer. Three out of ten from me.",The Dark Tower
63,Enchorde,Adventure for youth or action?,5,2 September 2018,"Young Jake is troubled by dreams of a mysterious alternative universe were a battle for the future of the galaxy takes place. Nobody believes his stories, he gets in trouble both at school and at home, but there are some mysterious earthquakes hinting that something is not allright.This quickly evolves to Jake being hunted by a black sorcerer, to be used in the sorcerers weapon because of his magic powers, so that the sorcerer can destroy the Dark Tower that protects the galaxy. We never learn why it is called the Dark Tower, what it really does, or who built it. Anyhow, Jake teams up with Roland. A gunslinger with some supernatural shooting abilities, formerly tasked with protecting the tower, now only on a quest for vengeance against the black sorcerer.As you see the background story given is thin, and never really explored or explained. The characters, except perhaps Jake, develop very little beyond the most obvious of reasons. In all, the plot and story telling is pretty close to what I expect from an adventure story for an audience of kids about Jake's age, perhaps ten to thirteen. It is quite simple, follows a very straight storyline with overly obvious motivations why. No subtle hints of deeper thoughts, nor surprises here.And that would have been fine, would I not be unsure that is the movie they intended to make. Because the movie is quite violent and brutal. Both good and bad characters are killing people at quite a high rate, and there is some gore too. Some fight scenes are quite good, and they do not hold anything back. So the story and and action scenes don't quite add up, they don't match each other.Unfortunately, that made me feel a bit disappointed. I had expected more of a movie with that cast and the origin of story (Stephen King) the movie had. It is not really that bad (I think many really low reviews and ratings come from disappointment), but it is not a movie to remember either. Could have been so much better.",The Dark Tower
64,TheFearmakers,Tower of No Power,1,4 August 2017,"Stephen King is both a popular, highly successful, bestselling author, and at the same time has a cult following: The latter derives from books like THE DARK TOWER... King's a rabid fan of fantasy, ranging from Narnia to the original pulpy Conan tales by Robert E. Howard, and this is his own fantastical world located in shrouded mystery far beyond ours, but not really: both locations take place on Earth, and the TOWER is what's holding our dimension together. And so, having not read the source, this review will be as short as possible, befitting what's the best thing about this adaptation...At a sparse 90-minute run-time, director Nikolaj Arcel packs in all the action-packed elements that seem more cliché than anything else. There's a master hero, who's called The Gunslinger; a young boy sent into this man's world to learn the ropes for to protect THE DARK TOWER; and last but not least, The Dark Man i.e. The Man in Black himself, mundanely named Walter...And while Matthew McConaughey usually brings something spontaneous and interesting to any role, here he simply struts around, a cocky, sinister hybrid of an unsuited Darth Vader and King's THE STAND TV-Miniseries' devil, Randall Flagg — an evil incarnate who looks like he'd shoot pool at the local tavern.The scenes that should have worked fall completely flat. Like Idris Elba's Gunslinger, Roland, venturing (more like sleepwalking) with the dull kid-actor from the purgatory realm into the bustling modern New York City. Neither our or their hemisphere provides more than a few shoot-outs and a ton of cornball dialogue. Meanwhile, several wizardly types remind the boy he's got a second-sight called... THE SHINING. Well if King detested Stanley Kubrick's classic 1980 adaptation, he should hate this dreary stroll in the dark. Probably not, though. After all, an anemic, lackluster film like this makes reading the book a must. (cultfilmfreaks.com)",The Dark Tower
65,AudioFileZ,With No Pre-Conceptions I Thoroughly Enjoyed The Dark Tower,8,16 August 2017,"The Dark Tower doesn't seem to be quite getting the rating this viewer thinks it deserves. Perhaps it's a luxury not being versed in the Stephen King novel? Coming into it with no prior knowledge may be good since I had no expectations. What I experienced was quite good Sci- Fi. It's a usual battle between good and bad in which the lines take a bit of time to sort out. Nothing is revealed too soon, but flows well. A child named Jake is the central figure and young Tom Taylor plays the part well indeed. In NYC he's pegged by his parents and his school as a gifted and troubled student. His trouble is he's seeing things no one around him can and it's really dark. The darkness is getting closer and it's actually crossing over as evidenced by earthquake like tremors that all in the city feel and fear. Jake knows it's something more and he is quite unsettled thus his troubles. It's an excellent setup for the convergence of different worlds and times through which Jake stumbles into a time and space portal. He is soon, through his unique gifts, brought together with ""The Gunslinger"" in a much different reality. The Gunslinger is bent on killing the central figure of all that is dark named Walter. Think of him as the devil who is attempting to destroy all worlds. Walter is played steely cold without any bombast by Matthew McConaughey. McConaughey brings a level of black evil that is palpable and we're not just talking about his black uniform. So we have a tight and focused excellent cast with Idris Elba as Roland The Gunslinger, Jake as the troubled gifted psychic child, and McConaughhey as their ultimate enemy.Why I feel the movie is really good is that no matter how it adapts the story, the story is realized very well. The movie seamlessly travels back and forth in time and worlds to create an ultimate battle between good and bad. Yes, it has some familiar western genre elements, but it doesn't try to be a western in the least. It just uses some familiar themes from them and creates a Sci- Fi- piece of it's own. The movie makes investment in the characters of Jake and The Gunslinger into ones the viewer gets behind very organically, not forced, but quite easily. It also makes the viewer detest Walter immediately just as well. What is so well done, I feel, is that the viewer never questions the segueing between the supernatural and the everyday world. You totally accept what is revealed in each scene. And there is little waste here in stringing it all as a whole. You get on board and your mind is taken on a ride. In spite of the current rather pedestrian rating of 6 as well as the divided critical views this is, IMHO, an excellent movie that keeps you rapt right until the final battle ensues. I give it an 8 and I think if you don't worry about a book adaptation, and you like Sci-Fi, you will be entertained from beginning to end.",The Dark Tower
66,jadepietro,Lost in the Dark,3,20 August 2017,"(RATING: ☆½ out of 5) GRADE: D+ THIS FILM IS NOT RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: A terrible movie with a terrible screenplay, terrible direction, and terrible villain...did I mention it was terrible?SYNOPSIS: The forces of Good battle the forces of Evil in this mishmash of genres.JIM'S REVIEW: The Dark Tower, a film based on Stephen King's series of eight novels... none of which I read...can now be seen on movie screens in America. And after seeing this film adaptation, I can firmly say that I made the right choice. I really disliked this movie. It is essentially a supernatural horror cowboy fantasy that is more exposition than story. Mixing these two genres never works. Remember, the god-awful movie, Cowboys and Aliens? The story, at least in this movie version (sadly, the beginning chapter of this soon-to-be film franchise), is so damn silly and unappealing. It couldn't round-up any scare or excitement, let alone one's interest in its overly convoluted, yet predictable plot. After fifteen minutes, I wanted to escape this hell. The film drones on and on...and it's barely 90 minutes long.The plot goes something like this: Jake (Tom Taylor) has a gift: he sees dead people and more. Protecting Jake from the evil force known as Walter, a.k.a. The Man in Black (Matthew McConaughey) is Roland (Idris Elba), the Gunslinger. They travel from Keystone Earth to another eerie world called Mid-World, the home of the Dark Tower, a ebony monolith that protects the world from chaos and death. (However, even before we begin, two questions are already problematic right from the start: 1. Why must a villain always wear black? and 2. With a name like Walter, who wouldn't be justifiably angry?)Did I say the movie was slow? The movie was mostly filler. The thrills were totally missing. The film seemed endless to me. Scenes were choppy and never build to any degree of excitement. Characters were stick figures caught up in a dumb story. CGI effects were barely adequate. Director Nikolaj Arcel wrote the screenplay along with Akiva Goldsman, Jeff Pinkner, and Anders Thomas Jensen, and all of them take equal blame here. There was no suspense none! What a disappointment!Mr. Arcel was given full director credit (or discredit, as I see it). Ron Howard was listed as the producer and, rumor has it, he needed to step in to save the movie... he didn't. And as I said before, the pace and rhythm of the film was off kilter. But I think most of the problem lies in the script and plot structure. The dialog was downright laughable too. The film's ""live by the gun / die by the gun"" message is so lame. And that maxim, ""He who kills with his gun has forgotten the face of his father. I kill with my heart."" That mantra is uttered numerous times ad nauseam. That silly phrase is in need of a rewrite: ""He who watches this movie has forgotten the time he has wasted.""And let's talk about the cast, shall we? As Jake, Mr, Taylor does a fine job, no qualms there. And Mr. Elba was perfectly cast, but Mr. McConaughey certainly wasn't. Mr. Elba gives a heartfelt performance, a hero one can root for, while Mr. McConaughey delivers one of the least menacing villains in cinema history. The real evil that he embodies is that of a slick metrosexual persona, a older man vainly clinging to his youth, wearing form-fitting tapered shirts and lathered with body treatment lotions, moisturizers, and bronze tanning solutions. The actor resembled most 80's Las Vegas magicians, truly a mix of Siegfried or Roy or David Copperfield. His powers of thought control over his victims looked like a bad hypnotist act. The only dead things he seemed more interested in controlling were the dead cells he must have removed with his many exfoliant treatments. This Academy Award winning actor's performance was, at times, unintentionally hilarious, and certainly not the proper nemesis. He created more laughs than tension, more comedy than drama.There's nothing more to add, except to say that The Dark Tower is dim-witted and deadly dull. One of the year's worst.

67,rgkarim,Towering Potential Collapses To Rushed Plot,6,3 August 2017,"Stephen King is a master of many things, and Hollywood has never been afraid to capitalize on the epic tales he has crafted over the years. This weekend his legendary Dark Tower series gets its own chance to ""shine"" and prove to fans that the series can continue on. Did Sony studios plan to make a ""sequel"" to the books thrive, or will if fall victim to the shortcuts the film industry often takes. Robbie K here to share his thoughts on another movie. Why don't we get started then?LIKES:Nice Set Up: Doing my research, I realized where the directors were planning on taking this film franchise and the books it is based on. The Dark Tower acts as a ""sequel"" to the books and builds as an introduction to the series. It sets a nice framework up for those who haven't read the series and prepares us for an adventure that could span multiple films/shows in the future. It has simplified the complexity of King's work and thrown hints at how his worlds are connected, perhaps inspiring some rewatching of his classics. Action Scene: Dark Tower primarily is about opening us up to a world and setting the pieces and that unfortunately doesn't bring much action. However, the group managed to put a dazzling piece together involving our gunslinger and a round of minions. Idris Elba finally gets to show off his legendary skills, outside of acting, as the lone gunslinger in his quest to stop the forces of evil. The stunts are epic, the editing is on point, and the violence is contained to not be overly gory but still strong enough to be considered action instead of a bland use of a gun. It took the movie long enough to get to this point, but I thoroughly enjoyed the climax fight. The Acting: I'm not calling this the world's best acting, or even Oscar Worthy on most levels, but the acting is decent in the Dark Tower. Tom Taylor as the new kid with the shine, does a decent job playing the troubled, awkward kid and portraying that strange view of the world. His other emotions, however, needs a little work as these come off dry, awkward, and sometimes a bit underwhelming given the circumstance. Matthew McConaughey brings his Lexus commercial approach to the mix, the cool delivery of his lines, holding an air of superiority and malicious intent. He has the villain role down and instills a bit of chill when he appears on the scene. Of course, the champion of this movie is Idris himself, hitting the role with 100% accuracy. Elba's got the rogue part down and the edgy, loner bravado brings the bang to the proverbial gun. And the chemistry Elba has with his cast only amps up his skills, a talent I always like to see. DISLIKES:Rushed: Sure the movie made a nice framework for introducing the series to nonreaders, it failed to deliver those important details. The Dark Tower leaves a lot questions unanswered in terms of the origins of all the pieces involved in this war. As for the parts they do fill in, these are lacking on so many levels, lacking real depth or mystery to get you hooked into the film. Even worse, much of the quest has little in regards to obstacles, with most problems being solved with little effort. You get to hear all about the things lying in wait, but their actual involvement in the movie is little to none. While this not only limits the story, it also limits the special effects and creature design we could have gotten as well. A few CGI and makeup effects stand out, but the Dark Tower's first film is rather lackluster given the potential of King's books. Anticlimactic: Much of the movie is rather dull, drawn out in a manner of theoretical talks of ideal brain power, anarchy, and abduction. All the fancy words and magic didn't help a limited dialog that can be boiled down into a single-minded set of plots that we hear over and over again. When things finally get going, and all the hot air from the cast is lit aflame the action barely catches light before being snuffed out. With the exception of one scene (see likes), The Dark Tower's gun slinging is not what I expected. This is particular true for the final fight between antagonist and protagonist that was more lame than impressive. All the hype and rivalry to end so abruptly, not the direction I would have taken. Predictable/Lazy: There was so much potential placed on this movie, and the trailer painted what could have been an epic adventure. Yet, somewhere the film fell victim to cheap shortcuts, low use of nightmarish effects, and a direction that went down the wrong tangent for an opening. It felt uninspired and lazy at times, and perhaps they cut a lot of good parts to fit into the short run time. The VERDICT:Overall the Dark Tower is not bad when you understand the plan to expand upon in the years to come. As a stand-alone film, it does the job of introducing characters and the world, but it failed to reel me into the full-on adventure. With a rushed plot, easy challenges, and lazy production approach, this film is mediocre at best given the hype of everything. Therefore, this reviewer recommends holding off seeing this film until Redbox gets it in stock. My scores:Action/Adventure/Fantasy: 6.5 Movie Overall: 6.0",The Dark Tower
68,Rob_Taylor,The Daft Tower,5,8 October 2017,"So, I tried to adjust my expectations going into this movie. I knew it would be nothing like the books - how could it be, at only 90 minutes? - but I hoped it would be more than the usual shallow adaptation that cherry picks names and places from epic novels and then tries to make a coherent film out of it.Big surprise, that is exactly what it is. A movie that has the unmitigated gall to claim it is ""based"" on a novel, while doing nothing more than picking a couple of characters and locations and throwing a trivial screenplay together to con people out of their money.The Dark Tower novels are a long, deeply involved set of books in which character arcs and dynamics are front and centre. It is, at its most basic, the well-trodden Hero's Journey motif. However, the deep plotting and fantastic locations, along with the aforementioned character development, make it a very worthwhile set of novels to read.The Dark Tower movie, by contrast, does away with all but two of the main characters. Then it trivialises their backstories and turns the entire plot into an excuse for a truly lame final shootout. None of the subtlety or nuance has been retained. It is as if the screenwriters took the first and last pages of the novels and used that as the basis for the screenplay.Gone is the racial dynamic between Roland and Detta (because Detta, the alter-ego of Susannah), and Susannah herself, are both left out of the movie. So too is Eddie Dean, Oy, Blaine and most of the interesting locations featured in the novels.Look, I get that adapting such a monstrously huge work is hard. I really do. But to take something as complex and involved as the Dark Tower series and reduce it to a ninety minute shoot-fest is little short of insulting. Imagine if they remade Lord of the Rings and cut out all the characters except Aragorn and Frodo and you'll get the level of butchery done here.So, is it any good as a stand-alone movie if you know nothing of the Dark Tower novels? Well, I suppose it is passable. But it is very trivial and light, even then. The very definition of a disposable movie that you will forget shortly after watching.Acting is decent, with Elba doing a good turn as the stoic Roland. I even felt the young actor playing Jake did well. Matthew McConnaghy....not so much. There is a tendency in Hollywood to turn any villain character into a caricature and this performance was no exception. It was more understated than most such roles, but still came across as a bit laughable and over-the-top.As for effects... plenty of gun-kata style shenanigans on display. A little too many, if I'm honest. In the books, Roland is a consummate shot, able to shoot and reload and rarely, if ever, miss. In the movie, he exhibits an almost supernatural ability with a gun (especially at the end) that is, like McConnaghy's villain performance, just a little too much to swallow.The final gun battle is also plagued by a lack of imagination. There isn't anything like the imagination that went into say, the choreography of John Wick's combat or, if you remember it, even the precise motions of Equilibrium's gun kata. It's just poor old Idris running around, shooting people and never missing.Nor do I like the rather obvious lack of continuity in regards to character knowledge. At one point, having travelled to New York, Roland has to have a soda can explained to him. That's fine...he's not from Earth, so he doesn't know much about our culture. What is not fine is when, in the final gun battle, he seems to know exactly what a propane cylinder is and that it will explode if shot. I don't recall Jake explaining that to him, yet somehow he knew.Overall, the movie was a disappointment to me. They could have done so much more but, let's face it, cinema isn't the medium for such massive epics. A decent TV series could do it justice, but not a single movie. And yes, it will be a single movie, because I can't see people hammering on the studio doors demanding a sequel to this film.SUMMARY: Very weak sauce effort. Ninety percent of the story and characters missing. Not much like the books. In short, a typical Stephen King adaptation. Best avoided.",The Dark Tower
69,Matt_Layden,"Generic action sequences, oversimplification of an epic story and shoddy effects are just some of the problems....",4,3 August 2017,"This film, which was inspired, not adapted from the Stephen King novels of the same name, takes a sweeping epic, dumbs it down, loses the focus and lazily tries to make it look cool for a younger audience. This film is bad and I went in with an open mind, hoping to find some redeeming qualities about it. While there are some good ideas, I can't help but feel that this will be somewhat heartbreaking for fans of the books who were actually excited to see it. Jake Chambers is a young boy who suffers from horrific nightmares. In those nightmares, he sees The Man in Black, who kidnaps children and uses a device to suck their minds right out of their head. All in an effort to destroy the Dark Tower. The Dark Tower is the centre of the universe, protecting all worlds from the evil that lies beyond, out in the darkness. Roland, the last of the Gunslingers, soldiers sworn to protect the tower, is on a mission to kill The Man in Black. When Jake discovers a portal that leads to their world, he jumps in and finds Roland. Together they must stop The Man in Black, or their world and all worlds, will end. I couldn't help but think to myself, that people would never want to see a film that was loosely inspired by The Lord of the Rings. They would much rather see that literary masterpiece adapted to the big screen. Imagine Peter Jackson used the same characters and made a different story, but still slapped the title on it? So I can't help but wonder why they thought it would be a good idea to loosely adapt The Dark Tower and not do a straight adaption from the books. I kind of get the idea they were going for, in regards to how the book series ends, but they missed the mark and by a wide margin. I'm sure fans of the series would pick up numerous nods to the books here and there, but that is not enough. Graffiti on the wall of Hailing The Crimson King will get a knowing nod from people, but that's it. I'm sure they would rather see the actual story from the books on the screen. Arcel and writer Goldsman, oversimplify an epic story into a 90 some odd minute shoot em up. Sure, it looks cool when Elba reloads his guns, but I want something more than that. It doesn't help that the film essentially has two and a half action sequences, which might look neat to those who haven't seen a film like John Wick. Elba does his best with the clunky dialogue, but he can't save it. McConaughey chews up the scenery, as expected. His character is ""worse than the devil"". He can kill people by simply telling them to stop breathing. He does this numerous times. He can catch bullets, incinerate people, basically force anyone to do anything. Mucho powerful. But here's the expository dialogue part ""Roland, you've always been immune to my magic, haven't you?"" So there you have it, he can't hurt our hero in the ""stop breathing"" category. He can still use the force to hurl objects at him and watching McConaughey move his hands around to control items like broken glass or rocks is unintentionally comical. Bad special effects plague this film. There is a sequence at night where a demon, which apparently breaks through the barrier, attacks Roland and Jake. It's hard to make out what it looks like, or what the heck is going on. But in the end does it matter? Who know the Gunslinger will eventually put it out of its misery. I snickered at seeing how bad they rendered humans falling around or getting hit by cars. It only happens a few times in one particular sequences, but it's something that still hasn't been perfected and probably never will. The entire film feels clunky, unexplained or unexplored. I never got a sense of Roland's world. There are abandoned structures all over and they have no idea what they were used for, but we clearly know they are carnival rides, as does Jake. How does anyone who never read the books have a clue as to what this means. Arcel seems uninterested in exploring that side of the story and instead streamlines it from point A to point B. This isn't a story to do that, especially if the goal is to branch it off into a series. I suspect this will be the only film they make. With generic action sequences, oversimplification of an epic story, shoddy effects and some questionable performances (Jake's friend is the biggest offender), The Dark Tower is a big missed opportunity. Here is a series that could have been several films, sweeping multiple genres and taking viewers on a ride they probably wouldn't of forgotten. Instead we get this film that I already have forgotten. Ho-hum, despite a big budget, we have yet another King adaption failure.",The Dark Tower

71,bkrauser-81-311064,Not the Worst Stephen King Adaptation...but Still,6,19 August 2017,"Okay, so it's not as bad as people have made it out to be. It's not particularly good – the reactions of its intended audience i.e. Stephen King fans will definitely range between collective shrieks to outright foaming-at-the-mouth rage. But as someone who saw countless book shelves straining under the weight of The Dark Tower tomes and said, ""No thank you,"" I'm going to give it the softest of soft passes.I know, I know, call it a case of ugly duckling syndrome. If someone walked up to me on the street and said, ""No this movie is trash,"" I probably wouldn't argue. But there's no denying that at its lowest level, The Dark Tower is an average looking pastiche of fantasy adventure clichés, incongruous sci-fi minutia and circle jerking Stephen King iconography thrown in for good measure. That, plus Matthew McConaughey playing a black-clad wizard named Walter, what's not to love? Part of the problem may stem from the perception of Stephen King himself. When his movie adaptations are good, they're really good and when they're bad they're laughably bad. The Dark Tower is neither, balancing its modest goals, maximizing the rare moments of ""coolness"" and almost endearingly hiding its more embarrassing bits by hacking the movie to s**t.Walter (giggle), is a self-described black wizard who tries and fails on a near constant basis to topple the Dark Tower sitting at the center of the universe. Without it; creepy ghoulies and otherworldly monsters threaten to invade the universe and engulf all its living souls in a millennia of fire, brimstone and other such gobbly-gook. The only ones standing in his way are Roland Deschain (Elba), the last of the Gunslingers and Jake (Taylor), a New York tween with untapped psychic abilities.Right off the bat, the film fights its internally bizarre setup with the soulless story-beats of a below average blockbuster; the type that takes itself way too seriously. The eerie midnight walks through forests and chase scenes through sci-fi frontier villages, conjures memories of this year's The Mummy (2017) in its level of flavorlessness. Then there are the visuals, which much like the disjointed narrative are function only. They work when they need to such as during the pistol slinging money-shots but otherwise the art direction looks like something out of Stargate: Atlantis (2004-2009).In case it wasn't obvious, Matthew McConaughey is sorely miscast as our villain. His every move and utterance comes across less like the words and mannerisms of a nefarious demon but more of a hissing sidekick to the big baddie. His attempts to be anything but, fall hilariously flat such as when he orders unquestioning servants around or when he torments the Gunslinger with mindless dribble.Idris Elba manages to do much better in making the Gunslinger, likable, vulnerable, resourceful and occasionally fun. That said; because he's relegated to being a sidekick to a Bastian-like siphon in the form of Tom Taylor, Elba is never given much of a chance to really explore the character. He's basically used throughout the movie as an all-purpose tool. Every time something dire happens, the Gunslinger is there. Need food, the Gunslinger can cook it. Need to resolve your deep-seeded daddy issues in seventy minutes flat? Get yourself the Gunslinger 5000.With all that said, The Dark Tower isn't strictly speaking a chore to sit through. When the plot inevitably brings our heroes back to New York City, the film lightens its tone a little to resemble the best aspects of Last Action Hero (1993). The action, while clumsy, does speed through at a decent clip and the exposition never feels so forced as to be cumbersome. Additionally director Nikolaj Arcel does seem to have a desire to explore Stephen King's sprawling mythology even if the movie's obvious lack of studio support stops him from turning in anything other than a cheap, empty husk of a movie.As far as quality, The Dark Tower is somewhere in-between Cat's Eye (1985) and Children of the Corn III (1995) as far as Stephen King adaptations go. It's definitely not good enough to be among his best but it's not so laughably bad as to warrant its own drinking game (looking at you Sleepwalkers). Sadly I have no words of comfort for true blue King fans lest to say that if you think The Dark Tower is a disappointment you probably shouldn't watch Dreamcatcher (2001). I've seen the bottom of the barrel folks, this one ain't all that.",The Dark Tower
72,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"""The Dark Tower""- Savaged by critics. Dismissed by fans. Ignored by general audiences. And yet... I kinda liked it.",7,17 August 2017,"In a summer filled with under-performing and inconsistent quality films, one particular release has emerged and stands tall as perhaps the most debated and ridiculed movie of the year. That being director Nikolaj Arcel's ""The Dark Tower"", inspired by the novels of legendary acclaimed author Stephen King. It's a project that's spent a great deal of time in development, with numerous writers, directors and producers all attached to the adaptation at different times. Frankly, I'm shocked the film even ended up being released. It's been one of those movies you'd hear about constantly over the past ten years, and yet nothing ever seemed to come together. Until now.Unfortunately, the film that was released has been completely and utterly destroyed by both critics and audiences alike. It's rare to see a film that so many people seem to just love to hate. Fans of the books weren't happy due to its short run-time, PG-13 rating and a cast that didn't really seem to match up with what was described in the original stories. Critics disliked it for having a quick pace and for finding the plot too confusing. And general audiences don't seem to care in the slightest, dismissing the movie as nothing more than just another generic summer release. ""The Dark Tower""... it just can't catch a break. Which is a shame, because I went in with an open mind and a determination not to judge the film by what I'd heard, nor compare it to what I know of the source material......and I actually had a pretty good time with it! Sure, it won't win any awards, but this is one of those situations where I simply cannot wrap my head around the rampant and unending hatred. The story is easy to understand and has just enough twists and turns to keep you invested. The performances are very good, and everyone seems really invested in their characters for the most part. And the sharp visual direction and frequent action set-pieces give the film a lot of life. So long as you can accept the fact that the film is more ""inspired by"" than ""based upon"" the books, there's a lot more to like here than most people are willing to admit.At the center of the known universe exists a fabled and mysterious Dark Tower- a structure whose power somehow protects the balance between the darkness and the light. Should the tower fall, evil forces from beyond our reality will be able to cross over, leading to the destruction of all existence. A devious sorcerer known as the ""Man in Black"" (Matthew McConaughey) is seeking to destroy the Tower for his own dark reasons, and in order to do so, he must kidnap and collect children from all the different worlds of the universe- for it is told that the only thing that can destroy the Tower is the mind of a child. In modern- day New York City, a young boy named Jake Chambers (Tom Taylor) is plagued by dreams of the Dark Tower and the Man in Black, and becomes convinced they must be real. Jake eventually comes to learn that like the children the Man in Black has collected, he possesses psychic abilities that make him a prime target- powers known as the ""Shine."" And thus, Jake must team up with Roland (Idris Elba), a haunted and disgraced gunslinger from a faraway world who had also appeared in his dreams, to solve the mystery of the Man in Black's scheme and put an end to his deadly and apocalyptic plans...The highlights of the film are most certainly the characters of Roland and Jake, whom serve as our two leads in the story. Elba, though an unconventional choice for the part of Roland, commands the screen with his presence, and injects a lot of really great pathos into the part. Roland has lived a tragic life, and is seeking retribution and salvation, and Elba perfectly conveys this in a fantastic role. And he's definitely the best actor in the film. I also really liked a few subtle scenes that show Roland and Jake forming a sort-of surrogate father and son relationship. Though unfortunately these scenes are limited and go by a bit too quickly, they provide the emotional heart of the film, and child actor Tom Taylor is consistently very good. The only actor who might be a bit miscast is McConaughey. It's not that he's bad- he's fairly decent and an adequate villain, and you get the feeling he's having fun with the part... but his choices for the role are a bit dubious at times.I also very much admired the fantastic production quality and top- notch visual direction courtesy Arcel. This is a very slick and very well-made movie, all things considered, and it's clear a lot of effort has been put into it. Even though it has a relatively middling budget of only $60 million, the movie looks like it cost at least twice that, and they get some great results. If I were to complain about anything, though, it's that the pace is quite messy and the film oftentimes lacks focus. It rushes a bit too much for its own good, and the characters and story do suffer for it. And it is a pretty glaring, obvious fault that I can't ignore.Still, if you can go in with an open mind, I'd definitely recommend giving ""The Dark Tower"" a shot. Too many people are falling for the mob-mentality of hate that plagues just about every single new film that comes out, and it's not getting the fair chance it deserves. I know I had a ton of fun with it, and I'm glad I gave it a shot. For me, it's a very solid 7 out of 10.",The Dark Tower

Starring Tom Taylor, Idris Elba, Matthew McConaughey, Claudia Kim, Katheryn Winnick, Fran Kranz, Abbey Lee, Jackie Earle Haley, Eva Kaminsky, Dennis Haysbert. (PG-13)Misbegotten adaptation (barely at that) of Stephen King's epic series of novels about a boy and his gunslinger battling the forces of evil in both the real world and a fantasy dimension called Mid-World. Skims over the dense plot and mythology to carry the audience from one poorly-shaped, perfunctory scene to the next, rarely pausing between exposition dumps to give anyone reason to care; there's enough stuff in the source books for an entire season of television, but what little that's been carried over has been crammed into about 90 minutes. Rarely makes sense beyond basic good vs. evil gobbledigook; Elba emerges unscathed (and saves some of his scenes purely with his screen presence), McConaughey is pretty bad (but sometimes entertainingly so), Taylor is worse (not entertainingly so). Difficult to say what's crummier: the conceptualization or execution; it's rarely painful (unless you love the books and had high hopes) but its mechanical motions are so lacking in character or vivacity that there's no reason to even watch it--a nap will do just fine instead.26/100",The Dark Tower

75,Abdulxoxo,Don't know about the source material but this is a decent flick,6,4 February 2021,"The Dark Tower isn't the easiest film in the world to understand. The main plot isn't too bad to get to grips with. There are some complex storylines going on and some interesting characters. Unfortunately those characters (Walter in particular) weren't fleshed out enough. I would have liked to have found out Walter's motivations for wanting the tower destroyed or why he was so evil. The story seemed rushed with so many things being left unexplained or briefly touched upon. At a mere 95 minutes it felt long but still felt short considering all the things it was trying to do. There were a lot of things to enjoy about this film however. Firstly the performances. For his first film role Tom Taylor did really well. He showed range in what wasn't an easy part to play. Elba was, as always, smooth. His relationship with Taylor was a highlight. There was also some humour in there when each of them went to the other's world/dimension. McConaughey's role was usual to begin with but it wouldn't take long to get used to it and to some extent he's somewhat likable. Some of the action scenes were good. There were also moments where there was good use of special effects. The art design was also quite nice at points. Overall, a decent enjoyable movie.",The Dark Tower

The books create a dark, fantastical world with lots of interesting elements that have spilt across two realities that is both mysterious, yet partially recognisable.Now someone had the bright idea of condensing all of these books into a short, relatively low budget, movie.
It is not good.On its own this film is a rather dull action film with some cool aliens in it.
If this did not have the Dark Tower name attached to it I would never have watched it.
It can not hope to encompass the details in the book so it just pays lip service by using some quoted words and taking the very bare minimum of character attributes.I.E the Gun Slinger says stuff about the face of his father, wears a hat and has a gun.
Even Idris Elba cannot breathe life into this because as he obviously has no idea why his character is coming out with all this random crap.If you read the books stay well away from this.

Then there's a kid in the here-and-now who has dreams about the gunslinger and his mortal enemy, a guy named Walter, who wears a black coat just in case you wonder if he's good or bad.

81,one9eighty,A Sci-Fi Fantasy Western with a heart,7,13 February 2018,"The Dark Tower brings to screen one of Stephen King's most acclaimed novels. There have been a lot of King adaptations over the years and not all of them have been met by critical with positives from reviewers. Dark Tower stands apart from them, and at times I wouldn't recognise this against other adaptations if I were to encounter them in a line up. Some purists will probably hate this as King's ""Dark Tower"" spans 7 books and here you have a lot all condensed into a single movie. I had to think to myself, would this be as pacey as it was if it had been split into follow-on films like Tolkien films have been, the answer is probably not. There was enough for movie goers to get stuck into and follow rather than having two films of character development and then one film of action to conclude. This is a futuristic sci-fi fantasy western with occasional steam punk visuals which shows a fight between good and evil and the potential for a universal collapse. McConaughey plays Walter Padick, the man in black, destined to bring down the universe and opposing him is Tom Taylor as Jake Chambers a gifted child, and Edris Elba as Roland Descain, the gunslinger - charged with protecting what's left of goodness in existence. Fan of the book or not it's easy to follow the story and its well delivered by all involved. The world is both stunning and derelict both in the real world and the other worlds that are explored. It was nice to see how similar and run down places can be whether they are in a desert or in a city scape. Fans of King will probably be able to draw in connections to other film's to attempt to make a literary universe - an example being the gift that Chambers has is referred to as a 'shine' much like Danny has the 'shining' in Kubrick adaptation of ""The Shining"". Without going into detail and analysing every detail for fear of writing spoilers and ruining somebody's viewing pleasure - I'll just say this film isn't as bad as critics said it was. It seems that these day's critics slate every film that comes out without giving it a chance. They appear to be waiting for the next big genre defying masterpiece and dismissing good old fashioned films which tell a story and look good. This is one of those films, it's not going to set the world alight, but it certainly does suspend disbelief enough to ensure that you haven't wasted 90+minutes of your life. Dark Tower, you get a 7 out of 10 from me. :)",The Dark Tower
82,RforFilm,"After years in development, The Dark Tower is an incredibly...okay movie that will disappoint fans of the book series",5,8 August 2017,"Looks like we've got another Stephen King adaptation, so let's talk about him. King remains one of the most iconic and best writers today, penning some great horror stories like Misery, The Shining, Cujo, and Carrie. He's gone outside of the horror genre with The Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile. Though if you were to ask any hardcore king fan what they think is his masterpiece, then most would say The Dark Tower. It's said that this is a combination of Lord of the Rings-style fantasy with western tropes like having a quiet gunman as the hero and a cowboy as the savior.It also seems to tap into the idea that our dreams could be visions of another world. As kids, we're always coming up with interesting characters and ways to play. I can't count how many times that I had my doodles confiscated by my teacher, each with their own personality and backstory. I may have not placed it on paper, but the stories were played out in my mind. Our main character is also a child who sees images of cowboys and sorcerers in his dreams. Let's see if The Dark Tower can finally bring this popular novel to life. Young boy Jake Chambers (played by Tom Taylor) is an outcast from his mother and step father and his peers as he's saying that he's having constant dreams about a ""gunslinger"" and ""the man in black"". His parents dismiss this to a reaction to his father's death in a fire and have him go to therapy sessions to resolve this. After escaping a group of people that want to take him to a facility upstate (it turned out they were creatures from another world), he tracks down a house that was also a frequent vision. After fighting the ""evil house demon"", he enters a teleportor that takes him to a new world.When Jake takes a drink from a canteen, the gunslinger (played by Idris Elba) demands to know who he is. Jakes explains his visions and even gives him one of his own drawings for proof. The gunslinger then talks about how the dark tower that is seen the most by the kid is what holds the universe and the parallel worlds together and that ""the man in black"" Walter Padick (played by Matthew McConaughey) is trying to take it down. Walter is trying to get to Jake while the Gunslinger remains his protector while looking to defeat ""the man in black"".I'm fully aware that The Dark Tower had been in back burner for Hollywood for years and went through several idea people like J.J. Abrams and Ron Howard. The final product is disappointing as I see a lot of potential for this to become a franchise, only for it to come out verystandard. I get the feeling that the movie was originally a lot longer, as the short hour and a half running time seems to rush through one scene after another. It's edited alright, but I want to see what got cut out.The story isn't as complex as you'd expect, but it never feels as big and grand as it wants to. I think a lot of that has to do with the fact that this movie takes itself a tad too seriously. In fact, one of the films highlights is Matthew McConaughey who put's a lot of ham into his performance, making him goofy, but intimidating. He steels each scene, so whenever the movie cuts from him, I'm simply waiting for him to come back. Idris Elba, a normally good performer, is very dull as the gunslinger. It simply was not good casting (I could have seen a Stallone or Dwayne Johnson pull this material better).I get the feeling that book fans are going to be irritated by this adaptation, but typical moviegoers may find a bit more. It's not to say that this is a good movie, but it is short and it does fine on the action. The Dark Tower seems to be standing in an odd place: somewhere between a grand universe and an all too safe studio trying to make it appeal to everyone. This clearly should have been an HBO or Netflix miniseries rather then a movie.I'll give this five dark towers out of ten. I'll say that if you're a fan of The Dark Tower book series, this'll probably anger you. Everyone else shouldn't have much of an issue. It's just that with better Stephen King movies out there that have a lot more weight and entertainment. This is no magnum opus of the author, but it should provide enough action for a rainy Saturday on TV.",The Dark Tower

84,petra_ste,How to turn a 4000+ pages saga into a 90 minutes movie,4,14 October 2017,"Full disclosure: I usually enjoy Stephen King but I am not a Dark Tower fan. I loved The Gunslinger but got increasingly disillusioned with the series as it went on. Therefore, when I say this film is awful, I rate it considering its own merits (or lack thereof) and not its (nonexistent) faithfulness to the source material ... although it needs to be said: trying to squeeze eight books into a single 90 minutes film is a recipe for storytelling disaster.It's a problem of genre. Action movies, for example, can cut to the chase and keep running. However, fantasy, horror and science fiction (and The Dark Tower has elements of all three) are trickier, because suspension of disbelief is more fragile there. You need to take your time, set up the world, rules and lore, let the audience soak in the sense of wonder.The Dark Tower has none of this. Imagine The Lord of the Rings told not as a sprawling fantasy epic but with the narrative beats and pacing of your average action-thriller.Nikolaj Arcel's film rushes through its outlandish plot of parallel universes, eldritch buildings, demonic warlocks, gunslinging paladins, kids with ESP powers, and so on. The novels, for all their flaws, did lay out the groundwork, map the world-building, ratchet up the tension and stakes, with King's storytelling flair mostly holding together that particular string of nonsense. When the movie started and Flagg was strolling around his Evil Base smugly dissing his rat-faced minions, like Commander Cobra cosplaying Skeletor, I knew I was in for a shower of manure.A smarter adaptation would have tackled just the first book and its straightforward quest: think ""Sergio Leone meets The Fellowship of the Ring"". The Dark Tower just vomits all the series up in garbled, barely recognizable form, like some cretin on the bus loudly trying to sum up seven seasons of Game of Thrones in under two minutes for his dudebro pals.Also, this is a pet peeve of mine but it always irks me when a story teases an exotic fantasy world but then moves its characters to a boring modern day setting.The usually reliable McConaughey disappoints as the Man in Black in a grandstanding, obvious performance; Elba is OK but wasted as the stoic Gunslinger. Set-pieces are lackluster.The usual caveat for this kind of stuff is ""for fans only"", but a Dark Tower super-fan may react to this it worse than a casual moviegoer... and I can't see the latter particularly liking it, either.4/10",The Dark Tower

For what reason, I don't really know why and I don't know who these creatures are who are helping him and what are the powers of these players and their minions.  There are snippets of some things that are interesting, but they are brushed aside quickly for more battles between the two leads - battles that meant little.Letter Grade:  C5 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",The Dark Tower

89,dave-mcclain,"""The Dark Tower"" is an interesting but incomplete adaptation.",5,4 August 2017,"After decades of building a fan base, leading to much discussion of a feature film, 2017 finally brings Movie Fans ""The Dark Tower"" (PG-13, 1:35), a big screen version of Stephen King's series of novels. The prolific author published nine ""Dark Tower"" books from 1982 through 2012 (counting the 1998 prequel and the 2012 mid-series addition). King himself has called the series his magnum opus. It's a fitting phrase, not just for the scope and epic nature of the series, but also for its relationship to his other literary creations. Wikipedia sums it up this way: ""The series has become a linchpin that ties together much of King's body of work. The worlds of The Dark Tower are in part composed of locations, characters, events and other various elements from many of King's novels and short stories. Some of the books that are tied to this series, or that this series references are It, The Stand, 'Salem's Lot, Insomnia, and Hearts In Atlantis."" In regard to the film, I would add ""The Shining"" to that list, given its focus on psychic abilities. Both the book series and the film are somewhat genre-defying, including elements of fantasy, science fiction, action, adventure, drama and, of course, horror. Besides King's books and the film, ""The Dark Tower"" has also inspired companion books, comics series and an online game. Given all the fans that these ""Dark Tower"" incarnations created, not to mention the long wait for a cinematic adaptation, any film would arrive with high expectations. Too bad this one doesn't quite live up them. Jake Chambers (Tom Taylor) is a special boy. But his mother, Laurie (Katheryn Winnick), would describe him as ""troubled"". Jake has visions. Dark visions. But he has them at night, so his mother simply refers to them as dreams and thinks they're caused by his fireman father's tragic death. Laurie's trying to get Jake the psychological help she believes he needs. Jake is convinced his visions are of real things and he finds them very disturbing. He tries to work through his emotional discomfort by sketching his visions, pinning the drawings to the bulletin board in his room and staring at them, trying to figure out what they mean. He sees a very tall dark stone tower surrounded by clouds. He doesn't understand it yet, but he can tell it's very important. There's a villainous character called ""The Man in Black"" who kidnaps children, straps them into something that looks like a souped-up dentist's chair and then harnesses and projects their pure psychic energy through space and time, breaking pieces off of the dark tower. And there's a gunslinger who looks like someone straight out of the Old West and who is trying to stop the Man in Black. The Man in Black has working for him human-like creatures with an outer fake human skin, plus a mysterious old house and, over and over again, the numbers ""19-19"". But what does it all MEAN? Jake is able to follow the clues and find his way to another dimension, to a place called Mid-World, where the Man in Black and the Gunslinger both live. In this barren wasteland, Jake runs into the Gunslinger, who is at first very suspicious of the mysterious teen. Jake recognizes the Old West-style knight in black leather ""armor"" and tells him about those visions of his. The Gunslinger sees one of the drawings, recognizes the image of the Man in Black and is very interested in the other images in that drawing. The Gunslinger is still apprehensive about Jake, but the two work together to try and get to the Man in Black, gradually warming up to each other during their journey. Jake learns that the Dark Tower is an energy source at the center of the universe that keeps the forces of evil from destroying civilizations throughout the cosmos. He also learns that the Gunslinger has more on his mind these days than simply protecting the Dark Tower. Meanwhile, the Man in Black learns of Jake's existence and his psychic abilities, an especially strong ""Shine"" which could finally help destroy the Dark Tower.""The Dark Tower"" relies too much on knowledge of the books. It explains some things, but too much is unexplained, leaving the uninitiated at a loss. This book adaptation is unusual in that it isn't just a screen version of the novels, but is a sequel to the books, a continuation of the saga, with parts of the books included to make the story more accessible, but it's simply not enough (and the film's lean run time allows for more). In short, director and co- writer Nikolaj Arcel (""A Royal Affair"") gives us an interesting, but incomplete fantasy action-adventure. With a strong focus on the character of Jake, no sexual content, very little adult language and mostly bloodless violence, the film seems aimed at the YA crowd more than the books are. It plays like a mash-up of the Harry Potter films and TV's ""Game of Thrones"", but isn't as satisfying as either. Tom Taylor's Jake can best be described as adequate, while Idris Elba's flawed but ultimately heroic Gunslinger and Matthew McConaughey's gleefully evil Man in Black make for excellent adversaries and make their battle of good vs. evil eminently watchable. The film as a whole is entertaining enough for a mild recommendation but it could've and should've been better. ""B-""",The Dark Tower
90,MihaiSorinToma,An average movie with a great idea,7,6 September 2017,"In an universe where multiple worlds existed, held together and protected from darkness by a dark tower which has been standing from the beginning of time, the last Gunslinger tries to protect it with his last forces from the Man in Black who's determined to take it down. Together with a child with psychic powers, the gunslinger must have one last attempt to eliminate the dark ruler while the tower is still standing.It's a movie which presents an interesting universe, filled with weird creatures and people where the equilibrium between light and dark is held by a dark tower. While very well played by the actors, the main characters are not very complex, or at least not very well described, although their vast experience would have demanded such. Thus, we are faced with a revengeful master of guns, who seeks to kill the one who killed all his beloved, while eluding his duties as a Gunslinger. Unwillingly helped by a kid who dreamt him quite a lot, who possesses a couple of psychic powers, he will ultimately engage in a life and death battle which will decide the fate of the world. Opposed to the good guys, the Man in Black is much better presented, making his character (thanks to a great actor) much more credible and even fearful.The plot, although it promised a lot from the trailer, is pretty linear, without anything spectacular or at least a twist which might make it worthy of the unique places in which it enrolls. The beginning of the movie raises the interest with the presentations, but it suddenly drops into mediocrity, being a bit too predictable for my taste. I have to say, and I believe it's the first time I say this about a movie, that it is way too short. It had so much more to present both in terms of characters but also in terms of action. The shooting scenes are a true delight but are too seldom, making you lust for much more which unfortunately doesn't come. The finale is good in terms of implementation and idea, but it's also very predictable and much too sudden, leaving also a lot to ask for.Overall, it leaves an unpleasant sensation of superficiality, like the producers ran out of money or ideas and decided to end it way too soon. It has some good actors, great locations and intense action/shooting sequences which could have been a lot more exploited. I honestly wanted more from this movie, I wanted it to offer more but it ended up being too short to provide a strong plot and truly complex characters which would have made it a great movie. As it is, it's unfortunately another average movie which failed to deliver a great implementation from a great idea.",The Dark Tower
91,swilliky,Poorly executed fantasy adaptation,4,5 August 2017,"I went into this movie with very low expectations already skeptical after the trailers and even more so after the bad reviews. The Dark Tower is a rough and cheesy fantasy film that is typical of the genre. The odd world-building and strange dialogue did not benefit from two veteran actors and source material from one of the most popular authors in the world. I read that the film attempted to be a sequel to the long series and a starting point for new viewers but the early box office results do not show the books' popularity and PG-13 rating are helping. The film makes some strange choices mainly focusing on the child actor instead of the big names and skimping on the action advertised. The Dark Tower will most likely be a false start for what was anticipated to be the start of an extended universe of television and films.Jake Chambers (Tom Taylor) has strange dreams of a man in black (Matthew McConaughey) using children to create a weapon and attack a tower. With the death of Jake's father, his mother Laurie (Katheryn Winnick) seeks psychological help for Jake and at the urging of her new husband, she plans to send Jake to a special clinic. Jake realizes that the operators of this clinic are the strange creature wearing human face to blend in. He escapes and seeks out a building from his dreams. This building contains a portal that transports him to another dimension known as Mid-World where he meets the Gunslinger Roland Deschain (Idris Elba). Jake tells Roland about his dream and together they seek the man in black's lair, mentioning that the man in black is named Walter.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com",The Dark Tower
92,markthomassintek,Good family entertainment especially for the kids but as adult give it a miss.,7,18 August 2017,"REVIEW - THE DARK TOWER Well that was the interesting 90minutes watching the dark tower written by Stephen King.My biggest problem with films is that they show the best bits in the trailers as with war for the planet of the apes but of course when you're watching the trailer you think that's the rest of film has even better bits until you go to see it and realise that you have seen the best bits in the trailer.Unfortunately that is what is happened with this film. Being written by Steven king i thought this film would be another one of his amazing imaginative stories but honestly this story is a rather simple one. Don't get me wrong the film is enjoyable if you are 12 years old and the kids probably will love it but as adult myself i just felt that the first hour of the film was wasted on a very poor back story which could have easily been awesome if the sample.............So yes going to see it take the kids and it will keep them quiet 90 minutes wait for it to come on TV and watch it as a family when nothing else is on.Good family entertainment especially for the kids but as adult give it a miss.I will say this, Idris American accent has improved since Bastille Day! Rating 7 out of 10",The Dark Tower
93,pietclausen,Surprisingly good old fashioned entertainment,8,10 October 2017,"Reading the best reviews, there are many viewers saying this film is bad or worse. This is one of those times that I disagree vigorously with their ratings.I found the story most enjoyable, keeping one hooked to the screen and spellbound for an hour and a half. One must realize that this film is an adventure in fantasy world and it did succeed admirably in this genre. On top of it totally devoid of sex (hooray!), which nowadays is found in all movies for young and old, making its absence an excellent family movie.If you are looking for a solid entertaining movie with an original story (with some influence of Stephen King's writings) you can't go wrong watching this film. I rate this a sound 8 out of 10, much higher than the 5.9 presently computed from 32,299 submissions. The true value is probably closer to 7 plus!",The Dark Tower
94,kuarinofu,Unexpectedly shallow and empty,5,7 August 2017,"I haven't read any of the S.King's books from this series. I went to see this open-minded even though I heard many people complain about the main character not being portrayed as he was in the book (iYkwIm). This felt extremely poorly written and misdirected. Everything was cluttered, the production seemed uninspired at best. I expected this to be story driven and even a little boring and philosophic, with solid characters (which S.King can deliver).And it came out as the exact opposite. Rushed, unoriginal, grounded, the final scene of the movie came so fast I was baffled, I couldn't believe this was the end.To be completely fair - the only thing I enjoyed was the acting. Interesting to see that even such a poor script can get carried by amazing actors like Elba and McConaughey. If not for their performance, I would've walked out.Total letdown.",The Dark Tower
95,Carycomic,"The only movie I've seen twice in a row, this summer. And it ain't bad!",9,20 August 2017,"There's been a lot of publicity stating how the Stephen King novel series was inspired partly by an old poem (called ""Childe Roland To The Dark Tower Came"") and partly by the spaghetti-Westerns of Sergio Leone back in the 1960's. Me? I would've called the resulting movie adaptation a cross between MAD MAX and the original STAR WARS (aka ""Episode 4: A New Hope""). But, no matter how you describe the inherent similarities, the fact remains that this is a great action-adventure flick with fantasy swashbuckler elements that just manage to rise above the stereotypical. For starters, there's the poignancy of Jake Chambers' dysfunctional home life (biological dad died a hero; mom remarried a self-centered jerk). Which, of course, is nicely balanced by the comedy relief of Roland's culture shock at the so-called ""civilization"" still extant on Keystone Earth. Case in point?Roland: ""Are bullets as rare on your world as they are here?""Jake: ""You're going to like Earth. A lot!""My one and only complaint with this film, however, is that its trailers use outtakes for previews (a practice aggravatingly all too common in Hollywood)! I refer specifically to the scene where Jake tries to gauge the depths of Walter the MIB's inherent evil through a comparison to Christianity's greatest enemy. And Roland replies ""He's worse.""Why was that bit of dialogue edited out? Time and money constraints? Or too much potential controversy from religious fundamentalist groups? Well, whatever the reason, it still should have been left in. So, I am leaving one point out of my final score.",The Dark Tower
96,jessegehrig,"No, of course not",2,27 December 2017,"The difference between this movie and the books is: This movie is like a drawing of a stick-horse, a very poor drawing of a stick-horse. The stick isn't drawn strait and the horse head at the top of the stick looks more like a mitten than a horse. The books on the other hand, in this analogy, are an actual horse, a living breathing horse. A beautiful large animal that is bigger than you, much bigger in fact than you the mere would-be rider of this hypothetical horse. Now consider again the movie is not a stick-horse, but a poorly rendered drawing of a stick-horse compared to the books which are again as just stated, and actual living horse.

The young hero (Jake) continuously dreams and sketches The Dark Tower and dark demons, his parents are convinced he's a crack-pot and needs help. Jake finds a portal and is transported into another world – he helps the gunslinger to protect The Dark Tower and ultimately save the Universe.The main characters are the 'Gunslinger' played by Idris Elba, the 'Man in Black' played by Matthew McConaughey, and the young hero played by Tom Taylor (the standout performance).The film reminded me of 'Harry Potter' and 'the first Matrix' Not a bad film but not great either, but will be another franchise.",The Dark Tower

99,msbreviews,Rating: C,5,2 September 2017,"I didn't read any of King's novels. Honestly, I'm not a reader at all, so this review is coming from someone that doesn't really know or care about what's on the books unless it's perfectly clear that the film is negatively affected by something related to its source material ... Unfortunately, this is the case.I can't be the guy that starts annoying people around saying, ""Oh, in the book it isn't like this ... oh, this scene/character/subplot isn't in the book ... book, book, book"". I really can't be that guy since I don't read them, but there's something that this movie clearly lacks and that's depth to its own world.Nevertheless, I'll start with my pros. My major praise goes to the chemistry between Idris Elba and Tom Taylor (Jake). Their characters cross paths at the end of the first act and from that moment on, every single scene with them has something to deliver to the audience. There are some very compelling and emotional scenes, as well as some surprisingly funny bits here and there. For me, this is what keeps the film going, without ever feeling monotonous or boring.Elba is a true badass as Roland and I think he's one of the best action/thriller's actors working today. This character has a deep and tragic backstory that makes us care for him, so when the action goes down the movie elevates itself due to its protagonist. Taylor is truly amazing as Jake, who also has a heartfelt and captivating story going on with his family and with himself since he's no ordinary boy. The young actor proves himself through an excellent job portraying a multiple-layered character with tons of emotions.The film's concept is pretty interesting and the universe where the screenplay takes place is very intriguing, which actually improved the first act's quality. The action sequences are well-filmed due to some cool scenes with slow-motion and good stunt work, but they're never something more than one would expect.Matthew McConaughey is great as the Man in Black and if it wasn't for him, I think that this villain could have been a huge problem. Walter is the cliché bad guy, who wants to rule the universe because he desires power and control. He has no unique motivations and I feel nothing towards him since I have no reason to love him or hate him.Going back to my first couple of paragraphs, I can't help but feel that something is missing. A lot of details from the overall story are omitted for sure because some parts of it just seem inexplicable or unexplored, which even makes some of the movie's logic fall apart. I know for a fact that this isn't an adaptation of just one book but from several instead, so I'm pretty sure that a lot of the missing information is lost somewhere in the books due to the director and writers' questionable choices.This leads to a lack of plot's depth since there's so much left to explore by the end of the film. Once again, the studios focused on instantly building a franchise without first working on making a good movie and only then start developing a saga. There's so much mystery surrounding this new world, but the only ""answers"" that I get come from expositional dialogue, something excessively present in this film.The plot is as conventional as it can be and that kind of ruins the whole movie. There's never an incredibly suspenseful moment since the screenplay follows every cliché that ever existed. The ending feels abrupt and the supposedly awesome, tension-full last battle between good and evil, falls flat.I think part of the script's problem is definitely the film's runtime. For an adaptation this big, 95min is so short that I find hard to believe that no one realized that this wasn't going to work. If you're a fan of King's novels, I'm pretty sure you're going to feel disappointed, at least. If not, then you'll just find this movie ""ok"". It's nothing that you haven't seen before, but it can just entertain for an hour and a half.All in all, The Dark Tower has an interesting concept and a mysterious universe open to exploring. The cast is great, especially Idris Elba and Tom Taylor, who have amazing chemistry. Their well-developed characters share most of the film's best scenes, from the action sequences to the funniest moments. However, the huge lack of depth to the story, an extremely conventional plot, a very cliché villain, a lot of expositional dialogue and a surprisingly short runtime bring the movie down to the floor, but they still leave it just breathing.Full Spoiler-Free Review on my blog :)",The Dark Tower

To be honest I can't judge by the books as I never read them and I can see that they are probably not justifying them with the film. The story was incredibly thin and I guess it was the most intention to just show constant action and special effects. 
Oh well I did enjoy the references to some other Stephen King novels/movies which was a plus. The film had some nice effects, okay action and I liked both Idris Elba and Matthew McConaughey in their roles. Sure both overacted a little but it somehow fitted the flow of the film and wasnt as bothering as something like that usually is. The score and look were fine. The biggest problem was both direction and writing as this really brought the film down from what it potentially could have been. Yeah, its not necessary to watch it, but if you do its not a complete waste of time, at least if you switch your brains off. Just too bad that the potential was not used.",The Dark Tower

105,Java_Joe,What was that?,3,13 November 2019,"This movie just goes to show that you can't condense 7 books into a two hour movie without losing a LOT in the process. I get it though, it's an adaptation and adaptations tend to use ideas from the source material but not necessarily follow the story itself. But what we got was NOT the Dark Tower in any way, shape or form. To put this into more recent terms, imagine something like the Harry Potter books but taking all that story and condensing it into a two hour movie. And instead of Harry Potter taking on Valdemort in a wizard's duel in the final chapter, instead Valdemort wants to steal Harry's power and some dude just shoots him in the end. That's what this movie is. It's the Dark Tower in name only.Now they got some parts right. Some. Not a lot. Some of the characters show up. Some of the plot points are covered. Some of the ideas from the series are brought up. And that's about it. What we're left with is the bare bones of the novels stitched together in an attempt to make a movie.What we're left with is some cluttered and, honestly, not very interesting story. I'm actually glad I waited and saw it on Netflix instead of paying to see it in the theater.If you want to know what happens, read the books. Stephen King might not be able to write a decent ending, but the main story more than makes up for it.",The Dark Tower
106,judywalker2,Mediocre,5,9 August 2017,"I was looking forward to this movie initially; but, after reading several reviews I went into the theater not expecting much. There wasn't much to this movie. The story was mildly interesting but I agree with the several other reviews saying the characters were not flushed out enough to garner a connection to the audience. When I think of an endeavor such as this, so much information,so many books, I think of LOTR. Peter Jackson was fully invested in the material and knew exactly what needed to be included in order to tell an entire story. Here there was little investment in the material and that's a shame. The actors did the best they could do with the materials and visually it was okay.I was interested enough to buy the book series and I know my own visuals will be better than this movie is.",The Dark Tower
107,PyroSikTh,The Dark Tower Movie is Finally Here!,7,22 August 2017,"It's my understanding that this movie is not an adaptation of the books, so lets get that out of the way first. A more accurate way to describe it would be inspired by the books, or if you're a stickler for continuity; a sequel to the books, as the story goes into the next cycle. The movie cherry picks a selection of key plot points, muddles them up, and moulds it into a whole new story.The movie's story revolves around a kid called Jake Chambers who suffers from regular nightmares about a village of kids whose minds are absorbed by a Man in Black and his troupe of skin-wearing creatures, and used to bring down the Tower. Being maybe a bit too vocal about these nightmares has resulted in Jake being put on a series of mental health programs until the latest just affirms his nightmares to be reality, and a clue from a new dream leads him to a portal to Mid-World, the home of Roland and Walter, the Gunslinger and Man in Black respectively, as one chases the other out of vengeance for the death of his father.One of the defining traits of the Dark Tower series is the way it connects multiple Stephen King stories together, making them all part of a shared multiverse. The movie was obviously a little restricted in both time and copyright laws, but it does a pretty good job of making this clear nonetheless. The most obvious are the links to The Shining. The Overlook Hotel can be seen in a framed picture, and Jake is often referred to as having the ""Shine""; the same brand of psychic ability as Danny Torrence (which I believe is also mentioned in The Stand). They also pass by a theme park in Mid-World called Pennywise, a nod to the infamous clown from the upcoming IT (and the one in the 90s, obviously). One of the portal addresses is 1408, there's a poster from The Shawshank Redemption, a toy car reminiscent of the one in Christine, and features the book that kicks off the events of Misery. Other than the Shine, nothing particularly big is made of any of these little hints and references, and they pose more as little easter eggs in the background for hardcore fans than anything else.One thing that really surprised me about this movie was it's pacing. Alarm bells rang when I heard it was only about an hour and a half long. It helps understanding that it makes no attempt to even adapt a single book from the series and instead forges its own narrative, which was probably a better idea than hoping for sequels or splitting the story up between movies and TV shows. While I'm sure a hell of a lot of depth is left out, the movie itself never really feels wanting. A lot is explained quite well, and there's a lot that's deliberately left a little more mysterious, but a lot happens in this movie, and none of it feels rushed. We get some faster-paced moments of action and some slower moments of character building and neither feels like it's giving way to the other. The movie feels natural and just the right length to tell the amalgamation story it wants to tell. Could it have done with more? Sure, but I like long movies with over-complicated plots and deep backstories into characters and worlds. I never felt like The Dark Tower needed it though.The action is thoroughly enjoyable though. It definitely prefers style over realism, but as the concept is so high-fantasy/sci-fi anyway it doesn't take much to suspend disbelief. Roland's skills as a Gunslinger are the main point of interest in these scenes; watching him land incredible trickshots and reloading his guns in ever fancier and more interesting ways was a delight to watch. Seeing him demolish an army of men with a series of quick, successive gun blasts was hugely entertaining.The Dark Tower is not a bad movie by any stretch of the imagination. I feel critics, and some audiences, have been just a little too harsh on it. It has some fantastic visuals, a serviceable score by Junkie XL, Idris Elba and Matthew McConaughey ripping up the scenery in the most high-fantasy ways, a number of connections and easter eggs to other King properties, and a story that is engaging, well-paced, and is deliberately more inspired by the books than attempts to adapt them. This is not the epic series put on to the big screen, it's something else entirely. Go in with that in mind and I guarantee you'll find enjoyment in it. At worst The Dark Tower is a safe, low-risk, passable movie made to appeal to mainstream audiences as best it can. At best it's a genre-bending fantasy/sci-fi with stylish action scenes and bizarre concepts. I give it a respectable 7/10.",The Dark Tower
108,Darth_Osmosis,If you can't do it right...,2,11 August 2017,"Ahh ""The Dark Tower"" - The story of one man's epic quest through time and space to find and save the elusive Dark Tower! A story of Gunslingers who dished out justice as honorable knights, wielding giant revolvers instead of swords to ward off mischievous warlocks and wizards. Memorable characters like Shardik the 40 feet tall cybernetic bear and a suicidal sentient train called Blaine... a source material deserving a ""Game of Thrones"" caliber TV-show... Made into a 90 minute movie that only resembles the source material if you really squint your eyes, use your imagination and pretend that it's all through a fun-house mirror..

It's a slap in the face to every fan who has ever read the Dark Tower books, who have loved them, followed the story of Roland and his Ka-Tet for years. All in the name of making some money.Some have said that this film is a ""continuation"" of the original story which, if you ask me, is a band-aid the studio put on it, realizing what a pile of garbage they had made and wanting to salvage as much of its reputation as they possibly could. And, of course, it's nothing short of disheartening to hear the creator of this universe, the King himself, praising this film (although, given his track record of bashing Stanley Kubrick's adaptation of The Shining, it wouldn't surprise me if the sharing of his honest opinion went against his contract).This film takes 8 books, dilutes the plot into a single movie and tries to pass it off to fans as a new telling of one of their favorite stories. Fans of other franchises easily dismiss the King fans and label them as ridiculous or overly dramatic, but anybody who read the books will feel insulted by this.It's one thing to do an adaptation that isn't good. It's bound to happen and, more often than not, it's the reality for a lot of these films. But not many adaptations squish a long series of books into a single film, because they realize what a bad idea that is.This was a failure from the very beginning and everyone involved in it should be ashamed of themselves.",The Dark Tower

113,coreyjdenford,Towering bland,4,18 August 2017,"This review of The Dark Tower is spoiler free** (2/5)ADAPTING STEPHEN KING isn't always an easy task it can go either way from the good - IMDb users are calling The Shawshank Redemption the best film ever made or it can go horribly wrong. However Hollywood have been wanting to adapt King's beloved eight novel series The Dark Tower for a little over a decade, there was an idea to make it a PG friendly TV series, a film came into play too but the budget was too high to make it that project was then binned. It only took until today to come into fruition. And it's definitely not as good as anticipated.The plot would be fine, as far as it goes; from the start what we know is that. ""There is a Dark Tower that stands at the centre of the universe, and it's said that only the mind of a child can bring it down."" There's the last Gunslinger Roland Deschain (Idris Elba) a guardian who protects the tower from collapsing and starting a war between the two worlds. He protects it from the eternal threat of Matthew McConaughey Walter O'Dim A.K.A The Man in Black, a super sorcerer or mind changer or a mixture of the two (emphasis is high on mind changer). Finally there's Jake (Tom Taylor) who imagines this world in his dreams drawing what he sees in these dreams. The plot only goes so far as much as it is visually stunning from a few vicious woodland creatures to the tower itself its mind blowing. But these visuals can't save the convoluted which is sadly squashed into a 95 minute runtime glossing over some the more important plot points from King's novels into an unsatisfying action bombast. Though it's not all bad as the performances are solid, Elba infuses Roland with in-depth levity adding humour to some of the later moments and he adds emotional impact especially with his stories about his late father. And he gets keen support from his young apprentice newcomer Taylor who gives emotion to his performance too particularly during their times of bonding.McConaughey is reduced to a pantomime parlour trick, of course he uses his powers to manipulate people's minds - there is some cruelty to him by using a simple ""stop breathing"" command but that's really about it. He's essentially the film's Lord Voldemort but the sad truth is that his novelty charm soon runs thin and becomes just an overused parlour trick which sadly over time gets boring. Plus the ability of him using a child's mind to destroy the tower is cut short and left rubbery as an added aesthetic to the story adding nothing to the convoluted plot.The action disappoints too, Roland shoots his way through misguided 2D enemies with excellent precision and aiming sure enough but Nikolaj Arcel's poor direction and misjudged handling leaves them feeling dry and tasteless. There are a few action scenes that generally feel rushed from a shootout in a carnival with Roland using his instincts to the last Roland vs. Man in Black battle scene are left unsatisfying and bland. They're dark too thanks to the grey on black colour palette which makes hard to see what is going on. It's almost as if they ran out on the budget for better lighting. Of course there is love for some of King's earlier work - ""His shine is pure"" or ""He will be our Armageddon"" as a reference to The Shining. Thankfully offering some light to the film. But this is an overly disappointing King adaptation that sadly ties crumbled plot points with rubbery action and poor direction. It may be better going to the Man in Black to erase your mind after the credits end. VERDICT The Dark Tower is a sadly disappointing King adaptation leading crumbles bits of story of convoluted plot points to a generally fantastic Elba who is left watered down and boring.",The Dark Tower

115,DeBBss,Expected more...,5,9 November 2017,"I have never read a Steven King novel, so that might effect my review. The Dark Tower right now is getting a lot of hate, yes I understand the issues, but still it doesn't deserve a 1 or 2 out of 10. I think the reason why it's getting a lot of hate is because of the novel fans, so I guess they pictured it to be exactly the same as the novel, or maybe i'm wrong or maybe people genuinely hate this movie.Story: 7/10As I have already mentioned, this is a Steven King novel, so it's going to have a unique story, and it does. The whole idea is to take kids that have shine and use their shine to destroy the dark tower, which keeps all the evil outside of the universe. The man in black (Walter) is the leader of this plan. Walter's plan is to destroy the tower so all the evil can enter the universe. The tower is basically a shield in the middle of the universe, and there's only one. I always questioned, why is there only one tower? A major issue I have about this movie is that it doesn't explain in enough in detail, why didn't people discover these portals?, what happens to the kids that failed to destroy the tower? I feel like the writers expected everyone to read the novel. Overall, creative story, but too much plot holes.Characters: 6/10 Walter: Walter is the evil guy you see in the trailer. They made Walter so powerful, but he didn't accomplish anything, Walter could end the whole world easily if he wanted to. They could have made Walter a tad more convincing and or play a bigger part in the movie.Roland: I like the character Roland, I think they did a good job on him. Roland is a cliché, but a good cliché, if that makes sense. I liked the character. I have one issue, I wanted to see more of Walter's origin, if the creators expanded on him, I think that would make the character more likable.Jake: If I had one word to describe Jake, I would say average. Jake is such an average character, I only got to see what he could do at the end of the movie. I would like to see more of his powers than his dead dad to be honest.Action: 5/10I expected more action, the movie could have been better if it was two hours long, I felt like it was rushed, if the movie took it's time, I would see more action and more story telling. When there is action, it gets very entertaining, we get to see how accurate and skilled Roland is. If the action was more bloody and violent like a rated R movie, it would be more fun. The movie has a realistic feel, but we don't get a more grim violent gunfights. Another part about the action is how much action we get, there is only two action scenes with Roland, so that bothered me.Overall I expected more, and I did get somethings that I was wishing for, but not enough. It felt rushed, I wanted to see more Roland, less about Jake's dad and a scarier Walter. If The Dark Tower had all of that, I think it would have been a 6 or 7 out of 10",The Dark Tower

117,kermitkid,Would have worked better as tv show,8,31 March 2020,"I don't know what movie the critics saw, but it obviously wasn't this one, because there's no way this deserves an 18% on Rotten Tomatoes. This was awesome! At times the plot could be a little confusing, but the parts I understood, I loved! I don't know what the critics' problem with Matthew McConaughey is in this movie. He was really good. He managed to ham it up without hamming it up too much. He was a fun villain without becoming a charicature. Idris Elba as always, is fantastic! He manages to be serious and brooding, but also adds a bit of comedy to the role when appropriate. (Psst, DC, cast him as Jon Stewart in the next Green Lantern movie. Hint hint) My one problem was that the editing was off continuity-wise sometimes. Specifically, for the actor Tom Taylor. I'm assuming he hit puberty part way through production, because for the first half of the film, his voice is high, and then all of a sudden out of nowehere his voice gets deep in the second half. They should have gone back and redubbed the first half. The action sequences are awesome! My jaw dropped! They're fast paced and don't have the ""slow mo shot"" cliche that so many films do nowadays. Without spoiling anything, I will say that if you read a lot of Stephen King's other books, you'll see some Easter Eggs. (Some are blink-and-you'll-miss-it). Ignore the critics and decide for yourself.

118,ginocox-206-336968,"Contrived, confusing, and ultimately disappointing",4,9 October 2017,"""The Dark Tower"" is contrived, confusing, and ultimately disappointing. What seems to be becoming old school is the axiom that movies should express a central theme – some sort of lesson in life that the protagonist must learn and embrace in order to escape stasis and overcome an otherwise insurmountable obstacle. Unfortunately, in today's politically reactionary society, many filmmakers neglect a theme for the protagonist's life, electing instead to make a political statement, which is invariably left of Lenin and considered incomprehensible and sophomoric by conservatives. TDT is loud and clear with a statement about gun control, which seems so incongruous in a film where a principal character fires off enough rounds to impact executive bonuses at Smith & Wesson, but the greater threat to human life is posed by another character who never uses firearms. (A second, less blatant, message concerns an ethnically diverse community living in peace and harmony.)The actual theme, which is repeated several times, is that anybody who betrays a sort of warrior code ""forgets the face of his father."" Several characters attempt to assume the role of surrogate father for high school student Luke, including his mother's doofus second husband, the villain and ultimately, the guardian character, whose father was also killed. This scene, which occurs during the denouement, involves the two characters eating hot dogs sold by a New York street vendor. The scene has garnered a lot of attention, with several YouTube videos, Internet articles and mention in both of the professional reviews I read. I avoid pork (which is nearly impossible in Thailand), avoid processed meats and especially avoid hot dogs for health and dietary reasons. I don't even like the odor when others eat them, so I am hardly an impartial observer. Perhaps I am overly homophobic, possibly due to living in Thailand, which has an unusually large population of ladyboys. But the Freudian implications of an adult male offering to mentor an adolescent male while both are eating hot dogs strikes me as creepy weird. But this may well be an outlying viewpoint. A superficial Internet search didn't uncover any similar reactions. Performances by McConaughey, Elba and Taylor are as good as the script allows, but the movie is a mess. The villain wants to destroy the tower that holds all the universes together, so monsters can take over. But why? He's not a monster, so why does he care? If he destroys all the universes, what's left to take over? How will he use his portals to teleport from one universe to another, without the tower to hold them together? The monsters seem stronger than mere mortals, so why do they need his help? We never visit the tower or understand what it really does. Nor do we visit any of the other universes, other than our own and Midworld. The gunslinger doesn't really need the kid to defeat the wizard. The way he does it makes no sense relative to the laws of physics. None of the characters seem to have arcs. The gunslinger gives Jake a pistol and they practice shooting targets together, but Jake never uses the weapon in actual combat. If legend maintains that a single child can bring down the tower, why is the wizard wasting his time trying to harness the combined energy of several children? The only part of the movie that seems clear is the message about gun control, but it doesn't make any sense.",The Dark Tower
119,kaptenvideo-89875,The ultimate King movie? More like the ultimate hype!,5,14 August 2017,"The last Gunslinger (Idris Elba) is locked in eternal battle with mysterious Man in Black (Matthew McConaughey), determined to prevent him from toppling the Dark Tower, which holds the universe together. Stephen King has released a lot of books already (most of them fiction), and there's also a big number of screen adaptations of his work. But this is the first fruitful attempt to bring his Dark Tower"" saga to the cinemas, which has already disappointed and/or made angry a lot of fans and critics. Controversy was to be expected. King himself and many of his admirers find Dark Tower"" series his crowning achievement and magnum opus, so there was probably never going to be a way to adapt even part of the eight novels into a movie. At least not in a way that would satisfy both constant readers and those who just came to see a sci-fi/action movie alike. The project was in pre-production hell for quite some time and the various parties had several different approaches to make it all happen. I am not sure what was the motivation behind using the script that they finally used, but to call this a Dark Tower"" adaptation, or even King adaptation, is kind of stretching it. What they did was to take some elements of the whole big DT mythos, including three of the major characters, and then change it whatever the hell way they wanted. I am not against remixing King per se, and some new things are pretty cool to see on the screen at last – concentration camp for shining"" children"" and the mentioning of Keystone Earth, for example. But the new story, which is replacing King's stories, is underwhelmingly shallow to say the least. In 94 minutes, there's no room on any world, story, character and relationships building that King has famous for. Most of the events happen and pass fast, just because it is supposed to happen, not that it develops organically from what has come before. It's not a satisfying solution, not for King lovers, not on its own. The only good thing I have to say about the screenplay is that you can follow it without having read any of the King's work. But then again, it also makes the ending too definite and clear-cut which was never the aim of the series. Matthew McConaughey is good too, ruthless and menacing, although they have changed his character in ways that I don't quite like, making him kind of boring. If the nemesis has lost much of the mystery surrounding him and has become almost unbeatable, it's quite hard to hold suspense when he's around. I also like that Idris Elba has gotten another starring part in major project, but it's far from his more memorable work such as in The Wire"". We don't get to know enough of gunslinger to care about him deeply – I would say it's actually part of the problem with the book series too. Elba gets to shoot a lot and growl some lines (on screen, he's actually chattier than in books) but I can't say he comes across as terribly charismatic or memorable. Still, some call him one of the best things in the movie. As a long-time King fan, I am still kind of glad to have seen a Dark Tower"" movie, and the visual side is enjoyable enough – mostly locations, some of the action scenes feel a bit generic. But this is not the movie we've been waiting for. At best, we can call it a piece of fan fiction, in the form of long-waited movie. Oh, almost forgot. As a long-time fan, I have read almost all of King's many novels and collections, and consider Dark Tower"" series not among his best work. Especially limp are the last two parts (6 and 7), and Keyhole"". The movie is not limp, at least, just not enough fleshed out to justify all the hype and waiting.",The Dark Tower
120,WalkdenEntertainment,It's A Quick Trip To The Dark Tower...,6,10 January 2019,"Based on the well written novels by Stephen King, The Dark Tower is a story of the last Gunslinger, Roland (Idris Elba). Roland is locked in an eternal battle with Walter, aka The Man in Black (played by Matthew McConaughey), who continues to try and take down ""The Dark Tower""; the key to holding the universe together. The eternal battle takes a new turn when a young boy named Jake begins to have dreams and consequently discovers Roland's universe, finding the gunslinger himself.I personally had no idea of the storyline of The Dark Tower when I entered my late cinema session. After watching the film, I found it interesting to learn that the whole Dark Tower book series has a total of 8 books (or 4,250 pages to be exact!).Our 3 lead characters did a fantastic job, but a worthy mention goes out young actor Tom Taylor who plays the role of Jake. I also enjoyed seeing Matthew McConaughey being 'a man of evil' as the film's lead villain. While the characters and visual effects earnt a thumbs up from me, and the sounds of the gunslinger's handgun blasting around the speakers was amazing, it is the film's pacing and overall runtime that held this film back from being a top film in 2017. Considering the Dark Tower is a massive book series, the film seems to pick and choose minor and basic details of the whole story rather than explaining anything in depth. This includes both the hearts of the characters and the universe we are introduced to. Even as the film started, I had questions from the get go and felt like I had missed something. Throughout the story I was curious about certain areas of the story but sadly some elements are never explained and simply skipped over. But, even due to these factors, I'm happy to say there is still fun to had if these factors can be ignored. Otherwise, The Dark Tower could not leave you feeling as invested as the Director was hoping to achieve.Overall, I found The Dark Tower a brainless, fantasy action film. It's loaded with a couple of great lead actors, but if you're keen to be invested in this massive world, you might be disappointed. In my option, there is a great story and universe here, but the film needed more time to explain and perhaps even be explained over multiple films, but instead everything is rushed and crushed into one film.5.6/10

123,Aly200,"Good for entertainment purposes, but not as exciting as the books",7,12 August 2017,"After more than a decade in production limbo, Stephen King's epic book series about a lone gunslinger finally came to the big screens. Was it really worth the wait? In some ways not so much, but there is some good entertainment to be had. The plot follows Jake Chambers, a gifted youth, and gunslinger Roland Deschain as they journey to do battle with the evil Walter O'Dim, otherwise known as the Man in Black who wishes to destroy the whole world. The film's performances are fairly engaging and well chosen, but without much backstory there is little motivation for why the characters act in certain ways: 1. British actor Idris Elba was a tough choice for the role of Roland for me at the time of casting, but Elba is extremely talented and does bring his usual gravitas to the role. However Roland's motivation is explored much further in the books as his journey is drawn out for eight books. Elba is charismatic in his usual way which is a perfect asset, adept at demonstrating Roland's firearm prowess and does home in on his basic motive to stop the villain. The actor recites the iconic Gunslinger's Creed with pure heart as Elba hones in on Roland's dedication to hunt down Walter/the Man in Black. 2. Newcomer Tom Taylor as young protagonist Jake Chambers is not a bad choice given Jake is thrown into a life-or-death situation and must adapt to the circumstances. Taylor's amateur skills show as he works on his chemistry with Idris Elba, his dialogue delivery is in need of work but is not awful. The changing of the boy's age from a pre-teen in the books to a young teen makes sense in order to draw in younger viewers and make Jake more relatable, but leaves little room for real growth as a character in a ninety minute film. However Taylor works with what he is given and is able to create a quasi-believable unlikely hero, but struggles to shake his constant wide-eyed look and stilted line delivery. 3. The best performance in ""The Dark Tower"" (aside from Idris Elba's Roland) is definitely the eerie and foreboding Man in Black as played by Oscar winner Matthew McConaughey in his first significant villain role (aside from a twist end in 2001's ""Frailty"" and anti-hero Killer Joe in William Freidkin's 2011 thriller ""Killer Joe"")). Smarmy, sleazy, chilling and delightful in his destruction McConaughey imbues Walter with a terrifying sinister factor much needed to play a destructive entity. Bringing his trademark Texan drawl laced with husky whispers of menacing threats a hypnotic gaze, a silent and swift presence amps up the creep factor as the actor weaves a sinister charming web. Perfectly capturing Walter's soft voice (as described in the first novel) and having killer blue eyes (also a psychical trait of Walter in the novel), McConaughey casts quite a spell that sends shivers down the spine. Even cracking devilish grins without ever hamming it up, McConaughey commands the attention that Walter requires when he appears and makes him so realistic. While Walter's motives are the typical bad guy cliché of wanting to conquer the world, McConaughey subtly revels in the evil acts the Man in Black wreaks on Midworld and Earth in pursuit of global conquest. Let's see some villainous roles from Matthew as he nailed the wicked bad guy with finesse. To quickly gloss over the visual effects, there are some unique moments such as the nightmares Jake has as well as having some terrifying creatures pop up. The final fight between Roland and Walter is probably one of the best use of fight choreography and slow-motion camera work to heighten the tension.The screenplay goes all over the map in terms of tying to tie the story elements together. Simply put is that the hero is out to stop the villain from ending our existence as we know it and then there's a plucky kid who ends up having a special purpose in the story. Having four screenwriters shows throughout as the story falls in and out of being cohesive and then falling flat before plateauing to mediocre. Rumors of a two plus hour original run with more background on characters and the fantasy world Stephen King created would have been much better in giving depth to the characters and narrative. With audiences not wanting such a hefty run-time, the quality has definitely suffered from its ninety minute run resulting in the loosely-strung-together story. However if you want a basic intro to the Gunslinger saga this movie will give you a start. The books are still better though and span a fantastical tale.",The Dark Tower

It was more like The Goonies in places than the Dark Tower and seemed aimed at a teen audience.This was a really good opportunity but frustratingly it seems those involved were heading in the right direction but just turned it into a mess. It should have been at least a trilogy of 3 hr movies or a TV series with minimum of 4 seasons, not a 2 hr movie. A real shame.",The Dark Tower

133,mgruebel,A brighter tower than the reviews,6,10 April 2019,"Don't look to ""Dark Tower"" as an accurate filming of the King novels, if you enjoyed the Gunslinger's hunt for the Dark Man, across universes. However, as a fairly short fantasy film, this is far more cohesive than the reviews led me to believe.In this rendition, the boy Jake, just one of many characters sacrificed in the books, is cast as the main character, whereas the Gunslinger shows up to destroy the Dark Man only with Jake's help. This actually works, a retelling of the gist of the story from the boy's point of view, so to speak. I could not say the same of Jackson's ""The Hobbit,"" which retold the story from the point of view of pretty much everyone except for the Hobbit.The special effects are OK. The plot moves along swiftly from New York to the Gunslinger's world, and back to New York at the end, drastically simplifying the characters and story from the 70s shorts or 80s book. I can understand why King thought this was a pretty good summary of his story.Still, it does not rise above a ""6"" or a one time mildly entertaining view: the characters are not given enough time to develop, hence the tragic elements (e.g. the Gunslinger comforting Jake over his mother's death at the hands of the Dark Man) do not bear full fruit. The movie becomes too sequential, with each episode part of a perfectly logical progression, but one is left wondering why each episode was there other than being an arbitrary set piece in a quest. There is just not enough motivation or back story for any of the characters.So if you like an unpretentious, professionally crafted fantasy-action movie with an interesting premise, and you can live with the fact that it glides along a little too glibly, you'll enjoy this coming-of-age fantasy.",The Dark Tower

i couldn''t get through the first book, though i tried twice and have read at LEAST 10 Stephen King books...
I've been disappointed by many movies that have tried to bring his books to life on the screen...even the different versions of ''the shining''. sure, the kubrick/nicholson version was a good movie...but not a good movie of the book... left out key elements and then they go and kill one of the main characters without him doing ANYthing but rushing in to die...???
so yes. i understand the frustration. but ''shining'' is still a good movie...
as is ''the dark tower''.

I understand a lot of negative reviews of this is because this isn't like in the book. However as a person who has never read the books, I can tell you I really enjoyed watching this! and here's why.cinematography:
camera shots and special effects are great, C.G.I is also good.acting:
the main characters are basically two protagonists and the antagonist, and doesn't really stretch upon any other character arcs. However the acting was good for all who played their parts.Plot:
The story was really interesting (not having read the books) and kept me glued the whole time watching. It's very supernatural like, however there was some very cheesy parts in here and what seemed to be a lot of things that you don't understand if you haven't read the books.Overall I would recommend this if you haven't read the books, otherwise you might be disappointed based on critics reviews. Worth a watch and definitely worth a 8/10 for me.",The Dark Tower
138,rutzelb,Great Sci-Fi Movie,10,8 November 2017,"Gunslinger Roland (Idris Elba) befriends young Jake (Tom Taylor) who has visions of The Dark Tower, The Gunslinger, and The Man in Black: Walter O'Dim (McConaughey). Jake enters a portal and meets Gunslinger Roland, who must defeat the Man in Black in order for the Dark Tower to stay complete so it will hold the universe together. The Man in Black knows only a child can bring the Dark Tower down and he constantly kidnaps children and sends them to the Dark Tower to topple it. We get to see 2-worlds: Keystone Earth where we are and Mid-World where a war has devastated the land and where the Man in Black has his headquarters. We also see that Mid-World has advanced technology that the Man in Black uses to send children to the Dark Tower. The winners in here are McConaughey and Elba and it was a joy to watch both as their characters confront each other in Good vs Evil battles. I believe this is some of the best work from both of them. Oscars? Hmmm.maybe.But let's not forget young Jake played by Tom Taylor as he did a more than credible job as the youngster no one believed when he told his parents and even showed them drawings of Gunslinger Roland, The Man in Black and the Dark Tower. He carried his role convincingly for one so young in this type of Sci-Fi movie. Kudos. Keep in mind that this is only as good as it is because CGI makes everything we can imagine quite real. The cinematography was hauntingly good at times. And the pacing was perfect. Kudos. Well, of course, the terrific acting performances of Idris and McConaughey also helped. Oscars? Asking again? Hmmm..maybe.Notables: Dennis Haysbert as Steven, the father of Roland (I still miss him in The Unit TV show); and a very pretty Katheryn Winnick, Jake's mother and who is fantastic in the TV show Vikings, which should be coming up soon. (Can't wait)This is a very enjoyable Sci-Fi movie and if it had lasted longer, we would have enjoyed it even more. Hope there is a sequel in the works. (10/10)Violanece: Yes.

If you changed the names of the characters and the title of the movie there would be nothing to associate with the Dark Tower series. So the real question to ask is why make a movie from a book if you're going to change everything except the names of the characters and the title?If you want to make up a new story then don't ruin a great story.

They obviously loved it, probably because they're SK fans or possibly they just like anything sci-fi=ish/fantasy-ish. I'm more the latter although I have enjoyed a few movies based on SK stories such as Needful Things, Hearts In Atlantis and, well, ok, that's a couple.On paper this has everything going for it - the very universe itself is at stake - but the character empathy is cliched and superficial so audience involvement is superficial or by-the-numbers at best, and so much about the sci bit is unexplained (why are far-off, technically advanced civilisations always human and live in a weird medieval world? for one).Watch it with no expectations and you might enjoy it but it really could and should have been so much better.",The Dark Tower

It stinks. Its just another action flick with little to no character development and given it took itself seriously, the premise was beyond absurd. Some magic tower is keeping several worlds protected. The bad guy wants to take it down. He has already nearly destroyed one world and wants to get to our Earth to rule that too. Problem is, he has no motive. He could already reach our Earth and was already insanely powerful and could have taken over our Earth easily in many ways from espionage to economics. He didn't need to take down the tower. Then we have this magic gun toting hero with a deep brooding voice who is out to avenge his parents. He does not believe in the gunslinger cause because his world was already largely defeated. But he get his drive back after he meets the kid in the show who was being hunted by the bad guy. He drops his revenge and decides to pick up the mantle of gunslinger. From then on he was basically a super human who can dodge hundreds of bullets and hit anything at will including his own bullets. The movie simply didn't have enough character development. I didn't care about any of the characters nor their drive. The plot also needed to be better grounded. It tries to tie the modern world to a fantasy world and I don't think it worked.",The Dark Tower

Idris Elba and Tom Taylor were awesome together and played well together. I liked the way they went from New York to Africa and back and forth. The look of the film, the cinematography was amazing. I do not see why people would not like this movie. People are always going to have a problem with book series and remakes because it seems like nobody can ever get it perfect. I did not read the books and did not know what this movie was about and I loved it. Matthew was great as the villain and I think Claudia Kim is beautiful.

146,tinovalkki,"Go see it, give it a change. We are urge to see this story properly",7,4 August 2017,"First of all I have to say few words to defend The Dark Tower movie. Movie based on very faintly to the book series and Stephen Kings created universe and it be only a scratch to achieve a grater story. In a way this movie is thought to be a kind of prequel of the series, I think. As a independent movie it works quite mediocre, not to tell too much what might to happen. So if you want to see more and dive deeper to this universe, I suggested you to invest some effort to this movie, at least to buy a movie ticket. Perhaps studio has been too modest and didn't have guts to invest enough to start this movie series well enough.Because movie company (Sony) has left to go on a fishing expedition, the only thing to blame (or thank) is company itself. Not the fans nor other audience. Me, myself went to see this movie with very mixed feelings. Especially, when I noted this movie is only 95 minutes long, I was wondering how on earth they can even scratch this universe. And they haven't. The movie introduces us to three main characters of book series and gives us only a glimpses of hint what the whole story has to offer. With this on plate they try to wake audiences interest to see more. In a way it works, but the other way it doesn't. Fans must be furious after years of waiting, when result is only bits of pieces of The Dark Tower universe. The other way movie might (just might) be a stimulant to audience who does not be familiar with Stephen Kings series of TDT books. Everything has left to the box office to tell of it's success. Movie audience is tried to address with low age certification (PG-13). Every one who are familiar with Stephen Kings books knows, that they are not any children stories.As a movie itself is very mediocre sci-fi and fantasy movie. To Stephen Kings fans has a little more to offer. It has some nice and thrilling glimpses and hints to other Kings masterpieces like Cujo, The Shining, Christine, movie 14 08 and ti It's Pennywise-clown. These small hints raised a little of my interest about this movie.As a one movie The Dark Tower is oddly confused and thin story. Many things are left to hang in the air and many occurrence are not explained enough. This may revenge itself at the box office simply because big audience is not familiar enough of this peculiar universe. If it wont get enough of audience, it will be pity that they didn't gave enough to earn audiences interest. This universe is so big and bizzar that it earns to told properly. Me, myself I am a little worried, that it won't get enough of audience. Because of that, I encourage you to spend a price of a movie ticket if you even hesitate a little about seeing this movie. Even if it is a mediocre film, it really isn't one of the worst Stephen Kings stories what has converted to a movie. Of course the are many way too better films about SK's books like Stanley Kubrick's The Shining, Kathy Bates starred (Oscar winning) role in The Misery or delightful TV series The Stand.If movie don't make enough money at the box office, only thin to blame is movie studio, who didn't got enough guts to invest this movie to tell us a great story, earned enough to tell properly. If movie sunk's at the box office the only thing that may save this story is relying on those big streaming companies like HBO or Netflix who may have guts and money enough to tell us this great story properly. Many favorite characters, like Odetta, Susannah, Oy, Eddie Dean and Blaine waits to be introduce them self.The Dark Tower introduces to us only few characters of series. Idris Elba is superb as a Gunslinger, Matthew Mc Conaughey serves well as a The Man In Black and Tom Taylor is decent as a role of Jake.As a movie The Dark Tower is mediocre, I would say like two and a half of a star movie, but with great actors and with some hints to Stephen King, I have to give this movie one more star. Let just hope, that in the future we will get a change to dive properly to this Stephen Kings bizzar and great universe. That is what all the fans wait to lick your chops.",The Dark Tower
147,mbs,"Very average/generic on the whole, but not the train-wreck people are making it out to be",4,3 August 2017,"Caught an advanced screening of this earlier tonight (it opens tomorrow night officially) and while it wasn't particularly good, i thought it was OK enough in that it was watchable (the pacing of the film is all right enough) and that Idris Elba was good as The Gunslinger and while he's very, very dry and laconic which he's of course supposed to be, he give what I thought was an effective performance on the whole. (and honestly even the actor who played the kid who is in fact the narrative focal point of the movie is fine enough, he's not terrible) (McCounaghey is effectively evil with his constant deadpan, but its not really much of a role for him, he's kind of just there but he's OK in the part.) There are to be sure a lot of flaws in the film. Just a lot of things in the film could have been better on the whole...BUT it should be said that while a lot of people will probably hate this film or try and make it out to be one of the worst of the year, it was not nearly that bad, its not Battlefield Earth level quality here. It just wasn't all that good either. Quality wise on the whole i would say the film is like right in that middle ground area there where you can shrug your shoulders and say it was all right i guess and then you go right ahead and pick it apart with your friend afterwards (which is more or less what I did) But again I thought it was watchable enough despite its drawbacks as a whole but if you really need to know, the effects fall more than a little on the chintzy side (my friend said the effects budget seemed like it was rather limited) and that the grand epic fight scene that the film should have been building up to falls a good ways short of being epic. (same friend said that this actually falls in line with the ending of the first novel saying as how that first novel's ending was also pretty anti climactic) But end fight scene aside, i can imagine this film airing on a regular basis on basic cable either on Syfy or TNT and people watching it again and again in that way will probably be right in line with the quality level of the film. Bottom line--its all right enough for a night out with friends, but its also really not worth the effort of going out too as well if going out requires much of an effort. Its not all that great, but it wasn't terrible either...it was average...quite average.I say this as someone who never read the books, however if you have read the books, I really, really hope you don't go in with sky high expectations. Since I haven't read the books can i state here that i thought the film played like a greatest hits collection of Stephen King's past works? You got a little bit of The Shining here, you got a little bit of The Stand there, mix and stir and serve! again i'm not saying it was bad, but the books had to be better than that right? I got a friend who is obsessed with the books and is dreading seeing this, so I'm kind of nervous what his reaction will end up being although I think I can predict it'll be on the negative side. But even with that i hope he'll at least think that Idris Elba was decent enough...at least i'll try and argue that.",The Dark Tower

150,rmarkd,"Not like the novels, but I liked it",7,14 May 2020,"Let's get this out first: this movie is not like the books. Anyone looking for an adaptation of the 7 books into a 90 minute movie will unsurprisingly be disappointed. I'm not even sure the books can be made into movies. I just don't see how lobstrosities, talking monorails and the like would translate, let alone scenes like Detta and the demon. I'd call this more of a movie inspired by the books, but even that's a stretch. It's not like World War Z book vs movie, but it's pretty close.If you take the movie in and of itself, I think it's pretty enjoyable. It tells the story of Jake Chambers, a kid in NY with visions of another world with gunslingers, a Dark Tower, and a man in black. Of course, no one believes that these are anything but dreams and, of course, they are anything, but dreams.Jake finds his way into the world of his visions and meets Roland, the gunslinger, who is trying to kill Walter, the man in black. Walter wants to destroy the dark tower, a tower that somehow holds off the monsters and evil found outside of the universe containing Keystone Earth, Midworld, and all the other worlds. To do this, Walter needs a special kid, a kid with the powers of the shine.As Jake and Roland try to find Walter, Walter ends up realizing that perhaps Jake is the kid that can finally destroy the dark tower. Toss in a few plot advance points and a few action scenes, and there you go.Idris Elba as Roland was great. I was initially disappointed when I heard he was going to be Roland. I figured Matthew McConaughey, who ended up playing the villian, would actually have made a good Roland. Doesn't matter though as I though Elba did a great job. Likewise I though McConaughey was great as Walter. The story doesn't have as epic a feeling as the book series, and, I admit it is hard to decouple the two. Having read the books, you just feel like there should be ""more"" to it. So while I liked it, I also felt it lacking.I struggled between a 6 and a 7 for this movie because of that fact. Even without the knowledge of the books, the movie feels like it should have been a trilogy, going into more detail of the other worlds, the history of Roland and Walter and the Dark Tower. I ultimately ended up giving it a 7 because I did enjoy the movie up until the end where I just felt like I wanted a bit more depth.",The Dark Tower
151,boris_unanimate,The Not So Dark Tower,6,20 August 2017,"First things first - like probably most people reviewing this movie, I'm somewhat of a big Stephen King and Dark Tower fan in particular. That means that I am reviewing this movie with the books and whole King multiverse in the back of my mind, but also as a movie that is supposed to be mostly just inspired by the books. With that out of the way, let's state the most obvious fact - Roland is black in this movie, and he is played by none other than Idris Elba. And while almost everybody will say that he did a good job, well he did, by unfortunately, he is not *my* Roland. On the other hand, he did a good overall performance for someone who probably didn't read all the books and didn't get really into the character of Roland. I might be wrong, but I guess everyone who read the books and got into the world of King has their own notion of what Roland should be like, except for his skin and eye colour, but that is now really not that important. Matthew McConaughey did a great job, despite me not feeling that threatened and scared by his performance though I would have wanted him to be more evil and menacing, but it's a PG-13 rated movie, so that's what we got.The rest of the cast is actually amazing; Jake Chambers is almost a home run, Tom Taylor was really believable as Jake, while the others were doing a decent job portraying a lot of characters that were made up just for the movie. The acting is done really well. Then there are the VFX and other SFX - they made the movie really come to life and gave it a somewhat authentic feeling, despite sometimes overdoing it, but I didn't mind too much. I was mostly glad to see TDT come to life and feel goosebumps every time someone recited a line from the book. And I've had a lot of goosebumps throughout the movie.The end note here is that this is a decent adaptation of King's The Dark Tower. Most of us expected it to be horrible and garbage, but I am positively surprised and amazed how much I really enjoy it. It is a good movie that has a somewhat rushed ending, but other than that I had a great time. If you think it is a bad adaptation, at least give it a watch and judge it as a movie that tries hard to please everyone under a PG-13 rating, and we all know Stephen King never intended this to be anything less than R rated and full of blood and viscera. But it's good. Not great, not perfect, it's a good movie and worth a watch. Even true fans can and should appreciate most parts of the movie.",The Dark Tower
152,annuskavdpol,Stephen King was something special,6,8 August 2017,"Stephen King's books which the movie ""Dark Tower"" is based often combines spooky with elements of both good and evil.""Dark Tower"" is a movie that I feel represents our 2017 age very well. Jake Chambers is a small boy that has a shining which can mean his ability to see into other worlds as well as to draw those other worlds; much like in the movie ""Close encounters of the Third Kind"" 1977 - where the lead actor continue to draw a site that represents a meeting point with aliens. In this movie, young Jake Chambers, a child who lost his father and who has a kind of step-father in his life, that does not actually like the poor boy.Jake Chamber is a kind of superhero. He is a kind and good boy who does end up saving the world from evil and darkness.This movie was very fun to watch because Stephen King's movies are always pretty predictable; with good versus evil, like in The Lord of the Rings Trilogy combined with Stephen King's own motives of what he perceives as good and evil.",The Dark Tower
153,tmpsvita,A project dead at its birth,4,20 January 2018,"I have never read any book belonging to this saga, in general I have never even approached a book by Stephen King, but I would really like to fix, maybe in the future I'll try, simply because from what I read on the Internet I was seemed to understand that this is an extraordinary saga.
But what I am 100% sure about is that this is not an extraordinary film, rather it is something far from extraordinary, the attribute that suits him most is ""disaster"".
But I think it is an inevitable result since we are talking about eight books, more or less enclosed in a single film, very short (only 1 and a half hours), especially for films of this type.
This led to a dead product at the start and practically nothing could prevent it.
The problems are really a lot, even the simplest and most obvious things for a blockbuster of this magnitude in this film do not work.
Even the special effects, despite the budget of 60 million dollars, are really mediocre and visually fake.
Even the action component does not perform the work it should: the most animated scenes that should amuse and entertain, are directed in a confused and amateur manner and produce the opposite result, confusing and annoying the viewer.
Really confused is also the script that, in an attempt to summarize the various books, can never develop the various contents, resulting extremely superficial, banal and unsatisfactory, this is also heavily penalized by the paltry duration.
The only one who tries to raise the qualitative bar of the film is Idris Elba who, not only offers an excellent interpretation, is also perfectly in tune with the character he plays, especially aesthetically.
Not the same for Matthew McConaughey who with his role as a villan gives us one of the ugliest interpretations of his enviable career; McConaughey in this film, in fact, is almost unbearable and his performance is as ridiculous as it is forgettable.
What is not forgettable, however, is the sad but well deserved result at the box office with only $111 million grossed worldwide.
Now I can only hope in the TV series that seems to be out soon, at least will return Idris Elba in the role of Gunslinger but with him unfortunately the director also returns.",The Dark Tower
154,garethvk,"Not As Bad As You Hear But More ""Inpired By"" VS ""Based On""",6,3 August 2017,"Adapting Stephen King stories for the screen has long been a difficult problem for Hollywood. For every ""Misery"" and ""The Shawshank Redemption"", there are many others such as ""The Mangler"", ""Cell"", ""and Graveyard Shift"" and many more where things did not go as planned. The big issue is that King often creates detailed characters with complex backstories and puts then in fully developed worlds that despite their supernatural nature, often are easy for readers to relate to.Also as any reader of his books knows, King is not one to spare the paper and his books can be very lengthy offerings. This is an issue for Hollywood as they are forced to condense a 400-800 page plus story in many cases to fewer than two hours of screen time. The solution has been to try television movies such as ""The Langoliers"", ""The Tommyknockers"", ""The Stand"", and ""It"". The problem with this format is that while spreading the story over multiple nights allows more time for the story, they gore and adult content which is often the core of the story has to be greatly watered down.Which brings us to ""The Dark Tower"", an adaptation of King's largest offering as the series covers seven books and a novella, not to mention a Prequel comic and more. The series rolled out from 1982-2004 with King often saying that he might never finish the series. Fortunately for fans he released three books from 2003-2004 and was able to declare the story told.The story tells of a world like ours, but different that has ""moved on"". It is a dying world where Roland (Idris Elba), is pursuing a wizard named Walter (Matthew McConaughey), who is responsible for laying waste the world and killing all that come into Roland's life. The books follow his unrelenting chase of The Man in Black over countless years and how he has become a cold and driven individual who thinks nothing of using people to get his revenge.Roland is the last of the ""Gunslingers"", a Knight like group who protected the world and who used guns that were rare in their world to keep the peace. Roland is highly skilled and unlike his now dead companions, is impervious to the magic of Walter which has allowed him to remain alive and continue his quest.The Man in Black is fixated on destroying the Dark Tower, which protects the many worlds in the universe from the outside evils that look to destroy it. Along with a young boy from Earth named Jake (Tom Taylor), Roland must find a way to save the universe and exact his revenge.The film keeps the conflict between Roland and The Man in Black but greatly condenses the story as it includes references to things in the first two books but omits much of the backstory and plot of the novels to tell what I would call a story that was inspired by, but not based on the books.This is at the core the biggest issue with the film. I have read the books and while I wanted an adaptation that was closer to them, I did find myself enjoying the film more than I expected to. The leads were very good and even though they had a very watered down script to work with, they did a good job and the finale does have some nice visuals and action to it.People I know who have read the books have naturally been very disappointed with the film but those who have not read the books have mentioned that they enjoyed the film and accepted it as a fun bit of escapist adventure.There has been talk of a television series that would focus more on the third book onward which hopefully would include how Roland gained new followers from our world who were trained to be future Gunslingers. That remains to be seen as the success of the film will likely hold the key. I hope we do get to see it as there are countless stories and characters yet to tell in this universe and I think fans deserve to see them as King wrote them.3 stars out of 5",The Dark Tower

With an admirable cast this one really fell flat in almost every way imaginable. With a short run time this one never had enough time to build up steam character developmentally leaving entirely too many questions unanswered. For those who read the books the only real things the movie actually adapted from was the Stephen King names and character names, otherwise the two were nearly completely the opposite. For those who had no prior knowledge of the intricate story this is hard to keep up with as the lack of needed character development is completely left out and leaves most viewers lost and left to just assume things in supposed key moments. It almost seems this needed several films just to really relay the book to movie better. All

The story is practically non-existent. Character development is superficial at most. The effects were somewhat okay. I just read that there are 8 different books in the series. I haven't read any of them, but I'm pretty sure that there's enough material to make ONE good movie (probably even more). Somehow the producers, director and writers of this so-called blockbuster managed to completely miss out on the opportunity. Great actors, enough money to make not just one, but two decent scifi flicks. How come this is so boring? Can anyone explain that to me? .. There are two good scenes in the whole movie: 1. the one where the gunslinger shoots the monster trying to take away Jake, 2. the one where the gunslinger shoots almost 100 bad guys at the end. That's about it. There's should've been many more humorous scenes. More action. Better story development. Instead, nothing really. Predictability and dullness. 3.5/10 for the effects and the two scenes. A wasted opportunity.",The Dark Tower
160,urthpainter,disgrace with redeeming elements,5,22 December 2017,"The good: Casting! This movie could have been great with this cast! Without question the best part of this movie. As a result, the performances are good, and this is across the board, so can't really crush the director for this broken interpretation of a Stephen King classic. This movie also had a huge budget... so many pieces in place to succeed. But that is not what happened.The beauty of King's work is how easy his stories are to translate to film. He writes in a visual style. His characters are generally not too complicated - very nuanced, yes - but in a King book the depth comes from his incredible story telling. His books are also often incredibly long, which (when he stays on track) give his characters depth through experience. The reader learns about the characters by what they do.The first book of The Dark Tower series is one of King's most interesting books, and to turn it to film is eminently achievable, especially with this budget. These are the names of the screenwriters, i.e., who to blame: Akiva Goldsman, Jeff Pinkne, Anders Thomas Jensen and Nikolaj Arcel. This movie needed four people to mangle what was already good? The writers stole the characters and a few ideas from King's book, then fabricated about 80% of the rest with their own insipid ideas. What were they thinking? Who is this movie for? Fans of the books and King are immediately insulted. People who know nothing of the Gunslinger books may be mildly entertained. At best, this is a slightly entertaining action movie with a smattering of science fiction and horror elements.If a screen writers job (adapted screenplay) is to capture the essence of the original material, this project is an absolute failure. But even in terms of character building, Roland begins this movie as a man, but by the end is some sort of agent from a Matrix movie, complete with superhuman abilities. The beauty of Roland from the books is his flawed humanity. True he's a bad ass gunslinger with a lifetime of killing experience and training, but he is just a man. He's also the main character, not the boy.I could continue on this very obvious path, but I believe my point has been made. Its an ok movie in terms of production, with an great cast. The script has very little relation to the original material, and though the dialog is competent (no small thing) - the story told is what it is: a jumble of ideas with very little meaning or cohesion.As a fan of the books I should score this a 1, but I've rounded way up for certain film making elements to an average 5/10",The Dark Tower

Mainly cause Idris Elba is a cool brotha to watch. He's intense, brooding and cool with firearms. I like that he did not joke and played serious the whole time. The kid provided the jokes. Nothing great but fun to watch him use guns and the action stuff. The spoiler is from fault in writing. Kid, if Gunslinger save your life two times you do not go against him. He is whatever he says he is and he is pretty much your god, cause you are alive. That's a fault in the script. Don't see your standard kid questioning a guy who just saved your life twice within a matter of days.",The Dark Tower
162,WooderIce64,"OK standalone, bad for a series",5,20 July 2018,"While Stephen King is undoubtedly known for his horror stories - Carrie, the Shining, and IT, among others - the Dark Tower is a fantasy series, telling the story of Roland Deschain, the last of the Gunslingers, and his attempt to defend the Dark Tower from the evil Man in Black. For someone like me who's never read the books, it was mostly harmless. Even without knowing the books, it's easy to understand. It's not like you need to read the books to watch this. There are still some things that don't make sense. For instance, why does the Man in Black want to destroy the Dark Tower? The movie never explains it. Idris Elba and Matthew McCoughnehey are definitely good actors, and it shows here. Those performances are the best part of the movie. Jake, the psychic protagonist, is not the same way, but you can't be picky with child actors. He's like a lot of other kids in Stephen King stories, but not as interesting. Roland, played by Idris Elba, is awesome because he's Idris Elba, but there's not much beside that. McCoughnehey is great as the Man in Black, and his distinct Southern accent fits the role well. The problems with this movie are that it's too short, it doesn't explain enough, and the ending is too conclusive, especially since the ending alludes to the prospect of sequels. Therein lies the problem. As a standalone film, it's OK. It's not a great film, even for a non-fan, but as an adaptation of a six-book series that clearly sets up a sequel, it fails miserably, because it combines elements of multiple books. What they should have done was what they did with the Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings series, where one book is one movie. As it stands, there's no denying it - they have all forgotten the faces of their fathers.",The Dark Tower

But simple is not a good word sometimes, it means lack of depth. In this movie, good acts good, evil plays evil, it's predictable and uninteresting . The costume and setting are very poorly made, that high-tech time travel equipment looks like a terrible production from last century that I never saw.Lastly, this movie was edited based on the novel by Stephen King! Although I never read the novel, yet I knew the who is Stephen King, and his influence. Only watching the movie, I couldn't imagine this is a story wrote by him. Especially I loved The Lord of the Ring, I am very disappointed that I lost a chance to watch the next 'The Lord of the Ring'. According to Wikipedia, Dark Tower is an epic high fantasy novel, it is a series of eight books that incorporates themes from multiple genres, including dark fantasy, science fantasy, horror, and Western; Such a shame, it has such potential.6/10 to its complete storyline but poor made costume.

164,pazu7,I think I know what went wrong here: (no spoilers),5,3 November 2017,"Excuse my hubris for asserting that I know exactly what was wrong with this film, but I do: it was actually three films crammed into the space of one. Admission: I was not a fan of the Dark Tower series. I love Stephen King but felt the Gunslinger, which I did read, was characteristic of his most annoying proclivity for compulsive writing. I know a lot of King fans love his ability to just wing-it until something interesting happens. But to me it is like someone telling a joke that never reaches the punchline. King has written some of my favorite books, The Shining, The Stand, IT, Green Mile and so many classic short stories. But although I made it through Gunslinger I was not inspired to go any further in that series. Too much meandering... sort of like this review. That said, I was looking forward to the film. The trailers looked good. Great cast. But the end result was rushed and unfocused. A relevant digression: I have two versions of a film called ""Warriors Of The Rainbow: Seediq Bale"". It's a dramatization of a true story about a handful of Pacific islanders who took on the Japanese army in WW2, The original is great. A 2 DVD set and lasts over 4 hours. But the USA release is a 1 disc re-edit that's about 2.5 hours. And it's just awful. I saw the short version first and could tell there is a great film hiding in there somewhere. And that's the same way I felt watching Dark Tower. There were great moments and scenes, but no crescendos, nothing was built up enough to have any real impact. Problem is there's no 2 disc version to save it. The studio should have committed to this work; invested the money and time to make a good series. But they took the short cut and wound up loosing money. Stupid. (btw: if you check out Warriors Of The Rainbow, do NOT get the short version. It's as bad as watching Dark Tower.)",The Dark Tower
165,sujanfaster,Not quite the dark fantasy,7,2 September 2017,"The primary reason I watched The Dark Tower is that it had two of my favorite actors in it. I have no idea about the Stephen King novel series about this movie. The Dark Tower falls somewhere in between a thriller, fantasy and an out and out action movie. As per the name, the movie indeed is dark and I am glad that it wasn't released in 3D.It would be stupid of someone to expect any logic in a movie with a storyline as such as this. To put it simply, the movie is about the fight between good and evil. Good here being 'The Gunslinger' Idris Elba trying to protect the world (oh wait, in fact the universe) from 'The Man in Black' Matthew McConaughey who is trying his evil best to bring a tower down and push the world into the darkness. The making of this movie is similar in the lines of movies like Ghost Rider. The dark tone, chase sequences and action is very relatable. However the lack of content makes this movie fall short from being a good action movie. Having said that there are some incredible gunfights and goosebump moments.Idris Elba with very few words and more action makes this movie watchable. Matthew's character starts off quite well but as the movie progresses it becomes stagnant. Another of the main character Jake, played by Tom Taylor is alright. He doesn't have much to do apart from being shocked and frightened. There isn't much to say about the rest of the supporting characters. The Dark Tower is enjoyable only if you are an action movie fan and a sucker for Goosebumps.",The Dark Tower

The Dark Tower is just another in the series of generic films with predictable plot, no real twists, hollow characters and lots of meaningless action sequences. I do not understand how they could cram such an extensive material from the books into 1h35min of film. The fact that it is so short might even be a highlight since the viewers are spared from falling asleep. The story is not gripping at all, the acting is average and the climax of the film is plain dull. I don't think much more needs to be said.

169,pintaxandre,Review without having read any book,6,1 December 2019,"First of all, I would like to point out what was good about this movie: the cast. Matthew McConaughey and Idris Elba had very good performances despite having to portray very poorly characters.
The film was also visually striking with a lot of mesmerizing landcapes. The CGI was good and I personnally found the directing ok, although not memorable.
The story, the script and the action scenes are however not well handled at all.
Every fight with Idris Elba is dumb because you never get to know what his abilities are and how he can sometimes take a lot of damage and other times not.
There are a few plot holes that felt necessary for a film that short. And that's a major problem: the film is way too short to develop consistantly any of its arcs and storylines. The characters are not developed and you don't understand their motivations on a deeper level. The main character is the most uninteresting, which should not be the case since we follow his journey all along.
Elements of the univers and its story are briefly explained, but since most of it isn't shown on screenm it is difficult to be really involved.
I would recommend to the writers to take lessons on how to tell a story and not hold back the universe and ideas you have at your disposal. I would also advise to explore the characters of a story and show exactly what drives them and what they can do. I hope you get it the next time, pals.",The Dark Tower

I mean, this is maybe not a plot problem per say, but it sure does demonstrate a lack of understanding of the ""heart"" of the whole saga...Example 2: The movie is some kind of coming of age story of a super psychic boy who also comes from New York, has roughly the same age, and has the same name as a character in the novels, but is in every other regards different. In the books, he's a secondary character. Here, he is the strongest breaker ever... He can take out the whole universe by himself!! This is important, and not to be dismissed. The story in this movie is a different one that in the Novels. The plot. The characters. Everything.Example 3: Roland as portrayed by Idris is NOT the gunslinger from the novels. Sure he's black, and that's obviously not the case in the books, but ok... The real problem is that when we meet this Roland, and throughout, the dude is only out for revenge and lacks the whole depth of the real Roland... This is like point 1 above, the ""heart"" of the story, but unlike that one, this one IS central to the plot and the whole movie. You see, Roland is the incarnation of stubborn resolve, of the perfect knight of life, the dumb/dull/determined bull, boring to a fault but totally and completely consumed by his quest to reach the tower. There's only one thing about the Dark Towers Series that is a constant, and that is Roland and his resolve to reach the Tower! That those in charge of this movie do not know this, that they did not respect this, is the sign of truly uninspired and dim-witted people trying to cash out on a story they understand nothing about. I wanted to like Idris as Roland, I did... but he was nothing like the mythical hero we all know and love.As for why SK let this happen? well, I mean, not like it's the first time!! lol I don't know how someone can have such a great talent for writing and yet no regards for how others warp and portray it on screen!! If I was him, and I had read this screenplay, you can bet I would have said no. Not happening... At least try and remain on point...

175,mshavzin,"The problem is casting Idris Elbow, not Stephen King",1,9 September 2017,"Lots of S King works are wonderful movies, and none of them are even remotely close to the books. Misery, Green Mile, The Shining, The Stand, Carrie....I could keep going. This would have been fine if Idris Elbow was not the person cast as Roland. First there is the issue of, to use a made up word, ""blackwashing"". Whether it was done with Stephen Kings blessing or not makes little difference. The character was written as looking like Clint Eastwood, with pale skin, brown hair and blue eyes. Whether it mattered or not depends on who you ask. But the movie pits two men against each other. One heroic, one completely evil. And making them two different races gives the movie an ugly spin. Thyen there is Idris Elbow's acting, or lack of it. Yes he can glower, although I think if I saw it in real life I would laugh. But he just is not interesting to watch. Spome people find him attractive, But I never did get it. He looks exactly like what he is. A spoiled actor with an over inflated ego. The best part of the film was Matthew as Flagg. It could have worked if the casting was good. But I am sure that Hollywood was checking to see if Elbow could be the next James Bond. I hope they got their answer. No doubt they will keep on trying this out, making more films simply to push a political agenda, and sacrificing the fans in the process.

176,Chiller7,Exhilarating from start to finish. I will rewatch this many times.,10,10 October 2017,"This is a unique hybrid of sci-fi western on its surface, and epic fantasy at its core. It's got sorcerers, psychics, cowboys, interdimensional travel, & otherworldly monsters. The cast is top notch. Idris Elba & Matthew McConaughey are captivating every moment they're on screen. The musical score by Tom Holkenborg (a.k.a. Junkie XL) was superb. This movie has everything. What's not to like?It has the feel of a YA fantasy story, with its misunderstood coming-of-age aged kid being thrust into an otherworldly world with magic and danger, meeting allies in the other world, and finding out he can assist in saving multiple worlds, including his own.The sense of scale is grand. We get the feeling that this world is much bigger with a richer history than we get to glimpse. That's what I want to see in a fantasy story. We know they can't fit everything into the movie, but we do get the feeling of this world being vast.As for its action, this movie is another great addition to the ""gun-fu"" genre, like Equilibrium (2002), where shootout scenes are treated with the same stylish quality and mythical reverence that martial arts movies treat its fight scenes. This is a world where a master of guns, a gunslinger, have an elevated supernatural skill-level, where all his shooting movements are impossibly fast, fluid, and precise. Cool stuff.Some cool easter eggs related to Stephen King's other works can be seen here. e.g., Hey, look, it's the hotel from The Shining. Uh oh, it's the monsters from The Mist!As for the critics... ignore them. Just do it. They're worthless. Not just for this movie, but for every movie henceforth. This is like the 20th or so movie in the last three or so years alone that I've watched that I've thoroughly enjoyed, despite snobby critics trashing it and giving it a ""rotten"" score.

177,RLTerry1,Would Be Better Told in a TV Series,5,4 August 2017,"A paint-by-the-numbers ""epic"" story with a prolific number of Stephen King references. Adapted from the Dark Tower series of novels by Stephen King, Dark Tower introduces movie audiences to one of King's masterpiece works of literature. Unfortunately, the movie takes place in the middle of the series and fails to leave audiences wanting to see more. For the most part, it offers up little more than an enhanced SyFy Channel original movie or a one-time HBO film. With a powerhouse leading cast consisting of Idris Elba and Matthew McConaughey, it constantly feels that the actors were held back from that which we are normally accustomed. That is, not to say that there aren't enjoyable parts of the movie--certainly seeing all the King references are fun and it is a great premise. I only wish the story and characters had been allowed to develop over the course of three films. Although there is sufficient evidence to suggest that some movies in the recent past that have been forced into a trilogy instead of a strong, concise single film, this is an example of a one- time film that truly needed the room of three films to develop and emotionally connect with audiences. There is never a dull moment in the film, nor an opportunity to become bored because the film is incredibly rushed and turning points are forced into place.At the center of the universe stands a massively tall dark tower that keeps the bulk of evil forces at bay. Under attack by Walter (McConaughey), the last gunslinger Rolland (Elba) must destroy Walter and his following before they destroy the dark tower and wreak havoc on Keystone Earth and the other planets in the universe. Harvesting children with ""the shine"" from earth, to use their minds to destroy the tower, is the method employed by Walter and he has his eyes on a child whose shine is greater than any other. After Jake (Tom Taylor) evades capture by Walter's henchmen, he finds himself on Mid World where he meets gunslinger Rolland. Under constant siege by Water, Rolland and Jake must make a arduous journey to Walter's headquarters where he is mounting his attack against the tower. With the fate of the universe at stake, Rolland, Walter, and Jake face-off in an epic battle of good versus evil.There is not much to dissect here. One thing is for sure--and I have not read the books--BUT, from what I know of the books, fans of the literature will not like the film because it takes what happens over the course of ""King"" sized novels and condenses it down to little more than a short story turned 2hr film. Not having read the books, I was not set up for disappointment. That being the case, I enjoyed the film for the most part. But it was obvious that it was incredibly rushed and there was little if any development in plot or character. No emotional investment to be found. It's a shame; the premise of the film is fascinating and I think there is a high degree of probability that I would have enjoyed following the franchise had it been more than one film. The way the movie ends does lend itself to possible sequels, but after the very ""television"" feel of this one, it is going to have a hard time convincing future audiences to invest time and spend money on it. If anything, this film does prompt me to read the novels upon which it is based. One argument that could be made in the film's defense is the same one that can be made when looking at many of the films based upon King's works. His novels are so dense, internally driven, and detailed that is is difficult to successfully translate effectively from page to screen. Obviously, there are exceptions to this trend (i.e. the upcoming IT theatrical release).If you are a fan of fantasy and adventure films with a hint of science-fiction, then you will likely enjoy this movie. If you love the series of books, I feel fairly confident that you will not like this adaptation. Perhaps this film will inspire a network to spearhead an epic television series. I think that is where this story will be best shown.Written by R.L. TerryEdited by J.M. Wead",The Dark Tower

He feels that if people are unhappy with the movie or TV series, just read the book. I think this attitude is only one based upon making money at the expense of integrity. Thank goodness his eldest son Joe Hill has much more concern about how his novels are transformed into a visual experience. So far he is 3 for 3 with two terrific movie and one TV series adaptation. My biggest disappointment from Mr. King's attitude is this movie with literally nothing about the 7 novels that took from 1974 through 2004 to complete. The only thing that matches are the only three main characters names out of a main character group in the novels were five and all played significant roles. What would be awesome would be a top quality cable TV series based EXACTLY from the novels from beginning to end. Perhaps Frank Darabont who did Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile would be a top pick to execute this massive body of work into an equally massive multi season TV series.",The Dark Tower

King has, to me anyway, been writing garbage for the last two decades. I stopped reading him long ago. But even then, I didn't let my own prejudice against his work, color my mind in watching this film. The story progression and climax were very good. It's worth the watch.",The Dark Tower

182,aquascape,A disorganized mess of all books combined,6,29 March 2018,"As with any Stephen King film adaptations from his enormous and brilliant catalog of best selling books, ""The Dark Tower"" definitely stirs the pot, will it be on par with the books or will it be just another attempt of the horror mastermind's collection of mediocre adapted screenplays? The answer, unfortunately is the latter, piling up in the big heap of previously forgettable adapted films.The screenplay encapsulates elements from all eight books, this immediately raising a red flag. If you have eight volumes to work the franchise with, why not start from the beginning and base the first movie of the first book? "" The Dark Tower"" is a renowned series among teenagers and it could have stood out in the modern young adult format. I consider that it was the wrong approach into adapting the screenplay.""The Dark Tower"" is about a mythical structure that holds up as the pillar which supports all realities. The tower is targeted for destruction by the Man in Black, played by McConaughey, while the main protagonist, Idris Elba, must protect it from harms way with the help of a young boy. Instead of paving the way for viewers unfamiliar with the books, it muddled by combining elements for the whole series and losing its focus along the way.Considering its development went through many years and in the hands of many directors (J.J. Abrams and Ron Howard), they should have done a better job on putting it on screen, but ultimately it just fades in the vast sea of the young adult genre.",The Dark Tower

184,scottingram,The Dark Tower Film Review,5,24 August 2017,"The new dark fantasy film The Dark Tower based on a Stephen King book starring Idris Elba and Matthew McConaughey.There are other worlds than these. Stephen King's The Dark Tower, the ambitious and expansive story from one of the world's most celebrated authors, makes its launch to the big screen. The last Knight Warrior, Roland Deschain (English actor Idris Elba - UK TV Series Luther, Mandela: Long Walk To Freedom), has been locked in an eternal battle with Walter O'Dim, also known as the Man in Black (American actor Matthew McConaughey - Interstellar, Free State Of Jones), determined to prevent him from toppling the Dark Tower, which holds the universe together. With the fate of the worlds at stake, good and evil will collide in the ultimate battle as only Roland can defend the Tower from the Man in Black.Amongst the other actors / actresses in The Dark Tower includes Tom Taylor (UK TV Series Doctor Foster) as Jake, American actor Dennis Haysbert (Sin City: A Dame To Kill For, Heat) as Steven Roland's dad, South Korean actress Claudia Kim (Avengers: Age Of Ultron, TV Series Marco Polo) as Arra, American actor Jackie Earle Haley (Lincoln, Watchmen) as Sayre, American actor Fran Kranz (The Village, Orange County) as Pimli, Australian actress Abbey Lee (Mad Max: Fury Road, Office Christmas Party) as Tirana, Canadian actress Katheryn Winnick (Killers, Night And Day) as Laurie, Nicholas Pauling (Black Butterflies, Friend Request) as Lon, Michael Barbieri (Spider-Man: Homecoming, Little Men) as Timmy, José Zúñiga (The Call, The Chaperone) as Dr. Hotchkiss, Australian actor Nicholas Hamilton (Captain Fantastic, Strangerland) as Lucas Hanson, Eva Kaminsky (US TV Series Chicago Med, Just Like The Son) as Jill, South African actor Robbie McLean as Toby, Swaziland actor Mark Elderkin (TV Series Black Sails, Dark Tide) as Rat Man, Matthew Thomson as Jonah, South African actor Karl Thaning (Dredd, TV Series Black Sails) as Jake's dad, Leeanda Reddy (Diana, Mr. Bones 2: Back From The Past) as Dr. Weizak and South African actor Kenneth Fok (The Deal, Night Drive) as Johnny.Filming locations in The Dark Tower include cities, places, countries like The Big Apple New York, The City Of Angels Los Angeles, California, USA, Cape Town, South Africa, Africa. Overall The Dark Tower is an alright dark fantasy film filled with fantasy, darkness, violence, shooting, explosions, illusions, things that don't seem as they appear, magic, magical powers, teleportation between places like cities in the real world and other places in the dark fantasy world, a race against time, chases on foot and in vehicles like cars, loyalty, team work, togetherness, some sad hard hitting moments, the battle between good and evil, power controlling and other things throughout the film.So I will give The Dark Tower an overall rating of 3 out of 5 stars and The Dark Tower is a film you can pick and choose whether you want to go and see it or not if you like other dark fantasy films like The Seventh Son, Crimson Peak, Snow White And The Huntsman, The Huntsman: Winter's War, Maleficent amongst others.",The Dark Tower
185,CinePendejo,"It's not DREAMCATCHER bad, but still crummy.",4,7 August 2017,"Considering that I've only read one book from THE DARK TOWER series, I can at least commend it for trying harder than most series. It's a series of probably a billion books that takes references to sci-fi, supernatural, western, and time-traveling iconography to construct an epic that attempts to connect multiple worlds as well as Steven Kings separate books. Totally convoluted yet ambitiously audacious, these books became beloved household staples thanks to Steven Kings true grasp of go-for-broke imagination. Love him or hate him, nobody likes to tells stories like this guy. Sadly, the new movie, directed by someone nobody has heard of and written by the crowning idiot Akiva Goldsman, doesn't do it much justice. In fact, for all its preposterously stupid story, the film boils down to a glib and almost joyless string of second hand ripoffs from other movies. There's no coherency to the plot mechanics or story, the child acting sucks, each frame looks gray and unappealing, the multiple genres that it constantly jumps between looks unimaginative, the editing feels off at times, and the whole thing is lifeless almost to the point of boredom. Yet it's not necessarily all that bad. For all the moments that threaten to make me sleep, at least there's more merit than other Kings films like, say, DREAMCATCHER. At least the gun fights look cool enough, the direction is generic yet competent enough, Idris Elba tries hard enough in here, and Matthew McConaughey was simply cool as sh*t in what is kind of a mix between Voldemort and Killer Joe. (There's even a scene with a family and he's making chicken wings! OMFG). Plus, there's third act filler with the Gunslinger interacting with the real world that feels so cringy I burst out laughing.Not a total disaster, but only by virtue of being so dull I'm almost forgetting it.",The Dark Tower
186,tendobear,The Crap Tower,6,13 October 2018,"I was really looking forward to this when it was first announced to be directed by Ron Howard. Then months and months of development fell through and in the end we have this mess. I admit that the source material - The Dark Tower series by Stephen King - was just too complex, grand and epic in scale to really manifest into a single movie. The movie really does try to focus on the key elements and use them to tell a cohesive story. And I feel that's where it falls apart, it just felt over-simplified and watered-down; the thing with The Dark Tower series is that everything is interconnected, so you can't just pick and choose elements and hope it all comes and holds together. I also feel that the writers really missed the point of the Dark Tower and Roland's obsession with the Man in Black. This would've worked out way better had it been either a mini-series or just a straight up series, because the source material is so rich that it can't be told in a single movie. However, negatives aside, I think they did a great job casting a bad-ass like Idris Elba to play Roland. Elba really has that presence, toughness, and world-weariness to perfectly portray the last Gunslinger. Also good job casting Matthew McConaughey as The Man in Black/Walter, he's got that perfect balance of charm and menace to really bring Walter to life. Except for that, I don't think I can think of more positives. Read the books instead and pray somebody turns this into a series with Idris Elba as Roland and Matthew McConaughey as The Man in Black.",The Dark Tower
187,gdeangel,Remove the Ka-Tet?,1,19 October 2017,"The decision to remove the Ka-Tet seems odd, given that super hero films are going strongly in the other direction. How many people were juiced up to see Wonder Woman lend a hand in Batman vs. Superman. How come so many people pushed Guardians to the top of the box office? Justice League. Avengers. Hobbit. LOTR. Harry Potter. How much with Justice League bring in? Common theme: character contrasts create an RPG-like universe where strengths, weaknesses and skills fit together like a jig-saw puzzle.In the books, that makes for some boring bits... skip ahead and get to the action stuff... but if done right on the big screen, where it can all be done through dialogue instead of narration and introspective, well, you have cinematic gold.The ensemble on the page had: (1) the ultimate bad-a$$ high plains drifter who can't make the decision when to stop killing and save something (you know what I'm talking about if you read the books). (2) the hapless NYC kid grinding though a miserable life, perhaps a young Holden Caufield. (3) the white Junkie knight with a unique code of chivalry (4) the schizo black woman with no legs who starts out a racist and ends up in love with the white knight, and (5) a vampire hunting ex-priest. How do you miss the potential to bring that to the big screen?!!! The writers could have dropped them into a high-rise apartment building and remade The Raid: Redemption (again) but with slow mutants, demons, the Man in Black and the Crimson King (... too soon Dread fans?). It didn't need to have one much connection to Dark Tower cannon to be gold, as long as they cast it right. From the moment Idris Elba was cast, it was suspect that the writers had zero appreciation of how character interaction played in the ka-tet's dynamics. I thought, well, that's nice, but how are they going to handle the Suzanna & Eddie relationship if Roland is black. Well, the answer turned out to be ""Delete them"".Elba is a great actor, but he carries too much moral certainty -- he's too ""upright"". Even when he does something bad, we give him the moral high ground -- a bit like Dread actually. Anyway, instead of that, the writers decided to sacrifice more characters for pace and flattened Roland into ""superman"" with guns. The director has claimed the film is a continuation after the events of 7th Dark Tower book. Well, if that was the case, there should still have been a ka-tet, just like we know of Roland's old Ka-tet from boyhood.All the attention given to magical powers of reloading and defying physics with guns... I hate to say it, but today that is mainly going to entertain gang bangers with gold-plated .45's... or people who showed up to see ""Blade 4 ... Magic Guns"". There was no thought for the fans who waited for decades to see Roland's saga finished in print, who were moved by the post-apocalyptic visions of technological fragments mixed with the supernatural to scour the bookstore for the next installment year after year. Not one of those people I dare say sat through the film and left thinking, ""Awesome, nailed it!"" King apparently was happy with the project. Given the kind of books he's been churning out these days, I suspect he was looking at his paycheck as the worlds left his mouth.",The Dark Tower

I did not watch this in anticipation of it being like the book series. After all, they had already completely changed the main character, and eliminated many prominent secondary characters.

You can probably see how things don't work out great.That being said if you put aside all the things they cut and allow yourself to watch this as an original take on the series you can find yourself enjoying this fast-paced action flick.The Good:
Midworld looks good. There are great effects throughout the film, Action scenes are cool. McConaughey is good as the Man in Black.
Really this is like a Stephen King Easter egg movie. Just watch it to enjoy all the references.The Bad:
Characters: Roland loses his tough gruffness. The first scene we see him we learn of some lame new backstory that adds a weakness haunting him throughout the film. Fans of the series will find it extremely disappointing how they changed his story.
Jake is fairly similar but they give him a damaged backstory making him also into a sad brooding character.
Man in Black is in this much more and his plot definitely overshadows and replaces other big antagonists from the book series but McConaughey's performance is good so overall I didn't feel too annoyed by that.While their are several cons I personally feel they are small and I can overlook them mainly for all the Stephen King references.
I'm not sure whether or not this'll get a sequel, I don't think it should, but if it does I hope it focuses on being a fun fast-paced King Easter egg extravaganza.",The Dark Tower
190,theVade,Another (mediocre) attempt at taking a novelized series and trying to paint it on the big screen.,5,6 August 2017,"The major disappointment with this film was that The Dark Tower is just plain boring. Never enough information for us to care about the protagonist, and too little attention to detail for us to connect with him either. The Dark Tower features some of the worst editing in a film I have ever reviewed, and its visuals are just mediocre apart from a couple of scenes. Idris Elba is the saving grace to this film through both his performance and character, and McConaughey brings some effort to the table as well. There really isn't much more to talk about when it comes to The Dark Tower as it is just another attempt at taking a novelized series and trying to paint it on the big screen. In the end it turns out to be another boring and forgettable film, as its lack of detail and emotion kills any form of enjoyment from this movie. Although I've been pretty harsh on this film, I decided to give The Dark Tower an ""Alright"" on theVade Review Bar or a 5 out of 10.

It may help some that they haven't read the books, but either way, this one is a mess. It's too incomprehensible and poorly written to make sense to anyone. As far as the casting is concerned, they are fine, though I couldn't help thinking all the way through that Matthew McConaughey would have made a much better Roland than Idris Elba. He was more like the character, as envisioned by King (and the many drawings included within the books). It's telling that the film was not pre-screened by critics (they didn't need the negative reviews, as it was going to be hard enough to sell, as is). The only way the books could have been filmed properly would have been a long running cable TV show, but then maybe not (look at what happened to Under The Dome).

I would agree with the person who said this was ""inspired by"" rather than ""based on"" the books and I do think people who haven't read the books so aren't expecting a straight adaptation will enjoy it for what it is.

199,TheJediWay9,"""The Dark Tower"" Tries To Be Ambitious, But Fails.",5,2 August 2017,"""The Dark Tower"" is based on the book series of the same name by Stephen King and is a continuation of that series. The movie focuses on the Gunslinger (Idris Elba), who must do battle with the Man In Black (McConaughey) to stop him from destroying the Dark Tower which holds all the universes together and protect a boy Jake from the Man in Black.I was not excited for this movie at all. The trailers made the movie looks very cheaply made but after seeing this at an advanced screening I have to say it was awful like I was expecting it to be. It also wasn't very good. Idris Elba has and will continue to be a great actor and he proves it with his performance in this movie, arguably being the best of the movie even with the material he's given. Surprisingly, the child actors were serviceable. They didn't suck. I mean I'm not gonna write home about them or anything but they served their purpose and I found them to be decent while watching.For the first 15-20 minutes of the movie, the movie sets up a really cool premise and story that you are hoping it evolves. This first act kept me invested and interested even if the characters weren't all that great. After this section, things started to go downhill.I just lost interest in the movie after that. To be honest, it was a pretty boring and uneventful movie. It's just a series of action sequences and a villain with a big bad plan and little to none of the so-called ""Dark Tower."" My interest waned. It just became something I hoped it wouldn't.Matt McConaughey is not good in the movie. I will give credit where credit is though because he tried, but it did not work. He is not a good villain. He's just not menacing at all, and the villain was pretty bland. This movie is also a very confused movie. Not it's not confusing, but it itself is confused at to what it wants to be. There were times I felt it was trying to be serious, and others where humor dominated the scene and the movie was trying to be campy. That really didn't work all that well either. This movie is also really, really short. Without credits, it's 88 minutes (95 minutes with credits). Like....what? It made everything seem really forced and rushed and the movie had no real flow to it.I am going to give ""The Dark Tower"" a C-.Here is my review on YouTube for a further and more in-depth analysis of my review of ""The Dark Tower.""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2q0qCEDTm8",The Dark Tower

We see things that make no sense logically where they are, we see multiple references to later books shoved in there without adding the actual proper detail, we miss out on amazingly detailed characters that are fan favourites and we get nothing from it. At all.This film is a travesty and I have no idea why King gives it defence when he insults Kubrick's Shining as the only really major differences in that are that the hotel survives.Honestly terrible, just...just the worst.

I got a picture in my head of his smiling face with a tooth missing on the cover of Mad Magazine, saying, ""show me the money"". All that being said, I didn't dislike this movie. I've seen a lot worse lately. (on a positive note, at least no one was looking stupid smoking cigarettes in this movie, heh heh, that's something at least). This was butchery of the books straight up as mentioned many times in reviews. Try to cram that many books into a 1 1/2 hour movie, and you see the results. Can't be done.

The heavily use of CGI was just horrendous. You could just tell the whole thing was fake. There was no need for it to look so bad with the technology from this day and age.The Bad: The movie is just over an hour and a half long which is bad enough, but the fact that the main character doesn't show up until about twenty minutes into the movie is just as worse. Still not as bad the CGI in the end. The movie seemed to be more about Jake Chambers than about Roland and his journey. Which does lead into the good of the movieThe Good: The fact that they did change a lot of the aspect of the movie from the first book and even added in elements from the other books already was the right move. Who's to say that only Roland would have been affected by the fact that the journey is starting over again?Final Thoughts: I loved this movie just as I loved the books.

I love the books and I learned from IMDb in the trivia that this is a sequel to the 7 books. How you gonna have a sequel to films that haven't even been made yet? It works with Lord of the Rings or Star Wars but not The Dark Tower. Now if they had actually made the film called The Gunslinger which is the first book in the Dark Tower series then it probably would have worked to develop an understanding of the characters and what's going on. For me they rushed it. You can't just throw characters out there and expect people to understand what's going on the moment the film begin, well unless you've read the book like myself but what if you've never read the books? Then well you're screwed then because you'll be lost. This film seemed rushed to me. The studio was only looking for an excuse to create prequels or that TV series out of the books which they should have done at the beginning instead of trying to cram 7 books into one movie that's only 1 hour and 35 minutes. The dude who plays the gunslinger was cool. Idris Elba is a good actor so I can't fault him for the role because he had to work with material that was rushed into development because this is the year of the King and they want to bank of Stephen. Matthew McConaughey who plays the Devil was okay but he was a bit overdramatic in his acting I didn't believe he was the Dark Lord from the Underworld. I mean he's an Oscar winner you were giving us Emmy winner performance in this film. I'm glad I didn't pay to see this film, well I did but it was only a dollar at Redbox so not that big of a deal. Don't get me started on that kid who played Jake, ugh his acting was terrible. There's a scene in the film was somewhat sad and he was taking over the top with his crying and making a scene I was thinking of myself lord have mercy go back to acting class and learn how to cry. The film itself the idea of it was cool but when you actually sit down to watch it didn't pan out for me. Should you watch this film, well if you get lucky and get it for a dollar at Redbox then by all means rent it but don't be surprised if you find yourself wondering why they decided to make this into a movie instead of the original idea of a TV show.

211,mrosesteed,Promising but rushed,5,18 May 2019,"Like the series of novels on which it is based, The Dark Tower is a sci-fi-fantasy epic with themes and episodes of horror - supernatural murder, mind control, vampires, Lovecraftian monsters creeping in from the darkness outside the living universe, and overt references to other, related works by Stephen King, including The Shining and It. This ultra condensed, extremely liberal adaptation, which picks and chooses bits and pieces from King's extensive source material, is a fast paced story about finding a place and a purpose, which features high production values and strong performaces (especially McConaughey as the sinister man in black). However, its worldbuilding feels rushed, and much of the film is taken up by clunky exposition and over the top special effects. Ultimately, this concept driven film devolves from a sci-fi-action-horror to an outrageous CGI action extravaganza, which threatens to bury the characters along with the plot.",The Dark Tower
212,HorrorFreak1997,surface level entertainment and nothing more.,5,30 August 2017,"I'll start the review by saying that the dark tower is a major let down. the truth of the matter is.. it's far too short. one must consider the massive amount of source material. Stephen King's books are incredibly detailed and the world he creates is dense with wonderful characters and interesting and thrilling situations. the film simply skims over some of the best parts of the series. the easiest way to put it is, the film is too briskly paced. characters don't have time to develop and the story feels very slapdash. the writing is mostly sidelined for moderately impressive visuals. a massive disappointment is the man in black character. his motivations are very unclear and he ends up being a classic ""bad for the sake of being bad"" villain.overall the dark tower will disappoint nearly every fan of the source material and only moderately impress the average Joe. the production value is good, the acting is pretty good, and the visuals are pretty cool. not a complete failure, because it does entertain throughout, but truth be told.. it's nothing more than a surface level action/fantasy romp.5.5/10",The Dark Tower

215,jeffyoung1,Entertaining enough for those who have not read the books,5,4 August 2017,"SPOILERS: I watched, ""The Dark Tower"" last night. Let me start by admitting I have not read the Stephen King books. This was a good thing because I harbored no pre-conceived notions about the movie. I went to see it because of the interesting movie trailer and the fact I am a science fiction fan. Also I tend to like Stephen King books and movies, even the movies not favorably viewed by critics. This is probably because I have a low threshold for being entertained. If I come away from a movie feeling entertained then that is good enough. I'm not going to watch an artsy, fartsy wannabee Hollywood Oscar contender. I just want entertainment. Therefore, if you have not read the books and want science fiction thrillers, then ""The Dark Tower"" should suffice. I admit that I was somewhat dismayed by all the negative criticism from those who read the books. Subsequently I think the producers should have taken the chance on a 2 to 2.5 hour movie to flesh out the background story and the main characters. In all fairness, if you're a science fiction fan like myself, you will notice typical, often-used sci-fi and action plot formulas in this movie. There's the dark, often, anti-hero hero with his awesome, sometimes exotic weapon or weapons. In this case, the tragic, damaged hero, Roland Deschain, last of the mythic gunslinger guardians of a post-apocalyptic, parallel earth, brandishes a pair of (our) earth-like, late 19th century .45 Colt cartridge revolvers. I'm not sure if the type is Colt or Remington. Its cartridges hold steel bullets forged from the legendary Excalibur sword, making the projectiles, bullets of killing, if being a .45 Colt wasn't enough. Consider the .45 Colt is a longer, rimmed cartridge of the .45 rimless ACP, which has a man-stopper reputation. This is good because that's what's needed to stop the Dark Man, Roland O'Dim's orc-like minion-stalker-killers, who prove to be stronger than even 6-foot, muscular tough guy, gunslinger, Roland. Already one sees the parallels to the Star Wars Jedi knights, the Tolkien world of Middle Earth, and the board game, Advanced Dungeons and Dragons. One might actually enjoy all the parallels if one buys into the fantasy story. The movie just came out so there is still time for the movie to be seen by more viewers, allowing for a more balanced reception. As it is right now, I'm in the minority by giving the movie a middling five (5), because while my minimum entertainment threshold had been reached, even I wished the movie could have been longer to allow for more depth.",The Dark Tower
216,rolandjordaan2,The Dark Tower - Spoiler Free Review,6,14 September 2018,"Even though I had never read the Stephen King series of books that this film was loosely based on and entered the film with just a menial bit of knowledge on what it was about, even I could feel that a lot had been lost here. A Dark Tower film has been in talks ever since I can remember and for the longest time, it seemed like this film was never going to happen...and: maybe that should have been the case. Now, don't get me wrong: I actually enjoyed this movie a lot more than I was planning to; I thought Matthew McConaughey was entertaining as the villain, Idris Elba was engaging as ever and even the kid, although not a particularly good actor, was passable enough to at least not annoy me. Some of the action scenes, especially near the end, were actually exhilarating to watch and the plot moved at a brisk enough pace for it to mostly keep my attention. So then, having for the most part actually enjoyed it, why then do I feel this film should not have been made? Well, you remember when 'Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy' was adapted to film? It was an okay film, sure, but at the same time, you could feel that they were losing so much trying to cut the story down to fit into the running time of an average film, and the same thing happened here. Now, obviously, book series to film adaptations aren't exactly rare and quite often they can be very successful, so why is this an exception? Simply put: because this film was a gamble and they knew it, 'Harry Potter', 'Lord of the Rings' these books had built in audiences of millions that pretty much guaranteed successful film franchises, with Dark Tower though, that wasn't the case and knowing that wasn't the case, they wanted to at least add elements from all over and conclude the story enough to be able to stand as a standalone for if a sequel never gets made...which does seem to be the likely scenario based on how poorly this film has been received by both critics and audiences. So while many other book series adaptations had breathing room to explore their characters, establish them, establish the world and plot elements, this film tries to do that in one 90 minute film and although not a terrible attempt, it simply isn't satisfying. My closing thought: this should have been adapted as a TV series.",The Dark Tower
217,meelaleks,A masterpiece,5,14 October 2019,"This adaption is a wonderful masterpiece! Thats is, if the object was to turn a great series of books from one of my favorite writers into a barely recognisable short movie for teenagers and young adults. If that wasnt the intention... shame on the makers. As such it deserves 1 star (why is it always so hard to turn Kings books into decent movies? -except some exceptions-) As a stand alone movie, largely unrelated to the book its good for a rainy day if you are between 10 and 25 years old I guess, and worth 7 stars.

220,midnightmosesuk,Disappointed....,6,4 July 2019,"This film is a fantasy western, with a great villain, a great hero and plenty of action. But this film is NOT a Dark Tower adaptation.I promised myself that I was never going to watch this film but, inevitably, it turned up on Netflix so I thought I'd give it a go.I've read all of the Dark Tower novels and was even enthusiastic enough about the books to but the comics and other books explaining the Dark Tower universe, so you can call me a bit of a Dark Tower nerd.The first problem was the casting of Idris Elba and I'm mentioning this with some trepidation. I like Idris Elba's work and he's a charismatic and accomplished actor but the character of Roland Deschain was a white man. He was specifically described that way in the books, there were some very good actors like Daniel Craig and Mads Mikkleson lined up for the role, why Idris Elba? I know that many people will misinterpret my thoughts on this but, details like that matter to fans. I looked at the film and said, ""that's not the Roland I read about."" Idris Elba handled the big calibres like a pro and no one can fault his acting chops, but he just wasn't the right guy for the job.There were some little details which they did well, like Roland's reloading trick, his expertise with his pistols, his costume was excellent and the shoot outs were well choreographed.Matthew Mc Conneghy was excellent as always. That guy can just emanate charm and menace all day and never break a sweat. You've just gotta love him.As for the rest, the material really needed to be a franchise and made episodically.

I have read the entire tower series since the very first book came out years ago and always imagined the gunslinger as a Clint Eastwood look alike, and this movie is just a slap in the face of all fans of the series. Why do they do Stephen King's books like this? The series has so much it is impossible to show it in one movie like this. Why did they bother calling it the Dark Tower. All they did was take a few names and then pieced together a story completely void off any real tension, any real sense of adventure, and completely butchered the story line. With the technology we have today they could have made an epic movie series like the Harry Potter movies, studios should know by now that if a movie series is good, people will watch 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8...how ever many movies it takes to really tell the story. I understand that you can't include everything from the books, but to give this crap the name of the dark tower to trick fans of the book series to watch is atrocious. The dark tower is an epic story spanning hundreds of years across different dimensions and different times in history. All the build up to finding the actual tower is full of all kinds of awesome stories that would have made great long movie series. This was just a lazy attempt to cash in on another well know series. I really can't stand Hollywood. That is why I don't go to the movies anymore, why pay someone to waste hours of my life I can't get back. Hollywood puts out this stupid stuff because people watch it.

I really enjoyed myself!I mean, let's face it, there is no way thousands of pages could be squeezed into 1h35m. The movie is based on the Dark Tower series, it is not supposed to portray it step by step. And I think the two main characters are as fairly portrayed as possible. Sure, Roland is a lot more talkative, there are some scenes clearly just for FX show and/or comedy, Jake learned to control his power much too quickly/easily and the gunslinger creed is a bit abused, but overall this was an exciting movie and I found myself enthralled.I was particularly blown away by Matthew McConaughey. How the hell did he manage to create a character that is both so evil AND sexy? I have to admit I had some nasty thoughts watching him. My goodness, how can he just arrive into a room and with one look terrify me? I can't even properly explain it. He's all business. He owns his power and has this innate arrogance to him. Really, I can't explain it, just know this is an incredibly built villain.Gangly Jake was also a pleasant surprise but next to McConaughey and Elba it was difficult for the boy to shine.I actually enjoyed the whole gunslinger's purpose vs revenge. I cannot remember if that was present in the books, I read them quite a while ago, but I felt that was a good theme to serve as the film's motto.All in all, I am really happy with this adaptation and was thoroughly entertained.

234,rs403404,The Dark Tower stands tall in theaters,8,23 August 2017,"This is a deeply flawed movie. It is exposition heavy, frequently redundant, lacking any real characters (aside from the three leads), feels way too small for the epic story, uses elements of sci-fi and realism without any attempt to make the elements flow together, and has a tendency to meander and feel not as urgent as it should. Nevertheless, I still found quite a bit to enjoy.The three leads pivotal to any Dark Tower incarnation are all entertaining. Idris Elba as the stoic last gunslinger, Roland, is serious and deadpan just as he should be. Despite that, his affection for young Jake Chambers still shines through. Tom Taylor as Jake Chambers proves to be a strong young actor capable of showing a wide range of emotions which is pivotal to the movie. Finally, Matthew McConaughy as the near omnipotent Randall Flag isn't as strong as James Sheridan was in the same role in ""The Stand"" over twenty years ago, but is still very effective.The failures of the movie lie largely with storytelling and many could've easily been avoided. We follow Jake throughout most the movie, yet we also learn practically the entirety of Jake's story in flashbacks to scenes we saw in the beginning of the movie, giving us the same scenes twice. There also is a real lack of urgency throughout the movie. Sure, Randall is killing children to use their psychic energy to destroy the titular Dark Tower. Additionally, the Dark Tower is what prevents the horrors of many of King's other novels from invading the world full force. Yet, no one really seems to care about the imminent destruction of the known universe except for Jake.In many ways, the film feels like a missed opportunity. Rather than bring the novels to life, the filmmakers made the choice to do a new adventure with these characters. The entire universe rests on the shoulders of a brief fight between Roland and Randall that the film barely builds-up and thus feels rushed and hollow. Therefore, little or no time is spent to develop (providing the audience even less time to care about) these worlds.Still, I enjoyed the movie despite these flaws. I have read the first two Dark Tower books, so while the sci-fi/fantasy elements felt out of place in the movie they didn't surprise me. The scenes showing us Roland's prowess with his gun and Randall's massive array of powers were impressive making their final confrontation an exciting and engaging event. However, this is not the epic companion piece to the massive eight book series that it should be. But overall, I had fun while watching it.",The Dark Tower

I'm one for thinking watch something and make up your own mind whether you've read the book or not. TBH I didn't even know it was based on a book it was the brief summary about the film that led me to add it to the watch list and so as a form of escapism this kind of film, for me, definitely ticked the boxes.Matthew who I once read somewhere wanted to fine tune his acting skills to being conveyed as more serious an actor on screen certainly seemed to display the character as a quite formidable force and was just as enjoyable to watch as when he plays lighter hearted character roles though IMO it would have been great to see him occasionally add a bit of comical and mischievous natured - unless , I suppose, written in the book version his character doesn't cater for that kind of entertaining appeal. Idris Elba, I recall seeing in an action film once with Jason station and, on that occasion he was playing the bad guy role where I felt his character to be quite irksome so it was a pleasant surprise seeing his acting abilities be better utilised playing the gunslinger role. The young whipper snapper who played the other leading character seemed to also play his role convincingly well too. If you like a bit of action mixed with sci-fi and an easy to follow storyline to tune into and zone out for 90 mins if only to escape from everyday life then it's perhaps a film you may enjoy. If your persnickety and focussed on attention to detail even in your leisure time then maybe your scale of enjoyment will be lower than the chosen rating I gave the film.Thanks to all involved in the creation of this film the work involved imho paid off and made me walk away from the tv glad I'd chosen to accidentally click on this film today from my watch list. In this neck of the woods, we are easing out of the second lockdown and soon the festive period will be upon us.

The grittiness and violence of the source material is missing. The wonders, the amazing characters, the exciting storylines non-existent. This is a bland, absolutely distasteful movie and I think the critics and financial underperformance is saying a lot. It is an absolute mystery to me how Stephen King could have possibly been okay with this, and how can there be even talks about a TV show and a cinematic continuation?

On the other hand you've got a villain played by Matthew McCounaghey as the man in black and basically gives a cool performance as the man in black, emotionless as I would imagine Walter from the comics and the books to be. Roland is masterfully portrayed by Idris Elba and he is one of the individuals who saves the film and I don't care about him playing a white character. Every word he says speaks to your heart especially the gunslinger dialogue. I honestly get the chills everyone I hear it albeit it's repetitiveness throughout the movie. The action is also very nicely shot. No shaky cam like some of terminator films for example. You can clearly see what is happening. There is not much hand to hand to combat and there is a logical reason for that. Roland is a gunslinger and uses his pistols for the most part. I like them having the design of the classic magnum you can meet in westerns. Thank god they didn't modernize them and made them look like Lucian's plasma pistols from league of legends. So yeah, the gun action from Roland is priceless and some of the shots are pretty stylish.

They wanted to show too much in a very limited time and it shot back to their faces.I could see how tremors and quaking could've been whole first part with better dramaturgy and more depth of mystery, with the end of revealing the portal.Second part could've been whole in the Mid Earth, or how ever was called that place and last part could've been back on Keystone Earth with boss fight, that could've been more dramatic.All in all, this movie had it all, except was too short, was very shallow, due to short time, and decisions of key characters were very harsh and unreal. As I wrote in the beginning, this movie missed a lot by it's short play time. Characters literally didn't have a chance to evolve and act accordingly to the situations.There was no decision time, no wrestling with their own thoughts, nothing. Time came in the movie, at least in 5 events, where totally foreign people had to decide A and B without the ability to return to A (e.g. how those Mid Earth people sacrificed themselves for a complete stranger, etc.) and they decided without a whim of thinking.",The Dark Tower

First half hour of the film is really a ho-hummer. Nothing special about the special effects. I would say this is a movie geared to the pre- and mid-teenagers. The language is clean enough for children and others who don't appreciate rotten language. Ugly monsters are often in the dark,so no bad looks in that department. Along the line of what others have said, this movie is most likely more sit-throughable if one knows nothing about the novels.",The Dark Tower
247,jmarinko925,A fun fast paced action adventure featuring characters and scenario's from classic novels!,8,10 August 2017,"The Dark Tower is a film that is beyond ambitious. I noticed at the films end credits it took four screenwriters to transfer the original work to film. While it does not capture the step by step saga of the gunslinger and his pursuit of the man in black depicted in the novel(how could it seriously?)The film succeeds in bringing these iconic characters to life on the big screen in adventurous, fast paced popcorn film. Of course I would of loved to see Stephen King's masterpiece receive the in depth lord of the ring's film translation treatment but I'll take what I can get. What you get here is Roland, Jake Chambers and The man in black on the big screen. The film will surprise those familiar with the original story which I believe is a good thing. Who wants to see a paint by numbers version of a story they already know? Entertaining funny and exciting with the fate of multiple worlds hanging in the balance.",The Dark Tower

I haven't read the book i don't know anything about the original story, i watched this movie with a fresh mind like it's simply a new fantasy movie and wow, i loved it! The only negative for me was actually it being not long enough! It was very fast and intense which i liked. It was so good, but it could have been even better if adding to it at least another 30 minutes fitting another one or two motifs maybe involving more other characters or more about the tower to make the story broader and more complex. Great acting from Idris, Tom and Matthew! Don't listen to the bad reviews guys! The movie reminded me fantasy movies from 80s, when i was a kid and when they were the best!",The Dark Tower
250,benjaminlauriesmith,A confusing and somewhat dull adaptation,6,27 August 2017,"Sometimes great books make for great films especially in this day of CGi when films no longer fall short in bringing to life what our imaginations brought to life in our mind from the pages of the book.Sadly as with a lot of book to film cross overs in this day and age the fan base for books and comic books is not what it used to be and you of course always run the risk of what is someone's imagined idea of what the book characters, setting and story should be will not always translate into what the vast majority of us think it should have been.All that aside this movie is essentially a kids movie that revolves around a child actor (teen) and movies with a child actor as the main star have not done well at the box office since E.T It has a 12A certificate in UK.Yes Edris and Mathew do fine jobs facing off against one another but they revolve around the kid and you can't help but feel you are watching a kids movie rather than a kid caught up in a nightmarish adults world.Ultimately it would have made a better mini movie series on Netflix than on the bigscreen",The Dark Tower

But I found something lying on the desert, as if something were wrong. Maybe I am not alone in seeing this, but I knew I had to find out more. I could see the remains of what was known as potential. I knew this to be potential because it looked like something that could have been a work of genius. And then I realized something. It wasn't the Great Mohaine Desert the man in black and the gunslinger were on at all. This was MARS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Yep! That is what we have here for you folks today! How do you have an endless fountain, wealthy of information and ways you could have interpreted the movie, and screw it up this badly!? Did the director even CARE about the source material? This movie has NOTHING to do with the novels it was based off at all. It just felt like Nicolas Arcel just cherry picked tidbits here and there, at RANDOM mind you, and jammed them all into a 95-minute movie that is a gigantic, discombobulated, egg-battered shell of what it could and should have been. This film bastardized the series so much, I have not been this dumbfounded by such a bastardization since Super Mario Bros., and if you are having me compare you to THAT, you know you burned out! The Beamquakes were bastardized to oblivion, Devar Toi does not capture the feeling I had of it when I first learned of it, the scene of the Plaster Man was reduced to a bloody pulp, just to name a few of things that they got so wrong! Also, if you're going to cherry pick from the entire series, why the HELL did you not cast someone to play Eddie OR Susannah!? They were essential to the entire series and if you're going to include characters A, D, and Q in there, you can throw B and C in there at least so that you have your cream of the crop.Really, what this movie should have done was just base itself off the first book and go the same route the Harry Potter movies went, basing itself off a different installment for each movie. You CAN adapt a 231-page book into a 95-minute, you know. But you just seriously CANNOT adapt over 4000 pages of material into ONE movie that spans for an hour and a half. There is just no way! The Dark Tower series is too big for that, and to be fair, this movie didn't even feel like a true Western like this series very well gets. It just feels forced.I will give Idris Elba points for what he managed to do as our favorite gunslinger Roland Deschain. He sold the role the best he could, but it also adds to how much wasted potential this movie had. You had great actors, the director himself is capable of good products, and The Dark Tower series is Stephen King's crowning jewel. Do you know how sad it is when your lead does the best he can, but the kind of script you put him in is so degrading when it should have been so good? Do you see why I put the wasted potential on Mars at the beginning of this review? It is because this is one of the biggest wastes of potential I have ever seen on the big screen. Oh, and there is a GEICO product placement in the movie that bastardizes it even more. Yep! Absolutely shameless!This movie should have been much more, but as it is, it has failed on so many levels that if the movie were firing bullets and were aiming at my head, they would be so far off they would be useless and in Jupiter while I laughed at it. It got virtually nothing right from the books, turned into a mess, and was just a complete waste. I'm going to leave this review in TRUE Dark Tower fashion, which is more than I say for this movie. It will get a 19 out of 99, and this movie really has forgotten the face of its fathers.The man in black fled across the desert and the gunslinger followed.",The Dark Tower
252,summerinertia,A Homoerotic Smogasborg,3,10 August 2017,"I went into The Dark Tower hoping for a lot. I knew it was low budget, but the trailer and synopsis had me very intrigued. I guess that's why companies have marketing departments. It's probably the only way to sell this film.The set/feel to the movie reminded me of the mid 70's Dr Who show. It was very low budget and almost looked like it was shot on a camcorder. This didn't really bother me however, it's more I'm letting others know what to expect. I've seen my share of low budget productions and I've grown to learn that a strong story or cast can take a movie much more powerful than it's CGI effects.So now I'll get into the story. While the concept was somewhat good, the execution was not. The story seemed pretty basic after the first 30 minutes, however upon the 45th minute passing I realized I was wrong. I guess the writer wanted to make a statement on human interaction, so he decided at the expense of the audience to keep the film going much after one would have assumed this disaster would have finished.I won't ruin the film by saying what happened, but the final scene made my laugh out loud.Not something I'd suggest anyone waste time on. I'm guessing Liondgate made a killing on this one as the hype around the DVD was fairly good. I'm starting to wonder if they may have got the rights for this film for free. I wish I would have got my copy for that price.",The Dark Tower

254,blatherskitenoir,Swayed by Expectations,6,8 August 2017,"As I watched this, I could not figure out why the reviews were so bad. Sure, the worlds it makes gloss over the details and backstory, and some of the gun stunts are ridiculous, but the acting is good, the effects non-cheesy, and overall it's a solid fantasy-tale bildungsroman. ""9-11 year old boys would LOVE this"" was my main thought. A slightly gritty Neverending Story or Shadowhunters for boys and without the romance, it has all the components a tween and below would love: -awkward 11 year old hero going through puberty with a Destiny -mild Angst -guns -tricks done with guns -PG-13 levels of violence -nasty rat creatures wearing fake skin -enough sci-fi to temper the fantasy and make things extra grittier -no kissingAs the movie ended I thought: ""not bad"". Then I saw the credits: ""Based on the novels by Steven King"" And ohhhhhhhhh, the bad review scores now made sense.If you are a serious Grown Up coming to this movie expecting 7 novels worth of Steven King level detail and darkness, you're going to be angry and not like this movie. It's nearly a kiddie film.

The best of the world desperately look for not so much stories as complex worlds to tell unlimited stories in. The whole world of film and pop culture screams ""EPIC!"". Stephen King's Dark Tower consists of seven books. It's an epic, if ever I saw one.Meanwhile this film takes it upon itself to rush through it all in 95 minutes. Of course it is severely suffering from the lack of exploration and depth that is the result. This could have been the material for something great and it would be right on top of our time to spent hours on world building alone, regardless of the plot. It could have kept us breathless throughout seven films (or seasons), could have held us captive for many years to come. Instead it is just wasted away. Not only that: It is not even a moderately good film that became of it. 
The rich and deep characters and the many references found in the book are not just ""altered"" - that would be perfectly fine. It's crippled to the point where it doesn't even make sense anymore. The characters of the film as well as its setting became lifeless cardboard images, the plot is forgettable and meaningless. In the right hands this epic would have been the world of Stephen King, a brand of its own that allows all of Stephen King's stories to be used for material. The amount of creativity, entertainment, inspiration and money this film simply throws out of the window is truly hard to fathom. It's a crime against pop culture we find here. An embarrassing failure and painful to watch - whether or not you are aware of its original background.",The Dark Tower
258,pailoong,A Review from Someone who Hasn't Read the Books,7,5 August 2017,"The thing that jumped out at me the most was the visuals, and this includes the direction. Mid- World was beautiful. It looked like our world (Keystone Earth), but different enough to give you the feeling that you're in another dimension. Nikolaj Arcel and Rasmus Videbaek did a fantastic job with the direction and cinematography. In fact, although I felt McConaughey's performance was a little flat (which may have been a conscious choice to showcase his inhumanity, now that I've seen my thoughts in writing), the way he was presented on screen really helped make him appear ominous (and what he did with Jake's mom with the ""Hello There"" and the magic so Jake would see his mom burn was screwed up. I haven't been shocked by a villain's actions in a film for a very long time). Speaking of acting, Idris Elba was great, as always. He's one of those actors who can tell stories with his eyes as well as his facial expressions and line readings, and he's one of my favorite actors around today. Usually, having a skilled and accomplished actor working with a kid for the majority of the film leads to some very unconvincing performances (looking at you, Iron Man 3) but Tom Taylor held his own against the two big powerhouses he shared the screen with. The action scenes were also great. Gunfights can be boring these days because they're standard fare at this point, but there was some creative elements thrown into the mix here that made them very enjoyable (first thing that pops to mind is Roland's rapid-fire reload with his fingers). Negatively, I'd say the film ended too soon. From what I've heard from people who have read the books, there is a lot of material to draw from so I'm confused as to why they made such a short film. Obviously I don't expect them to make a completely faithful film adaptation, but Peter Jackson showed us that you don't need to follow the books 100% to make a great film adaptation. On a personal note, I'd like to say to those racists who claim Idris Elba's Roland is a ""magic negro"" that you can all go to the devil (trying to avoid using what could be construed as profanity, but you know what I mean). Apparently, having a black man play a skilled warrior and serve as a mentor and father figure for a child who lost his father is a negative thing. You'd think the racists would be happy because a white man was a bad guy, but I digress.",The Dark Tower

It was cool to see a black lead in this adventure movie. Something unusual in Hollywood. With movies like Get out! and this, I hope many others will follow suite to cast more black leads. He is also a great actor handling the character, man in black, very well.Matthew also played a wonderful villain. He strong, commanding and has some pretty crazy powers.

260,markwha,A would be average PG-13 horror viewed as below average film due to an utter lack of respect for the blockbuster worthy source material,2,21 February 2019,"To someone who has read the books on which this film was (very loosely) based, many of the viewer and critic reviews may seem slightly harsh or unfair. To the vast majority of these disappointed critics and fans alike, the more positive reviews should seem unrightfully generous.The reasons for the often sharp disagreements are both few and simple: To a viewer who doesn't know the original story this would be an average (albeit perhaps ""at best"") PG-13 horror/sci-fi film. But to those who know the deeply rich, dark and gruesome story that should have and could have been given better treatment, the only dark and gruesome aspect was the shallow adaption and utter butchering of a truly epic tale and cast of characters. Adding Injury to Insult is the absolute waste of good acting and a triple A cast.In conclusion, what this film should have been was a darker series that could have rivaled the likes of Lord of The Rings or a TV series that of Game of Thrones. What we have instead is a minimally watchable, easily forgettable film, remembered mostly for being the biggest King adaptation let down in the history of its genre.

And then the action starts, it seems that they spent all their money on the big actors, no special effects worth mentioning, especially the mime ""magic"" of the main antagonist, it took some chuckles out of me.The actors tried to play their characters, but even them seemed not to understand what the hell they were doing in this movie.Totally forgettable experience, really sorry I went to this one.",The Dark Tower

Actually, as I watched Idris in some of the action sequences, I thought of Wesley Snipes and thought to myself, Wesley would have been good in this flick. The more I think about Wesley Snipes, the more I think this flick would not be struggling at the box office had it starred Wesley instead of Idris. I would have still enjoyed the movie but struggled with it too. Embarrassingly, I do not know what the film is about; it just did not make sense to me. There were some accelerated jettison scenes – what the heck was that and why? Some of King's stuff is really bizarre. My interest in Stephen King's Dark Tower novels was not peaked.

Why one would still watch and review such a story is beyond me.The acting is very good all over. Especially the young protagonist is very well portrayed by the extremely talanted Tom Taylor. Idris Elba is effective as always, although one could wonder is he's 'just' playing versions of himself.

There is hardly any difficult original source material to deal with, the number of characters has been cut by 99.5 %, the story is only 5 % there, and still the wonderful writers have managed to inject material that was never in any of the books, all while using the original title for misrepresentation. Wonderful. The result of the godlike writing is a mesmerizing tapestry of loved and well known action sequences, almost totally devoid of any value to the story. Why, if one was to change the names of the characters this could be any Dwayne Johnson movie ever. And the cast, ah, the cast. A very talented chap plays the role of the original protagonist from the book, but in a way that wonderfully leaves out all that boring character development and tales of decades, and instead probably adds new color to the performance. Then there's this bad dude, male and white with a touch of demon as per usual, and also a child hero whose merits include dead parents, or at least dead to HIM parents, I cannot remember, but good, right?

Well, I went with some of my family last night to see the film... at the only theater still showing it. Aside from us there was one, yes one, person in the theater watching the movie. The Dark Tower film had almost nothing to do with the books. It had the main character names and a dark tower. Little else resembled the books but I guess an 1:30 long movie won't capture much of a major book series, especially books the size of King type books. The actors were fine, especially the boy actor playing Jake. But the film did not work as an action film or as any other type of genre. Some action but too many check the watch moments. Some character building, but who cared. Some CGI but boring. The best part of the movie was the loading of bullets into the gun... kinda sad.

270,dhenderson-9,"As bad as you have imagined it could be, possibly worse",2,22 August 2017,"The movie was not good. It was a lot of things, but good is absent from the pile of what it was. Idris Elba did a great job with what he had to work with. The entire cast did, actually, though some of the casting seemed too Hollywood pretty. But that's what Hollywood does, right? Visually the film was gorgeous. The creative ammunition loading was fun. The action sequences looked good even in a few spots where the editing was choppy.If you've read and loved the books, spoiler alert, there's really nothing for you here. You'll catch glimpses of images you'll recognize, scents on the wind that strike familiar, but overall you'll be looking more for what's not there than what you'll actually see.So why can't Hollywood make a good adaptation of this 8-book source material? I think it boils down to lack of vision and screenplays written by committee. It feels like the best films are made by the Coen brothers or David Lynch or even the Duffer brothers on the small screen. Scrubs was a hit TV show because it was filmed away from the studio so the execs didn't make it out there much. Twin Peaks was its strongest before the suits got involved. There is compelling evidence that Hollywood ruins its products by simply being involved with them. Maybe that's what happened here. I'm not in the business so I don't know. But as an outsider, Babylon 5 was largely written by one man and it had an intricate, cohesive story. Why, then, can't something as epic as The Dark Tower universe be brought to the screen with as much care? Maybe the Coen brothers should have made it. Maybe David Lynch. Or even Joss Whedon. I'd go see that movie or watch that Netflix Original. I know a lot of people who would. And isn't that really what Hollywood should be shooting for?By the way, I'm giving it two stars solely because the acting was strong and that deserves one up from the lowest possible.",The Dark Tower

Going into the movie, I had in mind that it would be an adaptation of the Dark Tower books; I haven't read them myself and so do not know if there is material for fans to recognize or if everything is fresh.

Regardless, it's another big box office bomb to add to an already-explosive summer.The movie follows Jake Chambers (Tom Taylor), a boy who suffers from nightmares of a giant tower, a dangerous Man in Black (Matthew McConaughey), and a mysterious Gunslinger named Roland (Idris Elba). We learn that the tower, which is located at the center of the universe and is the source of all things, is under attack from the Man in Black. This villain attacks it with the minds of psychically gifted children and personally sets out to bring in Jake for the great power the boy never knew he possessed.The movie isn't without merit. While some special effects were iffy, shots of the tower itself are impressive; one toward the end of the film that simply showed the structure peaking thousands of feet above the clouds made me want to pause the screening and just look at it. I also feel that the film is paced well enough, and even though it isn't particularly long, I was surprised when the screen faded to black at the end. Idris Elba and Matthew McConaughey are pretty interesting to watch. I enjoyed Elba as Jake's reluctant father figure, and McConaughey's character was fairly intimidating in a couple scenes. He obviously hammed up the performance a bit, but sometimes a smiling man in a black trench coat is just what your overstuffed, stupid movie needs.Beyond this, the movie is a failure. The main character is a boy, and that is his entire personality; the movie doesn't give him a single identifiable trait. He has dreams, draws compulsively, stumbles through a portal, and then follows Roland around. Is he smart? Funny? Angry? Does anyone like or dislike him aside from that one bully in that one scene? What does he want? What does he like? He is passively drawn along the film's plot points, and in the end, the story concludes without his input. Spoiler.The side characters are just as bad but are at least forgettable, and this ends up being the sort of movie where you shouldn't expect to care about anything. Whether it's a random 19th-century-style village or bland CGI monsters that we are told are a threat, people, places, and ideas are picked up and dropped in service of the journey to save the tower. There's a prescient homeless guy, there are rat people wearing fake human faces. I could list elements of the story that come right out of nowhere and contribute nothing to the overall experience, and I would have a perfectly long review.I can't help but think of a bonding scene where Roland teaches Jake to shoot his pistol, only to suddenly stop and say that the boy's mind is his weapon. Jake doesn't hold a gun for the rest of the movie, and the scene only serves to teach him an oath from the Gunslingers' past. The boy goes back to following Roland around and occasionally fall into another disorganized, poorly lit action scene.Much like Valerian from a few weeks ago, this movie is a bloated mess. Unlike that sci-fi blunder and its nice visuals, though, this one doesn't have much of anything going for it to make it worth seeing. The material that The Dark Tower produces simply gets lost within itself. Let Jake and the Gunslinger save the universe; you just save your money.",The Dark Tower

279,walleye-42537,"Could Have, SHOULD HAVE, Been much more",5,1 September 2017,"I went back and forth between giving this movie a 4 or a 5, I settled on a 5 just because of the strength of the Actors. Given that, the movie seemed very Rushed and void of many important facts left out from the Book. I am not going to get into specifics, but if you haven't read the book, the movie will be a bit confusing for you. I suggest you at least read the 1st Dark Tower book AND THEN see the movie.I was not overly thrilled with the Casting of this movie. Idris did a good and believable job, but there are many that I feel could have done better. Mathew, on the other hand, as Walter O'Dim was a complete Bust in my opinion. Mathew is just to ""Likeable"" of a Character Actor. ""The Man in Black"" needs to be much more menacing and ominous and M.M. just can't deliver that kind of role. The rest of the casting was ""Ok"". I really think they under-utilized Jackie Earl Haley. They could have given him more range in that character.Maybe it's just me, but most of King's Books just don't translate to movies very well. ""The Stand"" and ""Silver Bullet"" were probably the 2 best Books that worked as movies. But ""The Stand"" was also given several nights of 2-hour events to tell the story. Perhaps if ""The Dark Tower"" does become a TV Show, it will give us more, but I only see that happening if someone like Netflix or AMC takes it over. Regular Network TV will destroy it as they do with most Fantasy/Sci-Fi shows.So, overall, this movie is worth seeing but read the book first to really appreciate the movie.",The Dark Tower

After the gunslinger emptied an armory of bullets, all things started going so fast till you hit the end. It felt like they ran out of cash or something when filming the movie.

Yet again people do it, expecting to see everything like in the books...Idris Elba was absolutely amazing in this movie, nailed the Gunslinger part.

Nothing made much sense and the movie did very little to explain anything about anything. It was set at a brisk pace from one setting to another with brief action in between till the final confrontation with Walter.Eventually I ran out of things to watch and started reading Stephen King horror's. Turns out the picture makes more sense when you read the Book as it turns out to be a rough sequel to a completed series of books called The Dark Tower Series. After that the movie made a lot more sense but that might be too high an entry bar for someone just looking to watch a decent movie with Stephen King's name attached to it.To keep things short, Roland is stuck in a Ground Hog's day like loop. He has met Jake several times before and likely walked by him with a different companion in tow just as many times. The loop resets every time Roland catches up to the man in black but the journey isn't always the same, some times there might be more companions with him on his quest and other times he reached walter and the tower alone and other times certain trinkets or artifacts still remain on Roland even though time has reset, giving him an edge against Walter's magics.",The Dark Tower

Those fans of Stephen King who know all the history and details of the series of stories would do well to realize THEY are in the minority and this is just a good old fashioned Good versus Evil hoot.
If you are expecting a Lord of The Rings type treatment of King's books, be prepared to be, obviously, disappointed.

291,MauritiusVonMailand,Not awful. Not good,5,30 August 2017,"Let's go to the point. Beware of enthusiastic reviews (10 stars?). They are either from people who want to overturn the general bad reviews or from teen dudes whose flagship for excellence would always be the dumb I Am Legend and not the original The Last Man on Earth or the following Omega Man (do not believe me, just watch them all and then make an educated comparison). On the other hand it is not correct to rate this movie with one star. It's just a mediocre product. When judging The Dark Tower, there are only two possibilities. If you have read the books, then the best choice is to stay far away from the Theatre; unlike the massive Peter Jacksons work on Tolkien world, this movie is totally missing the epic spread all over the 8 Kings books. If you are totally naive of the story, then it will looks like a flat and self conclusive, something between a teen vampire book and a TV movie. Idris Elba and Matthew Mc Conaughey: good actors but the latter wins the game by providing a portrait of pure evilness. Elba is flat all over the movie. Guess, that we would have had a much different product if Abrams' proposal of a trilogy intermixed with a TV series to fill in all the holes between one film and the other.

There would have been so many exciting possibilities (as like the Lord of the Rings) to adapt the story, but it stays at 95 minutes (period).

299,emp2687,Bad from any point of view.,1,30 December 2018,"I figure i'll review this in levels of involvement. I believe it is bad on all the levels.First, lets start with the most basic. Lets assume you haven't read the books, nor particularly interested in fantasy and only watched it for action. Yes, Matthew McConaughey is probably the best of this movie as he acts out the evil bad dude with just the right touch of malice mixed with indifference towards his victims. But that comprises about 2 minutes of the movie. Anyway, the actual action is not horrible but I'd say doesn't live up to the modern day fantasy standards set by X-Men, Dr. Strange and other various action and fantasy movies. So, bottom line, action wise this is a pass.Secondly, lets say you are more of a fantasy buff who is interested in the story and mythology but hasn't read the books. Well, this movie is then even a bigger disappointment as it only spends about 5 minutes total introducing characters and perhaps 2 more minutes explaining the mythology of the tower, gunslinger, the wizard, etc... Bottom line, there is no story here.Thirdly, if you have read the Dark Tower books... Oh, boy... This is the biggest disappointment of all. Most of the books characters are simply absent. The few that are present are so in name only but are completely different characters from what's in the books. I'd go as far as to say there is may be 1 character from the books present in the movie and it's the Wizard. Bottom line: no characters, no story, no plot twists, nothing like the books.To sum up, a big disappointment on all levels.",The Dark Tower
300,Kremer-Thomas,That's no Dark Tower adaption...,2,13 August 2017,"It's utterly evil! That was the first thing my wife said after watching this movie. We were surprised that only four people were in the cinema (us included) but after the credits we knew why. We both read the books when we were younger. I liked them but they weren't my favorite. When we heard the movie is around 94 minutes we thought it must be the first part of something epic. We were so wrong.The actors are quite good. We liked Walter, he brought something evil that suited him. Idris Elba didn't have much chance to give Roland what he deserves. Most time you see him shooting. The story was a conglomerate of elements from the books watered down and mixed together. There were some nice hints on other King books but they couldn't help making the movie better. What was it that ailed us so much? Perhaps it was the fact that this movie didn't show the respect the 8 Books deserve. They just took a great name and made something loveless out of it. I know, most King adaptions aren't close to the books! But when I was young I loved IT and I even liked the movie. I just had hope that they make something nice out of it. After this we only hope that they will sell the rights to Netflix and they make an 8 year lasting series out of it. They showed some potential with Stranger Things and some other Series I really like to watch. So there could be a little light in the darkness.There is a last thing to say, for all of you, who haven't watched this movie yet! Save your time and money.

And he was marvelous. He was the perfectly played character that was neither too strong nor hapless nor a ""Mary Sue"" in which everything was perfect. Any one of which could've ruined the portrayal and thus the film.

Also keep in mind everyone thinks Jake is crazy. Fast forward a bit, Jake and Roland meet up, and they travel across a world (Roland's World) trying to kill the man in black and save the tower. I'm sure you can guess the ending.{Intro}. Honestly I had no expectations whatsoever entering the theater, I hadn't read the books, and was not at all keeping up with the early reviews coming in online, so my mind was cleared and didn't know what to expect after glimpsing parts of the advertisements I thought the movie looks okay, so I went into theaters only to be disappointed to be watching another Hollywood Déja Vu.1. The film started off with full of surprises and suspense taking the audience to an unknown atmosphere putting them on the edge of their seats for around 15 seconds before the scene cuts to a Kid, (the kid, the gifted outcast, misfit, who has such amazing powers) But yet I didn't give up, I didn't know the whole story so I was let that little (big) cliché slide. Then we got introduced to Idris Elba's character after getting a better picture on Jake (who is the KID) anyways not deep into the film yet, the audience still trying to figure out the whole story on what exactly is happening here, if this is like a modern Lord of the Rings or just straight up The Dark Tower story ripped from the books. Which brings me to part 2.2. Not having read the books, I do not know if this story is accurate to its Origin, after coming back from the of film I read some reviews to find a mix emotion of The Dark Tower saying it stayed true to the novels, some people loved it and some hated it. Two sides, always two sides. I'm going to be straight up honest, this was one of the most modern clichés I've ever watched it my life, I mean the whole multiple earth and friends who now have turned into enemies who are trying to destroy each other was unbearable to watch it was like reliving some of the worst movie moments in your life. I found Jake to be very close to Harry Potter at some points in the film, people will argue that there was no connection between the two whatsoever but in this split second of the movie I really felt like this Kid was just a big knockoff version of Harry. Then we have the friendship gone to enemies problem, a story which all of us have seen to many times to admit, honestly the only thing that made this The Dark Tower's friendship and enemy scenario bearable to sit through was Idris Elba, I mean for real, that was the only reason I gave this movie such a high rating, It deserves so much lower, but Idris was the only thing keeping this pile of rubble from crumbling down. Which gets us to our third point.3. I really felt a the beginning that this movie very much potential to grow into a ongoing series like the comic book adaptions, but it failed so terribly. When they introduced the villain I was thinking on leaving the theater, I mean Matthew McConaughey is a great actor no question, but there was nothing unique about his character at all. Absolutely nothing, he was just like taking all the bad parts of what makes a great villain and them putting them into a blender to make the Man in Black (who if you haven't caught already, is the villain of the film) and seriously The Man in Black how much more cheesier can you get. For me it really felt like the director thought the whole audience watching were kids, I would've liked it more if they added a little bit of violence to spice things up.4. Lastly, the scenario, it hurts me to even talk about it. Destroy a tower that keeps all darkness away from the worlds in this ""realm"" really Hollywood you couldn't have the thought of a better way to approach that Plot, Oh my bad I forgot you guys just released the emoji movie, so there's no way that could be possible.Anyways that brings an end to my review, hope you liked it, if you didn't I couldn't care less, I you did then click YES button.

I think the person who choreographed the fight scenes in John Wick had a hand in this film because Idris/Roland's fight scenes & shooting battles were SPECTACULAR.I think there were certain references in the film that people who have not read the books might find confusing, yet at the same time I recognize that they had to incorporate more action in this first movie then was actually in the first book or people would doze off. This was the first film adaptation of a Stephen King novel that I felt technology was in step with King's imagination. The special effects were on point. For me, I give the film a 10/10. I have waited forever for this and I so want to see the entire 8 book series play out on the big screen. HOWEVER, I do feel that the last 90 seconds of the film deviate from the persona of the Last Gunslinger, Roland Deschain, son of Steven & Gabrielle Deschain, and last of the Line of Eld. I worry that this character break may turn some people (those who know the character) off.. I totally recommend if you are a fan of the series. I totally",The Dark Tower

313,TwentyWasHere,Another bad King adaptation,3,1 November 2017,"With King adaptations it is usually a miss. Same for this movie. I do not even know where to begin how bad this is.This movie is just an incoherent mess. It feels like the script was re-written over and over again by different writers and then they took random pages from each re-write, went on set and shoot it. The production value is quite high though and the movies is done professionally. But you do not care about the characters or the story at all - if you are able to identify it. The movie is salted with some cool scenes designed to appeal to an young teen audience. But that doesn't make a movie and for sure is not the foundation for a movie franchise.The casting choices are extremely bad for whatever reason. Many of the actors feel like the wrong choice right from the start. Probably a result of trying to attach some names to the project, though they did a decent job.The directing and cinematography is uninspired. All involved parties just did their job and didn't care much about the project at all. They know they couldn't salvage the convoluted mess the script is.Best part of the movie is probably the opening sequence and that is usually a bad sign for any movie. It would have been a better choice to make a TV show out of this and and actually tell a story. I haven't read the books and not planning to do so, but I am sure they have much more story and character development to offer.Not much else to say about this movie. It is the usual bad movie you expect when you hear Stephen King adaptation. You can count on one hand which of the many are decent movies.I give this 3 out of 10 because of a few cool scenes. Don't bother watching it. Though if you are 12 and under and very easily entertained you might like this.",The Dark Tower

316,edithp-37476,"Critics, as usual, get this one wrong.",7,11 October 2017,"So the same 'reviewers' who gave Ghostbusters: Answer the Call 74%, and Wonder Woman 92%, have given this film 16%. They want you to believe that The Dark Tower is 11x less enjoyable than Paul Feig's (according to them) masterpiece of comedy entertainment, that in no way disgraced the franchise by being completely off-tone and well, just horribly-made.Is the Dark Tower 11x less enjoyable than Ghostbusters: Answer the Call? Is it 15x less enjoyable than the poorly directed, badly scripted, morally nauseating Wonder Woman? No, it's about as good as Wonder Woman and much, much better than Ghostbusters: Answer the Call. The understandable issues some fans had with the casting of Roland by a black man turned out to be unnecessary, as the character with which he had his racially-insensitive interactions wasn't present in this film. Idris Elba was, on paper, a very good choice for Roland in these circumstances; he's a fantastic actor with a lot of gravitas. He's wasted in this film however, as he's not afforded a chance to use his winning charisma, and so mopes around rather a lot, which sadly isn't the actors forte. I'm not saying Roland has winning charisma in the novels, I'm just saying that Elba was offered an opportunity to branch out; and sadly he didn't quite grasp it with both hands.But if Elba was unfortunately miscast as Roland, who knows what they were thinking allowing McConaughey to play the Man in Black, also known as Randall Flagg. He just does his own thing - which is what he always does - and normally it's fine in original movies with original scripts, but when he's supposed to be playing a long-established character, it's not fine at all. He's absolutely horrible in this movie, and the main reason why seven stars is generous. Enough said about him the better. Like Elba he's a wonderful performer, but horribly miscast in this movie.So the good things? The good things are probably what make this movie unpopular with a lot of King fans. Instead of getting their rambling epic, what the studio delivered was a young-adult movie with a very definitive beginning, middle and end. One of the reasons King novels don't translate well into films is because he has a lot of trouble with that. He just writes words obsessively, whether or not he has anything of value to say. In his earlier years he had a lot to say, and he gave us the classics like IT, The Shining, Salem's Lot and Pet Sematary; but for decades now he's just been disappearing into his basement to churn out his word-quota and the result is... just, meh. He also doesn't know how to make his story endings dramatic, which this movie does very well. There was just no way that a movie studio was ever going to turn King's rambling, unfocused, narcissistic epic into the movie that would please his fans; so they instead offered us up a Percy Jackson type affair, which is very entertaining. If King wanted to see his vision truly realised, he would have retained creative control over his characters; but he didn't. The reason for this is the same reason he writes obsessively in his basement every morning, to a certain word count. Despite all the words, despite all his success; he's so insecure that he needs to see his name continually on the shelves, or in theatres, to remind him that he is still a successful writer. It's his obsession and the only fault for poor adaptations, lies with him and him alone. Just to be clear on this point, Stephen King is rich and powerful enough to choose his own terms when it comes to selling his scripts. Like everything else in his creative life, he chooses quantity over quality.King fans who don't like this movie? You only have one person to blame.",The Dark Tower

319,Starlitelet,More like The Lost Tower...,5,3 August 2017,"I had the opportunity to watch an early screening of The Dark Tower. I was not sure what to expect, but I know there has been a lot of hype surrounding this movie because it's based on Stephen King's novels.Let's get straight to the point. This movie was marketed as something epic and grand, but unfortunately it falls flat. It seemed like it wanted to be many things, but at the same time it did not know what it wanted to be.Story: It's a rehash of many plots we have seen over and over. I am fine with reusing plots, but this is done borderline terribly. There are too many ifs and whys asked throughout the movie. There are no backstory to where this Mid-world or other communities come from or how they are connected to our world. I saw a lot of potential, especially in the first 15 minutes, but sadly it never felt the need to explain to the audience about their myth and lore. Furthermore, it's supposed to be a grand epic tale, but it takes many easy ways out or disregards the possible challenges completely. The story also brushes off any real emotional depths. There were some comedy here and there that did make me chuckle, but it was not good enough to pull back from the heavy nonsensical plot.Characters: They are very generic characters that we have once again seen a million times. And once again I don't mind seeing a generic tale about generic characters if it's done properly (with heart and soul). However, these characters are two dimensional. Their goals and motives are weak and lack purpose. They are basically black and white. There are also too many ifs and why the characters do what they do. No backstories or justice were given to them. As a matter of fact, there were several random characters who were inserted for the sake of letting the time tick. It gave no true purpose to the main plot. Very pitiful.Acting: Idris Elba and Matthew McConaughey are huge stars, and they managed well with what the script and dialogues had to offer them. I also thought the protagonist, and young star, Tom Taylor, and the protagonist's mom, Katheryn Winnick were great. They honestly deserved better than this movie.Script + Dialogue: I don't understand how these actors can act through these horrible dialogues. The line that the gunslinger always says in the trailer is used throughout the entire movie. It is supposed to carry depth, but it passes off as being cheesy. It's supposed to hold meaning, but it falls under the dirt. There are several other dialogues with The Man in Black that passes off as a two dimensional power hunger villain. Imagine a villain who is finger-tenting while planning something masterful, but take away anything masterful about it. He just looks ridiculous.Action + Editing: There are lack of action scenes, which can be understandable given the runtime. The shooting scenes that we have seen in trailers look pretty awesome, but we don't get much more than what we see in the trailers. Moreover, the editing felt choppy. There are many black out scenes and zoom out of cities or scenery that just felt out of place and took up too much runtime for no purpose.Guys, in the end, despite all the nasty criticism I have for this movie, it was only 1h35min, so I did not feel bored out of my mind. There were a lot of slow scenes, but I was never completely bored because I kept waiting around for ""a"" great moment. It never happened. Even at the climax, I was hoping that it was not the climax. I walked out of this movie feeling numb and content, but then I realized that content was not enough for a movie of this caliber, and I was being too easy on it. The sad part about this movie is that by the end of it, you realized nothing has progressed and it was a mess of nothingness.My 4.5/10 stars goes out to its could have been potential and acting department.",The Dark Tower
320,Blekkhart,Misunderstood and underrated,10,24 November 2018,"I just watched this movie...twice. First alone...I loved it so much I had to watch it again with my 11 year old daughter. And she loved it too. I dont understand all the negative reviews...so many 1 star reviews. And the rottentomato score is also very low. It seems most people seem to think this movie is worse than your average Steven Seagal movie. (?). I find that mind-boggling to say the least. This movie is very well directed. It is well cast and all the actors are doing a great job. The cinematography is stunning. The effects and animations are very well done. The action sequences are well coreographed. The music is great too. Imo TDT is pure fantasy movie gold. Pure quality. In some parts it reminds me of LOTR...even Star Wars at times..with a little dash of Stargate, Stranger Things etc. I loved the story and the whole universe. Loved the Stephen King easter eggs (I spotted atleast two...the Overlook hotel photo and the Pennywise amusement park). Now....I have not read any of the books !! I watched this movie without any knowledge of the books. Maybe thats why I was able to enjoy it so much (?). Maybe the movie is a poor adaption of Kings books...I dont know. But as a stand alone movie it is one if the most wonderful fantasy adventure movies I have seen in a while. It took me back to when I was a kid, remembering all the classic movies I used to enjoy back then. I guess nowadays people want endless Avengers sequels instead. Personally, I think this movie is on a whole different level...maybe they should have dumbed it down a bit and it would have been rated higher. I think this is one of the most underrated movies ever. One can only hope that it will get the recognition it deserves one day.",The Dark Tower
321,robobalboa,Towering Disappointment,3,10 November 2017,"As much as the film's creators, actors, and studio probably wanted to elicit comparisons to the Lord of The Rings, as I watched this film I could only conjure fleeting feelings I had when I watched 2017's The Mummy. Both are bland, without soul, and in the ultimate sense, they failed in the simple concept of allowing the audience to hope for a sequel or a continuation in the film's universe. But where The Mummy tried to do too much and suffered for it, The Dark Tower tried to, or so it seems, not do enough and failed just as hard. There's no real need to give a plot synopsis, because what little plot there is isn't even entertaining enough to regurgitate. Suffice to say that when adapting a series of novels, (or doing a ""sequel"" to the novels as this film claims to be) and there's hardly any story to actually follow, something went wrong on the way from page to screen. Somehow, this film ends up being full of itself and completely empty. The villains are paper thin, the heroes are not engaging and the action sequences that do their duty and show up on screen are so profoundly lame that the film seems dated and not able to even scratch the surface of other modern action movies that operate with a much smaller budget. I had to keep in mind that a film like The Matrix is almost TWO DECADES old at this point and compared to this still seems revolutionary. When a film has a character that goes by the moniker, ""The Gunslinger"" and is this universe's Jedi Knight and he's the last and apparently the most well adept at gun-slinging, you'd expect that the sequences when he uses his (skills? Powers? Training? Inherited gift?) to be fantastic. However, this film proves you wrong whenever it can. The gun battles are full of unconvincing CGI and they makes one wish that someone along the way had watched ""John Wick"" and taken even the smallest amount of influence. This movie fails. Each and every time it could be something good, it fails. Our main character, such as he is, cannot emote in this film, and even though he has ""The Shine"" he fails to elicit even 25% of the awe and horror of that than Danny Lloyd who was at least half his age when he made ""The Shinning"". Idris Elba thinks he's doing a serious drama and only works when he's being used a comedic fish out of water, and even when he's full of sound and fury, you guessed it, it means nothing. McConaughey is full of sleazy charm, but if we don't know what he's doing or why he's doing it can it be said that he's even doing anything at all? He's more interesting when he's hocking Lincolns than in this film. And just a side note about this film's cast, there's a young man cast as a neighbor, who has ABSOLUTELY no affect on the plot whatsoever, yet the camera hangs on him like he's a main part of the cast and every time he ""acts"" it elicited an audible groan. The character serves no purpose, doesn't move plot or character further in any way and is one of those things that when added to the larger problems of the film helps you realize that no one knew what movie they were making.Is this LOTR meets Spaghetti Western? Is this high fantasy meets gritty action movie? Is it camp? Is it serious? Is it anything?It's not good, that's for sure. It's not even entertaining in the way a bad movie can be. It's mediocre and that stings so much worse when the promise of the film is so much more. I wasted my time on this because I thought that 95 minutes couldn't seem so long and I came to find out that, either in the world or in Mid-World that 95 minutes can seem to be a brain-sucking lifetime. HARD PASS.",The Dark Tower
322,mg3331,Towering entertainment,8,20 August 2017,I saw The Dark Tower just today and I think that the reviews have been generally unfair. If readers of the Steven King books on which it is based expect it to be faithful to them they will probably be let down because his novels are just too long and detailed for this to be possible. I have only read the first book of the Tower series so I can't make a judgment. I will say however that this film is highly entertaining and has quite a good story overall. Great action scenes between Roland the gunslinger and the Man In Black. Tom Tyler as the boy Jake is a damn good young actor. I've heard that there are plans to make a TV show from this but of course that will depend on the movie's box office success and the poor reviews won't help this cause either. I personally hope this does happen as this is a good cinema effort and I liked it a lot!,The Dark Tower

As a stand-alone film project, they didn't have that option realistically. So they opted to give us a film based in the same world as the books that should be to that series what El Camino was to Breaking Bad (a bit of familiar world extension) and would also suit audience members that had never read the books. Films DO have to make money, after all. A niche film with this big a budget would be a disaster.But no, we don't get to have nice things because rabid fanboys go all Cabin In The Woods' Ancient Ones and attempt to destroy the world.For what it is, it's a good film. It's not a 10, but I was compelled to give it a 10 to counter all the illiterate trolls that gave it a 1.And those calling it THE worst King adaptation have clearly suffered a concussion or ONLY seen Shawshank Redemption. It's not even close to the worst.",The Dark Tower
327,dastaten,A steaming pile of manure,4,15 October 2017,"As a standalone movie, ignoring that it's based on King's epic series of novels, I'd say it's a 4/10, and I'm probably being generous. It doesn't make much sense, you don't care about any of the characters, and the action is unimpressive. To make things worse, most of the acting feels phoned in.As a representation of King's books, it's a failure of gargantuan proportions. Its failure is the only thing epic about it. I'd say it's a 1/10, and I'm rounding up. I could write my own book just on how horribly the series was adapted to the screen. Take seven books (I'm not counting Wind Through the Keyhole), throw out half the main characters, pick a few key points, throw them into a blender, then cram them into 95 minutes, and you have The Dark Tower.What an ungodly mess this movie is. I haven't been this disappointed in a King adaptation since The Lawnmower Man. And King signed off on this. Stephen has forgotten the face of his father.",The Dark Tower
328,werecow2003,A textbook example of how to screw up a multi-book epic,3,26 October 2017,"Stephen King has some hits and some misses, but the DT series is definitely some of his best work (I think It is still my favorite, but it's close). It's an 8 book epic (counting the Wind Through The Keyhole) plus a few short stories, and he paints a very interesting world that is part western, part post-apocalyptic science fiction, part Arthurian legend, part horror, and part weird abstract mysticism. The journey is pretty epic, and each book brings something new and interesting to the table. So far my favorites are Wizard and Glass and The Gunslinger. Had they chosen to make that first book into a slow burn fantasy drama I am sure it could've made a really interesting movie (though admittedly it would probably require a seasoned director and it could easily become a confusing mess). But of course, that is exactly what they didn't do.In fact, I think they basically sum up most of the first book in two throwaway lines. It's a complete waste of a very interesting book. They then do pretty much the same thing to the rest of the multi-thousand page work, by proceeding to take the bits from the other books that might be the most appealing to audiences with short attention spans everywhere, and throwing them all together in a giant pile of quasi-incoherent garbage. I can't imagine that King liked this adaptation. Pretty much nothing remains that resembles even the spirit of the original work. The few bits and pieces that are semi-recognizable feel more like poorly executed fan service than like integral parts of the story. They call it a ""continuation"" of the book series, but that's complete nonsense too since it's about how Jake and Roland meet and go on a quest to save the tower/kill Walter.The movie is told from Jake's perspective, which is another huge mistake, made in an obvious attempt to fish for cash by catering to a teen and YA audience. Since they threw out the original story entirely, they try to give him a new and interesting introduction, but they fail even at that. Mostly that is because the movie is a giant pile of half-finished ideas from the books that they don't have the time to execute well. Only the most minimal explanation is given for any of the things that happen during the movie, and all of the important events are dealt with in an absurd hurry. For example, the word beamquake is mentioned but there is no explanation of what the beams are, let alone any concept of a journey that follows the path along the beam. Convenient portals are everywhere. At one point, Roland figures out Walter's location, and when it is pointed out that it's about a 6 month journey, his response is basically ""how about we take a shortcut?"". This feels like a moment completely lacking in self-awareness because that is how this entire movie feels.In the books, Jake has to get over his own death, twice, once at the hands of Roland, and it nearly drives them both insane, but also helps solidify their bond. In the movie, there is none of this, and we are instead presented with another one of these clichéd chase scenarios where it is now Walter pursuing Jake. In the book, Jake and his future friends almost die when trying to (allow him to) cross over. In the movie, he just tells the house demon ""let me go"" and he's pretty much safe, courtesy of his unrecognized psychic superpower. He knows how to recite the gunslinger's creed before he's even heard it once and becomes a great shot and a gunslinger in two pulls of the trigger.Gone is Roland's centuries long obsessive quest for the tower, his complex character, his backstory, and even some of his character traits (like his courtesy and patience). None of the other main characters from the books even make an appearance.Almost none of the weird mysticism and disembodied horror remains, nor much of the idea of worlds unraveling and the boundaries between them eroding away. This is instead replaced by run-of-the-mill Hollywood-esque psy-powers, default reptilian monsters and mediocre looking mutants, with the tower just an empty McGuffin that could easily have been replaced by the Transformers' all-spark or the Avengers' Tesseract with zero change in the story or even feel of the movie. There is very little of the western feel left other than the fact that there are deserts and Roland uses a sixshooter.The entire movie feels somehow small in scale. That's partially due to its length - with its 1:30h runtime it simply doesn't feel like a long journey - but also in large part due to the poor storytelling and even lack of impressive visuals. Even the special effects, while not terrible, are not all that impressive by today's standards. FX would not have cured what ails this film; not by a long shot. But the books do paint a vivid picture of Roland's world that could have been visually arresting. But they failed to do anything interesting with it at all. There's almost no world building and we only see a small glimpse of Roland's world, with about half the movie taking place in New York. Even the Tower just looks like a CGI rendering of a black Burj Khalifa. It all feels like an afterthought.It's not even good if you don't compare it to the books. I'd say it's a 2.5/10 if you're a fan of the book series, and maybe a very small 5.5/10 if you don't know and don't care about the books and happen to like YA type action movies, but that's being very generous.",The Dark Tower

The movie really allows itself to be enjoyed even if you did not read the book. Is that such a bad thing? If you want to see a bad movie adaptation of an original story, go watch the Last Avatar...that is a truly terrible attempt. This one wasn't. It just focused on one element of the book and milked it well.

335,perval,The Dark Tower is disappointing and has some problems but it is watchable,5,17 August 2017,"The Dark Tower is a disappointing attempt to adapt one of the most beloved Stephen King book series.The movie is not awful but mediocre to fine.Its biggest problem is the duration(95 minutes).This film tries to develop the main characters but fails to make you care for them because you don't spend much time with them.Especially the third act of the film was extremely short and felt that it had no impact.(I don't say that movies with relatively short duration aren't good or don't have character development that makes you care for the characters i.e.Unbreakable) The Dark Tower's antagonist isn't just one dimensional but also his motivations are very cliché and are barely explained.Another problem I had with the movie is that it tries to set up sequels,spin offs,prequels e.t.c.(they are already planning a prequel TV series) but barely shows the world that it introduces to the audience.To tell the truth this movie had some great things like the performances by Idris Elba as the Gunslinger and Matthew Mcconaughey as the Man In Black.I also enjoyed that the movie had a lot of Easter eggs and references to other Stephen King movies. Overall it was disappointing but still enjoyable and it wasn't anything special.If you are a fan of the books you are going to be disappointed but if you just want to have a good time at the cinema you could check it out.",The Dark Tower
336,Alania_K,Why did I watch this abomination?!,1,13 February 2021,"In my opinion, The Dark Tower is the most incredible story ever told, and this is what they did with it?! The plot is completely butchered and missing about 99,5% of the story, and the characters share the names from those in the books but almost no characteristics. To me it felt like someone decided to slap King in the face with the worst possible adaptation of his greatest story.If you read the books, skip the movie, seriously! If you haven't read the series, skip the movie and read the books instead.",The Dark Tower
337,gotmyorangecrush,Yet another weak Stephen King film!!,4,6 August 2017,"This film reminds me of the situation surrounding the making of The Lord of the Rings trilogy. The film was turned down by one studio after another as none of the studios wanted to commit to making 3 films. One of the studios actually agreed to make it, but only if the script was condensed into a single film. Thankfully the people that had the rights and were pitching the films understood that the idea of translating the entire Lord of the Rings trilogy in a single film was a laughable proposition and the end result would have been a terrible film that would ultimately do no justice to the source material. They were willing to bring it down to 2 films instead of 3, but the studio wound up turning them down. The final studio they approached was New Line and because all of the other studios had turned them down, they pitched it to New Line as a 2 film series as opposed to a trilogy. Amazingly, New Line agreed to take on the project but only if it was made as a trilogy. Clearly someone at New Line smartly recognized that Lord of the Rings was an amazing project and the only way to do it right was to make it a trilogy. And anyone who has read the Lord of the Rings trilogy understands first hand that there is just way too much material to be condensed into a single film or even 2 films. And as we all know, the films wound up being a HUGE success and made New Line billions. At last look the Trilogy had made more than 6 billion world wide. Like Lord of the Rings, The Dark Tower series is just way too big to be condensed into a single film. Any film studio that was legitimately serious about doing the Dark Tower series justice would understand that right out of the gate. The Lord of the Rings was 3 books and the running time for the extended versions of the films was 682 minutes or just over 11 hours long. .The Dark Tower series is 8 books and many of them are BIG books. Anyone who thinks that amount of material can be condensed into a single film is living in la la land. I knew going in that this was going to be a cheap attempt at making money off of Stephen Kings name and the popularity of The Dark Tower series and that's exactly what it was. The Dark Tower series is one of my all time favorite book series, as is Lord of the Rings, and this film is literally a bad joke compared to the source material. How they got Matthew McConaughey to sign on to this film when he has had such an amazing run the last 4-5 years is simply beyond my understanding. I will never understand how such an amazing writer has had so many terrible films made from his books. Bottom line - this was a terrible film, one that does no justice to the source material at all. If your a fan of the Dark Tower books, do yourself a HUGE favor and skip this film. Its like a bad joke of the Dark Tower universe. Everyone involved with this film should be ashamed of being a part of it. The only reason I saw it is because I have a nephew than basically begged me to take him to see it and I have to admit, part of me was curious to see just how bad it really was and in that regard it didn't disappoint. It was just as bad as I expected it to be. This is Hollywood garbage, nothing more and nothing less. Do yourself a favor and put your money elsewhere.",The Dark Tower
338,stilloopless1,Tower of Power,10,5 August 2017,"I've been a Stephen King fan since my sister introduced me to his writing more years ago than I care to admit. Ultimately, I loved the Dark Tower series. To say I had an initial bad reaction to the series ending (a twenty minute profanity laden tear) is something of an understatement. While some of the films based on King's work haven't lived up to their potential, I had high hopes that this one wouldn't fall into that category. Sai, thanks.Blessedly, the folks behind The Dark Tower haven't not forgotten the faces of their fathers and have delivered a spectacular film version of the novel. Breaking my movie curse and reigning supreme in the process! Not surprisingly the film is quite different from the book. However, it perfectly captures the essence/spirit of the story, characters, and themes without missing a beat, in an expertly pared down amalgamated version of the original source material. Moreover, if you've never read the book(s), don't worry. You won't be lost, all the pertinent points are hit and you will enjoy the story. If you have read the book(s) and/or are familiar with King's other works, bonus!! You won't be disappointed and there's the added enjoyment of the film being chock-full of Easter eggs as a homage/reward to the Constant Reader.The casting is perfect. Idris Elba as The Gunslinger and Mathew McConaughey as The Man In Black meet and exceed expectations in their respective portrayals. A pure delight to watch these two in this one. Going in my only worry was for the character of Jake Chambers, played by Tom Taylor. I'm unfamiliar with Taylor's work, but this kid delivers, big league. The writing is A-rated. As is the editing, special effects, and cinematography. While the storyline is dark as most apocalyptic tales are, it's never brooding or depressing. It also contains a good amount of laugh out loud humor to keep things from becoming morose. I found this action packed film thoroughly enjoyable, entertaining, and thrilling from beginning to end. At a mere 94 minutes running time, I never felt rushed or cheated. In fact, I appreciate them not padding the film out and dragging it down as a result.No, The Dark Tower isn't a direct adaptation of the book(s), get over it. However, I don't feel it suffers as its own film as a result. I also love the fact the way things ended, it can be a standalone, one and done film, or we can delve back into the world of The Gunslinger. After all, there are other worlds than these. I for one am hoping for the latter. In the interim, I look forward to adding The Dark Tower to my film collection and many repeated viewings.For your father's sake, cry off and see this in the theater. It's a 10 from me.",The Dark Tower
339,edwardgamper-0-128609,Remarkably pacey and moving movie about parental loss and the fear of death,7,30 June 2019,"I hadn't read the books so have no dog in the fight over the accuracy of the adaptation. So I thought this film was pretty good actually.The lead actor playing the boy (who has visions of the tower and the gunslinger) is really good.I was ready to switch off based on reviews, and child actors are often the weak link, but he doesn't annoy and does actually a great job of selling the emotions of fear and grief that are central to the plot.Again, not knowing the books meant I really didn't mind Idris Elber being cast as the gunslinger and thought he did a great job.As did Matthew McConaughey, who I found actually quite menacing. And given his larger than life personality off-screen, I was surprised I didn't laugh or start thinking of one of his silly mid-00s rom-coms once!The Dark Tower movie reminded me a lot of the vibe of the Never Ending Story, taking place between two worlds with the protagonist having lost a parent and the threat of an encroaching darkness on the universe. The Dark Tower captured a similar, almost 80s kids movie tone (without being obvious or trying hard to reference 80s kids films) in the way kids movies from that decade often contained dark adult themes and just the right amount of violence and creepiness. Again, I dont know the original books and am sure book fans are upset it's not as adult as the King novels.This film certainly doesn't deserve the 1 or 2 stars many are giving it. Its genuinely enjoyable and moving, with some great action scenes and a great chemistry between all three main actors.It's certainly worth giving it a try on Netflix. I put it on, absolutely ready to turn it off after ten minutes, but it held me to the end. A sequel was obviously hinted at in the final scene, but I'm less sure about where that could go. For me, the thing that rooted the film and gave it dramatic tension, was the main characters' journeys with grief and loss over their fathers. Unless a sequel could develop on that somehow, I'm not sure it wouldn't end up being just a kind of boring cowboys and aliens buddy movie. But I'd definitely be interested in seeing what they did if one was in the works.Give this film a shot if you don't know the books and just see what you think. It's a great popcorn flick that didn't deserve this panning.",The Dark Tower
340,wileyschmitt,No Expectations = Enjoyable Experience,7,3 August 2017,"I've been looking forward to seeing this movie for a few years, I've read all the books including the more recent one ('The Wind Thru the Keyhole') and other books that Walter appeared in. It's currently 2017, and anyone who hasn't learned the 'book to movie' lesson by now needs to finally learn it so that they can also enjoy movies what they are, which is an extra bonus for a book that is well liked by a lot of people. If the movie actually turns out good than all the better, but being more realistic about movies not having to live up to the books they're based on is best thing to do so you don't end up like the rest of these bitter people who leave the movie theater as quickly as possible just to come back home and write a 'nerd'tastic negative one starred review expressing all their deep down inner angst in the most pathetic form possible. Luckily I beat many of them to the punch before they tore this fun and entertaining movie apart, and I did find it entertaining thanx to having zero expectations about it, go ahead and try it next time you go to a similar movie, you'll at least temporarily enjoy yourself. Whining and complaining about trivial things isn't good for you or anyone else anyways.I thought they did a fairly good job considering all the various challenges that this potential movie presented them, and the fact that it at one point seemed like it may never even get released or get just get much further delayed didn't make the project seem as promising as it did when first hearing about it's production a few years back for the first time. I got my expectations up very high when I first heard about it, but as time went on I would settle for just about anything decent, and 'decent' it sure was, though I'll rate the movie a 10 to make up for one or two reviews from the Negative Nancys of IMDb. I'm happy to see that Sony left this open for a sequel, It's still not a for sure thing if they'll make another, though King seems to think they will, but I'd pay a lot of money to see a movie based of the backstory from 'Wizard and Glass'.Bottom line: Have fun, it's a fun movie whether you have read the books or not. Not a bad choice for the kids either, lot of action, no nudity, and not much cussing from what I recall, (12+ is my guess depending on who you are, ratings can be deceiving).If you haven't read the books: Read them if you're an avid reader, you won't regret it, but if you're just an average reader then the 8 books will take you far too long to get thru and you'll probably give up and have wasted a lot of time trying. One trick is just to be disciplined enough to read every single day if possible, and it doesn't even have to be much because it will add up over the course of year, and if you were to read 10 - 15 pages per day every day you'd be able to finish 'The Dark Tower' series within one year. (Quick easy formula: 365 days per year, very roughly 365 pages per book, so 5 pages per day will get you thru 5 books per year, and not difficult at all to make that 40 pages per day, and at the end of the year you will have read 40 BOOKS! Probably more books than you've ready in your life, just got to form the habit first and go from there, keep track with a notebook to stay disciplined if you have to). Other King suggestions: 'The Shining' Even better than the movie, and possibly underrated because of the movie's popularity, and the fact most people are too lazy to read. 'The Eyes of the Dragon' Walter is a main character, and King once again digs into the darkness of the man's psyche while weaving a great story in Medieval times. 'The Stand' The ultimate apocalyptic adventure with Walter doing what he does best, and the fate of the lives of dozens of different characters all linked to Walter thru their dreams of him, and has 1000 or so pages to all find each other and come together to somehow stop him while avoiding much betrayal and many obstacles along the beaten path that is led and aided by their other dreams of another character who is out to help them find where they need to be going. 'Different Seasons' No, it's not a story about a possessed spice rack) This book includes four novellas (short novels). Most of you will recognize of 2 or 3 of the others as those were all turned into good movies ('The Shawshank Redemption' 'Apt Pupil' and 'The Body' AKA 'Stand By Me'), and just as is usually the case are far superior to the films, and not that the films are bad at all. It's just the reality that books always beat movies, it's no contest at all, but movies are a time for us to do something unproductive and be happy while doing it. So don't be like these sad saps who would actually pay for a movie knowing very well that they'll not have a good time. One of the secrets to life is 'to have a good time when you're able to', and if you like to laugh at bad movies that are trying to be serious then you need to finally get yourself on the MST3K and Rifftrax bandwagon.",The Dark Tower
341,morin-a-philippe,Good action/adventure flick,6,8 June 2018,"All I've heard going before watching this movie was how bad of an adaptation of the book series it was. So I didn't gave it a chance and pretty much forgot about it, but tonight I had time and I thought ''why not'' and decided to watch it.I have to admit I haven't read the books, so my opinion in judging if the Adaptation is good or not won't be there. I can just judge the movie for what I found it to be, an action/adventure movie and in that aspect the movie kept me intrigued, the main actors were all pretty good in their roles despite a lack of big characters arc development, the story line wasn't too complicated and there was enough fantastic in it to keep me interested. I can't help but feeling teenage me would have loved that movie much more than I did.I can understand why people hated that movie, they expected some grandiose and epic story on the level of Lord of the rings or something, but what they got is a 95 minutes adventure family movie. It wasn't anything special either, but it was pretty solid. From start to finish the story line was well respected, it wasn't trying to pack lots of content in an impossible format, there wasn't much plots holes, at least nothing that made me say ''what the heck is going on'', it was just a entertaining adventure movie.I can't help but feel sorry for the fans of the books, but at the same time this movie as a movie didn't deserve the hate it got.",The Dark Tower
342,joshualawrencepike,"Its worth seeing just for the interesting and vast world it shows, let alone everything else",7,11 August 2017,"Before I start I will note I have not read the books (will change that when I get a chance).The first and most important thing that The Dark Tower did was to built a large and complex world(s) without being an info dump or sacrificing everything else to do it. When needed it even let you just absorb the scenery. It reminded me of Guardians of the Galaxy Volume One in this respect.The plot was not huge and complicated. While all the necessary bits were there many of the why's were not explained. Honestly I am okay with that, if I can think of several reasons for an action and which one is true does not matter then I don't really need details. The movie does that several times for several things. I like the idea that the movie respects me enough not to feel the need to spell everything out.The action was good, I really liked the way they showed Roland's gunslinging, he could do ridicules bullet bouncing and such but nothing too out there. He did nothing that could not in theory be done if you were good enough and had enough information (unlike say curving a bullet). They also showed the man in black's magic well, it was consistent and logical the way he used it. He was far from all powerful but he was smart and knew his limits. The final fight was made much better because of this, it would have lost all its punch otherwise. I will say that main character wise the movie does look to be of two minds, it seams to flip between Jake (the kid) and Roland. This does not hurt the movie as much as you would think but it does make me wish the movies was a bit longer to allow for more development. As far as characters go one thing I did not realize until after I left the theater was that Roland treated Jake as an adult. There was no cliché having to prove himself an adult phase.I really did like the movie, even if I think the characters could have been developed more. Its worth seeing just for the interesting and vast world it shows, let alone everything else.www.JoshuaLawrencePike.com",The Dark Tower
343,criticadelcinema,Hollywood turns Stephen King's magnum opus into something painfully average.,3,5 August 2017,"Well at least it's not The Emoji Movie?The Dark Tower had all the potential in the world. I mean what can go wrong with a screenplay based on Stephen King's most notable book series, two amazing lead actors in Idris Elba and Matthew McConaughey, and a decent budget? Right...right? This is a film I had been truly looking forward to, despite the negative buzz that it had been generating. Unfortunately, this is just another example of King's outstanding novels being absolutely mangled by Hollywood. The Dark Tower ends up being just another generic sci-fi film, despite it's unique source material. Elba and McConaughey try their best here. The pair's performances as the Gunslinger and the Man in Black are honestly the only thing holding this film up. Even Tom Taylor, the young star of this film, tries his best with the cliché filled role he is given. All of these actors are simply better than this. The script is largely responsible for this film's failings. True, it is always hard to please book fans when you adapt a popular novel to film. Most books just don't translate one-to-one to film. But even if you put the source material aside, this is one of the most bland, uninspired scripts put to film so far this year. Nothing about this film feels original, and everything about this film feels rushed. The Dark Tower also makes the bizarre narrative choice to focus on it's least interesting character. Instead of giving the spotlight on the far more compelling characters of the Gunslinger and the Man in Black, we instead get a film largely about an uninteresting child protagonist. This is obviously just another attempt at capitalizing on the young adult film trend. Please let this trend die Hollywood. Please. If you read the books, don't even bother seeing this. If you haven't read the books, you'd be better off waiting until this film makes it to Netflix. This isn't necessarily a bad movie, just painfully average. With that said, there are far better films in theaters. Don't waste your time with this.",The Dark Tower

SMFH.anyways, well I was expecting this might be a fail just from the trailers alone. When I first heard of the possibility of the movie I was fairly excited to finally see the story of the 8 books come to life. However that excitement was quickly replaced with doubt when they started the casting and told us they'd replace Roland with a black male...why!? apparently it's all to do with being ""progressive"" and ""politically correct"", when I found out the director is a big SJW type I got really worried. I hate when politics get involved in my stories... Yet I still hoped for the best and I like Idris as an actor so I watched the movie anyways. Man was it bad and was I disappointed as hell. The story is a jumbled mess from start to finish, taking little bits and pieces from the novels and creating their own version of a sequel of sorts and it's just all over the place. The acting is even horrible and I am quite honestly very sad with what they've done to one of my favorite books. Hope this director is never allowed to ruin another piece of literature ever again...

345,Moody2008,A rushed SF western,6,18 August 2017,"The Dark Tower seems like a rushed movie. You know there is more to the story but you feel like there isn't enough time to tell everything there is to tell. There are a lot of holes left to fill and to the more imaginative person you feel cheated because you did not get an explanation for what is happening.The movie is part action, part SF,part western,part thriller.It is enjoyable and the actors do a good job, although there does not seem to be enough time for character building. The scenes are not breathtaking and could have been improved when taking into account it is a Sci-Fi,but probably it needed a bigger budget.Although the story follows the road to maturity of a young boy,this movie is too fast paced to allow for such a complex plot-line. It reminds me of ""The Mortal Instruments"" to some extent and the story is similar, only you have to replace vampires with cowboys and wizards. You can really feel the influences from westerns.All in all it was enjoyable, but I kind of feel I want to know more about the story, so I will probably read the books.Hope you enjoy it!",The Dark Tower

350,rprice01,The Dark Tower Leaves A Lot More To Be Desired,6,5 August 2017,"I am a Stephen King movie and book fan, so I had been waiting for this movie to come out for quite a while now. Even though I've heard mostly mediocre or bad reviews on this film, I still wanted to go out to support one of my favorite authors, Stephen King, and also a favorite actor Idris Elba in his lead big-screen role. I was even originally hoping that this film would be a theater trilogy masterpiece like the Lord of the Rings or the Star Wars franchise. Due to the book series and its large fan base, this movie had so much potential to be great so despite the recent negative buzz, I went on to view the movie anyway and judge it for myself.When I saw this movie, I wasn't exactly thrilled by it, but it didn't exactly leave me disgusted either. Actor Idris Elba did a phenomenal job as the Gunslinger. I was captivated every time he was on the screen and I wanted to learn more about his character. Matthew McConaughey also did a great job playing ""The Man In Black"". He was the ultimate face of evil and I thought that the two actors played the classic battle of Good vs Evil well in the movie. The young actor, Tom Taylor did a great job playing the kid Jake Chambers, and although I was kind of nervous about him at first and wondered what great job his character would bring to the table, I can honestly say that by the end of the movie I was very pleased with his performance as well.The main problem I had with this film was the pacing. It did feature a few monsters and creepy characters, but their scenes seemed to move along so fast that I felt that I was barely able to connect to any of them. The movie which was 95 minutes, also seemed to go along so fast that although I was on the edge of my seat throughout it, as soon as I felt that the movie was going to great places, the end had already come. It went by really fast. There was so much more that I wanted to know about the Gunslinger, the ""Man in Black"", the Dark Tower world and other parallel universes, that the ending left me feeling a little hollow and like something was missing.This is a decent film in my opinion, but not a must-see horror or action movie. I was a little disappointed because the book series franchise is a classic to many fans and I had hoped that movie goers would get a taste of that excitement in the theaters. This movie gives that energy in some parts, but I felt it way too rushed and leaves a lot to be desired by the end. I like Stephen King and really want to see more of The Dark Tower series presented in film in a powerful way that it is in the book series, but this movie is only a taste of greatness that this franchise can offer. Hopefully Hollywood can give it a better shot next time.",The Dark Tower
351,rafaelsimer,It's good. Had potential...but it wasn't used.,5,8 November 2017,"Well, you know, I was never into Stephen King. I don't like his books, they lack creativity and cohesion. It's always ""something horrible and grotesque happens in an horrible way to an innocent victim"". But, why? ""Oh, well, because it's horrible. And it's grotesque."" It makes no sense. I read a lot of his stuff, I tried to like his work. Couldn't.I watched lots of movies based on his works, including both versions of ""The Shinning"". And the one about the haunted mansion, and the one about the big storm that the dude kept saying ""Give me what I want, and I'll go away."" Did he say what he wanted? No, not until the end of the film...that took almost 4 hours! The only movie I liked was that one about the old gypsy that curses the dude that killed his daughter and makes him grow thinner every day. That one was cool. So, yeah, I watched this new film called ""It"", and it didn't change my opinion at all. Boring and made no sense.But I decided to give this ""The Dark Tower"" a try. I knew it was about a saga of 8 books, that many people loved that saga and it connected all his previous works. That was a cool and interesting idea. Besides, I really like Katheryn Winnick as an actress (and of course, she's a goddess of beauty!). I was inclined to like it.And, OK, it's a cool movie. I did like it. Yes, it's very short. And yes, it leaves a lot of blank spaces, like: what are the other worlds? What are those men in black? Who are all those people? Why are those theme park toys all around that forest? What's inside the tower? How come it doesn't protect itself? Who's the ""crimson king""? Why the bad guys only used children? Where did all that high-tech come from? Well, I could go on...Putting 8 books inside 95 minutes of film is a failure. People who didn't read the books feel like there's a lot of stuff missing. And people who did read the books left the cinema feeling insulted. We still don't know: is it a prequel? A sequel? Is it the story itself? What happens now, if something indeed happens?Yeah, it's a cool adventure flick. I liked watching it. The characters should have been better used, the plot could have been better shown. It's like that ""Constantine"" movie with Keanu, you know? A nice film, if you forget it's about Constantine. This is a good film, if you forget it's about an 8 book saga written by S.King (the so called ""Horror King""...dunno why). I was a bit disappointed, since the saga is so famous and has many hardcore fans and all. Same way I felt after watching ""Warcraft"", disappointed, offended. I thought ""T.D.T"" would be grand, scary, thrilling, shocking...but I didn't feel much, just entertained. The entire movie I was like ""this could be a cool PC game"". But, honestly, I don't see any chance for another movie or the TV series people are talking about. Not unless they start from scratch.So, hum, if you're bored, don't know what to watch and aren't expecting a grand master piece, you can watch it and like it. It's good. But it doesn't live of its expectations. But it also isn't as horrible as Neil Gaiman's ""Stardust"". God, that almost made my brain bleed!",The Dark Tower

354,midworld_traveller,One more time around the wheel,7,14 September 2017,"Idris Elba and Matthew McConaughey are deservedly cemented in my mind as Roland and Walter from here on out... they and Tom Taylor saved this film from being a meh five-star offering. Don't get me wrong, I loved it, but I loved it because as a fan of the books, I was getting a tantalisingly convincing window onto Mid-World. It was extremely faithful in atmosphere and visualisation. I also enjoyed the hell out of the gunfights, thought that the Taheen were well done, loved the small nods to the books that were scattered throughout. Plenty to love!The stripped-down plot and changes were inevitable, although it was hard not to begrudge every minute that could have added a bit more back-story, or hint of the canon. The ending suffered from the film's apparent need not to hold us up for too long... choppily edited into a montage of all-manner-of-things-were-well, including orchestra burst and the sun back-lighting the Tower.Not the worst ending in cinematic history, certainly... but it left me with a lack of closure, principally because after multiple iterations of the same quest, Roland carrying the Horn of Eld on his back strongly hints that this is not just a mishmash of our go-round-the-wheel that we know as Constant Readers, but a different iteration altogether, perhaps the last one, Roland's redemption. And for that to be acceptable, I would need a lot more information than was handled in a 95 minute film...... it'd probably take, like, at least seven books.",The Dark Tower
355,raiderhrhr,Horrible disservice to a great story,1,9 March 2018,"I don't care if this is one of the other wheels of the Dark Tower universe stories and not based on the original story. McConaughey is terrible as the man in black, and any story from the Dark Tower universe should start with or at least have a voice over that states: ""The man in black fled across the desert, and the Gunslinger followed him."" I'll give the movie a pass for not ending that way also, since it could have been the last wheel in Roland's story, but come on, this movie just plain stinks. I doubt any others get made if they are like this garbage. The out takes on the disc are better than the stuff they used for the release. Geez.

That's as far as my allowance for ""artistic license"" goes.The rest of me wonders why you want to do a screenplay for a book if you plan on making it nothing like the book, yet claiming it IS that story? Seems very unwise because even an idiot should know that will piss off fans of the book and subsequently 75%+ of the box office watchers.I really hope movie makers pay attention to reviews.The only thing this movie shared with the books is the character names and that Roland is a gunslinger.I liked the acting. Idris is brilliant in every role he plays. Matthew also did a great job as the cagey, evil, Walter. So it had all the makings of a great movie...but for me personally, it just left the path too far.i hope Nikolaj wises up if he plans on any sequel(s), because there's time. The first book was slow and about halfway through the second the story took off and I was hooked. So, stick with the story and leave your own telling for a story YOU come up with. Read some reviews.

Critics have no room to complain.Watching this completely blind, not knowing anything except Matthew McConaughey was a bad guy in it. There were moments of depth throughout that told me this was adapted from a novel by an imaginative writer - my intuition was correct. I imagine if you read the books you'd be upset by how brief and condensed this was, but I loved it.Cheesy and hammy in 3 or 4 scenes. The mother and step-father dynamic didn't make any sense. Some of the Matrix-like combat scenes stretched credulity.

367,madmax3,yeah... so... NO.,2,19 October 2017,"as a person who read the books, I was surprised to discover that they were making a film from the books, consider the length of the saga, and all of the places and details, a TV series seemed to be a better fit. then I figured that they might be doing a movie based on the first book, sort of a lord of the rings saga. still, nope. instead, it seems like someone took the time to read the books, write on a paper important places from the books, and some people, and then decided to re-create the story. still I figured, not a bad thing. after all, the books are far from perfect, and maybe if they'll just concentrate the story into one movie, we'll get a super amazing movie. after all a lot of movie series never get completed due to low interest, so why not just make one great movie instead? sounds good? so yeah.. NO! first they decided to make the hero of the movie Jack the boy, who was a part of the gang in the books, but not the main character for sure, and by doing so, telling the world, that this movie is aimed to be a PG children adventure movie. second, they didn't include all the characters from the book, then again, how much can you possibly shove into 90 minutes? the ""bad guy"", the man in black was very one dimensional, and really uninteresting. and the thing that amazed me the most was the fact, that from a saga of books so detailed, they managed to produce a movie, with little, to no plot at all. this was nothing more than ""lets make a movie to make a quick buck"". the worst of it was the ending. I will not get into details, but lets just say that it was an annoying back to the future ending. the acting was solid. Idris Elba and Tom Taylor did their best with what they had, even though they didn't have much, and as for Matthew McConaughey, it seems like the director told him to watch as many 80's teen movies that he can, and then act like the jerk in these movies. again, not really his fault that the movie was bad.if you are a fan of the books, then this movie is not for you. it has little to none to do with the books. if you are someone who is looking for an adventure movie, to watch and enjoy, again, avoid it. they battled forever to make a movie based on this show, and this one just isn't good enough. but in today's world, maybe a reboot in the future, will fix things up.....",The Dark Tower
368,LWSheffield,"We need a bigger, bolder sequel",6,17 October 2017,"Having not read the books, I was left with so many questions after watching this movie. My score is not great, but I definitely want to know more about the gunslingers and the universe this takes place in. I just felt as though they dramatically underestimated how much of this world the audience could absorb and decided to settle for a short and sweet approach rather than giving us some of the more superfluous detail that might not have carried the story forward as much, but would have helped paint a bigger picture of the context in which all of this takes place. I felt the casting let this film down slightly, again not for the reason you would expect. it was far from bad, in fact it was too good. Elba and McConaughey are both excellent actors, but in this case I could not see beyond them and believe the characters they were portraying. Their performances were both to the high standard you would expect, but their prevalence in cinema and television has perhaps slightly overexposed us to them to allow them to believably become such far removed characters. The action scenes in this movie are very cool but they only further serve to tease you with something you would love to see so much more of. I sincerely hope this gets a sequel and they are braver in their future approach, fulfilling the potential this movie so clearly has.",The Dark Tower

But to take seven (or possibly eight) books and take it down to an hour and a half does a great disservice to the series. The acting is good, the plot is feasible and it works, except that so much is missing.

373,clairesmaybin,Sorry but dreadful,1,15 August 2017,"I'd got past knowing that King's inspiration and mental image of Roland was Clint Eastwood - and Idris Elba, no matter how good an actor and how handsome he is, does not conform to the image that readers of the books had. Fans who have watched ""The Mist"" will have clocked that distinctive silhouette and the rose on the painting at the beginning. Nevertheless, I'd got past that. I didn't realise until reading reviews here that this is meant to be a sequel. My bad. However, I still think it was awful. What's with all the electronic stuff, and Walter having a whole HQ full of people? I didn't expect King's books to be condensed into a single film, but I did hope for some similarity, somewhere along the way. And for book fans, leaving out that first line: """"The man in black fled across the desert, and the gunslinger followed."" is just unforgivable - that tableau is genuinely what I expected to see.Yes, there were boring bits in the books - it was a very long story after all. But I was looking forward to seeing Eddie and Susannah and Oy! Especially Oy! And the drawing of the three, and Blaine. To summarise, I erroneously thought that this might be the first in a series of films (like Harry Potter, which spanned many years) that would tell the story. It actually bears little relationship to the books apart from the names, and for that reason I give it one star. The other reason for one star is that it simply isn't, in my opinion, very good as a standalone (which is what it should be viewed as). Disappointed and gutted.",The Dark Tower

I'm not complaining about Roland being black. Elba did a great job with what he had. Ditto with McConaughey. They just aren't right for these roles. Elba just seems lost. If he was going to play a character from the book, he should pay Cort, not Roland. I can readily see him fitting into the role of training gunslingers. As for McConaughey, he still comes off as he does in his comedy roles and I can't take him seriously as the man in black. This casting also breaks a large amount of the dynamic between Roland and a key book character, Detta Walker. The rest of the story is a weird mix of the first and I guess fifth or sixth book. This means there's no real exposition of any kind. This really should have started on the first book and ran from there. The whole thing is just confusing and messy.",The Dark Tower
377,danhall86,Is it as bad as the critics and fans say?,7,22 August 2017,"In short, no. (BOOK SPOILERS AHEAD) To be absolutely clear, I knew this film was coming so picked myself up the book set (all 8). I read the first book and got partway through the second before watching the movie. But I also knew about lots of upcoming events in the books and also knew how book 8 ended (I knew about the horn of eld, the cyclical nature of the series and Roland's doom to keep reliving the same journey until he finally gets things right.) So I went into this film KNOWING it is technically a sequel to book 8, and this is the most important factor to acknowledge before viewing this film. It's the next time round the wheel, so things will undoubtedly be different. It's not an adaptation. It's a follow-up.How is the film then, with those things considered? It's good. I actually thought it was very good. Characters were right on the money (Elba isn't white - big deal/get over it - he was just 'right' for this character) and McConaughey is literally the visualisation of how I imagined the man in black. It felt like part of the book world, obviously excising the violence and adult themes. Oh and the gunplay was fantastic - the shootout near the end with it's tonally perfect score by Tom Holkenborg was a cracker. So many subtle references to the Dark Tower world and the interconnected works of King. It was FUN to watch, so hardcore fans of the books might not like that transition from dark, borderline horror fantasy stuff to 12A vibes. 12A or not though, lots of people get killed.There are negatives of course. The man in black's little minions were a bit irritatingly cliché, but they served their purpose. The ending was a little abrupt, but I think this affects the whole film. It could have done with being longer (hoping for a director's cut on bluray).I would try harder to convince others of the under-appreciated merits of this film, but I quite enjoy being one of this film's few actual fans. I will be watching again at the cinema, finishing the books, then watching it again.",The Dark Tower
378,ct_brandon,(Spoiler-Free) Couch Potato's Review,7,4 August 2017,"Writing this review with some knowledge of the source material beforehand, I felt the movie was a nice addition to the overall story of The Dark Tower & it's effect on the universe entirely. The film serves more as a continuation of what is already in play left off after the last page of book #7, therefore, those unfamiliar with said material, may find themselves unsure of certain plot points or dialogue and their references to what has already been previously established. I felt the actors really played off their characters and moved with the tone & pace of the film. Visually stunning and amazing cinematography with plenty of angle & dolly shots to keep the pace of the action moving forward. I felt that the runtime was really fast for the story being told, and found areas where they felt rushed to get through the story. As with the novels, the film could've been broken down into several films to flush out characters and story lines. I really enjoyed the film overall and hope we will see more of the Man In Black & The Gunslinger, as their story is far from over.",The Dark Tower

It reeks of a studio that clearly doesn't understand the Dark Tower story and the importance of getting it right. The script is absolutely abysmal, it is packed with lazy writing and bears scant resemblance to, for me, some of the best books I have ever read. The casting likewise is so off it is staggering, Jake Chambers is awful, Elba completely miss cast and as the the Man in Black...sheesh The epic tale of Roland of Gilead is reduced to a dull and boring film that does away with everything that was great about the books.

382,NoPantsBatman,So much more could've been done,6,9 December 2017,"To be honest, when I started watching The Dark Tower I imagined it something like Sauron, from Lord of the Rings. I was wrong. The main plot of the movie was the defense of the Dark Tower, which is located in the center of the universe, protecting it from the darkness outside.It's actually a really good idea, unfortunately just wasn't really well executed. We have the main villain Walter (Matthew McConaughey), and we have two ""heroes"", a kid, Jake (Tom Taylor), with special abilities (when compared to people of his own world) and a guardian, Roland (Idris Elba), of the Dark Tower, who has a vendetta against Walter. It's a really good idea because it gives us a new concept of god and so much could be done around it, but they had to focus on drama, for unknown reasons.The movie itself has a decent pace, I was able to follow every part of the story, without the sense of rush or of it being unpolished. The director Nikolaj Arcel was able to provide a good character familiarization, and the kid, Tom Tayor, made an amazing job, I really enjoyed watching him on screen.An awesome concept for a movie, although I expected to see more from the Dark Tower itself. An infrastructure protecting the whole universe, and zero focus were given to it, disappointing. The drama would be good if in less quantity, if you put a title on a movie you should live a bit by it, just saying.

The first thing I want to say is the movie is really nice. If you are a fan of The Dark Tower novels, go and watch it. The best part of the novels for me was the strong characters of The Dark Tower. So, the movie needed great actors in the first place. Matthew Mcconaughey was breathtaking as The Man in Black. Idris, was also really good. In the movie, they explained everything about the Tower unlike the first book. When I have finished the first book of the series, I almost had no idea about what the Tower was. They gave enough information about the tower for the people who haven't read the books. (***Spoilers in the next paragraph***)There is one thing I didn't like about the movie. Roland is the last gunslinger and he swore to protect the Tower. At least, that what happens in the novels. In the movie, he has already given up about the tower. He was chasing the Man in Black just for revenge. (The Man in Black killed his father.) The will of protecting the tower was the thing made him Roland Deschain, the last gunslinger. You can't easily take that away. The Dark Tower was his obsession and because of that he abandoned Jake to his death (not in the movie). Without that will, the movie was just about the conflict between the Gunslinger and the Man in Black.Except the absence of Roland's will, I almost liked everything about the movie.

I do read; I read quite a lot actually. I avpid Stephen King as a general rule though because I read Pet Cemetery and It and they both freaked me out. He IS a great story teller. He paints a picture with words that sticks with you.
I will also add that I love science fiction and fantasy. Give me alien planets and knights in shining armour and I'm in. I also believe in good over evil.
This for me was very entertaining. The kid was good, with his psychic ability and I love that he was an artist. I also like to draw and paint. The kid was pretty good in this, really believable. Idris Elba was great as the Knight in shining leather who has something in common with the boy in that they have both lost their fathers. Every kid, every adult has had that experience where we know or feel something is or isn't right and no-one believes you, so that should resonate with just about everyone, McConaughey was excellently creepy as the devil like character ""the man in black"". My husband and I kind of giggled at the name thinking of Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones...lol. Roland's knight like character reminded me of King Arthur or Lancelot or Gallahad before they mentioned ""Excalibur"" so I guess that was intentional.

My review is mostly relevant to people who have read the books and wonder if they should give the movie a try.Where's Eddie? Susannah? Oy? I can forgive the missing story of his childhood. But everything else is wrong. Roland is there, and Jake, and Walter. The breakers are a much bigger part of the story than in the books. He never makes it to the field of roses. The rest of the story doesn't much relate to the books.Now to the good. Idris Elba is a brilliant actor. The dynamic between Roland and Susannah makes their races significant, but with no Susannah it's irrelevant. I love Matthew Mcconaughey as Walter. The breakers are exactly as I imagined them.I really wanted to like this. If I hadn't read the books, I might have been able to.",The Dark Tower
392,klotzilla-1,This movie is badass,10,4 September 2017,"I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of this film. I wish it had been three hours long. And, no, I'm not a fan of the novels, although I may dive in. But any film this decent that enrages the finger-sniffing fanboys of the online world gets an extra star on IMDb from me.Admit it: Idris Elba and Matthew McConaughey are brilliant actors well cast as the mortal opponents in a cosmic struggle of good and evil. Telling their epic tale through the boy Jake Chambers (Tom Taylor, also worthy of praise) is an inspired narrative device that appears to be much of the sand in joints in the fanboys who trash the reputation of a highly worthy film.Like Watchmen, another excellent film that irritated fanboys, The Dark Tower is a wild ride across an action packed multiverse.I want more. Lots more.",The Dark Tower
393,Nuri_B,Which Tower?,1,10 December 2017,"I stopped reading fiction about 10 years ago and started to read mostly about the philosophy of science. One of the reasons why was the Dark Tower series, seeing multiple and unbounded universes Stephen King created out of thin air using nothing but time gave me such an awe, I had to explore everything about my universe. When I saw the names ""Ron Howard"" and ""the Dark Tower"" I felt like a kid a day away from Christmas. And then I saw this 90 minutes of heart-wrenchingly awful story which had nothing to do with any of the things the Dark Tower was about. It was as if they decided to really shoot the entire series but after shooting a few scenes they just gave up and handed the script to a 10 year old kid to adapt the scenario into an essay within 2 days and told the kid that he'd be graded on it.I don't know how involved Stephen King was in this movie, but if I were him and someone made my life's work into this short ""movie"" like this, I'd be really REALLY angry.",The Dark Tower

He has managed to do this more than once. He did it with Winter's Tale, taking an epic beautiful story and reducing it to 90 minutes of slush. Same with The Dark Tower. There is no way this could ever be a single movie in the first place, if anything it needs to be a series on the scale of Game of Thrones.As far as the movie itself goes, the actor playing Jake was great, as was Idris Elba as Roland, but there was essentially no story to this film.

396,fwhill,"Great Acting, Great Story",8,23 August 2017,"Despite of all of the negative comments and reviews, I read the Dark Tower series and nothing was going to keep me from seeing it brought to life on the screen. Saw it today and I thought the movie was great! You may or may not know that it took more than 20 years to finish the series. It is a complicated saga, which cannot be told in 95 minutes. And with a $60mm budget, I don't believe that was intended. The point I think was to give people enough of the story to make them want more. Mission Accomplished. Let's do a sequel because we know the Man in Black is not dead, Three of the key characters in the series: Walter, the Man in Black, Jake and Roland are brought to life perfectly by the actors who play them in the film. Walter is seriously evil, without being predictable or over the top. Jake has a special gift and is ""different"" than kids his age. All of us have experienced to some extent what it's like not to fit in and Jake makes us remember. Roland is haunted and determined to avenge the gunslingers who were defeated by the Man in Black. It's like he leaped out of the pages of the book to the screen. The interplay between those people, two fighting to prevent the destruction of all worlds and one hell-bent on accomplishing that is what gives the story the glue that had fans begging for another installment. Great special effects and action scenes. I had fun watching it and I think you will too!",The Dark Tower

If the genre is Mystery it Horror it is not that easy to score superb rating, but this time I wonder: is everybody harsh on the acting, on the story, or is it about something else? Here is my take on it: When I was young, I enjoyed the books. They got me confused and I did not considered it to be best piece of literature. That is exactly what happened when I was watching this one: confusing, strange and not that easy to digest. Guns versus Monsters ? Never worked! But if you want a slow Django, half-ass Monsters , a connection to new York and Lord of the Rings , why not? And Matthew , you did good. On the downside: the Movie feels Long, very long, so thats a downer, no doubt.",The Dark Tower

Its a shame they didn't do it right and make several great movies instead of a 95 minute rush job that didn't do the books any justice. The movie just fell flat. No character building what so ever. I don't expect movies adapted from books to follow every line but come on! Way back when I first read 'The Gunslinger' I thought about how I would love to see this made into a movie, and that's just the first book. Then years later I hear they are making a movie! Yes!

400,Movie-Scene-by-Temo,As long as the tower stands the two worlds will stay divided.,6,28 February 2019,"35 years ago Stephen King began the seven book series The Dark Tower with the sentence and paragraph, ""The man in black fled across the desert, and the gunslinger followed."" That novella was The Gunslinger and director Nikolaj Arcel (A Royal Affair, Truth About Men) had the daunting task of writing the screenplay summarizing several of the widely loved books and comics and presenting them on screen. As the man who wrote the screenplay for another book series with fanatical followers, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, he was well up to the task.The Gunslinger, Idris Elba of Sierraleonian and Ghanaian parentage (Beasts of No Nation, Mandela, Luther (TV), The Wire (TV)) and The Man in Black, Oscar winner Matthew McConaughey (Interstellar, Dallas Buyers Club), are two giants in the acting world. Elba is commanding in his performance with dramatic action sequences and provides occasional humorous retorts, but McConaughey's talents are definitely underused. There is nothing threatening about him and his handsome face rarely changes expression. As the most psychically advanced of the three, the film would have been served by portraying him with dark, menacing, dramatic audio visual effects. The young Jake is realistically played as a teenager not aware of the full extent of his abilities and how to use them.The movie is partially filmed in South Africa's Karoo desert and interiors in an old shopping mall in Cape Town. As in The Mummy, starring Tom Cruise, which was filmed in Namibia's Namib Desert, the desolateness of the environment goes a long way in providing mood and contributes to the hardship we know the characters must go through to achieve their goals.The Western as a genre speaks to individualism and pioneering, a world where government/social law do not apply. Westerns have largely given way to sci-fi films which are modern day Westerns set in ""other worlds."" Seemingly, the sci-fi genre is leading us to the ""final frontier"" which is the mind and ""the supernatural."" The movie is a mash-up of horror, the supernatural and sci-fi, but each protagonist uses one thing, their mental abilities, even The Gunslinger who shoots physical bullets by mental control following The Gunslinger creed:""I do not aim with my hand. He who aims with his hand has forgotten the face of his father. I aim with my eye. I do not shoot with my hand. He who shoots with his hand has forgotten the face of his father. I shoot with my mind. I do not kill with my gun. He who kills with his gun has forgotten the face of his father. I kill with my heart.""It encompasses the Hermetic Law, ""As within, so without, as the universe, so the soul"" and also several metaphysical and spiritual principles on the ability of mind over matter. Beyond this it's an entertaining movie. Go watch and leave entertained and perhaps with food for thought.",The Dark Tower
401,Q-Panda,Everything's just too darn fast,6,12 November 2017,"The Dark Tower is part of a really good movie. The problem is that it's a seemingly random collection of pieces of a good movie.McConaughey's and Elba's performances are top-notch—they both clearly understand their characters well and can make the roles seem effortless. There are other good performances, but they're all so short that you don't get much time to appreciate them.The final battle between Roland and Walter is depicted exactly the way a final battle between two immensely, supernaturally powerful characters should be: brutal, messy, and SHORT. There's no beating around the bush.With so many things to like, it's a shame that the film ends up so ultimately disappointing. And it didn't have to be that way.The big problem is that everything happens just so fast that there's no time for the viewer to understand or absorb what's going on. It's a combination of the movie being so darn short (barely an hour and a half) and trying to fit a story drawn from seven lengthy novels into a single feature film of *any* length, much less 90 minutes. Even just an additional 30 minutes would have given the film some breathing room for character development and plot exposition.I cannot recommend this film based on fidelity to the books, or quality of writing, or anything else, save one exception: It's worth seeing for Elba's and McConaughey's performances. Beyond that, this is just one more entry in the long list of ""should've been better"" films of Stephen King writings.",The Dark Tower

406,byjillian,"Supposed to be a cross between Lord of the Rings and The Good, The Bad and The Ugly",4,4 December 2017,"I even went out and read the first book, before I saw the movie. Let me revise.I went out and read the first book, then I watched the first 10 minutes of the movie and went 'HUH?', and THEN I went and read the second book right away (The Drawing of the Three). I wanted to make sure the movie wasn't jumping ahead to say, the second novel, spoiling it for me.Stephen King, if you're by some miracle reading this, I just want to say that I truly enjoy all your novels, and have been since I was very young. I've read almost all your novels, and have my own 'King' favorites (Salem's Lot, 11/22/63). But shame on you for allowing this goofy movie to be made. Did you really write off on this script?When I read the first book, I was instantly transported. Stephen King's description of the vast, sweeping, endless desert in any direction with that dry, dry head had me keeping a water bottle near me at all times. That unnamed gunslinger chasing a 'man in black'...We don't even know Roland's name until we get to the first village in the novel. The way you describe the buildings in that village, dust-covered, aging, the wood leaning but never giving into the dust storms. I live in Arizona and have gone hiking around here, and the way you describe those old buildings, that vast desert? You did your research.The darkness that seems to drape over the landscape, over the characters. It's like I was reading about Blondie (Clint Eastwood) in The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly on a mission like the Lord of the Rings. The characters are so deep, so entrenched, and so complex.This movie is just so beyond any of that, with shallow characters that are so wooden, I wouldn't be surprised if Kristen Stewart (Twilight) named this her most favorite movie.This is coming from someone who enjoyed the Harry Potter movies for what they are: They are movies set apart from the books. While the movie can be different, sure, but don't make it so far beyond that it's almost impossible to tell it was really based on a Stephen King novel in the first place. Where is the heart of this story? The desert, the solemn man known as Roland? With this movie, it's stripped down into a money-making machine.Come on Hollywood, we deserve better.",The Dark Tower

I don't know what to say but IMDb ought to find a way to fix their voting.Spoiler....it has been awhile since I read the books but wasn't the man in black killed by the spider creature?

Sure, I know that there is soooooooo much more in the books, because there always is and things are always cut and condensed and that's not fun for fans of the stories (still mad about all the cutting from HP & the Order of the Phoenix).

417,pippin_evil_genius,"A Dull, Mundane Mess That Slaughters A Beloved Story",4,4 August 2017,"As far as fantasy series go, Dark Tower is my second favorite. (Lord of the Rings is the first, of course.) Stephen King's magnum opus is a wonder to behold with rich lore, fascinatingly complex characters and a plot that was far ahead of its time. Unlike this lazy film, the books are engrossing and draw inspiration from vast sources ranging from King Crimson to JRR Tolkien's Lord of the Rings and Sergio Leone's The Good, The Bad and The Ugly.The books read like an epic poem, with Stephen King drawing influence from famous poetry such as Robert Browning's 'Childe Roland to the Dark Tower Came,' and TS Elliot's 'The Wastelands.' He even went as far as naming the third book, The Wastelands. The novels are wonderful and tell a truly incredible tale full of love, hate, betrayal and a classic good versus evil.It's a dark fantasy story with exceptionally adult themes and graphic violence. The story is also long. The books take place over 4,200 pages and over one million two hundred thousand words. With story elements ranging from time travel, world travel, paradoxes, Arthurian legend and the multiverse theory, the series was named as unadaptable for film. And unfortunately, it looks like the skeptics were correct.The Dark Tower is unadaptable for a film. The books are too dense, and the story and lore are too complicated to roll out in just a few hours. If the series was given the Game of Thrones treatment by a major TV studio such as HBO or Netflix, then we would be sitting on something undeniably special. Interestingly enough, HBO actually had the rights for the series back in 2010; they gave up the show due to the complexity of the plot and budget fears. The next year they went on to successfully adapt Game of Thrones which set a new bar for production cost the fact that HBO was too scared to adapt Dark Tower, but was willing to try Game of Thrones says legions about how difficult of a series this is to tackle.A decade in the making, Dark Tower has finally arrived and it's a disappointing mess on par with last year's adaptation of the classic series, Berserk. (Maybe not that bad, but it's pretty darn close) The film carries the title, ""The Dark Tower,"" and it features characters that are named Roland, Jake and the elusive Man in Black, but nearly everything else about the series has been brutally slaughtered, altered or just forgotten. Sai King might have told Nikolaj Arcel that he has remembered the face of his father, but with a score of 34 on metacritic and a disastrous 16% on Rotten Tomatoes, it's clear that Nikolaj Arcel and Sony Pictures are agents of the Crimson King.From the very beginning of the film, things are a complete mess. In terms of editing, writing and overall direction, very little makes sense. The film never bothers to explain where places are, or why things are happening, or who certain characters are. Unless you have read the books, then I imagine you will be pretty lost on what is going on. If you have read the books, which you really should, then you'll be shaking your head and laughing in disbelief as you watch beloved story lines get thrashed into oblivion.The film doesn't focus on the protagonist in the books, Roland. Instead it focuses on his spiritual son, Jake; and don't get me wrong, I absolutely adore Jake. He's one of my favorite literary characters. But when you're adapting a very established universe, it's probably not a smart decision to change who the protagonist is. Jake is a great character, but he can't carry the story in the same way that Roland can. There's very little focus on the entire plot. There were strong rumors of a troubled development and numerous reshoots, and unfortunately that is extremely apparent in this film. Scenes drag out for far too long or too little, and the film fails to elaborate on necessary plot points, and instead dwells on the unnecessary which unfortunately, falls into the realm of the cliché. (Of course Jake is bullied)The dialogue is laughably bad and some of the side characters, which are not in the books, have some horrendous acting chops. Jake's friend and Arra are negative standouts. I have a problem with them introducing new one dimensional characters over classic ones from the books. I don't know what the logic was behind that, but I disapprove.Contrary to the bad acting of the ensemble, the two leads do a superb job with what they are given. Elba shines as Roland. It's unfortunate that he's written so poorly and stuck in this film instead of a better adaptation. He carries the gravitas of a gunslinger, and it's incredibly sad that he's forced to perform in some terrible scenes. One scene with his father was cringe worthy. McConaughey was my ideal choice for the Man in Black. And despite some horrendous dialogue (""Have a nice apocalypse!""), he manages to be excellent. It's such a shame that two stellar castings are overshadowed by complete nonsense the studio inflicted.The film was made with a modest budget of sixty million. This is exceptionally small for a fantasy film, which means the director and writers had to make the best of every scene but instead they put in at least three chase scenes and random CGI monsters that no doubt took up millions of the budget. Those unnecessary scenes could have been used to expanded the story instead.The Dark Tower is a disappointing mess that barely resembles the excellent source material. I strongly recommend the novels to you if you have not read them. I'm hoping this film flunks, and that we'll get a better adaption in a couple years. Until then, we can only wait.",The Dark Tower

419,The-Lobstrocity,Dark Tower Movie Review/Book Tie In,2,3 August 2017,"The story resonates with me in the concept that there may be something greater than us all, a universal crux of purpose and meaning, something worth living for, and giving one's life to save. Whether your tower is literal or figurative (as I believe we all, like Roland, have our own personal towers) I hope this review helps those who have read and appreciate the novels understand how it feels to see your story unceremoniously go to die on the Big Screen.Admitting prior to this review that I am an avid and, almost spiritually, devoted fan to The Dark Tower series seems necessary. There may be spoilers in my protracted, lengthy, and rabid diatribe against what I perceived to be a raging dumpster fire of an adaptation. Whether or not the screenwriter/director truly wanted this film to be some continuation of, or relative, yet piecemeal and misguidedly referential adaptation of King's source material is tantamount to my perception of this film. The films director, Nikolaj Arcel, mentioned in some pre- release correspondence that this was a continuation of the story, the final go around the ever- turning wheel of ka, but after watching, it seems that this statement was his preemptive recusal of and distancing from owning the responsibility of not doing justice to King's magnum opus. That, to me, may be the biggest betrayal; that Hollywood yet again cherry-picked for the sake of fan service in a misguided attempt to appease those whom Mr. King so lovingly refers to as ""The Constant Reader"". This is an affront to me especially, as I've read each book at least 5 times front to back, page for page. That isn't to say that my singular disappointment is somehow inherently special, more important, righteous, or grandiose than every other devoted fan. I'm lost on the sheer lack of vision and the reduction in scope of the movie in comparison to it's source material. The clarity and veracity of the books themselves are not overly cerebral or lofty for the average reader to grasp. The simplest form of story telling, good versus evil, the fate of truth, beauty, love, and humanity itself is the core and the fabric of King's epic, and doesn't require overly convoluted and contrived plot devices to drive the content. Neither should a movie adaptation of said source material. The director chose to center on Jake Chambers, and through the amalgamation of specific yet somehow vague references to seemingly all of the Dark Tower series, and several other King works, Jake is led to a world that should seem familiar to those who know the story. Simply put, it doesn't work. Roland is Roland, but you get the sense Elba was trying so hard to embrace the gunslinger dogma that somehow the real Roland and his true characterization were lost in a few cheap, one- note laughs and awkward and cringey comedic irony.Levity in a story like this can be found in the ka-tet of the books as it grows like a family does, but the movie rushes and skims the true relationship between Jake and Roland. Roland once let Jake die, and would again if it meant getting to the tower. That isn't the Roland we see in the movie. The spirit of the titular hero is compressed and flattened and seems like a forced and rushed conveyor to a one-off happy ending all packaged into a tidy 98 minutes. I'm not going to give a total synopsis or deconstruction, but I have to mention the writer/director's choice of using the ""shine"" or ""shining"" element, based on the eponymous book, in place of The Touch, which several members in the world of the Dark Tower novel possess. It's a form of precognition and telepathy, per say, but it's used as a focal point for Jake's power in the movie. Shine? Really? If you're trying that hard to draw connections in a Stephen King universe already rife with interlaced and overlapping story lines, that you juxtapose one literary element from a arguably much more successful and faithfully adapted book to movie (The Shining, ignoring Kubrik's negligible story changes) then you've failed. I laughed out loud in the theater when the Man In Black first brought it into use. It wasn't supposed to be funny.For the average audience member, the action might have seemed fun yet at least somewhat hackneyed and a bit cliché, but for someone who has no previous knowledge of the story, this movie is a cigarette burn on a negative of a film copy on the cutting room floor of a poorly lit editing room filled with confused screenwriters, producers, and consultants all grasping at straws. This happened likely due to a false start by Arcel, who was nearly replaced as director but after supposed re-shoots expounding on plot (of which I couldn't pinpoint) apparently had a final edit coherent enough to throw into the August theater climate. The plot should have been as small and simple yet as profound as the landmark intro to The Gunslinger. ""The man in black fled across the desert, and the gunslinger followed."" There's your premise, now walk, don't run with it, and give us a movie everyone can enjoy. Don't package over 5,000 words of material into an unintelligible mess that will likely never see a true resolution fulfillment just because Hollywood thinks the average movie goer needs their hand held.I'm embittered, jaded, and cynical in terms of the movie, but that doesn't change my opinion of the books in any way. The Dark Tower novels will remain a stalwart of great storytelling as long as books are around, and hopefully gain more attention in spite of this loathsome movie.",The Dark Tower

I haven't read the book, as I said, but I could tell they script writers tried to get everything in, or at least more than could fit in that amount of time because by the time the movie was over I was left with a 'so whose story was this again?' feeling. we get Jake, who the camera focuses on, but is ultimately nothing more than the McGuffin, Roland, who is treated as a side character, but he's the one with something to overcome, and Walter because... because the movie needed a bad guy? to be honest, I don't get why Walter's there at all. let alone what he got as much screen time as he did. I think the movie would have benefited from giving Roland that screen time so we could see more of his growth instead of going from. I'm down in the dumps, to I'm badass in half a dozen cut scene.This is a movie I up someone will pick up and make a TV series out of it, because what it left me with is the sense that if given more time, it could have been an amazing story",The Dark Tower
422,theartofemotion,Brilliant movie!,9,4 March 2020,My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and found ourselves very involved throughout its entirety. Idris Elba and Tom Taylor were brilliant actors. Would recommend watching this movie despite all of the negative reviews.

423,bollarg,A Mediocre movie with passing nods to a Stephen King story.,3,30 December 2017,"This isn't a bad movie. It's an interesting Sci-Fi action story with good actors and good effects and some reasonable storytelling. It's just not The Dark Tower. It's hard to explain exactly what is wrong with this film, so I'll use an analogy;Imagine if they combined all seven Harry Potter books into one but started at book 3, set the whole thing from the perspective of Ron. Left Hermionie and Hagrid out entirely (and the Hogwarts castle), replaced obvious ethnic characters like Cho Chang with, for example, a red-haired Scottish accented character but kept the same name, replaced all mention of wizards with robots, gave some standard characters, like the Dursleys, superpowers and ended the whole story using the end from say Harry Potter 1.It's not a terrible film. It's just not the dark tower. It's as much Stephen King as the Lawnmower Man was. There was a bit of an outcry when they chose Idris Elba for Roland and most people thought it was a complaint about his race. It wasn't. Stephen King wrote the part with Clint Eastwood's character in mind. It could have been played by anyone except that there are a couple of black characters who interact with him in the books and never fully trust him because he's white. The people complaining about the casting couldn't see how the movie would be able to set up that relationship. ... it's simple though, the movie doesn't use those characters at all. I'm glad that the movie didn't do well. Hopefully now we'll get a TV series that bases itself on the books and takes its time to reach the conclusion putting storytelling ahead of effects.",The Dark Tower

I do so for this movie as there are two points of view. First, if you have read the books then forget the movie as a 95 minute movie cannot begin to explain the eight books that make up the series.

If you've not read the books, like the rest of my family, it is still a bad movie. Family members didn't get it at all. There was zero character development. Not even sure what was going on half the time. My kid was asking me, why is that happening, you read the books?! I had zero to answer. Basically had no idea myself what was supposed to be the point.

The man in Black looked pretty bad ass bad guy and the gunslinger like a good guy.No Oscar material, but it was more then ""watchable"".But after an hour or so it rushes to the end and all the build up excitement was gone.

434,bosullivan2-719-143250,Roland's Journey is one of terrific heights and terrible lows,7,2 March 2020,"Terrific score. Terrific cast. Terrific visuals.Terrible script. Terrible runtime. Terrible editing.As a Huge King fan in general and of the Dark Tower books, I had high hopes for this movie.They got the casting spot on. All 3 leads are superb. Mcconaughey's motivation is unclear for non-DT-fans. And he's given some questionable exposition to ramble off. But his overall screen presence and charisma is perfect for a cinematic Walter Flag.Edris is sensational as Roland. His character development and relationship with Jake (Tom Taylor) is very strong. You really believe their bond by the end of the film. And this is down to Tom's excellent portrayal and emotional development as film goes on too.The locations are breathtaking. They really nailed the vastness of mid-world in the few scenes they spent there. I only wish there was more of them. The movie just seemed so rushed to get back to New York unfortunately.The score then is phenomenal. Blew me away. Its delicate build up to the finale is beautifully done. Shades of Hans Zimmer's Inception soundtrack.Hats off to the Director for what he got right. It's a humongous task to take on the Dark Tower novels to turn into a film. They had what seemed like a clever idea similar to the Star Trek reboot, by reinventing the franchise in a way that let them retell the old ST stories that people loved in new ways. The best of. However, that only works if you have a screen franchise already. The Dark Tower did not.So everything feels watered down. You get bits of some cool stories as a fan you recognise from the books, but they are only touched upon. The editing also has a rushed feel to it. By the time you're starting to enjoy a classic Roland gun scene, next thing it's over. And there's a quick cut to the next scene, with an obvious change in tone/ score, that needed to be addressed more delicately.You only wish that the Director (who was passionate - just look at the detail in Roland's gun play, guns and costume design, to see how much he respected and loved the character) would have decided to make a Western Style movie based on 1st Book instead, that could have been a standalone while also leading to future sequels if successful.Unfortunately it's clear now in 2020 that this universe is dead and buried. Edris and Mcconaughey will not be returning to their roles. Which is a shame because they were all brilliant in the movie.Thankfully, if you put all of the bigger Dark Tower expectations aside, and just treat this as a standalone Good vs Evil movie between 3 terrific actors, there's still a lot of fun to be had and enjoyed during those few moments of brilliance when Roland gets a chance to rememeber the face of his father.",The Dark Tower

It was nothing like the books - it felt rushed, poorly written, and completely underdeveloped. Everything the readers came to care about in the books, from the intriguing history of Roland's world to the complexity of the characters, was altogether ignored for the film. Other than the character's names, Stephen King seems to have contributed nothing. Those who created this film should be ashamed. After watching the Dark Tower, I realized I had just seen nothing more than a weak imitation of Schwarzenegger's Last Action Hero.",The Dark Tower
437,thenecroposter,A New Chapter That Is Surprisingly Engaging,8,12 August 2017,"This movie got a lot of unwarranted criticism, in my opinion. There are, as I see it, two problems here: one, critics keep comparing the film to the books; two, the Dark Tower suffers under the weight of its own myth.Movies are not the same medium as books. What works in a novel often times cannot be translated into a film. That's just something people need to understand. Therefore, going into this thing expecting a facsimile of the Gunslinger makes no sense. Not only do many people find that novel tedious (I don't, but it's a matter of taste), but it does a lot of jumping around in time that wouldn't work so much on screen. I knew the film wasn't an adaptation of any of the novels, but a next chapter. But does the film work if you don't know that? I think it does. This is a film that does a subtle and non-obtrusive bit of world-building that gives a few sweet glimpses of Mid-World and the Prim waiting beyond. The plot isn't the most creative, but that's not a problem. If you were to read the summary 'group of people must set out on quest to stop the world as we know it from ending', you'd get Star Wars, The Lord of The Rings, a bunch of Star Trek movies and episodes etc etc. The main plot doesn't need to be the most creative thing ever to work. It's how it's presented that matters.So what does the Dark Tower film do with this plot? Pack it in enough fascinating stuff to make it its own thing. The characters are good, the acting is spot on, Roland and Jake have great chemistry (and Roland kills it in his shooting scenes; pun accidental yet unavoidable), Walter is charmingly and gleefully awful (the fact that he has some awareness of the cyclical nature of events is another little detail I found most charming).True to the universe King has created, this is just another shift in reality that presents basically the same cycle, only re-shuffled (readers of The Drawing of the Three will know what that reference means). We leave Roland's point of view and get Jake's. We see parts of Mid-World we didn't get to enjoy in the novels. The same urgency is there, only re-shuffled. It feels as if the whole thing's been re-shuffled so often, even time is moving on (not just the world). There's a strong feeling of this-has-happened-before (like I already mentioned, Walter even references it), and it's not because the movie is rushed, but because that's the point. They already danced the commala, so to speak, and part of them knows it. At least to me, that was what it felt like.Then, there is the whole myth problem. The Dark Tower novels are King's magnum opus and pretty popular. They happen to be my favourite books of all time. I've read the series through several times; I own the graphic novels. I truly love those novels. But in this case, the reverence many people have for them works against the film, because after going through the experience that is the series, you have the whole weight of the emotions that reading it caused in your mind. A new, introductory chapter that begins a new cycle will not and cannot meet those expectations. People often forget that the gunslinger is introduced in a short book where he - for the most part - walks through a desert, kills a bunch of stupid villagers, and has flashbacks. The amazement the book series leaves a reader with builds up mostly in the following volumes. That's not to say the Gunslinger isn't great; it's great, but it's an introduction that's a gateway to the wonders that lie on the Path of the Beam, on the road to the Tower. The movie, to me, is the same. It introduces. It engages. It opens a gateway - a portal, if you will.In conclusion: this film looks cool, has great acting, fun action, and allows interesting glimpses into King's amazing mythology. It could've been a little longer. That's the one thing I would've liked: more.",The Dark Tower

It moves along at a clip that keeps audiences' eyes glued to the screen, enthralled in the action and in anticipation: What's next!? Idris Elba is terrific. His character could easily be unbelievable, instead it is engaging and credible, he plays it not as an old west character, but as a man who has been beaten down but retains his honor and his intent. With the younger cast member (Tom Taylor, I think is his name) Idris develops a camaraderie and companionship that continues to develop and deepen throughout the film. It is convincing and essential to the story/plot. For me, the pacing of the film. The lack of any dead spots. The continual forward movement of the plot and action were the things that I found most enjoyable. I didn't attend Dark Tower expecting ""cinema"". I went expecting a good movie. I got it and more.

He doesn't need scars, horns or any other symbols of evil on him for you to recognize and constantly feel how efficiently dangerous he is.
He won't ask for permission to do harm or wait for spotlight. He will just do it whenever he feels like it.In order to save the world from such well portrayed menace, the forces of good need to muster some serious strength and courage. Fortunately for them, and for the sake of good fight, they are blessed with some skills of their own. Those skills are used in balanced and logical fashion so the movie feels natural.In this movie there are no unnecessary shots. No stupid one-liners. No ridiculous fancy super heroes tactics.

The Dark Tower went one step further and actively turned the character of Roland into a joke. I loved the idea of Idris Elba as Roland, he's a great actor and it allowed for a new exploration of the character, instead, it was wooden acting and dour facial expressions.They took an epic story told over decades in our world and years in King's and boiled it down to a bare bones generic action movie with little action and less character development.

460,bjvom,Disappointing but worth watching,6,6 November 2017,"I recently heard this is supposed to have been conceptualized as a sort of sequel to the books, so if you were expecting a film version of the magnificent but inappropriately termed ""Dark Tower trilogy"" of Stephen King's story you will be extremely disappointed. The movie is, at best, loosely related to the narrative of the novels which are even more loosely based on the Browning poem Childe Rolande to the Dark Tower Came, but if you just want an hour and a half of fast moving story, you might find it appealing. Idris Elba portrays a believable gunslinger. Matthew McConaughey is certainly malodorous enough as Walter. Jake is convincingly played by Tom Taylor. There is plenty of fast moving ""hold on to your seats"" action, but the story does not track. There is no motivation for most of the action because we do not have the back story. I sympathize with the constraints put on film makers as far as time, budget and availability of talent, but the film would have benefited from the characters left out of the movie like Eddie (the junkie) and Susannah (the legless schizophrenic) and Oy (the intelligent raccoon- like animal that befriends Jake.)

I only read a portion of the first book, which sadly I didn't have the opportunity to finish. Still, coming to this movie, my expectations were high.I loved the idea of a gunslinger. Loved the wasteland portrayed in the first few chapters of the book, the enigma behind the dark tower, and the mystery surrounding the title of a ""man in black"". Truly I had little to no clue about what is the Dark Tower about, but seeing the movie, the scenery, the faces ... It was what I was imagining while reading the little of the book that I have read.Some who have read the whole series might and have the right to say that the movie is not true to the source material. Does that make this movie bad? If I, who read only a portion of the book, can see this movie as being recognizable in it's core for a movie that has drawn it's inspiration from The Dark Tower, why can't others?Maybe it's just me, you know, I watched through The Hunger Games and The Martian, and not once did I go ""Oh, man, this isn't like the books"". I like when there is action in the books, and I like when there is action in the movies. Many would like it if movies could be just 2.5 hours of text scrolling down. Better yet; go to a movie screening and pass around books on which the movie was based on.Really? I'm really becoming tired of all these people. Movies are not just for the ""intellectually superior"" anymore. Everyone is watching movies. You can't be ""the best"" at it.

When Stephen King wrote the books is visible how it grows along the many years he took to write it. The characters are all important and very well described. The universe is amazing and I was waiting an adaptation that reached the fantastic universe that King create.But the movie gave to us only a mix of elements from books 1 and 5. The history is superficial and don't convince. They change so much Roland that I don't recognized him there in the screen. Besides I like the choose of Idris for the paper he was not good there.The movie is to much fast different from the books and I can't believe they made this movie to short.What save the movie from a complete disaster was the young Tom Taylor and the expert Matthew McConaughey. As a King fan I hope they don't make a sequel for this until they bring us an adaptation fantastic as the books.Pros: Matthew McConaughey great in the skin of Walter Padick. Cons: mix of book elements without a good movie history.",The Dark Tower
464,Purdinator,This Tower Crumbles,2,23 January 2018,"""The Dark Tower"" felt like a project that might never happen. A rich, detailed universe brought to life by Stephen King and tied in elegantly with a number of his other works, it was surely a tall order for the handful of directors that considered the topic (including J.J. Abrams). But its time finally came, with two heavyweights in Idris Elba and Matthew McConaughey in front of the camera and promising director Nikolaj Arcel behind it.In spite of the talent involved, perhaps it shouldn't have happened. ""The Dark Tower"" never feels fully formed and never hits as hard as it should. Characters don't get fleshed out and the bare bones plot feels most like a checklist and rarely manages to scare or thrill, alternating between turgid exposition and nondescript action.The disappointment isn't purely consigned to writing and production; Elba and McConaughey are letdowns as well. Elba, as a mythic gunslinger protecting the titular tower, takes the stoic hero archetype to an unflattering extreme. He displays little in the way of personality and generally mutters his lines, apart from an oft-repeated mantra that quickly becomes grating. Tragedy is the character's constant companion, yet that functions as merely a plot device and doesn't impart any relatability. Elba certainly looks the part and acquits himself well when the action turns up, but is given few chances to make an impression by the bland production.McConaughey fares only marginally better. As Elba's sorcerer enemy, the Man in Black, he seems poised to have a ball and create a memorable villain. However, there's a general detachment for the character that leaves him massively flawed. McConaughey spends an outsized amount of time at his base, calling in directions and stewing over plot developments with his rat-like minions. This from a man with the ability to verbally control (and kill) almost everyone he comes across, powers that are delivered with a level of boredom that indicates McConaughey wishes he had something more interesting to do. One wonders why he doesn't just roll up his sleeves and really get down to business bringing about the apocalypse he so richly desires. Why exactly he desires that isn't particularly well explained. It's just what an evil sorcerer would do.The third lead is youngster Tom Taylor, playing a normal kid from our world plagued by visions of the two adversaries and destined to play a major role in their battle. Taylor is likable enough, though is similarly given little room to define his character and go beyond wrestling with the disbelief of those around him. He does bring out the closest thing to tenderness in Elba as they form a careful partnership, but isn't given much of a chance to look anything but confounded.Confounded is what you'll be if you try to parse the mechanics of the universe introduced here. How exactly McConaughey's operation works, how he came to control it (as well as establish a secret base in our world), and how Elba is able to resist McConaughey's evil machinations (when no one else can) are all barely discussed mysteries. There's so much material that's nothing more than hinted at. The same goes for any deep development of characters beyond how they manage to serve the plot. It's easy to conclude that King's work would be much better served with a miniseries or even a ""Game of Thrones""-style extended series.In the end, there's nothing that stands out as memorable. Crossing between universes is like walking through any door. Psychic connections are formed as easy as any small-talk conversation. Bad guys are blown away with the quickest dispatch. Quips are spoken and moved on from before a laugh can even be had. The film simply won't allow itself to make a lasting impression.",The Dark Tower

466,domgwyther,He who trusts Sony with his franchise has forgotten the face of his father,2,18 December 2017,"A film adaptation of Stephen King's epic seven book series The Dark Tower has been along time coming. After languishing in development hell for decades with directors, stars and studios coming and going, 2017 has finally seen the story of Roland of Gilead and his existential quest for the mysterious Dark Tower brought to life on the big screen.Except not reallyAlthough I haven't yet reached the conclusion of the story in its original medium, I know enough to know that this film is for the most part completely divorced from the source material.From the opening text its clear that the filmmakers have decided to simplify and streamline the (admittedly meandering) plot of the books into a more straightforward 'Macguffin' plot involving the use of children for evil purposes.From there we get a fairly generic 'save the world' story revolving around a young boy from modern day New York (Jake played by Tom Taylor) as he journeys to strange new worlds and meets 'The Gunslinger' Roland (Idris Elba) all the while pursued by the sinister agents of The Man in Black (Matthew McConaughey).Making Jake the protagonist of this first attempt to adapt The Dark Tower makes perfect sense. In a complex world of parallel universes, ancient cultures and high fantasy, having a character from 'our world' to ask the questions is a tried and tested genre trope (think Neo in The Matrix or any of the Doctor's companions in Doctor Who).Unfortunately, Jake's attempts to understand just what the hell is going on are met with vague answers, mountains of exposition and throwaway lines that deserve much more explanation than they are given (did he just say 'Excalibur'?).For some bizarre reason the filmmakers have decided to try and cram the full story of The Dark Tower, complete with a final confrontation between The Gunslinger and The Man in Black, into one 90 minute film. In a world in which EVERYTHING wants to be a multi-film franchise and The Fast and Furious series has no less than eight entries with a ninth on the way, this choice makes no sense on any level.The film itself doesn't make a lot of sense either, image if someone tried to edit the entire Harry Potter series into a 90 minute fan film on youtube and then put it out in cinemas - there you have The Dark Tower (2017).One of the most frustrating things about the whole debacle is the casting. Idris Elba is great as Roland, with an unspoken world-weariness coupled with a magnetic screen presence, he is an inspired choice for the part (and another reason I was excited to see the adaptation). Likewise McConaughey brings a detached menace to The Man in Black reminiscent of David Tennant's Killgrave from Jessica Jones, only this time he has the whole universe at his fingertips. Unfortunately both actors are held back by a thread-bare script with very little in the way of 'character' to work with and minimal screen time together.In terms of the plot the stakes couldn't be higher with the Man in Black seeking to bring about THE END OF THE UNIVERSE by destroying The Dark Tower of the title.This should feel like a big deal, but as the film barrels-on, motivations become less and less clear and the point of the whole thing gets lost in amongst conflicting lore and strange tonal choices. As a comparison, The Lord of Rings The Fellowship of the Ring did a great job of setting up the potential horror of the world under the rule of Sauron, making it very clear what our heroes were fighting for and setting up their motivations for the next 7 hours of screen time. The Dark Tower instead chooses to make Roland and Jake's quest to take down the Man in Black far more personal, so much so that by the end, the pair seem fairly apathetic about the whole 'end of the universe' thing.More than anything The Dark Tower is a massive wasted opportunity. As a book reader (sort of) it's hard to know what general audiences with no exposure to the series will make of this cinematic mess but judging from the poor box office it doesn't look like they thought much. What could have been a epic story spanning over a decade in film or TV has fallen at the first hurdle.While some Stephen King's fans are understandably angry at the failures of this adaptation I can't say I feel the same way. I think the negative buzz combined with the short run-time prepared me for the worst. I'm not angry, I'm just disappointed.",The Dark Tower

But the rest of the movie is OK. I didn't read the books but i got the story well. This is a classic Stephen King logic. I realized something in the movie: you know that Stephen King obsessed the 1408 number, also he has a movie named 1408. I assumed you know the 1408 numbers combination. I don't wanna make spoiler.

Both played their parts spectacularly. I loved how confident and likeable matthew was as the villain, but i also enjoyed how you still found yourself cheering for idris (not like dark knight where you almost wanted joker to win). Idris was amazing himself, he fit the part, he truly was a gunslinger.Tom taylor was a geeky, awkward kid, which fits the stephen king trends. He loves empowering the outcasts. And he didnt fail this movie either. Tom was great, i didnt find him cheesy or corny he actually acted the scenes very well right to the end.The special effects and story line were also really good, i was super interested to see how this would work out. I know its a sci-fi, but i didnt find too many holes in the story.My only beef with the movie is it was WAY too short. Thats probably why it was hard to find holes in the story because it all happened so quick. I wish it was longer with a deeper story line and more focus on the beginning and making you more attached to jack, as well as the gunslinger.Overall it was an easy watch and it was visually pleasing with good acting.

Yeah, I must say that from my point of view, the story line is not cliché and it has its own 'recipe' that stand out from one another. The idea is fresh and I like the way they blend fantasy and reality to make it as a new flavor in film history.

Balancing between the two the dynamics and never ending struggle between what makes the series, The Dark Tower. It has been mentioned time and again, the series makes it very clear there are many worlds. Why traditionalist can't grasp that fact is frankly puzzling.

479,Das-Virus2002,Ten years in production hell well deserved,4,11 August 2017,"First and foremost: I am a fan of most of King's works and I do have read the ""original"" seven books of the Dark Tower cycle, only leaving out ""The Wind through the Keyhole"" as I felt another flashback story was unnecessary. In English, so don't tell me I shouldn't compare the movie to mistake-prone translated novels. I went to see the movie yesterday (release in Germany) along with my wife, who has never read any of King's novels but saw quite a few movie adaptions; both good (Shining, Shawshank, IT, The Fog) and bad ones (Last Stand, Langoliers etc.). Obviously, as an avid reader, I was more disappointed in this movie than my wife, who, as a casual viewer, didn't notice the glaring differences between source material and movie. Nevertheless, we both left the cinema astonished as to how utterly bad this movie was in many different aspects. Let's leave out all the source vs. adaption parts and we're still left with this: - the movie unfolds at a very slow pace at first, focusing primarily on Jake Chambers, whose portrayal by Tom Taylor was one of the few bright things left in this piece of mess. - after the exposition and the rather lame chase between low men and Jake, he finds himself in Midworld, virtually at the hand of the gunslinger. I mean, the portal he stumbled from apparently was just a kilometer or so away from Roland's last camp and therefore Jake could easily catch up to him, because DUH, Roland is a slow walker. - Roland decides to kinda adopt the boy, because, oh well, the story line demands it. The two of them then fight a pretty lame monstrosity in a forest and stumble upon a town that just so happens to be the home of the best visionaries to read Jake's visions. - the town gets attacked, because the Man in Black apparently sees everything everywhere and every time, and sends forces to kill Roland. HE DIDN'T EVEN BOTHER GOING HIMSELF! - Roland and Jake can activate a portal to keystone earth with the help of the townsmen and find a hospital to treat Roland's oh-so-badly infected wounds. Unfortunately for us, one doesn't really see any demise in Roland's ability to kill people.By then, 70 of the mere 95 minutes run time are already up and we pretty much haven't seen much of anything yet at all.on keystone earth, the two seek the low men's shelter in order to use their portal to the MiB's hidden refuge. Jake gets abducted along the way but points Roland into the directions using his shining. - boom pew pew ensues with Roland killing everyone in the building including the Man in Black. Yes,seriously. - Roland destroys the MiB's refuge with a single gunshot and Jake and him take shelter in NYC of keystone earth. - at the end, Roland tells Jake he couldn't ""live here forever"" and instead asks him to join him in Midworld.Boom. There's your resolution to the whole story, with the climax taking about 10 or so minutes of all-out CGI crap fest shoot outs. That's not only rushed, but an insult to the educated viewer. The denouement of about 5-10 minutes feels like a complete blow to the stomach and even creates happily-ever-after feelings, which is completely out of place in any given corpus of King's work.At the very least, Matthew McConaughey deserves credit for actually trying to play his role to his own limits and succeeding in his portrayal of Walter O'Dim. But that's about the only real positive one can take from this movie.",The Dark Tower
480,talismanthirteen,Critics can't figure out what to make of this one,7,3 August 2017,"This film spent a decade in production hell and anyone who has read the series knows that to call it unfilmable is an understatement. It is a genre bending sci-fi western fantasy supernatural horror time travel tale that takes place in an interdimensional multi-verse that includes our own Keystone Earth with visits all over those other worlds. Even knowing where to start filming this could take 6 months to debate. This isn't a perfect movie and it is going to mystify a lot of people that need everything explained to them or a box to put it in. A lot of people will dismiss that as bad filmmaking. I thought they captured the essence of the story and laid down some good groundwork. It is a brisk 95 minutes but it felt over 2 hours, and it is a rare film where that is a compliment. I had LOW expectations. I've followed the making of this thing since the start and there have been some decisions that were... questionable. I walked away mildly impressed. And in this case that is probably high praise. I won't be recommending it to anyone that isn't familiar with the books. In short: I liked it, but I was willing to give it a chance.

The Hero was played perfectly, his sidekick was played as normal sidekicks are (afraid at first but in the end is the real Hero) and the bad guy was probably the best role Matthew Mcconaughey ever played that I've watched.

Nothing about the movie ever really seemed like it ended when it should've (The part where they're fighting at the village).All in all, it wasn't bad nor terrible, it was your normal action- adventure/scifi type movie.

The movie might not be perfect but is a solid offering and much better than some of the super hero and Star Wars movies being made today. Both lead actors deliver towering performances (pun intended) and Tom Taylor is aptly cast for this role. Many fans of the books were disappointed but if you haven't read the books this movie is well worth your time.

I would say this film is within the average of what is done nowadays.It doesn't really surprise the spectator in its visual, its suspense and scenario, and most of the characters are underdeveloped on screen, giving us the feeling it could have taken a little more time to make it better. Also, the end looked quite too easy in my opinion (as much of the scenario in fact). But the main characters are still charismatic and well interpreted. The visuals and photography are correct.

I was relieved that it wasn't actually bad. The casting and acting were great and the whole thing did really make me feel like I was watching the dark tower.
That said, the script didn't really have more than a passing resemblance to the books. The Jake character had no similarities to the original character besides age and name and the movie borrowed elements from the books without actually using the story elements that belonged with them.
I'm guessing that the idea was to release this as an experiment and build a series from this if if took off?
I might have believed more in a series if they had had the guts to kill off Jake at the end.I feel disappointed and okay about this movie at the same time, which is weird.",The Dark Tower

And saying yes it's a different universe then the ones in the books is the most lame excuse ever.
There is no excuse for the abysmal telling of this story,i understand that a 1 on 1 conversion from the books to movie is impossible and that's fine.
But to shameless reinvent the lore of the books too this crap is inexcusable.
If you have read the books and loved it then stay away,if you haven't stay away.
This will only confuse you if you did or didn't read the books,there was so many wrong with this telling that it's beyond any bad book to movie adaptation i have ever seen.
Eragon is a oscar worthy try compared to this one and Eragon was bad really really bad.
3 stars are only for some of the visuals and the decent performance of Idris Alba,but i still think changing Roland's race is a bad mistake but he did do a great job with the crap that he had to work with.
But because there is no Eddie,No Susannah and No Oy it's the only reason that the skin color of Roland didn't effect this movie,because they killed everything else great from the magnificent story that the Dark Tower is.
And no this isn't a racist comment before all the SJW's start screeching,but the skincolor of Roland mattered a lot in the books and people that know the books will know why and can't do anything but agree.If you wanna enjoy this story and you haven't read the books then go to a library and pick them up,because this 95 minutes film felt longer then the 8 books that you have to read.",The Dark Tower

In some ways, it explains some things better than the books, while leaving other things unclear that were explained in the books. Nevertheless, an open-minded viewer should enjoy the movie even without knowing the books. There are several dark scenes where you can't make much out. Why is this done so often? We can't see your art, and it rarely adds to suspense or thrills. This is not the books in movie form. It's either an alternate adventure or a subsequent one with one of the side characters from the books. It has a different feel from the books. It is less epic immersion into many worlds but rather a very quick excursion between two. That doesn't make it bad, but it's different. I cannot stand people who reject movies for being different from the books. If you're one of those, don't see this movie. It is a different story, with some universe details changed.Not a masterpiece, but also does not deserve the mediocre or horrible review it has been receiving. Solid entertainment.Although I do have an issue with the movie industry in general: too many, including this one, have extremely convenient flaws in the villain's scheme/weapons/etc. That takes away from the credibility, a little bit.",The Dark Tower
495,misties,Absolutely one of the laziest King adaptions I have ever experienced,1,10 August 2017,"My god.....I was down right BORED in the fist 25 minutes. I had heard all the critic slamming literally all over the place, everywhere you looked and listened; television, you tube, magazines and of course right here on IMDb. Stephen King is my number one favorite writer. I have read practically everything he has ever graced us with. If I wasn't able to read it then I would listen to the audiobook. I am fully aware that King's material is relatively notorious for being hit and miss transitions but the thing is this was a miss of truly groundbreaking proportions. It's a miss for both readers and non-readers. This movie has crossed over a line. A line that is almost impossible to put into words. I found myself thinking of the worst adaptions like Graveyard Shift, The Mangler, The Tommyknockers, Children Of The Corn, why, because it definitely belongs in that rock bottom category. The funny thing is if I HAD to I would rewatch any of the four that I just mentioned. I will NOT watch this again. The Dark Tower very thinly disguising itself as quality with grotesquely typical superhero CGI made me feel as though I was watching a damn video game. Even the most recent bad adaptions like the unnecessary remake of Carrie was better than this, Cell was better, at least Cell had a story, 1408 was better.I strictly made myself purchase a matinée ticket just to be safe...$8.00. It was the multitude of negativity that drew me to wanting to see for myself. I really wanted to say what other people were saying here about ignoring the critics because a lot of times critics do exaggerate, especially when the books are so widely cherished by so many people over so many years. In this case the critics are not only correct but the movie even has people being ridiculously sympathetic towards it. This film does not deserve ANY sympathy. To the book readers AND non-book readers, the movie is TRASH. Ignore the positive reviews on here. As far as The Dark Tower is concerned the critics are right, 100%. If you do decide to go see it then I strongly suggest to buy the cheapest theatre ticket you can and brace yourself.I honestly do not know if Stephen King backed this project to its maximum. You simply cannot believe everything you see or hear in interviews. Although if he did, then it is very easy to see him fleeing across the desert dressed in black.....his back to all of his fans.....whipping his arm around as sharply as he can giving all of them the bird.",The Dark Tower

498,sebastianjlizarraga,"The lack of run time in this movie results in little explanation for anything, no motivation for the characters, and the main character being a plot device.",1,14 August 2017,"This movie has so many fundamental problems that are so blatantly obvious that I cannot believe the director allowed. The fact that this movie is 95 minutes is the root of many of the problems. The first problem is that absolutely nothing is explained. Why does the tower protect the universe? Why does Walter want to destroy it? Why did the studio waste 60 million dollars on this? Why? The problem goes so far to the point where characters will just say something such as the character of Aurra saying that they can track Jake's shine with no explanation as to how they do or how she has the knowledge of this. Characters just know things in this movie. The second problem is that the characters have no motivation for their actions. This is largely due to the movie not giving enough time to give them a simple backstory preferring to spend that time doing cool action scenes that are completely meaningless because we don't care about the characters. For example, the character of Walter. He wants to destroy the tower...that's it, that's all we know about him. Not why he wants to, not what made him do so. It's ridiculous. Now Idris Elba's character Roland has a bit more motivation with the death of his father but we don't have any care for that character. The movie wants us to just feel sad for him because of his fathers death but we have no backstory and therefore no reason to give a care. The last problem is the character Jake. However he doesn't deserve the name character he's more a glorified plot device for Roland to bounce off of. He has no personality and ounce again no backstory. This just scratches the surface of the problems with this movie and I don't believe you should waste the time to see this 95 minute action sequence. The only reason to watch this movie is because it is pretty well shot and has good visual however that doesn't excuse the major problems.",The Dark Tower

500,cryfenril-38465,This isn't The Dark Tower. Period.,1,23 April 2018,"Yes, it has characters named after characters from the books. Yes, there is a Tower and a villain and a boy. And that's where ANY resemblance ends.I could rant and rave about the total lack of Eddie, Susannah, or Oy. I could complain about the total change of the dynamic between the last of the line of Eld and the boy who said ""Go, then. There are other worlds than these."" I could mention the skipping of ALL the books and picking up at the beginning of the end (which isn't an end at all). All of that and more. But I'd be wasting my breath. Instead, I'll ignore the source material - just like the screenwriters did, apparently - and say the action scenes were rushed, the acting was flatter than flat, and the amount of deus ex machina displayed in every possible scene was breathtakingly arrogant. Can't think of a good way to resolve a conflict? Easy-peasy, a gateway or two with strobe lights! I don't expect anyone to take seven books' worth of storyline and pack it into a single movie. But to completely ignore all source material and just cobble something unrelated together is unforgivable, especially with a story as fan-driven and notoriously complex as this one.King fans are never going to settle for a halfway attempt when it comes to his opus - and this didn't even try to get halfway. The vague hints (a talking racoon commercial instead of Oy? Really?) and nods (""thankee-sai"") aren't going to appease us, they're going to enrage us. And by the way, they're totally lost on anyone who isn't enraged. As criminal as it is to slap the DT label on this thing and then tell people that it's just another iteration of the story, it is equally criminal to put Idris in a role for which he is a total mismatch; equally criminal to put McConn in one where he's limited to slithery evil one-liners and big grins. Both of these men have SO much more potential than is shown here, and the lack of story kept them on painfully short leashes. Watching this was like lighting the fuse on an M-80 and tossing it in a garbage can... only to have it fizzle out. There's a wee bang, a puff of acrid smoke, and that's it.

I would have expected the man in black, RF, walter, whatever you will, to lose for sure, but to accept he lost and move on in defeat to the next game so to speak.

Important people like Cuthbert, Alain, Eddie, Suzanna... none of them were even hinted at.I wasn't taken to the world I expected.

Portals are now transport machines, left behind by the old ones it seems, rather than magical things controlled by demons. And yet the house is still a demon apparently - but just because it offered a good chance for fancy graphics. Without a Suz to meet up with a demon while the men get Jake through where does this story go? It certainly doesn't go to The Dixie Pig because Roland has already destroyed it. It doesn't go to The Dark Tower, because Roland and Jake have already been there too and saved it.It's like this was some weirdly condensed version of books 1, 2, 3, and 7.

Average acting by all the actors, not too bad not too good.But one thing I found wrong was in the last face off between Roland and Walter. Roland fires 2 bullets at last. The 1st fired bullet is directed straight towards Walter, and the 2nd fired bullet is directed towards a pillar which takes a deflection and yet it is able to catch the first fired bullet and deflect it too, doesn't makes sense.

However... This new adventure in my opinion is trying a bit too hard. The whole bullet time effects and action sequences are just silly and feel out of place here. The plot of the film feels as if it's moving too fast to actually care about what's at stake.
Which brings me back to this being a new adventure, ""The man in black fled across the desert, and the gunslinger followed.""
I honestly feel like just doing a more faithful adaptation of ""The Gunslinger"" would have been great. Having Jake die as he does in the novel would have given Roland depth and added weight to his quest. Not to mention having Mid World slowly reveal itself as it did in the books would have added mystery and a sense of exploration.

Shawshank is in my top 5, as it seems to be with most people. The books were around though. My dad read them. I following this movie in development as it was the last one I saw him reading and it seemed everyone had Lord of the Rings type hope for this. The fans were wildly disappointed it would seem (at least they have It). From what I gather, it's condensing 8 books into an hour and a half. But what a glorious hour and a half it was. I'm intrigued to read that The Good, the Bad and the Ugly were one of King's inspirations. Also in my top 5. This isn't going to be one of those reviews that summaries the movie completely into 3 paragraphs. I hate trailers that give away the entire movie and I hate reviews that do the same. Instead, I just want to congratulate the people who made this movie, as it was the most unexpected yet enjoyable movie I've seen this year. It's so rare in a Hollywood film for it to not be so derivative. Every genre seems to be mashed up into this tight little hour and half package. It's absolutely worth your time.

Elba was great as Roland (though not the Roland book lovers know) They picked a good kid for Jake too and while McConnahey could have been more animated, I still felt he captured the essence of The Man In Black.

No character development, no plot depth. Even for a viewer with no previous knowledge of the book series, the movie is just bad. Director, Nikolaj Arcel, did a horrific job with this film. Other than a few impressive cinematic imageries, this film seemed very low budget. More disappointing however, was King's approval of this disaster. As a life-long fan, I am offended by this remediation of an amazing book series. This is the final straw. With one single film, King has officially lost the support of an individual that grew up reading all of his novels. I was looking forward to the new It film, but at this point I may pass just in protest of King. Based on this personal insult to all King fans, I hope more of us begin to follow suit and protest Stephen making any more money on these pieces of garbage that are allowed to use the words, ""based on the Stephen King novel"".",The Dark Tower
523,coasterfrenzy,Try before you rate,9,20 August 2017,"First of all: If you read a review complaining about how they try to fit 7 or 8 books into one movie: Disregard it. The reviewer clearly has no clue what he/she is talking about.The movie is mainly about the first book and some parts of the second book.The movie follows more Jake as Antagonist, than Roland, but especially in the first half it was all very recognizable and they followed the books very well. Of course things got twisted and changed a little, but that's what you get when you turn a book into a movie, nothing special.In the second half it is as if they were a bit struggling about how to create a satisfying end to the movie. It detaches from the books and goes a bit it's own way. This leads to a plot that feels like everything is going a bit too fast and too easy. Sure there is a point of struggle and a big comeback like in every story, but it's all very short. In this sense: the movie could have been a bit longer. The second part also hints to a lot of mechanics that are clear in the book, but not clear enough in the movie. For somebody who didn't read the books it's all just ""cool"", but if you read the books it feels a bit hollow because you know there is a LOT more to it (but isn't that with all movie- adaptions?).In the end: The makers had to create an ending that would both allow for a second movie but be sufficient to conclude this one (without sequel) as well, which certainly wasn't easy but I think they did very well. I'm actually looking forward to a next movie where the Ka-Tet comes together.",The Dark Tower

Even as an adaptation, there was nothing good about it at all! The characters had no depth to them! Nothing is explained about them and it made me not like a single one of them, not to mention the major flaws in Roland's personality. I have read the books multiple times so I was looking to love Roland and his Tet! Instead I was left feeling so disappointed and hopeless for it's future. I can't even get into the details it was so depressing. Honestly, I say just do yourself a favor and maybe wait for DVD before watching. Even that might not be worth it... Fail!",The Dark Tower
527,stevencvgarcia,This movie deserves wayyyy more than people are giving it,9,4 August 2017,"First off, I love Dark Tower. I've read all the books (currently listening to them now as a re-read), read all the graphic novels, read almost all of the connecting books, and even played the boring game they made for it (Discordia). This movie was the best way to adapt an otherwise slow story. Not that ""slow"" is bad, but if the director was going to do a straight adaptation, everyone would be asleep halfway through. People are missing how subtle the adaptations are I think. Roland is poisoned in the second novel like he is in the movie, Jake is lured by a demon like he is in the movie, all the psychic kids are pulled straight from the last book, and the first book is about Roland, The Man in Black, and Jake. While I'm a bit confused as to why they gave Jake a friend who added nothing to the story (unless it's supposed to be Eddy!? Hmmmmm), and why they made him live in a rundown apartment instead of a rich house (I guess to make him more relatable), those are minor complaints compared to the rest of the movie. Idris Elba IS Roland. I don't care what people say about Roland not being black, Elba captures Roland as a character brilliantly. Matthew McConaughey is FANTASTIC as the man in black. Didn't have faith in him honestly, but I was pleasantly surprised. As for the spoiler part (and this is a big one if you've never read the books so STOP if you haven't read them), this is a sequel and it feels like a sequel ought to. Roland has the horn of Eld that he left behind in the series and now will bring to the Tower (hopefully in the next movies that DESERVE TO BE MADE) and The Man in Black mentions this is the ""last time around."" This added so much to the movie and I loved every second of it. This movie was made for those who read the series and honestly the opinions of those who haven't read the books mean nothing to me because they simply do not get what this movie means to those have read the books. If people are too stupid to hate this movie because they never read the books or just didn't pick up on how clever the adaptation really is, then they need to not bring the rating of this movie down for their lack of perception.",The Dark Tower
528,ethanyama,"Why call the movie ""the dark tower"" anyway?",4,10 October 2017,"When criticizing a movie based on a novel I believe that the use (or lack thereof) of the source material is also a huge factor. Why else would you base a film on a book/comics? just to capitalize on the fanbase? And so, the movie itself is pretty nice, a fantasy action flick to pass a boring couple hours, no more no less. the actions is solid and the plot reasonable considering its a fantasy. The Photography is also top notch.Now, regarding the use of the source material, as one who read the full seven book series of Steven king, i can officially say it's a mess. The writers took parts from way ahead in the books and mixed them with their own inventions, to a very large extent inventing the main plot with no connection to the books.The first book of the series is a more western style that focuses on the gunslinger and his past, is has great materials in the form of action and romance. the relationship Roland has with Jake is more profound, meaningful and tragic. What i'm saying is that the material is there for the taking.I see the need to make this more appealing to the wide audiences, but there is this fear or insecurity about films that are based on books. it's like the director of whoever are afraid to go minimal, and would prefer a noisy CGI action scene to a more emotional and quiet scene. it's like an incompetence to portray a deeper emotion, and in stead hiding behind a flashy fight.It's a shame, because the beauty of the gunslinger lies in his persistence, his quiet and patient demeanor mixed with iron clad will and amazing ability to survive where many had long fallen. The violence in his nature echoes much stronger coming from the calmness that surrounds him. The movie, to a large extent, misses this beautiful tone of the book and a world is denied of the real Roland, #nohomo",The Dark Tower
529,rmichaelfox,Underwhelming Movie,3,18 July 2019,"This movie deviates significantly from the source material, and I would say to the extent that it is a retelling or reimagining of the books. It is not a mere book-to-film adaptation. I mention this only to say that I am rating and reviewing it as a film and not the books; and, as a film, it is not strong. There is an antagonist who is trying to destroy the one thing holding demonic (chaotic?) forces outside of a multiverse: the dark tower. But why? What is the man in black's motivation? We are never told. Where did the demonic forces come from? Why would they want to destroy all universes? Is the material world(s) good and the spiritual beings outside the world bad? The movie never addresses these issues. There is a bad guy, he's really powerful, and he knows how to destroy everything. But why would he? Why is Roland immune to his mental powers? Why did Roland quit caring about protecting the tower? Is it believable that, as the movie suggests, he quit because it's bound to happen at some point? Let's get more specific: Why were the bad guys looking for Jake in NY when the man in black left a mental trap for him in Jake's apartment? Why not just wait for him there in the first place? Why didn't anyone notice a gun fight in a gun shop in NYC? Anyways, I'll stop, the plot holes and unanswered questions could be addressed all day. The bottom line is that the audience is never made to care about anyone but Jake because he is the only character even somewhat developed. Therefore character interactions are not meaningful. Losses are not significant. Events are not important. Now back to the source material. It's a shame that too much artistic license is taken. Presumably, someone deemed the source material good enough for a film (or films). If so, then why abandon the source material so drastically when it is what inspired the film in the first place. The result is an inferior story and a film that demands no investment by the viewer because everything that happens is so inconsequential. That is ironic when you think about it since the universe is at stake. 3/10",The Dark Tower

It was though they tried to squash 7 books into 90 odd minutes, but without any respect to the story. Just ghastly.The three principal actors were all good, and so it was very disappointing that their considerable skills were wasted in this utter hotch-potch of what was, as novels, a pretty decent piece of work. The producers should be ashamed of themselves for wasting such an opportunity, and at best, unless you are Peter Jackson, this would have been better served as a TV mini-series.

I understand people will have differing opinions of this film, but I cannot give it anything above a 2 out of 10.

541,Dynamiez,Oh my God...,2,10 October 2017,"In short, I wish I had not seen the movie. If you have never read the books before, not even heard of them, the film is a very nice action movie. In this case you can give him 5 to 6 stars. Since I have seen the film ONLY BECAUSE I am a big fan of the books I can, as in the title already written, just say ... OH MY GOD ... What did the screenwriter have in mind? Apart from the names of some characters (and not even all important) the Film has nothing, really NOTHING to do with the books. Just a few examples: Roland's main goal is to reach the top of the tower. Finding the tower does not seem to interest him at all in the film. For this purpose, he would even go over corpses and sacrifice in the first book, e.g. Jake. He would never come up with this idea in the film. What I noticed in the film, he mentions, for example, that in his world the animals could speak. This clearly means Oy (or the Billy-Bumbler in general). If you have not read the books you can start with his statement in the film absolutely nothing. Two of the main characters, Eddy and Susannah, were simply squeezed out of the script. The scarlet king, who is actually the chief villain, is mentioned in the film only once as a saying on the wall, but does not appear to exist otherwise in the film. Also many places from the book and ""persons"" like Blaine the Monorail, Discordia, Lud and similar ... misrepresentation. Dpn't exist in the movie. So, Films are often different that their Books i some way, but that a film has absolutely nothing to do with the underlying book except the title, that's new ... A real shame. I was looking forward to the film, I thought it could be more epic as Lord of the Rings or Matrix at its time. But it's a movie I'll hope to forget tomorrow. As a conclusion, I can only emphasize again: The makers of this film should really be ashamed. Or, and that would be the first step to recovery, they should perhaps read the book, because I can not believe that even a responsible person did. And when they've read it, they should be ashamed of this movie more.",The Dark Tower
542,davevanzundert,A tale set in the world of,8,26 August 2017,"This is my fist review on IMDb. I feel the need to write it because I love the books but well, I also like the film. Watch it, there really are spoilers in my review. I don't think these spoilers will ruin the film for you but just so you know. I think for fans of the books it would be a good thing to read it so you go into the film with the right mindset. But that choice is up to you off course.To begin, the film is not as dark as the books. The things that make the books so good are the difficult and dark themes. Addiction, racism, sex, murder, abuse and more. Also Roland, in the books, is a sick looking, blue eyed male which is a thing when he meets up with Detta in the books. (So Idris Alba for me doesn't even come close to the man I imagined Roland to be).Also, in the film they try to explain things that in the book stay a mystery (like doors opening up in thin air). And a lot of the psychology is lost. I think the makers did not dare to show all stuff as they are written. Shame, but I do understand that it would make a lot of people angry if they did.So all this is not found in the movie. But, it really is a good film. As I already dropped his name, Idris Alba played a very good gunslinger! This movie is loosely based on The Dark Tower novels, and if you look at it this way then it is really fun to watch. They still made a good dark tale and the world/worlds they created are really cool and, for me, spot on. Also the man in black is not the guy as how he is described in the book, but man, is he a bad guy!So when you go and see it,keep an open mind and don't expect to see a one on one adaptation of the books but more a tale set in the world of The Dark Tower, and I am sure you will enjoy it!",The Dark Tower

This may account for the significant differences, e.g. Jake's backstory, the fact that Walter has the complete set of Wizard glass, etc. So maybe try to accept the fact that you are not going to see the story from the books come to life in a literal way, and then you can actually enjoy the movie. And especially enjoy the things you do recognize from the story you read. Is it worth 10 stars, probably not. But it's certainly worth much more than most reviewers gave, that's why I gave it 10.PS.

There was so much potential to put King's magnum opus on film that the anticipation was overwhelming. Sadly though, this movie has completely failed to live up to expectations.Idris Elba shines as Roland, and whilst he didn't match the particular image of Roland I had in my minds eye from the books, he does a great job bringing him to life.Likewise, Matthew McConaughey does a passable job portraying The Man In Black.Sadly, the shining cast was let down by poor, rushed scriptwriting.The Dark Tower canon is incredibly large, spanning 7 substantial novels. King himself has been working on the series on and off over his 45-plus year career, and most of his biggest fans worship the series. Director/Screenwriter Nicolaj Arcel's attempt to fit so much lore and canon into a single movie was a valid attempt, however has failed to provide on many levels.Despite the above-grade acting, the script itself felt rushed, the story unrelentingly pushed and hurried along in order to fit into a single-movie-length mess.As a King 'Constant Reader', even I found parts of the storyline difficult to follow, I can only imagine trying to follow the rushed pace as someone with little to no canonical knowledge of the series.The storyline would have been much better served spread over several movies.

Especially in the case of Stephen King, given the amount of detail he puts in his novels.But COME ON.I'll start by saying this - I feel bad for people who actually enjoyed this, like my girlfriend, who having never read king, thought it was good. IT WASN'T EVEN THE FREAKING STORY! I told her this when she couldn't imagine why I was so upset: Imagine for a second that she couldn't wait to see The Notebook, based on the Nicholas Sparks novel. She loved it's message and fell in love with the characters and story. Except wait - instead of the two main characters involved in the plot as she knew them, it stars the Wayans brothers and Kevin Hart who are fighting over one common love interest, who, shockingly is played by The Rock and the director/writer decided to CGI in Pat Morita to teach the Rock karate and, I dunno, how to fly a dragon. Same idea.This movie sucked.I literally went into the theater with ZERO expectations, telling myself that it will at least capture SOME of the essence of the story of the FIRST book. DAMN, was I wrong.I have no idea what the idiot who directed this had in mind, whether he read the source material or not, but this jumbled pile of flaming dog crap was worse than I could have expected.Yes, I am a huge reader of Stephen King. Yes, I've seen many, if not all of his other works in film. Am I biased? Sure. But I have also managed to find some saving grace in nearly all of them. This movie throws little bits and pieces of many of the novels in there, and then, whatever they didn't like or want from the books, they simply manufactured.The Man in black - Walter - doesn't at ANY point flit around through portals killing people or messing with people's lives. Making dinner in Jake's house? It's like he has his own little teleportation system to come and go as he pleases.The scenes with the 'breakers' don't happen the way it does in the books - at all. Jake is not the ""key"" to bringing down the tower.And what the hell is with those redundant people in the village? Roland has no part in killing Walter. And holy freaking hell - what's with Walter suddenly morphing into a god forsaken Jedi?!

If you're going to do a movie adaptation of a book, that has a dedicated, loyal and massive fan base, then you don't start off by totally deconstructing the main character in such a fundamental way! Everyone who has read the books knows that Roland was a Clint Eastwood/ High Plains Drifter kinda guy, even King himself has stated that Eastwood was who he had in mind, physically, when he created the Roland character. Idris Elba should never have been cast as Roland! He may be a great actor, but he was not right for this role. Stephen King should never have agreed to this major change and should have kept to the Roland Deschain character as described in his books. There were so many other actors who would have suited the role far better. Even Matthew McConaughey, who was cast as Walter, the Man in Black, would have made a great Roland. Viggo Mortensen, another great choice. The producer, Akiva Goldsman, told anyone who dared to disagree with his decision to cast Mr. Elba as Roland, to go ""F"" themselves! Goldman wrote the script and cast the characters, so I guess he holds a major part in why this movie failed miserably on so many levels. I just pray that Goldman has no part to play in the adaptation of The Dark Tower series, if it ever makes it to TV.",The Dark Tower
557,caseyferranti,I Like IT!!,8,4 August 2017,I have read the series. To be honest its been a while since I Did. While the Majority of the Critics give it a thumbs down there is too much micro analyzing the books with Movies. You can Never... never take a book an turn it into a movie exactly. The magic on paper is special and will never be put into a movie. There is nothing wrong with it. I saw it. You are never going to get a complex series in a movie like you expect. It would take over 10 films to work out Kings Creation. I liked it regardless of some of you more critical(so called) experts. Just enjoy it and be entertained. Life is too short to micro everything.,The Dark Tower

559,talys-13799,Loved it!,10,6 August 2017,"I haven't read the books and went in with fairly low expectations because of the large number of negative reviews, especially by critics. I'm so glad that I ignored them.What can I say? I loved The Dark Tower! The concept is at least marginally original, and it's an entertaining movie with the right mix of humor, and action. I liked the protagonists and wanted the villain dead. Kid was cute, likable and funny, and Irdis Elba was fantastic.About the special effects; I'm not sure what people were expecting in the fight scenes. The dude has a pair of revolvers. There is only so much you can do with that. I thought the effects were fine, and not overdone.Fair warning: when I go to a movie, I just want to be entertained. I'm not looking for deeper meaning. I don't care if it's predictable, though I appreciate twists. I don't care if it's not original. I just want to walk out happier than when I walked in, and not to think too much about it.",The Dark Tower

And as for those who complain about the casting.... Get over it. Next to Eastwood who is too old, I cannot imagine a better actor in the role of Roland.

570,Dave-No8,Well I liked it,10,24 May 2018,"Watched this last night with three others, including one mad-keen Stephen fan, and we all thought it was a hoot. So I was rather surprised to check out the reviews this morning and see how poorly received it was by many viewers and critics.
I've read only one of the Dark Tower books and that was quite a few years ago, so I couldn't remember much of the story, just a general sense of the flavour of the thing, which meant any differences from the books didn't concern me much. Nor did they bother the King fan among us. So many blockbuster movies these days leave me going, ""What? Why is this happening? This is just stupid!"" But I never got that with The Dark Tower. This was a well-structured, well-written offering with some fine performances, and special effects that at times were cartoonish but suited the material. 
The story has a mythic quality, borrowing heavily from Lovecraft, and alluding to Tolkien's Silmarillion, with spider-like beings invading from beyond the edge of the universe (in one scene a tarantula is used to illustrate the nature of the threat our heroes face: though the baddies are in human form, they're not human). Which of course also connects the film to King's IT (look out for the mangled ""Pennywise"" sign in the ruined amusement park!). And young Jake has a ""shine"" which again clearly puts him in King's universe. But the main thematic influence is from westerns, the quintessential American mythos, as the word-weary gunslinger defends the townsfolk once again. None of which is to suggest that any of this should be taken too seriously; The Dark Tower is a fine piece of entertainment which if approached in the right frame of mind is a lot of fun. I hope it makes enough money to encourage a string of sequels, so we can see Roland and Jake ride again.",The Dark Tower
571,hamish_eastwood,Why? Just... why???,2,14 October 2017,"Having read Stephen King's 7 book masterpiece three times over, I can safely say that the 95 minute movie 'adaptation' (I use the term VERY loosely) falls beyond flat, into what I can only call ridiculous. Someone obviously thought they could make a quick buck and write a lazy half-arsed screenplay that completely ignored the heart and soul that the novels oozed in abundance.Not only are we cheated of the epic journey Roland must make to reach the Dark Tower, we're also robbed of some of the brilliant and colorful characters who are recruited to accompany him, as well as those who are met along the way, both good and evil. Roland's relationship with Jake is a shallow thing in the film, while in the novels it's fraught with guilt and betrayal, a thing you can see develop from uncertainty and mistrust into a fierce bond; over time, a father and son type of love forged through the many trials they face throughout their journey.There is very little of Roland's rich history shown, both as a boy and a young man, which a vast majority of one novel focuses on (certainly, no time to delve into that in 95 minutes!). Mid-World and its many inhabitants are severely lacking... its many dangerous creatures and places, as well as the constant eerie threat of the Crimson king and his minions.I guess the actors did what they could with the script they were given, but this really should've been more of a Lord of the Rings type of series, the screenplay written by someone like a Peter Jackson or a Guillermo Del Toro - someone with a head for Epic. As it is, the film simply has no soul.",The Dark Tower

This movie was extremely awful.don't go see this movie....EVER!!!!! worst Stephen King adaptation ever.So bad. Really the worst dialogue I have ever seen in a movie. Not that it matters but even the camera-work/focus was off. The people that made this must feel really bad. 1 star just because Idris Elba was good.",The Dark Tower
573,brent-boyer,Should've been an HBO Series.,5,8 August 2017,"First and foremost, I want to say that The Dark Tower was enjoyable as a movie. However, not as a book adaptation.I read all the Dark Tower books (except for the 8th) and loved them. So much in fact, I read through it for a second time. I have been waiting for this series to be adapted onto the big screen for years. It was talked about, then pulled. Talked about again, then pulled again. Now, talked about and finally executed, but not properly.To leave out any spoilers, we have the protagonist Roland Deschain; The last gunslinger and his child sidekick Jake Chambers. And The antagonist Walter Padick; The man in black.To include spoilers; the man in black did not flee across the desert. And the gunslinger did not follow. There was no Eddie Dean, there was no Suzanna (which is understandable for the first movie, but still!), No giant lobster monsters (There was some sort of monsters, but they were no giant lobsters!), there was no drawing of the 3, no Blain the Train. No Just Jake being mistaken for a crazy boy with dreams which he seems to get entrapped into and meets the gunslinger. Then there is a standoff between the gunslinger and the man in black at the end. Which also, was not that impressive. NOTHING that I wanted to see from the books was adapted into the movie.Since watching the first trailer, I have been a little stressed as to what this movie would bring. On one hand, I am so, so happy to finally see Roland and Jake on the big screen.. Walter as well I guess lol. But on the other, I am disappointed it was delivered the way that it was. I do feel that this series could have been adapted properly if it had been gone about differently. Personally, I think this would have been excellent if it had been adapted by HBO. But, this is what we were given.So, all in all. If you did not read the books, you will thoroughly enjoy this movie. It is funny at times, sad at times, scary, and action packed at times. It is a fun ride. However, if you HAVE read the books. Well, go into it not thinking it is the Dark Tower you remember from the books and just enjoy it for what it is. It is still enjoyable at the least. And for that reason, I will be fair and give The Dark Tower a 5/10.",The Dark Tower

It is also a very efficiently written movie. Every scene, and every second has something important going on, there is indeed no filler going on.Overall very solid performance from the cast. Matthew McConaughey is a perfect Man in Black, and Idris Elba is as good for Roland Deschain as he looks in the trailer (Mc Conaughey is better than the trailer!). Tom Taylor is a really great incarnation of Jake Chambers, a 100% authentic Steven King character. The other actors make the best they can with the time they're given on screen. Even the supporting actors give great, realistic, powerful, convincing performance.The Lore is 100% true to the books, there are no insertions and no kind of political stupidity, merely some artistic license here and there.So if you loved the books, or even if you didn't, absolutely go watch this film, it will be a lot of fun and definitely worth your time.",The Dark Tower

There is a reason that SK's novels don't adapt to film well and that is basically because they are dull, average and (To quote family guy) he must be the least imaginative writer of this generation. He waffles and builds characters in the same fashion that most of us interact with each other. Hidden within writing is the ability to construct characters that you are likely to find in Maine, he does not go far afield. As you learn of these people a eerie presence builds up spotlighting at something dreadful. At the great reveal it all just does a Bobby Ewing dream sequence. A giant spider, a devil, Alien Craft, a possessed car, a demon dog, a disaster at the nuclear power station blah blah blah. The Bachmann books were cool for their time but this is not that. This is a movie based around the books, not the books. Sit back relax watch without prejudice and in all its not a bad film.

On its own, this would have been an OK film, maybe 6/10 and not a waste of time to watch. But seeing as how it was supposed to represent the story from the books, it pretty much fails. Given how short it is, the 3 main characters are the only ones you can relate to the books equivalents, and even then they come across as shallow representations of the fully fleshed out characters that appear in the books, not to mention the supporting cast that crop up through the series. Pretty much everyone else on screen may as well not have been there, especially Sayre (a waste of a good actors talents).Its not plain awful, but given the material its born from, it's like a wayward son that a family just about tolerates.

595,gt22350,Critics Got This Wrong,8,6 August 2017,"My wife and I went to see this movie last night. This is probably the only review I've done in the past 30 years and that's because I believe this was ""UNFAIRLY REVIEWED BY CRITICS"", so I'm hoping you'll give this movie a shot after reading what I have to say. I almost didn't go because the movie review in USA Today newspaper only gave it one star. Some of the user reviews here didn't seem very enthusiastic about the movie either. I'm 67, retired, and a King fan (I've red The Dark Tower books). My wife is 70, retired and not a King fan (she hasn't read any of the Dark Tower books). Just to provide some additional perspective some of the movies we've seen so far this year and how we rated (in chronological order) The Founder 5, A Dog's Purpose 5, John Wick Chapter 2 5, Logan 6, Kong; Skull Island 7, Beauty and the Beast 7, Power Rangers 5, The Fate of the Furious 8, Guardians of the Galaxy 2nd Vol 8, Pirates of the Caribbean 4, Wonder Woman 9, The Mummy 5, Spider Man 6, War for the Planet of the Apes 8, and The Dark Tower 8.I was worried standing in line to see the movie so when the previous show got out I started asking people (must have been close to 20) if the liked the show. (Would have asked more except my wife was feeling a little embarrassed.) Everyone said a hearty ""Yes"" except for one couple who shook their heads and said, ""It wasn't like the books"" and gave it a thumbs down. After that I was encouraged and looked forward to seeing the movie. I figured most of the critics were slamming it because it didn't follow the books closely. Frankly, from what I've seen, King books have always had a tough time being translated to the big screen. Although this movie didn't follow the books ""right on"" the main gist of the plot and characters were there so I wasn't disappointed. Contrary to what some other critical and user reviews have said, the plot was cohesive, well thought out, and had similarities to the book. The acting was very well done all around, the action was excellent and was not jittery or blurry. It's easy to connect to the characters and the emotional points of the plot.I started with a list of movies we've seen and how we rated so you can compare how similar, or not, your ratings were to put in perspective how likely you'd be to enjoy this movie. I wonder if critics and some users go to movies for reasons different from ours. We just want to see fun, entertaining, well acted movies that have been filmed and directed by good professionals. The ONLY ding we could give this movie was that it wasn't done in a manner similar to ""Lord of the Rings"" where it's carried out over 3 films with greater detail and depth. That might have been better, but maybe not. Regardless, I wish critics would at least rate movies like this with 2 stars as long as they're fun, well done and entertaining. There's no way this was a one-star film.Unless you really need the movie to follow all the outline and plot of the books, I'm extremely confident you'll enjoy this movie. It's well worth going to the show to see. You'll like it!",The Dark Tower

What a shame as I'm sure this story had so much more to tell its audience than it was allowed.
It feels like they had to pack the entire series of Lord of the Rings into one short movie and we all know for a fact that it can't be done without killing off the soul of the story and its universe.It was an avarage sci-fi adventure movie that should had been told in a triology of three 2 hour long movies.",The Dark Tower

Missed opportunity.,5,4 August 2017,"I have not read any of the novels, but I think I would be even more upset about the amateurism of this movie, and about the murdering of those (probably) awesome novels.First of all I would like to mention the aspects of the movie which were pretty good: -The scenery: The wastelands of Roland's world were beautiful. -The special effects/fight scenes: I was actually surprised how good the action scenes in this movie were. The special effect guys did a very good job. The fight scenes with Roland shooting bullets in slow-motion and Walter O'Dim's scenes were extremely fun to watch. -The actors: In my opinion the actors did a pretty good job. They did their best with the horrible script the writers handed to them.And now the negative aspects: -Awful writing: I have no idea how can four (!!!) writers create a stupid dialog and story like this. It's not even the book's fault, because as I know the story is completely different than the one of the books'. -The constant switching between the two worlds, the involvement of the ""asian medium lady"" and her village, the repetitive usage of the Warriors' praying were so unimportant that it makes me mad. Not to mention the ending...as if it was made for 6 years olds. -Sloppy directing: The director was nominated for BAFTA Award, so I am pretty sure he just did not give a damn about making the movie at least mediocre with the absence of a proper script. The cuts in this movie (when there's no fight) are very annoying, and I am pretty sure I could have cut it to be more watchable than Nikolaj Arcel did (and I have not directed anything yet).Summary: The books had a perfect material to create an excellent movie series, but someone decided to create an upset, a ruined cinematography from it. I am pretty sure it is the fault of the negligence of the people behind this movie (writers;director). If a Sergio Leone directed this movie with the given universe, it would have become a classic. Now it's a movie nobody will remember after a couple of months (if yes, then it would be due to their hatred for the production crew).",The Dark Tower

All of the elements that make the book series deep, magical, and moving were removed. I'm terrified to see IT now, and not because I think it's going to be scary. I'm not sure how to describe the fundamental failures without spoilers. Suffice to say, if you love the books and have any hopes that this movie captured the spirit of them then you will be deeply disappointed. To someone who has grown up reading and loving The Dark Tower series it is a betrayal. It almost felt like the writers were trying purposefully to change every detail they could.

611,NickBDK,"Bad plot, bad instruction, bad acting and a BAD idea",1,13 September 2017,"I love Stephen King.Stephen King have amazed me, thrilled me, scared me and made me yearn for more for years.Sadly this sub-mediocre film does none of that.You can watch this movie with or without having read the books. My best bet is that many, if not most people will at best be underwhelmed by this sloppy piece of junk, no matter if they have read the books or not.Judging from test audiences, Rotten Tomatoes and IMDb, then I am not the only one feeling that way.The plot lines have none of Kings vibrancy or suspense, if there at all. Its confusing and shoddy. The acting is shallow and unbelievable at best, and unwittingly hilarious or sad at worst.The film is a confused shambles and leaves everything to be desired.I can not feel or see the vision of the Director, if one ever existed.Some have with good cause drawn the analogy of the filming of the lord of the Rings.If so, then this movie is more on the line of the ""The Lord of the Rings"" by Ralph Bakshi, the strange rotoscoping/animated movie from 1978.Except that Bakshis movie at least had some originality, which The Dark Tower utterly lacks.Perhaps the fact that this movie was in Development hell for 10 years, should have told someone something.Having read the books, then the film goes from mediocre to a bad joke: The casting is way off and the whole setup is rather (poorly) inspired by the books, than an actual adaptation of the books.The pretence is that, presumably because the team failed utterly in actually making an adaptation of the books, that this is a ""continuation"" of them. Which it quite obviously is not, its just a bad rewrite, and an even poorer film.On a different but parallel not, then to me many of the positive reviews of this movie on IMDb, looks very similar indeed.

612,filmvigilante-04949,Soap Opera Drama Disguised as an Action Movie,4,7 August 2017,"First I will say that the action you see in the trailer is for the most part the only action in the movie. The entire movie is just the characters talking about their problems. They talk and talk and talk and nothing is ever shown. Also it's worth noting that it is very forgettable. I tried having a conversation about the movie afterwards and most of it was about how neither of us could remember what all happened. This was ten minutes after having watched it. It's so slow that I tended to get lost in my own thoughts thinking about random crap because I found it more interesting than paying attention.Matthew McConaughey does a perfectly good acting job, but should never be cast as a villain. He is too likable. There's a reason he plays the good guy in so many films. I respect him trying to do different roles, but he just evokes that good guy vibe. And this just isn't a villain role those characteristics work for. His face and voice are too friendly and there wasn't near enough effort to change either of those. He deepened his voice slightly, but that's it. Nothing wrong with his acting job, just hard to take him seriously as a bad guy.Lastly this movie falls victim to something a lot of movies do. The bad guy has way too much screen time. In this case when you cast someone like Matthew McConaughey who is a big shot actor it's hard not to do this, but it's a mistake none the less. When the bad guy is on screen practically as much as the main character things tend to lag. It disrupts pacing because it makes the chase way too drawn out and slow.Sorry for the monologue I'm a theatre kid.",The Dark Tower
613,beltran-32978,This should've been a show with 7 seasons,1,6 September 2017,"Talking about the story inconsistencies between the movie and the books is a heavy task. It's like someone summed up the books to Nikolaj Arcelin in an hour, he took a few notes and went from there without learning more. Here are few examples.I'm just guessing the amount of ""political correctness"" pressure which lead to choosing a black actor for the role of Roland Deschain. Before anyone starts snapping - yes, he is white. He is the last living descendant of king Artur Eld.And if you could change the color of the main character, then why not change Jake's age, character and background as well?! Seriously, to play Jake, Tom Taylor should've looked at least like his IMDb photo.The children in the books did not have psychic powers. The ""smart"" matter from their brains was being drained to feed the guys with psychic powers. They in turn were blissfully trying to destroy the beams, which are holding up the Dark Tower, and were not attacking the tower directly.I could go on and on but it's enough to just ask: where are Eddie and Susanah? Also, I was really looking forward to see who is playing the lovely girl at the window Susan Delgado.But let's say there wasn't enough time for one movie to cover it all. Let's say the upcoming series will make up for all the missed stories and beloved characters (I wonder if Stephen King is going to appear on the screen as himself). Let's rate the movie as a stand-alone peace of art. The story was not engaging. The action part was mediocre at best. The adventure was not ventured. I would not watch this movie twice. I would not have been aspired to read the novels by it. I'm not going to watch the series either.And one last thing for the movie sins lovers. Walter from the movie puts even Darth Vader's abilities to shame. (In the books his magic was not that strong and also he doesn't die by the gunslinger's hand. Oh, what a joy was for me to read how Mordred ate him alive!) He had no need for Jake's minor psychic power and could've destroyed the tower himself.Avoid if you've read the books.

615,mikemg-33748,"The Dark Tower, a review by someone who has read the entire series",9,10 October 2017,"There's little doubt that when it comes to Stephen Kings The Dark Tower stories, the Sony team, director Nikolaj Arcel, and the movies lead actors are hoping to start a franchise. The Dark Tower is but a taste of the world Stephen King has created, and leaves viewers wanting for the main course. This film in many ways reminds me of ""Jumper."" Original enough, outstanding premise, yet filmed with sequels in mind and without wanting to give too much away, left short on substance. Both films are barely 90 minutes, both crescendo and resolve rather quickly, and seem somewhat incomplete, nay brief, on purpose. The Sony team and Nikolaj Arcel are taking a gamble with The Dark Tower, we aren't fully immersed in this interesting new world, it's storytellers only go so far as to allow the audience to dip a toe into it's possibilities. Thus, leaving audiences to crave new and more broadly immersive experiences in the land of Roland Deschain and the Man In Black. Or so the theory seems to go. The losing end of that gamble, like with ""Jumpers"", you have a movie that does not perform well enough at the box office causing the suits sitting atop their production company towers to sour on the idea of funding future chapters. If you're going the route of Lord Of The Rings, pay for 3 movies up front and make them all in succession. Or if you're going to go the Star Wars way, make one complete movie that goes all the way on it's own, then add more films later. The Dark Tower does neither. All appetizer, but will there be enough money for dinner?That said The Dark Tower is a good flick, yet it really doesn't have much to do with the books - though any future sequel, if there is one, promises to hold more true to it's source material, Eddie and Susannah Dean and all - but without the backstory of having read the series to fall back on, the telling of it can be a bit confusing and come together a little too quickly. I know some people didn't like the casting of Idris Elba as the stories hero, Gunslinger Roland Deschain. I will admit I had a few reservations myself, but having just finished the movie, all I have to say is, ""wow!"" Elba truly puts forth a stunning performance and portrays the complicated character of the Gunslinger in superb fashion. It's not so much that I originally doubted Elba, I have just always envisioned Roland too well layered, too well thought- out, and ultimately too complex a character to translate to the big screen. At least in any meaningful way. In a challenge I believed would be too daunting for most actors, Elba embodies his character with a precision I did not think possible. Idris Elba, I'm impressed.Matthew McConaughey plays the cliché bad guy, and does so admirably. His part doesn't require the same level of skill as Elba's, yet he makes the part his own and brings a depth that many of today's cliché'd ""Bad guys"" lack. Tom Taylor plays his part expertly, and it was refreshing to see a young pre-teen/teen actor play a role honestly, without acting like a brat with a stereotypical need to rebel from anything-anyone. The rest of the cast is entirely forgettable minus Jake Champers mother, played by Katheryn Winnick whom takes a forgettable role and with the minutes of screen time she has manages to make a impression. This is a movie some will tear down only because it fails to meet their lofty expectations, to those people I say, support this movie, get your friends to go see it, because The Dark Tower: The Drawing Of The Three is going to be the movie that you wanted. The first impression might not of turned out the best, but I believe Sony and director Nikolaj Arcel have produced a winner. And if you can get past ""hello,"" enjoy this movie for what is - a introduction - we'll all be rewarded with a franchise of films the likes of which has not been produced yet. The Dark Tower isn't the whole series in a movie, it's a thrilling and inspiring look into a world that, for most who see it, will be left enthralled and left wanting more. Don't be jaded by the fact it's not all you wanted, enjoy it for the very good movie it is, support it, and we'll all get what we want as we watch the sequels.",The Dark Tower

Ancient technology in the medium world is literally human contemporary technology, why?

This movie is really not so bad, though, if you didn't read it, or watch it as an independent thing.The actors all did a solid job, especially McConaughey in the role of the evil magician. The CGI feels natural enough and the cinematography looks just fine. I especially liked some of the locations, which featured some quite spectacular landscape. The story is very fast paced and there is quite some tension.
What I didn't like so much is that the story seemed a bit rushed at some points and could have used some more space here and there. They just didn't leave enough time to really feel with the protagonists because there were always happening a lot of things all the time. Probably they tried to squeeze too much base material into 1:30h of runtime.Altogether I really enjoyed the movie, though. It's not spectacularly good, but I was well entertained. I think if you read the books you will probably hate it and should stay away from it. Otherwise, give it a go. It's really not as bad as people make it seem, they are just biased.

If each book in the Lord of the Rings and the Harry Potter series deserved movies then every book in the Gunslinger series does too!There are so many more important characters and events that occur during Jake and Roland's journey to the Dark Tower that stretched the imagination and were both suspenseful and enjoyable to read about, I'm certain they would be so on the big screen.",The Dark Tower

Matthew McConaughey played one of his best roles ever and Idris Elba was super. The score, and particularly the Gunslinger Theme ... wonderful! Didn't need to be a faithful adaption as it was a sequel. It was always disappointing to me that Roland didn't kill Walter in the books, another time around, another opportunity.

He's got the horn. That's it. That's the whole key to this movie. At the end of the books, Roland laments that he didn't pick up his friends battle horn, one of the keys to the Tower. Once he climbs, time is reversed, sending him back to the beginning, but this time, he picked up the horn before his travels.That's why it's not identical to the books, it's a whole new story that he must take on.",The Dark Tower

However as it is labelled as the Dark Tower Movie and advertised to fans as being such I feel extremely let down. The only resemblance to the books is that a few character and place names is in it - THAT'S IT!Imagine if the made a Lord of the Rings movie that had 2 characters called Frodo and Sam, and it turned out to be a musical set in a ring of flowers. That's about as close as this movie gets to the original work!WHY OH WHY did they not take this the same route as Game of Thrones and make it into an epic TV show? It doesn't need to run for 7 seasons, one season with an hour long episode dedicated to each book would have been a million times better than this! Why did Mr King sign off on this? Surely he doesn't need the money...As this movie is falsely advertised and bares no resemblance to the source material I can only in my heart of hearts rate it 1 star - would have been 0 had the option been there.",The Dark Tower

There was no horn, and Roland never actually made it to the tower. The movie ending was garbage made from some impatient screen writer who didn't even read all the books cover to cover.Next up, according to the book's, ROLAND NEVER kills The Man in Black, rather his son. So why wasn't Mordred in the movie?The books were amazing, detailed, and very breathtaking (if you have enough imagination to visualize what you read).
The characters barely had any personality, if any, and the story/plot was minimal at best, especially as a ""sequel"" (while missing TONS of information and content) to the 7-book series.This should've either been another thick novel, or minimally 3 movies.

I heard of the movie and wanted it to be good. However, with the hit and miss track record of Stephen King movie adaptations, I was coming from a low bar. And then..... they announced who was going to be Roland. While Idris Elba is a fine actor, by no stretch of the imagination is he ""Clint Eastwood from the Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" as described by Mr King. But hey, 8 books, they are talking about a trilogy, two TV seasons as well. And then.... I watched the movie. Sorry Mr King, despite your sign-off, despite McConaughey, despite Elba, this move stank. At best, this should have been billed as ""inspired by Dark Tower"" or perhaps ""shares the same name and characters of the Dark Tower series but all other comparisons ends there"".What they should have done is NOT made this piece of dross but instead handed it to Netflix or HBO and given it the Game Of Thrones treatment.

There's nothing novel in this and everything is so obvious from the beginning to the end. Everything, even the main character and his family is like every other mediocre cliché fantasy (a little boy without a dad looking for a father figure). Though, it is rather interesting how committed the story is to ""gender roles"", anyone who as much as raises a weapon must be male while women are reserved for the roles the author seems to find appropriate for women, that is mother, assistant, the girl screaming only to be saved and protected by a boy younger than her (even though she has basically lived all her life in a dangerous world without our technology and the body is a first-world school kid with zero survival training). But hey! If we have learned anything from hundreds of fantasy books, it is that the little white boys are all the ""chosen one""!The only plus about this movie is Idris Elba.

END SPOILER END SPOILERThis was meant to make the material approachable to those who haven't read the series while also allowing readers to enjoy the series without having their hopes dashed by there being some information or characters missing from the film. This was not an attempt to cram almost 5,000 pages of information into 90 minutes either, this was just the first part of a sprawling series that is set to continue in a mini-series before leading into the next film. As a devout lover of the series I was really impressed with the three leads and how they handled the material while also its various connections to the rest of the King universe. I wasn't expecting much action in this film as it is basically an alternate universe version of the first book, which itself only had two real action scenes itself, but what was there was a good recreation of how Roland fought within the books.

653,SashaDjurdjic,WOW ... when you think it CAN'T be THAT bad,1,11 October 2017,"Long ago, when this was announced I was as giddy as I was nervous. As so many Dark Tower (DT) fans, I eagerly awaited big-screen adaptation, but at same time King is hardly a writer that gets good movies based on his work ... and then when Idris was cast as Roland I decided in all seriousness to avoid this completely. Idris is a GREAT actor, but him as pale skinned blue eyed gunslinger? No ... and I mean NO! But my love for DT was too great. And King himself talked about ""continuation"" of DT universe, which, coupled with book ending, made me watch this. Let me tell you this - NEVER AGAIN!Spoilers ahead:Good things? Matthew McConaughey as Man in black. Perfect cast, as everyone expected him to be. Let's hope Stand gets reboot (better than this, please, for the love of your fathers) with him as RandallBad things? Oh, so many, it would take longer than movie itself to list them all, but let's write the most obvious ones:No horn of Eld (if this is continuation where the frack is it?) No Susannah (not surprising, kinda hard to tell Idris he is ""honky mofo"")No Eddie Dean (7 books crammed into 95 minutes, no Susannah, again - not surprised) Jake with shine bigger than Ted Brautigan, Sheemie Ruiz and Dinky Earnshaw combined? Major surprise ... not a good one at that Roland has forgotten the face of his father? He doesn't care about the tower, all he is after is revenge against Randall/Marlen/Walter? In all the worlds and all the universes it is the ONE thing you CANNOT do to DT universe! I could go on, but this should be enough to an even a casual DT reader to skip this entirely.In short: if I could I would give it 0/10. EVERY true DT fan will. I don't no need to explain why to them. And to all those who have no idea about DT, skip it anyway. You will not get ANY reference about DT universe (which makes a big part of the movie senseless), and will be left with mediocre action/fantasy flick at best. Those couple of minutes of gunfight aren't worth your time. People say ""there are other worlds than this"" for DT movie. I hope there aren't if this was the best they could make.",The Dark Tower

There are a lot of interviews with the cast and King that tell you this is a total retelling of Roland's next trip through the door not just a line by line script made of the books. I think it lays out very nicely a groundwork for what is yet to come. I would much rather see a new journey than the one I have read and listened to so many times before.

658,nandanishant,Very dissapointing conversion of such a great novel,5,4 May 2019,"This is my first review in years. I only give ratings to movies; however I had to review this. I am going to sum it up in brief - I am sure ""The director had no clue what he was doing"". The main character, which is Roland in the Stephen King novels, is like God; however in this movie, everything is moving so fast, we hardly get to know who Roland is, except for the fact that he is some dude who knows how to shot well.
There is no story build up, no thrill, not much about Roland, no much about the Dark man, not much about what the dark tower is and the depth in it's power.
There basically is nothing in the movie. Matthew who plays the man in the Dark is one of my favourite actors; however he does no justice to the role either.
All in all, anyone who is a Stephen King fan, and has read the entire series would probably feel that almost everything is missing from the novel. Anyone, who has not read the novel will not have a clue as to what is going on in the movie.",The Dark Tower

You get thrown into a story with no background really or character building, some of the main treads of the books are changed completely (for example how getting to the tower is the main desire for Roland, but in the movie he is only focused on getting revenge). My guess is that the director choice for this movie was completely wrong. This could have been such a great movie, it's sad to see it turned into some Hollywood cliché. I really do recommend reading the books, they are so worth it. Just don't judge the story on this movie.",The Dark Tower
661,allie-hanley,Why all the unnecessary hate from critics? I got your answer here.,6,4 August 2017,"If you never invested the many hours of reading it takes to tackle the eight book and massively wordy series from Stephen King that the film is based upon, then you probably would think the ""The Dark Tower"" isn't half bad despite the overwhelming hate the film is getting from critics. Critics are panning the film but is it because they know it took four writers, a massive effort with lots of setbacks to deliver the hour and thirty-five minute film? Is it because there is an expectation that the film should reflect everything that happened in all eight books? Is it because they expect the screen adaption to be more like a trilogy akin to ""The Lord of the Rings?"" Is it that they don't know ""The Dark Tower"" is actually a sequel to the books. Yes, it's a sequel. If you read the books then you may recall that the worlds are on a wheel, representing that life repeats. Roland defeated The Man in Black, but then Roland knew it was all going to happen again. This next time would be different and the film represents the next life of Roland. If you set all that you know about the long tale that the film is based upon and just watch ""The Dark Tower"" as is, the film stands on it's own two feet. It has a beginning, middle, and an ending that makes sense. It's paced evenly. Has an intriguing story, excellent villain in casting McConaughey, and it's a fantasy. So why the massive hate out there? There are two distinct ways to view the film. One is with a background in Stephen King (which I have), and one without. I chose to judge the film based on it's own merits rather than expecting it to somehow encompass the eight novels (that would perhaps have worked better as a TV series as first pitched long ago). It's the only fair way to judge a film. Complaining that the film took ten years, a zillion directors who came and went, etc. should have no bearing on the finished work. The truth is, some films take more effort than others. Sony thinks the effort was worth it and is counting on Stephen King fans to turn out and see the film. However, this is where the issue may lie, and unfairly so. If you are a film studio and you green light a movie counting on that built- in fan base, then you should try and stick to the source material but the plausibility of that happening is near to zero. That's not opinion. You can't take eight books and cram it into a film. A percentage of critics seem to think that justifies burying the film in negative reviews. ""The Dark Tower"" isn't ""The Lord of the Rings"" but to some it could have been, and therein lies the root behind the lousy reviews generally. Expectation is sometimes hard to curb especially in this case because of the source material. The solution lies in the marketing. The studio should have made a better effort in delivering  a message that stressed that ""The Dark Tower"" is a loosely based adaptation of King's work and most importantly that it's a sequel to the books. There were a lot of interviews out there beforehand that could have highlighted the nature of how King ended the books to curb expectations. Additionally, marketing could have better opened minds that the under- lining goal was to create a version that worked in less than 2 hours for the big screen and not have King fans expecting the next ""Lord of the Rings"" -esque cinematic experience. The expectation is not set appropriately and the critical scores fairly/unfairly reflect this.""The Dark Tower"" stands on it's own two feet when not held in context to its source material as the creators wanted. Yes, screenwriters chose to gloss over the deeper dynamics of the source material in lieu of a faster, perhaps less meaningful overall story. Despite that, the story is still balanced, characters motivations make sense, and it's evenly paced. The studio undoubtedly is counting on Stephen King fans to fill the seats this weekend and that's where the expectation may fall short because of critics panning the film. You can't expect built-in fan support for a project that doesn't deliver on the source material. Unfortunately, and fair or not, ""The Dark Tower"" doesn't deliver on King's opus work simply because his tale is too massive for the medium and should be done via episodic TV (if done at all).  Cinematically ""The Dark Tower"" equates to a nice diversion and probably won't stay in the minds of moviegoers as anything special. It rises to just above mediocrity.  If you either watch the film as a stand-alone, or with the idea that it's a sequel to the eight books it's based upon, you may get more out of it.

Acting was great from the 3 main characters still Mathew McConaughey stood out and shined brightest with his performance. Storyline was short and streamlined which doesn't help but was OK for a 1.5 hours movie, i just wished they could have at least a trilogy in order to expand it further.

It was much more sci-fi than fantasy.McConaughey was perfect as The Man in Black but they passed on much better actors than Idris Elba for Roland Deschain/The Gunslinger.

664,dandjdecker,"Don't waste your time and money, read the books instead.",1,5 August 2017,"To any and all the Dark Tower fans out there. The new adaptation of the Stephen King book series by director Nikolaj Arce is a travesty. Possibly the worst adaptation of any Stephen King novel yet. If you are a fan, this 90 minute rip off of the name ""Dark Tower"" does little justice to the story line in the books. It is hard to follow, has characters that are not in the books, the characters that are in the books don't work in the movie or aren't the ""same"" characters as in the book, and there are several characters, namely Susannah, Eddie, and Oy, that are missing completely! They jump from the Drawing of the Three, back to the Gunslinger, then out to Dark Tower, then back to Song of Susannah and then they throw in a little Cujo, It, and the Shining and call it a day. That was a waste of both money and time and I recommend that you don't bother if you want to keep the mystique of the books alive in your mind.For those that aren't fans of the novel, don't bother going to see this movie to get an idea of what the book series is like. First off, it doesn't represent the books well in the least. Second, if you don't already have a good grasp of what's going on, you won't be able to follow the story line because it's so convoluted. They thinned down so much detail that it's nearly impossible to get the gist of what's going on in the movie. It seems as if the director and the producers didn't give a crap about the story, and were afraid to spend any money on this very detailed and very complicated saga. They spent a mere 90 minutes trying to cover an epic that is of the same proportions as the Hobbit AND Lord of the Rings put together, or if you're a Star Wars fan, episodes 1 through 6. It's just not possible to put it all in one movie, which is what is seems they tried to do. Even if they have sequels to this film, and/or a TV series as I've heard through the grapevine that is in the works, they f'd it up by the way they told the story in this first movie! The actors themselves were fine, they did the best they could given the screenplay they had. I wonder though, have any of them actually read the story line?

And I love Idris, but Roland should be done by Clint Eastwood, as it comes out clearly from reading the book. The worst adaptation of book to film ever.

674,gtippitt,"Bad, simply bad",1,8 October 2017,"This movie has several characters with the same names as Stephen King's Gunslinger/Dark Tower series of novels, but I did not see any evidence that the film's writers and director had ever read the books or had more than a vague notion of the books' plots. The film is somewhat of a miracle. I loved the books, I love many of the actors, I had waited eagerly for this movie since rumors of the project first reached the Internet, yet I loathed this movie passionately. Spending 90 minutes puking violently with also having explosive diarrhea from food poisoning would not have been much worse than watching this movie. In the case of food poisoning, the experience might have left me feeling better than beforehand, which was not the case with this movie viewing. I would be hard pressed for a decision if forced to choose between watching this film again versus eating a three day dead armadillo roadkill stewed in rotten tomatoes. Being forced to watch this movie for 16 hours per day for the remainder of their lives should be used as an alternative to lethal injection for the most vile of criminals, except that all members nations of the UN would agree it would be a gross violation of human rights and that deep frying convicts while live would be more humane.Novels by many great writers are made into bad movies. This is often because the genius of the novels lies in how the writer tells the story rather than the story itself being outstanding in some way. Stephen King could write instruction for knotting a necktie and produce a terrifyingly suspenseful short story for this, while the film adaption would be result in a moderate useful YouTube video with 8 ""Likes"".In many cases the work of adapting a great novel into a good screenplay can be harder than writing an original screenplay. For those that disagree, I suggest yet another food analogy. The leftovers from a wonderfully cooked meal are harder to use as ingredients for an equally good meal the following day, with the exception perhaps of soups and stews, which can sometimes benefit from the time sitting to allow flavors to mix. You can't make a great omelet for brunch by using the leftovers from a great soufflé from last night's dinner. The problems with this movie go well beyond a bad adaption of a great novels. This screenplay is more akin to really bad Fan Fiction of the Twilight Movies and books. The story jumps about in short, badly edited scenes like a cheap slasher film rather than what should be expected from a high budget production. While the first book of the series was the masterpiece, I enjoyed all of them a great deal. When the second, third, and fourth installments were published, I re-read all the prior ones before reading the new one. This wasn't because of failing to remember, but rather because I did remember how much I enjoyed the prior experience and wanted to enjoy the climax again. (Get your mind from the gutter; I meant literary climax.) Since the next three were released in more rapid succession, I only read the first 4 once again before before reading the rest in succession. Idris Elba is my favorite current actor, and I like many of Matthew McConaughey other films tremendously as well. Ordinarily I would have watched a movie just to see Katheryn Winnick, who plays Jake's mom, since I've watched all 5 season of Viking's mainly because she is so unbelievably sexy when killing guys with a sword. With all of the resources available to them, the producers, writers, and director have made an exceptionally bad movie. I had read many bad reviews of this movie but wanted to see it anyway. I often have quirky tastes and enjoy things that others don't, while also disliking many (well perhaps most) big, mega-blockbuster movies, so I thought I might like it. I wish I had re-watched Matthew McConaughey in ""Mud"" instead, or perhaps turned off the sound and gave in to the urge to fall asleep, which this movie powerfully induces.This movie is a waste of 90 minutes you'll never get back.",The Dark Tower

I have been reading some of the user reviews, and things like ""more like inspired by, not based on"" or ""small budget - couldn't have been done better"" - really caught my eye. People who give positive reviews, are wrong. Sorry. It's a fact. Sure. The movie is entertaining, Idris Elbra is awesome. But what the majority of the people don't seem to realize, is that it is meant to be a CONTINUATION of the books. That is were it all falls! FAILS really. SPOILER!!!!! The book series ends were it starts, with Roland chasing Walter through the desert, something we learn he is doing over and over again. There is really no telling how many times the two of them already faced each other, and neither how many times Roland still has to go through the agonizing quest of saving the Dark Tower. Might be just one last time since Roland now carries the Horn of Eld... King even tweeted this, (https://twitter.com/StephenKing/status/733244613000069120) and Walter saying something in the way of ""one last dance around the wheel old friend"" kind of gives it away as well...

688,ledbetter-johnathan,A boring cash-in from a non-reader of the books.,3,7 August 2017,"The Dark Tower, is personally the biggest summer film series cash in so far. Going into this film, the only things that I knew about the material was the trailers and reports of Post-Production issues.Upon viewing, the post production issues are quite clear. The film seems to not know if it wishes to be Sci-Fi Action or a Sci-Fi Drama. All of the films best action scenes (besides the final climax action shot) were used to advertise the film, and considering that the film was heavily advertised this makes viewing the film overwhelmingly boring.It truly felt like there was an additional hour of film that was cut, as we have large sections of the film that seem rushed such as the Gunslinger and the Childs bonding. The Gunslinger had a great ""fish out of water"" sequence near the end of the film where he is treated in a hospital and then drinks soda and takes antibiotics and his reaction is quite entertaining. This contrasts to the climax fight scene where he tosses a canister of propane, which raises the question of how he would know to use this.As someone who did not read the books, the film was overwhelmingly drab and ultimately, not worth the money spent.

Also it's time to unhook from the color of the Gunslinger's skin. Prior to watching the movie, I was skeptical about this moment. But Elba well conveyed the character of the Gunslinger.

I learned a long time ago that if I'm going to watch a movie that's based on a book, I have to separate the two in my mind, so the movie not being like the book(s) doesn't bother me.With that in mind, this movie was awesome for me. It was dark without being depressingly so, and the action sequences were so well-done I didn't even find myself complaining about how unrealistic they were (which I tend to do a lot). It never dragged, and the characters were all well-played.I'm actually surprised by how much I like this movie, because it has a lot of things in it that usually turn me off right away. Troubled kid with dead and/or divorced parents getting in trouble at school; the whole reluctant hero thing; and of course Matthew McConaughey, whom I normally am lukewarm about but absolutely loved in this film. He made an incredible villain here. In spite of all those things, though, it all just WORKED for me! Even the 'troubled kid' character didn't annoy me, which they almost always do.McConaughey wasn't the only great character here, either. Idris Elba was perfect for the role of the Gunslinger and pulled off an amazing performance.In short, if you're watching this film scowling at the screen and muttering about how it isn't like the books, lighten up!

Most of the story went a little bit too fast and they should have tried to give the characters more depth.But on the whole I loved the movie and to see images behind the books.

Such as the cinematography, the characters and the acting. However it is utterly ruined by the terrible pacing of it down to the film makers and most probably the studios. They tried to cram what could of easily of been 2,3 or even 4 movies into 90 minutes and this totally ruins the movie. However that is where the negatives end the story even how rushed and crammed it is does draw you in and you do gain an attachment to the characters. Speaking of which the acting was spot on from the main characters especially Idris Elbas character the only bad part is again. Down to the pacing his characters story arc is so rushed and jumps in leaps and bounds and he doesn't get to develop his character as much as he can. Matthew Mcconaughey's character however the progression of his character does seem seem to fit the film. With its fast pace his characters arc though underdeveloped matches the film so that can be seen as a positive and a negative. The action sequences are brilliantly shot and the keep you on the edge of your seat. The locations are and cinematography are stunning and just turn the movie perfectly. In conclusion The Dark Tower could have been a great movie or a great series of movies if they didn't try to rush the whole thing and cram what 3 movies needed into 1 that's only 90 minutes long and is a missed opportunity. 6.2/10",The Dark Tower

So much has been missed out. The doors on the beach, Eddie, Odetta Holmes/Detta Walker/Susannah Dean, Oy, Lud, Blaine the Train, the back story that was the catalyst (at least in my opinion) that made me feel for Roland... all this and more is sadly missing from this film...

I think that for someone who has never read the books, the movie will be considered a good enough adventure, however for someone, like myself who has been a fan of the Dark Tower books for 30 years, it was a disappointment. I only hope that the TV series, if it is made, will be much better and stay true to the books. Perhaps Peter Jackson should have been involved in the making of the movie. I'm sure he would have made at least one movie for each book and given us a chance to get to know Roland and his Ka-Tet.

With the fate of the worlds at stake, good and evil will collide in the ultimate battle as only Roland can defend the Tower from the Man in Black. Just got back from seeing The Dark Tower a movie that for many months since the trailer dropped out really got my attention until a few days ago when i saw the reviews which were awful and i told to myself instead of hearing the site that gave Ghostbusters a 73% and Alien Covenant a 71% maybe i should go and check out the film? and be the one who judges it and i just got back from the Theater and the only thing i'm thinking right now is that this movie is f*cking amazing from special effects to acting. Matthew McConaughey as Walter or most known as The Man in Black was perfection every time that he was on screen it was magic, he is a ruthless badass villain that he can kill you even without touching you plus his mind games were just creepy as f*ck. Idris Elba as Roland the last Gunslinger is basically perfection too he is the Batfleck of this movie he goes around shooting people with the most badass way i have ever seen in a movie in my entire life, the dude is Chuck Norris and the social justice warriors that were bitching about the fact that the Gunslinger is black instead of white? They should really go and jump from a cliff because Elba is a great actor and 2nd of all he was perfect for the role. Plus the kid Jake he was great as well, he had the b@lls to go against The Man in Black and even try to block him from entering inside his mind. Also i really loved those people that they used human skin as a distraction to enter our world. The action was freaking terrific especially the battle between The Gunslinger and The Man in Black was one of the many great parts of this film and that scene where Roland goes around shooting people in the Village and Walter's hideout were so epic i mean seriously great special effects and great cinematography. The soundtrack is excellent and knows when to hit you and it hits you hard, the whole story of 'fish out of water' was also pretty good it had levity and great humor especially the scene in the bus with the Coca-Cola or the one in the Hospital and it kinda reminded me a lot of Last Action Hero (1993) when Jack Slater visited New York and he was so confused about our world and our everyday things and it was pretty funny. The film also has a pretty good drama like the whole part of Roland and Steven his dad or Jake and his mother and the ending was also unexpected i was expecting it to end like Last Action Hero (1993) but they went to a much different and much better direction. The only flaw that i found with the movie was that it was short i wish that it was somewhere around 2, 5 or even 10 hours that is how much i loved The Dark Tower and honestly i haven't read the books but right now? I kinda want to and i'm definitely getting those Diamond Select Figures. Overall without saying more i just loved this film and i'm so happy that i did not heard critics or Rotten Tomatoes and i went to see the film on my own and judge it on my own. If you haven't read the books i think you're going to enjoy it a lot maybe as much as i did but if you have then you might get disappointed but honestly it's the most underrated Stephen King movie adaptation i have seen so far plus there are some references to The Shining (1980) and other King movie adaptations and to be fair with you people this is definitely in my Top 5 favorite Stephen King films and it goes somewhere like this: 1) The Shining 2) Misery 3) The Running Man 4) The Dark Tower 5) 1408. Also this quote from the movie is dedicated to you guys: I do not aim with my hand. He who aims with his hand has forgotten the face of his father. I aim with my eye. I do not shoot with my hand. He who shoots with his hand has forgotten the face of his father. I shoot with my mind. I do not kill with my gun. He who kills with his gun has forgotten the face of his father. I kill with my heart.",The Dark Tower

And in the book we learn Roland must begin his quest, again and, again, as he has before. Could this not be one version of his repeated life? With such a vast amount of worlds, would it truly be unthinkable to the possibility, that there other versions of these same people. This is still Stephen Kings created world. All things are possible, no matter how crazy they may seem!It is a well done quick movie about The Gunslinger. The actors were perfect.

This movie is like taking a 50 dollar piece of steak and putting it in a blender with ketchup, butter pecan ice cream and dried cat food and then drinking it over ice. The books on which this movie was very loosely based contained thousands of pages of rich story built around a hero's quest through something that was a sort of fun house ruins of our own world. The movie is a hodgepodge of bad sci-fi clichés with the only obvious connection to the book being the names of the characters and their decision to crib a few lines directly from the books. After that the similarities end.No real story, no characters, nothing original. If this was just a run of the mill money grab based on a script hashed together by sweaty monkeys during a drunken weekend binge it would have fit neatly as a direct to video B movie and may have even been worth a 3/10 but that isn't what this is. This movie defiled a work of art. It is nearly criminal.If you love the books you will hate the film. If you have never read the books you will merely find it tedious, boring, and unoriginal.

In short......Why oh why did you even bother?
What surprises me is how did Stephen King allowed this film to be released? You can't shove an epic, 8 book story, into 95 mins of film. Then, when you do, you take the abhorrent advantage of artistic licence by producing a film which, at best, is loosely based on the books, and when I say loosely I mean pants with no belt hanging around your shins loosley.

If you read the books then you have to go in to this movie with the understanding that this is NOT a screen adaption of the book. If that is what you are expecting then you will be highly disappointed (and I'm guessing that this is why it has so many negative reviews)! In fact about the only things that this movie has in common with the book are that there is a gunslinger, there is a man in black and there is a tower. Similarities end there! LOL! However, like I said I really enjoyed this movie. Just keep in mind that it is a film that is kind of sort of set in the Dark Tower universe and that it is not any one of the actual novels that you may have read. Matthew McConaughey and Idris Elba both deliver great performances as Walter (the man in black) and Roland (the gunslinger) I was expecting a much longer epic of a movie and thought that it was a tad short which may explain why my son said that he thought the story was rushed. Anyway two thumbs up from me! I'm sure that someone will trash me now for liking this movie but I did really like it, in fact I thought it was a minor epic.

Instead of putting thought and planning into something that could have made box office billions we got a thrown together mash up mix up of several books that resemble very little of what the subject matter is supposed to be.Now don't get me wrong, the movie had it's good points, and as a stand alone movie, based on the Stephen King world and related to the gunslinger series it would have been good.

733,neuromancer-92174,My opinion if that's even worth anything.,4,25 August 2017,I have read all seven books multiple times and was excited to hear a movie was in the works. Then i heard Ron Howard dropped it and was devastated. The movie on its own without ever having read the books is not bad. Fans of the books expecting a true adaptation were expecting the impossible. If Ron had stayed on this may have been a better movie. Personally i think Netflix should have been all over this as series. That way more of the story details could be implemented over time instead of being watered down and force fed to us in a hour and half movie. The only thing I will say is this movie may spark interest in the younger generation to read the books or at least listen to the audio books. I think the writers of this movie wrote themselves into a corner ending it the way they did. How a sequel will work will take some imaginative writing because they ended it so abruptly. Oh well at least we can still escape to mid-world anytime we want just by picking up the books.,The Dark Tower

Like much of Stephen King's writing, The Dark Tower saga can run long and have pacing issues at times, so of course there will be parts that do not make it into the movie. However, only about 1% of the source material made it. The tone and story are completely different. Several beloved main characters are missing, and the plot points they did use were definitely not the most epic or memorable. They stripped away everything that made The Dark Tower saga beloved and took only the parts that would make a forgettable sci-fi flick. Watching this movie is a waste of time.",The Dark Tower
736,barikasaya,Don't Believe the malicious haters!.,10,16 November 2017,"The Dark Tower is a 2017 American science fantasy western film directed and co-written by Nikolaj Arcel. A continuation of Stephen King's novel series of the same name, the film stars Idris Elba as Roland Deschain, a gunslinger on a quest to protect the Dark Tower—a mythical structure which supports all realities—while Matthew McConaughey plays his nemesis, Walter Padick, the Man in Black, and Tom Taylor stars as Jake Chambers, a New York boy who becomes Roland's apprentice.Its budget is 60 million dollars which means that the producers spent much money to make this movie great.Eleven-year-old Jake Chambers experiences visions involving a Man in Black who seeks to destroy a Tower and bring ruin to the Universe, and a Gunslinger who opposes him. Jake's mother, stepfather, and psychiatrists dismiss these as dreams resulting from the trauma of his father's death the previous year.At his apartment home in New York City, a group of workers from an alleged psychiatric facility offer to rehabilitate Jake; recognizing them from his visions as monsters wearing human skin, he flees. Jake tracks down an abandoned house from one of his visions, discovers a high-tech portal, and travels to a post-apocalyptic world called Mid- World.In Mid-World, Jake encounters the last Gunslinger, Roland Deschain who emerged in his visions. Roland is pursuing Walter Padick, the Man in Black who had also appeared in Jake's dreams, across a desert, seeking to kill him in revenge for the murder of his father, Steven, and all remaining gunslingers. He explains that Walter, over the decades, has been abducting psychic children, and is attempting to use their ""shine"" to bring down the Dark Tower, a fabled structure located at the center of the Universe; this will allow beings from the darkness outside to invade and destroy reality.Roland takes Jake to a village to have his visions interpreted by a seer. Learning of Jake's escape and journey to Mid-World, Walter investigates and discovers from his minion Sayre that Jake has ""pure Shine"", i.e. enough psychic potential to destroy the Tower single- handedly. He kills Jake's stepfather, then interrogates his mother about his visions and kills her too. In Mid-World, the seer explains that Roland can find Walter's base of operations in New York. Walter's minions, the Taheen, attack the village, but Roland individually kills each of them. Roland and Jake return to Earth. When Jake returns home to check in on his mother, he finds her charred remains and breaks down. Roland vows to kill Walter ""for both of us"" and comforts Jake by teaching him the Gunslinger's Creed, which he hasn't uttered since his own father's death, as well as the basics of gun fighting.As Roland re-arms himself at a gun store, he is attacked by Walter, who captures Jake. At his base, he straps Jake to a machine that will use him to destroy the Tower. Jake uses his psychic powers to alert Roland to his location, and Roland battles his way through Walter's henchmen. Walter confronts Roland, wounding him. After Jake reminds him of the Gunslinger's Creed, Roland recovers and kills Walter with a trick shot after a brief fight. Roland destroys the machine, saving the Tower, Jake, and the other children.Afterwards, Roland says that he must return to his own world and offers Jake a place by his side as his companion. Jake accepts the offer as he has nowhere else to go, and the two depart for Mid-World.Don't listen to the biased critics who never saw this great film,see it yourself and make your own judgment!.",The Dark Tower
737,legendsk-82148,Good solid fun movie - Great intro to the DT septology,8,19 July 2021,"Good actors, well cast, playing their rolls skillfully, what's not to like? Well, the story from probably the best modern writer in the world, took him eight, (roughly 1,000 page), volumes to tell. How can you cram that or even a significant portion of it, into a 95 minute movie? And they didn't.This movie is composed of short clips of scenes from each of the volumes where main characters are built, the plot is explained, the environment so skillfully described - no, make that painted and some interesting events are presented. There is nothing in the movie that isn't somewhere in the books. But the screen writers, who must surely have had some help from the man himself, started at the beginning of Vol 1, hop, skipped and jumped through all 8 and then ended at the beginning of Vol 1. It is rather like a trailer for the 8 volume detailed version.There is enough entertaining material in those eight volumes for a movie around 400 hours long. That is an awful lot of your life to spend on one story, but then it's a good story. Remember where Mr. King said the idea for the story came from.So let us King fans and those who like a good story, hope that someone skilled will put together a movie(s) covering the whole series in the detail it deserves and this particular movie ""Dark Tower"" will be only the introduction and it will then be apparent how well it performed its mission.",The Dark Tower

Nope - in the day where they turn 300 page short stories into 9 hour marathons (I'm looking at you Hobbit,) this massive epic was dwindled down to 1.5 hours. I was actually enjoying the movie, it was moving the plot along and then like hitting a brick wall at 200 mph, it was over. Having not read the series I was left feeling hollow and not having a freaking clue what happened, or why any of the story was even important.And for all the power the Man in Black was shown to have, he went down like he was a minion.It actually felt like the director was 70m into editing what he envisioned being a 2.5h movie when the studio came in and said it was going to be 90m. You can almost hear it in the story around 80m in, ""screw-it, here's your movie""...I've seen worse - but that's a far cry from this being worth watching.

A movie with such big names as Matthew McConaughey, Idris Elba and Katheryn Winnick, is always expected to be a good thing. In this movie, what for the story that is, only has only 95min? It is very little, which causes the story to pass very fast and without important details. Details of how Jake (Tom Taylor) defeats a demon? And then you can not defeat another demon, when one appears in the forest? They do not understand why. Details like these that make the film a bit confusing and not very explicit. Something that is also not detailed is the power Roland (Idris Elba) has to manage to face Walter (Matthew McConaughey). Something positive in this movie is the way Walter kills his opponents. At this point Matthew McConaughey performs well. The final part reminded me of the movie Wanted, where the characters can do tricks with bullets coming out of their pistols. Something that does not make much sense in this movie, because one more, wizards against gunslinger, you can not understand how the gunslinger has the power to defeat the greatest wizard of the universes.

Don't fall for the excuse that this is another level of the Tower, it's not, taking many elements of a fantastic series of books and throwing them together in a 91min mush mash results in only one thing.

I really enjoyed it. Even down to an ending that could have been played out rather differently, but took a sensible route instead. I have seen others mention Never Ending Story as a parallel and I can sort of understand why although there is a darker undertone here and the emotional aspect of the story I think was handled well.My advice?

The kid is also doing a decent job, but that's secondary since I wasn't awed by him in any way.If you want a modern take on a spaghetti western with a budget that seemingly was way out of proportion where the whole movie is carried by big actors, smoke and mirrors (read: special effects).

They clearly only used the basic information and didn't take a ton of time building characters which would have been nice. I would prefer to see a series of 4-5 movies come out for the whole series but this was enjoyable. Idris Elba did a great job.",The Dark Tower

The story line is only vaguely based on the series, and I am using ""vaguely"" very liberally. The language is not correct, it's missing major characters, it's not The Dark Tower, and can only be described as a missed opportunity to tell a tremendous story over several movies.This movies fails on thousands of points.

754,jolamilove,Pure Disappointment.,1,7 August 2017,With literally 1000's of pages of vivid inspired source material why would they go totally off script and try to completely reinvent the story and characters? The first 1/4 of the movie is a lame mother/son/stepdad family drama with Jake. The second quarter is your brief window into mid world where you get to see none of the amazing backdrops from the books. The last half is cowboy in the city and a Hollywood ending. No mentions of Ka. No Ka Tet. No Gunsliger mythos/history except for some completely unimaginative flashback of Roland fighting along side his dad in the final battle of the gunslingers. Completely terrible.,The Dark Tower

757,edmerlin,Thuroughly Disgusting,1,25 August 2017,"I, as others have stated, am giving this one star simply because zero stars is not an option. I am shocked at the few good reviews this movie has received from a small percentage of reviewers. I am a huge fan of the original content, which is so far removed from this cinematic bowel movement it can be compared to ""The Lawnmower Man"" for it's ludicrous claim of being based on a Stephen King story. To anyone unfamiliar with The Dark Tower series, written by Stephen King, it is a sprawling 7 novel narrative tying together elements from a lot of other popular SK novels (The Shining, Salem's Lot, The Talisman etc.) All of the best aspects of this series was cut and reduced to a confusing, comic-book mash-up of details whittled down to the most basic and unimaginative ideas contained within TDT series.Other people have gone on about the injustice done to the original work, so I will stop now and just talk about the movie as a stand-alone offering. Imagine you asked a ten year old child to power through George R R Martin's Game of Thrones novels and then waited a couple of months to ask him/her to write a quick synopsis of the plot on construction paper with a crayon. Then you give that outline to a German director, having never directed an English language movie, and asked him to film that outline. You would get Game of Thrones in a 1 hour 35 minute movie, as remembered by a 10 year old.That is what The Dark Tower is. Interesting for all the wrong reasons.Effective at stirring up real emotions of anger,resentment,disappointment and anguish, for all the wrong reasons.Keeping watchers on the edge of their seat, trying to decide whether they should walk out or wait and see just how corny Mathew M was going to get and how horribly he would over-act. I am a huge fan of Idris Elba and believe he must have been coerced into this role. I am thinking Nikolaj Arcel kidnapped the woman he loved and threatened to send him pieces of her until he signed the contract.(Luther) If you haven't had the misfortune of seeing this film yet, do yourself a favor and see Baby Driver, Wonder Woman, The Hit-man's Bodyguard or hell, even The Emoji Movie. I can't assure you a BETTER movie-going experience, especially with The Emoji movie as I have not seen it, I can, however, assure you with complete and total honesty, that you could not possibly have a worse movie-going experience. I hated this movie so much that I created an IMDb account just to post this one and hopefully only review.EM",The Dark Tower

Fortunately a friend of mine has been watching and she thinks this movie is very good.So finally I invite my family to watch together and we all agree that this movie is very good and very worth watching.The plot of the movie is also interesting to me. There is an element of mystery in it, but it does not make the audience have to think hard to digest the whole story. Scene after scene is also well displayed and fun to look at.There are many elements of action in this film and every action scene is displayed very well so that we also feel the tension and excitement in it.

The Dark tower has its holes but all in all Idris Elba played his role really well as did Matthew McConaughey he came across so dark. If you threw this movie back to a time when we didn't see criticism as a sign of intelligence say the late 80s this would be reviewed as a classic. I am from the era of Die Hard, pulp fiction, were these to be thrown into this era they would be straight to DVD and the reviews would be a lot different. So can we please give credit where credit is due the dark tower has great cinematography and awesome soundscapes and credit has also got to be given for today's actors they act there best in a green clad room which in fact is really a multi universe and there is a goblin behind them.

Three years later, recorded on tv as a whim (extra time with Covid and all) and decided to watch with my husband - who hasn't read any of the books. I was prepared to be disappointed. Yes, it was not the books, but the heart of the story was there, and I ended up enjoying it.
My husband loved it. Free of expectations, he was able to enjoy the good versus evil, the other-worlds, and the flawed characters.
Is it Stephens King's masterpiece? A resounding no. Is it an escape from reality, with interesting characters and story? Yes. I recommend setting aside pre-conceived notions and enjoying it.",The Dark Tower

Probably a good movie if you've never read the books. There was nothing ""Dark Tower"" about it. No Eddie, no Susannah, no Oy! Everything about this movie is just so wrong. There was no depth to it.

762,apollohonda,"This movie is a sequel to the spectacular book series, not an adaptation, but...",6,20 August 2017,"There's definitely something missing in the entire movie that can detract from the whole experience. For those looking for a faithful ""adaptation"" of the books... Please don't hold your breath, because this isn't it. The original epic ended on an... ambiguous note that left Roland (The Gunslinger) in possession of something that could change the state of the pasts, presents, and futures of all of creation. This film picks up sometime thereafter and is meant to be a canonical sequel to that series that may or may not have a definite ending. With that being said this is definitely a more action oriented popcorn style movie meant to entertain, and on that note- just misses the mark. There's a dearth of entertainment in this movie that is all kinds of baffling. Part of the trouble might be the absolute treasure trove of backstory and history that want into creating the world of the Dark Tower and the rest can be chalked up to good old Hollywood dollar signs. This is the first in a series and as such was meant to make an impact and drum up interest to those not familiar with the original (and expanded) material. It's an unfortunate choice and sadly that's where things go pear shaped. I really wanted to like this movie more than I did but it just didn't captivate at all. The performances by the leads were acceptable but the editing of the movie makes everything feel rushed and forced. Moreover, that very same editing seemingly puts Roland (Idris Elba) in a supporting role that shifts the whole tone of the story... it wrecks the experience. Watch the movie at least once, whenever you choose to of course, just to get the experience for yourself but be ready for a jumbled, typical Hollywood styled experience. The alternate/director's cut and sequels, if there end up being any, may pick up the slack but at this point it wouldn't be surprising they didn't. 6/10.",The Dark Tower
763,comicempguy,Ka like a Wheel,7,5 August 2017,"Ka like a Wheel; a phrase repeated often in the books refers to fate being like a wheel in that it rolls on and on and you can either roll with it or be crushed by it. What goes around, comes around is another way of looking at it and Everything's Eventual is still another. There are a lot of things wrong with this movie however there are a lot more things right with it. First off, Robin Furth had a hand in the story and if that name is unfamiliar to you, you have forgotten the face of your father. Robin is the majordomo behind Marvel's amazing Dark Tower comic book series. She was also Stephen King's personal consultant when crafting the second half of his epic series of novels. In Mr. King's own words (and also in my opinion) ""She knows this stuff better than I do."" So, be sure that the minds behind this movie have a deep understanding and appreciation of the source material. Secondly, this is not an adaptation. This is an original story set in the same universe as the novels. If you followed the series you know that there are other worlds than these and this movie takes place in one of those other infinite possibilities. There are echoes of the books of course, enough to earn a knowing chuckle from the Constant Reader and enough Stephen King Easter Eggs to fill a basket of Youtube ""What you Missed"" type videos. The characters are true to themselves. Jake is Jake, Roland is Roland, and Matthew McConaughey's Walter o'Dim a.k.a Randall Flagg a.k.a. The Man in Black is so deliciously vile his performance alone is worth the price of admission. If you're a Stephen King fan you owe it to yourself to see this new chapter in Roland's eternal quest. Certainly the movie has problems just as certainly as the books did. Just ignore the ending as much as you did the last two books and you'll have a great time.",The Dark Tower

Matthew McConaughey played an excellent villain, and the rest of the cast did a great job as well. In my opinion, it was worth watching in the theater.

Wish it played out just a few more minutes of suspense. So I never write reviews, but this movie got a lot of crap thrown at it due to book readers harsh critics. If you haven't read the books, this movie will make you want to. That's a good thing. The movie was shorter then expected, but they nailed, a lot together in that time.

I saw the very first showing, and I can say that the negative reviews coming out about this film are unwarranted. First, you have to keep in mind what they were hoping to achieve with this movie given the budget. It's a similar play to that of the first Hunger Games movie. If they get some traction with this one, then the subsequent movies/TV series get twice the money to work with. I personally think that they did a fantastic job with this first effort. The acting was solid. The story was actually pretty good. It had some great actions sequences, and the CGI was surprisingly good (most of the time). It was also a very efficient use of time. Every scene helped explain the Dark Tower lore to new audiences. It was a fun action flick that doesn't try to repeat the experience of reading the books. I'll always have the novels. I wasn't expecting this movie to recreate that experience for me.Plus, as a die hard fan from way back, it was just great to see Roland and Jake on screen for the first time. It just felt right.

It's it's own story and it's a crappy one told on a budget with horrible casting, a mushy, utterly banal script and totally standard special effects. It is literally the worst book adaption brought to film I've ever seen. Stephen King and all involved... you have forgotten the faces of your fathers. Shame on you.

776,chassit-72060,Bad beyond your wildest imagination,1,5 August 2017,"Being a tower junkie for over a decade, I honestly don't have much expectation on this movie adaption. Much of The Dark Tower series' charm comes from Stephen King's narration, which doesn't easily convert into the visual language of movies. Since the bar was set extremely low, I thought there's no way I could be disappointed in the cinema.But dude, this Nikolaj Arcel guy has one heck of a way to prove me wrong.Judging by what's revealed in trailers, I thought this one should cover The Gungslinger and *part of* Drawing of the Three, starting a whole franchise, with more installments to follow. But no. The director took pieces from all seven Tower books, glued them onto a self-made storyline (a lame one), and called it a day. Yes, you're reading it right. This is the whole thing, the entire package. What kind of idiotic mind ever thinks of packing SEVEN novels into ONE SINGLE movie?Within 1.5 hours you will see Roland Deschain fighting the army of the Man in Black (vol IV), having his ass handed to him, embarking on a chase (vol I), picking up Jake Chambers from New York (vol I & II), although the Jake in this movie is really Jake Chambers and Patrick Danville rolled into one (vol VII). They fooled around in Mid-world for a bit, then discovered Algul Siento (vol VI), where the Man in Black's force are hording up breakers to destroy the Dark Tower. In order the thwart the evil operation, they went to this village that looks suspiciously like Calla Bryan Sturgis (vol V), activated a portal to Keystone Earth, trying to infiltrate en route the can-toi headquarter, a restaurant called Dixie Pig (vol VII). Then there comes a ton of pew pew pew and bang bang bang. All baddies died, including the Man in Black (vol WTF). They destroyed the tower-breaking machine, and lived happily ever after (vol WTF). End of story.No Oy. No Eddie Dean. No Susannah Holmes. Even the Crimson King is axed, while references to him can be seen everywhere in the movie. This version of Roland didn't even attempt to enter the Tower.I've thought hard, for nice things to say about this movie, and came up with only the following: 1. All sorts of creative reloading techniques.2. Walter O'Dim is super duper kickass cool in the movie adaption, way cooler than in the original novels. Matthew McConaughey did portray the ""Walking Dude"" true to his name, always on the move, casually passing through lives and worlds, leaving havoc in his wake.Otherwise... it's a dozen bucks wasted. Should have donated it to the charity.BTW, IMDb should change its rating mechanism a bit, allowing us to give a 0 rate.Oh, there's one nice touch at the very beginning of the movie. Among the names and logos of producers and investors, there's a screen featuring ""Tet Corporation"", accompanied by a turtle and a rose, kindling false hope in me.",The Dark Tower

There are a few things here and there I have a beef with but overall it was quite entertaining and well made I thought. My biggest beef of which was casting McConaughey as the man in black. I like him, he's a great actor, but I just don't think he knows how to be truly sinister as I suspect would be appropriate for such a character. I can think of so many more genuinely creepy actors.Also the whole ""bad guy acts like he's this supernatural villain, yet he operates out of some Star Trek base camp"" just didn't seem sinister enough to my liking. But other than those two gripes, it was a great movie.",The Dark Tower
778,kenwendlandcom,In the Spirit of the Books,9,5 August 2017,"Read these reviews carefully. Note the objections people give to the film. I see the negative reviews are predominately people who expected a direct adaptation of the books, whereas this is more a continuation of the story. This is the next time Roland journeys to the tower, not the same journey we all read about and love.Also note the five star reviews are King fan boys who would give five stars to any Stephen King movie just to see more of them made, and because in their eyes, Stephen King can do no wrong. Neither of these groups help here.I sit somewhere in between. I've read the series many times, more than is probably healthy. I know these stories inside and out. And I loved the movie. It has it's flaws, as every movie does, but it is faithful to the spirit of the books. It was very clear from all the hype and communications we got from Stephen King and others leading up to this release, that this movie would not follow the books exactly, so I did not enter the theater with false expectations. That is key. When you go to see this movie, expect it to follow its own path. Remember, their are other worlds than these.I was worried about how Idris Elba would work as Roland. Let me tell you, he owns that role. He became the gunslinger. His performance was spot on.And Matthew Mcconaughey absolutely nailed the Man in Black role. He is so evil, it permeated from the screen. Some of the dialogue was terrible, but that is the writers fault, and he delivered what he was given beautifully.Tom Taylor was the unknown. He did a decent job. He is no Haley Joel Osment or Jacob Tremblay, but he is a capable young actor who plays Jake Chambers well enough.My biggest complaint about the movie is it's run time. It felt rushed, and certain things needed explained better. So much of the imagery was only meaningful if you've read all of the books. But having said all that, it was a good movie. It held my attention the entire time, and I literally got goose bumps several times through the film. The fish out of water humor with Roland in our world's New York was amazing, and I cannot wait to watch this again.Go watch the movie with an open mind. Don't expect it to be the same as the books, but expect it to be in the spirit of the books. You will be entertained.",The Dark Tower

781,megan_is_my_name,I truly don't understand all the hate,8,6 August 2017,"First of all, let me mention that I am, like many others, a fan of the series by Stephen King. I'm a Stephen King fanatic in general but these books were my addiction. As a fan, I don't see what everyone else is complaining about. The movie definitely wasn't perfect but I found it absolutely enjoyable from beginning to end. Do I think it would have been better if they'd stuck to the original story and made it into an HBO or Netflix type series? Of course! But I still think they did an excellent job writing a new story-line inspired by the books that would fit into one movie and appeal to a larger audience. Having seen the trailers first, I knew to expect a completely different story than the one I'd read. Having read the reviews beforehand, I went to see the movie out of curiosity but with zero expectations. I had prepared myself for the worst. And I was pleasantly surprised.Idris Elba is amazing as the Gunslinger. Fans of the books might complain that his motives aren't as ""pure"" as they were in the book - intent on killing the Man in Black and not caring whether the Tower was destroyed. In my opinion, however, you can compare his obsession with the MIB in the movie with his obsession with Walter in the first book of the series (don't forget book fans, he even let Jake die in order to catch him). I thought all the action scenes with the Gunslinger were mesmerizing and terribly exciting - maybe a little ""Hollywood-ized"" in an attempt to meet the standards of today's Blockbuster action scenes, but still so much fun to watch. I also thought Matthew McConaughey was great as the Man in Black - cool, calm, and terrifying. The ""fake skins"" were creepy as hell and a great addition to the movie to give it a horror quality. And any fan of the books complaining about the main plot being the MIB using Jake's ""shine"" to destroy the Tower must not read many other Stephen King books. King loves to use psychic ability and supernatural powers in many of his books. It may not have been a main plot point in the Dark Tower series, but it still had elements of King's style and I loved it.All in all, I was not disappointed I saw this movie at all. I had a great experience and enjoyed every minute!",The Dark Tower
782,jakerachon,"Entertaining, but...",6,7 August 2017,"This movie suffers from an incomplete vision. First off, 95 minutes? They could have added 20 minutes to the film and helped it a lot. Unless you've read the books, this movie really does nothing to explain the situation, other than a few words at the beginning that even then does not tell you much.They could have at least gave a little background on the gunslingers to explain why they are who they are, and a little background on the tower...that alone might have helped moviegoers understand a little bit more about what they were watching. The Dark Tower series is 8 books, and while they didn't need to make a Lord of the Rings epic spread out over all the books, they could have at least added a little time to the movie to help. Acting was not bad by anybody...Elba was really solid, definitely my favorite part of the film. McConaughey was good as O'dim...although I could not get it out of my head hearing him say 'Party at the Dark Tower'...Dazed and Confused fans will understand that! Taylor was good as a rebellious misunderstood (understandably) youth.I realize books will always have a way of telling a story that cannot be expressed in films, but why do Stephen King's novels seem to suffer the most?Funny Easter Eggs(and I'm wondering what others I missed):The theme park on Mid-World was either named, or had a ride named, Pennywise...The portal where Jake and Roland come back to Keystone Earth is 1408...",The Dark Tower
783,soldiera-17071,Wow these reviewers are a bunch of whiners! Go see it!,9,8 August 2017,"First off, I created a profile on here just to write this review. I felt like I had to because of all the hate for this movie that was completely unwarranted. Sure this movie isn't perfect but is it a fun sci-fi fantasy action movie that hints at a very dark expanded universe? Absolutely! Unfortunately we may never get that expanded universe on the big screen because of the negative reviews pouring out from people that just can't enjoy a good movie and have to have it their way. The director did the best he could with the limited budget and source material he had. Do you really think he could create a movie that followed the books with that budget? There's no way. The Dark Tower is a series that has so much to tell, so many stories and to be honest much of it can't be told on the big screen. It'd be too hard to do so. What we are getting is an introduction to that Stephen King connected universe and while I would have loved more story told, I definitely appreciate the direction the director went with this in order to help people understand the concept of this series. I for one cannot wait for the TV series! Don't let these critics and reviews dissuade you from seeing this movie. Enjoy it for what it is. This is my favorite movie this year and on the list of my all time favorites. Go see this movie!",The Dark Tower
784,rkbutler-29808,Underwhelming - Disappointing - Shallow,1,8 August 2017,"""The man in black fled across the desert, and the gunslinger followed.""Over thirty years ago, I opened Stephen King's ""The Gunslinger"" and I read those twelve words which immediately grabbed my imagination and never let go. Over the course of over twenty years, eight books, and more than 4,200 words I was drawn to King's story of Roland Deschaine and his quest to save the Dark Tower that sits at the center of all worlds and times.There is now a movie of ""The Dark Tower"" which I've waited for years to be made. Unless you're a fan of the series, you're likely unaware of the many big names that have been attached to the movie and how many times the project has started, stopped, and started again. It was maddening for people like me who longed to see the story on film.I saw the movie Sunday night and I'm incredibly disappointed with what I saw. If you don't know the movie, but know Harry Potter, imagine if the first Harry Potter movie took bit parts from each book and threw them together in a senseless order. Then, imagine if the movie made Ron Weasley the primary character and depicted Harry as wanting nothing to do with learning to be a wizard, but just interested in killing Voldemort. Oh, and let's not ever go to Hogwarts. We'll leave out Hermione, Dumbledore, Hagrid and Snape entirely. They were never important to the story anyways.I get that movies are different than books. I get that complex sagas with loyal ""Constant Readers"" are especially challenging to bring to life. I wasn't prepared for the screenwriter and filmmaker's complete disregard for the story, the characters, and the themes that brought the books to life. The key characters, rather than being complex, well-developed, and believable, were shallow without a way for the audience to connect. So much of the narrative was lost that I really don't know how anyone who hasn't read the books would understand much of anything about the movie.I should know better with Stephen King as he's disappointed me before. For every great adaptation ""The Shining"", ""Carrie (the original, not the reboot)"", ""Shawshank Redemption"", and ""Stand By Me"", there are several truly HORRIBLE ones like ""The Stand"", ""The Tommyknockers"", ""Firestarter"", and ""Maximum Overdrive"".If you've read or seen ""Misery"", today I have a far greater appreciation for the anger of Annie Wilkes when she discovered that her favorite character was being killed off in Paul Sheldon's books. After seeing this movie, I wouldn't trust myself if I ever found Stephen King upside down in a crashed car on a snowy mountain road.",The Dark Tower
785,hpodzunv,Entertaining and touching movie,9,8 August 2017,"I don't agree with the people rating the movie badly just because it isn't completely accurate to the books, the movie should be rated on how good it was as a movie.I found The Dark Tower to be a very entertaining and touching movie. There was no point in the movie where I thought there was bad writing or directing, everything seemed well thought over.There is great acting by Idris Elba and Tom Taylor. Definitely would recommend.",The Dark Tower
786,Laurina1986,"Not the books - but a good movie, even for fans of the books!",8,8 August 2017,"As As a huge fan of the Dark Tower books, I simply had to see this movie. Keep in mind the movie is not exact as the books and I believe you find more appreciation for the screening. Idris Elba and Matthew Mcconaughey were perfect for their roles! I loved the fact that there were so many details referring to the books through out the movie (Tet Corporation at the start was brilliant!) and they put in some great quotes / moments too. The reference to IT in the movie was a small bonus for die-hard King fans! My husband did not read the books and he loved the movie too. It does move really quick and there's not a lot of background, a bit more info would have been great for those who don't know anything about the Dark Tower yet. For all the bad reviews this movie has: keep in mind most are people who are unhappy because it's not about the books. Give it a fair chance and you will not be disappointed!",The Dark Tower
787,geoffdice-26027,Pleasantly surprised,8,9 August 2017,"Honestly, I think that this movie is far better than the critics and the fans of the books have made it out to be. It is intended to be a sequel, not an adaptation. It was fun, action-filled, engaging, the plot was accessible (a someone who has never read the series and has been underwhelmed by Stephen King's writing in the past, I didn't know what to expect but was pleasantly surprised), funny, dramatic, and Tom Taylor did a phenomenal job as Jake. It wasn't the most spectacular film ever, and it also wasn't the mess that people have made it out to be. I would definitely see it again, and I went out and bought the first book in the series today, after seeing it last night to see if I could get into it, and see past King's mediocre writing. Perhaps I will be as pleasantly surprised by the books as I was with the movie. On a side note, the racist nonsense that Roland can't be black (especially since this is a reincarnation of the character) - get over it. Elba was fantastic on his role.",The Dark Tower

Let us also not forget the many Guardians of the Rose along the journey as well. Long days and pleasant nights to each and every one of you! Even to the agents of the Crimson King, the story would not be the same without you! Thank you to the 12 Guardians of The Beam and The Rose as well.

789,lordsoliv,A laughable if enjoyable collage of fantasy & sci-fi clichés,5,27 August 2017,"What it says on the tin, basically. The film (poorly) attempts at creating a dark and menacing world in which good people (a talented white boy & a noble black guardian/gunslinger) fight against the evil, which is epitomised by Man in Black. I laughed throughout the whole film, couldn't help myself under the onslaught of half baked action scenes and unconvincing characters who seemed to appear on the screen for the sole purpose of moving the story forward. When they weren't busy highlighting just how great Jake's power is, that is. The acting was surprisingly okay, considering that a lot of ""emotional"" scenes didn't make sense or were downright cringe-worthy. If I enjoyed the film, which I did anyways, it was only because it was such a model example of how not to tell a story of good versus evil.",The Dark Tower
790,russfry,What could have been,1,10 August 2017,"My take on TDT is disappointment. I did read the books and loved the story (except Song of Susannah, that one bored me to tears. Sorry Steven, just being honest). TDT with this cast should have been from another world than this. There was nothing that I would call gripping in the 90 minutes I wasted sitting there. Maybe the movie would have been better if the setting was from another world that has a different gunslinger, (Idris is OK but Roland should not have been the gunslinger in this one), and a Jake type of character similar to the books but not trying to pull 7 novels into a short time span of celluloid. Matthew was boring as well because he just didn't fit the image I had in my head and didn't offer anything that changed it. I'm sorry I am being so down on this movie but for the most part the movie industry, more often than not, makes Steven King stories into terrible movies.I also went to and wasted my money on Planet of the Apes. That bored the hell out of me this go round.",The Dark Tower
791,griffdaddy,The usual slaughter of a great story,3,26 November 2017,"Total slop. Besides trying to cram several thousand pages into 90 minutes or so, This is a chop job as is commonly done to Kings work. Those who watched The Running Man after reading it will experience a similar dissatisfaction. Even if I hadn't read the series, I would not have been impressed. The only kudos I can give to this movie are for the acting and, surprise surprise, the effects and action. The casting wasn't great, but they could have done far worse. Most of the rest of this movie was trash. If you're a King fan, expect to be disappointed. I was and my expectations were very low.",The Dark Tower
792,rivaree,You Won't Be Disappointed,10,11 August 2017,"This movie had all the suspense of an excellent sci-fi flick. If you have ever read, watched or listened to fiction stories, books or movies and enjoyed them, then this is no different. The actors gave stellar performances and the director and producers gave us a very entertaining product. I really could care less about reviews. I have always ignored them, since no one is capable of convincing me he or she knows what entertainment means to me. After all, the operative word is ""entertainment."" Go see the movie, you won't be disappointed.",The Dark Tower
793,ahackl,"Felt a little rushed, but I can see where they want to take this",8,12 August 2017,"Coming from someone who HAS read the books .My only 2 problems with the movie. I do feel like it was perhaps a tad bit rushed. And also the use of the portals/doors was a little too easy. In the books these are used sparingly and usually have epic moments that coincide with them being used. That being said this is another go round for Roland, so things could be a little different this time around. This is definitely a sequel/adaptation as Roland now carries the horn, and for it to be like the books is just not right. As much as I'd love to see Roland sacrifice a certain someone for his fortune to be told, that happened on his last journey. Same goes with his vengeance towards the man in black instead of being obsessed with the tower. This is a new journey, and the gunslinger may have different feelings this time around. It does seem like he's forgotten the face of his father in the film, but maybe that's something different that he has to fight within himself at this point in time. Maybe he's fighting to remember the face of his father as well, and protect the tower. that might be because we haven't been able to see everything that's supposed to happen in this new take of the tower series, so that's hard to say. But that's like just reading the 1st book (the gunslinger) and just giving up and saying it's not good, when there is much more story to be told. We can't judge this to harshly off not seeing the entirety of the story. Besides for the fact it felt crammed/rushed, I thoroughly enjoyed seeing Roland in a gunfight on the big screen, that totally gave me chills. And I could only imagine what future scenes with the entire Ka-tet fighting together would be like in future installments, I get excited thinking about that (if the Ka-tet was to come together in the films)Anyway I thought this film was not even close to as terrible as all the reviews its receiving. I could easily judge it once it was an entire series, but this is supposed to be just the beginning. I enjoyed the movie and would encourage people to go out and make their on judgement of the movie. Stand and be true!",The Dark Tower

795,elcapitan-48302,Directors/producers should be ashamed,1,17 August 2017,"I have read the books but I am not leaving a bad review in spite 9f this. I will explain from both sides. For those not having read the books there is simply no character development at all, I was actually shocked to look at my watch and realise the film was over half way through and nothing of note had been explained. The film is an empty shell of a story devoid of any real plot.the directors and producers should be ashamed of themselves. I actually feel bad writing a negative review about this as I love the series of books but this....this is so far removed from what this could have been it's embarrassing. The only shining light in this is MM as the man in black, sinister, unforgiving and badass but he and no other character is really explored enough not even remotely. I feel really bad for MM and Idris Elba because their characters or so rich, their back stories really build them into what they are. Had they made the trilogy then you could probably get away with it. For those that have read the books on our behalf I would like to say 8 have never been so thoroughly and utterly disappointed in my life. I have waited years for this film to be released only to watch the directors and producers ruin another great story. I can't believe they got paid for filming thia. No Oi, no Eddie no Suzzana, to name but a few, when I finished the books years ago now I was left with a real feeling of loss. I wasn't overly enammered with the ending but it was genius f4om King, this however, when this was over I couldn't be happier. I don't think I have words for how disappointing this film is. MM AND IE a pair of great actors that were given a fraction of the time they should have to pull from some great source material but ruined by awful screenplay and terrible direvtion. What an absolute shame.",The Dark Tower

It's one of the good movies released in this year, with excellent acting by everyone, especially 3 lead characters. The movie was thoroughly enjoyable and pacy. Only downside is that the action towards the end was short. The reason for the negative review, as many have pointed out here, is that the movie did not do proper justice to the books. While, that's true, it doesn't make the movie bad. Quite often we see that screen adaptations are not quite as good as the books, e.g. a song of ice and fire, that doesn't make the screen adaptation bad. To give 1-5 ratings to this movie is wrong, biased,imbalanced and grossly unfair to the people behind this movie.",The Dark Tower

Well, I've gone back three more times, WITH my family, because we all loved it. Matthew McConaughey is perfect as The Man in Black, and after seeing Idris Elba in the role of the Gunslinger, I can't imagine anyone else in it. Tom Taylor, the young actor playing Jake, was super. We loved the storyline and while some viewers commented that the movie was poorly written, we really enjoyed this movie. I've read the Dark Tower series and am not disappointed in this movie adaptation at all. A friend and I went to see the much-heralded, Oscar-nominated Arrival and almost fell asleep -- so I don't really give much credit to movies touted by critics as the next big Oscar winner. You won't waste your money seeing this, and while I've read some are upset the movie is barely over 90 minutes, I felt a lot was accomplished in that time and I never felt shortchanged because the movie wasn't 2+ hours. Yes, there are some differences between the books and the movie but this is still an excellent story...many interesting plot twists and as I said we were very pleased with the casting.

Now Ron Howard of all people has destroyed the Dark Tower story by conforming the ""blackwashing"" of Hollywood. Forcing black actors into white roles after the Academy Awards problem a few years ago is insulting to all of us. Mr. Howard, you should be ashamed of yourself for selling out like this and destroying the long awaited film. As for Idris Elba and Matthew McConaughey, I won't watch any of their films, I just turned of Star Trek Beyond when I saw Idris come up. You have all gone too far.

I've been a fan of the book series for 15 years, and half way through the series couldn't wait for it to become a movie. I had hopes they would put the effort into this that was put into Lord of the Rings or even Harry Potter, instead it was half assed and didn't even remotely follow the storyline. They put their own twist on everything...and somehow Jake isn't Jake he's really more like Danny Torrance from the Shining (WTF??) and somehow The Man In Black has no idea who Jake is, the man who passes between worlds and centuries and never forgets anything...doesn't know who Jake is - yet this is supposedly an after the book series movie. Get the F*** outta here! How Sony and Nikolaj Arcel thought ""hey lets through this all out the window, make it completely our own and I'm positive it will get rave reviews and make us a sh*t ton of money"" I'll never understand...cause guess what...you're all a bunch of idiots who ruined a series that could have been big! No ones going to attempt this series again after this total failure. (and seriously an hour and a half!?!?!?!) Such a disappointment, I can't even convey how much. What's next, are you gonna do The Talisman and bomb that too for the fans!

Lots of action and - despite being somewhat predictable and unconvincing at times, lacking good dialogue and acting at times, and sufficient characterization IMO - it delivered in providing a movie with adequate action scenes, an interesting plot and a few scares as well. But it doesn't quite have that Hollywood western feel to it which I heard it should have, according to SK fans.It is definitely a thrill to watch or at least watchable nonetheless.

The writer and director have always said this is a sequel to the books (and those who read the last book in the series and read the section King warned you not to understand that this take place after it). That being said and once understood the movie becomes fantastic. They aren't retelling the story from the novels they are simply continuing spinning the wheel.Now as for the acting Idris Elba is fantastic as Roland, the man in Black's motivating factors and why it differs from the books as it does is very well conceived. The world is well thought out and as the novels often did relate back to other of King's work in a logical way (The Shining, Dead Zone, etc). All in all it is a great movie.

The reason you enjoyed them, it's because they are from the original work.How the story develops and events occur, however... I can't even say how different they were from the books. It's amazing how can you destroy so many good scenes from the book just by trying to adapt it to the movie format. So many good characters were left out, memorable moments were nonexistent, background stories were never told... It's sad. Imagine if your favorite TV show finally gets a full movie launch in theaters... but when you see it, you find out all that happened in the original is different. The world and it's elements are the same, but the events are all different. This is what goes in the mind of those who have read the books.If you enjoyed the movie, it's fine. What I'm saying is, if you want to have an even greater time, with the same good things from the movie and even more... go read the books.

819,callofduty-79191,Enjoyable for those who have not read the books.,4,24 November 2017,"""The Dark Tower"" is a film I found really enjoyable and gripping for people like me who have not read the books. I was like wow Matthew Mcconnaughey is starring in the film so it's gotta be at least semi- decent right? And it was, but it definitely was not without its problems. Recently there's been multiple films based on Stephen Kings novels coming out and none of them have been too disappointing. But I would have expected more out of a serious big-budget film. The story's about a psychic boy who people want to kidnap because of his psychic powers which are able to destroy the dark tower which is keeping the universe safe from outside threats. As the boy somehow manages to very predictably escape from their grasp he travels to another version of Earth which has been basically wiped out by an apocalypse. There they fight against the evil mastermind who wants to destroy the tower and destroy the universe. The books main strength is the amount of special effects put into it. It's very eye-catching and fantastical. The biggest weakness is that 7 BIG BOOKS have been razed to the ground for 1 90 minute long movie. That is seriously pathetic. I understand not being able to make 7 movies without knowing how the movie will do in sales but seriously. Reducing 8 books down to 1 is like shooting yourself in the foot. The same thing happened to Ender's game and we all know how that turned out. Overall a decent story, not anything special and neither anything too terrible. However it is below expectations for a movie this big and known.",The Dark Tower
820,jdmaki,"Far from Alright, Alright, Alright",1,27 November 2017,"I have been using IMDb for years and this atrocity of a movie is the reason I created an account to post a review. I honestly thought I somehow got the wrong movie and was watching some kind of trailer for the whole series and it was going to be some kind of Stephen King joke at the end and we would get the other 8 movies later. The obvious flaw is 8 books and 90 minutes. The movie was almost over before I realized they were trying to tell the whole story in an hour and a half. I know how hard it can be to turn a book into a movie, much less a horror movie, but come on. SK is banking with these recent releases and I don't think he cares anymore as long as the checks clear. It took him over 20 years for these books to be written and he let them turn it into one short film that was one of the worst of his ever made as far as character development and story line depth. I wish they delivered this movie as ""inspired by the Dark Tower"" rather than connecting it to such a volume or work because it takes away from the novels for me.",The Dark Tower
821,worldweb,More disappointing than expected.,1,1 December 2017,"Maybe someday someone will actually make a movie or a series that captures the story as told in the books, and keep King's personal politics out. Until then, all this has done is degrade the brand severely.A fine job was done on Lord of the Rings and that quality and attention to detail is what is needed for the Dark Tower stories, which King fancies as his version of the Tolkien classic.This movie only escapes complete oblivion because of the high quality talent led by Idris Elba and Matthew McConaughey, but alas, this is not enough for those who travelled the long journey with the original Roland, by book.",The Dark Tower
822,rrboelter,Ishtar with gun play....A great epic squandered,2,2 December 2017,"There have been some truly great adaptations of Stephen King stories: The Green Mile, The Shawshank Redemption, Stand by Me, Misery and the Shining. Unfortunately, this movie is not one of them. Instead, it could be the worst adaptation of what many regard as King's masterpiece. The film had a lot going for it: two incredibly talented actors, great source material and a 60 million dollar budget. The word squandered comes to mind. At one point watching the film, i realized the Dark Tower reminded me of the 1987 famous Hollywood flop ""Ishtar"" but with gun play. Like the Dark Tower, it also starred two great actors and had them slogging their way through a hot mess of a plot. The story line is simply a dumbed down string of crudely adapted scenes lifted from various Dark Tower books and thrown together with gunfire and explosions mixed in. The characters have been so overly simplified that they are cartoonish at best. The thing that most disappointing about this motion picture was the fact that both Idris Elba and Matthew McConaughey could have been working on other worthwhile projects rather than this debacle. If you enjoyed this movie...you really must treat yourself and read the books. The first book, ""The Gunslinger"" is a very short book and is a super fast read. If you've already read the books...don't waste your time with the movie..you will simply be left with a sense of frustration. The November 2017 release of The Dark Tower was appropriate...this film is a turkey and was about as pleasant to experience as a full Thanksgiving dinner made into a smoothie.",The Dark Tower
823,meannex,Will only make sense if you've read the books,4,16 December 2017,"Let me start by saying I haven't read the books (didn't even know that was an adaptation nor from whom), hadn't watch the trailers nor read any summaries. So basically, I guess you could say I was as unbiais as one can be as I knew or expected absolutely nothing from this movie. Just thought the title was kinda cool.
Well... First of all, I didn't care much for the acting. The kid isn't so bad (except for the scene when he learns his mom's dead, that was bad acting) but I really felt like Alba and McConaughey were trying too hard. But the worst for me is that I've reached the end thinking: are you kidding? that's how it ends? we've learnt absolutely nothing at all about the universe! Who is the Man in Black, why is he so powerful, is he one of a kind (and why? how?), what did he wanted and why?? Who/what are the ""fake skins"" exactly? Why are they under the MiB's orders? What was the world at the very start of the movie (like what's up with the bracelets and the alarm and so on?). Where did the gunslingers come from? Why are they different? Are there gunslingers on any worlds or just this one and why? Why the gunslinger's world is dying and not keystone earth? Why, why WHY? That's where this movie is failing BIG TIME in my opinion. What kind of movie is it when you HAVE to have read the books to make sense of it? A movie is supposed to stand on its own. I don't care if it's supposed to be a new franchise, if things will make sense in the next (hypothetical) movies. At the very least the first movie has to make sense to every viewers. I'm not even saying that the non-book-readers should be able to like it, but really just be able to understand what the f** is going on. That's a shame because we can almost feel like there is some potential to this universe... but oh my was the story telling bad. No chance I will come back for more!",The Dark Tower

I'd like to invite all the people who made this movie to my house, which is something definitely impossible, but it's alright, and I'd like to kiss them all :) Literally. This movie I believe is the best movie after the Matrix. You even can consider this as a sequel. If you buy a DVD of it, I guarantee that you won't be able to miss any second. The average rate on IMDB is totally irrelevant. Probably it's a troll business. Sorry for IMDB. There is an interesting current flowing from Denmark I should say. The Neon Demon which has been directed by Nicolas Winding Refn, who also have directed Only God Forgives, and now this Nicolaj Arcel are the people should be protected and encouraged to make more movies. They are writing a bible of truth. They are so direct and unbelievable determent people. I'd like to give special thanks to Idris Elba and Matthew McConaughey to be in this movie. You got balls sir! I cannot say I'm a big fan of Steve Kohen! Cell, starring John Cusack and Samuel Jackson, was the last movie based on his novel I just watched few days ago on DVD, and it was a cheaper movie I should say, and at the end you're being disappointed, because it has no happy ending, but these 2 movies can be seen as relatives. I admire Steve because he's a very very strong Arra! And of course very big credit to Akiva Goldsman. If I could meet him I'd be asking the meaning of his name. Sounds so Japanese, but also you can say it sounds Turkish, which is not surprising for me, Akhava, can be understood as good weather or clear atmosphere. Anyway, if we need to turn to the average rating of this movie, people don't like to see themselves as they are in sharp mirrors, when they see something real about their life, if this is disturbing, they immediately deny the truth. That's why most of the people see things around them happening which they don't like to believe those are real. Reality should be reconsidered my friends.

This movie was as true to the Dark Tower books as I, Robot was to Asimov's books. Essentially, this is how I see the planning for this movie going: ""What do we ABSOLUTELY NEED to retain from the books? The Gunslinger, the kid, the man in black, the breakers - but we're pretty much going to gut that content, the Taheen, the Dixie Pig, the house in Dutch Hill. Oh yeah, and the tower. We can just ditch everything else. Okay, find me someone to write a story around that stuff, with a vague nod in the general direction of the books.""
They managed to make the Harry Potter books into individual movies; why did they feel like they had to squeeze the entire Dark Tower series into 95 minutes? In the entire history of bad Stephen King adaptations, this is the worst, and I wish I could sue the movie studio to get my time back and erase this travesty from my memory.",The Dark Tower

The many characters left out was wrong. The main character did a good job but he is not Roland. He is the opposite of Roland from the books in so many ways. So disappointed.

830,parkinsonjamie,Lazy and dull beyond belief.,1,21 February 2018,"Having read and thoroughly enjoyed the Dark Tower series of novels, I was looking forward to seeing it transition to film. Idris Elba and Matthew McConaughey should have been an absolute dream ticket for an expansive series of movies based on the book. Should have been. And then the screenwriters and director got to work on King's magnum opus. Phenomenally intelligent writing was clearly too much to cope with so the book was placed on the block and butchered. A hack here, a hack there and before long all that's left is a Hackneyed skeleton of what was there before. You can almost imagine the production meetings:Set in a future world? Nah, let's make it a parallel universe and have the gunslinger jump back and forth through a Stargate. Erm, no, not a stargate a portal. Or something. Hints of a supernatural force directing the fabric of the universe? Nah, let's just put some kids in a machine and fire their brains at a pan-dimensional tower. With lasers. Should we include the Billy-Bumbler? Are you kidding? Do you have any idea how much the CGI would cost? Forget it, just put a kid in there and maybe we'll let him have a cat or something. And so on. What resulted is a shallow, cliche-ridden hulk of a once majestic literary ship. I tried to enjoy it but after ten minutes I was no longer watching the movie, I was reaching for my laptop to do some work instead. 20 minutes in and I just switched the TV off. I'd like to comment on what happened after the bit where Elba is shooting people in a farm but I can't. I didn't see it because by that point I had had enough.",The Dark Tower

Did he not see the big flatline?
McConaughey could've worked too, but.. when all is hollowed out, what conquest is left to be made.. There is no Darkness, no White here..We're left to watch a cheap, commercial flimsy pumped up with some action. Nothing but another typical hollow, hollywood cliche production.

Whoever wrote the script just took a few elements they liked from the book and recreated the story. Less then halfway through the movie I wanted to shut it down but decided to watch it hoping that as bad as it was at not following the book it might still be a decent movie, wrong again.

It works perfectly as a stand-alone movie, the story is told in a very straight way, there are no superfluous sub-plots, no time is wasted.

835,TBMEguy,So bad I had to write a review,1,17 October 2017,"I generally don't write reviews because there are enough opinions on the internet. However, this movie is so bad that I felt there needed to more negative feedback.I am huge fan of Stephen King and the Dark Tower series. I did know going into to this movie that it was going to be an interpretation of the series as a whole and not a dramatic retelling of the actually story (which would be awesome if Hollywood didn't always try and put their tacky spin on everything). Without going into details, my high level feedback in 5 points would be:1) The pacing was awful - I am a big Dark Tower geek and I was constantly lost. 2) The story was so rushed they barely explained anything. Unless you read the book series (which my wife had not), you would be completely lost as to what is going on. 3) The characters were awful - McConaughey was the worst. I never imagined the man in black to be such a dick. He had a better sense of humour and overall swagger in the books. Plus the book had so many interesting and deep characters. We ended up seeing a bunch of minor ones in the movie that were bastardized versions at best. 4) Roland's father had a brief cameo in the movie and he was portrayed as a total wiener. Get serious Arcel and read the books, his father was not perfect, but was revered and deserved a far better portrayal than this. 5) The plot - the book series was a long arduous journey of self discovery and savings the infinite number of universes from being swallowed by the prim. This movie was your typical Hollywood 90 minute adventure about stopping the man in black from.... I still don't know what... Destroying a tower that they barely explained the meaning of? Poor form Arcel.I gave it one of my worst ratings (of the 2,063 feature length films i have watched to date), which hurts since I loved the books so much.

837,roshambo-96769,Absolutely horrible,1,16 April 2018,The actors did a great job mind you and it was directed pretty well but the story/script was atrocious. I can accept that it apparently happened in a different dimensional universe and the story would be a bit different. I was blown away when they said they would put books 1-3 in such a short timed film compared to other works of Kings. Not only did they take things all the way from books 5-6 but the story barely even loosely followed the story of the books. It had some of the same characters and thats about it. They left out 2 of the main characters which to me made no sense and changed parts of the backstory so that it isnt even remotely fitting to the series. The movie itself if I had never read the books was also just total garbage. It seemed super rushed and forced to get to the end of the film. There was extremely little suspension throughout the entire movie and I would never watch it again. Im going to just go back and re-read the series because this movie crushed my soul a little bit and I need to reinstate the magic that Stephen King created so long ago.,The Dark Tower
838,dillbellpal,Would give a 0/10 if possible.,1,26 April 2018,"I have just returned back from abroad, the sun was shining and I've had a brilliant time. I came back to a somewhat sunny England which was also a pleasant surprise as it's usually rainy over here so I had good thoughts for the day ahead: I had a spliff and feeling happy as Lenny I decided to whack on a film at my friends house, you know as you do. He had sky movies which was also a treat as I'm usually stuck with Netflix. After watching a few trailers and is being indecisive I stumbled across the trailer for this movie, The Dark Tower. Not going to lie the trailer looked absolutely amazing and the perfect mixture of action and special effects as well as having such big actors involved. I mean the film was dated 4.5/5 on Sky so you can't argue with that! The movie started with a kid having dreams of a dark tower, this kid I hadn't even seen in the trailer so I gave it time as you can't judge a film instantly. I have never been one to do that. I wish I had turned it off when I had my doubts. This film was the definition of schizophrenic, it had no stablility to it what so ever. One minute it's a kid who's having these dreams and the next it's a whole seperate movie almost of a gunslinger. I felt like I was going insane and I couldn't even keep focus on where I was without the movie or if there was going to be a twist where the kid was insane and it was all in his head. It turns out the kid wasn't insane, he may as well have been as the movie itself screamed insanity.Yeah, you can have movies where you can involve mystic beings, magic powers and dark forces and all that stuff. There's plenty of films I have enjoyed that are like that but when you combine this with such a poorly put together film with two seperate ends of the spectrum combined in to one it just becomes an absolute heap of ****. Nothing made sense and it seemed almost like there was two movies that where put together in to one, I didn't know how to feel, in fact I felt just as insane as the kid trying to decifer what on earth was going on. I'm fed up of films like this even being made, nowadays it seems there's more and more and it pisses me off. How on earth anyone can watch this film and not feel like getting Friendly with a rope and stool is beyond me. I literally feel like I can't watch a movie again, I mean how could I... how can I trust films anymore. First Geostorm and now this absolute disaster, I'm fuming! I wanted to throw the TV out the window after watching this, I didn't even want another spliff I just wanted to go for a walk in to the moors and never come back.Over all, more tragic than what is going on in Syria at this moment in time, that 60 million dollars budget on this film could have been used to save people's lives and instead it was spent on making this. I give up completely, if you are reading this review don't even bother watching this. Instead go and buy yourself a hammer and knock your teeth out because I can give my personal assurance that you'll be less disappointed and hurt from that.

839,chrisewelke,Worst SK/screenplay ever,1,29 April 2018,"Next to Cerberus the Aardvark, TDT is my favorite epic of all time. Hence I expected the film to pale up against a story that unites every tale ever penned by King (The Gunslinger also being his first story). With the title, it was clear Hollywood would shoehorn ""drawing"" ""wastelands"" and possibly even ""wizard"" cuz who would watch a flick about Roland chasing Walter around a desert and sending Jake to his death to fulfill a selfish (?) desire? For pseudo fidelity, a 13 part Netflix series would at least partially explore the themes and characters. Why the cheese ball Sfx and weird future-base of the man in Black? Why did they cast Mcaunehey (?) NO one pictures him as a bad guy, let alone an epic megalomaniac. Same for Elba. King wrote that Roland is ""based on 70s era Dirty Harry."" Gossip rags suggested Javier Bardem to play The Gunslinger... evil, calculating, intense, hell bent on getting the job done at any cost. His Assassin in ""no country"" is as close to the ""real, modern Roland"" as I've ever seen. Was Elba cheaper? Bardem averse to playing an anti hero? On that note Jake is too old. The setting looks like Burbank, the plot convoluted... and repeating gunslinger mantras to overkill diminishes their meaning. I bought this flick sight unseen being a super fan of TDT, I've read all seven countless times including ""the wind/keyhole"" My greatest fear realized: TDT movie is trite, truncated, out of set, setting, continuity and character.

847,atmiller_artist,"The Dark Tower was only ever a MacGuffin, say sorry...",8,6 December 2018,"Like the multifaceted nature of the Tower itself, this movie is what many fellow reviewers of differing opinions are describing all at once; some saying it is more loosely derivative of a boiled down, condensed version of the epic series from which it was derived rather than a faithful screen adaptation of the original, and others calling it a solid stand-alone movie. It is my understanding that Sai King had at least creative input, i.e. advice, to give, but was countermanded in a few key areas such as Roland wearing a hat.I enjoyed the movie for what it is, an action film with familiar elements. I was disappointed, however, with all the creative license taken by the film-makers as well as that they drew from so many parts from across the series rather than focusing on the events in only the first book. In the sequel, Roland and Jake have solved that whole pesky Tower-being-destroyed-by-ultimate-evil-issue neatly, and are now wandering merchants selling 'Astin' and other Key-Earth goods to the Mid-world masses. At least that's my guess, since the original story has been skewed enough that returning to it now would be to dismiss this movie in nearly its entirely.Roland's desire to get to the Dark Tower throughout sai King's epic heptalogy (or octalogy if you count the latest installment) was a literary tool used to create dynamic tension, a way to keep pressure on the characters so that their lives were rife with drama. Once reached, King reduced the importance of that pinnacle moment in Roland's many adventures to what felt to me an afterthought. The tower was less a place of actual universal importance and more an example of perception as reality. Gan's Navel turned out to be full of rooms showcasing moments in his own life. Even the battle with the Crimson King, while written in King's beautiful style, felt a bit tacked on; as though he did not really want to write it but felt obligated.Sai King points out that this movie, while derived from the books, is to be considered a sequel, as if obtaining the Horn of Eld had such a radical impact on events that they shifted into what is offered on the silver screen. Others have also suggested that it may help die-hard tower fans to picture this movie occurring as an echo of the original adventure on another level of the tower.Idris playing the Gunslinger was a bit of a stretch for me. He has Roland's gruff spirit, but, despite King stating that he doesn't really ""see"" a character as he's writing unless they walk in front of a mirror, Roland was described by numerous people in the book, and one of the most accurate--at least to my imagination--was part Native American, part Caucasian. It would have been cool to see him played by someone of similar lineage.",The Dark Tower

How involved this story is and the nuances that make it work in written format do not translate well to a short film. Characters are changed so they fit the format meaning their all important arcs are missing leaving them empty. The plot is jumpy and full of holes which the viewer can feel.
