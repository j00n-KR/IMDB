0,MartinHafer,At least Van Damme is the real deal.,8,27 May 2019,"When it debuted, ""Bloodsport"" was to have been a story of the famed martial artist and miltary hero, Frank Dux. According to Dux, he won the ultra-secret 'Kumite'...a no holds barred martial arts international competition. He also was a top secret operative for the military and went on all sorts of scary missions in various countries. Unfortunately, pretty much none of Dux's claims turned out to be true! However, I assume no one other than Dux knew it at the time AND the star of ""Bloodsport"", Jean-Claude Van Damme, was no phony--having been a very accomplished full-contact fighter with championships to his credit. So, while the story turns out to be a load of crap, you cannot fault Van Damme and it's among his best films.The lead up to Dux (Van Damme) going to the Kumite is confusing....like two separate movies tossed together. One shows him running away from the army to fight in the competition. Another shows him working for years with his Master to get ready for the competition! This was confusing and the chronology made no sense.Once the film heads overseas to the Kumite, things improve considerably. Dux strikes up a friendship with a nice but dopey lug who is also in the Kumite (Donald Gibb). Ultimately, an insanely sociopathic competitor unleashes EVERYTHING on the lug and leaves him a battered mess. And, ultimately, Dux must also fight this Chong Li. Is such an ignominious ending also in store for Dux as well?While I am not a huge fan of the Van Damme films, he did make some good ones and his martial arts skills are truly amazing. If you watch ""Bloodsport"", you'll see what I mean. Van Damme is a very impressive athlete instead of just being some actor....and his athletic skills are far superior to his acting skills. Seeing his splits and many of the action scenes leave you breathless!So is the film itself any good? After all, we know now that nobody (other than Dux) believes the story to be true. Well, despite the spotty background to Dux and the film, it is a very good film for the genre. Like many 80s films, it has montages, 80s pop music, slow-motion and all the standard cliches...but it does them all so well and Van Damme is so good in the story. Overall, a surprisingly good film that holds up well today.",Bloodsport
1,Leofwine_draca,Van Damme's breakout role is an average low budget action flick,6,5 December 2015,"This title holds the dubious distinction of being the first film that really showcased Jean Claude Van Damme's martial arts. Throughout the film, we are constantly invited to watch Van Damme kick people in the face, spin around and generally do other athletic things, so this can be considered as the first film that broke him into Hollywood. As a film itself, the premise is rather basic and descends into a series of staged fight scenesthe familiarity of the situation comes from the many other films that Van Damme made which were basically just remakes of this one (I'm talking stuff like A.W.O.L., THE QUEST, KICKBOXER, etc.). The low budget is apparent, in that we don't get much in the way of special effects, but the fight scenes are all pretty good. All of these fights looked authentic (apart from the first, I think, where the thrown punches and kicks were too obvious) and kept the attention.The acting isn't really important in a film like this, but stillthe female lead is, as to be expected, an airhead, adding nothing to the film whatsoever. Van Damme was still struggling with his accent at this point in time and he lacks some of the natural charisma which he later conveyed. Yes, his acting wasn't as good here, but he makes an adequate leading man and he's never been in better physical shape. Bolo Yeung thoroughly enjoys himself in the sneering role of the lead villain, and he obviously enjoyed working with Van Damme as he later turned up in 1991's DOUBLE IMPACT, playing yet another villain. It's surprising to see a young Forest Whitaker in the cast (this was obviously before he went ""legit""), in the pointless role of a government agent whose job is to get Van Damme back to America. These scenes are added in as mere padding, to add something to the film other than the fight sequences, and consequently fall flat.The violence level is high, with lots of kicking and punching. We get some broken arms and legs, and plenty of nosebleeds, but I was surprised that the film didn't add more in the way of gratuitous violencethe only actual violence which hit home were the bits involving Yeung. On an simple level, this film is enjoyable, but it lacks the polished veneer and style of Van Damme's later offerings and therefore can't be considered one of his best.",Bloodsport
2,SnoopyStyle,hello Van Damme,7,3 May 2016,"Fighters from around the world are gathering in Hong Kong to compete in the full contact Kumite tournament. U.S. Army Captain Frank Dux (Jean-Claude Van Damme) is going. After Senzo Tanaka's son Shingo's death, Frank was trained to take over the Tanaka legacy. He goes AWOL and the Army sends officers Helmer and Rawlins (Forest Whitaker) to retrieve him. Looming over everyone is the brutal Kumite champion Chong Li.The setup is banal. The acting is mostly poor to utterly embarrassing. None of that matters because the matches are so fun. The UFC would arrive years later. Van Damme's acting is horrible but his kicks are things of beauty. It's my first introduction to his splits and I was amazed. It's a simple movie with simple pleasures for the simple parts of my brain.",Bloodsport
3,claudio_carvalho,One of the Best Van Damme´s Films,7,13 February 2018,"The military Frank Dux (Jean Claude Van Damme) abandons his base to participate in the Kumite, a dangerous secret competition in Hong Kong. Before embarking in the airplane, Frank visits his martial arts trainer Senzo Tanaka (Roy Chiao), who is terminal, and promises to win the tournament to honor him. Frank travels to Hong Kong and befriends the fighter Ray Jackson (Donald Gibb) that is lodged in the same hotel and has a love affair with the journalist Janice Kent (Leah Ayres). However the American officers Helmer (Norman Burton) and Rawlins (Forest Whitaker) chase him to bring home back to the base without injuries. Meanwhile Frank and the dirty Japanese fighter Chong Li (Bolo Yeung), who won the last Kumite, are winning their fights and coming to the ultimate fight. 
 ""Bloodsport"" is an early Van Damme´s film and also one of his best films ever, disclosing the refuted story of the American martial artist Frank Dux. The screenplay is funny and engaging with excellent fight choreography. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""O Grande Dragão Branco"" (""The Great White Dragon"")",Bloodsport
4,gavin6942,Fun 1980s Action Film,7,22 December 2014,"Frank Dux (Jean Claude VanDamme) has spent most his life being trained by Tanaka to participate in the Kumite, the ultimate martial arts tournament, where participants are seriously injured, even killed.From a critical standpoint, this film gets sort of a bad rap because of the cheesy acting and formulaic plot. Some people might even give it a hard time because it alleges to be based on a true story which was (not surprisingly) found to be a figment of one man's imagination.But is there not a certain level of nostalgia for 1980s action films? The violence, the hair, the gratuitous romance (which is really forced here). No decade before or since has mastered the action film. 80s horror is amazing, but the action films were really the pinnacle, thanks in no small part to Cannon.",Bloodsport
5,jboothmillard,Bloodsport,3,11 August 2021,"I think it was an American I got to know a little that told me this was their favourite film of all time, I found it was one of the earliest leading roles for the star, it has become a cult film and spawned a few sequels, and I gave it a go. Basically, U. S. Army Captain Frank Dux (Jean-Claude Van Damme) has trained in the ways of ninjutsu under his sensei Senzo Tanaka (Roy Chiao). Senzo was impressed with Frank's integrity and toughness as a child, and decided to train him alongside his son, Shingo (Sean Ward). After Shingo's death, Senzo trains Dux as a member of the Tanaka clan. Dux is invited to the Kumite, an illegal martial arts tournament in Hong Kong. After his Army superiors refuse to let him go, Dux deserts, saying goodbye to his sensei. Criminal Investigation Command officers Helmer (Norman Burton) and Rawlins (Forest Whitaker) travel to Hong Kong, assigned to track down and arrest Dux. After arriving in Hong Kong, Dux befriends American fighter Ray Jackson (Donald Gibb) and their guide Victor Lin (Ken Siu). When they arrive at the Kumite arena, the officials are sceptical, but Dux proves his worth performing the Dim Mak death touch, breaking the bottom of a pile of bricks. On the first day of the tournament, Dux makes an enemy of ruthless Kumite champion Chong Li (Bolo Yeung) after breaking his record for the fastest knockout. Dux becomes involved with American journalist Janice Kent (Leah Ayres), who is investigating the Kumite. Although Dux refuses to help her, she sneaks into the arena going on a date with another spectator. On the second day, Jackson is matched against Chong Li. Jackson comes close to defeating Li, but he wastes time gloating, allowing Li to recover and viciously beat him. Jackson is hospitalised and Dux visiting him vows to avenge him. After witnessing the brutality of the tournament, Janice and Dux argue as she tries to convince him not to return. Dux tells her that he has to win in order to become the best he can be. Helmer and Rawlins catch up to Dux in Hong Kong and a chase ensues through the downtown area, but Dux evades them when they fall into a canal. Later at the Kumite, he finds local police are waiting for him. He eludes them as well but agrees to return with Helmer and Rawlins after the tournament. On the final day, Li kills his opponent, much to the dismay of the crowd. Fearing defeat, Li conceals a salt pill in his waistband before the final match against Dux. When Dux gains the upper hand, Li blinds him by crushing the pill and throwing it into Dux's face. Blinded by the salt, Dux relies on his blindfolded training from Tanaka, overcoming the handicap and defeating Li. The following day, he bids farewell to Janice and Jackson before returning to the United States with Helmer and Rawlins. Also starring Rani Gill as Special Lady, Philip Chan as Captain Chen, Pierre Rafini as Young Frank and Shun-Yin Leung as Mrs. Tanaka. Van Damme early in his career is not that convincing, Yeung is sinister at times, Gibb is a likeable supporting character, and seeing Whitaker in early supporting role is interesting. The story is loosely based on a true story, but to be honest, it is all about the fights, full of high kicks and violence, the script is full of predictable stuff and is pretty uninteresting, a slightly pointless martial arts action. Adequate!",Bloodsport
6,ma-cortes,Exciting kick-boxing movie in which Van Damme endeavors to win a deadly and outlaw competition called Kumite celebrated in Hong Kong,6,27 May 2013,"This is one of the best Van Damme movies with overwhelming combats and spectacular scenes . The picture displays lots of violence, action filled, thrills and fierce combats. The breathtaking fights are magnificently choreographed . It deals with Frank Dux (Jean Claude Van Dame, at the time being a world-championship martial artist in his own right) has spent most his life being trained by Tanaka (Roy Chao) to participate in the Kumite, the ultimate martial arts tournament . Frank learns about a sacred-fighting and martial arts from a Chinese wise man . Frank decides to go to Hong Kong , despite being banned by his superiors in the army that he can't because they need him ; however Frank flees and two officers (Norman Burton , Forest Whitaker) are sent to get him and the way leads to Hong Kong . There being also pursued by the officials but Frank eludes them . In Hong Kong takes place the secret contest where the world's greatest warriors fight in a battle to the death . And naturally , once Frank manages to get into the competition , his opponents are defeated . Frank befriends a tough and bouncing contestant (Donald Gibb) and falls in love with a journalist (Leah Ayres) . He must avenge the almost death of his friend and regain the Kumite prize . The movie is based on a book by Frank Dux and was touted as a true story. However, since then much doubt has arisen about the veracity of Dux's story and now the majority of martial-arts enthusiasts view his accounts of competing in secret tournaments as complete fiction, as well as his claims of military service and being an undercover CIA operative. Some have pointed out that he is the only source that these secret tournaments exist, and that nobody else has come forward to confirm his story or ell their own version.Entertaining film plenty of kick-boxing action , Full Contact and the sound of bones cracking . This is a colourful, Hong Kong set and enough budget movie ; leave no cliché untouched , though the fighting are well staged . Being based upon true events in the life of Frank Dux who founded the first American Ninjitsu system . The real Frank Dux was the fighting coordinator for this movie , when Jean-Claude Van Damme was cast, Dux announced that Van Damme wasn't nearly in good enough shape, and put him through a 3-month training program. Van Damme called those three months ""the hardest training of his life"". Though Frank Dux's brick-breaking demonstration is purely fictional, the ""Death Touch"" is a legendary move fabled in Chinese martial arts folklore ; it is an accu-pressure attack where the attacker quickly strikes his opponent several times at various spots on his body. Striking an opponent in this method can result in broken bones, paralysis/painful muscle spasms or even instant death . Bolo Yeung is magnificent as a sadistic fighter ; the majority of Bolo Yeung's lines are similar to Bruce Lee's in ¨Enter the Dragon¨, in which Bolo appeared . Catching musical score composed in the 80s style and made by means synthesizer . The motion picture was professionally directed by Newton Arnold ; however , even after it was filmed, the movie was almost never released, but Jean-Claude Van Damme helped edit the film so that it could be . The result is a strong entry for action buffs, though strictly for Jean Claude Van Damme fans . Followed by two sequels : ¨Bloodsport 2¨ The next Kumite¨(1995) by Alan Meherez with Daniel Bernhardt , Pat Morita and James Hong and ¨Bloodsport 3¨ with Daniel Berhhart , John Rhys Davies and James Hong .",Bloodsport
7,paul_haakonsen,Late 1980s classic martial arts movie...,7,25 January 2021,"Well, the 1988 ""Bloodsport"" movie has always been one of my favorites, even since it came out and I was 13 years old. And I have revisited the movie a couple of times over the years since then, and the movie still keeps to be as entertaining as it was back then.Sure, the storyline told in ""Bloodsport"", as written by Sheldon Lettich, Christopher Cosby and Mel Friedman is pretty cheesy and campy. But that is part of the charm of the movie actually. It is a very predictable movie, of course, especially given the simplicity of the storyline. But it is the action that carries the movie, no doubt about it. And that action still holds up in 2021.The acting in ""Bloodsport"" is fairly shoddy, from most people involved in the movie. I mean, even Jean Claude Van Damme, the lead actor in the movie, he is not putting on a particularly convincing performance with his acting - though luckily, he has improved on his acting skills over the years. But his fighting, his dexterity and on-screen charisma makes it worthwhile and takes away focus from the inadequate acting performance.And needless to say the fact that the movie takes place in Hong Kong is also a great appeal to me.If you look at the action sequences and the various performers here, then there were actually a good handful of rather interesting fighters and martial arts performers in the movie. Lots of different styles being pitched against each other, and that is what works so well for the movie.The movie also have an interesting assembly of actors, which includes the likes of Jean Claude Van Damme, Forest Whitaker, Roy Chiao, Philip Chan, Donald Gibb and Bolo Yeung. I must say that Bolo Yeung is really so perfectly cast for the villain in the movie, and his performance is also rather memorable.""Bloodsport"" is one of those iconic and memorable action movies that managed to stand out in the late 1980s, and the movie that put Jean Claude Van Damme on the map for me.I am rating this martial arts classic a well-deserved seven out of ten stars, as it is truly an entertaining movie, and one that has withstood the test of time quite well.",Bloodsport
8,BandSAboutMovies,AWESOME...,8,10 July 2019,"Jean-Claude Van Damme - the Muscles from Brussels - first appeared in a film in 1979, where he had an uncredited role in André Delvaux's Woman Between Wolf and Dog. After moving to the United States with his childhood friend Michel Qissi, who plays Suan Paredes in this film and would go on to appear in several JCVD movies. Their first appearance was in Breakin', which has gone on to be a memorable meme.After becoming a friend and sparring partner with Chuck Norris - he even bounced at the action hero's bar Woody's Wharf - Van Damme would go on to be part of the stunt team for Missing In Action. Then, he achieved a sizeable role in No Retreat, No Surrender, playing the Russian bad guy Ivan Kraschinsky that Kurt McKinney must train - with the ghost of Bruce Lee no less - to defeat.After an abortive attempt at playing the lead villain in Predator, it was time for Van Damme to star in his own film. Bloodsport - based on the maybe real life of Frank Dux - would be that movie, making $65 million on a $2.3 million dollar budget.U.S. Army Captain Frank Dux (Van Damme) once trained in the ways of ninja under sensei Senzo Tanaka (Roy Chiao, who appeared in Game of Death, Enter the Dragon and Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom) after he tried to steal a katana from the master as a child. he was trained alongside Senzo's son Shingo, who has died in a martial arts tournament. Frank goes AWOL to be part of the Kumite, an illegal martial arts battle to the death, for revenge.That puts Rawlins (Forest Whitaker) and Helmer (Norman Burton, who played Felix Leiter in Diamonds Are Forever and the boss in Fade to Black), two Criminal Investigation Command officers, on his trail.Once Dux makes it to Hong Kong, he becomes fast friends with American fighter Ray Jackson (Donald Gibb, Ogre from Revenge of the Nerds), which is good, because they're the only gaijin in this tournament. However, once they learn Dux represents the Tanaka clan and how he has the""death touch"" - and Jackson breaks bricks with his forehead - they're accepted.After several rounds of awesome fights - this movie is pretty much all fights, making it one of the most fun movies ever made - Frank, Ray and the evil champion Chong Li (Bolo Yeung) remain. Li hates Frank for beating his fastest knockout record, but our hero is more interested in Janice Kent, a reporter.During day two, Ray has Chong beat, but pauses to do his taunt move and gets his butt handed to him, landing in the hospital. Dux vows to get revenge for his friend, but his new lady, who he has only known 24 hours, argues that he should just leave. This woman will never understand Kumite!The police and officers chase and catch Frank, who agrees to go back if he can finish the final battle. Chong kills his opponent and the crowd turns on him. They hate him even more when he cheats, throwing a pill packed with dust into Frank's eyes. Frank rises above all that nonsense and wins, sparing the life of his enemy while getting revenge.So how true is Bloodsport? According to Sheldon Lettich, who wrote the film, told Asian Movie Pulse:""I had known Frank Dux for a number of months before I came up with the idea for Bloodsport. Frank told me a lot of tall tales, most of which turned out to be BS."" One of those tall tales were about his military history: ""Frank also used to tell me, and just about everyone he spoke to, that he had participated in secret missions for the C.I.A. and the U.S. military, and that he had won the Medal Of Honor for his heroism. He even showed me the Medal, which he had supposedly been awarded by the President. Years afterwards, when numerous people began questioning his stories, he stopped claiming that he won the Medal, and then began claiming that he'd never told anyone he won it.""That said, somewhere in all those stories, there was the idea for a movie. And Dux had a backup that could prove he had actually been in a Kumite tournament: ""There was one guy who he introduced me to, named Richard Bender, who claimed to have actually been at the Kumite event and who swore everything Frank told me was true. A few years later this guy had a falling-out with Frank, and confessed to me that everything he told me about the Kumite was a lie; Frank had coached him in what to say.""Another article in the LA Times takes the story even further, showing how Dux claimed that a rival ninja teacher was conspiring against him and that he'd been reinventing his past for decades. I've also read on Pro MMA Now that if you do the math, for Frank Dux to win 56 consecutive knockouts in a row in one tournament would mean that 72 quadrillion fighters were in it. That's only around ten times more people that are alive right now.Whether or not this movie is based on a true story, Van Damme does seven splits in it. It also features an eleven minute-long flashback, which kind of tests the limits of just how long a flashback could, should and can be. And any movie where JCVD makes this face is a winner in my book.",Bloodsport
9,hitchcockthelegend,"You told me to use any tactic that works, never to commit yourself to one style, to keep an open mind!",7,20 July 2019,"Bloodsport is directed by Newt Arnold and written by Christopher Cosby, Mel Friedman and Sheldon Lettich. It stars Jean-Claude Van Damme, Donald Gibb, Leah Ayres, Norman Burton, Forest Whitaker and Bolo Yeung. Music is by Paul Hertzog and cinematography by David Worth.One of the earlier films that made Van Damme into a star, Bloodsport finds Van Damme as real life martial artist Frank Dux. Dux enters into the famed Kumite, a no nonsense tournament in Hong Kong and must overcome various hurdles to hopefully achieve his goals.As is the norm for a Van Damme action movie, particularly where his late 80s and early 90s output is concerned, one has to be prepared for some at best average acting and a flimsy plot. Plot follows a familiar Van Damme trajectory, his character will yearn to overcome adversity, go through a strenuous training programme, meet and make friends and enemies, produce some outstanding martial artistry, and end up in a winner takes all fight for justice, revenge, honour...Away from the seriously great fighting skills showcased by Van Damme and the other martial artists he comes up against, there's not a lot of artistic film making craft on show. But as fans of this sort of stuff will tell you, and I'm one of that number, it matters not, for they deliver exactly what we expect. Great fight choreography, a super Kumite montage, a vile villain who needs his ass kicked, and of course lots of Van Damage as we hurtle towards what we hope will be a triumphant finale. Hooray!Though supposedly based on facts in Frank Dux's life, this has been called into question over the years, so best to just observe it as an energised martial arts film rather than a part biography piece. 7/10",Bloodsport
10,Scarecrow-88,Bloodsport,7,21 December 2009,"The Kumite was an underground full contact sport where fighters of all varieties of skills and backgrounds, from all over the world, come together and compete to crown a heavyweight champion. The uniqueness of this tournament is that there are few to no rules, except that you can be a winner in three basic ways..throw your opponent from the platform, knock your opponent out, or make him submit. What can normally happen, however, is severe damage to the human anatomy or, quite possibly, death. That is what makes the current champ so lethal, he has no qualms finishing off his opposition, in fact, he seems to purposely go out of his way to injure and kill. This champ is Chong Li and he holds the record for fastest victory on the platform. He just might've met his match in American Frank Dux, representing his ""shidoshi"", the Tanaka family, having been taught/trained by him since he was a kid. Having escaped from a military base, agents are sent to Hong Kong, where the Kumite tourney is being held, to recapture Dux, who, come hell or high water, will compete and win in the honor of his dying ""father"".With Leah Ayers(The Burning)as a reporter who falls head over heels for Dux, Forest Whitaker and Norman Burton assigned to bring Dux back to America, and Roy Chiao as Tanaka, Dux' mentor and fatherly figure. ""Bloodsport"" was part of Van Damme's ""glory period"" where he become a popular fixture in action movies many of us watched as kids(..many of us are now in our 30's and 40's when we grew up with these movies that run successfully on cable providing us with ample opportunity to catch them on time and again).While it'd be easy to take shots at his abilities as an actor, when it comes to the physical work performed in the movie, I think he more than holds his own. To have Bolo Yeung as Chong Li is of major importance because I remember being quite spooked by his immense presence on screen, how intimidating he looks when he'd send off that cold, confident stare towards those in his trajectory.There were those of us, when we'd talk about ""Bloodsport"" as kids, who believed that Donald Gibbs' beer-swilling, rough-housing, fist-fighting brawler, Ray Jackson, had a chance to perhaps defeat Chong Li had he remained focused on the task at hand, instead of showing off his temporary advantage over the champ..if that'd have happened, however, his next opponent was Dux, and you know that wasn't gonna happen in this movie. Gibbs' rapport with Van Damme really adds a lot to the dramatic punch to the gut(..pun intended)needed when Dux squares off with Chong Li(..the head bandanna symbolizing a victory Dux wishes to avenge).Like ""Kickboxer"", ""Bloodsport"" opens with Dux training under Tanaka, a foreigner given a chance to learn ""martial science"" under a master. Many films carry this trait in the genre, where a white man is allowed to become a great martial artist under the tutelage of an expert. Obviously, this is attractive to a western audience which is probably why so many movies were made during the later 80's/early 90's, retaining this formula. American martial artists as heroes, I see the appeal since I was a kid who these movies where successfully marketed towards.Revisiting the movie, I realized that it isn't the ""great"" movie I remembered adoring as a youth, and the fights themselves aren't that long, for the exception of the finale(..I'm guessing the fights together total maybe fifteen or so minutes of the overall film), but seeing Van Damme and Bolo Yeung at the peak of their abilities, how impressive they perform for the audience, I enjoyed their dual very much, particularly the adjustment Dux must make when blinded by cocaine. The violence can be pretty unsettling, such as the poor fighter whose leg is broken(..a bone protruding), blood spitting off from battered faces, with snapped necks and pummeled torsos. There are numerous tricks in the film(..the coin trick and the death punch which explodes the bottom brick in a pile with the others above it still intact)to establish Dux as a superhero.",Bloodsport
11,Hey_Sweden,A must for martial arts aficionados.,7,30 December 2014,"In this early starring vehicle, Jean-Claude Van Damme plays the real-life Frank W. Dux (as in, ""Put up your Dux!""). Frank's an American soldier who goes A.W.O.L. in order to travel to Hong Kong and participate in the Kumite, a brutal, full contact martial arts tournament. It's so brutal, in fact, that some who enter the contest don't make it out alive. While Frank is pursued by government agents (played by Norman Burton and Forest Whitaker) who mean to take him back to the U.S., he makes friends with amiable giant Jackson (Donald Gibb) and attempts to romance reporter Janice Kent (Leah Ayres).There isn't much in terms of story throughout this relatively brief movie (93 minutes all told), but devotees of the action genre will get what they aim to see. ""Bloodsport"" is deftly edited, adequately paced, effectively gory at times, and features enough intense fighting to make it suitable entertainment. Van Damme may not have been much of an actor at this point, but he was already displaying that easygoing charm that has served him well. Gibb, best known as Ogre in ""Revenge of the Nerds"", delivers a lively performance as his new buddy. Ms. Ayres (""The Burning"") does a decent job as the requisite romantic interest and certainly is very easy on the eyes. Burton and Whitaker are good as the government guys just trying to do their jobs; it's fun to see them attend the final matches and actually start enjoying the spectacle. Genre legend Bolo Yeung is a perfect villain as Chong Li, the reigning champion of the Kumite who's developed an enormous ego. Roy Chiao (Bruce Lee's ""Game of Death"") as Frank's mentor Tanaka and Philip Chan (""Double Impact"") as police captain Chen are excellent in support. By the time of the big confrontation / fight at the end, sufficient rooting interest has been generated.Just before the end credits, we get a summary of the accomplishments in the real Frank Dux's life.Seven out of 10.",Bloodsport
12,poolandrews,Oddly enjoyable martial arts flick.,6,21 February 2008,"Bloodsport starts in the US where marine Frank Dux (Jean-Claude Van Damme) goes AWOL & visits his old friend Tanaka (Roy Chiao) who he convinces to teach him some fancy martial arts technique including the 'Death Touch' move.

Based on true events Bloodpsort was JCVD's fifth film & his first starring role, to be honest this ain't too bad at all. The script by Christopher Cosby, Mel Friedman & Sheldon Lettich moves along at a reasonable pace & it gives the makers a fair number of chances to stage various martial arts fights which is all most viewers will be interested in I would have thought. The character's are alright if a little basic, they are fairly likable & the dialogue isn't too bad either. It tells an OK story with the minimum of fuss with some heroes & some villains & it passes 90 odd minutes harmlessly enough if all your looking for is a bit of martial arts. However it's not perfect with several underdeveloped sub plots, for instance why do the US army want Frank Dux back so badly? They send these two guy's after him who try to take him back but the script never gives any reason for it! I mean Frank is just a soldier, he's not even top level brass or anything, just a lowly soldier according to this so why is he so vital to the army & in what capacity did the army spend lots of time & money on him as suggested?Director Arnold does alright, Bloodsport isn't going to win any awards for grace or style but it looks neat and tidy enough. It has a late 80's feel to it with JCVD sporting a daft looking haircut & a few silly skin tight outfits that look like they belong in an aerobics class. The fights are surprisingly well choreographed & effective, they are clear & concise & you can easily keep track of who is who & whats going on which is nice in view of the modern blink & you will miss it editing & quick cuts style of cutting action films. Apparently even after it was finished Bloodsport was almost never released & JCVD himself stepped in to reedit it so that it could be, I would have hate to have seen the original rough cut. Most 80's action films have at least one unintentionally funny moment, here in Bloodsport there's a scene early on as Tanaka is training JCVD & makes him serve him & his wife tea blindfolded!With a supposed budget of about $1,500,000 Bloodsport is competent, it's reasonably well made with decent if unspectacular production values. Shot on location in Hong Kong which gives it a nice authentic look. Apparently paid $70,000 for his role JCVD does alright here but the boy never was, isn't & never will be a good actor. Amazingly respected Hollywood actor Forest Whitaker has a small role while Hollywood typecast Chinese martial arts film bad guy Bolo Yeung plays the bad guy.Bloodsport isn't a masterpiece, it isn't art & it won't change your life but it is a decent film with some good martial arts fights which is really all anyone came to see. Does what it says on the tin, no more no less. Successful enough to spawn three sequels Bloodsport 2 (1996), Bloodsport III (1997) & Bloodsport: The Dark Kumite (1999) none of which feature JCVD.",Bloodsport

Sure, he made a couple or three before this, but this one got him a Razzie nomination for worst new artist.

Frand Dux (Jean-Claude Van Damme) goes to the ultimate Karate match against orders. He is fighting his way up the chain to meet the defending champion; an ugly monster played by Bolo Yeung. His friend gets hurt and that spurs him on to fight harder. That's as much plot as you need. This is all about the fighting and there is plenty of it. Every weird type of karate master is in this tourney and, if you enjoy the sport, you will enjoy the movie.It also features Forest Whitaker (The Last King of Scotland) in a great follow up to his funny role in Good Morning Vietnam.",Bloodsport
14,view_and_review,Frank Dux the Phony,3,27 February 2020,"32 years ago, this movie was all that and a bag of chips. Today it looks like it's not even worth a bag of chips.What I thought was a fiction is supposedly based upon the life of a man named Frank Dux (pronounced doox, played by Jean Claude Van Damme). Then, after some cursory research I find out that Frank Dux was an effing liar.""Bloodsport"" takes place in Hong Kong. There is a full contact martial arts tournament called the Kumité that occurs there annually and only the top fighters in the world fight in it. After we see a montage of Dux being trained by a ninjitsu master who was the mean alter ego of Mr. Miyagi we see him on his way to Hong Kong for the tournament--much to the chagrin of the U.S. military. It's unknown why the military is so adamant about him not fighting in this tournament, but it looks more like an unnecessary layer of drama to make the movie more exciting. It only made the movie more foolish and unrealistic as he dodges two inept U.S. suits in Hong Kong. It was doubly galling once I read that Dux fabricated his military service record.The fighting in the movie was unconvincing by any standards. The Shaw brothers had better fight choreography in their much lower budget Chinese films in the 70's. And the slow motion shots only did more damage to the fighting façade. In slow motion you could see missed strikes that knocked guys over and fighters already reacting to strikes that have yet to hit them. Not to mention the incredibly racist portrayal of the African fighter that fought like a monkey. To even plant the seed that anybody, let alone an African, would mimic a monkey for fighting is at least imbecilic and at most patently racist.The ""fights"" were, more-or-less, pose downs with action. The well oiled and mostly muscled fighters were given ample opportunity to flex and show their physiques which happened to look a lot better than their fighting. The entire tournament was a bloodier more violent ""Karate Kid.""Of course, Frank Dux won it all. The finale was against Chong Li (played by the Chinese Hulk, Bolo Yeung). If the fighting wasn't already absurd as fighters celebrated too early or held striking poses like a basketball player after a made three-pointer, Chong Li threw some powdery substance in Dux's eyes mid fight. No one, including the referee right there, saw this infraction. So now, the already undersized Dux must fight blind as well. Not to worry though, he had ample training fighting with his eyes closed.If Frank Dux wasn't already a superstar by being the best fighter, he also got the girl. There was a token pretty skirt in the movie to fall for Frank and for him to conquer. He discovered this bold beauty in the most faux-chivalrous way. As she was being abused by her Arab armpiece he stepped in to save her. He quite literally said that whoever wins this game of mine gets the girl. After he won the sleight of hand game as though David Copperfield were his sinsei he said, ""the girl is mine"" and she happily went away with her savior. I halfway expected him to conk her over the head and drag her away as a prize after that. What was supposed to look like chivalry was more like chauvinism.Naturally, she fell for the buff Belgian. They had their fling and she was smitten. Her feminine sensitivity made her sternly remark that she would not sit and watch Frank fight and be hurt or killed in his brutish form of extracurricular activity yet, she was front and center clapping with glee without a hint of apprehension once Frank fought Chong Li.When the movie mercifully ended with Frank being the only Westerner to have won this secret fight that everyone knows about the credits rolled and said that the real Frank Dux won Kumite and set many records in the process. He had the fastest knockout at 3.2 seconds, the fastest punch with a knockout at .12 seconds, the fastest kick with a knockout at 72 mph and most consecutive knockouts in a single tournament at 56. He also had a fighting record of 329-0!!!It was at this moment that I called crap. And when I looked him up it seems like others called crap as well and did the research to prove it. When Frank lies, he lies big. To think anyone but a total sucker would believe this is hysterical.A 3.2 second knockout? It probably takes 2 seconds to even meet the opponent in the center. Did the guy fall unconscious at the sight of Frank?A punch at .12 seconds? This was late 1970's not late 2070's. How on earth do they time a punch with that degree of accuracy in a fight?A kick at 72 mph? Do they also have a radar gun at the fight pointing specifically at the fighters' legs?56 consecutive knockouts in a single tournament? What the hell tournament has 56 matches? Does the tournament last five years?And finally, 329-0? This type of dominance is unheard of in any realm. The great Charlie Zelenoff of YouTube fame never even reached 329-0. After 329 fights I'd think the law of averages would catch up to him and just maybe he accidentally lost a fight.Of course, none of this information can be verified because it was a secret fight that he just told the whole world about. The movie was already bad, but I was OK with it as long as it was fiction. Once they tried to pass it off as being real my eyes couldn't roll dramatically enough.",Bloodsport

16,FlashCallahan,why don't you quit....round eye....,9,8 January 2010,"To think that this movie is well over twenty years old and that Van Dammes voice has become so low since then is amazing.Probably the only movie that could become a video game, Bloodsport is Van Dammes movie through and through, from a time when the star was already hailed as a superstar before their first proper movie was released (see Seagal: above the law).Riffing on Enter the Dragon and very loosely based on fact, this is by the numbers action. fighters from every culture and country join the 'Kumite', a tournament so special, it has a song about it.Van damme is a soldier who has gone AWOL to join the fight, in honour of his shodoshi. as the film and fights progress, he becomes friends with a hairy biker, becomes enemies with Bolo, and flashes his behind to a journalist.it's classic stuff, with cheesy one-liners, silly sub-plots and an amazingly awful electro soundtrack to back it up. but this is why it's loved by so many people, it doesn't take itself seriously, it's not art, it's the type of movie that after each fight sequence, you could go to the shop, come back and not have missed a thing.it's a showcase for Van Damme, and it does it's job.Brilliant.",Bloodsport
17,Aaron1375,One of Van Dame's best movies,7,9 October 2009,"I am not the biggest Jean Claude Van Dame fans in the world, but this one was actually rather good to me. Though the role is no stretch for Van Dame as he plays a guy in the military who is a martial arts master after being trained by a man whose son died so Frank (Van Dame) convinces him to train him instead. Using what he is taught he is off to this legendary underground tournament called the Kumita (not sure of the spelling of this one). For the most part it works though there is a subplot of some guys trying to get Frank out of the tournament because he is trained by the military and they do not want to see their investment ending up really hurt or worse because of the tournament. This subplot seems more like an add on to pad out the film a bit, but it does not really interfere with the plot to badly. The highlights of the film, come predictably enough from the tournament action as Frank quickly makes his mark by upstaging the reigning champions time of fastest knockout. There are many interesting fights in this one and the dude playing Ray Jackson was really good and funny in his role and added some nice comedy to this martial arts film. Though the ending fight was not exciting enough for my money and I really found it unnecessary for them to make the guy cheat, though it is a better fight than the one in the movie ""Kick Boxer"" as once the brother was saved the fight was over.",Bloodsport

19,Mr-Fusion,An unlikely gem,8,21 July 2016,"Halfway through ""Bloodsport"", I had to be reminded that this is a Cannon movie. Yeah, the movie's got their cheap fingerprints all over it, but very (very) few of their films are this entertaining. The story has the requisite themes of honor, dedication and friendship, but this is just an excuse to watch a wide array of different fighters beat the living hell out of hear other in the ring.You can throw in all of the gratuitous butt shots and Van Damme splits you want, but there is something about that score (Stan Bush for the win)that keeps things chugging along past the ridiculous one-liners and cut-rate acting.

The subplot of the two military officers, Helmer (Norman Burton) and Rawlins (Forest Whitaker), scrambling around Hong Kong to find Dux blends in well with the main plot and delivers some added intrigue and comic relief to the story.The film contains some plot holes, for example, the reason why the HK police never investigated the underground martial arts operation was not explained. But, it's still a good flick that action movie fans should enjoy.Grade B",Bloodsport
22,lost-in-limbo,"""Teach me. I can do it.""",6,19 March 2011,"Probably best known for being Jean-Claude Van Damme's break-through role, but the pulpy ""Bloodsport"" (which is inspired by true events of former fighter Frank Dux) delivers good fist-pumping, brutal and sweaty martial arts action set in Hong Kong's underworld. Van Damme's Frank Dux is a marine who heads to Hong Kong to fight in the Kumite, the ultimate, but secret martial arts tournament consisting of the world's best fighters putting their lives on the line. The championship defender Chong Li, a crowd favourite has his eyes on Dux.Stock storytelling, but the martial arts is well-captured and in full-contact. We get the usual flashbacks filled with childhood memories (where the Dux character is portrayed by a dopey looking kid with an even dopier sounding voice), Dux being trained throughout his childhood and into early adulthood by his martial arts mentor Tanaka. There he learns to control pain by being stretched out, catching fish with bare hands (which would become handy later on in life involving a lady reporter, fellow Syrian fighter and a bet), managing to pour tea while blindfolded while blocking a punch. It's all about training hard and building up spiritual confidence, with nothing but concentration on the face. The baby face Van Damme told much more through his animated facials than through his stilted dialogues, which seemed to consist of one line than a pause and then another line. It's an emotional ride filled with pain, pride, and romance and touching male bonding, accompanied by some cheesy soundtrack inclusions and it showed back in the day it was cool to wear you pants above your waist. All of this drama and words of encouragement (""You good fighter. Good. Good."") leads up to its climatic final fight of epic proportions. The polite, relaxed underdog up against the deadly, egotistical champion where slow motion features highly and the intensity remains strong with the yelling, screaming, dirty acts and worried faces. Oh it's beautiful. Watch the faces. It's all in the faces. Pure magic.Director Newt Arnold keeps it up tempo and provides a good montage of fighting, while using the locations to good use. The support cast are able with the likes of Donald Gibb, Leah Ayres, Forest Whitaker, Norman Burton, Ken Siu and Bolo Yueng is memorable as Chong Li. An pleasurably cheesy fight outing.",Bloodsport
23,ElMaruecan82,"""Bloodsport"" with B like one of the Best of B-movies ...",7,29 October 2014,"""You're not a Tanaka"" ""To honor you, Shidoshi"" ""Bricks don't hit back"" ""What does it change if Bruce Springsteen is his Shidoshi"" ""It hurts just looking at you"" ""Aren't you too young for the Kumite?"" ""Aren't you too old for video games?"" ""Go, USA!"" ""Say it, Say it"" ""Matte!""  If I can recite so many lines from memory, then I guess it wouldn't be nice to give the film a bad rating, no matter how bad it is by objective and respectable cinematic standards.I know I'm a sentimental, I know that ""Bloodsport"" doesn't get everything right, but there's one thing it does get right : the fights and that's enough even if the rest is pure 80's cheese which still smells (and tastes) better than TODAY's cheese. Indeed, I'd take 10 ""Bloodsport"" over any of our current high-budgeted, CGI-driven and noisy blockbuster because ""Bloodsport"", like the competition it features, has no other pretension than thrills and entertainment. Of course, it's easy to laugh at some parts, yes, some quotes ring false or corny, but never the fight scenes.I can hear the objections coming everywhere, yes, you can see some parts coming, when the sidekick played by Donald Gibb -not a poor man's John Goodman but a poor man's Randall Tex Cobb- cockily threatens the villain Chong-Li that he'll be next on the floor, you can tell one mile away, that he's going to be to Frank Dux' Apollo Creed. But this is what the film is, it is to Rocky what the Death Wish series was to ""Dirty Harry"", a logical continuation driven by the popularity of Karate and exploitations movies in the 70's and the vulgarization of modern-day violence.The most emblematic figures of this period are the Cannon tandem of Golan and Globus, their legacy is made of flashiness, over-the-top violence, synthesized pop-song, contrived lines regurgitated with ominous music and long 'I mean business' silences- like Chong Li, who, by the way, has only one English line spoken, yet with a voice that I suspect belong to another guy, and an attitude that screams 'bad' in every frame. Thankfully, the fight scenes don't have that mechanical hit and hit back aspect but are rather well-choreographed with a music in total wavelength with the 80's, catchy. A succession of guilty pleasures, like good old Golan and Globus know how to make, nothing's been spared, not even the obligatory montage before the final fight.By the way, I don't know if it's their Israeli background that influenced the script but I wasn't even shocked that the most coward and stupid character was named Hussain. Good old Hussain, probably a nod to the late Saddam, a pretty blonde journalist comes to interview him, he wants her in the hotel room, Arabic fashion I guess, she refuses, he's about to slap her (she called him a name, so I guess she deserved it) but the providential help of Dux will fix the situation via a coin trick that takes several viewings to understand. Well, in all fairness, no stereotype was spared either, a redneck American, a Japanese sumo-tori, not to mention the scene-stealing African guy fighting monkey-style.There's one actor who deserves a honorable mention though, it's Forest Whitaker, his performance stands above the others, even as a comic relief, some of his priceless reactions as the offended rookie show the premises of a talent waiting to bloom. It's still Van Damme's movie, after ""Karate Tiger"", where he played the antagonist, this was the time for the Belgian icon to prove his value, and he did. A champion himself, he came to Globus-Golan, not asking for a job but telling them he was the one they were looking for, I guess his talent, his good looks and his guts convinced their business sense. As if not a good actor, Van Damme was a great actor in his success, and that deserves respect.This is why I'll always have a soft spot for ""Bloodsport"" and as the French title ""no holds barred"", and this is why I wonder why it took me so long to review a film so rooted in my childhood. I remember when my cousin brought us the VHS, we saw it together, I liked it, but he loved it, after watching this film (he was 12, 2 years younger than me) he started playing Karate and he made it till the brown bet. The film triggered a passion and his room was full of Van Damme and Bruce Lee posters, and that very year, we watched as many Van Damme movies as we could get from video stores, in fact, Van Damme became that actor I never missed one film.The JCVD mania lasted from 1992 to 1995. When my cousin saw Van Damme's pose as Guile in ""Street Fighter"" he was disgusted, he went on playing Karate, but the game was over with Van Damme, and ""Time Cop"" and ""Street Fighter"" became the last films I saw. My story with van Damme stopped as well. But rediscovering ""Bloodsport"" took me back to that sparkle on the eyes of my cousin, that enthusiasm when he talked about Karate, and when I told him I would start Karate again (I stopped after 3 months). I guess he was too young for ""The Karate Kid"" but ""Bloodsport"" did accomplish something a few movies do, inspiring, channeling a sort of positive energy.And in fact, when you look at Van Damme's story, inspiring is the word, before he'd make a fool of himself, most of it because of cocaine (what would you expect from a victim of fast success) Some say it's all made up, Frank Dux is controversial and there's no proof whatsoever on his accomplishments but nonetheless, Van Damme's accomplishments are real, inspirational and that doesn't need any proof, watching the film is enough.",Bloodsport
24,A_Different_Drummer,Arguably best Round Robin Martial Arts Film,10,8 November 2013,"From my notes on Bloodsport: 1. The film that launched JCVD. I shudder to think that out there in film land, there are legions of viewers who accidentally stumbled on some other of his 8 zillion films as their first ""JCVD experience"" and then, when that particular film had ended, turned to the nearest living person they could find and simply said one word ... WHY? Because you really really really need to see this JCVD film first, before any other of his films (except Timecop, which doesn't really count, because it was so different from his usual roles and his usual films) to grasp why this man became an overnight hit, and why the films he is currently producing -- films that look like they were shot on an iPhone and edited in the back of a Tesla -- still manage to find an audience. 2. A great film. An entertaining film. A well-acted film. A film you could see over and over. 3. Possibly the best (or at least top-tier) in the round-robin fight genre, where different contenders vie for a prize. What most fight film directors keep forgetting is that, for the formula to work, each fight must build on what came before. This is the template. They nailed it.",Bloodsport
25,851222,Kick-Ass awesome,9,26 August 2015,"Greetings from Lithuania.When i was 6-8 years old, ""Bloodsport"" (1988) was one of my favorite movies around. It was so good martial arts movie (and in general i didn't liked martial arts movies), but it was also just a very decent film overall.The fighting action scenes were awesome, characters were simple yet sharply drawn - it was easy to identify who is good who is bad, who fights dirty and who is just fun to watch at. It is probably still my favorite movie with Jean-Claude Van Damme, and it even had Forest Whitaker! (didn't new him for sure at the time). The training scenes i still can remember after 20 years now (this is how much time have past since i saw this movie last time).Overall, ""Bloodsport"" is not deep at ideas, but it was almost perfect for what it wanted to be - a Kick-Ass martial arts movie with characters we do care about. This is one of the very best (and probably my favorite one) of it's genre. And the last fight is simply unforgettable stuff.",Bloodsport
26,Movie Nuttball,Bloodsport is a excellent fighting film!,10,25 May 2002,"This is one of the great movies of the 80s in MY collection that I think about all the time. Minor SpoilersBloodsport is arguably Jean-Claude Van Damme`s best film next to Hard Target. It begins with such a cool intro with the fighters and cool music by Paul Hertzog. It has a few good songs too! It has very good fighting and it is a serious movie. Here is a brief look at the film`s best competitors that are most likely to win the Kumite.Bolo Yeung as Chong Li - Chong Li is the undefeated champion that holds many records and will do anything to win a match whether it is to break a man`s leg, knock him out or even kill his opponent. He has huge muscles and there is no telling how strong he is. Every fighter is in trouble when they step in the ring against him.Jean-Claude Van Damme as Frank Dux - Frank Dux is a great fighter taught by Tanaka. He a hansome,musclar,smart,and kind man that cares. He know just about it all when it come to fighting thanks to his great master. He really cares for his new friend Jackson. Paulo Tocha as Paco - There is one kickboxer type fighter named Paco. He is a great fighter but he doesn`t block well but he has two advantages. 1. Paco`s opponent`s should not trust him when he reaches out to shake hands because he is a cheater and 2. is when he grabs ahold of his opponent its all over with!Donald Gibb as Jackson - Jackson is a massive man with a bad attitude but is a good friend to Frank Dux. He is very tuff,strong, and is able to beat up anyone though he fools around too much and that`s his only mistake.Michel Qissi as Parades - Parades has big thick legs that hits his opponents hard but like Paco he is not a good blocker and that is his only flaw.Bloodsport has many other great figters but these are top ones in the Kumite. If you like Jean-Claude Van Damme and fighting films then be sure to check this awesome Jean-Claude Van Damme movie out soon because in MY opinion it is a classic!",Bloodsport
27,tarbosh22000,"If you haven't yet, see the much-imitated but never duplicated charm of Bloodsport.",7,8 October 2011,"It's definitely time we reviewed this classic! As you surely know,  Frank Dux (Van Damme) is an ""American"" martial artist who has gone  through rigorous training since he was a kid by his master Tanaka  (Chiao). When Frank takes part in the most underground,  no-holds-barred, to-the-death fighting tournament in the world, the  Kumite, most people try to stop him. That includes love interest Janice  Kent (Ayres), and Dux's army superiors Helmer (Burton) and Rawlins  (Whitaker). But Dux becomes buddies with Ray Jackson (Gibb), a  charismatic tough man, and they support each other. But will anyone  have what it takes to defeat the sinister, murderous fighter Chong Li  (Bolo)? Man, did Cannon really hit one out of the park this time. Not  only did it set the careers of Van Damme and Forest Whitaker in motion,  it almost singlehandedly set the mold for all the many Punchfighters to  come. Of course, to the Bloodsport people, it's not just fighting, it's  a ""martial science"". I guess martial arts are just too lowbrow for  them. The Kumite has no weight divisions, so hulking brutes fight  against skinny wimps without a second thought. Guys even have quirky,  unique styles, and even the ""knockoffs"" are quality productions - look  at Shootfighter (1992). And the ""knockoff"" even spawned a sequel! Such  is the awesome power of Bloodsport.  But they say the word ""Kumite"" many times, so that's this movie's  version of Best of the Best 2 (1993)'s constant repetition of the word  ""Brakus"". When these action movie people come up with a good word, they  really don't let you forget it.  JCVD never gets tired of showing us that he can spread his legs widely  (and weirdly), and he has plenty of funny facial expressions. He's  supposed to be American, but his accent is pretty thick - ""Belglish"" is  a bit more like it. He and Ogre have good chemistry together. Sure,  Gibb is great, and he brings the movie up, but what would it be like  had the role been played by Jack S. Daniels? But Van Damme as the  ""spiritual warrior"" and Gibb as the brash basher is a winning combo.  It's colorful, it's fun, it's entertaining, and it's fast paced. It  also has some great songs and Hong Kong locations. What more could you  ask for?

The villain is one of the best of the genre.The story is supposed to be based on the true tale of Frank Dux, this has been disputed from a number of circles as fiction. I'm not a lawyer and don't want to have to hire one :) So just ignore the basis of the story. The story works well enough without any extra external noise.The star is JCVD, he sells the movie tremendously as does Don Gibb playing the over the top sidekick.The fights are not overly long which can be an issue with some MA films that have a 30 min scene of non-stop action where you can make a coffee! In Bloodsport the fights tell the story and are as long as they need to be to get the job done.The parts of the story outside the ring/mat/stage have suffered from ageing and come across as pretty cheesy now, but the core of the film holds up well.Very enjoyable film",Bloodsport

He's from that era of martial artists like Steven Seagull you made outrageous claims to their ""military and martial arts careers"" when they were B-rated action movie stars during the 80's.
The movie itself isn't so bad. It's a time piece for the 80's with its music, clothing and over the top fight scenes. Claude Van Damn is meh. His dance and acrobatic moves are all good for show but lack any sort of real fighting value.
Bolo is jacked up on steroids in this movie. He really must have been pumping the 'roids during this period. If you look at pictures of him in Bruce Lee's movies and then later in life when he's in his 70's you'll see the difference in his size.
The Kumite isn't real. There has never been any one else by Frank Dux who claims it is real and to consider that there have been several hundred fights in the last fifty years, along with thousands of fighters, no one else has come forward to support Frank Dux's claims.
Frank Dux also makes claims about the ""world records"" he held but these are only in his own mind. He made this stuff up to make himself look more important. In reality he didn't hold these three records because he claimed they were from a fake fight tournament
Did you know that to have 56 consecutive knockouts in a single elimination tournament, you'd have to have 72,057,594,037,927,936 fighters participate?

The quest for heroism, real martial arts, charismatic highly skilled fighter as a lead, and clever fight sequences.At the time of its release, the low-priced cinemas, nicknamed ""the summery"" ones in my country, were crammed by the teens who loved that new wave of martial arts movies, and that newcomer (Jean Claude Van Damme). I do remember colleagues, from school, who jumped over the school's wall to catch a movie for him. Sure (Van Damme) could prove his uniqueness among the action heroes back then (Sly), (Arnie) and (Chan). And with his impressive skills, he could be a factor of originality for this movie's repeated story.Overall, I loved the simple yet effective script. Despite being clichéd, it worked highly. However, some points were a bit weak. For instance: the motive to go to the tournament; it was only to honor the old Japanese mentor? Why that mentor didn't honor himself previously, we didn't even hear him talking in regret that he couldn't win it once (anyway, thank god it wasn't a revenge story!). The reason of chasing the lead, by the 2 agents, was for being a deserter? Not a convincing motive either! Then, the lead character. He seemed unbeatable since the start, whereas his capacities were many and rare. Not seeing one point of weakness in him led to know - pretty soon - that he would beat all of his competitors; which hurt the movie with frank predictability. And finally the way the American friend was presented for the first time as brazen to girls? It wasn't so accurate, plus there was another brazen already, namely: the Arabian contestant.Speaking of which, at one point, that Arabian contestant, who has the name of (Hussein) and the wear of headband, harasses the female American journalist, played by (Leah Ayres), and then the lead beats that impudent brat by a trick. Ok, it's so typical. Because in all, and I mean ALL, the movies produced by (Cannon Group), headed by (Menahem Golan) and (Yoram Globu), the Arabian characters are none other than a negative thing, and from all the angles. It was a point that I believe (Van Damme) paid attention to, some time early, and avoided repeating it, particularly after knowing that his movies have good popularity in the Middle East countries.I hated that they tended to insert a nude scene. Obviously, the movie had enough elements to be a success, so it didn't need this commercial entreaty. Whether the producers' idea, or (Van Damme)'s, both ways it was cheap, rather degenerate.On the positive side, (Donald Gibb), as the American friend (Ray Jackson), was incredible. I don't know why that comic and lovable actor wasn't utilized anywhere else. He's just a big body to block the way of the lead in all the movies I have watched for him; which is strange and sad. In his scenes, (Forest Whitaker) steals the camera by his utter childish reactions. Though, how he was cast as a law enforcement agent while looking like a shy kid in a high school?! The soundtrack is a trip to the 1980s. The way it comments on the events is cool. The editing, redone by (Van Damme), did solid and sedate job. Some shots were so well made, on their top is where the lead was doing his split, while what seems to be a meditation moment, in the hotel's balcony, viewing the whole country from above; aside from its sheer beauty, it was solemn, having a touch of mysticism, as if he - by activating his physical and mental capacities - managed as a human to be higher than the city's skyscrapers, appearing as the king of Honk Kong.There are 2 extra reasons that helped this movie to be a success. Firstly, seeing (Van Damme) doing the split; it was sort of unprecedented for a movie star to do, turning into (Van Damme)'s most famous trade mark, so how about doing it - in the same movie - for a total of 7 times! Secondly, the poster's picture with (Van Damme) flying in the air heading for pointing a kick to his opponent by his feet; a move that next video games based upon this movie I think. That not-CG-picture fascinated many male, mostly very young, viewers back then, and you can see how posters for movies like (The Next Karate Kid), 6 years later, would copy it.In 1996, (Van Damme) kind of remade (Bloodsport) as (The Quest); a movie he wrote, directed, and starred. Although it was a flop, but that mirrors his true passion towards that hit movie from 1988, which launched him along with showing some of the most important martial arts fights since (Bruce Lee)'s (Enter the Dragon - 1973). And - sorrowfully - it mirrors his downhill within less than 10 years of his career's start as well.Save its negativities, it's a fun time with pure, honest, and not that bloody martial arts. I didn't run into these certain qualities, gathered in one movie, that much before or after. Simply, the entertaining B-movie wasn't that entertaining unless few times in history. It's a fair example for a formulaic low-budget action that could be the best of itself, and with its plain themes, smart choreography, hip music and capable lead, it became not only a hit in its time, but a cult classic. Sometimes a mix of simplicity and efficiency is an equation for being classic.",Bloodsport
34,generationofswine,An Honest Review,10,6 October 2020,"I've been pretty harsh reviewing Jean-Claude Van Damme movies, and even though he is significantly older than me, I have the feeling he can still kick my butt, so maybe I should back off a little.Honestly though, this one is pretty watchable. Make no mistake, it is no Chinatown, but, who cares, it is a fun way to hit all the tropes of the martial arts genre and it does it in a way that you know is going to be copied, even if it was already kind of a copy of Enter the Dragon only without the art.So, what you have is a bloody trope filled film that is fun to watch and vaguely (in the vaguest sense of the word vaguely) based kinda sorta on a true story that one guy said happened and was never really verified.So.... sit back and pop some corn, you'll love this.",Bloodsport
35,dee.reid,Van Damme does the Kumite,7,28 May 2006,"""Bloodsport,"" the 1988 debut vehicle of Belgian martial artist and ""actor"" Jean-Claude Van Damme, opens with one of the most impressive montages of fighters preparing for the Kumite, an illegal full-contact mixed martial arts tournament held in Hong Kong. It gets the audience ready for the bloodiest cultural display of martial arts combat in decades.We're told that there are three ways to win a match in the Kumite:1) You knock the guy out2) The opponent gives up and shouts ""matte,"" which is like saying uncle3) You knock the other fighter right off the matEnter into the picture, clean-shaved United States military intelligence officer Frank Dux (Van Damme), of whom this film's story is supposedly based off of. Dux became the first Westerner to win the Kumite, after going AWOL from his post (and two officers including Norman Burton and an underused Forest Whitaker are dispatched to retrieve him), and used his superior combat training, indomitable spirit, and iron will to defeat the legions of vicious opponents sent his way. Dux (like, ""put up your dukes"") is first introduced as a teenager, coming under the tutelage of a venerable martial arts master who instructs the young man in a brutal regiment of non-stop combative training to prepare him for the Kumite.Once in Hong Kong, Dux befriends fellow American Ray Jackson (Donald Gibb), also a Kumite fighter, and the two prepare for combat. There is a lot of mystery surrounding this illegal martial arts tournament, which has its origins in ancient Chinese culture. No one will talk about it, especially to nosy reporters like Janice Kent (Leah Ayres), much less pick fights outside the ring, which would result in an automatic disqualification if a brawl took place outside the Kumite.When it comes time for the action of the great tournament, 40 or so fighters look over one another, eager in anticipation of jumping into the ring and duking it out. But Dux and Ray are prepared, but nothing can ready them for the hulking South Korean fighter and current Kumite champ Chong Li (""Enter the Dragon"" Bolo Yeung), who has a reputation for fighting dirty and is rumored to have once killed one of his opponents.The validity of Dux's story and military background have come under intense scrutiny in recent years but I'm not paying any attention to it. All I can do is pay attention to what's in front of me. ""Bloodsport"" is a perfect star-making vehicle for the Muscles From Brussels, though some studio execs didn't think so. Van Damme had to fight like there was no tomorrow to get ""Bloodsport"" released and even then, the critics were still not impressed but who cares? It's no where near as bad as it was made out to be, it still made the man a star, and the basis for one of my favorite fighters from ""Mortal Kombat,"" Johnny Cage.Director Newt Arnold keeps a fine pace but the only things that seem to hold it back are some cheesy moments of levity and Van Damme's acting (surprise, surprise). Again, who cares? ""Bloodsport"" is a martial arts movie, first and foremost - why a need for acting? When the combat begins (with action choreographed by the real-life Dux himself), blood flows as one fighter after the other is knocked out leaving a titanic duel between only-standing Dux to duke it out with the brutal Chong Li. In between, though, we see many great styles from all over the world including straight-up Chinese gong-fu, Karate, Hapkido (my own current style of training), Capoeira, Sumo, Monkey, Muay Thai, and some good old-fashioned American brawling.Even in recent years, ""Bloodsport"" is still a wholly decent affair that does get bogged down in some cheap Hollywood theatrics. Van Damme doesn't seem to be fairing well either in these times, but we still have this film and some of his good earlier works to appreciate.7/10",Bloodsport
36,Fluke_Skywalker,Bloody good fun,7,31 May 2015,"'Bloodsport' certainly suffers from all of the problems any movie from this era and of this genre naturally would, but just as Frank Dux triumphs over Chong Li, so too does 'Bloodsport' conquer the cheese factor.Jean Claude Van Damme may not exactly be De Niro, but he has an easy, natural charisma that lifts everything around him. Combined with his impressive physical gifts--here at their absolute peak--and you have a star making turn.Filled with colorful characters, fun fights and a host of awesome 80s trappings, 'Bloodsport' is a genre essential, and a Van Damme classic.",Bloodsport
37,jimbo-53-186511,"Van Damme fans should get what they want here, but it's not an entirely satisfying film",5,10 September 2015,"Frank Dux (Jean-Claude Van Damme) decides to turn his back on the military so that he can compete in the Kumite (which is a full contact fighting tournament held in Hong Kong). However, this is a no-holds-barred event where participants have been killed in the past. This competition puts Dux on a collision course with the undefeated champion Chong Li (Bolo Yeung) and Dux finds that he must pull out all the stops in order to come out of this competition alive.Bloodsport contains many of the staple ingredients that you can expect from a Van Damme film; wooden acting, cheesy dialogue, a predictable story and some rather in-your-face direction. I personally think these things form part of the charm with his films and with these expectations in mind I seldom criticise his films for continually serving these things up (sometimes I just like watching these nonsense films). There are however some things which are not really forgivable in a JCVD film such as....POOR PACING; I think part of the problem here is that this film seemed to introduce unnecessary elements which did seem to slow the film down - the two officials going to Hong Kong to try to get Dux out of the competition which seemed to just act as an unneeded sub-plot. I also could have done without the underdeveloped and uninteresting love interest with the news reporter as well. These aspects served no real purpose and should have been omitted from the story - yes I'm aware it's based on a true story, but how about just focusing on the interesting stuff? The story is also quite poorly developed which wouldn't be as much of a problem if it was a fictional story with a fictional character in the lead role. However, Bloodsport is based on a real character and it perhaps could have offered a little more insight into its central character.Despite the above problems, the 'meat' of the film is actually quite good - the fight sequences are pretty good (although many of the fights are a bit too short for my liking). The fights are quite brutal here and director Newt Arnold leaves very little to the imagination - there is one truly horrific scene that caused me to look away from the screen. The friendship that blossoms between Dux and Ray Jackson was also quite a nice angle to the story.I quite enjoyed Bloodsport, but what really lets it down is its rather poor pacing and its lack of insight which I've previously mentioned. Taking everything into account though this is an OK film which should please Van Damme fans.",Bloodsport
38,gcd70,Action schmaltz,2,30 May 2008,"Incredibly based upon the true story of undefeated Kumite champion Frank Dux is this action schmaltz from writer Sheldon Lettich and director Newt Arnold. The whole pic is nothing but an excuse for a whole lot of karate chopping, bone crunchin', blood letting brutality that shows us some neatly choreographed fighting, but zero mentality.The hopelessly lame plot is truly an insult, and it makes this pic perhaps even less bearable than a martial arts doco. Van Damme isn't asked to do much, but when he fights he looks petty impressive. Alongside him are some fearsome lookin' dudes, with nasty Bolo Yeung (as Chong Li) showing off with some flexing of his well rounded pecs.

Then the American doofus turns his back on the ''bad guy"" to his detriment. And for the final laugh, the bad guy pulls out the ''secret dust"" and tossed it into his opponent's eyes. Man, I saw that shtick on Stampede Wrestling in the 70s.I'd hate to think any kids signed up for martial arts lessons based on this farce.On the other hand, the ladies will enjoy the beefcake.

40,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,Van Damme's athletic beginning,8,19 June 2012,"Jean-Claude Van Damme is known for his athletic and flexible abilities. But for some that may feel that they do not see enough, should see this movie for that reason alone. The physical look of Van Damme is just one marvel alone. There is no muscle line that isn't visible on his torso because it is so well toned. Also while fighting, Van Damme makes some crazy looking faces.Van Damme plays Frank Dux, a man with a background in martial arts and military combat. The character, Frank Dux, is actually a real person and amazingly enough, Dux was the man to train Van Damme and get him ready for his role in this movie! Dux's history is shown to us in the very beginning of the film where we see a boy who is taken under the wing of a martial artist. From there he trains with him until he is old enough to participate in the Kumite. The Kumite is a world tournament that has fighters come from all corners of the earth to compete in the ultimate competition to be called the world's greatest fighter.The hardest thing to deal with this tournament is that any possible way of winning the match is allowed. Some of the things done against opponents are can get the blood boiling because it shows how players are willing to do anything to win. It's the perfect reason why the title of this film is called ""Bloodsport"". However, because Dux is enlisted in the military, he is not allowed to par-take in such events; but this does not discourage him. Actors Norman Burton and Forest Whitaker play the two gentlemen, who try and catch him. But there is no point to having these characters in this story. It's not that they're obnoxious but they don't encourage the plot to move on. All they do is slow it down or completely stop it in its tracks.Fighting in the ring along with Van Damme's character is Ray Jackson, played by the husky and rather giant Donald Gibb. At first, in the beginning of the film, I was almost convinced that Jackson was going to be the main enemy but he turned out to be likable and reliable friend to Frank Dux. And although, Jackson is clumsy now and then, he still packs one heck of a punch. He knocked out an opponent with one knock on the head! That's tough!Another part I didn't understand why they didn't include this character enough was Janice Kent performed by Leah Ayres. Fine and dandy that she becomes Dux's love interest and spends one night with him. But after that she's left in the corner and never talked about again. Why? If she's going to play an important role, make it important, not just 3/4 of the way through the movie! The music, by Paul Hertzog was a good touch though. The tunes had a strong zen feel and at points where Dux was super focused, it almost felt like you're there with him too.Bloodsport contains the blood it promises and has impressive fighting matches. Now if only the crew could figure out what to do with the minor characters. But the rest is entertaining all the same.",Bloodsport

 The person who JCVD is playing - Frank Dux - is allegedly a fraud. He can't prove that he set all of those records during his so called distinctive career advice a martial artist.

42,Sandcooler,Kicking and screaming,8,29 January 2006,"This story to this movie is very straight forward, that's what's so nice about it. Van Damme enters a fighting tournament and tries to win it, meaning that this movie mainly consists of fighting between Van Damme and some random Chinese people. The plot is as transparant as a glass door, but why should this bother anyone? The villain is incredibly unsubtle, Van Damme is implausibly good, but this is pretty much exactly what I expect from this sort of flick. It doesn't stop me from rooting for Van Damme, nor does it really kick me out of the story. The fights, especially the inevitable showdown with Chong Li, are pretty spectacular. None of them look particularly convincing given that the punches miss by about a mile, but the choreography is still beautiful to look at. This is one of my favourite guilty pleasures.",Bloodsport

Starring Jean-Claude Van Damme, Donald Gibb, Leah Ayres, Bolo Yeung, Forest Whitaker, Norman Burton, Roy Chiao, Ken Siu, Philip Chan. (R)Van Damme, in his breakthrough role, plays Army Captain Frank Dux (a real person, believe it or not), who goes AWOL in order to participate in a ""secret"" full-contact martial arts tournament--quotation marks applied because it seems that anyone, be it a bland reporter (Ayres) or witless military investigators (Burton, Whitaker), can score good seats. Slim and silly showcase for the athletic star is far funnier than it is exciting; writing and acting are both pure amateur hour, and even the fights aren't especially well-staged or executed (relying too much on slow-motion and hard cuts that interrupt any balletic grace on display). Gibb, of ""Revenge of the Nerds"" fame, seems out-of-place as a competitor, but if ""Enter the Dragon"" could sell us on John Saxon, well... Has gained a considerable cult following over the years, and in defense of the picture's fans, it really is the best way to see Van Damme drop into a split to deliver an uppercut to an opponent's nether regions.

44,sarastro7,Pretty crappy,4,19 January 2005,"Bloodsport, I believe, was a great success when it came out. I only just saw it, and I can't say I thought it was deserving of much respect. I had to laugh at the terrible acting, and the myriad ridiculous excuses for showing that damned Van Damme split.Basically, the movie is Karate Kid meets Mortal Kombat, but neither the story nor the actors offer any excitement. There is about one good line; when Jackson walks in on Van Damme doing the split thing, he says, ""Hey, be careful with that; you might wanna have kids one of these days!""The fights in this movie are nothing special, although of course Van Damme is capable of some impressive kicks. Compared with a half-decent Hong Kong produced kung fu movie, however, Bloodsport is hopelessly inferior and profoundly unimpressive.For the cheesy silliness of it all, I'd give this a 3 rating, but because it is (supposedly!) based on the life of a real martial artist, I'll be a good sport and rate it a 4 out of 10.",Bloodsport
45,jaredmobarak,Dux is my manBloodsport,5,9 December 2007,"I am, of course, a cinema purist. I can't stand watching films on TV if they are going to be interrupted by commercials or edited in anyway. I won't even start watching something I have not seen unless I started at the very beginning and went to the end. However, with a couple friends over and a little Mystery Science Theater 3000 atmosphere, I threw all those rules out the window and experienced the last hour or so of the cult classic Bloodsport. Did I watch it as a piece of art? Not really. It was more the spectacle of cheesy 80's aesthetic and campy acting/dialogue that kept me from turning the channel. Was the first hour something important? Who knows, and who cares. I got the gist of what was occurring and from fight to fight knew who the hero and villain were and found myself needing nothing more.I love the tagline for the film""The secret contest where the world's greatest warriors fight in a battle to the death."" How misleading is that statement? The connotations to Mortal Kombat are unavoidablewith rumor being that Johnny Cage is mirrored off our lead character Frank Duxbut to the death is a bit of a stretch. One fighter dies in this film, ONE. When he is murdered, the judges and crowd turn their backs on the killer, unable to condone the brutality. I want to know who marketed this and give them a high-five for skewing the truth to sell some seats. The movie could never be a to-the-death fight and work. Not only would we lose all respect for our hero, but also he would never be able to take a life as shown on screen. The tournament would have been shut down too, with American military cops showing up, people everywhere knowing about the event, and reporters going undercover for a story. If death was prevalent, not even the Triads could keep it up.The beauty of the film, though, is in its soundtrack. Synthesizers and falsettos abound transporting you back in time to bad acting, teased hair, and crazy characters. Every second is chock full of unintentional comedy and my friends and I had a blast with it. Jean-Claude Van Damme made a name for himself off this film, and he does not disappoint. Deserting his army post in order to go to Hong Kong to fight and avenge his master's death, this American fighter has the thickest Belgian accent possible. Maybe they explain that he was naturalized as a US citizen in the time I missed, but either way I guess it doesn't quite matter in the grand scope of things. You cannot get enough of his slow-mo shaking body and wide eyed defiance on the battle mat nor the hammy looks of fear once his adversary Chong Li gets embedded in his head to the point he even manifests him on the bus. His romantic involvement with a reporter is also laughable. There is no chemistry between them at allI think there might be more between he and friend Ray Jackson played brilliantly by Donald Gibband the relationship culminates in a horribly orchestrated scene of them bowing to each other hand over fist. At least it is an ending to put a smile on your face, not from contentment, but from sheer absurdity that you stuck with the story its conclusion.In the end, however, you have to see the film for one performance only, Forest Whitaker as the army cop. No, just joking, what the hell was he thinking doing this film? The real reason is Bolo Yeung as Chong Li. This guy is the epitome of evil. The guy is massive and his menacing stare down is so scary you have to laugh from fear or else you may soil yourself. His silent screams and excitement are so unnecessary and out-of-place that they actually work. This guy doesn't need to scream or yell. You actually start thinking he may be a mute until he finally tells Van Damme he is going to kill him before the final fight.Is Bloodsport quality cinema? Is it even nostalgically worth seeing as a piece of art? The answer is no on both counts. Would I stop flipping channels and watch it next time its on TV? Definitely. As a comedy, the film is wonderful. I can't even say the fighting is spectacular because it is always subverted by laughs. Between the guy acting like a monkey and the Sumo hugging people into submission, every single second is priceless and unforgettable.",Bloodsport

47,PartialMovieViewer,"The Bar for All Others - A True Karate Classic (On Par With ""The Karate Kid""",10,15 November 2016,"Blood Sport – what can I say, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie.

With that being said, this is about the only thing, that I have seen, I really enjoyed starring Jean-Claude Van Damme. Unlike Ralph Machio's ""Karate Kid"", this guy already knows skills. What skills you say? Well, back then, most of us didn't call this kind of fighting 'martial arts' – we referred to it as 'karate.' Why? Well probably because we didn't know anything else back then – with the exception of ""kung fu"" of course. If it wasn't for David Carradine, we wouldn't know that much. Getting back to ""Blood Sport"" and what it is about. A-hooga – A-hooga""Spoiler Alert"" – ""Spoiler Alert"": A guy walks into a room full of 'karate guys'; picks a fight with each one and ends up kicking all their butts. Pretty much the ""Karate Kid"" between adults and without the ""wax-on-wax-off"" dialogue. Does this sound familiar? It should since now-a-days every movie is pretty much the same basic story. The only difference between this movie and modern productions is that now-a-days, the hero is either a woman or a cartoon character. I am fine with that, like my opinion matters. The script, writing and direction are all functional. A basic good verses bad gala event with all sorts of fighting and groans and grunts.

49,ivo-cobra8,A cult classic best martial arts Van Damme Style movie!,10,29 December 2015,"Bloodsport (1988) is my favorite action Van Damme movie. It was the first movie I ever saw about Van Damme that introduced me in to his movies. This is the film I grew up with it, I have first see it, when I was 8 years old! I love this movie to death! In my opinion is Van Damme's best martial arts film! Beside Hard Target, Bloodsport is one of his best movies till date. I Love it so much. Best martial arts movie, is never boring, is fast and entertaining and It is awesome seriously. And I still love it today, Bloodsport also introduced me in to martial arts. Jean Claude Van Damme's Bloodsport is still today it's best. After this movie there were a few copycat movies that copy the idea from this movie. Like were Bloodfight (1989) with Bolo Yeung returning, with the same name, but playing different character from the Bloodsport and Bloodfist (1989) with World Kickboxing champion Don ""The Dragon"" Wilson. I also love the music from this movie lately it helps me a lot the song ""On My Own - Alone"", I also love the song ""Fight to Survive"".This is my favorite tournament fighting film too. This film also inspired the video game Mortal Kombat and for that? This film is twice as awesome to me. This is a film where you see JCVD at his peak and this is my second favorite JCVD flick after Hard Target and Universal Soldier. It holds up really well to this day and it's a shame the film does not have a special edition on DVD and Blu Ray. The film does have a big cult following so it not getting any features to this day is lame. Great concept, great cast, charismatic characters, bad ass fights, and a kick ass soundtrack. This is definitely one of the best martial arts flicks ever made without a doubt for me. Fell in love with the film ever since I saw it on VHS when I was a kid.As for the Bloodsport sequels? For the most part? They all suck. They can't even hold a candle to this film. Bloodsport is a classic and a fight that is worth watching anytime, anywhere. I still own this movie on VHS and on Blu-ray. I don't have the DVD I don't need it. I am going to say it again I love this movie to death, it is my childhood JCVD film and I grew up with it. I have always enjoy it. It has a real bloody bad-ass fights. Van Damme and Yeung kicks fighters to the ground. Original this movie was almost never released, but Van Damme helped edit the film so that it could be released, this movie is praised and loved all over the World including Asia, USA and East Europe. The real Frank Dux was the fighting coordinator for this film. When Jean-Claude Van Damme was cast, Dux announced that Van Damme wasn't nearly in good enough shape, and put him through a 3-month training program. Van Damme called those three months ""the hardest training of his life"" - this despite being a world-championship martial artist in his own right.It does feel good to go re-watch films like this especially dealing with the very sad fact that films like this classic aren't made anymore and seeing Van Damme these days on film, he just seems to stone faced or depressed. I have enjoyed training sequences, flashback sequences on Frank Dux's earlier childhood life and a life of a young man. The chase sequences where Helmer and Rawlis are chasing Dux was hilarious and very entertaining. Chong Li, in my opinion, is one of the best non horror villains out there. My personal favorite JCVD villain and my favorite martial arts villain. Also, though it isn't the same character; almost like a bizarro world version, another Chong Li appears in a movie called Bloodfight (Bloodsport knockoff) played by Bolo Yeung. Van Damme maybe had some problems in his later years, but I always admired him for everything he did to make this movie well known back in '88, from re-editing the original cut to promoting the movie by putting posters of it himself in cinemas. This movie for me is a perfect 10, I don't care what anyone says.",Bloodsport

51,Libretio,Only die-hard JC Van Damme fans need apply,4,5 January 2005,"BLOODSPORT (1987)Aspect ratio: 1.85:1Sound format: Ultra-StereoBelgian beefcake Jean-Claude Van Damme made his name in C-grade video fodder like BLOODSPORT before hitting the big time in a series of mid-range Hollywood blockbusters (UNIVERSAL SOLDIER, TIMECOP, etc.). Here, he portrays real-life kickboxing champion Frank Dux, one of the few westerners to triumph in the Kumite ('koo-mih-tay') tournament in Hong Kong, an underground full contact martial arts contest whose final rounds are often fought to the death. However, all 'facts' aside, the movie amounts to little more than an excuse for as many bone-crunching, bloodthirsty fight scenes as the script will allow, building to the inevitable showdown between Van Damme and his only comparable opponent, a hulking Chinese villain (HK movie veteran Bolo Yeung) who has already lain waste to every other competitor in the tournament.While the action scenes are reasonably effective, the dramatic interludes are fatally compromised by bland staging and cheapskate production values (director Newt Arnold appears to have helmed only three films over the course of a lengthy career, during which he's worked mostly as an assistant director on some of Hollywood's biggest movies, including THE TOWERING INFERNO, THE GODFATHER PART II and BLADE RUNNER!). Love him or loathe him, Van Damme is the film's trump card: Captured here at the height of his physical prowess, he strikes an impressive figure during the various combat sequences, where his aptitude for gymnastics and contortion are displayed to full effect. Leah Ayres (THE BURNING) is mere decoration in the thankless role of a journalist who beds Van Damme in an effort to worm her way into the ultra-secret tournament (only to end up falling for him anyway - ho-hum), while Forest Whitaker (a year before BIRD established him as a major talent) and veteran actor Norman Burton play Army cops with a warrant to arrest an AWOL Van Damme on sight. Police officer-turned-actor Phillip Chan Yan-kin (HARD-BOILED) cameos as - you guessed it - a police captain who turns an unlikely blind eye to the Kumite, while Donald Gibb is Van Damme's tournament buddy, a big American blowhard whose arrogance is painfully tempered following a gladiatorial encounter with Yeung. The script was co-written by Sheldon Lettich, one of the more talented figures in the low budget action arena - he wrote and directed LIONHEART (1990) and DOUBLE IMPACT (1991), along with the genuinely impressive ONLY THE STRONG (1993) - but BLOODSPORT has little to offer anyone other than die-hard fans of impoverished HK movie wannabes.

Burton and Whitaker (the only two to offer halfway decent acting) play CID officers on the hunt for Dux. Despite bad acting, disappointing choreography and endless clichés, none of the paper-thin characters are exceptionally unlikable (though this might be because they're so poorly developed) and the Hong Kong setting is captured so vividly.

55,Min111,I like the soundtracks,7,12 July 2020,"This is one of Jean-Claude Van Damme's best films. Majority of people will say it's his 'best' film, and I will find that hard to disagree with if that's the case. I liked everything about Bloodsport. The fights. Everything. What I liked most about Bloodsport was the music. I can't believe how good the music actually was. It fitted very well with the film. Some of the songs are 'Fight To Survive' and 'On My Own'. Let's not forget the rest of the soundtrack. The music made this film very good. Jean-Claude Van Damme plays a character named 'Frank Dux' who is a martial artist. He decides to leave the military, so he can compete in a martial arts tournament known as the Kumite. It's a illegal tournament held in Hong Kong. Frank Dux goal is to become the champion. Can he become the winner? You need to see it to find out. I rank Bloodsport along with Jean-Claude Van Damme other films such as 'Kickboxer' and 'Sudden Death'. There are others too, but the ones I've mentioned are some of his more popular ones. Let's not forget the fighting - that's where the real action starts. Unsurprisingly! Van Damme dominates inside the ring against all his opponents. His most challenging fight was the final where he was up against the current champion Chong Li. That fight against Chong Li was amazing! I really liked the music in the background during that fight. It fitted well I thought. Also, let's not forget Frank Dux friend called Ray Jackson. He made this film interesting to watch. I like how Ray and Frank become real good buddies. They both complemented each other. There are other characters too, but you need to see it first to get the whole picture, and understand what this film is about. I liked Bloodsport because it was staring Jean-Claude Van Damme, and he's my favourite action hero. Van Damme fans will like this film for sure. It's one of his best...",Bloodsport

57,Cinemaniac1984,Van Damme kicks his way to international stardom in his starring debut.,7,20 September 2015,"Many audiences either like Jean-Claude Van Damme or they dislike him. Either way, in the late 1980's and throughout the 1990's there was no bigger star than Jean-Claude Van Damme. Van Damme had appeared in a few small movies but in 1988 Bloodsport launched his career into super stardom by showcasing his spectacular martial arts abilities and athletic prowess. Although Bloodsport was not a critical success and it certainly did not set the world on fire with its acting, it has developed a reputation as a cult classic and also attracted a legion of loyal Van Damme fans.Jean-Claude Van Damme plays Frank Dux, a US Army Captain who has gone AWOL to participate in an illegal martial arts tournament named the Kumite which is well known to be secretive yet brutal. Frank Dux participates to honour his master Senzo Tanaka (Roy Chiao) who took Frank under his wing as a child and taught him the ways of martial arts. Upon Frank's arrival in Hong Kong, he befriends fellow American competitor Ray Jackson (Donald Gibb) and liaison/manager Victor Lin (Kenneth Siu). Frank also finds himself heading towards a collision course with the defending champion Chong Li (Bolo Yeung), who is a vicious and remorseless fighter who has killed participants in past tournaments. At the same time, Frank finds himself romantically involved with US journalist Janice Kent (Leah Ayres) who has been assigned to investigate the Kumite, and Frank must also avoid being arrested by two Military Police CID officers Helmer (Norman Burton) and Rawlins (Forest Whitaker in an early role).Van Damme had a likable presence throughout his halcyon days and nowadays his star isn't as bright as it used to be as his career is stuck in the doldrums of endless forgettable direct-to-video movies. Here in Bloodsport, Jean-Claude Van Damme has a certain charisma about him along with his athletic prowess and that's what attracted many audiences to see Van Damme's movies.Don't listen to the nay sayers and forget the hokey acting, Bloodsport is still an enjoyable and entertaining martial arts movie years later. Bloodsport is definitely one of Jean-Claude Van Damme's most memorable movies in his starring debut and certainly one to remember as the movie that launched his career.Highly recommended for all Van Damme fans as well as fans of martial arts movies.7/10.",Bloodsport

59,Bogey Man,Surprisingly pleasant film in its genre,8,3 July 2002,"Newt Arnold directed this Hollywood debut appearance of Jean-Claude Van Damme in 1988. Damme is young here, but does perhaps his finest performance here. He plays the real life character Frank Dux (check the IMDB Crazy Credits section for more details!) who participates in the secret martial arts contest held in Hong Kong every fifth year. There are many fighters and different martial arts, and the scenes of fighting are plenty and stylish and occasionally even Hong Kong style, which means lots of slow motion, lots of high jumps and different fight styles and great use of camera during the fight scenes. I didn't have any expectations about this film since I'm not any fan of Van Damme's. He does decent performance in John Woo's US debut Hard Target, but I'm not particularly interested in Damme's films, but watch them gladly if an opportunity appears. In Bloodsport, he acts also decently and never irritatingly, which is great thing. I think this is his most noteworthy performance because he is pretty natural here and does the fight scenes with skill (as always, though). I think fans of martial arts films and especially people who practice martial arts like this film. The fight scenes are not too realistic as in real life, these kind of punches and kicks would've killed a person, but it is usually the case with these films, but definitely don't try this at home!The music is as 80's as possible with ""great"" Kumite song performed by some 80's pop/rock band, and there are also some great pieces of electric music in here. The best parts of the film are the scenes at the contest since, as I mentioned, the fight scenes are so stylish and interesting due to their cinematic technique. The title Bloodsport title is explained at one point, so there is fair amount of violence and blood in this film, so don't try to watch it if unrealistic violence and this kind of stuff offends you; necks are snapped, blood is spat, but only sometimes fighters are really hurt or even killed. I don't know what the experts of martial arts think about these films that don't show the real results of this kind of violence, but probably they wouldn't like it. I found this very noteworthy piece of martial arts action films and in its own genre, it gets an 8/10 rating from me, but if you are interested in REAL martial art movies, start to track down films from Hong Kong and Asia. And there are MANY others than Bruce Lee, Jet Li and Jackie Chan as they are only the most popular fighters of the Orient.",Bloodsport
60,malkane316,Quick Reviews!!,7,4 May 2005,"Although it has aged quite badly as most films of this type from the eighties have, Blood Sport is a favourite from my youth and is one of Van Damme's best early efforts. There are no strings and no CG here so the fights are all the more impressive, and it is always refreshing to return to those days. The plot and characters may be simple, some of the acting may be amateurish, and the music may be dodgy but Bloodsport remains an enjoyable no-brainer for fans of the star or genre.Van Damme stars as Frank Dux, a soldier in the US Army. He has been trained by Tanaka all his life in martial arts, and wishes to travel to the infamous Kumite tournament in Hong Kong to avenge his friend's death. The Kumite is a tournament which attracts the best and most vicious fighters from around the world, many of whom are seriously injured or killed while taking part. Dux breaks orders and travels to Hong Kong, but two soldiers follow him in an attempt to bring him back. There he meets Ray Jackson, a fellow fighter and Janice Kent, a reporter trying to get an inside scoop on the tournament. From there we see many fights as Dux progresses in the tournament whose defending Champion Chong Li (Bolo Leung) is a deadly killer. Naturally they meet in the final.Once the plot devices of revenge and honour are put in place all we have to do is sit back and watch the fights. They are well-staged, there is a fair amount of violence, some humour, and the main cast do as well as could be expected. This is a must for Van Damme fans, but there will be little for anyone who does not watch martial arts movies.7 out of 10",Bloodsport

Yeah, the story's a no-brainer; its the eighties after all and these films didn't have a deep plot to begin with which is acceptable. Back in those days, the fight scenes were much better compared nowadays with all the hyper-edited, attention deficit disorder fight scenes that todays movies have. It's a shame that most directors don't sit up and take notice of these past films and turn up much better product on their part. Can't say anymore about this film but its fight scenes are great despite being a little annoyed at seeing Van Damme doing the same kick over and over again. Good lord, is that his signature move? Shouldn't matter because it's made so long ago. And Forest Whitaker is in it!! It's a solid flick just to kick back to.",Bloodsport
63,deepfrieddodo,"Iconic, But Terrible",5,22 March 2021,"I quite like JCVD's work, and this was his real breakout role, but he has released far far far greater films since Bloodsport. I recognise this fits a very niche part of cinema, but it's just not good. I assume the vast majority of those with speaking roles were not actually actors, as bar from three of them they were all terrible. One was Ayres (the only woman in the film), another was a very young Forest Whitaker (which is strange to see), and finally Bolo Yeung, who - although barely speaking - is superb as the evil foe.The choreography is a mix of great and very poor, some of the fights are brilliant to see, others have guys forgetting which way their head should rock when they're hit. The climactic fight is worth waiting for with some cool slow-mo shots, split between JCVD's insane facil expressions.The story and plot is actually fairly good, but the fact that the real Frank Dux convinced even a single person that this is a real story is a travesty. Beyond laughable. He claims to have inflicted 56 consecutive knockouts in a single tournament, which would require 10 times the world's population to be participating. I am yet to find anyone who fought in this Kumite in my day to day life.",Bloodsport
64,NightmareOnElmStreetFan,My number 1 personal favorite the best martial arts tournament film of all time in Van Damme style,10,8 February 2019,"My number 1 personal favorite the best martial arts tournament film of all time, with Enter the Dragon! The best martial arts movie from Jean-Claude Van Damme he ever did. Enter the Dragon (1973) with Bruce Lee is my second personal favorite best martial arts tournament. Bloodsport and Enter the Dragon were my inspiration on martial arts, how to defend my self against bully's. It was the first Jean-Claude Van Damme movie I watched as a kid that introduced me in to Van Damme movies. I love this film to death, this is type of my movie. I am a huge number 1 Van Damme fan. It is now 30 year anniversary since this movie come out.Bloodsport is in my top 10 Van Damme films. I grew up watching his movies, I talk with my friends about Van Damme and his movies including Bloodsport we mentioned, when I was sick in a hospital, it is really my childhood film. We can all agree Bloodsport is one of Van Damme best films, he ever did and worked on. I heard over YouTube that Hollywood was planning to reboot this film without Van Damme, but that did not work.The film stars: Jean-Claude Van Damme, Donald Gibb, Leah Ayres, Norman Burton, Roy Chiao, Forest Whitaker, Bolo Yeung, Michel Qissi and Philip Chan. Directed was by Newt Arnold.This is one of the best martial arts tournament: Frank Dux (Van Damme) enters the Kumite, an illegal underground martial-arts competition where serious injury and even death are not unknown. In town Hong Kong for the fight are number of fighters, as well as a journalist determined to get her story. Chong Li (Bolo Yeung), a particularly ruthless and vicious fighter is the favorite, but than again Dux has never fought him before.This was really a film in which was based on Frank Dux life but some people claim he lied, but I don't care. He really trained and prepare Van Damme for this film, this was really Van Damme's toughest training he ever had. The fighting styles are for real, every fighter has deadly technique using against his opponent, everything in this movie is done for real. It is bloody, you see Chong Li breaking Suan Paredes (Michel Qissi) leg really bloody gruesome. Van Damme spin kicks with his leg on his opponent in the back head knocking him down wow. I love the back story of Frank Dux from his early childhood, till his military service adult as he goes on his own to Hong Kong to honor his dying martial arts teacher Tanka (Roy Chiao) who trained him. Philip Chan is also in this movie from Hard Boiled who plays again Police Captain in this movie.I really love everything about this film, it is fast paced, entertaining goes fast around I love how they filmed this film. I love the filming locations shots in Hong Kong. I love the music theme from Paul Hertzog. I love the soundtracks in this movie: Fight to Survive and On My Own - Alone by Stan Bush and Steal the Night by Michael Bishop.I love the training sequence in the opening in the movie which some of shots are brutal on Van Damme. I love the ending fight between Dux and Chong Li in which Van Damme uses four spin kicks on Chong Li's head destroying his opponent awesome. One of the best martial arts films of all time. This is my personal favorite number 1 martial arts tournament. Enter the Dragon with Bruce Lee is the second favorite of mine that is my opinion. Donald Gibb as Ray Jackson was excellent who become Frank Dux's best friend. Donald Gibb returned with his character in the sequel.I have this movie on Blu-ray and I also still have the VHS tape at home I bought it in High School I still have it. Bloodsport is my number 1 personal favorite martial arts tournament and one of my favorite Van Damme movies. It is in my top 10 Van Damme films, this is my movie I am number 1 Jean-Claude Van Damme fan I love his movie: Hard Target, Cyborg, Universal Soldier, Bloodsport, Kickboxer, Lionheart, Death Warrant, Double Impact etc...",Bloodsport
65,dk77dk,Bloodsport : A Story Of Honor,10,11 February 2021,"An underrated and inspiring film for all martial arts fans.Van Damme shines here because this role is perfect for him. He doesn't need a stuntman, because he performs all the scenes himself. The choreography is good, as is the directing itself.The characters are fun, and that's what makes this movie so good. Bolo Yeung is absolutely brilliant and intimidating as the villain Chong Li. The film definitely has charm and possesses some timeless quality.The film is interesting for several reasons, not only as a film about martial arts, but also as a drama that speaks in its simple way about human emotions. It is easy to identify with the characters, because they are portrayed humanly, emotionally and above all through the prism of the friendship. Jean Claude Van Damme is first and foremost an athlete, not an actor, and this film is perfect for him and maybe that's why everything here works as it should.This film impressed me because of its charm and simplicity and because it reflects the spirit of another time. The film has truly fulfilled its primary task, it is entertaining and easy to watch. What matters is that this movie can be watched many times and is always just as fun.Courage, loyalty, friendship and honor are the values that this film
celebrates and that in itself is commendable.A cinematic work that definitely deserves its place in the history of martial arts films.",Bloodsport
66,jonathanruano,"Enjoy JCVD's karate, forget about the acting and the plot",7,10 September 2011,"Jean-Claude Van Damme was a little known body builder who starred as an extra in films like ""No Retreat, No Surrender,"" before ""Bloodsport"" transformed him into a big star. The plot of ""Bloodsport"" is as basic as it gets. Frank Dux (JCVD) is the classic underdog who has the potential to be a great martial arts sensation. Dux gets to realize this potential in a competition among the world's best fighters, known as the Kumite. There are the obligatory scenes showing that Dux has some flashes of martial arts genius. Then comes the fight scenes which all end predictably right up to the big fight at the end. Along the way, this film also borrows the worn out formula of the Rocky IV movie in particular. Yet ""Bloodsport,"" despite its simplicity and formulaic plot, is a fun kind of film. Van Damme is not a great actor, but he is an appealing one all the same. Moreover, the martial arts sequences are a lot of fun especially when accompanied by Paul Herzog's 1980s music soundtrack. Then there is the apologetically macho dialogue which is of course lame, but fortunately also unintentionally funny. Lines like ""Very good, but brick no hit back,"" and ""You break my record, now I break you like I broke your friend"" are abound in this film. Lastly ""Bloodsport"" benefits from two surprisingly good actors. I have known my fair share of martial arts masters and Roy Chiao's performance as Senzo Tanaka is as authentic as they come. Unlike Miyagi, who often has a twinkle in his eye, Roy Chiao plays Tanaka with a straight face and shows only grudging admiration to his promising student, Dux. It's truly a fresh take on the Miyagi character. Another actor that brings a lot to this film is Bolo Yeung (playing Chong Li) who does not have a lot to say, but can communicate a great deal by how he reacts to Dux's surprising progress over the course of the Kumite.",Bloodsport

In this Kumite, we also have a heavies as Donald Gibb (Ray Jackson), an everlasting funny guy! And Bolo Yeung (Chong Li), a creepy, bad acting, but charismatic dark fighter. I loved Bolo here, he was always bad ass on films, and he is perhaps one of the most worthiest opponents to Van Damme on screen.

Although supposedly based upon true life events happened to the real Frank Dux ( who in later years went through litigation with Van Damme over the higher budget spoof of ""bloodsport"", ""the quest"" ), the plot is as thin as a spider web. However, this is the 80ish martial arts movie like people loved it to be. Plenty of well-choreographed fight scenes, a decent score by Herzog ( ala Rocky IV) and extra subplots like the romance one (which i read is often a requirement to have the screenplay approved ) and the police chase, which are stitched together for the sake of it. 8-10 because it is a true classic, without much plot frills like those Hues, Rothrock, Norton 80ish movies.If you want a ""message"" or true realism, go watch Karate Kid I; if you want excellence in fighting, go watch Bruce Lee...",Bloodsport

But like I said, it's not only about martial arts, it's a great movie in other terms too. There was many touching moments, like that dialog between Frank Dux and Tanaka at his son's funeral or the last fighting scene. There was many other touching moments and I would like to write about it but I'm afraid, it may spoil the movie. The soundtrack was great, it really fit in this film.

Of course, the fighting is good. It's not just good, it's great. It was really exciting to see different fighting styles from all over the world. And Bolo Yeung did a really great job as the villain. He barely talks, but shows with his behavior that he is Mr. ruthless himself. The final fight with van Dammes trademark, the 360-kick, shown several times in slow motion, is a feast for the eye.

Seeing this movie now it's so easy to see the silliness and bad acting that plagues it. However, as far as Van Damme's career this was the film that made him a superstar and, in my opinion, the one role that he personified the best. That's saying a lot, because watching this movie nowadays I realize how BAD his acting was, but then again he's here for his martial arts skills.  Not to say he's that good because there are COUNTLESS people better than him....Van Damme is a ballerina compared to true martial arts experts like Jet Li, Jackie Chan, Donnie Yen, etc etc.  Everyone knows the story by now; the movie on a whole is entertaining, but it seems more like a comedy than a martial arts biopic.  There's silliness everywhere, from the dialogue to the actual fight scenes themselves; so much that you can't help but think that the makers of the film really went overboard with their 'dramatic license', and hardly any of the events in the film really happened.

Van Damme and his sweaty abs look like they think they're in a 80's softcore parody of Enter The Dragon with 'acting' to match. The movie itself pulls a Confessions of a dangerous mind (2002), in that it purports to be a ""true"" story based on one man's unverified claim - the real Frank Dux is a known liar/exaggerator, with a lot of the stories he told the screenwriter later being shown as such. With this story, Dux got a buddy of his to corroborate it. Later after they had a falling out, the friend said Dux coached him to say it. And yet the male bimbos who defend this still buy into a story with nothing to back it up. I guess that's why they call it a cult movie.
You spend 20 minutes watching live-action Action Figures (Van Damme even looks like he's made of plastic) kung-fu fight (choreography that's been done better in almost any other kung-fu movie you can think of) and 70 minutes wasted on a purile hyper-cliche cardboard excuse for a plot (""I must avenge so-and-so by competing in this sport/tournament for some reason!"") just to frame those 20 minutes where things actually happen.

For example, one guy is supposed to be hitting another guy's head with his knee, but you can clearly see that it's not hitting him. Bolo Yeung has a nicely villainous mein. The claims about the real life Frank Dux are pure hokum. The man is a fraudster of the most ludicrous kind. For example, the movie claims that he knocked out 56 men in a row to win a tournament. No tournament can have 56 rounds. The number of participants would be 2 to the 56th power, which is over 9 million times the population of the earth.",Bloodsport

80,KHayes666,Junbi......Haji....HAJIME!!!,7,20 January 2008,"As the years go by and the world is more subjected to MMA, UFC and K-1 events in the mainstream, the one that started it all had to have been Bloodsport. Think about it, did anyone give a damn about K-1, MMA or anything like that in the early 1980's? Out comes this movie and 20 years later kickboxing has become more popular than regular boxing and wrestling.Based on true events, Bloodsport centers around a secret underground kickboxing tournement called the Kumite (pronounced Koo-Mitt-Tay) that has been around for thousands of years. Jean Claude Van Damme plays Frank Dux (as in put up your dukes), an American of French decent who stumbles upon an old Chinese martial arts teacher who teaches him the way of the warrior so to speak. Many years later the teacher is near death and Frank pledges to win the Kumite in his honor. Standing in his way is Chong Li (Bolo Yeung) , the current champion along with Helmer and Rawlins (Forrest Whitaker), two American agents assigned to bring Dux back to the US unharmed since its revealed Dux is a captain in the US military and wasn't supposed to be in this thing.I say the actual Kumite scenes were done well in terms of the actual fighting but the transition and timing was downright awful. In one scene Chong Li snaps Suan Parades (Tong Po from Kickboxer) leg and then the next scene shows Dux fighting someone else with Parades sitting in the stands unharmed. I think the Parades/Chong fight was supposed to be one of the last but it fit better in the music montage so they jumped the gun with it. Later on the big sumo Pumala is visbily shown sitting behind Jackson and Lin, and while he's fighting Dux and Monkey Man you can clearly see him sitting in the same spot while he's supposed to be on the runway. Also, Dux and Chong Li looked to have fought about 10 guys between them in the first 2 days of the tournement yet Ray Jackson (Donald Gibb) fights twice on the first day yet makes it to the last fight of the second day? One last thing, Dux beat his guy in 12 seconds to set the world record and later on I timed a fight where Chong Li beat a black guy in 6 seconds....wouldn't that mean he got his record back? The good news is the actual fighting and different styles more than made up for the clumsy editing and the story lines/sub plot fit well with the overall point. Donald Gibb was hilarious in his role, and its always nice to see Tong Po with hair. Bolo Yeung looks younger than Van Damme and was a short time away from his 50th birthday during the course of filming, I didn't even believe it until I checked the bio....hell he's pushing 75 now and I bet he could make a comeback in one more flick.I don't want to give away too much but if you want full contact bloodshed and Ogre from Revenge of the Nerds throwing people around one more time, this is the movie for you. Yes there is a love plot between Van Damme and Leah Ayers and if thats not your thing hit the fast forward button, otherwise sit back with your gi and enjoy the movie. The highlight of the movie is Ricardo Morria aka The Monkey Man, you'll know what I mean once you see the movie.7 out of 10 (3 points off for the bad editing)",Bloodsport

He be friends with the American loud mouth fighter Ray Jackson, and be nemesis with the worst brutal fighter from Korea Chong Li .It is a martial art movie, but it has a strong touch and fights are intense.

But who cares about the story and the acting? All we want is fighting, isn't it? But even the fights in this movie were bad. I mean very bad. Most of the time JCVD actually does not look like he is fighting. He just shows us how muscular he is. His moves are slow and his enemies do not move. They just stand there and wait for him to hit them. The fight with Bolo Yeung was pathetic. Really bad choreographed and terribly shot and... Well, I don't think it could be called a fight - each one of them just stands there and waits for his turn to hit. Bad, bad, bad... Why the fights are so bad, why?

83,vovazhd,Cult film highlighted by excellent martial arts,5,19 August 2008,"Bloodsport is a martial arts film about Frank W. Dux, an American who travels to Hong Kong to participate in an underground martial arts tournament known as the Kumite. Although it's based on real events, it's clear that Bloodsport isn't very accurate in that measure. The fighting styles are authentic though.Jean Claude Van Damme plays the role of Frank. He definitely gives the appearance of someone who could win the tournament, but otherwise his acting is poor. Bobo Yeung plays the bad guy and manages to equal Van Damme's quality in acting. The rest of the acting is terrible, with the lone exception of Donald Gibb as Ray Jackson, another Kumite participant who becomes close friends with Frank during the tournament.The directing is mediocre. It was especially bad during the beginning (the flashback sequence was completely unconvincing), but improved as the Kumite became the focus of the film. There are very few artistic moments, perhaps the alleyway scene going to the tournament being the most effective one.The redeeming element is the fighting. Every tournament battle is unique and offers contrasting martial arts styles. Van Damme is especially impressive in his technique. I also liked the fact that each Kumite participant had a distinct personality.As it stands, I could see Bloodsport being entertaining for most people, but I could only seriously recommend for people who love martial arts. It succeeds in bringing tournament action, but fails at building any drama.",Bloodsport

His breaking through, ""Bloodsport"", is a flick that could have been so much better.First of all they could have changed the script. At times Bloodsport is almost an adventure-movie because of unnecessary elements and therefore rather unrealistic. I would like it to be more of a fake-documentary or a documentary ""wannabe"" which only focus on Dux and the tournament. The character Jannice Kent has really nothing to do in this feature, she just makes it worse.The music is contemporary and therefore boring. I would like ""Bloodsport"" more if it had more Chinese music or something corresponding to create more mood in the film.Newt Arnold´s direction isn't really weak but it could have been a more interesting view with less editing, more pans with the camera together with slow and quick zooms.The fact that ""Bloodsport"" is short for being a feature is just a plus, but some of the fights could perhaps been longer and they could perhaps also having some more fights without spoiling the overall impression.Overall, Bloodsport is for me a big disappointment that misses it's potential but in the same time at some moments a good movie.Rating: 4+ of 10.",Bloodsport

Van Damme NEVER ONCE stepped in the ring and fought in Kickboxing.

96,liodavix,"Van Damme, always in my heart.",8,17 March 2019,"Bloodsport, ""Bloody Sport, or Bloody Contact,"" as it was called in Spain, is a special film in many ways.To begin with, it was Van Damme's real debut on the big screen. It is true that he had already participated in five films before: The most savage among all, Monaco Forever, Disappeared in combat, (is uncredited), and Breakin, all of 1984, and as the Russian villain, as was usual at the time He never retreated in 1986. But all these papers did not serve to throw him into stardom, since they were low-budget films that barely reached a small sector of the American public.Feeling that his career did not seem to have much exit, Van Damme decided to play it ""all for everything"", and in 1988, two years after his last film, which shows the difficulties he was going through to make his way in Hollywood, He went to Hong Kong to shoot, ""Bloodsport"", an independent film with his first role as protagonist. It was a very modest film in the media, but for the first time Van Damme would have the freedom to show his full potential, not as an actor, because in that he was still very green, but as a martial artist, where all his strength and charisma resided.
The bet was a success to his measure. The chosen director, Newt Arnold, one of the most reputable directors of the second unit of the moment, made what would be his third and last feature film. His work in the film was quite good, taking into account that this man had never made a film of martial arts, most of the shots and frames during the matches are simple but superb, without the need to make the viewer go around a thousand times with the camera, as with many martial arts movies now.Likewise, the recreation of the tournament was quite efficient, creating all that fascinating and sordid clandestine atmosphere, and with those dark alleys of the huge apartment blocks, showing the most sinister side of the Hong Kong city.Van Damme as Frank W Dux, fulfilled what was expected of him. It is not that he performs a great performance, in what refers to the dramatic scenes, but his poses and facial gestures during the battles supplied those shortcomings, especially in the final fight.The casting of wrestlers was the greatest success of all, as they were all real fighters and even champions in their respective specialties such as Paulo Tocha, Attilio Reale or John Law among others ....Attention also to a young man Forrest Whitaker, in his first roles and who still struggles to understand what he does in a movie like this.The variety of styles is considerable, the Brazilian wrestler Suan Paredes showing a curious mix of boxing and capoeira, the Samoan Pumola with a mixture of sumo and wrestling, the companion of Dux, Jackson, wrestling and street, the Spanish fighter Paco, with a very aggressive style, and something rustling, everything must be said, of Muai Thay, as well as many others like kung fu, judo, karate, wing Chun etc ...he fights denote a rawness and realism that I have rarely seen in similar films and in fact the director insisted that the fighters do not stop and really hit if necessary, and that is seen and palpated visually, dotted with Pretty blood, honoring the title. Some fights are spectacular but others, however, are very brief and sometimes too unrealistic. It is noted that there were many cuts, because many of the secondary combats give the impression of having been originally more extensive.Also, as in Kickboxer, it is not explained because in the final fight the villain always slaughters Van Damme initially, but at a given moment, it seems to become a statue merced by the blows of the Belgian.The movie, Chong Li, played by Bolo Yeung, is the best of the film. Raw, sadistic but with an admirable determination and strength, cheating if necessary, anything goes to win, is clearly superior to the rest of the fighters, with that laughter and facial expressions, giving it an almost demonic dimension. Truly, Yeung's work is what makes this film great.The soundtrack of the very underrated Paul Hertzog is simply huge. I have never seen melodies that transmit so many sensations and accompany fights so well. The theme ""Powder"", for example, every time that Chong Li jumps to the tatami is chilling, making clear the danger of this fighter.In definíva, is Bloody Contact a good movie ?. If we had to be cold and honest the answer would be no. It does not count on good performances, its technical level is of series B, and the choreographies are regular.But this is a movie that is carried in the heart. If you saw her as a child and seduced you, then you will never be able to see her as I said above.It will always seem the best of the best, a film that you will see ten thousand times and you will never get tired of feeling the adrenaline rush while watching the blows and falls of those gladiators to the rhythm of ""Fight to Survive"". Or to feel the euphoria when seeing the ""And I'll kill you"" of Ray Jackson to the hated Chong Li, or to get excited and jump off the couch dreaming of being in the place of Van Damme kicking Chong Li ...After all, childhood is a wonderful time, and films like this made it even better. Of that there is no doubt.Thank you.",Bloodsport

Everyone was talking about it at the time especially about Jean-Claude Van Damme, who only did some small roles in movies like ""No retreat, No surrender."" This time he was the main character. Bloodsport tells the story of martial arts expert, Frank Dux (played by Jean Claude Van Damme), who travels to Hong Kong to participate in a dangerous underground competition known as the Kumite. Frank Dux was trained by Tanaka whose son recently died and was going to participate in the Kumite tournament. Frank decides to compete and represents the family name of his master, Tanaka. But Frank has a little problem, he is a special force for the US Army and getting hurt in the competition is not a luxury for the army. The army decides to send agents Helmet (played by Norman Burton) and Rawling (played by Oscar winner Forest Whitaker) and follow Frank all the way to Hong Kong.On his journey Frank meets a big roughneck American call Ray Jackson (played by Donald Gibb) who becomes his friend and is also participating in the tournament. Frank also meets an attractive young reporter Janice Kent (played by Leah Ayres) who wants to write an article of the underground competition. The competition is fearless with fighters from around the world and introduced different styles and disciplines of fighting. Frank toughest challenge is Chong Li (played by the legendary Bolo Yeung) a menacing and ruthless fighter who will stop at nothing. The movie has its cheesy part and the music, well it's the 80s, but our IMDb need to understand that BloodSport is a low budget movie and it launched the career of Van Damme as a mayor action star. It even inspired other movies like ""Kickboxer"", ""Shootfighter"", ""American Samurai"", and more, it also inspired video games like ""Street Fighter"" ""Mortal Kombat"" and ""Fatal Fury"". Years later the Ultimate Fighting Championship introduced us with real live fighters from around the world with the same format as the movie. These are some of the reasons ""Bloodsport"" should be consider as a classic. So, if you seen this movie, I invite you to rent it or buy it and travel the time machine of memories. Those who haven't seen it, I make the same invitation and see the movie that started it all.",Bloodsport

It not-so subtle homo-eroticism, Jan-Van-Damme's American accent and funny backstory, his split, the ridiculously well choreographed fights, everyone line-reading like they are on a high school play. Its can be bad but there is still highlights that made me still watch it.Idk, I like Bloodsport. It is a perfect blend for a so-bad-so-good popcorn film.",Bloodsport

The only thing that saved this movie is the fights. They are great. Bolo Yeung is just perfect, he had been in quite a few movies. Even with Bruce Lee once.

However, if you watch it as it's meant to be watched, that is to say as a no questions asked, straightforward, martial arts tournament movie, then it is a truly great film.Based on an allegedly true story, there is no deep meaning to Bloodsport...but it isn't meant for one to be there. The acting is not mind-blowing, but once again, it's not meant to be. You know exactly what's going t happen in the end, but who cares?

112,DeusWar,Best Martial Arts Movie from the 80s,8,18 August 2003,"If this movie doesn't influence a kid to do his best and tell them that the continual struggles are worth it, I don't know what does.Bloodsport was indeed Jean Claud's first movie, and a pretty good one at that. (for a ballerena) Although this movie does not have good special effects or acting it still has one golden value; RE-PLAYABILITY. Anyone can easily watch this movie countless times without losing interest. Bloodsport has a unique quality to it. It has that 80's carefree quality. A feeling that America is at its height. There is no political correctness. Just the atmosphere of a free, bustling, sprawling Hong Kong is enough to make any classic movie a great one indeed. The grade B acting increases this movie's appeal, you couldn't have it any other way. This movie is just above some Chinese kung fu movies, but just below some of the great Martial Arts movies like ""Enter The Dragon"" and ""Karate Kid"". After all the Jean Claud movies of today one can easily go back to their beginning with Bloodsport, an all time classic. Even though Jean Claud tried to remake this movie with The Quest, I believe that Bloodsport could not be surpassed.Despite being completely unrealistic at times it does appeal to the Martial Arts crowd very well. The movie isn't too terribly hoaky like some Jet Li or Chan movies where you can spot out the increase of film speed or the unrealistic moves (360 degree head butt, fly in the air) It has that secretive, elite, non-commercialized feel to it. It was truly the Martial Arts of the past, unlike its commercialized counterpart of today.I give this movie a Martial Arts Movie Rating of 5/5.I give this movie a rating of 3/5.",Bloodsport

I therefore think this review is justified. All of the kids never had seen or heard it of this movie before, but were glued to it.

114,julian_abadia,Kumite,6,7 September 2010,"Sunday afternoon. After one night of partying, I woke up let's say, at 2 am. With a never-seems-to-end hangover (and thus feeling kind of sick) I turned on the TV and started changing channels. After zapping through the cable for 15 minutes, I found to my surprise Bloodsport on a semi-obscure action channel from I-don't-know-where. If you are familiar with the Cronemberg's film ""Videodrome"", my having found Bloodsport on that particular hour of the day, in that particular channel. one would compare that scene to the scene from Videodrome when the character played by James Wood had found the Videodrome signal.This time, however, I have to point out that a)James Woods' character wasn't as drunk as I was and b) I didn't care if Bloodsport could expose to a brain tumor. Gladly, the latter didn't happen, but I did made an impression on me. Why?, because there couldn't been more of an action cheese flick like Bloodsport. Really, it has all the symptoms that make this movie unforgettable (for some semi dubious reasons): bad acting, lame dialogs, lame music,the American hero, the foreigner almost invincible villain, the tough sidekick, one hot girl and some of the kick ass fights ever. And the end of the day, that is what Bloodsport is all about, the fights. And here where Van Damme and the others fighters excel at. Fast paced bouts, death matches, all of them decently choreographed just to add more drama to this flick. So, in the end Bloodsport won't expose you to any terminal disease. On the contrary, it will amuse and entertain you in a funny way. Better watch it after a serial hangover, it's better in that way. Trust me",Bloodsport

At first, he just wants him to help him train his son, but later starts to train him as well.It was basically just about how fighters like to honor their masters by fighting in a private, full contact tournament to show their worth.This film was typical 80's to its fullest extent. Almost every other scene was a montage. The fighting was some of the worst I've ever seen. The acting was no better. The story had so many flaws in it that the director just tried to use the soundtrack to get across the feelings he was trying to portray through terrible acting Sappy violins for heartfelt moments Happy 80's rock to show having a good time Serious 80's rock to show the fighting was meaningful Sappy Asian music to show being honorable And so on You don't meet someone and spend less then 3 days with them and start to care for them like you do about your own family.

The story is pretty clichéd (Dux wants to win the Kumite to impress his master), but this is still one of Van Damme's best movies, mostly because he doesn't talk a whole lot (though he does show his ass, which I think he is obligated to do in every film). His kickboxing skills are put to good use in the various fights, and the minor characters in the film are also quite good martial artists. Bolo virtually sleepwalks through his role as Chong Li, the current Kumite champion, but does look suitably menacing as a villain.""",Bloodsport

123,sirbriang2,"""Gay Karate Guy"" makes his best movie",8,25 April 2005,"I am not a huge Van Damme fan, but I have seen (and commented on) several of his movies. When you watch Van Damme, you want to see bad acting, bad accents, decent action, and several slow motion kicks to the face. Bloodsport delivers like no other.Let's just start with the acting. Van Damme was not quite full of himself at this point in his career, having played ""Gay Karate Guy"" in 1984's Monaco Forever, so he's actually not as bad as usual. His main supporting actor is Donald Gibb, best known for playing Ogre in the Revenge of the Nerds movies. He basically plays Orge in this movie, too, although he doesn't shout ""NERDS!"" He should have, but he didn't. That is why this is 8 out of 10 instead of 10 out of 10. Forest Whitaker is in this, too. Apparently, being a supporting actor in Platoon, Fast Times at Ridgemont High, Color of Money, Stakeout and Good Morning Vietnam was not enough credit to land him the coveted role of the main military policeman that is constantly outsmarted by Van Damme (!) in this film. Instead, the actor with the best film credits in the movie is the second-in-command military policeman who serves under the person that is constantly outsmarted by Van Damme. Either the casting director was racist, or he could see into the future and knew that Forest would eventually costar in Battlefield Earth and was thus deserving of punishment. Bolo Yeung, the Asian bad guy with the huge pecks, plays a suitably evil villain at the impressive age of 50.The soundtrack is pretty awesome, too. You have a nice blend of lame 80s music combined with a strange theme song that has the refrain ""Ku-mite! Ku-mite!"" The song is so good, it makes you wish Ah-Ha covered it.The plot of the movie is silly. To avenge the death of his Asian friend and make his mentor proud, the military-trained Van Damme sneaks off to Asia to compete in the Kumite. This is the world's most hard-core fighting tournament and it is ultra-secret. The military doesn't want Van Damme to fight, so two men are sent to Asia to get him. They fail frequently until they eventually decide to let him compete. There is a nosy reporter woman that wants to cover the Kumite. Naturally, her main purpose in the movie is to give us a reason to see Van Damme's ass. Van Damme and Ogre become friends after Van Damme beats him in a karate video game. Ogre (for reasons unbeknownst to me) identifies Van Damme's accent as American and the two become good friends. After a shot of Van Damme beating someone up is shown in slow-motion two or three times, Ogre stands up and shouts, ""That's the fastest thing I ever saw!"" You see, if he hadn't said that, the audience wouldn't have known it was fast; they would have had to rely on the timer above the ring that said ""new world record."" Obviously, Van Damme has to fight a number of people, most of whom have comically unique styles of fighting. Just as obviously, Van Damme has to fight Bolo in the end. Van Damme has several slow motion kicks to the face and seven different times where he does the splits. Van Damme doesn't get much better than this.By the way, this is based on a true story. HA!",Bloodsport

Okey, the acting and the dialoges were above average, but that's not what people want to see. We want to see the whole film in particular. The story is very good and the music is AWESOME =). I'm a real fan of 80's music to you who doesn't already know. Van Damme, in this movie is a very good fighter and wants to learn from Mr. Tanaka how to FIGHT. Van Damme has to get through many tests which he manages with some training in no time. When the Kumite starts, the real life begins for Jean or should I say Dux. He has to defeat every opponent to win the special sword which is a Katanasword. He pays his respect in the end to Shidoshi who trained him.
Jackson is a good friend of Dux and they seem to get along very good.Anyway, this movie is special because in this movie you can see all the slow-motion scenes in air and on ground. Another thing that makes this movie so immortal is the fighthing scenes in the end. They are so cool and fantastic!!! This movie is a pearl. A masterpiece of art.

The Martial Arts genre is unique, and one musn't compare it to other types of movies because they are like apples and oranges. Therefore, I will say it is the greatest martial arts film of all time, and in my mind, better than anything else I have seen, even though it is hard to compare it to non-m.a. films. This movie is more than just about fighting. It transcends the entertainment value it was made to provide. This story is about Dux's journey through life, and his struggle to bring honour to his Shidoshi. He is not in it for money, or bragging rights, but simply for honour. Now how many people in today's world care about honour? Not very many. This is one out of many reasons why I love and am inspired by this movie. Sometimes one must undergo great pain and sacrifice to honour and respect someone or something. And that is an important lesson.",Bloodsport

This movie's plot is thick with witty dialogue, brilliant martial arts choreography, and a soundtrack second to none. Of course it has Van Dammes token ass shot (where he shows it for a split second), so for the girls out there who haven't seen it, watch this movie and know why every girl in the 80's loved him. Not only is it Van Dammes movie, it heralds other brilliant actors such as Forrest Whittaker as a MP trying to subdue Frank Dux (JCVD)only to be in awe of his 'moves.' It also has the actor known as Jackson, who is in other movies such as Revenge of the Nerds, who is a brilliant cheesy 80s actor. Oh yes, one other point is this movie also includes an arcade game scene, where Jackson and Dux battle it out on the good ol'2D arcades (probably costing them 20c). I highly recommend this film as it is a masterpiece of the martial arts genre. Favourite quote: ""Okay, USA!""",Bloodsport

136,objesguy,"Why this didn't win an Oscar, i'll never know",10,2 June 2005,"Jean Claude Van Damme is characterized as a superstar of ""craptacular"" films, and to be perfectly honest, he is. His list of films in 90's weren't very good: Universal Soldier, Double Team, Legionnaire. All those movie were forgettable. His real big movie that everyone seems to remember him from is Kickboxer, but honestly that movie should be banned from the United States because it is so bad. Yet Van Damme did have a decent film, and a movie not many know about simply because it was his first film. This movie is Bloosport, and compared to a regular film, it's decent maybe average at best. However, compared to other Van Damme movies, this is a slice of heaven. Not only does it have a decent plot based on a true story that is not wacky or corny in the slightest way (okay, it is corny in some parts, but not to the extent of Kickboxer), but the fighting scenes actually are the best of any American choreographed martial arts film out there. That list is not very prestigious, but for those who thought the Karate Kid was the best martial arts movie out there, prepared to be blown away. Thus, this movie is a ""craptacular"" masterpiece, and a film that needs to be recognized.Even though it is a decent movie, the acting still is horrible. And horrible is a nice word. Since this is Van Damme's first movie, this is him at his worst, and it's extremely hilarious. Throughout the movie, he butchers the mood and the music constantly with his bad acting, making what should be a serious moment and comic one. While his master does a decent job at acting, everybody else follows Van Damme's lead and is equally bad saying lines that don't even make any sense. ""Dux my man!"" Okay, was there a contest for Fruit Loops allowing 12 year old girls from Japan to write the script for this movie? Probably, since half the movie doesn't even use proper or understandable English. In addition, the king of bad actors has a role in this film as well: Ogre from Revenge of the Nerds 1, 2 and whatever other one they made after that. His acting alone should make audiences buy this movie, and I don't mean see it...I mean buy it.I may be a little sarcastic through this thing, but I can't help it. I can't take this movie seriously. It's awful. However, if one watches it with my attitude it will be a delight because amidst all the terrible features is a decent film that every father should watch with their kids, just so the kids know that there are people out there who are way tougher than their dads.",Bloodsport

146,somme22,Bloodsport delivers for Van Damme's Fans.,8,22 October 2005,"Bloodsport is a film that I saw when I was just a kid, and just like then, I still find this movie very entertaining and one of Van Damme's best films. The film also contains some great songs that keep the movie scenes going and provide good background music and are inspirational. The movie centers around Frank Dux, a young man who sets out to Hong Kong to honor his Shidoshi- Tanaka, by fighting in the famed Kumite. Along the way he meets and becomes friends with Ray Jackson (played by Donald Gibb), who coincidentally has also come to Hong Kong to fight in the Kumite. The rest of the movie shows how brutal the Kumite can be-fighters can lose their teeth, their blood, and sometimes even their lives. Frank also meets Chong Li(played by Bolo Yeung), the man who holds the record for fastest knockout. Immedietly they don't get along, and Frank gets to see how cruel Chong Li can be on the fighting ring. When Frank's new pal Jackson gets beaten senseless and sent to the hospital by Chong Li during a fight, Frank realizes that he has two new reasons for fighting in the Kumite: for his Shidoshi, and for his friend Jackson. The final battle between Chong Li and Dux is monumental-the fighting scenes were well choreographed. Frank Dux is unaware that Chong Li has a trick up his sleeve, but the two fight to the end. I recommend Bloodsport to all, especially Jean Claude's fans.",Bloodsport
147,RealityCheck22,This is honestly the greatest martial arts movie of all time,10,1 April 2021,"The Frank Dux story was alright, with so many quotable moments ""why you teach him & not me"", ""teach me shidoshi"", ""the bottom one"", ""brick not hit back"", ""now I break you, like I break your friend""....The stylistic differences with the fighters was ahead of it's time considering 5 years later the UFC began, and the martial arts world started recognizing the importance of well rounded training.Jean-Claude Van Damme was at his peak, and his theatrical presentation of the arts was entertaining & polished.The blonde reporter was decent looking, for that throwbacks 80's look.",Bloodsport
148,evelind7,Great martial Arts flick!,10,20 June 2009,"This movie is great. It is a fantastic movie from the 1980s displaying great martial arts and is one of van Damme's finest films in my opinion.The movie story-line is basic and not very complicated: Frank Dux has traveled to Hong Kong to compete in the Kumite-a full-contact fighting tournament while at the same time dodging two agents sent to bring him back to the United States at for abandoning the military. True, this film has the typical van Damme story-line: someone close to him has gotten hurt and he has to avenge his friends. Yet this film makes up for that by displaying wonderful fight sequences that are colorful and creative.The film has a great villain-Chong Li played to perfection by Bolo Yeung. The music adds to the film by carrying it along and adding excitement when it needs it and comedic flair when it is required. I feel that van Damme's fans will love this film-one of his first starring roles. The only complaint is that there are a few funny scenes in the film that perhaps were not meant to be funny but are. Other than that, Bloodsport is a great movie-worth your time because you'll be rewarded with fantastic martial arts.",Bloodsport
149,Alwehr,"Less talking, more fighting.",10,6 September 2004,"The best martial art movie ever.When it comes to martial art choreography and filming, no other martial art movie can reach this one, unless you are into Jackie Chan or Hong Kong (Jet Lee) karate movies. Now, when it comes to plot, then its a whole different talk. But seriously, who cares about plots when you're watching a martial art movie? Its the fight scenes that counts and this movie is packed with them. Everything else is less important bonuses. And the blend of different fighting styles in bloodsport are awesome. It has got all from dancing monkey style to no budging sumo style. Luckily for us our hero Frank Dux (The muscle from Bruxelles) is an allround fighter and Van Damme does the ass kicking more stylish than any other martial art actor i have ever seen including himself in his later movies. It is simply a joy to watch the fighting sequences because of the fantastic choreography and especially because its filmed in many angles and in a slow enough pace for the viewer to notice all the great details in the fights. And trust me, there's a lot.If you, like me, are a big fan of American martial art movies like ""kickboxer"" and therefore don't care about a very, very simple plot. Then this is the movie for you. ;O)I give Bloodsport a 10 simply because its the best of the best in its genre.I gave it 10 out of 10.",Bloodsport
150,Fast Eddie,Still the Right Thing,8,21 March 2003,"OK, so Van Damme movies are cheesy. And yes, he is worst an actor as you can imagine. And yes, Joey Tribbiani looked more real as a corpse than Jean-Claude as an actor in that Friends episode. Still, JCVD's skill is as a fighter. And this, of all movies, is what fighting is all about. You fight? Then you will recognise your martial art - or style, for those practicing thai boxing, or drunken boxing, or street-fighting - you get the idea. Never has a fight out of kung-fu has been so good represented. 90 minutes of fighting. If you're looking for something else, stay real far. Else, this is The Movie.",Bloodsport
151,DerKill,An Example of how to Make a Martial Arts Movie,10,24 October 2013,"Bloodsport is basically a martial arts fantasy. Its no-rules fighting tournament is right out of a comic book. The fighters, fights, and most of the fighting styles aren't realistic, but they look really good. The cinematography of the fight scenes is excellent, which is practically all you need in a martial arts movie. The tournament is presented as though you are a spectator sitting in the crowd. You get to see various fighters advance through only to get eliminated. Many come and go without once interacting with the main characters. Some of the fighters never utter a word. They're entertaining all the same. Each has a unique look, fighting style, and level of nastiness. Some of them get brutally injured. A lot of the fights don't necessarily add to the story, but they enhance the movie dramatically. The whole thing just works. So many movies have tried to copy the success of Bloodsport. With marginal acting and virtually no plot, it seems easy to top this movie. Only it's not. At its core, Bloodsport is a marital arts movie that does the martial arts scenes better than just about anything else out there. You can't top that.",Bloodsport
152,Guitarboi615,Best Fighting Movie!,10,11 April 2005,"I've seen very many fighting movies and this has to be one of the best, if not the best fighting movie I've ever seen. The intro was what I think is good with a good storyline. The remainder of the movie shows a great friendship, and many, MANY, great fights. I'd have to say probably at least half of the movie contains fights. This movie was based on true events which I think makes this movie a lot more inspirational. Frank Dux also helped make the movie and the fights which really made it great. The fighting scenes were amazing. This movie to me is definitely a 10 if you like to watch fighting movies. Plot of the movie: The main plot of the movie is at first, they show Frank Dux working out in a gym in the army. He plans to go to Hong Kong to fight in the Kumite, an ancient fighting tournament, to honor his Shidoshi, which is his master, in the tournament. Watch the movie to find out why he really wants to honor his master. Watch him fight the hardest fights of his life and get through the hardest obstacles. Overall: This is one of my favorite all-time movies. Even though it was made in late 1980's, I still think it's one of the best movies. It is 100% a fighting movie classic. I've seen this movie at least 15 times and I am still watching it. I am watching it even as I type this commentary. This is a MUST-GET movie if you like fighting movies.",Bloodsport
153,leestallion55,best martial arts movie of all time,10,17 November 2006,"If you look at the rating for this film it is only 5.8 percent at present that is a serious understatement of this films genius. This film deserves a much more higher rating. Okay its not an Oscar winner for acting, but who cares! its not about acting its about true martial arts and fighting on the big screen and Bloodsport brings this to you superbly. One of my favourite movies it also provides the Rocky pump, as in like Rocky it has the emotion both in action and through the films music and the fighting makes you want to get up and starting punching and kicking anything! and you don't get that sort of feeling with many films. Rocky had it and Bloodsport has it, and if a fighting film makes you get up and fight your living room wall then its a winner! Van Damme is excellent, his fighting manoeuvres are breathtaking, the range of different styles of fighters is great and well know martial artist Bolo Yeung's destruction of all opponents is wonderfully filmed, and as Van Dammes main contender we have a great adventure. All the fighters give great performances and the fighting scenes are superb. Great performance from big Donald Gibb as the hilarious Ray Jackson. His running punch on his first opponent is worth watching for that alone! Donald Gibb is excellent and brings humour to the role as well as some excellent and sometimes hilarious no nonsense fighting! The story too is superb, the kumite bringing the worlds greatest fighters together and by invitation only and the location also brilliant. Hiden in the depths of Hong Kong badlands. A winner in all departments. I remember watching this with friends and going out in the garden for some Bloodsport kicking and punching well not each other, thin air! but it makes you feel alive. Not many films do that. 10/10 for me. Fantastic film!",Bloodsport

Cheesy dialogue, cheesy characters, cheesy story line, but it was cool that they actually based it on a true story. The characters and jokes are so bad they are actually good. The nerdy guy with the glasses is supposed to be a comic relief, and he is, but not because his jokes are funny but because they are so lame, and because of the fact that we were supposed to think he is funny. Cool fight scenes too. Almost forgot to mention, the soundtrack is awesome, especially that song that plays during the final fight scene. See it if you haven't. I'd rank this as Van Damme's 2nd best movie.",Bloodsport
155,skullrot1,Van Damme's Best Film,6,28 November 2005,"I have seen many good martial arts films and although i'm not the greatest fan of the genre (I generally stick to Bruce, Donnie, Jet & Jackie) I've always found this movie to be extremely watchable. Being one of the first high-kicking films I ever saw it inspired me, though not for a while, to give the genre more of a chance. It is, in my opinion one of the best American efforts of the time and while all the other kids in school (i was 13 at the time) were talking about the karate kid films I could sit back and laugh at them and their weak-ass idol (Ralph Macchio), knowing that i had seen someone in action who was infinitely more tough and talented. The fight scenes at times are quite brutal (uncut) and are the best i've seen in a Van Damme film so far. There is the usual amount of sentimentality always present in his films but the main focus is on the 'Kumite', a secret full contact event held in Hong Kong. The film is based on a true story but is obviously enhanced for visual effect as is the case in most films of its kind (ie professional fighters standing there watching, wide open, as their opponent winds up a massively telegraphed spinning attack). The movie was practically remade in later years as 'The Quest' and may not stand up technically to the latter but shows what Van Damme could do before he started getting complacent and picking up guns. Fight Fans will probably be happier skipping straight to the action as the acting is pretty poor and the story a bit soppy. Bolo Yeung, one of my favourite bad guys, is suitably menacing and perfectly cast as the reigning champion. All in all a bad, cheesy, but entertaining little film and one that holds a special place in my heart.",Bloodsport
156,bbro3886,Bloodsport still Rocks!!!,8,22 May 2006,"I never grow tired of watching this movie; its one of JCVD (Jean Claude Van Damme's best role. JCVD is regarded by many as a pioneer of martial arts movies along the likes of Bruce Lee, and Chuck Norris. However, each one of this three actors manage to bring their own styles to the table in their own original way.... and that JCVD does very well indeed in Bloodsport. This is the kind of movie people are still going to remember 100 years from now. The movie is about an American fighter who participates in a Japanese fighting tournament. There, the best fighters from around the world meet to decide who is the best. Although its not a great movie by any standards, it delivers great entertainment, some cool songs, and some great fights.

Wide variety of styles, makes me wonder about present movies, that have no martial art style(standing only to street fighting,karate and kung fu styles)those who just shows fancy moves to impress the audience. It's difficult to say if those moves are computer-modified or the real deal.I'm not saying that Bloodsport impress as Hell, but you can easily recognize one art from another(Even by just seeing the person clothes) Although I'm not convinced that Dux(In real Life) made those victories and records in his life, the movie itself is no-plot, but battle-focused.

I love it,9,16 May 2021,"The acting is absolutely horrendous, the characters are one-dimensional, the relationships are under-developed, there are far too many scenes of JCVD doing the splits, the editing is jarring at parts, and the plot is absolutely nonsensical when it is not cliché.And yet... I freaking love this movie. The fight scenes are very well done. The use of actors who are martial artists first, actors second, led to some very organic and impressive action sequences, and in a pre-MMA world, it's pretty cool that various fight styles from around the world were showcased. It's rare you see an 80s action flick with a Karate master trading kicks with a Muay Thai fighter or a Sumo wrestler going at a Capoeira fighter. The hammy lines delivered with wooden acting are unintentionally hilarious, giving this movie plenty of unintentional comedy as padding around it's legitimately impressive fight choreography.Overall, no matter how uneven the film can get, one thing it manages to consistently be is enjoyable.",Bloodsport

164,John_Acrob,Pretty cool fighting but often cringe-worthy.,5,10 May 2007,"There seems to be a trend in films that are supposedly about fighting tournaments, where the actual fighting is secondary to the plot, so much so in some instances that there's barely any fighting at all. That certainly can't be said for Bloodsport. The first twenty minutes of the film build up the plot and cover Frank Dux(Van Damn) who is a marine or something, his childhood and his martial arts training. The rest is mostly hardcore fighting. Mostly.Obviously with a movie like Bloodsport, you have to take the plot with a pinch of salt. Unfortunately for Bloodsport, i didn't have enough salt. As cool as it was to see Forest Whitaker in an early role, his character as a Navy/Army(Dunno?) detective trying to track down Dux in Hong Kong was almost as useless as Dux's love interest, who served to be a massive annoyance. I'm not sure why it's considered necessary to have a love interest who inputs nothing to the film but a brief period of trying to hold the male protagonist back. It's misogynistic and very boring to watch. There were a couple of cheesy montages with cued 80's music(How did they not think it would date?) and some awful dialogue too. I'm not even going to touch on Dux's friendship with fellow fighter and bikie, Ray Jackson(Played by Donald Gibb). WAY bad. I don't mean to sound shallow and or seem like i don't like an engaging plot, but lets be honest, its a poorly scripted, awkwardly acted fight-fest, there's no need for shoddy story lines.Anyway, down to the fighting. It was exceptionally well choreographed, and you can tell that the fighters know what they're doing. Occasionally the punches looked a little soft, and Van Damn's odd wailing gets gets a bit distracting, but it's hard to care much when there's so much fighting going on. The villain was great, but the final confrontation between him and Dux is a tad disappointing.Like i said the acting is downright awkward, especially Van Damn's, he is awful(Though not as awful as the child actor playing his younger self, DAMN!) But then, he's not there for his acting. He's there to look good and fight. On that though, there were a few too many buff shots of Van Damn, his huge muscular body was constantly thrown in your face, as well as a gratuitous shot of Van Damns butt, which made me feel like i was watching gay porn. They could have at least thrown in some breasts, it was the 80's after all! Without giving too much away, for a film called Bloodsport, there just wasn't enough blood. I wanted necks broken and faces crushed. I didn't want half an hour of cheesy music, silly chases, unnecessary love scenes, and male butts shots. But hey, that's just me.Five out of Ten.",Bloodsport

It appears as if the actors are in a real fight and it leaves you breathless with some of the actions.
I rated this movie a 10, because I can never get tired of watching it and it is totally entertaining for any Van Damme or martial arts fan in general.I did find one more goof about the film though, in Chong Li and Paredes' fight, Chong Li wins by breaking Paredes' leg and you see the bone penetrating the skin. Although, after that fight, if you look in the stands you can see Paredes' sitting in the first row with his leg back to normal as if he hadn't even fought earlier.

But, in today's MMA world the fights look pretty darn good and with the exception of the bouncy-guy and the finale with the over-the-top acting, the rest of the fighting rings surprisingly realistic.Bloodsport was VanDamme's first movie and it still holds up as one of his best. I have a soft-spot in my heart for Timecop as well. If you're in the mood for a simple bubblegum movie on a Friday night, then this is a great flashback to the hey-day of 1980s action movies.

Bloodsport was inspiration for a whole generation to start learning martial arts. A Cult movie. I grew up some of my life in Asia and it amuses me to see those buff cliché white men jumping around through colourful, but grubby marketplaces/ back alleys. In fact the whole movie is simple and has even a nice tidy cliché structure: Man starts terribly, improves through tough training and develops into sexy fighting machine. Some people who commented on this movie said he is no Bruce Lee. But that is the beauty of it. He is somebody from a western country trying to measure up and fit into the eastern culture. Good stuff.",Bloodsport
178,fake_plastic_trees_,Look at it like this!!!,9,3 October 2005,"Being a film watcher that looks for great acting, i surprised myself when i enjoyed this film.Being more a film fan than a martial arts fan i was expecting to be writing a bad review for this flick. No one can deny that van damme is a great martial artist, but his acting is so so the opposite.You have to look at it as a martial arts film (which it is) and accept the stunning fight sequences (especially the final fight scene which was very well choreographed) the film offers.Yes, people will talk about how bad his acting may be, but what people forget is that he is a martial artist more than an actor. Movies are just the way he can express his great skills to an audience.I recommend this film to any martial arts fan but not so much to anyone looking for a compelling dramatic, mystical thriller because you will be disappointed.On all it's a basic, pure, martial arts film that i feel is underrated.",Bloodsport

Well guess what, it was good, here's the ultimate test: Imagine if Denzel Washington, or Tom Hanks, etc etc., all regarded as legendary actors, imagine that EVEN IF they got their bodies all chizled up for this movie, they STILL wouldn't have played the roles NEARLY as well as van damme and bolo, in fact they would've been a laughing stock. That's proof that the acting was actually very, very well done.So sick of people saying the acting was bad when nobody could've played those roles any better.It's just like Stallone in Rambo. Gets trashed for bad acting, but it's a goddamn lie, cuz the truth is NOBODY could've played the rambo character better than Stallone !!!So pathetic !!!",Bloodsport

Never duplicated or improved upon.

One of the more memorable of these was ""Bloodsport"" Starring Van-Damme in one of his earliest appearances, this is still without doubt his best film. Ironically, the set up for the film is one that would have suited the terrible ""Streetfighter"" film down to the ground. The film features all of the best cliches of the genre, ""Remember your training"" ""Honor your master"" etc, with all the macho trappings. It may be one dimensional, Ghong Li (A wasted Bolo Yeung, who also appeared in Enter the dragon) is the bad guy, Van-Damme as Dux the honorable hero. The film remains enjoyable thanks to several classic moments, Jean-Claude asserting to Donald Gibb, that he might be ""A little too old for video games"" and the other competitors in the tournament, who are more imaginatively thought out than you might think.",Bloodsport

The action scenes are great, I've watched this movie so many times, that I forget all about his stupid accent and horrible acting. It's just an all around great martial arts movie. It doesn't try to be something intelligent, or have something deep to say. It's just a fight movie. Too many fight movies try to pretend that they have a real plot and end up looking stupid. Blood Sport has a basic story that leaves lots of room for the fight scenes without trying to be smart. If you're a fan of martial art movies, then I highly recommend it.",Bloodsport

Rented this couple days ago and gave it a shot. Wow what a turd. If not for the Ghost Dog himself, I would have gave this 1 star. I think everything about this movie (maybe not the fight sequences. Some of them are fun to watch) is horrendous. The dialogue is so bad you would think they wrote it 10 mins before cameras rolled. This movie is not a comedy and I burst out laughing more times than I can remember. The acting is so so so so bad. Okay it's Van Damm, I know he's no Meryl Streep. But good god man, at least try.

Arnie would be impressed, he makes Jet Li look like a bone. His acting is what you expect but Bolo Yeung (chong Li) is great as the bad guy and at 50 years old not badly done with the shape he is in.

The soundtrack (composed by Paul Hertzog and also Stan Bush) is top quality and the fight choreography is in parts, breathtaking.the scene where Dux (Van Damme) 'solarplexes' his Sumo opponent is jaw-dropping to watch - especially when after-wards he follows it up with a move that would be every guys worst nightmare, ha, and a move which has Chong Li worried . . .What i find interesting about this film is the background of Frank Dux and the dedication he put into his training. Its an inspiring story and is adapted into the film extremely well. I have wondered on occasions however whether Tanaka really did use a hoist as a method of making Dux's legs more supple of whether that was inserted into the story to highlight Jean-Claude Van Dammes talent for doing the splits!anyway its a great movie so watch it!",Bloodsport
194,saico13,Whoa! Damn this movie gets worse every time you watch it!,3,11 January 2006,"OK firstly I'm being generous with that 3 your seeing there. And i'm ashamed that i'm gonna give it that, because just like everyone else, I also indulge in the guilty pleasure of van damme movies. The problem with this film starts off not at the beginning, but once they reach the kumite. Then and only then will you begin to realize the mistake you made watching the 2 o'clock in the morning WGN late night movie. The fight choreography is an atrophy most of the time. Its like watching 2 drugged up apes smash their think tanks together. OK maybe it's not that bad but the lack of skill was as hideous as the one liners.OK I'll be clear on this! I watched this movie about 4 years ago on TV one night, I was about 14 I think and jean claude van-damme was my role model. 4yr's later I watch the movie again and this time I'm anything but delighted. The Only good fights are the ones between van damme and the giant Tibetan freak show, the Spanish boxer Paco and that nerdy looking karate guy, chong li and that lame white kickboxer who gets ownizled, and finally van damme versus Paco. I loved it how they did shot for shot on the runway. People wondering why I excluded the van damme versus chong li match-up, it's simple it was a degradation of the entire movie. There was no attempt to block strikes at all. I wanted to get in there and kick van damme in the marble bag when he was doing that stupid 6 hit kick combination on chong li's face.Overall it's the kumite that truly brings this movie down. The music is great. I loved all the tracks and their arrangement is superb. Kudos to Michael Bishop for his song.Naughty naughty jean claude, no more martial arts spoofs, and shame on you!",Bloodsport

Even though there are so many lies to this ""True story"" inside this movie).I will admit it is enjoyable. I'm 30 years old now and when I was a kid growing up, this movie was awesome. But thats not a good enough reason to give this a 10. The acting is bad (like most 80's martial art movies) and one move (split-kick) Van-Damme is just not that good of a martial artist regardless of what his fan-boys thinks. And sadly enough, this was his best display of it! In reality, we all know Bolo would've destroyed him like he does the rest of his opponents in the movie. But when he gets to Jean Claude, all of a sudden, he can't fight as good or as fast as he did before, LOL. Could this be because he had to slow up significantly so Van Damme could look better? In fact Jean Claude is so slow in this movie that they do double takes and sometimes triple and quadruple takes to make him seem faster. Same with ""Kickboxer"". So lets try to keep IMDb honest as much as we can, but with this ""Fanboy"" generation--I doubt any rate system is honest. 4/10",Bloodsport

I left the videos with her, and when I returned the next day I was surprised to see her cheering along with Van Damme as he was beating the large Asian Man.A few days later, she was walking around and trying to perform some of the stunts she saw in her new favorite movie. I even saw the copy of Fried Green Tomatoes in the trash bin.The next week the Doctor came to me and said he witnessed a miracle. It seems my mother's cancer had disappeared.She checked out of the hospital and told me she had to meet the man who cured her of her wicked disease: Van Damme.So me and my mom set out in a beat up VW Bug and headed towards Hollywood.

The sound track by Paul Hertzog is incredible. The sound track music is not well reproduced on VHS tape and you will need Blu Ray to hear this lovely and inspirational score. I have always loved Kung Fu (the television series) and BloodSport carries on this tradition of discipline and far eastern aesthetics and grace in beautifully choreographed fight sequences... especially in the final match against the defending Kumite world champion Chong Li.I never get tired of watching this film. I have watched it over fifty times and it is as fresh today as it was the day I first saw the film. BloodSport is widely regarded as a cult classic in the genre and will likely remain that way possibly for all time. This is not Titanic nor the Lord of the Rings trilogy... it simply holds it's own as one of the most inspirational movies of all time.

201,piikki84,Classic martial arts movie suffering from some weird mood swings.,8,18 June 2011,"When I saw Bloodsport for the first time, I was pretty amazed. It had intense action scenes and all the things that made a young action movie fan wanting more.Only after 10 years or so when I saw it again, I noticed how weird the movie really is. Basically it is about one man's quest to compete in a secret tournament against the best of the best (and some of the weirdest) fighters around the world. He is fulfilling the last wish of his master by entering the Kumite and fighting to achieve the championship. It is said to be based on the real life events of Frank Dux but I cannot tell how much is actually real and how much is fiction, both in the movie and in the story Dux himself has told. The plot itself is not really complicated or anything too deep but Van Damme gives a good performance as Dux and is mostly very convincing.What 'bothers' me is the odd scenes here and there in the movie: at one point we have this serious fight scene with unsettling music and the next we have Van Damme running away from two military law enforcement agents played by Norman Burton and Forest Whitaker with light-hearted, even comical, music.Also, the female love interest sub-plot is quite irrelevant to the plot as a whole and Leah Ayres serves only to slightly even the scales with the many testosterone-filled fighting machines. I believe she also somewhat blackmails Dux for letting her tag along to get into the Kumite since it is mostly off-limits to regular people. The blackmailing is bewildering to me since she tells Dux that she will tell the agents his whereabouts if he doesn't let her come with him the the tournament and yet the agents already know and/or can locate Dux by themselves rendering the blackmailing pointless and ineffective. But of course, Dux being the gentleman he is, let's her tag along.Bloodsport is enjoyable martial arts movie and it belongs to every fan's must-see list. However, the overall pacing and some scenes take away some of the seriousness of the Kumite that the film no doubt tries to convey through some of the fight scenes and the menacing antagonist.",Bloodsport
202,brownd5,Totally awesome!!! Purchase this DVD immediately!!!,10,28 March 2005,"I love this movie so much more than mere words can possibly hope to express. In fact, this is in my humble opinion THE GREATEST FILM OF ALL TIME. If you disagree, I'd probably hate you anyway so I'll trifle with you not. This movie masterfully conveys the entire spectrum of human emotion in an enjoyable, riveting, and truly inspirational, energy-replete package. You'll be laughing one moment as Frank Dux pulls a fast one on Johnny MP, escaping from the shower stalls in astonishing JCVD fashion, to being somber and concerned the next as Frank gallantly endures the incredibly rigorous training methods of his Shidoshi Tanaka. You will find yourself unsettled on viewing the imposing atmosphere that is the Hong Kong underworld and then suddenly become psyched by the Kumite itself with its age-old, awe inspiring traditions and highly skilled combatants. Another wonderful of the myriad wonderful aspects, are the characters that one can so easily be enamored by. The indomitable Ray Jackson will win you over with his brash, often obtrusive, but usually well-intentioned actions and the loyal bond he and Frank share. Mr. Street Savvy himself, Victor Lin exudes pure confidence and he'll make you feel as though you are part of the Jackson/Dux/Lin team; the good guys! Lastly, the formidable defending Kumite champ Chong Li is an excellent, quintessential antagonist. This man is a blood thirsty, barrel-chested warrior with a black heart and steel will whose cruel actions will elicit your rage. You'll be filled with child-like glee as Frank escapes from the military officials Helmer and Rollins in an all out 80's extravaganza of a chase that ensues throughout the quaint markets and lovely piers of beautiful Hong Kong, set to the ineffably fantastic tune, Steal the Night by Michael Bishop! Exuberance! Nostalgia! A real tear jerker of an anthem! It's just that damn awesome. After viewing this movie you'll go to sleep feeling as though you were meant to wake up and live forever!!! Jean-Claude Van Damme is a real cardiac kid delivering a performance for the ages! This Film truly runs the gamut of excellence!

203,Shriek10124,Classic Action Flick,7,29 July 2005,"Those of us who have grown up through the 80s and 90s know what qualifies for a good action movie. Bloodsport is one of those said action movies, for that is not made for the viewer to dissect characters, acting or even plot(s). Jean Claude Van Damme was considered one of the superstars in the Action/Adventure genre, his acting was sub-par but he always delivered sequences of pure adrenaline rush with his 'round-house' kicks and the patented 'aaahhh' screams as he finished a foe. Bloodsport is not a shoot-em-up action film, those were left to Sly and Arnold, instead it is based on a ""true-story"" of an American, Frank Dux, who involves himself in an underworld martial-arts competition, the Kumite. The movie provides quality action for those who care for these types of films. The acting is faulty but it is not expected to be good. Overall it is a good action movie, and one of the last few since the late 90s to present day has only provided us with CGI scenes involving an abundance of action that can actually only be considered ""unbelievable and lame"".

204,maximbouts,The Finest of its Kind. Pure Entertainment.,10,8 December 2017,"Bloodsport is the best martial arts film ever! It's the finest of its kind. Certainly one of the most entertaining films I've ever seen. It has everything you can ask for and is the best film about competition in my opinion (whether its sports, business, work, personal life etc.). It is highly motivating and uplifting. This film has it all for me: action, comedy, romance, friendship, competition, interesting characters, awesome music, you name it. Pure entertainment! When watching or reviewing a film like Bloodsport, it is important to relax and let go of high expectations and standards set out by professional film critics. Just take it for what it is at face value. It's a martial arts film meant to entertain and excite us. I do not understand what certain people expect from films like these? People coming into it expecting top acting performances and Oscar-quality will be sadly disappointed. These types of films are made to purely entertain and Bloodsport totally delivers. It's proof that a movie doesn't have to be Oscar-worthy to be good. It's not always about acting. If the story and characters are great, it makes the film highly enjoyable. The film is perfectly paced as well. There isn't a single dull scene. Yes, there are tons of clichés, stereotypes, and cheesy moments but that's what it's supposed to be. It's an 80's action flick filled with cheese. The movie does not pretend to be anything else other than a fun-packed action film. For that, I respect it.Van Damme may not be the greatest actor out there but he sure is one of the best movie stars. He is a martial artist first and foremost; not an actor. However, as an action star, he shines. He has a gift at making you care about his character besides showing off his martial talent. You actually feel his pain and want to root for him. He has a way of making you feel sorry for him. I think these are qualities that only the best actors possess so a huge plus for him. Most of his contemporaries (action heroes) definitely did not possess such qualities. The only one who comes close is Stallone in 'Rocky'. Also, Bolo Yeung's 'Chong Li' is arguably the best movie villain ever. Again, he is no actor but he plays his part realistically with natural and raw emotion that is very intense. Keep in mind this guy is a bodybuilder and martial artist who also happened to star in Bruce Lee films. Ohh and how can I forget about those awesome one-liners! The film is filled with them and they are highly memorable. Basically, when you have many people reciting lines from a particular movie, it means the movie did an amazing job! Bloodsport is also an excellent example of how music should be used in movies. The film contains a perfect music to visual relation. One of the best soundtrack's ever! 80's music rocks! Very catchy tunes especially the theme song 'Kumite', which will have you chanting ""kumite, kumite, kumite"" out loud as you root for your favorite fighters. The music in the film creates a unique and dynamic atmosphere hence other films should follow suit.In conclusion, Bloodsport is one of my favorite films growing up and of all-time! You know the movie is good when you are reciting lines, singing songs, and kicking/punching along and well after it's over! I would recommend this film to anyone. Lay back and enjoy! Movie + Music = Masterpiece 10/10",Bloodsport

I was just a kid when I saw it, he was my childhood hero from then on, and I actually started doing Karate for that reason.Even though he's got an heavy accent in this movie, I think his acting is at his best. It is disappointing to see that he hasn't evolved much, besides getting ""Americanized"", incorporating a very shallow artificial persona on-screen. In Bloodsport he seems much more natural, in touch with his true self. Furthermore, he isn't and he can't be funny. It seems like they all try: I wish they'd stick to what they are good at.Bloodsport is just amazing in terms of martial art on film. It will never be better, and van Damme's is just great.

If I remember rightly (I was a little boy then)when the controversy started over his story, photos of martial artists with their heads blacked out were published. They were from a legit Karate Championship.This doesn't matter as far as the film is concerned. The action is fantastic and still hold up after all these years, especially compared to films nowadays training actors for a few months which has lowered the standard of Kungfu/Karate based action. This film was stored away in the studio shelves for a while as I'd seen promo photos years before.

210,alstott36,A Mermorable Classic,7,29 July 2006,"I remember watching this in the 80's as a kid and loving it. After it disappeared for a while I always had fond memories but grew out of these action films as I got older. Until its DVD release I'd forgotten that it was a half decent movie and got to relive old memories. In my opinion its probably the only good movie Van Dam stars in before he was considered an actor. The fight scenes are pretty spectacular for an 80's movie and the plot is predictable but isn't why one watches the film. Its for the villain Chong Li (Bolo Yeung) and he is definitely the bad guy. Bolo Yeung's stage presence and impressive physique is the major standout of the film along with some very fast well camera captured spin kicks by Van Dam. No computer enhancement in those days and i wonder if anyone was hurt whilst filming?Anyway this is my favorite martial arts film of all time (which aren't many) and appears somewhat realistic. Its a short feel good film about the modest guy (Van Dam) who comes out on top, avenging his friend who gets a battering (which he deserved) and despite being handicapped by his opponent (won't give it away) comes out on top.A classic popcorn movie of the 80's that you watch for the fight scenes and something to own for old times sake.",Bloodsport
211,Anaconda81,Good martial arts movie!,8,8 December 2006,"I think this movie is a classic nowadays. It is the first lead role for Van Damme and it shows a little bit in the movie: the production quality in overall is little average. But still this is a good movie, including magical fight moments, music rich in atmosphere and well proceeding story. Van Damme's acting isn't so great but it doesn't have to be for this kind of movie. I think what he loses in acting ability he truly compensates in his martial art skills. I noticed some small similarities and relations to movie Kickboxer. The most interesting of these is that the fighter named Paredes plays the role of Tong Po in Kickboxer, quite different looking in this movie without the make-up of an Asian. Overall a entertaining and good martial arts movie!",Bloodsport
212,trofes,Excellent,10,25 February 2007,"Based on a true story. He really did ""face"" the fights that were displayed in the movie...and since it was made in the 80's, it was portrayed very well and almost down to the last detail...along with being blinded (which he was,) and defeating his enemy. Great movie! The main character of the movie was (at the time of adolescents,) was considered ""semi-retarded"" or ""slow,"" in which they corporate. Training with that boy's father, and becoming physically, but most important mentally, trained were the keys that made this ""young Einstein"" inherit the brilliance of fighting, and ascended into the human psyche. This movie has inspired me in more ways than one.",Bloodsport
213,BigDonko,Awesome!!,10,4 September 2015,"Bloodsport is an absolute classic, bare in mind i was only born in 1987 so i didn't see this film probably until the late 90s. yes the camera work and some of the acting isn't fantastic but its what you would expect from an 80s film. I think back to my childhood and i think of only a few films that stick in my head, this is top of the pile. Jean claude van damme sells his role very well, and Chong Li the villain in this film is really ""believable"" in that role, frightening man with probably the biggest pecks i have ever seen! Based on a true story makes the film even better. Anything with JCVD in from 80s and early 90s are absolute classics!! 10/10!!",Bloodsport
214,mitch_gladney,Van Damme is the best!,10,26 December 2003,"This movie is amazing. Anyone who says it isn't good wasn't watching this movie. It is full of excitement, and there is never a dull moment. It is a perfect film for Van Damme to showcase his amazing martial art skills. There should have never been sequels to this film. I am glad Van Damme didn't sell out and make the 3 following, terrible, sequels. This should have a lot higher rating and I encourage you to vote fair, and don't just give it a 1 if you don't like Van Damme. This film at least deserves an 8, I give it a 10",Bloodsport
215,glown,A Perfect Classic Martial Arts Movie!!!,10,10 October 2002,"One of Jean Claude's Best films, you should really see this movie!! It has a great story, some humor & lots of action & blood. A must see for anyone who likes action movies. Jean Claude is set out to honor his trainer & succeeds.",Bloodsport
216,leesemic,Best movie of all time,10,24 February 2009,"The only movie which compares in terms of acting quality, plot, casting, and martial arts is Kickboxer, Van Damme's other blockbuster hit.Everybody on here who says that anything about this movie sucks is just player hating. Van Damme is awesome, and there is no other movie I would rather watch on any day of the week.The acting, the music, the characters, everything is awesome - they just don't make movies like this anymore. This movie was so good that they even tried to remake it by making Kickboxer...the only thing I can say that sucks about this movie is that van Damme didn't make 10 more just like it.",Bloodsport
217,shadowofaman2003,"""THIS MOVIE ROCKS""",10,23 November 2004,"""THIS MOVIE ROCKS"" its based on the true life of Frank Dux, thats the plot and thats the character. This movie has a plot, and its has characters and it has emotions. The girl for example, Janice she tries to stop the kumite because she doesn't want Frank to get hurt. And the emotions in between Janice and Frank, and Frank and Ray. Their best friends. This movie is pure its has everything. Love, passion, friendship, honor and blood. The kumite was a war zone waiting to be ruled. And Frank Dux ruled it. I thought the cast was perfect. Jean-Claude Van Damme's biggest debut. His best picture. I wish that Van Damme would come back to that passion and once again rule it. I loved Bloodsport and its one of my favirote movies. It has a lot of martial arts and different styles. One of the biggest martial arts movies ever besides Bruce Lee's Enter the Dragon.... IF your not a huge martial arts fan or Van Damme fan then you might not like this movie. But my opinion is that Its good and its true....",Bloodsport
218,eran-borovik,Unbelievably wonderful,10,7 June 2010,"This movie is one of those rarities where everything just fits together. The best thing is that it is still an enjoyable view even after so many years. Every actor, while limited in his ""acting"" ability (as if that matters to this kind of film) performs wonderfully within his expected role. The hero is great (JCVD), the sidekick is unbelievably amusing (Jackson), and the bad guy. Well, I can only say that this is the best bad guy in recorded history. Seeing JCVD in the ring, is like looking at a dancer performing his routine, very reminiscent to Bruce Lee in ""Fist of Fury"" when he is in the ring with like 20 Japanese karate dudes. You know it ain't real, and that the moves worth nothing in real life, but you still enjoy it tremendously. Add to that the incredible music that backs the fights and you got yourself something that you can keep watching and never get tired of. As a boy, I totally loved the movie, and probably watched it at least 20 times. Roll forward 8 years, I watched this movie as a soldier and it was still unbelievably great. Roll forward present day: I accidentally watched bloodsport II and said to myself: ""Boy, this is crap, the first one was way better"", and just to prove the point I watched it again, this time with my wife!! Well, my wife didn't really approve, but she liked the Persian prince so I don't think her opinion counts..., but for me, it was still an amazing movie. I strongly recommend to anyone who likes martial arts films, and especially to the guys who are tired of all the stunts and computer ""enhancement"" that one can get in ""modern"" martial arts film. Enjoy!! I know I will next time I see it (Perhaps with my children...)",Bloodsport
219,boodness,Mysterious cat?!?!,6,26 June 2005,"Hi! I was watching Bloodsport yesterday when I discovered something a little odd. Please tell me, did anyone notice the sound of a cat Meowing during the fight scenes in the Kumitae (sp?) ??? When I was watching it yesterday on TV, and I thought a strange cat got into my apartment. It turned out the cat sound stopped when the fighting stopped (or so it seemed). OK, I know the production values were nothing special, and the voice used for Chong Li was probably the same voice that was used for Arnold in his Hercules movie, But a cat?! If nobody noticed, then maybe I'd better start looking for a stiff furry carcas somewhere around my home...yikes!Please help me to restore my sanity!",Bloodsport
220,bosundave121,"Most memorable and iconic martial art characters, ever.",7,17 October 2021,"Yes, 6.8 to a 7.0, that is being generous. Still, it is my favorite Van Damn film. And it is watchable over and over again every few years. Timeless characters. You can not forget them. Classic Van Damme at his peak level of physical fitness. Great 80's musical score. 1980's was a GREAT decade for entertaining films that hold up over time. Those films represent a time when many of us were also young and good looking... way back then.",Bloodsport
221,lee_3033,Positive comment on the film 'Bloodsport',8,18 July 2004,"Bloodsport only gets 5.7 outta 10 :-oThis really is an amazing film, i remember many happy times watching this film with cousins and wot great times they were, watching Bloodsport. I bought 'Bloodsport 2' on DVD, and only realized when i put the film on that it wasn't Van-damme! :-o i was shocked, and disappointed that they had, in my view, ruined the film by replacing Jean Claude van-damme with a cheap look-alike! If i would have know this before i bought the DVD then maybe i would of had second forts.Any well to sum the original Bloodsport up, its a GREAT fighting film and a pleasure to watch. If your into fighting films, then you would of most probably seen this! However, if your not, then maybe you haven't already seen it, but you should!Thanks, Lee 19/07/04",Bloodsport
222,Melagan,A Great Martial Arts Film,10,26 May 2004,"While the acting might not be quite up to par compared to the great films of our era, this film is solidly supported by great fight choreography (by the real Frank Dux even), a fine story, and good music. This, in my opinion, is one of the best martial arts films because it is ABOUT fighting, rather than about a cool fighter who is on some mission ""to save the girl"". If you like this movie, I'd strongly recommend Kick Boxer and Best of the Best as well (see Julia Robert's brother Eric in some cool fight scenes).I'd really love to see Van Damm do another movie that showed his character grow as a fighter.",Bloodsport
223,kumitefanatic,The best movie ever!!!,10,2 June 2004,"This Movie is still my favourite to this day. JCVD gives one of his best performances in this movie. His Fighting style is excellent (with Frank Dux as a personal assistant throughout the film, who wouldn't look that graceful) he is very young and knows how to play the part. Bolo Yeung also makes this film special. I think together, those two make a great good-guy bad-guy scenario and i can't wait for Kumite to be released next year. All the fighting scenes are 10/10 everytime and i recommend this film to anyone who likes Van Damme or his movies. Also, I think that Sumo guy vs. Van Damme fight was pretty good too. Mortal Kombat video game ripped off JCVD's finishing move on the sumo. Remember Johnny Cage's splits punch?? Go JCVD and many more movies to come. Good Luck!!",Bloodsport
224,Josef_thaking,One of the best fighting movies ever!,10,23 May 2007,"Bloodsport is the second movie with Jean-Claude Van Damme in a lead role. In this movie he is playing Frank Dux and its based on a true story. Frank Dux travels to hongkong to fight in the kumite even without permition from the U.S army. In hongkong Frank meets Ray Jackson, a American fighter who will fight in the kumite and he becomes friends with him. But to prove that he is a shidoshi, he has to show the judges the dim-mak also known as the death touch. This movie who is based on a true story has everything if you ask me. Jean-Claude Van Damme is brilliant as Frank Dux and we also see Forest Withtaker(who won a academy award prize 18 years later) in a small role as Rawlins. The music who is made by Paul Hertzog, Michael Bishop and 2 songs performed by Stan Bush is amazing. I give this movie 9/10.",Bloodsport
225,kevinlangston12,Best damn Van Damne movie!!,10,5 October 2019,"Awesome soundtrack, great fighting. I love a scene where an actor gets kicked and reacts the opposite direction flow should've taken him.Still amazing movie, despite if the real Frank Dux is legit or not.",Bloodsport
226,woodythekid,Classic!,10,26 December 2004,"I've seen this movie so many times I have all the lines memorized and for a girl that's saying a bunch! I love Jean-Claude as is and that's what made me watch the movie when I was just 12 yrs. old, but the movies subtle humor and great fight scenes keep me watching it at 27. 8)It's just a classic action movie. Bloodsport was based on a true story so that adds some appeal as well. The movies gives you stats from Frank Dux at the end which is interesting and you grow to appreciate the craft and the different fighting styles of all the fighters in the match. I had no idea there were so many different types/styles of martial arts and just flat out street fighting and watching the fighters use their different tactics was very entertaining. Watch it and try not to be looking for an Oscar performance while doing so..just sit back and let yourself be entertained. Some of the best movies were those gone unnoticed by the masses! 8)",Bloodsport
227,dinkensd,One of the best Martial Art film Ever,10,15 June 2019,I just don't understand how these critics can rate such a classic in this manner. Had people listen to you guys all these years many symbolic and classic movies and actors would of never become iconic. SMH,Bloodsport
228,chunkreloaded,This movie will change your life...,10,27 April 2006,"You don't have to be Japanese, you don't even have to be a Tanaka to love this film! In fact, I don't know if it's a film so much as it is a lifestyle. By watching this movie nearly a hundred times, I have become an expert in every major world fighting technique. You can do the same, you just need buy the DVD..or Laserdisc...or VHS, maybe all three. This movie, er, I mean lifestyle, cannot even be described by a particular genre. It's action, romance, comedy, martial science, biographical, historical fact, and a religious experience. If you desire to fight in the Kumite and make your father proud, this is the movie for you. OKAY USA!",Bloodsport
229,kzero70,still retains its cult status...,8,16 April 2007,"As you'd expect, the acting is B-movie quality and the plot is primitive, but I'd go as far as to say that it's the quintessential domestic martial arts movie of the 80's. Decently choreographed fight scenes combined with the atmosphere and soundtrack really set the tone for this film. It may feel a bit outdated in comparison to martial art films now, but it holds well and still retains its cult status. I've seen this film a countless number of times and it is still very enjoyable to this day. Hollywood attempted to cash in on a sequential project (The Quest) also starring van damme but it couldn't capture the 'magic' nor achieve the same success. A must watch for all of you martial arts buff. The grand showcasing of the various fighting styles is truly the centerpiece. This is Van Damme at his absolute prime.",Bloodsport

231,retsirhc_89,Bloodsport,10,12 January 2006,"I like this movie very good. I have seen it about 20 times at least. I like the fights. I also like the training, and how he is preparing to the battles. I think they do well to do the people who watch the movie to be angry on Bolo Yeung, you feel very much of Van Dammes situation and you get very glad when Van Damme finally win. Today I not think that they has the same fighting spirit who they had on that time and the Bruce Lee time. I have a dream to act i a movie some time in my life, in an action movie. Jean Claude Van Damme is my favorite actor and my big idol. I am impressed that Van Damme can have so much power and also have so good skill and speed.",Bloodsport
232,matt-geistfeld,Terrible.....even the martial arts is bad,2,13 March 2006,"I can't find a movie that could better depict the worst movie making in the world. Even an Ed Wood movie is better at its worst then Bloodsports. I actually have to use ten lines to describe how bad this movie is. The fact that it is so outrageously unrealistic and the martial arts so patheically....well pathetic, is only cracking the surface of how bad this movie is. Said to be a man's movie.....only a man who can find nothing but an unworthy, terrible action movie would watch this instead. While respect must be given to Jean in other movies I must try hard and harder to forgive him for such a weak attempt in trying to bring martial arts to the big screen. Thank goodness he has improved.",Bloodsport

In fact it is superb!Quality fight sequences in slow mo mixed with 80's music and Ledgend Jean Claude Van Damn. If you come out of this film not liking it, well there is only one thing that can be said. NEXT. Watching this will bring back memory's of such classics as Aliens, Juarissic Park, Friday the Thirteenth and Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. What more could you want. I repeat slow motion kung fu, cheesy lines, Jean Claude(who deserves an Oscar for yet another top quality performance), 80's music, and more immense Kung fu. Watch it.",Bloodsport

The fight scenes are incredible backed up with a good soundtrack. Bolo plays the bad guy with a lot of menace despite literally only having three lines in the whole movie. I've seen this movie so many times and still love it.,Bloodsport
