0,TheLittleSongbird,On the rampage,4,10 August 2018,"Dwayne Johnson may not be the greatest of actors but he is a very likeable and charismatic guy. The advertising and concept of 'Rampage' gave the sense that there was potential for a turn-brain-off-at-the-door fun film, and the kind of film 'Rampage' was a type that has been enjoyed on a number of occasions by me regardless of its mixed to negative critical reception.For the record, while often being on the same page as critics and general consensus (a minority opinion here, critics these days seem to always treated with condescending scorn by many), that doesn't mean that there have not been times where my opinion has gone against the grain while understanding where they are coming from either in their appraisals or their criticisms. Judging it with an open mind and with a want to like it, unfortunately do have to agree with the general consensus here.'Rampage' is not a complete mess. Johnson is as likeable and charismatic as ever and George is a spectacularly designed creation that has both menace and soul. The chemistry and relationship between the two is where 'Rampage' in terms of characterisation and interaction is most successful. The film is well made and the barnstorming and exciting action sequences are as impressive as the special effects. Jeffrey Dean Morgan has fun in his shadowy role.However, the rest of the cast don't work. Naomie Harris is a blank in a just there sort of role with nothing to it. Coming off worst are Malin Akerman and Jake Lacy, portraying their clichéd cartoonish roles with more ham than a gammon dinner, Lacy in particular. Everybody else is lost amidst the rest of the film, in a film over reliant on explosions and destructions that heart, fun and brains are sacrificed. Johnson and George's characters and interaction aside, the characters are shallow clichés that one has seen before so many times and sadly none of them are interesting. The villains have no menace or intrigue and more like obnoxious cartoons. The story is lacking outside of the action, the excitement goes and becomes dull, silly and predictable, with an ending that is both overblown and ridiculous. The worst asset is the script, which consists of absolutely atrocious dialogue and an overload of exposition that adds little and written clunkily.Overall, has moments but messy. 4/10 Bethany Cox",Rampage
1,Leofwine_draca,A fun rollercoaster ride,7,12 January 2020,"I admit to coming to this film having played the old video game around 30 years ago - not in its arcade incarnation, but on my ancient home computer system as a kid. It translates well to the screen as a pseudo GODZILLA type movie, but ironically it manages to be better than both the recent GODZILLAs. Why? Because it's more fun.Dwayne Johnson is another winning presence as the star of the show and manages to be larger than life than even the plus-size special effects. His presence adds a star to the rating alone, which is often the case. The story is fast paced and action packed, full of set pieces and CGI effects; it's all entirely predictable as it transpires, but at least it's never boring.Cast-wise, you get Naomie Harris acquitting herself well as the intelligent female lead and Jeffrey Dean Morgan reprising his wisecracking Negan role from THE WALKING DEAD. Sure, some of the writing is a little juvenile and some of the supporting players a little over the top (well, a lot) but overall this works a treat as a fun, cinematic rollercoaster ride.",Rampage
2,SnoopyStyle,George and The Rock,5,25 June 2018,"Wildlife expert Davis Okoye (Dwayne Johnson) has a bond with the smart albino gorilla George. George finds a canister from a destroyed space station. It's part of a genetic experiment and George starts to grow violent. It's an evil scheme by CEO Claire Wyden (Malin Åkerman) and her lackey brother Brett (Jake Lacy). Scientist Dr. Kate Caldwell (Naomie Harris) had been fired and teams up with Davis. Davis saves the life of agent Harvey Russell (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) after George crashes their plane.The plot is a mess and the Rock doesn't really have a partner other than George. The city destruct-o-rama is fine but it's nothing new. It's all been done before. It's strange to say that the Rock's most human connection is with a gorilla. Naomie is a blank. JDM is doing a non-evil Negan. Malin is twisting her evil moustache but I don't know how her plan works. It starts from the opening action. It should be Davis battling poachers but it's some convoluted space action. The astronaut is a nobody and then she dies. Certainly, I see the desperate writers trying to make sense of a non-sense video game but that doesn't excuse a bad job.",Rampage
3,Prismark10,The wolf can fly,6,18 June 2018,"Rampage is an unpretentious fun popcorn film. It is worth it just to see a three way fight between a DNA altered Gorilla, Wolf (who can fly) and an Alligator.Dwayne Johnson is primatologist Davis Okoye. He is also ex special forces and he once saved an albino silverback gorilla George when it was a baby out in the wild as its mother was slaughtered by game hunters.When some highly sensitive and dangerous samples that are experimented up in space land on earth, the infected animals grow in size and mutate.George mutates, he grows in size and strength and heads for Chicago with the others because of a single transmitted by the corporate villains who are conducting the illegal experiments. Davis helped by a genetic engineer Dr Kate Caldwell (Naomie Harris) need to track down an antidote to control George and stop the rampage which is destroying Chicago.The film has shades of King Kong and Godzilla. The villains who are siblings are rather cartoonish but Malin Akerman seems to be having fun. It is not a deep film, the script is not great but it is a mindless, cheesy and enjoyable film with plenty of mayhem.",Rampage
4,claudio_carvalho,Brainless Entertainment,6,8 July 2018,"""Rampage"" is one of those brainless entertainments full of clichés, plot holes and corny and terrible storyline. But if you have nothing to do and wants to spend your leisure time having fun and eating popcorns, ""Rampage"" is recommended. The viewer will see the hot Malin Akerman, will recall Negan and will laugh with a white King Kong replica destroying a monster not affected by four missiles on its head with a steel bar through its eye. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""Rampage: Destruição Total"" (""Rampage: Total Destruction"")",Rampage
5,nogodnomasters,I have been to Uganda and Hogswart.,8,23 April 2018,"Dwayne Johnson teams up with Naomie Harris to save Chicago from giant, bullet resistant ape, wolf, and gator. We get the King Kong climb the building flashback as well as King Kong vs Godzilla. The film is made with kids or tweens in mind. Dwayne Johnson provides us with the same strong and humorous character we have come to known, but make no mistake, the George, the ape, had the best laughs with his sign language. Jeffrey Dean Morgan gave us a likable spook. Very cliche film. The CG was good. In the initial outer space scene, I appreciated that they went out of their way to create a weightless environment. So many film makers don't bother. Worth watching. Action, drama, and laughs. Guide: Some obscene gestures made by George.",Rampage
6,kosmasp,Expectations,6,31 August 2018,"What do you really expect from a movie like this? If you set really high standards you will more than likely be dissapointed. This is a fun ride, with a CG ape and his best bud (no bad jokes, I'm referring to The Rock as the best bud not any of the other CG creatures). The Rock is his usual charismatic self and his relationship with the big Ape works quite nicely.You may actually be touched and shed a tear or two, so mission accomplished in that regard. A lot of mayhem occurs after an initial lets get to learn these characters. And you also have Jeffrey Dean Morgan who relishes in the campiness of this movie. No one can tell me he didn't have the time of his life with this. So sit back and enjoy if possible",Rampage
7,classicsoncall,"""Of course..., the wolf flies.""",7,22 April 2018,"I was just about ready for another giant monkey flick and along comes ""Rampage"" to fill the bill. The film isn't going to win any awards except maybe a Razzie, but if you're up for the ultimate in destructive monster action, you've come to the right place. The 'Rock', Dwayne Johnson stars as primatologist Davis Okoye, opposite his friendly neighborhood albino silverback gorilla George, who's infected by a runaway genetic experiment that also wreaks havoc with a Montana wolf and an Everglades alligator. The animals suddenly begin growing at an alarming rate while at the same time becoming proportionally more aggressive and hostile. The giant gorilla and wolf were okay I guess but I had some trouble with that alligator, if that's what it was supposed to be. It had scales and protuberances that made it look like some kind of mutated freak; the picture might just as well have come up with some rationale to make it a dinosaur.When the mega-monsters react to a homing beacon of some sort, they make tracks for Chicago in an ultimate showdown with all the forces the city can bring to bear against them. I lost track of the point at which giant George becomes responsive once again to his former friend and master Davis, but he suddenly turns tail and goes up against the other two behemoths in a knock down, drag out that takes out a good chunk of the city. In that regard, the picture becomes the next installment in a whole series of pictures in which this latest tries to outdo all the ones that went before in terms of massive violence and destruction. I always wonder about that you know, because really, who's ever called to account for all the dead bodies that one has to presume are left in the wake of all those smashed buildings and vehicles. Not to mention cleaning up the mess. Sheesh!If there's such a thing as a favorite scene here, I'd have to go with that outrageous moment when killer George made an hors d'oeuvre out of the villain from Energene, Claire Wyden (Malin Akerman). There has to be some Freudian symbolism there but I hazard to guess what that was. Before seeing this picture, I'd never seen Jeffrey Dean Morgan before. To me, he had kind of a Robert Downey Jr./Tony Stark look and vibe going for him which I didn't care for. If you think about it, with everything going on across the expanse of the city with the monsters on the loose, how is it that Russell (Morgan), Okoye, Kate Caldwell (Naomie Harris) and George all wind up together again at the finale? Then again, maybe that's the point. Just like with the rest of the movie, you're really not expected to think about it too much.",Rampage
8,BA_Harrison,Just another day at the office for The Rock.,6,23 July 2018,"Rampage is further proof, as if any were needed, that Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson is no mere mortal: not only is he indestructible, super strong, blessed with incredible good luck and, as I recently learned in Skyscraper, able to leap from a crane to a burning building with only one leg, he is also able to talk to the animals. In Rampage, he plays primatologist Davis Okoye, who holds deep and meaningful conversations with George, the albino gorilla he looks after at the San Diego wildlife reserve.This ability to converse with the big ape comes in useful when George, along with a wolf and an alligator, are accidentally exposed to a pathogen (secretly developed in outer space by evil corporate types) that causes the animals to mutate. Growing to massive proportions and becoming much more aggressive, the three creatures cause havoc in Chicago, but when George is fed an antidote, Davis is able to talk the gigantic gorilla into helping him defeat the other two beasts.As buildings are smashed and people smushed, Davis somehow narrowly avoids death at every turn, even riding a collapsing skyscraper to the ground inside a damaged helicopter. Also miraculously surviving the carnage is geneticist Dr. Kate Caldwell (Naomie Harris), who aids Davis and George in dealing with the bad guys. As has been the case with the last three Dwayne Johnson films that I have watched (Fast 5, Furious 6 and Skyscraper), the action is utterly predictable, totally preposterous, but still mindlessly entertaining popcorn nonsense, perfect for when you just want to switch off your brain and enjoy maximum destruction with zero concern for logic.",Rampage
9,paul_haakonsen,Bring it on...,6,7 June 2018,"I went in to watch this movie with absolute no expectations, except that this was a game that I used to play on the Commodore 64 in my childhood. So I thought there would be very little substance to the movie aside from a galore of special effects. But after all, Dwayne Johnson was in it so it had potential for a decent action movie.It turned out that ""Rampage"" was much more than just an action movie with pretty special effects. It was actually a blast to sit down and watch George, Lizzie and Ralph go on a wanton destruction in a metropolis.And of course there was an Easter egg with a Rampage arcade machine to be seen in the movie as well. I will not tell you where or when, but I did spot it.The special effects in the movie were quite simply amazing and they really carried the movie so well. There was also a good amount of great humor in the movie, as there tend to be in the movies that Dwayne Johnson is in.It was hard not to take an instant liking to George.""Rampage"" turned out to be a great action thrill ride and definitely well worth the time and money.",Rampage
10,tavm,Rampage has the thrills and The Rock to make this one of the most exciting of the action-creature features of this year!,9,10 May 2018,"I had originally had hoped to watch Blockers today but after my movie theatre-working friend said that left, I picked this one instead. Verdict: This was quite a massively enjoyable throwback to the kinds of movies made back decades ago in which giant monsters attack a Big City and it's up to Our Heroes to make sure they get defeated. There's humor, action, and some occasional drama to make this one of the most entertaining movies of this year, that's for sure. And Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson is a good enough leading man to guide us through it. So on that note, me and my friend highly recommend Rampage.",Rampage
11,BandSAboutMovies,My inner child loved it!,8,19 July 2018,"I was shopping at The Exchange - it's a used DVD store you can find in both the Pittsburgh and Cleveland areas - and I was listening to a kid excitedly describe a movie to his dad, breathlessly detailing how a space station crashes and all these boxes fall into zoos and game preserves and how regular animals become so big that he couldn't even figure out how big they are. It sounded like the best movie ever made, because it was being remixed through the brains of a ten-year-old. So that's exactly how I approached the movie, deciding that instead of being critical, I should just remember how I felt watching movies like Destroy All Monsters.Rampage is big, dumb, loud and silly. Guess what? It's also exactly what it should be - a giant monster movie based on a video game starring The Rock. If you are expecting Truffaut, get the hell off my website.
Directed by Brad Peyton, who also worked on Dwayne Johnson's films Journey 2: The Mysterious Island and San Andreas, this is a fast-moving slam-bang action fest. And if you're looking to shut your brain off and just watch giant monsters decimate cities and one another, good news. It's exactly that.The Athena-1 space station - owned by the evil gene company Energyne - is being destroyed by mutant rats when one lone doctor manages to get research canisters back onto Earth, where they crash land into the swamps of the Everglades, the forests of Wyoming and the San Diego Wildlife Sanctuary.That's where primatologist Davis Okoye (Dwayne Johnson) works. He's a former US Army Special Forces black ops soldier whose record is filled with redacted missions and was also part of an elite anti-poaching unit. If you're saying - but wait these things seem quite ridiculous - of course they do. Certainly you can be all these things and more, also able to speak to gorillas and have an albino one named George as your best friend. It's The Rock - if he wants his character to be able to juggle thunder and fart fire, just let him.George ends up finding one of those samples and begins to grow, just as the other two creatures - a giant crocodile and a wolf - do the same. The bad guys lure them to Chicago with a sonic beacon, all hell breaks loose, the US Army obviously screws things up and only a rogue government agent (played by Jeffrey Dean Morgan as if he's having the most fun ever), The Rock and a scientist (Naomie Harris, The Pirates of the Carribean films and Moneypenny in Skyfall and Spectre) can save the day.If watching a team of mercenaries battle a giant wolf that can shoot quills and fly seems like your idea of a good time, well, here you go.It's packed with product placements, like the Bronco that The Rock drives (it's actually an unreleased 2004 concept car) and a Dave and Buster's being destroyed - look for Rampage: City Smash to play when you're there! - but again, I gave this movie the widest of berths.If you were ten years old again, wasn't this what you'd want to see? The Rock armed with a grenade launcher teaming up with a white gorilla as he battles a real life dragon? Don't lie. You totally would.",Rampage
12,michaelRokeefe,Popcorn movie at beast...I mean best,7,11 September 2018,"Dwayne Johnson stars as Davis Okoye, a primatologist, that raises a silverback gorilla, only to see it become infected, when a rogue experiment goes wrong. The albino gorilla named George along with a wolf and an American crocodile turn into gigantic raging creatures on the prowl and ready to destroy the city of Chicago. In order to save George and a large section of humanity, Okoye must team up with a genetic engineer to discover an antidote. This doesn't require thinking; just the ability to pack away a lot of popcorn and soda. Super F/X and plenty of action. Even some physical humor to keep you amused. Rounding out the cast: Naomie Harris, Malin Akerman, Joe Manganiello, Jake Lacy, Jack Quaid, Jeffery Dean Morgan and Marley Shelton.",Rampage
13,CinemaSerf,George got more curious...and angry...and huge...,5,18 June 2020,"Dwayne Johnson is one of those performers who can - usually - carry a film along just by being him; the brute strength, caring cheekiness, one-gear acting - but not here, this is just one big beastie-thriller too far. His favourite white gorilla ""George"" accidentally becomes infected with an hormone that makes him grow bigger, more powerful and uncharacteristically for him - more destructive. When he escapes from the glorified zoo in which he lives and allies with a similarly affected (giant) wolf and finally a creature from the depths all hell bent on destroying downtown Chicago - we have an huge undertaking for our Primatologist (who knew there was such a thing) and Naomie Harris (""Kate"") who formerly worked for the company that developed this all conquering virus in a bid to stop the carnage and save poor old ""George"". It has more endings than an Elton John retirement tour and culminates, eventually, in a CGI fest that left me cold and bored...",Rampage
14,zardoz-13,"The Rock Versus A Giant Gorilla, A Huge Wolf, and A Prodigious Alligator!!!",8,2 May 2018,"If you didn't get your fill of colossal robots and chimerical lizards toppling Tokyo skyscrapers in ""Pacific Rim Uprising,"" you can find something similar in the predictable but winsome sci-fi, creature feature ""Rampage"" where a gargantuan gorilla, a 30-foot wolf, and a leviathan-shaped alligator flatten Chicago. Based loosely on Bally Midway's 1986 video arcade game, this $120-million, Warner Brothers/New Line Cinema release qualifies as a big, dumb, demolition derby with sterling CGI galore. Outrageously outlandish in every respect, this far-fetched fable benefits from the charisma of lead actor Dewayne Johnson and supporting star Jeffrey Dean Morgan. Johnson's commanding presence is literally 'the Rock' that allows us to treat ""Rampage"" as something more than just another paint-by-the-numbers extravaganza. Johnson plays a primatologist who uses sign language to converse with a rare albino gorilla. Morgan is cast as a good ole' boy government trouble shooter. As arch-villainess Claire Wyden, Malin Akerman infuriates these two, and she shows no qualms about genetic editing in lifeforms. Owner of a billion-dollar biotech company, Wyden breaks the law without a qualm for her forbidden genetics experiments. No, Marvel Studios isn't the only company that has exploited genetic mutation to pump up their plots. As this deafening, melodramatic, nonsense approaches its climax, the city of Chicago suffers another apocalypse like that in director Michael Bay's ""Transformers: Dark of The Moon."" British actress Naomie Harris rounds out the cast as one of Claire's disgraced researchers. 
 
""Rampage"" opens in outer space on the Wyden space station Athena-1 where experiments have been performed on lab rats. As the action unfolds, alarms throughout the space station send one technician, Dr. Kerry Atkins (Marley Shelton of ""Planet Terror""), scrambling desperately for an escape pod. A mutant rat that appears to be the size of a wild boar pursues her. Claire Wyden locks down the mechanism which enables Atkins to open the door to the escape pod hatch. While a succession of fireball explosions rocks Athena-1, Claire orders Atkins to retrieve several canisters holding a pathogen known as CRISPR. According to the film's preface: CRISPR is ""a breakthrough new technology"" used by scientists to ""treat incurable diseases through genetic editing."" If she refuses to obey Claire's demands, Atkins will die aboard the disintegrating platform. Although Atkins salvages enough canisters, the rat shatters the window in the escape pod door before it jettisons itself. The craft explodes along with the space station. Fortunately, for Claire, the canisters survive the deep-freeze temperatures of space, plunge through the atmosphere, and crash in different parts of the United States. 
At the San Diego Wildlife Preserve, an albino gorilla named George is the first animal to confront this pathogen. George has been raised from infancy by muscle-bound primate specialist Davis Okoye (Dwayne Johnson of ""Baywatch""), who rescued him from poachers that slaughtered his mom. Of course, Okoye is no ordinary primatologist. He has served in the U.S. Army Special Forces, knows how to wield weapons of any kind, and can fly a helicopter. George grows several times his normal size, demolishes his enclosure, and is poised to flee when a mysterious chopper hovers nearby. A swarm of tranquilizer darts knock him off his knuckles. No sooner has George collapsed than troops load him onto a military transport plane. Former Wyden genetic engineer Dr. Kate Caldwell (Naomie Harris of ""Skyfall""), who had rushed to the wildlife preserve after learning about George, finds herself in the custody of OGA Agent Harvey Russell (Jeffrey Dean Morgan of ""Watchmen"") along with Okoye. Russell reveals to Okoye that Claire Wyden fired Caldwell, and the former Wyden scientist served time in prison. Okoye and Caldwell warn Russell that none of his safeguards will prevent George from escaping from the transport plane.
 
While George, Davis, and Dr. Caldwell are in flight, two other beasts encounter CRISPR canisters. The second is a timber wolf that grows large enough to snag a helicopter in its jaws and destroy it. This savage animal chews up a squad of heavily-armed mercenaries dispatched by Claire to trap it. The last canister splashes down in the Everglades, and a random alligator crunches it. Eventually, the gator swells to the size of a ""Jurassic Park"" dinosaur. Shrewdly, Claire has devised a means to summon these genetic mutations to her laboratories in the company's Chicago, Illinois skyscraper. George awakens in flight, destroys the transport plane, but miraculously survives the crash. Like Tom Cruise and his leading lady in last summer's horror adventure ""The Mummy,"" Davis and Caldwell seize parachutes and bail open, too. Now, George and the wolf are scrambling to Chicago as well as the mutated gator.
 
""Rampage"" marks the third collaboration between director Brad Peyton and Johnson. Earlier, they made ""Journey 2: The Mysterious Island"" (2012) and then ""San Andreas"" (2015). If you've seen any of the recent alien invasion epics or Godzilla sagas, you can figure out easily what follows next in this rambunctious tale. Naturally, the military responds with enough firepower to blast Chicago to kingdom come. The trouble is, nothing slows down this indestructible trio. Meantime, the FBI raid Claire's offices, but she cooperates. Unbeknownst to Uncle Sam, Claire has cleverly concealed her top-secret files. She gets the surprise of her life when this monstrous trio wreaks havoc in the Windy City and scales her skyscraper to silence her homing beacon. Dr. Caldwell and Davis aren't far behind Wyden, and Caldwell locates the antidote that will save George.
 
Dewayne Johnson compensates for all the ersatz, 'what-if' science fiction nonsense with his affable personality. You'll have more fun watching the Hawaiian hulk than the imposing monsters. You'll appreciate Johnson's compassionate friendship with George that director Brad Peyton amplifies with comedy before disaster strikes. Their friendship reminded me of the classic 1933 ""King Kong"" sequel ""The Son of Kong."" Unlike the other two mutated monsters, George never seems as pitiless and predatory. The CGI effects are virtually flawless, so the mutated alligator and the Tex Avery timber wolf appear sufficiently menacing. ""Rampage"" ranks as rip-snorting enjoyment.",Rampage
15,Calicodreamin,"Not bad, but not great",5,4 June 2020,"A fairly well rounded cast, with some big names, means the characters are well acted. The plot is fairly well developed, the ending is a bit abrupt. The cgi is well done, the gorilla especially. But it's all just a bit too hokey.",Rampage
16,oscaralbert,Exactly WHO are the three threats which the eponymous Warner Bros. film studio . . .,8,23 April 2018,". . . are warning America against with the monstrous mad dog, the reptilian behemoth, and the girl-gobbling gorilla of RAMPAGE? Unlike the products of the other major Hollywood movie makers, Warner's always clairvoyant prophets inevitably are telegraphing viewers about some upcoming Calamity, Catastrophe, Cataclysm, or Apocalypti facing the USA Homeland. Knowingly or not, Warner's Savants of the Future serve the dual purpose of providing us with contemporary entertainment and issuing timely alerts about events days, weeks, months, years, or even decades away. Clearly, Warner is using RAMPAGE's killer croc to represent the Red Commie KGB Chief-turned ""President"" (aka, ""the Russian Reptile""). The mangy dingo symbolizes the Kremlin's lap dog (aka, our deplorable POTUS #45, installed by the KGB through a Rigged Election). This leaves movie goers to puzzle out the figurative identity of the third giant beast, gal gobbler ""George"" the gorilla. As anyone following Current Events during the past year well knows, this can be none other than Special Counsel Bob. Though some will see ""Claire"" as Third Lady Melancholia, ""Hot"" First Daughter ""Buy Her Stuff,"" or Ms. Conwoman, it can be argued that the eaten-alive Claire constitutes a composite of this Unholy Trio. However, in the Final Analysis, one has to proclaim ""Hats off"" to Warner for its triumphal take on our Clear and Present Danger (namely, RAMPAGE).",Rampage
17,view_and_review,Video Game Fanboy Given Huge Budget,4,22 April 2018,"With the discovery of CGI movies were able to go in new directions. With it's improvement the boundaries have been removed for moviemakers. The only thing that limits them is budget. With the ability to do so much cinematically a new cinematic feat was ushered in: widespread destruction. Now, someone can destroy an entire city just for fun. Maybe it started with Independence Day, may before that, but it has reached epidemic status. San Francisco, New York and L.A. have been destroyed multiple times. The movie Pacific Rim wanted to make sure no foreign cities were left out. But there seemed to be one major U.S. city that has not been toppled and rebuilt several times over and that was Chicago. Yes, it was swarmed and mutilated in one of the Transformers movies which meant it was due for another thrashing.In steps Rampage. You knew this movie was coming. The ground was fertile for such a movie as this. Video game movies have been very successful and now we have the technology to show entire densely populated cities being leveled. Rampage is a video game about gargantuan animals destroying densely populated cities. If you like demolition for demolition sake then you'll like this movie. If you're like me and you want at least a semblance of a decent plot and credible characters then this movie is not for you. The animals themselves, their purpose and their actions were so hackneyed. They were normal animals that became humongous as well as extremely violent because of a genetics experiment. Davis Okoye (Dwayne Johnson) was an animal trainer that was friends with the albino gorilla. These nearly indestructible animals pounded the city of Chicago into submission. The military had a swift and very extreme response but of course we need drama.Rampage looked hastily put together. There was no real thought given to anything. It looked like the work of a video game fanboy that was given a huge budget.",Rampage
18,AlsExGal,In the words of John Oliver...,6,19 February 2019,"""Why did they miss the opportunity to name this movie ""Wolf Blitzer""?"". Dwayne Johnson is not just the gentle giant, he is the likeable giant who talks softly and carries a big stick AND has the brains to boot. That pleasing voice of his that is almost broadcast quality helps too. So he is all of that in this film that carries few surprises, but if you like Johnson and you are in the mood for a smash-em-up film that is pretty much paint by numbers with predictable supporting characters out of central casting, this should fit the bill.Johnson plays a primatologist who befriends a silver backed gorilla named George, and the two communicate using sign language. But one night, from a destroyed space station, three canisters loaded with a gene mutating pathogen land on earth and in - of course - the United States. If they landed in China, Russia, and Afghanistan this would be a much different movie! One canister exposes George, another a wolf, and another a crocodile in the Everglades. Cue evil corporate baddies, the military who can be both a help and a hurt in these situations, a complete misrepresentation of CRSPR technology, and, of course, the mutated wolf flies.Like I said, if you just want to put your brain on hold this is not a bad time passer and pretty much gives you what you expect in a routine action film.",Rampage
19,Wizard-8,You've seen all of it before... really.,4,26 October 2019,"Years ago, the late film critic Gene Siskel on his television show gave Hollywood some advice: ""Don't make a movie based on a video game"". But as you probably know, Hollywood didn't take that advice and made some video game based movies that weren't very good, this one included. The main problem that this movie has is that it's basically a dumb B movie with a high budget. There's nothing wrong with a B movie if it's done with attributes like skill, humor, and original touches. But as I said, this is a DUMB B movie. Despite having four screenwriters, the plot of this movie unfolds in a manner that is extremely familiar and predictable - you'll always be one (or more) steps ahead of the characters and the situations. That includes the action sequences as well as the stuff between them. While I admit that I was never truly bored by the movie despite its familiarity and predictability, at the same time I was wishing that I could have seen something a lot more original. The one bright spot in the movie is Dwayne Johnson, who like in his other movies gives off a lot of charm and likability despite being given a character that was written with no surprises or real depth at all. He deserves a lot better than this.",Rampage
20,FlashCallahan,Romp-age.......,7,27 April 2018,"Primatologist Davis Okoye shares an unshakable bond with George, an extraordinarily intelligent, silverback gorilla that's been in his care since birth. When a rogue genetic experiment goes wrong, it causes George, a wolf and a reptile to grow In size. As the mutated beasts embark on a path of destruction, Okoye teams up with a former genetic engineer and the military to secure an antidote and prevent a global catastrophe.......Rampage is nothing more than an event film starring The Rock, and wether your a fan of the actor, will give you an opinion of what to expect from this film.It's a mix of Congo and San Andreas, and if you think those two films were average at best, you know what you are getting yourself into.It's a silly film with awfully clunky dialogue, passable effects, and supporting characters that are the epitome of predictability, but one cannot help just to get sucked into it all thanks to the central performance.Johnson, as always, lifts the film into a level of enjoyment that shouldn't be had. The amount of injury his character must go through, is ridiculous, but you just go with it, because it's Johnson.The final third is the money shot, and it's stupendously enjoyable, but take heed, this isn't for children.For a movie that is loosely based on a silly video game, it's really dark. The amount of carnage on screen is ridiculous, and Peyton pulls no punches on showing on screen death, which really surprised me.Dean Morgan hams it up as the character who basically hands out bonuses and extra lives throughout, and he is clearly aware of its ridiculousness.It does take itself a little serious at times, but all in all, it's a film that needs to be seen on the biggest screen possible, so you can just take in its audacity.Brainless fun.....",Rampage
21,phd_travel,Spectacular effects - King Kong plus,7,29 September 2018,Definitely worth a watch as a monster of an action movie.The spectacular battle in Chicago is quite something if overlong and a bit repetitive. Too much indestructibility both of the animals and the Rock. The story is alright. The premise for the Monster animals is interesting. The humor is welcome among the rampage. Bottom line the effects are stunning. Worth a watch.,Rampage
22,Aaron1375,"Entertaining, but at times felt cheap",7,21 May 2018,"I went to this movie with my fiance because it was her turn to pick the movie and she actually narrowed it down to this or some Tyler Perry movie about a woman getting revenge or something. Suffice to say, I talked her into seeing this one so while it was not a super fantastic film, it was surely more entertaining to me than that other film would have been. This one had some very good moments and the monsters running amok at the end of the film was really good, that being said, there were also times when I just got a cheap vibe from the movie and considering the budget of 120 million, I should not have had one. Still, it was a fun movie for the most part and nothing to be taken to seriously and nothing that is going to be looked back on as a classic. Just a popcorn flick that one enjoys while it lasts but does not leave much of a lasting impact. The story starts out in a spaceship in space where an experiment with a rat has gone out of control. A woman tries to escape the ship with the formula that cause the rat to gain size and go out of control, but her escape pod explodes; however, the the formula survives reentry and vials of the stuff go to various places across the US. One crashes in a swamp, the other in the woods and the final in a zoo. The zoo has like an ape refuge run by Dwayne Johnson's character Davis who doesn't care for people and is good friends with a white ape within named George. Soon George begins to grow at an alarming rate and getting more aggressive. A wolf also becomes infected and begins to go crazy. The corporation responsible which is run by a brother/sister tandem tries to cover up evidence of their wrong doing by setting off a beacon that will make the animals more aggressive in the hopes that George who is captured and on a plane will down said plane because it carries a former employee who has dirt on them. This beacon also draws the crazed beasts to the heart of Chicago where the rampage shall take place and another behemoth appears in the form of a giant alligator! The movie is based on a video game of the same name; however, that being said it differs from said game a bit. In the game you picked between three different monsters and then destroyed buildings all across the country. It is fun at first, but gets quite monotonous after a while. The backstory is where the movie differs the most as the monsters in the game were humans that got turned into beasts, while this one just has animals mutating. The parts of the film that seem off, like they belong in a SyFy channel made movie are the brother and sister villains of the piece. They are both so generic and horrible actors that they do not seem like they belong in the film at all. So the film was entertaining, but so far my least favorite film I have seen at the theater in 2018. Of course, had I seen that Tyler Perry movie my fiance was talking about seeing I am sure it would be a more solid number one least favorite film. As it is, if this is the worst I see all year, then it is going to be a very good year because this one was enjoyable. Just needed a bit more to buffer it and better villains. The film though does deliver one heck of a rampage at the end!",Rampage
23,deloudelouvain,How to crash a helicopter and not lose at least a limb,5,23 June 2018,"This is another high budget action movie. One of those you get every year, one you just watch because most people will. It's not great, you know it will be all extremely exagerated, and I don't even talk about the huge size of the animals, that's actually the fun part, but the action scenes where our 'heroes' come out without a scratch while anyone of us would at least have severe trauma's. I guess crashing with a helicopter from a eighty-five story tall building is not really a thing to worry about. You know that with 'The Rock' it will be a piece of cake. Dwayne Johnson, what can I say, he will never be my favorite actor, neither will Jeffrey Dean Morgan. The story is okay if you put all the testosterone aside, but to me that's just the major problem of those kind of movies. It's just all too exagerated and that doesn't do any good to the quality of a story. The CGI's were okay but with that kind of budget that's the minimum to expect.",Rampage

While I clearly didn't have a ball, I didn't really mind the film either. Its, at best, a very watchable film, that works in parts.'Rampage' Synopsis: When three different animals become infected with a dangerous pathogen, a primatologist and a geneticist team up to stop them from destroying Chicago.'Rampage', which is loosely based on the video game series of the same name by Midway Games, has some fun to offer. Watching the animals become abnormally giant and destructive, along-with superb visual-effects & the fast-pace, never turns boring. Dwayne Johnson adds muscle to the goings-on, giving the film the heft is strongly needs. But, The Screenplay settles for laziness. Despite some crazy loud action, the Writing is overall, soulless. You don't really feel for any of its characters, be it the humans or the animals. You watch them in chaos, but never end up rooting for any. Also, the supporting characters (particularly Naomie Harris & Jeffrey Dean Morgan), aren't given with much to do, and hence, don't add much to the narrative. A Stronger & more Consistent Screenplay was needed, for sure. Brad Peyton's Direction is passable. Cinematography, Editing & Background Score, are decent.On the whole, 'Rampage' is fun in parts. And Dwayne Johnson delivers once again. Go in with limited expectations & chances of being letdown will be minimal.",Rampage
26,Hellmant,All of the human stuff is mostly boring.,7,13 April 2018,"'RAMPAGE': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)A sci-fi monster flick based on the popular video game, of the same name (by Midway Games), about a genetic experiment gone wrong that transforms a trio of animals into destructive monsters. Dwayne Johnson stars as a primatologist who tries to rescue an infected albino gorilla, which he had bonded with, and stop the other monsters from destroying the city. The film costars Naomie Harris, Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Malin Åkerman, Jake Lacy, P.J. Byrne and Joe Manganiello . It was directed by Brad Peyton (who previously teamed with Johnson on the 2015 disaster flick 'SAN ANDREAS'), and it was scripted by Ryan Engle, Carlton Cuse, Ryan J. Condal and Adam Sztykiel. The film has received mixed to negative reviews from critics, and it's expected to be a modest hit at the Box Office as well. I found it to be mildly amusing (at times) but mostly forgettable. Davis Okoye (Johnson) is an animal loving primatologist in Rwanda, who's also the head of an anti-poaching team there. His best friend is an albino silverback gorilla named George (Jason Liles). When Davis learns that George has been infected by an unknown substance, and is growing at an alarming rate because of it, he teams with a genetic engineer, named Dr. Kate Caldwell (Harris), to try and help him. Then he learns that two other animals have been infected by the same experimental serum, and the trio are soon destroying the city. Davis does everything he can to save his friend, and stop the rampaging monsters.My favorite parts of the movie are the animals, the animal/human relationships, and the monster fight scenes. I also found the battle scenes in the climax to be pretty amusing, and nostalgic, when they imitate the video game it's based on (which I played back in the day). All of the human stuff is mostly boring though. The Rock has a few good scenes in it, and Akerman makes a sexy femme fatale villain (Lacy is mildly amusing as her dimwitted brother too), but other than that the movie is pretty dull when it centers on the humans (and all the unnecessary plot nonsense). So some of the film is entertaining, and worth seeing, but most of it is annoying filler.",Rampage
27,thesar-2,Mighty Jorge Young,8,5 August 2018,"Between a Rock and a hard sell, they did it right.Growing up, I had many favorite video games. Tron, Street Fighter II, Joust, Ms. Pac-Man, Elevator Action, Shinobi, Super Mario Bros 1-World, Bionic Commando, Dig Dug, Dallas Quest, Final Fantasy and F-Zero just to name a few. Rampage was definitely on my favorites list as well.But, it's been many years since I've played it, so I just now went to the YouTubes to refresh my adulthood mind. Ahh, yes, I loved this game. And revisiting the game after seeing the movie, I concur: they really did a bang-up job of recreating the simple concept into a feature length fun, popcorn movie.In a nice cold (in space, get it?) opening, growth and enhancement experiment containers rocket towards Earth and gives a crocodile, wolf and our hero, sign-language loving and friend to The Rock, George, a new outrageous size and lust for having a meet and destroy in Chicago.It was actually clever on how the three new, spread out threats are drawn to the city, or the game's setting in Illinois. It was also nice one of the villains was played by one of my favorite, hardly ever mentioned actresses: Malin Akerman. Every time I see her on screen, I want to immediately pull out one of my favorite Horror/Comedy/Homage BluRays: The Final Girls.But, in addition to her always being a wonderful spotlight, you'll get Negan being Negan and True Blood's Werewolf vs. another onscreen wolf. And I thought having the Rock and the cute nerd, P.J. Byrne was good enough.The graphics were great and the story never took itself too seriously which led me to have a fantastic time watching this. My only regret is that I didn't see it in theatres. THIS is just the type of summer (yeah, I know, April, but Hollywood's been pushing back Summer to March for years now) fun, no-brainer fare. Enjoy it!***Final thoughts: Funny on how these silent and sign language movies coincidentally keep landing in my recent new-to-me movie lineups. First, my first time seeing 1927's Metropolis where I had to figure out, for the most part, what they were saying since most of the title cards were missing. Next was 2018's A Quiet Place where I might have been lost without knowing what they were signing. And now, this. Next, I should finally see 2017's War for the Planet of the Apes that I missed last year.",Rampage

While it is clear that the studio just wanted a big 'bash-crash-smash' movie and a name that people would recognise to double down on its franchise potential and immediate payoff value, the piece isn't all that bad and is actually quite an entertaining, if silly, ride throughout. It shamelessly apes a few films, of a generally better quality, along the way but always knows what it is, without being too self deprecating, and without talking down to its audience. This makes for a fun time that only really falls short when 'The Rock' rocks up with a grenade launcher and starts going toe-to-toe with the CGI creatures that had previously looked quite convincing but, in the finale, just look quite silly. It's ultimately a decent romp that's never quite as bad as you'd expect, but not quite as good as you'd hope either. 6/10",Rampage
30,bowmanblue,A Sega Master system game never looked so good,8,16 April 2018,"I know that movies based on computer games have a bad reputation (and deservedly so!), so I'm guessing that not many of today's youth have ever participated in the joys of controlling George (a giant monkey), Lizzie (and giant lizard) and Ralph (my personal favourite character in the game - a giant wolf) as the trio inflict major damage on every American city back in the arcades in the eighties (and on the Master System in my bedroom during my teenage years!).Maybe movies based on computer games don't do well because they try too hard to concentrate on the story which they never seem to be able to, while appealing to the game's 'core audience' who undoubtedly all have their own ideas regarding what a big-screen adaptation should be like. As I mentioned, 'Rampage' (the game) had a simple premise - choose one of three giant monsters and unleash hell on the human population of major cities. It was dumb, entertaining fun. And, perhaps most importantly, it doesn't have a story - allowing the film-makers the creative freedom to adapt the best bits and add whatever they like without fear of annoying old gamers, such as myself.Did I mention the game was dumb entertaining fun? Well... that basically sums up the movie, too. Dwayne Johnson stars as, er, the same Dwayne Johnson we've seen in almost all his action movies, as he cares for a giant ape in an animal preserve. Three mutating canisters falling from space later and he finds that his pet ape, George, is now not just a giant ape, but a GIANT ape! And then all hell breaks loose.That's about it in terms of plot. You're not watching this for its deep emotional states, character arcs and hidden social and political meaning. You just want to see big monsters slug it out (and Dwayne Johnson, no doubt). And, if that's all you're looking for, you'll leave the cinema totally satisfied. 'Rampage' doesn't try to be clever - it just has fun being what it is - a cheesy, popcorn movie that you can just enjoy.There are a couple of minor gripes I could mention. For people like me who knew the game well, I could lament on how certain elements of the creatures are 'technically incorrect,' but that would just be me nit-picking. About my only major problem was with a scene where a character is - in my opinion - critically-wounded and yet gets up seconds later and carries on as if nothing has happened! It just made me think of that Arnie gag in 'The Last Action Hero' where a gunshot is merely a 'flesh wound' in a film.So, if that's what you like then you won't be disappointed. Plus it even has 'Neegan' from 'The Walking Dead' (okay, so not technically Neegan, but Jeffrey Dean Morgan doesn't stray much from the man responsible for making a zombie apocalypse even more unbearable for Rick and his cronies.",Rampage
31,ThomasDrufke,Ridiculous and Somewhat Fun,6,17 April 2018,"I will see The Rock in any movie, whether that be the rated R failure that was Baywatch or the entertaining family flick, Jumanji. At this point, he's more than the ""franchise viagra"" he was once deemed, he's probably the biggest movie star in the world, in terms of consistently opening films to a big number. Rampage will likely go down as one of his more forgettable films, but even in saying that, it's hard not to appreciate some of the more ridiculously entertaining moments of this action adventure. Centering around The Rock's Davis Okoye and his pet/job/friend George the Ape, Rampage follows a few species who have been physically enhanced because of a faulty genetic testing experiment gone wrong. The story? Well there isn't really one. It's essentially just the world's biggest actor trying to save the worlds biggest ape (aside from Kong) from destroying half of Chicago while also being attacked by a huge lizard/crocodile/alligator/whatever the heck that was. It's the prototypical turn your brain off silly action adventure film, but it's not quite fun enough (or dumb enough) be get my vote. There's nothing great and nothing horrible (besides some awful subplot scenes involving Jake Lacy and Malin Akerman. Phew, glad that's over. In all, Rampage is enough stupid fun with a Negan-esque performance from Jeffrey Dean Morgan, some great monster action, and another shining performance from The Rock.

I didn't even know ""Rampage"" was based on a video game of the same name. I just thought it was giant gorilla because generic King Kong, crocodile because kind of Godzilla, and a wolf because... I don't know, werewolves or direwolves or something. Insert Hollywood's most likable muscle man, Dwayne Johnson, as--hold back your laughter--a primatologist, to go around doing muscle-man stuff with a smile and an occasional joke during all the CGI mutated animal carnage--not too bloody, though, and don't finish that word after ""mother"" because we got to keep that PG-13 rating. I kind of want to take back some of the negative things I've said about the Monsterverse now, this piggybacking cash grab is so bad.Generic genetic engineering science-gone-wrong sci-fi with spaceship explosions. A plane crash that makes me yearn for the superior one in ""The Mummy"" (2017), of all also-awful movies. Generic evil corporation with hissing and sniveling villains that aren't even amusingly so. Inept and ineffectual military. Jeffrey Dean Morgan seemed to have stumbled off the set of ""The Walking Dead"" without breaking character. The opening explanatory text is entirely unnecessary. Naomie Harris offers Johnson a fist bump instead of a handshake even though the picture hadn't shown her seeing that this was how he finalized agreements with the gorilla--that's just lazy screenwriting as composed by a team of screenwriters. The throughline of Johnson's character's development is about him liking animals more than people, which is hackneyed and dull. It takes a very low opinion of one's audience to engineer blandness this bad. Oh, it made $428 million at the box office.

Then again, I heard that after the original Mario movie, Nintendo banned films based on their franchises except for ""Pokémon"".It's great we have such a good actor like Dwayne Johnson (he's really not called The Rock anymore). The main highlight of this film are of course the amazing visuals. This is some really great looking CGI.

35,CuriosityKilledShawn,Dumb as a sack of rocks,3,15 October 2019,"I remember playing Rampage on the Commodore 64 when I was a kid (I never got to play the arcade version) and I enjoyed it for the macabre mash-up of King Kong, Godzilla, and Werewolf chaotic action. It was so satisfying to pound on tall buildings and watch them crumble while munching on the puny humans that tried to stop you.Over 30 years later, and with so many, many video games offering an embarrassment of riches when it comes to movie-making possibilities, what kind of nitwit would consider Rampage, of all things, to be the best material worthy of a screenplay and feature-length running time? There is so little work with here it literally makes the Double Dragon movie look like a classic.Dwayne Johnson is Davis Okoye, a primatologist who is best friends with George, an albino ape who's family was murdered. This is the part of what appealed to me about Rampage. I like things with big apes and I especially like movies where humans make best friends with animals. If more time had been spent establishing George and Davis as pals it might have been better, but the title promises a Rampage so we need to get to that, eventually.After an actually exciting opening scene where a space station lab disintegrates and scatters a infectious pathogen across North America, a wolf, an alligator (it seems) and George himself are caught in the chaos when it crash-lands. All of them begin to grow to out-of-control proportions and become highly sought-after by Energyne, the shady company that owned the space station. Brother/sister company directors Claire and Brett Wyden switch on a special beacon on the roof of their Willis Tower headquarters to lure in the animals but Davis, and his FBI side-show (a wasted Jeffrey Dean Morgan) get in on the action and try to save George.Wow, what a load of convoluted garbage! I can't believe I just wasted a chunky paragraph attempting to relay the hodge-podge of trash that is this movie's plot. There's nothing remotely original or unique about Rampage as it's blatantly derivative of many other movies such as Congo, Godzilla, King Kong, 2012, and Pacific Rim, particularly in the city destruction scenes, which I have referred to as ""9/11 porn"" for a few years now. So many, many, many movies now feature these tiresome, redundant climaxes of CGI chaos and non-existent cartoon adversaries clobbering each other until one of them falls over for good. It's a ludicrous irony that the fun of watching a building crumble on my Commodore 64 was more enjoyable than the mind-numbing fury that was this movie's big ending.Spoiler alert: the Willis Tower, once the tallest building on the planet, topples over during the climax, and not once is there any sense of scale, awe, excitement, vertigo, or panic. It's just an empty CGI spectacle that we have all become desensitised to and has all the breathtaking punch of TV static. No one cares about this anymore. We can't believe in any of this nonsense if it is never presented as anything resembling reality. For all of his interactions with George, you know it's just Dwayne Johnson talking to a green screen with his eye-line slightly off-point. Only in one shot in the entire movie is his interaction with George a practical effect. The aforementioned Congo has endured a lot of hate since it's release in 1995, but at least those apes were tangible animatronic effects or men in suits and the effect was a lot better than this.There's virtually nothing to recommend about Rampage. Fans of Joe Manganiello will be baffled as to why his character is introduced as a hardcore antagonist only to be killed mere minutes later. It adds absolutely nothing to the movie but to further convolute a muddled, derivative plot that is nothing but a blatant mish-mash of scenes stolen from other, better movies.Utterly uninspired, ugly and ultimately pointless.

But it had no story, it was devoid of plot! So how could you possibly make a movie based on it over 30yrs later?Well they did and the story is thinner than Kate Moss's waistline. It tells the story of everyones favourite wrestler turner actor the Rock chasing after the genetically modified gorilla he saved years before. Cue cgi, chaos, monsters, falling buildings, explosions and all the usual tropes.With all three original monster George, Ralph and Lizzie (Though nobody acknowledges Lizzie's name) it's about as loyal as it can physically be considering the lack of material to actually work with.I still can't get my head around why they would make it?

40,The-Sarkologist,Some Building Smashing Fun,4,14 April 2018,"Back in the 80s a game hit the video arcades where you played a monster and the object was to climb up buildings and basically knock them down while being shot at by little tanks on the ground. If you really wanted to you could climb back down and bash up those tanks as well, which was important because if you didn't these tanks would eventually kill you. Anyway, it was quite fun, and of course it ended up being ported to the Commodore 64, which meant that I got to play it a lot more. This game was called Rampage, and it is actually what this film is based on (and yes, one of the monsters was a giant ape).
 As seems to be all the rage these days, a corporation is performing genetic experiments, and because it is illegal, the experiments are being conducted in space. Unfortunately it goes wrong, the space station explodes, but the canisters fall to Earth, and three animals get infected - a crocodile, a wolf, and an ape that happens to be the best friend of our protagonist, Dawyne 'The Rock' Johnson. Since the game involved monsters smashing up a city, these monsters make a beeline for Chicago to have a lot of building smashing fun.
 Well, the movie was fun, and it is what you can expect from your typical monster movie - big monsters smashing up buildings and the US army incapable of stopping them. Then again, we do have The Rock who comes in and saves the day, and also manages to cure the big ape so that he has a monster ally when he is fighting the other big monsters. Honestly, what more can you expect from such a film. Well, it is based on a video game, though I am still baffled why they decided to pick a game that hasn't been around for thirty odd years to turn into a film - probably because nobody would have realised it, though I would hardly call this film original.
 One thing that I didn't like was that the antagonists pretty much seemed to get away with their shenanigans. Well, they were killed, but in my mind being eaten by a giant wolf, and having a huge block fall on you, just doesn't seem to be all that satisfying. I actually prefer that they be hauled off by the authorities, and their company bankrupted because they have to pay for the clean up costs of all the damage they caused (and when you have a bunch of monsters tearing up a city, the costs are going to be astronomical). Still, it was fun, and there were a few cool lines in it as well. Oh, and the final scene was really sweet.",Rampage

The acting is gosh awful. Especially with the 2 head scientist they were corny and cringy. Dwyane's performance was wooden as was everyone else's.The CGI was awful. The story failed because of bad acting, cgi, dialogue and the movie was about Dwyane more than about the rampaging. This movie has very little rampaging. Its basically a cilckbait movie to endorse Dwayne Johnson.",Rampage

45,cruise01,"Action packed, big, loud, and a lot of fun.",9,14 April 2018,"Rampage (4.5 out of 5 stars).Video game adaptations into films have been ongoing with a curse from missing a specific target audience. Resident Evil's are not great films but have been entertaining with its action. The new Tomb Raider reboot was surprisingly good but could have been more. And there are other lacklusters like Prince of Persia, Doom, Silent Hill, ect. A movie about three giant monsters of a crocodile, gorilla, and a grey wolf causing a mass destruction in a city. Yes, that is what the arcade games are about and that is exactly what you can expect in this Rampage film. At least, it is one hell of a wild ride of fun. So don't expect any award winning script with great dialogue, a long developing story, or logic with characters choices in the movie. If you leave all the critical thinking out before watching the film, you will find the film to be what it is. And it does its job, which is entertaining and being a lot of fun. The plot follows after a science experiment gone wrong in space leaving three canisters to fall on Earth. A primatologist Davis (Dwayne Johnson) notices one of his gorilla friend George is infected with and a lot bigger. After his agitation and escape from the Zoo. The government agent Harvey (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) captures George and tries to take him into a more secured location. Meanwhile, a corporation that was in charge of the space station experiment of genetic editing led by Claire (Malin Akerman) and her brother Brett (Jake Lacy) tries to send a signal to bring in the giant gorilla and the other two infected beasts of a giant grey wolf and a mutated crocodile. The film is a lot of fun. It has a lot of action and big set pieces. It is loud, big, and dumb. But it is definitely a film of escapism of watching three giant beasts destroying a city. While the military are giving everything they got to stop them. And Davis and Dr. Kate (Naomie Harris) are trying to find a solution to get George back and to have the giant gorilla stop the other two beasts. The visual effects are awesome. There may be some cheesy cgi with the military jets or watching Dwayne Johnson running through falling buildings and avoiding a lot of heavy debris while the monsters are battling it out. Dwayne Johnson is becoming one of the actors you enjoy watching on screen. If you either like his big tough attitude responses or enjoy him facing the impossible with the action sequences. Naomie Harris was okay playing a sidekick character with Davis. Malin Akerman and Jake Lacy play cheesy villains of a cliché corporation on wanting to create deadly experiments for there own personal gain. Jeffrey Dean Morgan was a lot of fun playing a cowboy attitude government agent. (Almost feels like he was playing the same character as Negan from The Walking Dead series). Director Brad Peyton created a wild ride with San Andreas film. He does the same with Rampage. It is big and loud and action packed. From an exciting sequence with mercenaries fighting with a giant wolf in the forest to George's escape on the plane. And the final half hour climax of three monsters causing mass destruction. Also, there is some fun humor. And George and Davis friendship does try to build an emotional connection with the gorilla that tries to have you rooting for the beast. Overall, Rampage is a really good film. It is action packed throughout. The visual effects are awesome. The characters are fun and cheesy. The plot and concept is everything you can expect for a blockbuster fun of monsters causing destructions. I recommend seeing this film on the big screen in theatres. If you are looking for a blockbuster escapism of big action and mass destruction. And seeing Dwayne Johnson battle through this destruction. This would be the film to check out. It is a lot of fun.",Rampage
46,Floated2,High octane entertainment,7,10 April 2019,"Rampage is based on old arcade video game and it's fun for what it's worth. People complain at how silly the plot is, and even so the film remains highly enjoyable and has enough thrills and fun entertainment.In general, the film is slightly better than expected but not completely surprised, as it was by the same director which done San Andreas (another highly fun lead starring film by the Rock).There's not much to think about with Rampage, which is what makes it ""brainless"" entertaining. Highlighted by an entertaining scene involving the animals (gorilla, wolf, crocodile) growing in large size as we see them destroying the city of New York, their buildings, cars, etc. Another positive is the chemistry and relationship we see with the Rock and George (the gorilla) throughout the film.Overall, even with this film being cliched or predictable, it does what it sets out to be.

47,eddie_baggins,To serious for its own good,5,12 April 2018,"When a film is based on an old 80's arcade game, stars The Rock and centres around three oversized mutated animals creating raucous across the USA, you know what you're getting yourself in for and in that respect Rampage offers an experience that is exactly as advertised, with one caveat, someone forgot to tell San Andreas director Bray Peyton that this type of film should never be conducted under any illusion of seriousness.At its best when it plays to the lighter touch and cracks wise at the ridiculous nature of the situations that inhabit its screen time, Rampage can at times be a popcorn munching good time but far too often Peyton takes time out from the fun as the film finds itself trying to ratchet up the drama or create backstory for characters we care little about, while the films biggest stars (George the oversized Gorilla and his friends Mr. Wolf and Mr. Crocodile) go about largely in the background until Peyton goes for broke with some fairly impressive carnage in the films last act set in Chicago.It's a shame Rampage doesn't focus more on what makes it tick as a piece of throwaway entertainment as when you throw in some terribly conveyed corporate baddies in the form of Malin Akerman's Claire Wyden and Jake Lacey to go along with the so-so dialogue and long winded set-up, Rampage can often feel like a chore to sit through, so much so that not even the usually undeniable charms of Dwayne Johnson can overcome.In that phase of his career where he must tread carefully so not to become a self-parody of similar role after similar role, Johnson pretty much plays himself here as kindly ex-soldier turned animal saviour Davis Okoye whose friendship with George may just hold the key to saving mankind from these genetically altered beasts and it's a bit of a tired performance, especially with Johnson given far too many ""po-faced"" moments instead of more wise quips like ""that's a big arm, don't fight it"".Other members of the human team fair about the same with the capable Naomie Harris playing the typical female support with only Negan Dean Morgan getting the memo about what the film should be like, with his government agent Harvey Russell a breath of fresh air for the film as Morgan swaggers around the sets with his cowboy drawl and attitude, displaying a sense of fun and incredible timing (seriously, he just continually shows up at the right place and right time) that when combined with the impressive CGI monster creations, make Rampage a film with genuine moments of enjoyment.Final Say - Too often found trying to ground itself in a more serious tone than was needed, Rampage loses focus of what would've made it a truly fun blockbuster event and while it does have some fun moments and a scene where The Rock takes to a boat sized crocodile with a grenade launcher, Rampage is another disappointing video game adaptation that's elevated by some impressive production values and some memorable monsters.2 1/2 Ford Broncos out of 5",Rampage
48,leonblackwood,"Same 'ol, same 'ol from the Rock! 4/10",4,24 August 2018,"Review:
Guess what people, the Rock is playing the innocent hero, who saves the world again! Isn't that a shock! The only difference in this film is that the visual effects were spot on but apart from that, it's just another Dwayne Johnson film, where he is saving the world whilst battling against evil. Right from the beginning of the film, you know that he's going to save the day, even though he has to fight against a huge wolf, a horrible sea monster and an angry ape. The movie is based on the old arcade game called Rampage, which was popular in the 80's. Personally, I couldn't see any similarities, even though the director says that he was trying to stay true to the game but I didn't know that they were connected until I watched the bonus material. Anyway, the movie kicks off in space, were Athena-1, a space station owned by Energyne, is destroyed after a laboratory rat mutates and wreaks havoc. Dr. Kerry Atkins (Marley Shelton), who is the lone surviving crew member, is ordered by the CEO of Energyne, Claire Wyden (Malin Akerman) to retrieve research canisters containing a pathogen. Kerry manages to escape from the rat and sets her course for earth in an escape pod. During her escape, the station explodes but due to the damage from the rat, the escape pod disintegrates upon re-entry, which ends up killing her. The falling pieces leave a trail of debris across the United States, including the Everglades in Florida, where a canister is consumed by an American crocodile, and a forest in Wyoming, where a grey wolf is exposed to the pathogen. Meanwhile, Davis Okoye (Dwayne Johnson), is a former US Army Special Forces soldier, and a member of an anti-poaching unit, who works at the San Diego Wildlife Sanctuary. He befriends a rare albino gorilla named George, whom he saved from poachers, and they communicate via sign language and hand gestures. During the night, one of the canisters land in George's habitat, which exposes him to the pathogen. Over time, George grows larger and becomes more aggressive, so Davis is contacted by a genetic engineer, Dr. Kate Caldwell (Naomie Harris), who explains that the pathogen was developed by Energyne, to rewrite genes on a massive scale. She also tells Davis that Energyne planned to use the pathogen as a biological weapon, and that she had hoped to advance the research to potentially cure disease, and that the company fired her and got her put in prison for attempting to expose them. Anyway, George escapes from captivity and goes on a rampage at the preserve. Davis calms him down but he is captured by a government team, led by Agent Harvey Russell (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), and there put on an aeroplane. Meanwhile, Claire sends a squad of mercenaries to capture the mutated wolf but they are all brutally killed. Claire then uses a huge transmitter atop the Willis Tower to lure all three of the animals, who have been engineered to respond aggressively to a radio frequency in Chicago. George responds to the frequency and causes the plane to crash but Davis, Kate and Russell manage to parachute to safety. George also survives the crash and joins the other animals while they are making there way to Chicago. After being saved by the army, Davis and Kate are locked up, while Russell is trying to convince the commander that they have information to stop the uncontrollable animals. Davis and Kate then manage to steal a helicopter, with the help of Russell, and they make there way to Chicago. When they finally reach Chicago, they can see the animals tearing through the city, with the military struggling to contain them. When the crocodile joins the other animals Davis and Kate make a plan to steal a counter-serum, hoping that they can turn the mutated animals back to normal. When they finally get to the serum, Claire and her brother, Brett (Jake Lacy) catch them in the act. Claire reveals that the serum only eliminates the animal's aggressiveness, rather than revert them to their normal sizes. Claire then shoots Davis and takes Kate hostage at gunpoint but Davis is still alive, and of course, he saves the day. After putting one of the vials in Claire's bag, Kate pushes Claire towards George, who eats her, along with the serum. While the building is falling apart, Davis and Kate survive by hovering in a damaged helicopter amidst the shower of debris. With George back to normal, he defeats the other two animals, with the help of Davis, and Kate stops the army from dropping a lethal bomb, which will destroy most of the city. So basically, the Rock saves the day, once again. Visually, I was impressed with the final product but the storyline was extremely far-fetched and full of potholes. I didn't get why the army kept on shooting at the animals, when they weren't damaging them at all, and why the commander didn't listen to Davis and Kate when they said they had a way to destroy them. Anyway, after destroying most of a city, and the military, it amazes me how the Rock can stand toe to toe with the animals, and damage them. With that aside, I did like George, and his warped sense of humour and Harvey Russell but the Rock and Naomie got on my nerves after a while. It's still worth a watch, mainly because of the action and the animals but apart from that, it's just your usual Rock movie, with all the bells and whistles. Not Bad!Round-Up:
This movie was directed by Brad Peyton, who also brought you Cats & Dogs: The Revenge of Kitty Galore, Journey 2: The Mysterious Island and San Andreas, which also starred the Rock. There are many similarities between this movie and San Andreas, where the Rock saves the day again, so I'm not surprised to see that Brad directed that movie as well. Personally, I think that the Rock has to be careful with his career, even though his movies have grossed over $3Billion because he is starting to become typecasted in all of his movies. Although he played a baddie in Pain & Gain, he was still the innocent one, who just didn't have the common sense to stop what he was doing. That's the only movie that I have found where he hasn't played the hero, which says a lot because he has starred in over 35 movies. He's due to star in Big Trouble In Little China, Black Adam, Doc Savage, Suicide Squad 2, San Andreas 2, Jumanji 2 and Red Notice, which is in production now, and is about an Interpol agent who tracks the world's most wanted art thief. No doubt he'll be the hero in that as well! He has come far since his wrestling days, and the poor acting at the beginning of his career but he has to play the baddie at some point.

49,TheMovieDiorama,Rampage ferociously ravages the senses and brings our worst fears of biological weaponry to life.,7,20 April 2018,"Sounds dark and savage, right? Surprisingly, one of the unexpected elements to this blockbuster is just how gritty and ruinous the narrative's tone is. And you know what? I flipping loved it! Damn, was not expecting to enjoy this and yet there I was walking out with a reinvigorated attitude. Hell yeah! A primatologist teams up with an enraged-infected albino gorilla, whose size has considerably increased, to prevent two other colossal creatures from destroying Chicago. Genetic editing, weaponised pathogens, artificial aggression...it's absurdly ludicrous. I mean just plain stupid. Fortunately, the film knows this and it wants you to know that it knows this. So, it turns up the game adaptation's fun to ""button mashing"" mode and ensures you enjoy the combinations. What really surprised me was the perfect balance of comedy and darkness. The opening sequence resembled a harrowing horror film, and the usage of gore throughout was ever present. The tone was consistently forboding. Inject this with a light hearted screenplay and a rounded piece of entertainment is crafted. Yes, the plot is unoriginal and I'm sure many will think ""isn't this Transformers?"" and yes, the primary antagonist reveals the plot as she acts out her evil scheme. The little human character development is forced, although needed where Harris and Johnson emit excellent chemistry. It's all very heavy handed, yet it's just so undeniably entertaining! I was reclining back into my seat as this giant skyscraper slowly crumbles and decimates the urban community below. The visually stunning designed creatures as they rip through military vehicles like a kid playing on an Atari 2600 (not a pretty sight...). Dwayne Johnson being Dwayne Johnson. Pure destructive awesomeness that has both heart and emotive presence. Especially the third act which was ridiculously engaging. Oh, and Peyton even threw in some long takes during the action sequences! Bonus points. Suffice to say, I needed a blockbuster like this. One of the surprises of the year for me.",Rampage

53,southdavid,Average Joe Young,6,16 April 2018,"Given that the game has no human protagonist, and no back story to adhere too, the producers of ""Rampage"" were given a blank canvass to create their story. Sadly, what they arrived at is a predictable, cliché ridden story - saved by a third act that delivers on the premise and elevates the movie back to acceptable levels. Dwayne Johnson plays Davis Okoye a former Special Forces agent turned gorilla expert working at San Diego zoo. When an (ridiculous) companies experiment goes wrong, Okoye's closest gorilla is exposed to a toxin that dramatically increases his size and aggression. Two other wild creatures, a wolf and an alligator are also exposed and soon the three creatures head towards Chicago, leaving devastation in their wake. As I said, it's all a bit stupid and predictable. Dwayne Johnson plays essentially the character he always plays. Jeffrey Dean Morgan plays Negan. Malin Akerman and Jake Lacy play siblings Claire and Brett Wyden, operators of Evil Science Incorporated, whose business degrees must have come from the same place as South Park's Underpants gnomes. The CGI for the creatures is excellent but less so for the humans and there's one scene involving a parachute jump where whichever effects house was working on it must have decided to take ""The Mummy 2""'s worst rendering of The Rock's face award. But, it does pick up and the end, once all the characters have made it to Chicago and all hell breaks loose.

You got the 3 animal characters: George the Gorilla, Ralph the Wolf, and Lizzie the Lizard. In the new 2018 action film, George is an albino gorilla. Ralph is a flying wolf, and Lizzie is a mutated alligator. Dwayne Johnson plays Davis, a primatologist who takes care of George. He communicates with George through sign-language. 
When a genetic chemical made in a space lab crash lands, George, Ralph,and Lizzie come in contact with it, and the people responsible are located in Chicago, Illinois. George is from San Diego, Ralph, the Midwest, and Lizzie is from Florida from the Gulf Coast area. 
I know that they got George right, except for the albinoism. And how did Ralph and Lizzie ended up being mutants? Ralph's flying? And Lizzie is a freak of nature. That's a little too much there. 
This movie has a bit of humor. George being very suggestive with his sign language. The action was non-stop. I enjoyed it very well. The plot was different from the game. But parts of the scenes were very close to the game. It's a keeper for me.

I mean, there's nothing that put a smile on my face more than watching Dwayne Johnson, and a Giant albino CGI ape, go up against a 30 foot wolf and a Godzilla wannabe.

This movie is based on a video game and stars Dwayne as a primatologist-a fancy name for an ape specialist-working in an animal park/zoo. Dwayne basically raises an albino gorilla-he named George-after saving him from poachers and they even talk to each other, using sign language. Malin runs a genetics company that has been doing gene splicing experimentation on rats in outer space-they figured it would be safe, away from prying government eyes that just might want to stop them. Of course, things go wrong and 3 samples of the deadly mutating pathogen comes crashing down to the earth, infecting 3 different animals, in 3 different locations. One being George and the other 2 being a wolf and a crocodile. The pathogen increases the animals' size, strength, speed and stamina to Godzilla sized proportions and they start tearing up the country. Jeffrey is a government agent that calls himself a troubleshooter for the feds and Naomie is a former employee of Malin's that thinks she knows how to stop the creatures with an antidote she had been working on. It's a pretty good old action Monster Fest. Lots of action and lots of giant monsters tearing up stuff.
It's rated ""PG-13"" for violence, action and destruction, language and some crude gestures and has a running time of 1 hour & 47 minutes.

It's fair to say the second most-memorable performance is delivered by an unconvincing computer-generated albino gorilla with a complete mastery of nuanced human communication (he and Dwayne supposedly correspond via sign language, but half the time they don't even bother pointing those gestures at each other) so one can safely assume that the phone will remain silent on the eve of this year's Academy Award nominations.If the filmmakers had spent half as much time on the plot as they did in force-feeding the original 1986 arcade cabinet into various backgrounds... well, it still probably wouldn't have been all that good.

62,alindsay-al,An above average fun monster movie,6,2 May 2018,"This film had a large marketing campaign so I have now finally seen Rampage and even though there is a lot of silly things in this film I had a fun time watching this film. The premise of this film sees a group of humans attempt to stop 3 mutated animals from destroying Chicago. Dwayne Johnson plays the lead in this film and he is very well suited for a film like this one, he is very charismatic in this film and charming as he always can be. His character also has a decent arc throughout the film that sees a well done relationship build between him and the ape George. When it comes to that ape George I haven't cared about a CGI ape as much since Caeser in the Planet of the Apes trilogy and that is down to him and Johnson's relationship. Naomie Harris plays a researcher who teams up with Johnson and she does a good job too, her character has an interesting backstory and I felt like she worked well with Johnson. Jefferey Dean Morgan plays a Government agent in this film and I really enjoyed his performance as he basically plays Negan from the Walking Dead in this film. Though I love his performance on that show so it really worked in this film. However, the two main villains are ridiculously over the top and cliché, plus Joe Manganello is really wasted in his very small role in this film. The story in this film has a very good emotional arc between the characters of Johnson and George which worked for me. Though everything else is just bare basic and it doesn't provide much to differ from other films of this type. The script has some fun dialogue that will make you chuckle and some of the drama does work, though there is quite a few opportunities where the dialogue does miss and come across as just incredibly cheesy. The style of the film is also very hit and miss, there is some huge exciting action scenes involving these creatures that got me invested. Though there was some clearly unfinished CGI sequences in this film that take away from the really well done sequences and feels like it is filmed by different people. Overall this film is a fun experience, however, you don't need to run out and watch this film in the cinemas.",Rampage

Anyone who is familiar with his work will not be blown away by what they see here, but Johnson is a good screen presence and is generally good value in these type of films. That being said the story is pretty basic and predictable, but it does at least have a sense of urgency about it which means that it moves almost as fast as the creatures. It also helps that Okoye's bond with George is shown at the beginning as this acts as the heart of the film when George is infected with the pathogen and managed to provide me with some emotional investment (which is something that tends to be missing from a lot of action films).Some of the supporting characters do let the film down slightly though; the villains of the piece brother and sister Brett and Claire Wyden are not particularly interesting villains lacking in both menace and development. It doesn't help that both Lacy and Akerman put in less than impressive and convincing turns in their respective roles.Despite this though Rampage does provide a lot of the staple requirements that one comes to expect from an action film; it's big, it's loud, it has some heart and there's plenty of destruction making it a fairly satisfying viewing experience.",Rampage
68,kirbylee70-599-526179,THE ROCK AND A HARD PLACE,8,20 August 2018,"Who would have thought several years back that one of the top box office draws when it comes to action flicks would be a WWE wrestler? I mean we had one ex-wrestler become a box office draw in Hulk Hogan but that was short lived. So maybe the reason this time around is different is a combination of charisma, self-deprecating humor, a great attitude and an ability to actually act. Yes, I'm talking about Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson. He's since dropped the Rock tag an appropriately so. He's proven himself beyond that and soared to far greater heights than those days in the ring. He's an honest to goodness movie star now and should be graded on that alone.Which brings me to this week's latest Johnson movie to make its way to DVD, RAMPAGE. Based on the arcade game that those of us who grew up when people actually visited arcades rather than play games at home, the game then involved giant animals breaking buildings and eating people. This movie has that but at least it forms a story first. Johnson plays Davis Okoye, a primatologist working at the San Diego Zoo. Not only has Davis worked with the large apes he's made friends with the zoo's star attraction, an albino gorilla named George. Using sign language the two communicate easily. And George often displays his wicked sense of humor at the expense of Davis. The film opens though with a space station carrying specimens that plummet to Earth after the station explodes. Those specimens later land in various locations, one in the mountains, one in the Everglades and the final one in the pen George and the gorillas are kept in. The mountain landing infects a wolf, the Everglades an alligator and tine final one George. Each of the animals begin to change after their exposure. The specimens were being tested in outer space to avoid legal actions by Energyne, a genetics corporation more concerned with their bottom line than the safety of those who were on the space station or pretty much anyone else on Earth. When the animals begin showing up, their desire is to capture them using a radio signal that will draw them to their location in Chicago.Unfortunately the genetic mutations the animals are going through also leaves them more agitated than normal and George soon breaks out of his cage and runs amok through the zoo before being taken down by a team that arrives with tranquilizers. This is a secret government organization run by agent Russell (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) who takes not just George but Davis and Dr. Kate Caldwell (Naomie Harris), an ex-employee of Energyne and geneticists who wants to help with the animals. Of course as things pan out in the movies George escapes making his way to Chicago and the other two animals head that direction as well. The end result of their call there is the classic game coming true as they begin destroying buildings left and right, terrorizing anyone in their path and facing off against the US military. Only Davis and Kate have a solution but will they be able to carry it out in time?The movie relies heavily on three things, the first of which is a heavy duty dose of suspending reality. This would include everything from the buddy relationship between George and Davis to the monstrous sized animals on hand. The second is the constant battering that a character like Davis takes without slowing down at any point. Short of Superman no one is that impervious to injury and pain. Lastly the special effects on display here are what drive most of the story. And they are amazing to see as the monsters rise up from regular size to huge altering along the way. The destruction that follows in their wake is also special effects at their best.The movie wouldn't work if you didn't have that human element there, that bond between Davis and George that makes the ape such a sympathetic character. The changes are not something he wants or has any idea of how to deal with. And whether or not the changes can be reversed is also up in the air as he heads toward Chicago. As viewers we feel for the ape and for Davis who might be faced with no other option than to take down the friend he made in George.The movie is pure popcorn fun and better than I expected. Hollywood has a history of messing up movies based on video games. They've done this one right though and the odds are that you'll have a blast watching this one. A movie the whole family can watch with a few minor items (like a single finger communication). This is one of those movies I think I could easily watch more than once.",Rampage

Yes, the film starts at a very low point and first 30 minutes are just Rock and his colleagues trying to figure out what happened to the animal and then soon when Naoime Harris arrived the movie started getting higher and higher! And then it became one of the best movies of the year! The movie is full of action, thriller, comedy and drama, in short all of the genres in one movie!

Dwayne does basically play the same type of guy in nearly all his movies which is fine just like Jason Statham does & you expect a certain type of character when they are in a movie.""RAMPAGE"" is a big fun sci-fi monster movie with three huge creatures running around a city destroying everything & those monsters are a giant Gorilla who is the good one who helps fight the others & a massive mutant Crocodile & a huge ferocious Wolf!!! The creatures look Amazing & the action is fast & furious.
""George"" the giant Albino Gorilla is the friendly beast & i like the sweet relationship between Dwayne Johnson's Character & George & that meana there's some nice touching moments between all the massive c.g.i fest of Action & destroyed buildings.

72,peterp-450-298716,A fun movie full of nonsense and total mayhem.,7,16 July 2018,"""Like my grandpappy always said: us assholes gotta stick together.""An obscure company conducting scientific experiments related to genetic manipulation on animals on a space station, get the horrible news something terrible has gone wrong. Then you see one of the female crew members getting away by means of an emergency capsule, while a terribly mutated rat is chasing her. And yes. She managed to secure some canisters with samples of the genetic material. Until the emergency capsule explodes and the samples end up on the earth. The result is a trio of random animals that bump into the canisters by accident and inhale a strange looking green smoke. And that is when trouble starts. The result is Chicago being reduced to rubble by the three cooperating giant monsters. Chased by the military and getting nuts due to some kind of radio signal that the obscure company broadcasts so they can regain the genetic material, the three primates leave a trail of destruction behind them.It all sounds pretty bizarre and ridiculous. ""Rampage"" isn't meant to be taken seriously and you should watch it with your mind turned off. But boy, what a joy to watch it as soon as hell breaks loose. Occasionally I like to watch such a pulp film. You can look at it as a mixture of ""San Andreas"" with ""Godzilla"" and a King Kong movie. And who to ask best to play the leading role in such a film? Exactly. Dwayne Johnson. Not exactly an actor who you'd associate with high-quality films. But since ""Jumanji: Welcome to the jungle"" I appreciate this guy and realize that he has more qualities than just inflated biceps and an impressive chest. Perhaps his acting is sometimes terribly exaggerated and it's filled with some bad jokes. But I admit that it's a pleasure to see the man at work. The enthusiasm and his empathy are phenomenal.However, the one who steals the show is the albino monkey, George. A computerized, motion-captured character who'll charm you from the start and guarantees some funny moments. It's a gorilla who masters sign language and who has a weird sense of humor. George fits perfectly with the rest of the film. It's utterly ridiculous and sheer nonsense packed in a destructive and action-rich whole. The supporting actors were already standing in George's shadow. But as this monkey starts to grow into something enormous and begins to slam things around, those supporting actors are really tiny, so to speak. The clash between the oversized George and the mutated alligator is brilliant and a joy to watch. It reminded me of those old monster movie like ""King Kong v. Godzilla "". A clash between two titans in the city of Chicago. A city turned into a battlefield with those two creatures creating havoc.""Rampage"" is no more than an exorbitant disaster film, full of spectacle and sometimes enjoyable humor. The film is overloaded with improbabilities, you don't pay attention to after a while because you automatically shift into a sort of nonsense mood. I still don't understand why this multinational didn't use a remote facility with heavy surveillance to perform these genetic experiments. And why lure those huge, destructive creatures towards you? When an arsenal of military missiles doesn't even cause a scratch, how were they going to get the genetic material? But again, don't pay attention to that so you can enjoy this blockbuster, full of graphic wizardry and spectacle. It's certainly worth it.",Rampage
73,aidanratesmovies,Yet another Video Game film hits the dust,3,15 February 2019,"Rampage is a complete waste of time, and most of all, a complete and utter trash hole of a film, as well as a shameful contender in the action genre. Between it's mediocre acting, Bay-like logic and effects, and weak storytelling, Rampage should have never even reached its pre production phase, and gives viewers another reason to stay away from films with starring Rock. The only redeeming quality this predictable, slightly boring, knockoff has going for it, is Jeffrey Dean Morgan's pointless but undoubtedly weird character that brings a strange amount of enjoyment to an otherwise bland film adaptation.

74,questl-18592,Mehpage,4,18 January 2021,"Rampage is a a big action movie, Rock-pick about gigantic animals that run amok on the world and wreck up the place until Johnson can lay the smack down. Now the biggest problem is that, with a premise like that, it takes itself too seriously. I would love to see the cut of this movie where everyone fully embraces the absurdity and goes full action movie bonkers with this.Don't get me wrong, this is still a fun time in it's own sense it's just not anywhere near as, to quote another Johnson film, ""straight up kooky-dooks"" as it should be.

This includes Rampage which my oldest son dragged me along to see today. 
Just read the synopsis that Fandango.com puts up about the film and you might see why I wasn't taken with it.A silverback gorilla, a wolf and a reptile grow to a monstrous size after a rogue genetic experiment goes wrong. Primatologist Davis Okoye soon joins forces with the military to prevent the mutated beasts from destroying everything in their path.Sounds stupid? well it's even more stupid than it sounds. 
This is a film that you could spend all day long picking holes at so it's best to shut the brain off at the door if you are going to get anything out of this. 
Incidentally my son is 15 and he loved it . I'm 50 this year and felt the opposite so you can see who this film is really aimed at.

78,jadepietro,Too Much Monkey Business,4,6 December 2018,"GRADE: C-THIS FILM IS NOT RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: Dwayne Johnson once again delivers an awful sci-fi action non-thriller.JIM'S REVIEW: I am on a bit of a rampage after seeing the dumb sci-fi fantasy thriller, Rampage. That this movie can be taken seriously by any pre-teen or, for that matter, anybody, is anybody's guess. Even more unexplainable is the fact that Dwayne (The Rock) Johnson is the No. 1 highest paid actor of 2018 after a string of god-awful movies to his discredit. Besides questioning the public's sense of good taste, one needs to just look to at Mr. Johnson's film legacy to see the decline in Western civilization and culture. Here are a few examples: Journey 2: The Mysterious Island, Baywatch, Skyscraper, Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle, San Andreas, and Central Intelligence. Rapture may not be his worst movie...paging Baywatch, but it is far from his best...if one does exists. (Well, there may be one, Moana, a well done animated film where he did fine voiceover work, if that counts.)Granted, the film never aimed as high art, but would it have been so hard to create a story, characters, and situations that were at least believable? The film was inspired by video games and the writers at fault are Ryan Engle, Carlton Cuse, Ryan J. Condal and Adam Sztykiel. Their lazy screenplay celebrates sophomoric humor and profanity-laden banter. An sample line of their witty dialog: ""I'm gonna knock you out so bad you're gonna urinate yourself."" And they even throw in an ape that gives the finger...really?The ludicrous story involves canisters that are filled with genetic altering chemicals that increase the size and aggression in three animals: a wolf named Ralph, a crocodile named Lizzie and an albino ape called George, who is not the least bit curious, but would look cute in a red t-shirt. It also involves our hero named Davis Okoye (Dwayne Johnson) , a primatologist who befriends George and communicates with him through sign language., which leads us to the question in any language...Just who is the bigger and smarter ape in this movie?The villains, and there are many, are written and played so one dimensionally. There's Claire Wyden, the power-hunger female executive (Malin Åkerman, bad), Brett, her dim-witted greedy brother (Jake Lacy, even worse), and Burke (Joe Manganiello), the mercenary. Some fortunately have less screen time than others. Only Naomie Harris as Davis sidekick, Dr. Kate Caldwell and the usually reliable Jeffrey Dean Morgan as Agent Harvey Russell, a governmental officer bring a semblance of character to their poorly written roles.The CGI is sub-par and has definite issues with proportioning and the detailing of the creatures, although the motion action is effective. The design of the creatures is crude and clunky. As Ralph and George reek havoc on the world, we get shaky close-ups of the carnage. Once Lizzie the Crocodile joins in, we get even more blurry edited action. (By the way, isn't it a tad odd that these marauding beasts are given names!) Director Brad Peyton does not stage the action very well and much is unintentionally laughable.Mr. Johnson's emotional range is as limited as his dialog, although he can make ""Well, that sucks!"" Sound convincing. For most of the film, he looks concerned, says ""Oh, no"" quite often, and runs around a lot. As each cliffhanging encounter unfolds, so does your patience with this lame blockbuster. All this leads to a never-ending climax that goes so silly, it just wears you out.Throughout the movie, our hero is asked, ""Why do you dislike people so much?"" Wrong question. Why don't more moviegoers dislike Rampage?",Rampage

80,rgkarim,"A Rampage of Comedy, CGI Effects, And Over the Top Dynamics",7,13 April 2018,"' Video game movies have a steady record of failing to meet expectations placed on them by the gaming community. Yet this year alone, two video game franchises have been unleashed on the screen with decent success and quality. Perhaps, this is the start of a video game movie renaissance, but in the world of movie magic, you never know what lies behind the community. So naturally I'm back in the trenches to provide to you another review as I cover: Movie: Rampage
Director:
 Brad Peyton
Writers:
 Ryan Engle and(Carlton CuseStars:
 Dwayne Johnson, Naomie Harris, Malin Akerman 
LIKES: The Acting: In a movie about giant monsters going on a rampage, it's up to the actors to try and put on a performance to make us believe they are nearly destroyed by these artificial creations. Fortunately, the Rock is able to deliver his magic again, not the best performance mind you, but believable enough to craft a relationship with the artificial monkey. Naomie Harris isn't too bad either, capable of expressing fear at the possible end of the world, but not so much past those components. Akerman has the vicious corporate tyrant face down, and the ice-cold stare of a woman perturbed with the hand fate dealt in her science experience, though flops at the end to maintain that edge. Finally, Jeffrey Dean Morgan is a champion at bringing comedic spark to the mix, a sarcastic modern day cowboy whose mannerism and wide smile will craft a more charming version of Negan. The Comedy: With Dwayne Johnson, you can always expect the film to have some comedy, and no surprise...Rampage delivers on this. Sure, the concept of the movie itself is hilarious enough, and even the acting/writing can be unintentionally comedic to leave you chuckling. However, the intended comedy comes primarily from the one liners packed into Johnson and Morgan's lines. Their rapier delivery is sharp, well-timed, and has just enough emphasis to maximize the sting these insults and lines bring. Throw in some of the vaudeville with George the CGI monkey that is cute, yet edgy, and you get some surprising laughs that you might not be expecting. The Graphics/Special Effects: No surprise, a movie about CGI behemoths needs good computer work and Rampage delivers on these hand over fist. Smooth animation, well-crafted realism, and some originality help bring these monsters to life on the big screen in a way that leave many with mouths agape. These titans of terror, have fantastic sound editing to go along with their visual prowess that brings everything together to unleash the full might of these beasts. As for the carnage itself, the special effects department delivers on this as well, combining pyrotechnics and manmade visuals to craft their visual representation of the classic arcade game. The effects themselves pay much homage to the platform they were built upon and in the last 40 minutes of the film, one will feel as if they have dived into that classic game. DISLIKES: The Cheesiness: Despite the concept itself being a major stretch, the movie had hopes for making the most out of it. They did to a level, but there were a lot of components that were still too ridiculous or forced to bare. Some of this includes the way the dialogue was delivered, the random plot elements thrown in, and even some of the chaos itself dropped a little over the top for me and my friends. And because of this stretch of the imagination, other components suffer such as the story, speaking of which. The Story: Okay it's based on a video game that had thread thin plot to being with, but that's no excuse to improve upon things in this day and age. Improvements were made to an extent, but the story lacks a lot of sustenance that could have helped craft a more engaging story. The character background information is minimal at best, built enough to provide introductions and some sense of internal conflict, but lacking in other departments to really make dynamic characters to grasp onto. Even worse, the pace of the movie is off, emphasizing how weak the story is at times and making it drag as it attempts to build up tension for the climax at the end when the hammer finally drops. Had these elements been tinkered with, perhaps we would have been more engrossed in the movie. More Action: You've stuck it out through the ridiculous plot, been teased by the small, and often pointless skirmishes, and you've gotten through the lacking characters. Now it's time for the epic battle, right? Wrong. Rampage's end game starts out so promising as the video game spectacle of army vs. beast unfolds in epic quality with the theater rattling in high amplitude sound. Then it kind of fizzles out, focusing on the human component for nearly fifteen minutes with no sign of the beasts. Had this part been more thought out, intricate, and exciting itself this would have worked, but since this wasn't the case it failed. When the beasts begin battling each other, this too needed more thought put into it to bring some originality and creativity to the battling behemoths. Given all the prep work for it, my friends and I were disappointed to not have more gusto behind this clash of the titans. The VERDICT: Rampage turned out better than I had expected, but the film still had much more to bring to the table to deliver on the expected promise of action. Comedy, acting and graphics were spot on in this big budget special effects piece, however they needed to use this budget to add more to the grand bout of carnage and fury. A lackluster story that succumbs to cheesiness and mundane tactics, Rampage needed to dig deeper to unlock the primitive energy locked up within. Perhaps a sequel will improve upon it and they will put more action into the next installment, but for now it's an okay starting point. Should you see it in theaters? For the effects lone yes, but this guy recommends holding out for some other spectacles coming in the near future. My scores are:
Action/Adventure/Sci-Fi: 7.5
Movie Overall: 6.0",Rampage
81,invisibleunicornninja,Pretty entertaining.,5,16 April 2018,"When I walked into the movie theater, I was expecting a fun dumb action movie with some decent effects and a solid performance from The Rock. I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. Its no masterpiece, sure, but it was extremely entertaining and did a lot of things very well. Plot - This story is kinda dumb, but its not taking itself too seriously. This movie is fast-paced and coherent. Sure, there are a few minor plot holes and a big middle finger held up towards things like logic and science, but its pretty consistent. I wouldn't really say that there are a lot of cliches in this movie, but it does get predictable at times. I'm ashamed to say that my friend and I were talking during the movie a lot (only loud enough that the people in the direct vicinity could maybe hear us, we tried to keep it down). More than once I was laughing at a dramatic moment going ""yeah no he's not dead, when the fight scene climaxes he's gonna jump out and save- yep there he is."" I wouldn't call that a spoiler because if you watch this movie, you'll soon realize that I could be referring to any fight scene involving the main characters. This movie may be predictable, but its really really entertaining. Characters - Most of the characters are actually developed pretty well. By the end of the movie, I cared about most of the people onscreen. There is a lot more drama than I was expecting, and most of its pretty good. Sure some lines are dumber than others, but for the most part the script is pretty good, as well as the acting. Pretty much everyone on the cast gave a convincing and entertaining performance. Sights and Sounds - The cinematography for this movie is actually pretty good. The effects are as well. All the monsters had a presence in this movie. You know that they're CGI because that's the only way they would be able to be in this movie, but at times I was forgetting that because of how well they fit into this world. A giant mutant wolf thing crashes into a skyscraper - and it looks like that's actually what's happening. I believe that The Rock is jumping out of an exploding plane. The action and the effects are all extremely well done. The Rating - I feel like in an earlier draft this movie was going to be rated R. There is a lot more swearing than I was expecting. Whenever someone is about to drop the f-bomb, they are comically censored by some in-movie effect like a cut between scenes or a crashing vehicle. There is also a lot more death than I was expecting. More than once someone dying is a punchline. I was laughing, sure, but I feel like this movie was supposed to be even more crude but was restrained by a PG-13 rating. There is a ridiculous amount of people dying, a lot of it played for laughs (well maybe not all of it but still) and this movie probably would've been slightly better if it had an R rating. Game Tie-Ins - I have played the game that this is based off of. This is one of the best movies based off of a game. I have seen and read reviews of other movies based off of games, and this is the only one that I know of that is this entertaining and well-executed. Most movies based off of games end up being terrible and stupid. If this movie was just being judged based off of other game movies, it would be the greatest movie ever made. Because other movies exist, it is objectively not that good, but it is still extremely entertaining. Product Placement - This doesn't have much to do with the movie, but I wanted to mention it. There is only one scene in this movie with an product placement (a lot less than I was expecting) and its only from one brand. What I'm referring to is during one of the action scenes and the monsters are destroying the city, there is a shot of them destroying buildings and among all the grey buildings, there is a giant logo for Dave and Busters (which was actually right next to the movie theater in the mall). I don't know why, but my friend and I found it hilarious.Overall I would recommend this movie if you want to be entertained. This is a funny action movie WITH NO ROMANCE SUBPLOT and I had a lot of fun watching this movie. If you are reading this review while its still in theaters, yes it is worth seeing on the big screen. There are no end credits scenes though, so don't waste your time waiting around for one.",Rampage
82,rannynm,"What it lacks in complexity, it makes up for in pure spectacle and fun!",7,13 April 2018,"Rampage is a healthy dose of CGI mayhem, anchored by the star power of Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson. What Rampage lacks in complexity and story, it makes up for through pure spectacle and fun.Rampage is loosely based on the classic arcade game of the same name and follows Davis Okoye (Dwayne Johnson), a primatologist (basically a monkey scientist) who takes care of a gorilla named George. Davis and George share a close bond with one another. When a sample of a mysterious substance lands in his enclosure, George inhales it. The good-natured gorilla turns into a building-sized behemoth. The same thing happens to a few other animals, making the threat even larger. With the help of a scientist with a tortured past and a sarcastic, Southern-accented government operative, Davis seeks out George to protect him from harm, while still trying to end the wrath of these animals.My favorite part of this film is the extended high-action showdown. This part reminds me of what made the game so fun: seeing these behemoths battle on an expansive urban playground where skyscrapers are like jungle gyms. We get to see the monsters battle each other and all the plot threads unfurl into monster madness. The supporting characters get some memorable character moments and Davis Okoye comes into his own as an action hero.Dwayne Johnson spews charisma with every line. So this, mixed with his great comedic timing, make him a good choice to play an action hero, which is exactly what he does here. Johnson makes lines that would normally sound poorly written and cheesy, quotable and cool. Johnson also brings to the screen Davis's bond with George well, considering one half of the pair is entirely CGI. Johnson also delivers certain lines that manage to poke fun at Rampage's insane concept. I recommend this film for ages 13 to 18 due to suggestive content, language and violence. Rampage is more violent than average blockbuster and, there are a few scenes that I had a hard time watching. If you are a fan of the arcade game, be sure to look out for some Easter eggs that tie the film back to its source material.I give Rampage 3.5 out of 5 stars. While not a cinematic masterpiece, if you're looking for a big-budget battle of large creatures with entertainment to spare, this film is for you. Reviewed by Benjamin P., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.

86,Abdulxoxo,Dumb but fun,6,14 February 2021,"The plot is set in motion as a result of the cheesy villains' genetic experiments. Why they were doing these experiments in the first place is not clear; but more importantly why there was a beacon signalling these creatures to come to destroy Chicago on the way to where, they, themselves were based. I also would question why they remained in the building for so long while the creatures were getting closer. This movie is littered with apparently smart people making stupid decisions. One such character was Dr Kate Caldwell the geneticist who created the pathogen in the first place. she finds herself following Davis on his mission to save George/stop the creatures. I felt like her character barely had a mind of her own, as she spent most of the movie staring at Davis, basically asking what they were going to do or where they were going to go next. Davis wasn't much brighter either. Many of the decisions he made would usually have resulted in the injuries or deaths of himself, Dr Caldwell and heaps of other people too. One scene where he has a light bulb moment of how to escape a roof with a helicopter was so stupid. But on the plus side, Rampage has some really good visual effects. I actually quite enjoyed the final 20 or so minutes where I felt like the CGI work was fantastic. George the gorilla in particular looked great. The other thing I enjoyed was the relationship between George and Davis. The two clearly had a strong bond, evidenced by the way they would banter using sign language. Those scenes were great for giving us the tiniest reason to care about anyone in the movie. They were also pretty funny too.
All in all, Apart from the impressive CGI and The Rock's sign language banter with his gorilla friend, this movie was barely average.",Rampage

88,Troy_Campbell,"Starts strong, but goes down hill in a hurry.",4,18 April 2018,"Ingredients: three cups of genetically-enhanced, building-sized creatures, a tablespoon of Dwayne Johnson, a sprinkle of recognisable faces hamming it up, a pinch of humour, two pinches of earnestness, and one major city needing to be saved. Instructions: throw all ingredients together with zero care. Add more Dwayne Johnson until texture is passable. Cook until burnt out. Ice with more Dwayne Johnson. It doesn't take a genius to identify the sole reason this movie was made. At the height of his popularity right now, Johnson's involvement alone was enough for this disaster flick to proceed; a decent script, action choreography, and visual effects merely optional extras. For a while it looks very promising. A nifty little Gravity-meets-Alien pre-title opening sequence is unexpected but encouraging, followed by an amusing introduction to primatologist Davis Okoye (Johnson) and his endearing gorilla pal George. There's even a fun Predator-esque jungle set piece-complete with the film's standout slow-mo money shot-to close out the first act. But from there it rapidly descends into a final hour of uninspired and uninventive blockbuster-by-numbers dross. The central gimmick of over-sized animals tearing up everything in their path is lazily executed; the scale of the creatures fluctuate wildly, the CGI falters in key scenes and the mass-destruction action pales in comparison to recent Kong and Godzilla outings. The tone sporadically shifts without notice too, at times appearing like it's aware this is a completely silly movie that deserves a tongue-in-cheek approach, at other times heavy-handedly leaning into emotional moments expecting to be taken seriously. The naturally charismatic Johnson tries his hardest as usual, but gets underwhelming support. Jeffrey Dean Morgan pops in to do his one-size-fits-all portrayal of, well, Jeffrey Dean Morgan, whilst Malin Akerman and Jake Lacy, playing the villains, shoot to the top of the list of 2018's worst performances.

89,pyrocitor,Wreck-It Dwayne,6,23 April 2018,"""Why. So. Serious?"" If any phrase has singularly hit the critique nail on the head for blockbusters of the last decade, it's Heath Ledger's iconic epitaph. For years after his swan song performance, those three words distilled to the most succinct film criticism, and a means of instantly calling out a slew of dopey Hollywood escapist romps, which, bloated with unwanted 'grittiness' and an overbearing sense of self-importance, obstinately refuse to just be FUN. Rampage, thankfully, isn't quite as big an offender, but it's treading dangerous thin ice. Adapting an arcade game where giant monsters break crap seems transparently like the sort of dumb, low-concept property designed to be bolstered by the artist-formerly-known-as-Rock's unquenchable charisma - and, in its best (and mostly climactic) moments, Rampage is cheerfully that, no strings attached. Unfortunately, it's a trek to the smashy smashy, with a disappointingly straight, mannered telling, disappointingly at odds with the film's indisputable popcorn stupidity. Rampage the arcade game was a classic of unleashing the id. Players, embodying humans mutated into giant, monstrous animals, were encouraged to destroy as much of the game's nameless city as possible in a glorious gluttony of cathartic rage. On paper, it sounds like perfect fodder for a post-Roger Corman B-movie romp, a cheese buffet befitting the age of Sharknado. Here, it seems the joke is on us, with a budget and production values as high as the concept is low, including the full force of Lord of the Rings' Weta Workshops. Rampage's monsters look... really, really cool. And watching them chomp into each other and turn a city block into a parking lot is stupendously satisfying. Fights are vicious, survivors bloodied and managed, and the entire smackdown is infused with the kind of concussive weight and sense of consequence that most CGI slugfests spend millions more striving for. In fact, it's almost grotesque how vast the discrepancy is between how good the film looks and how simple and stupid it is. But, fun is fun, even indulgently expensive fun. Right? Unfortunately, in the words of Jeff Bridges in (similarly dumb-'n-fun) R.I.P.D.: ""Ya gotta earn that."" Thus, swept along with the gloriously expensive carnage is (gasp) an accompanying solemn sense of self-importance (nooooo!). And thus, after a momentarily elating prologue in an exploding space shuttle, we're treated to loooooooots of time to get to know our human (boring!) protagonists. The problem? They're all 8-bit archetypes cluttered with extraneously overcomplicated traumatic backstories involving special forces PTSD and dead relatives, that, frankly, aren't that compelling. Precious moments that could be devoted to a gigantic, frilled, gator-boar-dragon massacring boats of helpless people are squandered on countless redundant cutscenes of instantly forgettable military grunts scowling, and tearful confessions in cornfields. Instead of the (far more interesting and fun) source premise of normal people going berserk mutated into monstrous beasts and lashing out in feral rage, Rampage is muzzled with dour animal conservation and anti-poaching subplots. Director Brad Peyton's telling is so robust and earnest that it's almost tempting enough to buy in - until reality kicks in, and we realize a movie called Rampage, unsurprisingly, isn't going to convince anyone to save the gorillas. And putting in so much painstaking work attempting to contextualize and justify the film's wafer-thin premise ultimately detracts from the fun.Still, a little Rock goes a long way, and we get full value Dwayne firing on all cylinders here. He mostly plays it straight, signing like a credible primatologist, and it's impossible to imagine any other performer selling his strange buddy-cop relationship with George the gigantic albino gorilla more credibly and adorably. Still, false delusions of grandeur or not, that charisma can't be contained. And when he allows his customary twinkle flit back into his eyes as he spouts joyfully silly punchlines, or lets loose with a grenade launcher, howling with brawny bravado, or overpowers foolish foot soldiers with laughable ease, are the moments the film comes to life the most. Our dear Miss Moneypenny, Naomie Harris, tries her best to live up to his Rock-ness, but her love-interest-scientist feels superfluous even for a film this superficial. She's fun, and distinctly out-performs the material, but her best attempts at grim personal trauma or comic relief wisecracking feel somewhat sour and undercooked. Malin Ackerman's flinty corporate scoundrel is as bland as they come, and instantly forgettable, though Jake Lacy is more fun as her goofball brother/co-conspirator. Still, Jeffrey Dean Morgan knows exactly how much scenery to chew as a curiously overstaying fed, with a cowboy twang worthy of Sam Elliot, and he's surprisingly entertaining for it.  We walk into Rampage eagerly expecting the plucky, action-packed silliness of 2017's Kong: Skull Island, but emerge with a film so top-heavy with sodden portentousness, sparse spectacle, and banal military jingoism that it tips dangerously close to the grim train wreck of 2014's Godzilla. But, when Peyton lets them fight, Rampage lives up to its name, with grandiose, dopey destruction bar none. Still, if we're going to have a budget this excessive, is it too much to hope for the spectacle to match it: more ridiculous, excessive destruction, more creative big things for the immense albino gorilla to smack its peers with - and without unwanted, unnecessary navel-gazing? Having blowouts this well-realized but cramped into the finale and sidelined for so many boring humans talking feels like running out of quarters at the arcade on the cusp of beating your high score. -6.5/10",Rampage

93,one9eighty,A 'leave your brain at the door' action film,6,31 January 2019,"A scientific space station testing a substance, codename Rampage, has a problem and is about to explode. The last remaining scientist attempts to save some of the test formula and eject herself with it back to Earth but things go wrong. The formula crash lands on earth in three different locations, but due to damage, the containers it's held in are broken so when unsuspecting animals inspect the crash, they get infected by Rampage. 3 animals are thus infected; a crocodile, a wolf, and a gorilla. Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson plays Davis Okoye, Primatologist and ex-special forces soldier. He is the carer of George, the gorilla who gets infected. He will do everything in his power to save George, and as events of the film unfold, it becomes a race against time (and occasionally George) to stop the infected animals from rampaging Chicago and bring it to rubble. He's not alone, he's got help from disgraced Dr Kate Caldwell (Naomie Harris), who once worked for the company who developed Rampage; and from Agent Harvey Russell (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) who works for an OGA (other government agency) trying to save America from scientific disasters.I came into this film knowing that it was based on a retro video game that I remember vividly from my youth. The game wasn't complex: smash, bash, crash - and try and bring down the city - and as such I expected the film to be similar. In truth it was. It was more of an action film than a film with a deep and meaningful script. More about destruction than character development - If you go into the film expecting anything more than carnage and chaos you will be disappointed. This is a no-brainer, popcorn action movie, with clichés galore, dumb comedy, and lots of destruction.I'm awarding this 6 out of 10. It's decent, but could be better. It didn't tarnish my memory of the video game, but it didn't enhance my memories of love for it. As far a cinematic experience goes, this won't be rejoiced over for years to come, but it doesn't hurt to watch it either.",Rampage
94,bettycjung,Gene editing gone awry - see this one!,8,15 April 2018,"4/15/18. I saw this in 2D and it was great. You got to see this one on the big screen! Overall, this is a popcorn movie. However, I like the sci-fi aspect that drove the plot - gene editing gone awry. In real life, gene editing is in its infancy and scientists are looking into applications, but the science remains very controversial. Those involved with CRISPR now hawk the capabilities to correct genetic mistakes that result in congenital diseases while the possibility of designer babies is not too far from the minds of scientists interested in cashing in. The recent movie, The Titan, showed how gene editing could be used to change humans so they can adapt to long distance space travel. Sounds like a noble idea, right? Yet that movie raised many ethical questions about this new technology. If you can change a human that can no longer live on Earth, is it still human? Here gene editing is used to create weaponized creatures that can wreak havoc, all to make money. Totally plausible but extremely scary. In real life much of the advancement in gene editing has been cloaked in secrecy, so the movies are really great in raising the possibilities and questions about how this science should advance, given the ethical issues it raises. That's really what Science Fiction was always meant to do, whether in print or on the screen. Definitely catch it. Another Rock hit. Harris was very good, as was the rest of the supporting cast. Morgan had too much of his Walking Dead swagger to avoid the connection between this character and that one. You decide.",Rampage
95,rockman182,Rampage (2018),7,19 April 2018,"I never played the classic video game and actually hadn't heard of it prior to seeing the trailer for the film. For me this looked like San Andreas (primarily because of The Rock and mass city destruction), but even better. I love giant monster movies, no matter how brainless they are. I love King Kong so when I saw that this involved a giant gorilla, I was so in. Add to that a massive crocodile, and a flying wolf?? Hyped. After watching it, its not perfect or anything smart but it brings the fun and is a better large scale destruction film than any of the recent Transformers.The film is about a primatologist (The Rock) who notices that his friendly albino gorilla is infected by a pathogen. This causes the gorilla to go berserk and grow larger. The same occurs with a wolf and a crocodile and soon the trio wreak havoc on the city. Davis, the primatologist must try to take down the corporation behind the destruction and also find an antidote to save his primate friend before the city is destroyed. The film also stars Naomie Harris, Jeffrey Dean Morgan, and Malin Akerman.The film is dumb no doubt about it. The dialogue sucks and is cheesy at times. Its fun though. Its easy to like George (the gorilla) no matter how un-realisitic things are. The exposure to the pathogen and the chaos caused by the genetically edited animals is fun to watch. The passages in the middle with the generic villains talking about how they want control and all that jazz is stale. There are a lot of cookie cutter moments in the middle that I didn't care for but the action delivers.The thing is, its not just mindless action like in Transformers. There is enough going on to follow the simple story so it works on a simple level of entertainment (that cannot be said for the latest Transformers entries). The Rock is also a charismatic enough leading man, and Jeffry Dean Morgan complements well. Its not a perfect movie or a ""good movie"" but it does enough to be a fun popcorn film.

98,Benjamin-M-Weilert,Another poorly-executed video game movie.,3,8 March 2019,"I didn't go into this movie expecting much, and it still disappointed me. Seems like every time some Hollywood studio gets their hands on a video game franchise and decides to turn it into a movie, this is the kind of thing we get. I wouldn't be so mad about it except that nothing in this film seems anywhere close to original at all. In fact, it seems to be cobbled together from summer movie blockbuster clichés and tropes, almost like a CGI-heavy Frankenstein. What's probably worse is that it could have been somewhat passable if it held to the source material.There's a weird kind of disconnect when a movie like Rampage (2018) has an actual arcade cabinet of the game it's based on in the background of the corporate penthouse suite. Like, did they do this genetic-engineering research and name it ""Rampage,"" fully knowing that they'd create the exact creatures from the game? In any case, the whole plot is contrived and plays out exactly how you think it would. If only they had Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson's character turn into an enormous white ape and destroy half of Chicago, then that'd be something I'd want to watch.One of the most significant problems with Rampage, aside from its sub-par CGI, is that the whole reason to even get to the point where monsters are destroying buildings (which was the entire point of the video game) was so poorly-thought-out as to be laughable. Like, what did they think was going to happen? Furthermore, once these monsters accomplished their destructive mayhem-the most satisfying part of the movie, by the way-you realize that it took pretty much the entire film to get to a 10-minute segment that lived up to its source material.Another poorly-executed video game movie, I give Rampage 1.5 stars out of 5.",Rampage
99,RforFilm,"Like the video game, Rampage is a mindless fun popcorn movie. It could have benefited from being more self aware",6,17 April 2018,"Who remembers the Rampage arcade game? The one where you play as either a giant ape, giant lizard, or a giant wolf where your goal was to destroy a city as much as possible until you lose all of your health. This was a game that was not only fun, but combined the simplicity of games like Asteroids, Pac-Man, and Mortal Kombat with a giant monster attack. What kids wouldn't love this kind of game. Like a lot of games, there was no point, but it was entertaining. Rampage was something I would seek out at every pizza place arcade. Making a movie out of that isn't impossible, but would require someone who understands the comical and popcorn-like entertainment that Rampage was. The other problem is that most video game movies are not that good. With the exceptions of Mortal Kombat and maybe Professor Layton and the Eternal Diva, video game movies can't seem to either stretch the button mashers into stories or can't take a hundred of playable story and condense it into two hours. But with Rampage's monster movie-like concept, this has got to be the one to break the mold, right? Well...let's see what Rampage has. Primatologist Davis Okoye (played by Dwayne Johnson) overlooks the gorilla enclosure at the San Diego Wildlife sanctuary, but puts a lot of focus on a rare albino gorilla named ""George"". Davis has taught George sign language and has even made friends with him, ensuring behavioral control. One evening, a canister crash lands in the enclosure, causing George to be exposed to a gaseous pathogen. When Davis returns the next morning, he finds George to be bigger and more aggressive. While under observation, Davis is visited by Dr. Kate Caldwell (played by Naomie Harris) who reveals that the inside of the canisters were from an gene manipulation company, Energyne.Energyne's CEO Claire Wyden (played by Malin Åkerman) had developed the pathogen to use as a biological weapon. She turns on a radio signal that lures George, and two other other animals that were exposed to canisters, a wolf from Wyoming, and a crocodile from the everglades, to Chicago. With all three grown to ridiculous size and with the power to level cities, Davis and Kate, along with the help of CIA agent Harvey Russell (played by Jeffrey Dean Morgan) race to get to Chicago.In terms of the video game's mindless plot, Rampage pretty much delivers the same idea of monsters destroying a city. Rampage does seem to be aware of how ridiculous it's story is and goes with it. This pretty much means that the movie is a blockbuster with a B movie premise. I only wished that the movie was much more self-aware. B movies work when not only do they embrace the chaotic nature of it's plot, but manages to have fun with it. Rampage only has moments of that. Though I guess I should expect it, I was surprised by how much attempted drama and backstory was set up involving the gorilla George and Dwayne Johnson's character. While I appreciate trying to build up this world, this could have cut much of it in favor of getting to what the people really come for; mindless destruction.B movies are basically exploitation movies; their not striving to win awards, but to give audiences memorable fun. Once Rampage gets to the three animals destroying Chicago, the movie does get enjoyable. Unlike a Transformers movie, which would have stretched it to over two and a half hours, this is not a long movie, feeling like that once it reaches it's high point, it ends nicely.I guess I shouldn't complain too much. Apart from being an adaptation of a video game, this is also a Dwayne Johnson movie. At this point, he is pretty much playing himself. He's got a name and a character, but this something that I feel like Arnold Schwarzenegger would have done in the 1990's. Johnson has a lot of charm and charisma that does make watching him just as fun as the monsters. Some of the CGI can look fake (and not rendered fully), but the film doesn't overuse it. I'll give this six screens of the Rampage video game out of ten. This serves as a passable popcorn movie at best. At worst, it's a little ambitious with it's ideas of combining drama with it's B movie feel. I had some fun watching it. It could have used more self-aware humor I might have found from a Roger Corman or Troma film. While I'm not going ape over this, I certainly feel like I saw a video game.",Rampage

The creature stuff is decent, but the character stuff is paper-thin. Johnson plays the kind of hero who is decent, brave, cool, competent and always right.

What REALLY matters in these kinds of films is the action and the CGI that is used to create these actions - and both of them are pretty good - at least, good enough.Director Brad Peyton teams up again with The Rock (they were together for SAN ANDREAS and JOURNEY 2), so he knows not to linger too long on anything.

Brad Peyton directs the screenplay by a team of writers led by Ryan Engle (""The Commuter"", ""Non-Stop""). This film reunites star Dwayne Johnson with his ""San Andreas"" & ""Journey 2: The Mysterious Island"" director.Johnson is Davis Okoye, a primatologist who works at an animal preserve in San Diego and takes care of an intelligent albino silverback gorilla named George. Davis is a former U.S. Army special forces soldier who became the leader of an anti-poaching unit in Rwanda where he saved George's life when the gorilla was very young. Davis raised George, taught him sign language and bonded with him emotionally.When George is accidentally exposed to a toxin which alters animal genes, he begins to grow at an alarming rate and become more aggressive. Scientist Dr. Kate Caldwell (Oscar nominee Naomi Harris) shows up to explain what's happening to George and who's to blame. Davis and Kate join forces to save George from those who want to capture and/or kill him (including Jeffrey Dean Morgan as a government fixer) - and to save people and property from harm by George - and some similarly afflicted animals. ""Rampage"" is a mindless monster movie... but it's also mildly enjoyable. It's a low-rent combination of ""King Kong"", ""Godzilla"" and the ""Jurassic Park"" movies. The villains are all cardboard cutouts and the heroes aren't developed much better as characters. The action is fun to watch, but it doesn't make a lot of sense, nor does much of the plot.

Dwayne Johnson who plays David Okoye is in exactly the type of role you'd expect. Naomi Harris is Kate Caldwell and rather spoiling her cv in this movie. There is supposed to be some romantic chemistry between these 2, but didn't really see any suggestion of this throughout the movie. Anyway you could probably find the script on a piece of paper inside an Xmas cracker. Three creatures take on gigantic proportions and set about killing off mankind about sums it up.The special effects aren't really that good either. Just a chance that some 7-10 year olds may enjoy this, but everyone else should skip it.",Rampage
107,Vivekmaru45,The film is loosely based on the city-smashing game of the same name by Midway Games,5,1 September 2018,"I saw the trailer first before watching the film. I am not a very big fan of the Rock(Dwayne Douglas Johnson) as an actor, however I respect all that he has achieved as a wrestler. I prefer to watch his comedy roles in films rather than his action roles.That said, back to reviewing this film. It belongs to the big-monster movie genre. Commonest examples are the King Kong and Godzilla movies. Later on the Spielberg directed the dinosaur film Jurassic Park 1993 that became the box-office number one movie of that year.The plot consists of a banned genetic test done aboard a space-lab which goes awry. The lab explodes in space, however debris consisting of a mutating chemical agent land on earth at various locations and are consumed by animals. Watch the film to find out what happens next...Verdict: the action sequences are good and the movie fails from becoming a bore. Dwayne Johnson gives a very good performance as the lead actor. Alongside him Naomie Harris also gives a good acting performance.",Rampage
108,markthomassintek,"Kids will love this film, adults not so much but it is escapism.",7,13 April 2018,"REVIEW - RAMPAGEI enjoy watching films and I especially enjoy writing these reviews. By far the hardest part of writing these is to make them interesting. Now being an adult I can use adult conceptions, interpretations and vocabulary that other adults can comprehend, by now your possibly thinking what is he going on about this is supposed to be a film review. You have a film which is rated as 12A here in the UK, so children can see it from 12 upward when accompanied by an adult, with this in mind you may think that the people making the film would take into consideration the prospective audience, a story for the children with something for the adults. With a rating of 12A this film was, in my personal opinion not suitable for a 12 year old. There are some inappropriate gestures used which if copied by a 12 year old would cause offence and one scene where 'us' gets eaten is very in your face. Special effects are as to be expected excellent, story is (for an adult) silly especially when the rock gets...... and less than 10 minutes later is running, fighting, rolling around ETC.Kids will love this film, adults not so much but it is escapism.The stereo types are cringe worthy with a Tommy Lee Jones, a Die Hard and the usual female scientist who just happens to know about what's going on and how to....... and who wasn't for some reason disposed of prior? Certainly go see it, make your own mind up, enjoy the time with your kids but remind them not to copy certain gestures.Rating 7 out of 10",Rampage
109,Snootz,Sophomoric nonsense,4,2 July 2018,"Cliches, sophomoric script, breaks the wall of believable plot lines. This is a pure monster movie with ""The Rock"" as the center of attention. I'm sure the adrenaline junkies will give this 10 stars right and left. CGI is great (of course... that's nothing unusual these days), but grade-school humor and predictable plot makes this an asinine attempt with a whole bunch of stupid thrown in. The military could not be dumber, the characters more cliche, the use of weaponry more unbelievable. Don't hit the monsters with guided drone missiles. Nooooo... instead get your copter REAL close to the thing and pea-shoot it. Repeatedly, despite previous identical-attempt failures.Seriously, while a roller-coaster ride from beginning to end and well-filmed ... it is at the same time unbelievable from beginning to end. It's like eating cotton candy; tastes fantastic but zero nutritional substance. The ending is so vapid it causes the preceding stupid to look smart in comparison. Anyone expecting more than a violent and senseless romp from this film is going to be disappointed. They missed absolutely every opportunity to put some emotional content into this film and went for the MUSCLE every time. Bleh. I almost went into a sugar coma just watching the pure corn syrup pouring out of this film. This is juvenile ""let's eat pie and cake all the time!"" mentality, no substance.",Rampage
110,pietclausen,Good old fashioned entertainment,7,8 July 2018,"Hooray, at last a movie that one can enjoy and be fully satisfied with the story and be thoroughly entertained.Let the moaners moan and give it low ratings for whatever reason, but this fun and light-hearted movie was right up my tree.",Rampage
111,kjproulx,"A Dumb, Yet Fun Popcorn Flick",6,14 April 2018,"Movies like Rampage hit the big screen many times each year, but they never stand out from the rest, because they're meant to appeal to the lowest of demographics. Kids between the ages of 10 and 16 fall in love with movies like this and then ask themselves why about 10 years later. That being said, Rampage has a little extra flair this time around, due to the star power in Dwayne Johnson. He has become the man to open movies as of late and honestly one of the few remaining big movie stars. Audiences seem to love everything he does, even if they love him for the fact that you're not supposed to take him very seriously. Rampage is exactly the movie that you expect it to be when watching the trailers, but here's why you may get a little more out of it in terms of entertainment.Based on the popular arcade game that was made famous decades ago, Rampage follows the military, animal trainers, and scientists as they track down and prevent catastrophe after an experiment goes wrong and multiplies the size and anger of a few animals. Yes, the premise is as silly as it sounds when talking about it, so you definitely have to go in ready for a corny ride from beginning to end. With that said, when certain characters say silly lines of dialogue, everything is still taken fairly seriously, so if you can sit back and have a good time with a dumb popcorn flick, then this may be the movie for you.Dwayne Johnson will continue to be the big star that he is for years to come because his on-screen charm doesn't seem to be going anywhere, at least anytime soon. I would recommend going to see this film for his interaction with everyone, yes, but his relationship with the main genetically-enhanced animal in George is great. This relationship is what will make or break the movie for you because the driving force of the story lies with these two characters. The final act of the movie is all about the culmination of where they started together at the beginning of the film, so if their chemistry doesn't work for you, then you may want to leave the theatre before it really dives in.This is where I'll dive into my negatives with this film, even though there really aren't many to discuss. The main issues are that the story itself is very familiar and the jokes have been told throughout countless blockbusters throughout the past. This is just about as safe as you can possibly make a movie like this, so I walked out not really complaining but wishing it provided much more than it did. The action is fun and the effects are surprisingly detailed and realistic, but the spectacle is really all this film has to offer for its audience.In the end, there isn't another way of saying it other than stating that this film is exactly what you are expecting it to be. Animals are mutated and destroy the city. You care about one of them and hope that Dwayne Johnson's character in Davis can work with him to stop everything from getting worse and I'll leave the rest up to your imagination. The conclusion you're probably coming up with is most likely what happens here. Yes, the charisma of Johnson is great, the secondary characters are likable enough, and I can really see this movie appealing to young teenagers, so it does receive a mild recommendation from me, but if you're looking for something innovative in terms of Hollywood blockbusters, then I would suggest looking elsewhere. If you're in for a dumb, but fun ride, then I think you'll appreciate it for what it is like I did.",Rampage
112,kuarinofu,You get what you expect / A more detailed look,7,29 July 2018,"I mean, come on, a movie based on an old arcade game (I actually played PS1 Rampage World Tour when I was a kid)?.
Turn down your expectations, sit back, relax and enjoy this movie. It's stupid, most of dialogue makes you cringe, it really doesn't make any sense (and I'm not talking about realism at all) because it shouldn't.
Given the source material, I don't think they could've done a better job with this movie. CGI was good most of the time, they really did a good job with a budget that isn't even considered big nowadays for Hollywood production. 
It starts pretty generic, with lots of cliches and stupid/expository dialogue, but it's ok. Some good laughs here and there. Some really funny performances, like you can see Jeffrey Dean Morgan really enjoying this.
The second act kind of starts taking itself too seriously and it gets a little boring but not for long. I'm glad that I watched it till the end cause the ending (even being absolutely predictable) was probably the best part of the movie. They finally got creative with some of the CGI rendered scenes and it worked OK for me.
One thing I want to mention specifically is The Rock. Getting him cast into this movie IMO saved it. His charisma and his chemistry with George (the gorilla) works and it even provides for some good laughs. I should also mention that this movie has some good unintentional laughs as well, yet I think the movie is self-aware on that.
I don't know why someone thought that this is a good idea to spend money on, but given the end product - it sure did work for me.
P.S. George, I saw you eating people with joy, you're not getting away with this so easily.",Rampage

Yes, it is a silly plot, and totally unbelievable - yet we are not asked to believe it - we are asked to trust Dwayne and the rest to take us to a place of genuine entertainment. And it WAS genuinely entertaining.That is enough to ask of any movie. We were NOT talked-down-to, or otherwise patronized with, as I said above, hipster conceit. To paraphrase the great Greta Gerwig - none of this could have happened, of course, but it is all ""true.""Go see it with an open mind and a desire for loopy, goofy, exciting fun. You will not be disappointed.",Rampage
114,Darkside-Reviewer,Rampaging Ego,4,19 May 2021,"Rampage (2018) is one of the most idiotic and insulting action/monster movies I've ever seen. The movie is based on the classic arcade video game of the same name released in 1986. The game itself was a standard beat em up style side scroller where the player took control of a monster which rampages through the city destroying buildings and vehicles. So how exactly did filmmakers take an 8 bit arcade classic and turn it into a big budget blockbuster?. Simple they hired the Rock and based the entire movie around his ego and a few mutated creatures who do nothing but destroy buildings and eat people.The movies ""plot"" if you can call it that is about a bunch of animals who become exposed to a experimental pathogen that mutates their DNA making them stronger, more intelligent, more aggressive and causes them to grow too monsterous proportions. One of the animals exposed to pathogen is a silver back gorilla named George who has a unique bond with a primatologist named David Okoye (Dwayne Johnson). The two people responsible for creating the pathogen want the monsters DNA to create even more monsters so they activate a special sonar satellite dish that only the monsters can hear due to their mutation which drives them wild drawing them the signals source to destroy it. David along with a genetic engineer named Dr. Kate Caldwell (Naomie Harris) track George and the other animals as they rampage across the city towards the signals source hoping they can save George the gorilla before he kills more innocent people. David and Kate find themselves up against a pair of idiotic siblings who created the virus while also going up against the army aswell a trio of giant mutated animals.On paper this just sounds like another silly action movie but it's actually far worse than that. Not only does this movie contain some of the most idiotic and utterly ridiculous characters you can imagine in a movie like this but the movie contains a lot of unfunny attempts at humour most of which is just Dwayne Johnson belittling the movie's other male characters. Dwayne Johnsons character is just an egotistical bully in this movie as he often humiliates almost every other male character in this movie to the point where the movie tries making Dwayne Johnson look like he's gods gift to woman. I get that this is just a character and it isn't actually based on Dwayne Johnson as a person but still his character is like every school bully combined into one giant duchbag.The special effects are somewhat decent and the giant monsters don't look all that bad sadly it doesn't amount to much when all they really do is trample over and destroy buildings then have an anticlimactic fight in the last ten minutes of the movie.I seriously don't recommend watching this sorry excuse for a monster movie it's one of the worst monster movies I've ever seen and it seems to only exist to make Dwayne Johnson slightly richer with an even bigger ego than he had before.",Rampage
115,msbreviews,Rating: C-,4,22 April 2018,"If you enjoy my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)I discovered that Rampage was actually based on an arcade game a few days before watching the movie. When I saw what the game was about, I was 90% sure this was not going to be a ground-breaking story ... And I wasn't wrong.A lot of exposition scenes bring down what was surprisingly being a touching narrative. Unfortunately, it's boring and uninventive until the last act. It follows everything you would expect from an action-monster blockbuster. The protagonists survive ridiculously implausible falls or explosions, expecting the audience to turn off their brains in order to believe the unbelievable.Brad Peyton shows good camera handling and an excellent use of the visuals which definitely improve the monsters' fights. I mean, the action is amazing as expected but that means nothing to me if there's no substance or real stakes to back them up. He ruins the tone with several silly tries at a Marvel move (jokes at the end of a serious moment) but they all fall flat. Also, he misleads the viewers into thinking he is going for a bold ending (which would make the film better) and then he backs off to make another stupid joke. That's as annoying as it's frustrating!However, my main issue with the movie and the thing that completely took me off of it is the villains. The main characters are well-developed (even if solely through exposition) but the villains are horrible. Really, really awful and if that wasn't enough, Jake Lacy and Malin Akerman's performances are able to turn an absurd script in something even worse. Their displays are extremely over-the-top and incredibly irritating just as the characters they portray.Nevertheless, Rampage has a few points in its favor (even if it's still not a good film). With the exception of the actors mentioned in the above paragraph, the casting is pretty great. Dwayne Johnson proves that he is a multi-layered actor and that there is no one better to lead an action blockbuster than him. He didn't turn out to a typecast actor like I thought he would and for that, I have to congratulate him.Naomie Harris is great as well as Jeffrey Dean Morgan, who lends his instant coolness to every single scene. Sadly, I think he is going in the way I thought The Rock would go. He basically plays a different version of Negan ... It's not like I don't enjoy it (I mean, it's Jeffrey Dean Morgan, damn it!), I just hope that he doesn't settle down and accept every single typecasting from now on.The visuals are exceptional, they truly are. The monsters are beautiful to look at and their fights are jaw-dropping. The problem is that the audience only receives that massive destruction in the last 20-25 minutes ... The CGI is remarkable throughout the entire runtime, the monsters are amazingly well-blended into the environment. However, when Dwayne Johnson joins them, it either looks like a video game or the green screen is extremely noticeable (and don't ask me when, just watch the last trailer).The pacing is more than adequate for a movie like this. I can't exactly say I felt bored. I just felt annoyed at the dreadful script and at the fact that they could have actually made something really cool with the core story and the characters. It's another film that is going to be loved by the mainstream audience, who just want visually astounding monsters to fight each other and a huge bag of popcorn to shove down their throats.If you turn off your brain, you will enjoy it for the action (even if there isn't much of it), the main characters/actors and its visuals. If you don't, then you'll not only find a conventional narrative but everything that comes with the genre: cliche annoying villains, laughable plot points/devices and implausible action sequences.",Rampage
116,apryla-58795,"""Of course the wolf flies""",7,2 December 2018,"This movie jumped the shark so many times I lost track BUT its got The Rock so it was kinda low key a fun ride.I have never played the video game this is based on so I can't review whether or not the movie closely stuck to the game or not BUT I'm gonna go out on a limb and guess that this movie took a lot of liberties with the premise...just a strong hunch.So even though I've never played the game here is my summary/review.Two bad people (Malin Ackerman) and Jake Lacy (who by the way I loved in How to be Single but then proceeded to hate in everything else he's been in) want to make money at any cost so they mess with some science stuff that makes the recipient of whomever gets exposed to it bigger, faster and extremely volatile. A gorilla, a wolf and an alligator accidentally get exposed to this substance after it falls from the sky due to a space mission gone south.The animals proceed to wreak havoc all over and of course The Rock has to save the day. He does it with the help of George the gorilla he saved from poachers when George was just a baby. They communicate through sign language and have a close bond. George changes after being exposed to this stuff and basically turns into a prepubescent teenager.There's an antidote (because of course) and DJ and Naomie Harris (a Doctor who used to work for MA & JL until she got fired for trying to shut down their program after she discovered they weren't gonna use it for good. Her brother died of cancer and what she was working on might have saved him but she got fired before she could complete her work) have to get it.Meanwhile the military is getting ready to bomb most of Chicago in order to kill these mutant animals and the two nefarious bad people are threatening DJ & NH's lives. DJ gets shot.Lots of stuff gets blown up & people get killed but then DJ and George defeat the alligator and everything goes back to neat.I've seen better but I've definitely seen much worse. I rated it higher because it was funny and it gave me and my husband something to laugh about. I have no doubt we will be uttering the line ""of course the wolf flies"" at some point down the road WHICH will be a great inside joke to laugh about and that will only help strengthen our already close bond.Oh and since the movie made almost half a million it's a pretty good possibility they are already working on a sequel. It'll be the next Sharknado franchise. So bad it's good.",Rampage

119,trinaboice,"Brainless fun, but pushes the PG-13 line",5,14 April 2018,"Grade: BIn a Nutshell: My 4 sons used to play the 1997 Midway Rampage video game, so I was curious to see how well director Brad Peyton would adapt the game to a movie for the fans. Historically, movies that take video games to the Big Screen are horrible. Well, yeah. This movie requires you to turn off your brain and not care. If you just want to see some monsters destroy a city and watch the ROCK do his thing (he's awesome), then this movie is for you. If storytelling and character development is important to you, then you're going to have trouble watching this. The monsters look great; it's the humans in the movie that feel more like they're in a video game.Tips for parents: 
George , the silverback gorilla, flips the bird several times.
There is a HUGE body count. There are a lot of bloody bodies and some of the deaths are almost portrayed as a joke, which was a bit alarming. Lots of blood splatter.
Lots and lots of destruction and violence
Some profanity
People in perilous situations
Talk of poachers. You'll need to explain to your little ones what poachers are and why they're so bad.
Cleavage
Inappropriate joke at the end.Uplifting theme: 
Family
Friendship
Loyalty
Animal protection
 
Things I liked:
Some humor, although there could have been more since the movie already feels like a cartoon. 
According to IMDB, an original cabinet of the Rampage arcade game can be seen in Claire Wyden's office. That's a fun Easter egg for fans, but it doesn't make sense for her to have it. Midway Arcade Origins - Xbox 360
The movie shows George, the gorilla, living in the San Diego Wildlife Sanctuary. As far as I know, that doesn't really exist, but the San Diego zoo is fantastic. They actually have a really good gorilla habitat there. About 40 minutes outside San Diego is the awesome Wild Animal Park. I used to live in San Diego and can highly recommend both!
I think Malin Akerman's eyes are so pretty. I hated her stiff hair that looked like plastic. Her character, unfortunately, was ridiculous. If you're a Billions: Season One fan, you'll like that she gets to finally play the boss.
Well done CGI. The monsters look really cool.
You see Dwayne Johnson get out of some zip ties. First of all, his biceps are soooo massive! Second, you actually can do it and big biceps aren't required. A former CIA agent taught me how. Make sure the zip lock thing faces up. Then, lift up your arms above your head and quickly pull them down to your hips, pulling your elbows back as fast as you can. Ta da!
SPOILER: Jeffrey Dean Morgan does a bad guy so well. He was so maniacal in The Walking Dead Season 8 that I had to stop watching the show. Seriously evil. Luckily, he has a heart in this movie.
You'll actually learn a little bit of sign language. My niece married a deaf man, so I'm always thrilled when sign language is used in movies. Another movie that uses sign language and is currently in theaters is A Quiet Place. I thought it was really good! You can read my movie review of A QUIET PLACE by clicking here.
I thought it was a respectful nod that the city rampage occurs in Chicago, the headquarters of Midway video games. Things I didn't like:
There were quite a few differences in the movie and game, although George and Ralph keep their names in the movie. Lizzie's name is never mentioned as the crocodile. George was never an albino in the game. The biggest difference is that the monsters in the video game were mutated humans, not mutated animals.
The villains are terrible, but not in a good way. 
Some characters are introduced in the beginning, but completely disappear from the story.
There are some really dumb details that could have been easily fixed if anyone working on the movie had been paying attention or cared.
The young male gorilla that is new at the Sanctuary in the beginning of the movie looks totally fake. George looks much better.
Naomie Harris doesn't really do anything, other than run around and rely on the ROCK to come up with a plan.
The clip in the movie trailer that shows the gorilla crack the crocodile's jaws open like King Kong does to the dinosaur in his movie didn't actually make it into this movie.Funny lines:

Add to that a virtually non-existing plot, insufferable characters and dialogue, and derivative action scenes that make no attempt to go beyond any of the established cliches, and you get the idea what kind film this is. But the film exhibits a further problem: it is stupid. Utterly stupid. Nothing in it makes any sense at all. Characters act in inexplicably dumb ways, and things that make no sense happen over and over again. I felt I was watching a film written by mentally challenged people.

He also went on to say that the Warner Bros. film ""confuses the audience"" and is ""one of those typical feelgood, popcorn bullshit movies that the studios use to brainwash America even more! at well at least this movie has more Critics put more of rating then to uwe boll movies Uwe Boll has got 1% of his movies flopped Uwe Boll Is Idiot Hasn't done any research to found out what's Rampage Based In ??? Rampage was based on game YEARS AGO Rampage is a 1986 arcade game by Bally Midway is based on this movie NOT based On Uwe Boll Film RAMPAGE Game is made way before UWE was a director when his mother was teaching him how to read. the director Brad Peyton who made this movie,  did San Andreas worked with Dwayne ROCK Johnson. But I Thought This Film Is Way Better then San Andreas with Earthquake style witch is bit boring but still good film through it, but this is a lot better story of When three different animals become infected with a dangerous pathogen, a primatologist and a geneticist team up to stop them from destroying Chicago three Animals got giant and bigger like Godzilla witch is amazing idea. Buy the way i can even say CGI is a lot more AND MORE better then These Low Budget Trash can Syfy films mega python vs alligator or mega python vs gatoroid or Mega Shark Versus Crocosaurus trash bin movies. this is a GREAT BIGGER BUDGET Monster Flick with a lot fun and Pace is a lot faster, full on action, full on Animals turned into Monsters cool idea this maybe Dumb Action Flick But it's VERY WATCHABLE Fun Movie Going Time. If you are in to this genre then this movie is for you. one of the worthy monsters movies non named KING KONG or GODZILLA which is much better than you expect. the movie is not only about monsters fight and the stuff u used to watch about those movies but it actually had a pot a character development and even a kind of humor. it's never boring and in the last 30 minutes or so the action is cataclysmic. Dwayne Johnson is great in this movie his character a former US military soldier and member of an anti-poaching unit, is a primatologist in a San Diego wildlife preserve. He befriends a rare albino gorilla named George, whom he saved from poachers. One night, as Davis drives home from work at the San Diego Zoo. i really enjoyed Dwayne Johnson in Doom, Welcome to Jungle AKA Rundown, Walking Tall, The Scorpion King, Gridiron Gang, Faster, also Fast and Furious Franchise, Snitch, G.I. Joe: Retaliation, Pain & Gain, Hercules, San Andreas, Baywatch. he kicks a lot ass and kills monsters in this movie he is really enjoying his character in this movie i can tell and also he has having fun with action witch it has a lot of action in this movie. in this movie i would say this it is a better role for him in this rather then in San Andreas this is type of character i liked to see him another monster flick just like DOOM expect it's not a horror movie, it's action adventure flick, Joe Manganiello (Sabotage, Behind Enemy Lines: Colombia, Justice Ledge he played Slade Wilson / Deathstroke, True Blood) he play's Burke, the leader of a private military group. he wasn't in movie that much sadly because he is only only in it for 10 minutes of movie he does kick ass little but then they wasted him sadly because i expected him to know more about his character a lot more i thought he looked like badass looking guy his character is a lot has to know but i wished he was in all movie teaming up with Dwayne Johnson and Jeffery Dean Morgan and Joe Manganiello i wished but never happened. also another character Dr. Kate Caldwell (Naomie Harris) known for 28 Days Later, Miami Vice, Street Kings, Ninja Assassin, and of crouse she played Eve Moneypenny In Skyfall and Spectre. her character is a discredited genetic engineer who teams up with Okoye, a genetic engineer who explains that this gas was developed by Energyne to rewrite genes on a massive scale. She had hoped to advance CRISPR research as a potential cure for disease. they discovered that Energyne planned to use it as a biological weapon. The company fired her and sent her and Davis to prison for attempting to expose them. then that's when I Loved Jeffery Dean Morgan Harvey Russell, a government agent who works for an agency called OGA. who looked like a villain but later on Davis gives Chance To help Harvey Russell. now i love Jeffery Dean Morgan i loved Losers, i liked The Courier, Heist AKA Bus 657, also Negan Walking Dead. he plays great character not another Negan Villain type. he was in all movie he did a great job, Animals turned into big was a the mutated wolf, the mutated crocodile, Gorilla George who is good side. it kinda feels Opposite to Godzilla Battling with Ronin but it's like King Kong VS Mutated Crocodile the movie. then all movie is so fun it maybe dumb it could look silly it's strange but give this movie a BIG SHOT believe me it's nothing bad compare then comparing any another SC-FI bullcrap channel this is a lot better believe me this movie you don't wanna miss out it's a lot fun, it's intense if you love Movie Monster Flicks battling each another feels opposite to Godzilla this is right movie for you then ! believe me listening and reading people another opinions of what they say about this movie and how bad it is DON'T EVER READ THAT OR LISTEN TO THEM it's your choice of you want to see it BUT HEY if Critics or it's nothing special or it's rubbish or it's nothing special HEY nowadays Critics are WRONG because sometimes when movie got what bad it's not bad movie like The Room or Alone in the dark or any another very bad lower rating like 1.0 and 1% in Rotten Tomatoes ?? this got 50% Rotten Tomatoes and 6.4 in IMDb it's not bad thing for you not to see this movie at all, it's really worth to pay this movie for ticket to cinema or buying it on DVD or Blu ray or 4K what ever you get it's worth it because this is a lot fun a lot of action and if your die hard fan of Dwayne Johnson this is IT THEN !!! go and see it, it's worth it.....",Rampage

137,stevenrotherforth,A film that is crazier than poo from a bat!,5,30 January 2019,"RampageBased on a video game of the same name which I've never played.
Rampage is a movie that is crazier than poo from a bat.
Basically a film about some substance from space that causes an ape, wolf and crocodile to get really big and go on a rampage.
Yep you read that right.
If you watched 'The Meg' and thought that was ridiculous then I definitely know this movie is going to give you an aneurism!
Unlike 'The Meg' this movie starring Dwayne Johnson is devoid of any charisma.
Sounds ridiculous doesn't it? Johnson oozes the stuff but not even he can save this film.
The special effects are top notch but as a whole package 'Rampage' fails to engage its audience.
It's a crashy smashy bombastic movie but no amount of carnage can replace what's missing.
I just didn't care about any of the characters. Only the CGI ape was likeable.
I don't mind a silly movie.
I thought 'The Meg' was fantastic.
Rampage however can't back up its silliness with anything memorable.
None of the action set pieces wow you.
Strange as we have three mutated beasts knocking the stuffing out of each other and buildings fall, still it's just a meh of a movie.
Sure it does look wonderful in UHD and the special effects for the most part stand up even at this high resolution.
HDR allow colours to pop but theirs nothing eye watering here.
Sound is equally good.
Your subwoofer will boom and your speakers will be stretched to an inch of their lives.
As with most big budget blockbusters of today this is yet another movie that's all style over substance.
An instantly forgettable movie.",Rampage
138,joelwatchesmovies,Decent when it doesn't take itself too seriously (which happens too often),6,14 August 2018,"Given its wild concept and expectedly undercooked plot and characters (the opening supporting cast and the villains' motives end up MIA), the film's at its best when it aims for camp (see Davis in the helicopter: ""It's coming back to me"") and at its worst when it takes itself too seriously (sorry, you did *not* earn the slow motion and mournful strings post-climax). Good destructo-action, mediocre everything else (even poor sometimes-what was with that awful parachute selfie camera angle?)",Rampage
139,LloydBayer,Big gets bigger as dumb gets dumber in a monster movie with bark but no bite.,4,11 April 2018,"Based on the 1986 button mashing video game of the same name, Rampage has Dwayne Johnson playing a role similar to those seen in some of his previous films - the lone hero who must save the world. That's not such a bad thing as there are several other action movie icons tasked with similar roles. But Johnson also makes two types of films in conventional roles - the action film meant to be funny, and the action film meant to be serious. Rampage tries to be both but succeeds at neither. The film is instead in the same boat as Johnson's 2015 CGI potpourri of disaster, devastation, and destruction - San Andreas. While that film revelled in the complete destruction of California, this film does the same with the city of Chicago but in a tired old way - adding size to spectacle. That's what happens to George, a blue eyed albino gorilla under the care of a primatologist played by Johnson. Thanks to a mysterious virus from a doomed space station that crashes into Chicago, George is in a furious fit and there's no way of containing his rage nor his increasing body mass. While it would have been tried and tested to go the King Kong route, the film tries to remain loosely based on the video game it is named after by introducing two more ferocious creatures that have mutated along with George. Two would have been fine, but three's a crowd and Chicago serves as the proverbial China Shop. With the inclusion of some violence and creature terror, Rampage is only watchable for its action segments and a few scenes of standard quality visual effects. The story and sci-fi mumbo jumbo about the mutation are not just dull, it's an early warning indication that goes from lame to lazy and stays that way. Even so, nothing can be worse than the excruciating fact that Rampage tries to be a very serious film in everything it tries to be. What little humour the film has also feels juvenile, even if it means imagining an ape making lurid gestures on a big screen. If that's the highlight of this film, you can just imagine how unintelligent the rest can get. And that's before the film abandons any sense of common sense. Sorry George. Kong is still King!",Rampage
140,DLochner,Unexpected entertaining,7,3 April 2020,"Beautifully entertaining, like so many films with Dwayne Johnson. The film follows a classic Hollywood storyline. Mixed with a crazy portion of science fiction and oversized monsters. Everything told so simply that you don't have to think much. Nothing stands in the way of an entertaining movie night.",Rampage
141,p-jonsson,"Don't think, just enjoy the huge monster rampage.",8,7 October 2018,"This movie is following the usual recipe for these kind of movies. Big companies are bad, gene science is bad, big monsters are cool. The story is fairly ludicrous, science non-existent and almost everyone except the hero is a dumb-ass.Regardless of all that, I quite enjoyed this movie. I watched it with the expectation of seeing The Rock and huge monsters wreck things and that is exactly what I got. The story itself is weak and the science is, well ludicrous. How these monsters grows to immense sizes in almost no time at all defies science of course. But heck, who want's to spend time in a action movie watching animals grow? Also, what a strange coincidence that the ape, who happens to be on the good side, is the only one of them that doesn't grow huge fangs, horns or other horrific appendages. As I said, the story is nonsense.However, once the action starts it is the usual wreck everything overkill kind of action that which is one of the few things that Hollywood is really good at these times. I really enjoyed it even if it was, at times, very very silly. And then we have The Rock. I really like The Rock. Call me old-fashioned but I do like macho type heroes with silly one-liners.As usual the military trying to fight the monsters are depicted, pretty much, as morons. Uberconfident in their capacity to stop the monsters. The monsters of course proves them wrong. So what to do then? Well just nuke them. Okay, they didn't try to use actual nukes but dropping a MOAB on the downtown of a major city is not that far from using nukes. I mean, come on, they claimed to have evacuated the city in what? A few hours. Not happening. Also in the fighting before this dumb-ass decision they send in a Warthog which was a fairly logical decision at least but they send in a single one! What the f...? And do not get me started about these creatures just shrugging of a Warthog. These planes are tank-killers for Christ sake. Oh well, here I go about science again.Bad guys. Gotta have bad guys (well apart from the monsters of course) don't we? Well, Claire Wyden is not too bad. The stereotypical big company asshole not caring about anything than her personal gains. However, Brett Wyden is just annoying. He's stupid, stupid, stupid and just overly childish. Did I say stupid? From the first scene that he was in I rooted for him to get eaten by his sister's creations. He wasn't eaten actually but his demise was fairly satisfactory nonetheless.Despite all of this I did, as I wrote earlier, enjoy the movie. It was exactly what I hoped it would be. A roller-coaster ride of action and mayhem. The Rock was great. His ""side-kick"" Dr. Caldwell was okay but fairly forgettable. Agent Russell however went from annoying government agent to one of my favorite characters in the course of the movie. The scene where he stops that dumb-ass Brett Wayden and then lets him walk away towards his well deserved destiny quite enjoyable.I did like the ape as well. I liked how he made jokes on The Rock. An ape giving The Rock the finger may sound silly but it was actually quite funny.Bottom line, two hours of good entertainment providing that monsters on rampage is your kind of movie.",Rampage

I saw the original King Kong in a classic century-old theatre--the kind with the stage and red velvet curtains--when I was a kid, and it's always stuck with me.

143,Magow-Intermean,Rampage Review,9,25 March 2019,"A shady technology company develops a process that turns innocent animals into giant killer monsters. Unfortunately, their serum infects the wrong animals, including the gorilla pal of zoologist Davis Okoye (Dwayne Johnson), putting the entire world at risk.
In Hollywood, if you have a really dumb idea for a movie and a lot of money to make it, you call The Rock. That's not intended as an insult; the guy is just the industry's greatest salesman. Two hundred and 60 pounds of oiled muscles and oil-free charisma, he can sell you things you thought you actively did not want: a Jumanji reboot, sequels to G.I. Joe and Journey To The Centre Of The Earth, films featuring Kevin Hart, Baywat... Okay, everyone has their limits. Rampage is a quintessential Johnson project. Based on a video game with no story or characters to speak of, from a time before many of his fans were born, it sounds like a dreadful basis for a movie. And it sort of is, but it's also sort of a lot of fun.
This very silly movie could actually have afforded to be a lot sillier.
The original Rampage came out in 1986, when games were simple (you moved from side to side either punching things or shooting them or gorging on white dots and ghosts) and repetitive. And we were glad of it. In Rampage, players controlled one of three giant monsters - a wolf, a lizard, or a gorilla - and tried to destroy cities before the military could shoot them down and turn them back into the humans they apparently once were. Sacrilegiously messing with the canon, the Rampage movie does not feature humans becoming monsters. Instead, while trying to find a cure for cancer by ""gene editing"", scientists have (not-so) accidentally created a serum that turns normal animals into angry, enormous monsters. To avoid the prying eyes of the government and others who might notice titanic hamsters devouring Downtown, these scientists have been carrying out their experiments in space. But things go awry, the space station blows up, and several canisters of monster juice are sent hurtling to Earth. Two land in the wilderness and another crashes into a San Diego zoo, where Davis Okoye (Johnson) works with gorillas. His favourite, an albino called George, is affected by the serum and grows colossal and violent.
To pick apart the plot would be a waste of time, because it's purely functional. There's no subtlety or art to it, nor should there be. This is a movie about gorillas punching buildings. You don't want character work getting in the way of that. It's fine when the villains (brother and sister megalomaniacs Malin Åkerman and Jake Lacy) say they need to turn their office building's radio aerial into a giant-monster-homing beacon so had their tech guys ""modify it last night"". Because who cares how they did it? Equally, who's concerned that Naomie Harris' miscellaneously science-y character hacks a multi-billion dollar tech company using a thermostat she found in the fridge, because it's ""all connected to the same grid""? Logic is only going to slow things down. Those buildings won't punch themselves.
When it comes to the building-punching portion of the show, there could have been more of it. This very silly movie could actually have afforded to be a lot sillier. Brad Peyton, director of that other loony Rock joint San Andreas, doesn't keep his tongue always fully in his cheek and he sometimes seems to be shooting, misguidedly, for cool. Johnson is mostly playing his gags with an eyebrow waggle, but not all of the film has his broad confidence. Those villains could be camper, the action sequences could use some more visual gags to enjoy the absurdity of the conceit, and is it greedy to wish the massive gorilla, wolf and lizard were even bigger? Warner Bros. may already have Godzilla and King Kong up its very roomy sleeve, and was perhaps concerned about stepping on those extremely big toes, but when it comes to city-toppling beasts, there's always room for more. Rampage is big dumb fun, but not as big, dumb and fun as it could have been.
Ridiculous, of course, but not as ridiculous as it might have been. As much fun as it has with the idea of animals stomping cities to rubble, it seems shy of going completely over the top, and it's the poorer for it.",Rampage
144,Mike_Devine,"If fiction were actually science, we'd all be in trouble",5,2 December 2018,"Dwayne Johnson has really made a name for himself anchoring mid-budget to big-budget action films of late, and WB's translation of another video game franchise in 'Rampage' is the latest example of the actor striking gold at the box office, critics be damned.In 'Rampage,' Johnson plays animal caretaker Davis Okoye, a former Army officer who has dedicated his life to protecting animals including an albino gorilla named George. Why, of course, who wouldn't want to become best friends with one of the most dangerous, unpredictable animals on Earth? But things go south real fast when George and two other unsuspecting wild animals come into contact with samples from a science experiment gone wrong, as gene editing via CRISPR creates some pretty nasty beasts that do what else but wreak havoc on civilians. Again - your standard Johnson film circa 2010s.Despite the over-the-top plot, nonstop special effects, constant screeching of steel and machine gunfire and bad dialogue between Johnson and his gorilla friend, there are some not so bad elements in 'Rampage.' For one, Naomie Harris does a respectable job as an ex-pharma employee genetic engineer who is driven to resolve the incident, while Jeffrey Dean Morgan does his best ""non-Negan Negan"" impression of a secretive government official who is one part cowboy, one part patriot. And it had been a while since Chicago was destroyed in a movie, so at least it's done right here.But overall, there's not much that keeps 'Rampage' from being your standard B-movie fare.",Rampage
145,scottshak_111,Silly Monster Entertainer,6,3 September 2018,"Totally surprised by Rampage movie! Now I don't generally walk in with high hopes for a video game movie. They have a really bad track record except for Tomb Raider which I thought was pretty good when you hang them up to dry. What was making matters already worse for Rampage was its trailer, which had already shown all the daft stuff that we were to see and expect from the flick. Turns out the movie is actually entertaining.Brad Peyton has a history of making pointless movies. So a movie wherein genetically engineered giants are overtaking a city seemed not only far-fetched but utterly imaginative. But that was a game after all. Even though the fancy feels undoubtedly juvenile, the good thing is that the movie adaptation of the Rampage game leverages it to the maximum.Hits and Misses
Rampage movie becomes laughable at times, the CGI in particular, where you can literally differentiate the background from the forefront. There are plenty of instances lurking in the latter half of the movie that insinuate the obvious.But luckily that isn't the case for the most part of it. There are areas where it scores high owing to its CGI alone. All of it fills the movie with content giving it a proper weight in terms of substance.Rampage movie houses plenty of action primarily in areas where the trinities wreak havoc. All of it is bound to take you back to your childhood days. If you are not meticulously bothered about minutiae that makes up a movie, you wouldn't realize its numerous flaws. Just do not think much and you are going to end up having a good time.Plot and Theme of Rampage Movie (Spoilers)
Peyton walks in with an impossible plot and yet he turns it into something tangible. Few minutes in the movie, and you are thinking - I will bite it. Because things are made pretty believable. From a zero-gravity shot in the beginning to the part where the three, nay two animals, are shown encountering humans for the first time are just ravishingly built.Gene manipulation canisters fall on earth at three different locations, as a result of an experiment gone wrong. They are either consumed or encountered by three different animals - a wolf, a crocodile and a gorilla. Out of these animals, the gorilla is friendly. Name's George who is under the care of Davis Okoye (Dwayne Johnson), a primatologist in a wildlife preserve.With rapid genetic changes, these animals begin to grow showing immense strength. Davis is approached by Dr. Kate Caldwell (Naomie Harris) who explains him the concept behind genetic editing.The Summon
To make matters worse we have brother-sister duo antagonists who use a transmitter in the center of Chicago to lure the animals in order to cover up their screw-up by distorting all evidence and pointing them towards Kate. So the trio, the monsters, rampage towards the center of the city destroying everything in their wild run as the US Army tries to stop them.But they are unstoppable. They destroy the transmitter as Davis becomes successful in bringing George to the good side of the wall.Then George and Davis become tight again, and they attack the Wolf (Ralph) and the Crocodile (Lizzie). Even though the Wolf and the Crocodile are already fighting. But the Croc makes the job easy (Watch out for that badass bit where the croc literally rips the wolf apart!)George and Davis together manage to slay the reptilian as George ends up going down. Surprise! Eventually, we find him intact as well as he plays pretend dead to mock Davis.Read more at Straight From a Movie website.",Rampage
146,DeBBss,Pretty Average...,5,10 August 2018,"Dwayne Johnson is doing pretty good for himself in 2018; releasing two movies so far. Both 2018 movies feel tacked on and rushed, and Rampage suffers from both those issues. Dwyane Johnson has realized that he's one of the biggest actors nowadays, so he has to star in as much movies as he can before his hype dies down. The name Rampage is very self explanatory for the movie, and most of the time the movie does a great job at living up to the name. Dwayne Johnson is already in four movies in 2019, and I'm very confident he's going to burn himself out. Whenever I see a movie that's all about enjoying the action and having a great, I usually join the audiences' opinion, but this time I'm joining the critics.Story: 6/10Rampage is a very average monster movie, and it keeps that classic aspect to it. Rampage doesn't offer anything new, except for bringing in giant animals that could destroy a city. I think the script is a little silly in my opinion; that scientists were experimenting antidotes in space, then it goes south and the remaining antidotes fall onto Earth and a couple animals touched it and became big and dangerous. The story is very focused on corporate aspects, which a lot of movies nowadays focus on. To be honest, I was expecting a worse storyline, but it wasn't that bad. The pacing was pretty good, and the movie stays on track and doesn't focus on subplots too much. Overall, the story was decent, the pacing was pretty good for an action movie, and the story has a classic monster movie aspect to it.Characters: 3/10A lot of action movies have trouble with creating good characters, and Rampage suffers from that too. All the characters were cliche; each character had their own stereotype. Dwayne was the strong protagonist, Dr. Kate Caldwell (Played by: Naomie Harris) was the smart good scientist, Claire Wyden (Played by: Malin Akerman) was the evil corporate leader, and Harvey Russell (Played by: Jeffrey Dean Morgan) was the cowboy special ops commander. The rest of the supporting characters were also cliches too. The monsters were done well; looking scary and being able to cause a lot of destruction. What confused me the most about the monsters was, why didn't George become all mean looking like the wolf and the crocodile. Overall, the characters were stereotypical and just terrible, the monsters were good, but why didn't George become evil looking?Action: 8/10Being a PG-13 movie, Rampage was very gore. There was a curtain scene that looked like it was ripped straight out of Saving Private Ryan (D-Day scene). I think the reason why this movie was PG-13 is because Dwayne Johnson was in it, but this movie easily could've been rated R. The comedy was very weak, not one joke landed, and it just came out awkward. I liked how when the action started, it never stopped; it was just constant action. Overall, Rampage is very brutal, and it could've been a rated R film, the action was fun and it never stopped, but the comedy was very weak and disappointing.Overall, Rampage is an average movie. I only enjoyed the action, and that's it. A lot of action movies have great action, but a weak script, and Rampage is the perfect example of that. The comedy was really awkward and painfully cringey. The characters were terrible; all being cliches and stereotypes of modern Hollywood. Rampage is a fun movie to watch; only watch Rampage for the action, and that's it.",Rampage

Second fIlm of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - Rampage. When man interferes with nature, it always goes wrong, you think people would learn but why do they have to when Dwayne Johnson is there to save the day!!! Inspired by a video game I'm not familiar with, Rampage is as corny as they come, yet with monsters as gargantuan to the species as Dwayne Johnson is to his, this film somehow works. A science experiment, in the eyes of many, has gone wrong, but in the greedy money grabbing eyes of the people who are in control of the scientists, everything is right on track to make their fortune. Throw the military into the mix and you have a typical Hollywood all action disaster film. Once again Chicago bears the brunt, and it's such visual feast of varying shaped buildings, interspersed with bridges, waterways, a raised railway transit system and a huge lake next to it, it must be a movie makers delight to base it as the battlefield of all manner of horror/disaster/saving humanity stories, and I for one love seeing it used as a set for such film genres. This film will not win any best actor awards, but the special effects guys should get a look in. Moments of humour intersect all the dramatic action and it makes for a very enjoyable film.",Rampage

It's big, dumb, loud fun, on par with the Rock's typical schtick. If you enjoyed his other action films, you'll probably enjoy this one. It's ""King Kong"", ""Jurassic World"", ""Planet of the Apes"" and ""Godzilla"" all in one. It's a great way to kill 90 minutes and turn off your brain on a lazy weekend. It's like a live action Saturday morning cartoon. There were actually quite a few funny lines in the movie as well, along with some dark humor that you might feel bad for laughing at, but can't really help it. The Rock was by far the best part of this movie. He knows what kind of movie this is and acknowledges how dumb (in a good way) it is.

If you want to see huge monsters bash it out in a city and cause a lot of havoc in the process then this movie is for you. If you are expecting something as good as the original Pacific Rim then you might be a bit disappointed (although its along the same feel for a movie, I thought Pacific Rim did it better).",Rampage

It is a fun ride. The bad guy from ""Walking Dead"" shows up and does a good job. The special effects are good although the plot is unbelievable.

153,kaptenvideo-89875,"Just like any other epic rumble with Dwayne Johnson, just add another giant ape. And Wolf. And crocodile.",5,17 April 2018,"Here comes another generic yet watchable ""major movie event"" that you don't really need to see but kind of want to - because the blockbusters' world's favorite rent-a-hero Dwayne Johnson aka The Rock is starring in it.Genetically modified giant ape, wolf and crododile arrive to beat up a city and it's up to the world's awesome-looking primatologist (Johnson) to find a solution - which also involves dealing with evil corporation responsible for creating the monsters in the first place. ""American Godzilla"" would be a proper title, really.Also starring, Naomie Harris, Malin Akerman, Jake Lacy, and constantly scene-stealing Jeffrey Dean Morgan who's the only member of human cast able to lend the movie a bit of charm and playfulness it desperately needs more of.You see, for an screen entertainment based on old video game, ""Rampage"" takes itself a bit too seriously. I believe it'd benefit from ditching any machoness entirely and go straight for the maximum fun factor.Johnson as a leading man is nice as always but he gives the project little more than his usual buffed-up body and winning personality. He seems to be more or less just walking through the role, and we just know that he could do this sort of thing in his sleep.Kinda makes you wonder why the big guy's never up for finding some actually intriguing projects for a change. Nothing wrong with the umpteenth sequel to ""Fast and Furious"" or ""Jumanji"" or what have you, but surely he's earned enough money to be secretly yearning for more than utterly generic action epics by now?Say what you want, at least the destroying the city parts feel visually true to the original video game released in 1986 (you can watch the sessions in YouTube). Only amped up to the 11, of course.Big powerful creatures annihilating cars, houses and other stuff never really gets old now, does it? Watching it feels like being a child again, feeling omnipotent. So, let's call it a successful game to movie adaptation if only sporadically exciting movie on its own.To sum it up, ""Rampage"" is a'ight, if you can't get enough of Johnson, or screen epics with a strong me-too vibe. Others need not apply. There's nothing you haven't seen before, in countless superhero or catastrophe or big monster movies. I guess it does what it's supposed to - mildly entertain you for 100-some minutes - but nothing more.The already mediocre screenplay is let down further by occasionally overly hammy acting (Jake Lacy is not really meant for this kind of role) and plot turns that seems to scream: we did not even care about it all, just typed that shit in our MacBooks and sent it to the producers.As a sidenote: I don't like seeing (big) animals getting hurt because of the greediness and sheer brutality of humans. Seriously, ours supposed to be the enlightened age, why is there a steady flow of Hollywood epics about people being mean to animals recently, such as ""King Kong"" and ""Planet of the Apes"" series?",Rampage
154,jb_campo,Not much of a plot. Paper-thin characters. Heavy CGI.,5,18 January 2019,"Rampage is a B- grade movie because there really isn't much of a plot. It starts out pretty well with a mysterious incident in space, but once the action starts on earth, the storyline becomes paper thin.Of course there are bad guys with guns trying to capture genetically modified creatures. Of course there is a creepy executive team that is trying to make gazillions of money. Oh, will they survive? Sigh, everyone knows the plot, we've seen it hundreds of time.The Rock did as well as he could, trying to hold up the movie on his broad shoulders, but he really had nothing to hold up. Naomie Harris plays his sidekick heroine, but her character was also thin and lifeless. The star real person was Jeffrey Dean Morgan as this pistol-toting mystery man from some mysterious govt agency that allows him to intervene everywhere. He had fun with this character, going over the top with a Texan drawl and cliche after cliche.The bulk of the movie relied heavily on CGI work, which was top notch. The director tried to create a bond between the Rock, who bonded with this gorilla George when George was little. They could even sign to each other and make jokes, but, IDK, it just doesn't seem to really work enough.There is a ton of fighting animals and planes, rockets, guns, etc. You've seen this all before too. In the end, the lack of character depth and plot cannot be overcome by solid acting from the Rock and JD Morgan. A Hollywood ending wraps it all up in a nice tidy bow, but left me hoping that they don't dare try to create a sequel to this rather flat, unsatisfying movie.Rampage is not terrible, but it's not very good either. It's a slightly below average film, and you certainly could do worse than watching Rampage.",Rampage

Silly things happen and you have to suspend your brain for a bit. He gets shot ... still runs and jumps and climbs and fights because ... you know ... he is the Rock. The science is laughable. But -- you don't go see a movie with a wrestler as the star for realism. It is a well made movie with great plot lines and well developed characters. The Rock shines in this type of action film and even the bad guy from Walking Dead does a good job here. We enjoyed the ride. Lots of CGI of course, I started to think about how hard it is to work on this type of movie, a year of standing in front of a green screen and acting like you are scared of a wolf that isn't there. Anyway, a fun ride, I'd recommend it.",Rampage

 one of the worthy monsters movies non named KING KONG or GODZILLA which is much better than u expect.
 the movie is not only about monsters fight and the stuff u used to watch about those movies but it actually had a pot a character development and even a kind of humor.
 it's never boring and in the last 30 minutes or so the action is cataclysmic.
 needless to say about the gorgeous special effects.
 I am a fanatic monsters movie fan.....I own all Godzilla and king kong related films but few films of this genre are worthy and don't include those two most famous monsters in their story.
 one of those films now is.....RAMPAGE. It's not perfect but it's good enough to buy the dvd when it will be out and of course first to watch it in a theater with a lot of pop corn and coke. Finally a worthy monsters movie GRADE // B-

The CGI that this movie manages to deliever throughout the whole one and a half hour is outstanding, in the end, the whole point of the movie is the RAMPAGE that the monsters make in the city, since it is based on the Rampage Video Game (for those who do not know). I was waiting for the water monster like ""We've seen the gorilla and the wolf, isn't there going to be the water monster also ? And boom, there it is, coming out from the water in the best way and in the best moment possible. The last 20 minutes of the movie were phenomenal, putting a cherry on top of this glorious masterpiece. The main light was meant to be put on George and not on The Rock, so if you see the movie from that point of view, you will understand and realise it's greatness, altho The Rock (who I don't like so much as an actor) did pretty good, aside from the cringe stupid jokes that he was making with George, which are the director's fault. 8/10 for me.",Rampage

True to its title, the film has no shortage of destruction with 3 Giants monsters.

164,asifahsankhan,"Hell, compared to most video-game adaptations, it's actually bloody good!",6,24 April 2018,"This is a big, dumb monster movie far more cartoonish than most modern comic book movies, and more like silly, classic monster movies than the modern takes on King Kong and Godzilla. The evil corporation responsible for the mayhem is comically, ridiculously evil; the dialogue is campy in a '90s sort of a way and the narrative doesn't much bother with logic or reason.If that's what you're after and you keep your quality expectations low, Rampage is just fine.The arcade game it's based on was beloved for massive monsters smashing down a city's buildings, while a tiny human army pitifully tried to stop them. The film certainly delivers that - although it takes about an hour for the monsters to make it to the city. The climactic battle has some suitably epic moments that deliver on a pure spectacle level.But the obvious requirement for all of the important bits to be made in a computer lessens the impact, as it pretty much always does. The CGI is really well done, but in several of the crucial action shots it clearly looks like CGI, failing to properly trick the human eye into believing.Dwayne Johnson's enormous charisma makes every scene he's in enjoyable, Naomie Harris makes for an interesting sidekick and Joe Manganiello is a surprising highlight as a sexy mercenary. Jeffrey Dean Morgan goes a little too far with it all, making his Walking Dead character seem subtle by comparison, but most of the supporting cast here ham things up more than they should.That's all part of the stupendous, winking tone - which will probably piss a lot of viewers off, even though I quite enjoyed it. There are some lame jokes that shouldn't have been left in there and it's a shame about how some of the action doesn't work, but the movie is just fine.

The Army wants to drop a bomb on Chicago. Oh, oh.The acting is good all around and we hear some good lines from time to time. At one point Kate (Naomie Harris) tells Davis that there are other ways instead of fighting to get your point across and Davis replies that isn't as much fun.

This is truly a CGI-Fest. Be prepared for a lot of destruction especially in Chicago.

167,FelipeCarrillo,All gods must fall down,4,10 May 2018,"To this day, over half of all humans in the world must know who Dwayne Douglas Johnson is. Born in Hayward (California), this man earned a reputation, mostly on Yankee territory, for his career as a bodybuilder and professional wrestler, however, when Hollywood officially opened his onerous doors to him, he began his rapid claim to viscose fame. At the beginning of the 21st century, he got his first acting role, which was merely a kind of cameo in Stephen Sommers' ""The Mummy Returns."" However, at the expense of his unstoppable popularity and the good reception of his character, he got his own movie, an indelible and sultry audiovisual piece of doubtful dimensions of realism, Chuck Russell's ""The Scorpion King"" will never be forgotten thanks to those unrealistic raids on CGI technology. From then on, only successes have rained down on the burly shoulders of the American actor, movies announcing with trumpets the emergence of a superstar, breakout hits guaranteed. He has trod on- or simulated - to steal the show in front of a huge audience: wild jungles in ""The Rundown"", haunted peaks in ""Race to Witch Mountain"" or speed-thirsty roads in ""Furious 7"". Absolutely no commercial role was out of this man's league, who continues to win the most coveted characters in the field more quickly; they are really a few unrealized facets that the actor, 45, needs to explore, since he has had the possibility of playing from the tooth fairy to a football player, from an avatar in a retro-modern video game to a DC villain very soon, from a savvy lifesaver to a firefighter and air rescue pilot. And as if this were not enough, you have to add his habitual participation as an actor on the small screen with HBO (""Ballers"") and his personal videos uploaded on YouTube. Either by his innate sex appeal, his voluminous muscles, his perfect smile, his talent as an interpreter or his inherent charisma, ""The Rock"" - as most people know him - has monopolized the attention of millions of spectators, who, in fact, are the ones who allow him to be one of the most valuable and highest-paid movie stars of the decade in the mecca of cinema. It's one thing to love him, but another associate the box office success of his films with their quality or, even, with the quality of their performances, which personally have ended up being undoubtedly charismatic but terribly monotonous and almost identical, sometimes I even think I'm seeing the same dude from the movie from two months ago, and actually, that's what I felt with his last work, the straw that breaks the camel's back.""Rampage"" is the typical American blockbuster. And not necessarily one of the good ones. Titanic beasts, pompous action sequences, openly fanciful storylines, characters pigeonholed into lifelong stereotypes and one disaster, one apocalyptic disaster that incoherently assures the conception of a new franchise. We're so bushed of this situation that we're bursting with joy when an original idea doesn't become a shameless exploitation.Warner Bros is doing its best to break the spell on film adaptations of video games- only this year, it has released three films inspired or based on different electronic game sagas, - the sad news is that none of them has actually nullified the curse. ""Ready Player One"" is out of the game because, although it shows hundreds of references, it does so in an easter-eggs mix and not as a story itself, in fact, it's an adaptation of Ernest Cline's bestselling, as Steven Spielberg's kinematic adrenaline must be excepted from this fearsome category. Now, although many agree that Brad Peyton's newest movie chaos has been the best of video game adaptations due to critics consensus - on Rotten Tomatoes, it got a minimally good score to tell the truth, - actually, it's fairly incorrect and unfair to ensure that, based on the film itself, it's noticed that the 1986 arcade game launched by Midway Games doesn't conform even 20% of the DNA of Peyton's film, is a story frankly distant; It's better to say that it's a source of inspiration, but drastically not an adaptation.Toying with animalistic hybrids growing disproportionately and destroying almost all the City of Chicago, especially to Hollywood, looks suggestive, looks juicy, smells like money, an authentic CGI milking, and ultimately, that's what it becomes. There is not a story that really thrills the spectator, there are no attractable or special characters leading this unfortunate journey, there are no powerful twists and credible plot decisions for the film, in fact, there is not even a good execution of the action sequences, which, to be honest, have been one of the most frighteningly insipid, synthetic and soporific in a big-budget adventure movie, putting different kind of beasts in an urban quadrangle to fight each other is no longer as fun as before, just ask ""Pacific Rim: Uprising.""The references and ""homages"" are obvious and offensive. The fight sequences between these gigantic animals bring back memories of the great classics of Japanese monster cinema, especially Kaiju and Daikaiju. Many of the set-pieces in which these creatures dispute without contention brought to my memory immediately the hyperstylized and bombastic ""King Kong: Skull Island"" by Jordan Vogt-Roberts, the dramatic and slow-burning ""Godzilla"" by Gareth Edwards and, of course, Ishiro Honda's Japanese masterpieces. Likewise, a certain sequence - not well executed - reminded me the beleaguered and repudiated ""the Mummy"" by Alex Kurtzman, a film in which the only set-piece vividly intriguing and excellently edited was that of the plane, the free fall. The disappointing thing is that it never fulfills its purpose, a disrespectful honor, they simply use them to bestow a personality, that is already nonexistent, to a film that is as clumsy as long.There is something special to highlight Andrew Lockington's soundtrack. In different parts of the film, mostly in the first and second act, the compositions imposed on certain scenes were paradoxically appealing, I had never heard such unusual melodies in an action film, the effect I had on the scenes was minimal but moderately unusual and new. Jaron Presant's cinematography looks good, not spectacular, new-generation video-game zooms are well-used, four is the perfect number, but there are no risky or innovative ideas, a factor that should be key in this genre in which the script is terrible, the pictures must shine, Hollywood must attract people into theaters, at least, for their exaggerated production and art designs, but actually, if Warner's box office results for this movie are fabulous the only justifiable cause is The Rock, as its mediocre CGI and its futile premise end up being, rather a good focus of attention, a red alert for our money. As for Bob Ducsay' and Jim May's edition, there are not many good things can be said, as the film is tortuously long to be a pre-summer blockbuster, almost two hours of obscene visual gags coming from an albino monkey and frankly ineffective sequences that prey on the spectator's interest and end up overwhelming the experience, a cutting tactic, an endless nightmare that made me yawned fifteen times, but relax, long runtimes are only acceptable with films as ""Blade Runner 2049.""""Rampage"" by Brad Peyton is not a lousy feature film, but is not a moderately enjoyable one either, has a fantastic cast - which is unfortunately thrown into the trash - but poorly structured, all-dimensional characters. The action sequences, the main offer of the studio for audiences, are odd-looking - not in the good sense of the word, - its edition does not give any impact to the cinematic experience it supposedly offers. The film won't harm the unstoppable career of The Rock, however, compared to the average of his films and the previous and much more exciting disaster movie with the same filmmaker (""San Andreas"") is sadly inferior. A useless toy, grandiloquent and empty entertainment that will earn millions of dollars, but that will be forgotten as fast as the destruction of Chicago; excessively long, monotonous and clumsy; Warner Bros' last bet in the universe of video game adaptations slips back to the last position of the list.",Rampage
168,Olicosmic,Brainless filler that has a few moments,4,29 May 2019,"Before going into this movie, I had no idea this was based off of an old arcade game, so keep that in mind as I review this film, as I'm looking at it in a lens where my expectations weren't altered in a way. I was expecting a good movie with a solid performance from Dwayne Johnson. Even with ignorance on my side, I still didn't like this movie. I didn't hate it, but this is one of the biggest hodgepodges I've ever seen, and that's not a good thing. This film's whole story is one of the most underdeveloped I've seen in a film in recent years. It goes on about how this one Lady invented a way to regenerate and edit genes in animals, but the way this film does it is extremely sloppy. There are plot holes, incohesions, and just underdevelopments everywhere, almost to the point that the story is never more than just plain stupid. The pacing is wonky, too. This movie can go from fast to slow in a drop of a hat, and the scenes in which these happen rarely work. I was bored in a few scenes where I feel like I shouldn't have been. This whole movie is just a sloppy mess that has little of value, but at the same time, it's not entirely doom and gloom (for whatever that's worth). I thought the performances, for the most part, were good, as I liked most of the characters (with the exception of the basic business villains. Those characters sucked). The action scenes where George fight the other monsters were definitely thrilling, which makes it hurt that much more that this happened in the near end of the film. Everything else about this movie just failed to be that interesting to me. It's just mindless garbage that may be fun to watch once, but never really again. I don't really recommend this film to anyone, because for the good things this film brings, this film has 2-3 times more bad stuff to boot. I understand that some people like this film, so maybe, you may like it. But don't count on it, because despite this film having a few moments, it's nothing more than brainless filler.",Rampage

However, I didn't get the amount of monster I wanted too. Only the last 20 minutes of the movie are really the monsters fighting each other, the rest of the movie is just a bunch of useless military conversations, Malin Akerman being evil (and gorgeous), and Dwayne Johnson being bulletproof.

171,kevinxirau,A monster of a good time!,8,21 April 2018,"The giant monster craze lives on with ""Rampage"", this one being based on a video game series dating back to 1986. With a few exceptions, video game movies tend to fail with audiences and fans, either because they stray too far from the source material or that, despite getting the visuals and worlds right, the narrative structure + direction aren't cohesive. Rampage is unique in that it never had much in the way of story with the monsters' origins changing with each version, allowing for creative freedom. Thus, we have this film starring Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson playing a primatologist whose friend, albino gorilla George, is mutated by a strange chemical, not only growing bigger and stronger, but also more aggressive. Making matters worse, a wolf (Ralph) and a crocodile (Lizzie) are also exposed, which leads to all three, as the title implies, going on a rampage.So, does ""Rampage"" manage to break free from the video game movie curse? In short, yes! I had lots of fun with this movie. It keeps the spirit of the games while telling its own story. What surprised me was how invested I was in the characters. The Rock gives a solid charismatic performance as expected as does Naomie Harris, both of whom work nicely as a pair and have some pretty engaging drama. The standout is Jeffrey Dean Morgan as a government agent who doesn't just chew the scenery, he eats it all up (think Negan from ""The Walking Dead"" as a good guy); I smirk every time he's around. The villains are the weaker characters, cartoonish in their performances and plans (to be fair, the games were cartoony too), but they are serviceable in their roles. Now for the monster role call: George is the most relatable of the trio with a likable personality, more than sympathetic enough to root for and having a good friendship with the Rock. Ralph, though always my least favorite, is quite the menace, giving any foolish soldier stained underwear. Lizzie, my favorite of the bunch, sports the most wicked design and, despite only appearing in the third act, dominates the show and her mutant cohorts. The film certainly lives up to the title as it offers up a fine dish of action and mayhem, complete with moments perfectly replicated from the games like when the trio climb a skyscraper and just wreck the hell out of it and the detailed effects are handled elegantly. There are one or two moments requiring suspension of disbelief, but then again the franchise never aimed for complete realism. There's some good humor here too as I found myself chuckling several times.I'm happy this film didn't become a heap of trash like ""Doom"" and ""Super Mario Bros"". It delivered what it promised and offered a little extra for good measure. I dare say it has earned its place among kaiju films. Perhaps there is hope for video game movies after all.",Rampage

I mean, it is a monster movie based upon a video game a lot of us played in college, so you'd be wrong to expect some sophisticated plot.

Did the Super Mario Bros movie really inspire that many adaptions? However, this one drew me in with The Rock and Negan in the same movie, and I was pleasantly surprised.The movie starts off with some astronaut woman in space who we will soon forget about getting attacked by a small lizard thing. This is actually a good setup because I would have forgotten there was a lizard in this movie. Then we see The Rock and his ragtag group of a hot female and the nerd who was in The Wolf of Wall Street. Apparently The Rock can communicate with gorillas including a white gorilla named George who likes to give him the finger. Seriously, he does and it's actually quite funny.Soon a bunch of meteors hit and George gets infected and becomes bigger. He begins storming the city and gets captured. He gets transferred by plane where The Rock and some hot scientist woman named Dr Caldwell are transported. This is where we meet Negan. Yes, I know his name is Jeffery Dean Morgan but he hasn't switched off Negan mode in this movie. He even stumbles around like Negan too. An action sequence happens and The Rock rescues the girl and Negan as they parachute down. The plane crashes and The Rock mourns for his gorilla friend only to discover that he escaped somehow. Negan is now on their side and soon they all work together to stop the city from being rampaged by the gorilla, a giant wolf and that lizard we saw at the beginning of the film.The film is more enjoyable than I thought. I especially love the whole action sequence at the end and there was even some emotion involved. It was your typical fun monster movie that shouldn't be taken seriously. The only thing that really bothered me about the movie was the two bad guys who run the lab that created these monsters. They were just way too over the top and belong more as villains of a porno than a big budget action film but I digress.As far as video game movies go, this is definitely one of the better ones. It deviates a little from the arcade game it is based on, and honestly this is an odd choice to adapt into a movie. It does make me want to go back and play it again.",Rampage

180,MinistryofDoom,An Exciting Action-Adventure...if you sit back and just enjoy the ride,6,20 June 2018,"First of all this is based on an arcade game; an arcade game about giant animals that climb buildings and smash stuff. So there's really not a whole lot of back-story to the mythos. I don't know why they chose to do a movie about a game that has no story whatsoever, but they did and they invented the story so that it makes sense, but it doesn't. So if you're one of those people that can't suspend your disbelief and put away all the things you know about science and biology and just enjoy the action unfolding before you, then this film probably isn't for you.If you can do that and are you willing to invest about an hour and a half, you'll enjoy this film for what it is: an exciting popcorn flick. Now, even though the writing isn't that great, the saving grace that is able to carry this film from a total failure to a semi-enjoyable ride is the ever-charismatic Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson. Is there anything this guy can't do? Your answer to that question should always be a firm ""NO"". If this film starred anyone else, I probably wouldn't care but I like Dwayne Johnson......a lot. I think he's awesome. He's got a great personality, and he's able to inject that into all of his roles even if they're roles in ridiculous films like Rampage.In the end, you get what you came for: a giant gorilla, a giant wolf, a giant crocodile, and a giant WWE Superstar tearing up the city of Chicago. Isn't that reason enough to watch??",Rampage
181,achyutaghosh,Bigger is not necessarily better,6,15 April 2018,"Dwayne ""The Rock""Johnson is on a roll. Over the past few years, he has really owned the good big guy character, essaying that in blockbusters action franchises such as Fast and Furious and G.I.Joe, and standalone ones such as Hercules, and Pain &Gain. Earlier this year, he rocked with the reboot of Jumanji, and this week, he is back at the top with Rampage, which is perhaps the best live action movie adaptation of a video game.In the titular 1986 video game, you could play as a giant monster destroying cities all over while evading the military. In the live action movie though, there is a minor twist. The popular monsters in the game are all there- George, Lizzie and Ralph. But they are all animals that are exposed to a pathogen that causes them to not only grow exponentially, but also acquire other abilities such as increased aggression, intelligence, speed, strength and endurance- which roughly translates into imperviousness against bullets and bombs, but against the MOAB a.k.a Mother of All Bombs? We never get to know. ""Of course the wolf can fly"" Dwayne Johnson is a former Special Forces and member of an anti-poaching unit turned primatologist who shares a special bond with a albino gorilla with a twisted sense of humor (go figure) called George. When gene mutation pathogen samples from a space research station end up as debris and get consumed by a crocodile; and George and a wolf are also exposed to it, digital chaos begins. The military is useless, cities are evacuated, and buildings are razed. It is only in the third act, when George gets cured of his aggression, and then Rampage becomes George and Johnson against Lizzie and Ralph. Fair fight.""Weirdos in the internet are calling it Ralph"" - Harvey RussellWhile Dwayne Johnson gives it his all as if his life depended on it, Jeffrey Dean Morgan's cowboy Government agent Harvey Russell gets to spawn the best lines. This is the third collaboration between Johnson and director Brad Peyton (San Andreas and Journey 2: The Mysterious Island), and there is a bit of sameness in all of them- impassionate, digital disaster/adventure flicks. 
Rampage takes inspiration from Godzilla, King Kong, Rise of the Planet of the Apes but lacks their emotional connect. It is also bit confused- is it a movie about the relationship between man and animal, or a video game disaster flick? Bit of both in the end, but hard to discern for the viewer as how to take it beyond just a popcorn movie. Plus there is the small matter of disproportionate monster sizes- the same issue that affected Roland Emmerich's 1998 Godzilla.Rampage- enjoy it while it lasts at the theatres.

It's derivative (King Kong and any monster movie you've seen) and you wonder if this is the best of a bad bunch of scripts he's been given.The screenplay is bitty, patchy and has more plot loopholes than a Swiss cheese. Not that there's much of a plot. No wonder they had so many writers working on it - a shame they couldn't pull it together, particularly to remove the drag from the mid section. There are some nice lines - and lots of poor ones - which make you wonder if all the writers saw all the screenplay at the same time or just worked on individual sections or characters. Being a Johnson fan I sort of went along with 'his guys' but the baddies are cartoon characters and the 'monsters' are just your typical big monster destroying a city type of thing.A real shame coz Johnson can do much better than this.

189,justinwfirestone,"Meh, OK",5,19 April 2018,"It's perfectly fine to check your brain at the doors of the theater just before Rampage comes on. It's better that way, because if you keep your brain inside your head while trying to absorb Rampage, you'll find it beaten and concussed enough times to make you want to go to Dave & Buster's, but even that gets beaten and concussed, too, despite the continuity error of where it's located in downtown Chicago (FYI: it's not that close to the Chicago River; it's just next to the Aston Martin dealer).Rampage is light on rampage, heavy on unnecessary character development, and has a plot, I think. It's based on a classic coin-munching arcade game, Rampage, which starred George, Ralph, and Lizzie. The movie stars Dwayne, Naomi, and Malin.The Rock is the gorilla-whisperer, just like Chris Pratt is the velociraptor-whisperer. There is a whole lot of setup, ploddingly building to a belated showdown at Chicago's Willis Tower, which suffers so much damage, so much rampage, that it bends over, collapsed in utter exhaustion, almost as if a metaphor for something else.Unfortunately, the Rampage takes on too sentimental of a tone, has nowhere nearly enough campiness, and very few things get blowed up real good.

195,gerry_barnaby,Awesome adaption from a button bashing game from 1984,8,12 April 2018,"For those that don't remember or ever heard of Rampage, it's a 1986 arcade game by Bally Midway. Where player's take control of gigantic monsters called Lizzy (lizard), Ralph (wolf) and George (Ape) trying to survive against onslaughts of military forces as you try to win each round as you completely reduced the city building to rubble. The games rights are currently owned Warner Bros. via their purchase of Midway Games which over the years has evolved and changed.Gotta hand it to the director of this film, it one hell of a hard story to write considering this was just a button bashing game with hardly any story, to begin with. I'm pretty impressed with what he actually has done here. After the first few scenes as we're introduced to the main character of the film, we're given a reason to what happening, rather than the typical monsters just show up cliche storyline and cause chaos motive which most films seem to adapt.It especially works well as the science actually used in this film is actually real science with DNA splicing just without the monster defeat, but splice has been used for a while in science which is why this film is a slight cut above the rest. Yes, this film is a switch you're brain off type of film because there are moments in this film that defy all logic, but its extremely fun entertainment with it funny humour amongst all the chaos that happens around the main characters.All the cast of this film performance's are spot on with the dwanye showing a humanitarian side with George, especially using sign language to communicate was a brilliant idea which gives the film some realism. Naomie Harris bring a great performance playing Dr Kate Caldwell who has great onscreen chemistry with Dwayne, but where this film shines more is Jeffrey Dean Morgan character, I sense a few hints of negan from (the walking dead) in his character with that manor and the way he comes across just without the evil side, but you could still tell in his character he had a ruthless streak with a badass cowboy attitude.Malin Akerman actually pretty good at playing the ruthless villain in this film as the head of a company who caused this whole mess, but the ruthless side she does anything even put someone life in danger to get what she wants. This worked for her character along with Jake Lacy who I believe was playing her idiot bother who was her right-hand man in the company, his performance is perfect in playing the typical dumb coward type of person that would run away from anything. As for the film as a whole the C.G.I and story direction is pretty solid, considering it from a button bashing game, but I can see why some people may find this film a little dumb, but at the end of the day this isn't an intelligent film it's not meant to be, its a fun entertaining film that is meant to go the way it did. Adapting this type of game to a movie is hard the director has done a great job with it in my opinion. The monster design is fantastic, they change Lizzy and Ralph slightly but that understandable considering the science and DNA that was used in the experiment, but this is what it is a monster smashing chaos movie with good action scenes and good acting.If you a fan of the actual games this film won't disappoint, good direction, good acting, good CGI animation of the creatures, funny moments that will make you laugh, what more do you want? This is a film I recommended watching on the big screen totally worth watching. Dislikes: There was a moment toward the end The green screen effects did show slightly fake, there might have been an editing error but all in all this film wasn't that bad. The film age certification should've been a little higher than a 12A - PG13 as most of the moment was pretty vicious and bloody scene with some scary moments which may be too much for some younger viewers.",Rampage

My two glaring issues were these: Harry Dean Stanton plays the EXACT character that he plays on the Walking Dead. Clearly no acting stretch.

201,tmpsvita,If in the first half the film doesn't work in the second one it entertain but never as it want,6,14 April 2018,"Since the first announcement this ""Rampage"" has never particularly inspired me, except for the presence of Dwayne Johnson who, although he continues to interpret the same roles in the same way, works in any blockbuster; surely this little interest on my part is due to the fact that I have never played the videogame from which it is taken, so much so that I only came to know it after the aforementioned announcement.
Being a Hollywood blockbuster from the plot I did not expect anything exceptional but only of course many beautiful special effects and a good dose of healthy and enjoyable entertainment.
Having said that I must say that the first half of the film does not work absolutely, there is no entertainment and this directs the viewer's attention on the screenplay that, despite being written by four people, is perhaps one of the worst in terms of dialogues that result , even to the most inexperienced of the spectators, written in a really horrible way, they are cumbersome, not credible, often they are forced or stretched in the air, above all during the pseudo scientific explanations that are at the center of most discussions, among other things full of clichés until the last minute. There is also an attempt, also succeeded only in the second part, to add a little irony that in fact would not have spoiled at all, the film should have bet a little more on getting a little 'around, just like the ironic phrase impressed on the poster ""Big meets Bigger"".
As for the plot I'm not even underlining the lack of a thickness but at least it is quite acceptable for an entertainment product intended for a large audience composed for the most part by young people and average audience, of course there are some gaps and in the first part fails to involve but from the second half, thanks to a good number of special effects, very well designed and realized action sequences and a discrete soundtrack, the entertainment comes and so is the involvement, but never in massive quantities .
The film, in fact, is quite successful in the second half, but never fun as it would / should, perhaps due to a total lack of personality that prevents it from distinguishing itself from the increasingly large mass of blockbusters released in recent years, this also means little incisiveness that makes it easy to forget in the long term.
But as already said, Dwayne works, as well as Jeffrey Dean Morgan with which forms a great duo, certainly better than the one formed with Naomie Harris that instead appears quite flat like most of the characters, but the two villains are terrible ( yeah because the creatures were not enough) they ruin practically every frame in which they are present.

Kids are allowed to laugh. For me, this is a family movie, that remind us about the fragility of science, if people is playing like god, and how government could limit the potency of scientists who can create scientific experiment to help other people and how that speciments are not to be illegally used. The critic behind this movie is quite rational and useful to all people who tend to make science as a life in this nowadays time.

208,margulanabutrlov,Rampage Review,7,25 March 2019,"A shady technology company develops a process that turns innocent animals into giant killer monsters. Unfortunately, their serum infects the wrong animals, including the gorilla pal of zoologist Davis Okoye (Dwayne Johnson), putting the entire world at risk.
In Hollywood, if you have a really dumb idea for a movie and a lot of money to make it, you call The Rock. That's not intended as an insult; the guy is just the industry's greatest salesman. Two hundred and 60 pounds of oiled muscles and oil-free charisma, he can sell you things you thought you actively did not want: a Jumanji reboot, sequels to G.I. Joe and Journey To The Centre Of The Earth, films featuring Kevin Hart, Baywat... Okay, everyone has their limits. Rampage is a quintessential Johnson project. Based on a video game with no story or characters to speak of, from a time before many of his fans were born, it sounds like a dreadful basis for a movie. And it sort of is, but it's also sort of a lot of fun.
The original Rampage came out in 1986, when games were simple (you moved from side to side either punching things or shooting them or gorging on white dots and ghosts) and repetitive. And we were glad of it. In Rampage, players controlled one of three giant monsters - a wolf, a lizard, or a gorilla - and tried to destroy cities before the military could shoot them down and turn them back into the humans they apparently once were. Sacrilegiously messing with the canon, the Rampage movie does not feature humans becoming monsters. Instead, while trying to find a cure for cancer by ""gene editing"", scientists have (not-so) accidentally created a serum that turns normal animals into angry, enormous monsters. To avoid the prying eyes of the government and others who might notice titanic hamsters devouring Downtown, these scientists have been carrying out their experiments in space. But things go awry, the space station blows up, and several canisters of monster juice are sent hurtling to Earth. Two land in the wilderness and another crashes into a San Diego zoo, where Davis Okoye (Johnson) works with gorillas. His favourite, an albino called George, is affected by the serum and grows colossal and violent.
To pick apart the plot would be a waste of time, because it's purely functional. There's no subtlety or art to it, nor should there be. This is a movie about gorillas punching buildings. You don't want character work getting in the way of that. It's fine when the villains (brother and sister megalomaniacs Malin Åkerman and Jake Lacy) say they need to turn their office building's radio aerial into a giant-monster-homing beacon so had their tech guys ""modify it last night"". Because who cares how they did it? Equally, who's concerned that Naomie Harris' miscellaneously science-y character hacks a multi-billion dollar tech company using a thermostat she found in the fridge, because it's ""all connected to the same grid""? Logic is only going to slow things down. Those buildings won't punch themselves.
When it comes to the building-punching portion of the show, there could have been more of it. This very silly movie could actually have afforded to be a lot sillier. Brad Peyton, director of that other loony Rock joint San Andreas, doesn't keep his tongue always fully in his cheek and he sometimes seems to be shooting, misguidedly, for cool. Johnson is mostly playing his gags with an eyebrow waggle, but not all of the film has his broad confidence. Those villains could be camper, the action sequences could use some more visual gags to enjoy the absurdity of the conceit, and is it greedy to wish the massive gorilla, wolf and lizard were even bigger? Warner Bros. may already have Godzilla and King Kong up its very roomy sleeve, and was perhaps concerned about stepping on those extremely big toes, but when it comes to city-toppling beasts, there's always room for more. Rampage is big dumb fun, but not as big, dumb and fun as it could have been.",Rampage

The third act is too long (I guess it has to, since that's the part of the movie the videogame shows). It uses two times the same resource of George the gorilla coming and saving The Rock out of nowhere when he's against the ropes with the crocodile.

Chemical vials that can survive an atmospheric reentry and not be cooked into oblivion? Gorillas that sign-talk, have a sense of humor, laugh and make jokes? The most redeeming trait of this lampoon is that the bad guys and the monsters get it in the end, virtually splashing gore and tripes on you too. Serves you fine! ;-DThis film not only really takes the audience for stupids, but tells them to their faces and still manages to let you out of the theater grinning.Expect nothing but action and laughs plus gore, gore and more revolting gore every five minutes... and you'll get your money worth.I cannot honestly recommend it but if you are dragged to the theater by your kids or grandchildren you can certainly find worse ways to dump a couple of hours. Just don't expect anything but dumb fun all the way.",Rampage
214,mynameritesh,Dwayne Johnson Charms his way out in this stupid yet extremely entertaining flick.,7,20 July 2020,"RAMPAGE (2018) REVIEW
.
.
📜 Plot: When three different animals become infected with a dangerous pathogen, a primatologist and a geneticist team up to stop them from destroying Chicago.
.
.
👨‍⚖️ Review : Rampage is an cinematic adaptation of a 1980's arcade game where there giant animals create havoc in a city . Davis (Dwayne) is a primatologist and handler of one the creature George the white Gorrila.As the name suggest, the movie shows how the some creatures tear appart a city with civilization. The VFX is quiet superlative and movies is filled with action sequences throughout the course of its runtime. Now this movies is not for those who expect storytelling , brilliant acting or drama but is an all out entertainment show which you can watch with a bucket full of popcorns and still you will enjoy it.Director Brad Peyton has enough chunks of thrilling action sequences which you can enjoy in your big TVs. Dwayne Johnson has again proved why he is considered to be a bankable star when it comes to commercial success of a movie in Hollywood. He is dazzling and with a mix of humour his character charms you away with his mere presence. I am extremely grateful that a actor as fine as Jeffrey Dean Morgan is getting frontline roles who is a brilliant actor (Walking Dead Fame).👍Goods :
Dwayne Johnson's Charisma
Action Packed Sequences + VFX
Entertainment Package
.
.
👎 Bads :
Storyline is predictable.
.
.
🔥 Final Rating : 7/10
.
.
✅ Verdict : This movie is a commercial action flick with loads of adrenaline rush and heart pumping action and the amazing Dwayne Johnson. A definite one time watch .

215,vandelour,I liked the first half hour,3,22 June 2018,"What can I say? DJ is an appealing personality and he can say his line and hit his marks well. As for the projects he's offered or selects, well, thats something else. It was entertaining for the first half hour or so and with each iteration of a bigger badder mutant it became less entertaining. And just to make sure it stunk up the room, they put in some bizarre doofus with a country hick accent and made him an FBI agent. Watch it for the special effects (where have we heard this before) but not for anything else. And please, next time, kill off that female lead early on.",Rampage
216,Kirollos-Noah,It's better than I expected!,4,14 September 2018,"As a movie based on an arcade game, it really was nice.
Let's get to the movie, I enjoyed it, the way of the movie wasn't new, but it was good though!
I have four problems with this movie...
Firstly, sometimes the CGI was bad-made.
Secondly, they made George a human-eater for no reason, there was really the worst scene in the movie!
Thirdly, Where did Russell come from in the helicopter scene?
Finally, I hated the role of Jake Lacy as Brett Wyden!
But I loved the movie though!
I loved Dwayne Johnson, Malin Akerman and Jeffrey Dean Morgan.
And the story was good, the sense of humor too!
So apparently it's an usual movie, but it's somehow not for me.",Rampage
217,robinsonaustin-07490,Popcorn Spectacle,7,14 April 2018,"So I have seen Rampage yesterday, and one of the initial surprises that I actually had was that this film was based on a video game series. The basic premise is that there is a company known as Energyne that specializes in genetic editing. Three canisters containing a pathogen crash land to Earth, one happening to end up crashing into the gorilla habitat wherein an albino gorilla named George comes into contact with it. He becomes infected with the pathogen, growing to rapid size and becoming more aggressive.There were several parts of the film I did like. I personally felt that the two highlights of the film were Dwayne ""the Rock"" Johnson for his role of the primatologist leader of an anti-poacher unit Davis, and Jeffrey Dean Morgan of Walking Dead fame as Agent Russell. Both characters I felt gradually developed over the duration of the film. Davis was initially resentful towards other people because he saw the depravity that poachers could get themselves to, having seen them kill George's mother and adopting him. Russell starts out as an antagonist out to get the ape, to an ally. As for the other characters, they were more bland. Kate Caldwell played a genetic engineer who claims that she knows how to cure George and the other two beasties. She comes off as pretty flat; she does have a tragic backstory which does explain her motivation, I feel that they didn't focus too much on it. Then you have Claire Wyden, the head of Energyne. She comes off to me as your generic bad guy who's willing to level a city just to dissect the animals infected by her pathogen. Her assistant was here brother, and he is simply a terrible character. He is grossly incompetent and kind of insufferable. There were also some characters introduced earlier in the film that I thought were going to play a major role such as that one woman set up to be a possible love interest of Davis, but that didn't go anywhere as she disappeared without a trace along with the other minor characters.The visual affects were awesome. I loved the design of the mutated grey wolf and American crocodile. The wolf had quills aligning its back much like a porcupine (and skin flaps not too dissimilar to a flying squirrel), and the crocodile seemed to be a blend between a crocodile, boar, and frilled lizard. The action scenes were also intense, though some of the explosions I personally felt were partially tacked on. 
Other than that, it was a fun film. It's really just your average popcorn flick, but it is still enjoyable for what it's worth.",Rampage
218,Eclectic-Boogaloo,It's fun and as dumb as a Stegosaurus,5,16 May 2018,"They had brains the size of a Walnut, Stegosaurus's did... that's about as smart as Rampage is. So problem. I don't know how exactly to describe just how dumb this movie is without spoiling it. But I'll try:
When you establish that characters are human beings, as opposed to cyborgs or mutants, they have to play by certain rules. They can even defy the occasional law of physics, like the 'Fast and the Furious' crew, but they can't survive actually hitting the ground, so to speak.In Rampage, Dwayne Johnson's lead character, a Primatologist with prior military training, almost ruins the movie with a series of acts of valor that happen in the face of something that no human character should have been able to overcome. I mean, a movie has to establish what a character can and cannot do early in the movie and stick with it. Not just make the hero superhuman at the end just because.This section at the end of the movie was only the last and most egregious of the lazy screenwriting cheats employed by its writers, and such, to make their jobs easier at the expense of the audiences' intelligence. And yes, It was was insulting.That's a shame because Rampage was otherwise pretty fun and well made.
The actors: Dwayne Johnson, Naomie Harris, Malin Akerman, Jake Lacy, Jeffrey Dean Morgan and others, all acquainted themselves well.
The movie featured really good action sequences throughout, and a few dodgy CGI scenes aside, also really looked good. It was filled with pretty good thrills, chills, and even moments of genuine fright.
The monsters themselves are no secret as the trailers spoiled them, but the way that they were handled was really cool (though the plot mechanism to bring them together was really dumb).Like I said at the start, this movie has a number of incredibly dumb facets to the story that MIGHT ruin it for you. It's just that dumb. But if you can get past that, I think you'll find that Rampage is a decent time at the movies (preferably a matinee).",Rampage
219,RoboRabbit89,Rampage is a blast!,7,25 April 2018,"The first time I had heard of the game was back in 2009.
A buddy of mine had it on his Game Cube as a down-loadable game,
he and another friend was over, and we all played it, and we had fun.
Coincidentally he had said ""you know, this could make a good movie"".
I replied ""yeah it would, but only if it's done right"".Fast forward to 2018, and we now have a real live action movie.
I'll be honest I don't know much about the game, because I have 
only played it once, I did read a little bit about it, but I still don't know
very much, not that the game series have much story to begin with.
But I feel this film did a good job on turning it into a film.On to the film, this movie was great, it's a little corny but I like that
it wasn't taking it's self too seriously, but serious enough to stay
engaged with it and it's characters. Dwayne Johnson is great as Davis
Okaye who is an animal tamer (with a special forces background) that takes care of George an albino silver-back gorilla.
Meanwhile in space, when a mutagen experiment goes wrong in a
space station, the capsules containing the mutagen re-enter earth's
atmosphere and land conveniently by a pack of wild wolves (in this case
by one wolf) code-named ""Ralph"" by the military and the other capsule lands
by a swamp-marsh like area by a crocodile code-named ""Lizzie"" (and yes, it is 
female). The last one lands by George and makes all three animals grow
into giants, obviously this is the work of a sinister corporation, as the powers
that be comets project ""Rampage"" hens movies title.
And what a rampage it is, all three animals became aggressive and wreak
magnificent havoc to anything in their path. But it's up to Davis Okaye and a
former scientist (played by Naomi Harris) that use to work for the corporation
to find a way to get George to help, and stop the other monsters from destroying
the city and possibly the world.Comparison from game to film, honestly I liked it a lot better that it was
animals that get mutated, instead like in the game you play a person who gets
tricked into in experiment and become a creature. It seems if the film did it
that way, it would be way more complicated and seems too convoluted when
you think about it. But I felt the way the film did it was way smarter that some
give it credit for, I liked that the writer(s) simplified it enough to get you into
the movie a lot faster.My thoughts, I absolutely loved this movie great fun I recommend to all.
By far the best video game movie I have ever seen to date.Overall a great adventure from start to finish. I give it a 7/10.
Escapist fun at it's finest. Highly recommended.",Rampage
220,xherridea,Meh,4,14 July 2020,"I swear it takes skill to make a giant monster movie boring. The CGI looks bad. Dwayne Johnson plays the same character he always does and although there's some lewd jokes and swearing they could easily be edited out for TV allowing the The Rock to keep his family friendly appeal. The story is bare bones. The colour scheme is this drab grey and brown dusty thing, this doesn't help the tone of the film, which is trying to be upbeat and comedic. There are a few funny moments. The characters are meh and are used to big up The Rock's character.",Rampage
221,neener3707,Awesome Dumb Action Flick - Fun Movie Going Time,6,13 April 2018,"I was truly surprised, the trailer was NOTHING like the actual film. I went in expecting moderate CGI and nothing else, but what I got was an above average CGI action-fest with some things to say about friendship and loyalty. First of all the plot had much more detail than the trailer, the trailer did NO justice to this film as it is much better than much of the CGI laden crap nowadays. I didn't like some things, and I will get to that in the second paragraph. But man was the action well choreographed and was truly a fun spectacle to behold. The way the military faced these creatures was realistic (this coming from an Army veteran) and the way the filmed the action was just so well done, much better than some of the Marvel and other CGI films. The humor was also surprisingly not stupid and made me laugh on multiple occasions. I also liked the use of friendship, you really did understand the friendship between the characters.So there was some bad, mostly things that wouldn't happen and some plot problems but it really didn't make the film unbearable. First of all, two people under arrest would not be able to escape from a highly secure military air force base, let a lone take off in one of their med-evac chopper. Second of all they consider using a MOAB (Mother Of All Bombs) the largest non-nuclear bomb in US arsenal, problem is, we don't have any more after Trump dropped our last one on a Taliban compound. Again these are small details that didn't take too much away from the film, I still enjoyed it. Some of the cinematography was good in some places, but it was very average during dialog scenes. Action scene were well shot but most else was very average.If you are looking for beautiful thought provoking cinema, this isn't it, but if you are looking for a fun theater experience, look no further.",Rampage

And no, writing titles like ""what do you expect?"" and saying that it was not as garbage as I expected therefore it's good, saying anything like that proves one is seriously handicapped in making any objective assessment and should not be allowed to write any reviews anywhere.

This is a science fiction monster film loosely based on the video game series of the same name by Midway Games. The film stars Dwayne Johnson, Naomie Harris, Malin Akerman, Jake Lacy, Joe Manganiello, and Jeffrey Dean Morgan. It follows a primatologist who must stop mutated animals from destroying Chicago. As of June 28, 2018, Rampage has grossed $423.9 million, against a production budget of $260 million including promotion costs. It received mixed reviews and audiences gave the film an average grade of A-. This was a solid action movie, but some of the advertising budget should have been used to beef up the CGI.

225,hiraishinnojutsu,"Aside from the action scenes, this movie goes flat and meaningless",6,12 April 2018,"It seems that Bred Peyton hasn't learnt even a single bit about storytelling in movies from his previous project ""San Andreas"". If you already watched ""San Andreas"", I don't think you would even need to watch Rampage since it's basically the same movie with different plot and different kinds of disaster but with the same level of dullness and unfunny-yet-forced jokes. as usual, Dwayne Johnson is always cool in any movie he plays, but the one who Jeffrey Dean Morgan portrays in this same movie, is just..... out of place. I mean, why did Peyton think he had to make Morgan like a damn cowboy in a movie like this anyway? it's so cringeworthy to see him just teasing and making people around him seem annoyed by his bossing-around behavior (which is not cool at all, let alone badass!). the action scenes are pretty good though: brutal, unmerciful, and Peyton doesn't seem to hesitate to show some splattered blood and disembodied corpses. but still the the big-budgeted-over-the-top scenes did little to nothing on lifting the strength of the movie when viewers get overwhelmed by its boring and generic kind of storytelling.",Rampage

229,chris-h-3,Odd mix of kids old style Disney film with some uninspired violence and swearing.,3,19 June 2018,"I was surprised by the recent Jumanji film, which I didn't particularly expect to enjoy, but found to be well written, funny and with some good scenes of action. Rampage however suffers from a terrible script, paper cut out characters and action scenes of the fast moving, quick cut, can't quite see whats going on of the Transformers/Avengers film variety.I didn't care about anything or anyone in the film and I can't recall a single thing in it which seemed original or new. Given its a game with no plot and characters that they couldn't licence for this, where was Godzilla?, they did an okay job of framing it with some sort of story. Its just a shame it wasn't told with some originally or enthusiasm instead.During the film there were several 'call backs' to events earlier in the film with characters referencing things that they haven't seen or shouldn't be aware of, I guess that was just due to scenes being cut in editing.Also couldn't work out who the film was aimed at, it had scenes that seemed to be more written for younger children along with scenes of swearing and characters meeting bloody endings. I think it might have given the film a better overall tone if they decided if this was a kids film or one for adults, rather than wandering back and forth between the two.The only watchable part of the film for me was Dwayne Johnson who does seem to be able to bring charm and likeability to the most poorly written, one dimensional, characters.",Rampage

Beyond using the names, there's nothing to really tie this movie in with the game.You don't have a bunch of scientists mutated by radioactive waste. The powers the monsters have are completely random and make no sense, and the size difference is just ridiculous.The Rock does his usual cheesy action hero bit, which is what actually ended up being exactly what I expected.

It's a fun film with the mindless fun of a fast and furious movie. Rampage doesn't ask much from it's audience, I sometimes find that a good thing, because it doesn't ask you to think too much about what's going on, besides the fact that monsters are fighting other monsters.

Because of that, I watched a couple of movies only because he was in it.Let's be honest, most of them aren't very good. Predominantly they are more or less harebrained Action Movies where he is the shiny hero and does impossible stuff to save the day. Rinse and repeat.
If you don't think too much about it, they can be quite enjoyable though and most of them are very funny too.Rampage is different. Absolutely everything about it is abolutely bad. No amount of The Rock can save the idiotic ""plot"" or what is left of it beween the holes. Really bad acting all around and not a single funny moment. Malin Akerman acts like someone has put a gun to her head. Jeffrey Dean Morgan was the only castmember I found halfway decent.

He knows he isn't doing Shakespeare but he's having fun and gives his role the Rock. The film never takes itself seriously. It combines the right balance of campy and action.

While Dwayne Johnson is a great choice for a blockbuster action film, I hope people will understand the movie on a deeper level:* Animal experimentation must STOP. It's high time we stop exploiting the innocent. From Cosmetics to Medicine to Automobile performance (YES VW take note!) it is not our place to use them. Science and Engineering have evolved to the point where animal experimentation is no longer needed and way past the point of justification. * Poaching is a vile action. The ""My family was starving"" excuse does not pass. As someone who has seen the good and the ugly, what separates the two is how we act and react. For the 1 000 000 rotten people out there, and the 50 000 000 neutral, we have 100 decent souls striving to set things right. One good deed does not justify 100 bad ones no matter how desperate you are. You become the monster and, in that way, humanity at large loses our empathy, compassion and collective conscience. Action movies have become rather tedious but, for the first time, I'm actually going to watch this again because it had great lessons. I hope people didn't take the movie at mere face value but understood those stark lessons we not only need to absorb but also need to fight against.",Rampage

249,MichaelNontonMulu,An Entertaining Movie of Giant Animals Rampaging Throughout City of Chicago,8,12 April 2018,"Wooow, this movie was amazing in term of the action sequence. The giant gorilla, wolf and another animal that would be better found out when you see the movie (unless of course if you have seen the trailer that would let you know) were really cool, enormous and rampaging through out the whole city. The special effects of these animals/creatures were fantastically done and real life like. To my personal opinion, the greatest part of the movie would definitely be the giant monster scenes in Chicago. Of course the earlier part was also great (like the scene in the jungle and on the plane), but from the final third of the movie, it was totally awesome and made my wife and I really thrilled.But if you talk about the story itself, I felt that it was a tinsy bit too complicated. The movie seemed to be trying too hard on making the story sophisticated and also having many characters to support the story. However, I personally felt that it became a bit complicated and was not simple enough to grasp. Perhaps it would be more realistic had it been simplified a bit, like in Jurassic World where the story was simple enough to understand (could not help but feel there was a little similarity with that movie, having Chris Pratt as a friend to few of the T-Rex which later on ran amok). Which is why I could understand for audience who were looking for very smart monster movie might be disappointed as its main focus seemed to be aimed at making us amazed on those giant monsters. Don't get me wrong though, my wife and I personally really really enjoyed the movie, but there is possibility that critical audience would not like it.Anyway, I did not get to see the end credit scene till finished as half way through it, the operator had switched off the projector (perhaps he thought no one else around), so I did not see if it had any post end credit scene. Btw, I understand that this movie was loosely adapted from a 1986 arcade game with the same title where players would take control of George, Ralph (the wolf) and another character called Lizzie which were originally people who could transformed into those creatures and rampaging through out various cities. So the movie was quite different from the game play. I am not sure if this would appeal to the fans of the games, but if they just want to enjoy seeing those creatures came to life in this movie, then it would certainly not disappoint.Overall, this is a movie that was entertaining if you disregard the logical parts. It has few funny moments and great action finale sequence, and it even had a touching moment as well (though my wife was only a bit affected). If you are looking for giant animals rampaging city and fight against military, then this movie is definitely for you.For my complete review, please have a look at michaelnontonmulu.blogspot.co.id",Rampage

251,AverageJoesDriveInPodcast,"A great sit back, relax and have fun type of film",7,21 July 2018,"This movie is a lot of fun. There are a lot of epic battle sequences. The FXs are rather good and some genuinely funny moments scattered throughout the film. Those moments come from the relationship and interaction between George & Davis. They even managed to put in some nice little nods to the video game without having them seem too out of place. They fit within the context of the story. The acting is actually quite solid all the way around.In all honesty, if it wasn't for Dwayne Johnston's charm and charisma this film might not have worked so well. He has an innate ability to elevate a film that few action stars have, part of that is due to him having the ability to nail stuff with expression and great timing. I feel like I've said this a lot lately, but it's worth repeating. Too often we nitpick films to death and don't just sit back and enjoy a fun movie for what it is. With that in mind, I have really been trying to go into films with that mindset. This is a fun popcorn flick that I think honestly has potential to have great replay value. A great sit back, relax and just have fun type of film.My Rating: 7/10",Rampage

To be honest i really wanted to watch this film and to my surprise very disappointed. The plot was all over the place with not so likable characters and terrible humor. I normally love almost all movies, but this one did not cut it. I recommend watching the film on your own time and if you can try watching the film for free and no cost because I would not waste my money on it.

Grown ups, most of them, accept that watching monster movies and their ilk, requires absolute 100% suspension of disbelief. It's a fun fair ride, that's all.
But, and it's a big but, it's imperative that the actors take it seriously. At least pretend to. Pretending is the first requirement to acting. So, when Jeffrey Dean Morgan plays his character for laughs and over acts it it makes the audience think if he can't be bothered to do his job - a very well paid job - why should we bother to watch what is basically a load of crap.

256,CobertNeede,"Tomb Raider lifted the curse, Rampage brought it on again",3,13 April 2018,"With so much reviews and people claiming that the curse on video game adaptations has been lifted with the onset a well scripted and executed Tomb Raider, Rampage will prove you wrong. Rampage is really dumb. Like really dumb. Prepare for the worst video game adaptation since Mortal Kombat : Annihilation and although a pretty fun one at that. Every now and then, Dwayne Johnson have a urge to produce slack and sloppy movies ; and i can assure you he hasn't disappointed.With the formulaic action, cliched dialogues and an unbelievable amount of
unadulterated cinematic junk. The visuals, the camera work, and the way the plot advances are all well done. When you have the rock take on three giant hybrid beasts, it is a must you have these pros. Rampage starts with the usual genetic editing and crap like that used in every monster film(K:SI an exception).
For casual movie-goers and for people who really don't want to go into detail what's happening, Rampage might be the perfect treat for them. Some of the dialogues were more than dumb ; literally shoots straightforward lines, as if trying the guide the audience on what is happening. That's a very good way to break the fourth wall by the way. Dwayne Johnson 'The Rock' provided his usual action movie performance. Naomie Harris's Dr. Kate Caldwell did the explanation arc to every possible problem, sometimes out of thin air. Agent Russel portrayed by Jeffrey Dean Morgan, who came in frequent sucessions, was the only comedic relief throughout the movie ; that actually worked.In spite of a never ending 'Rampage' and endless action and fun, the viewer cannot ignore the amount of dumbness the film emits and how predicable everything is, so a perfect 'no' from me.",Rampage
257,iamianiman,Big Meets Bigger Critics in 2018!,5,11 April 2018,"When you hear Rampage, I'm pretty sure the first think that comes into your mind is the 1997's Rampage game that took the world by storm. I never got my hands dirty except for the 2006 on PS2 which was a great game at that time.This 2018 video game adaptation movie has been in ubiquitous mode since Winter last year but does it live up to people's expectations? With the tagline Big Meets Bigger, you can see how the irony is properly done just by looking at the poster.To kick things off, the story line here is another typical monster movie with its focus on genetic variation and editing on DNA which under nature circumstances, alters the attribution and characteristics of the animals overall, simply mutating it to be bigger, bolder and badder. It cares about the story but what is lacking here is the failure to tell the story smoothly. It goes from one sub-story to another and back to the precedence and it all jumbles up with the endless jokes, the cheesy dialogues and the menacing scenes.It's hard to follow on the characters in a sci-fi movie but this should be excluded as they care enough to tell each background story not just regarding the main characters, but also George aka the gorilla which plays a crucial role as it is the main centre of the movie. If you say the development in Planet of the Apes is great, then this will be too albeit not as great as the former.Talking about The Rock, I'm gonna be honest, since Journey 2: The Mysterious Island, I never quite liked him. I thought there's something off about him on screen and his smoldering intensity is sometimes unsuitable and in vain. Same can be said to this movie, I appreciate that he is trying but there are times that he is the main central power that actually weakens the movie but I got to say, overall he is good. As for Naomi Harris, her acting is dressed nicely and she is suitable with the character she's playing. As for others, those cheesy dialogues just switch off the energy within them even for Malin Akerman that feels like she's reading a script.One thing I dislike about Rampage is the shaky cameras and the close angles they give to the audience during any action or destruction scene that occurs. The editing is rubbish and it is hard to see what is actually happening in details. However, the destruction scenes at the end are simply well-put as at that particular time, wide angles are being used and you probably reminisce the game you have played before.Another negative perspective is on the very various things they want to tell in a story. It starts off so relax but gets messier as time flies by and at the end, it swifts lazily and gives up mid-way patching plot holes here and there.
Overall, it's a typical monster movie with some cool action scenes and good character developments however, it's not enough to bring justice to the money that you have willingly paid for the movie. Planet of the Apes series and Kong: Skull Island are better but to compare this with the latest Pacific Rim, opt for Rampage. 57/100",Rampage
258,walkingwithprimeval,Shame this isn't part of Legendary's MonsterVerse,7,15 March 2021,"Rampage (2018) is the purest form of daikaiju film you can possibly imagine. Everything you can think of is present and accounted for in this. It's just a simple joy seeing these really big animalistic monstrosities wreaking havoc by smashing-up a large city, with army soldiers trying desperately in vain to stop the enormous creatures using their advanced military weaponry, repeatedly firing at them from all sides. Oh yeah, and all the monsters eventually come together to have a spectacular punch-up, beating the living daylights out of one another until one of them comes out on-top and ends-up as the movie's victorious winner (it's very much like a glorified boxing match). And yes, it even continues the tiresome tradition of including the ""greedy, soulless businessman"" cliche (personally, I'm so sick of seeing this overdone trope). Gareth Edwards' Godzilla (2014) reboot, despite how much I really don't like it, deserves some recognition for spawning a new era of monster mashes and garnering in a new generation of loyal fans. So along with Guillermo del Toro's Pacific Rim (2013), Godzilla's massive commercial success helped give us Brad Peyton's Rampage (which is a nice consolation).The VFX work in this film is about what you'd expect from a modern big-budgeted Hollywood film, by which I mean it's some topnotch quality (there's nothing here that's groundbreaking though, but rather it's just fairly standard nowadays for this type of summer blockbuster). The digital textures on our troublesome trio of titanic-terrors were very well-rendered with such surprising detail, making each of the three different CGI models appear abnormally grotesque and gain new hybridisation attributes and abilities uniquely-suited to them as individual kaiju characters (you can tell the visual-effects team didn't squander any of the movie's budget on menial shots because all that money is clearly shown onscreen whenever the big action set-pieces occur). Unlike many other kaiju soundtracks which make you feel the foreboding threat of an incoming monster attack, Rampage offers a more action-oriented musical score which is sure to get the blood pumping. Speaking of the music, composer Andrew Lockington also worked with director Brad Peyton on his previous disaster film, San Andreas (2015), which also just happened to have former-pro-wrestler Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson star as the heroic leading man (so in a funny sort of way, it's almost like one big San Andreas reunion).The title is true to its word, as the third act has all the monsters congregate in one location (specifically Chicago) going on a massive rampaging path of destruction, tearing-down the surrounding skyscraper buildings and other man-made structures that are in their way. And the best part about this is that you can actually see all the creatures facing-off against each other onscreen, thanks to the daytime setting. Not to harp on this side-tangent too much, but who thought it would ever be a good idea to set an action fight scene at night? In the 2014 Godzilla, all three creatures had a charcoal black colouration to their overall aesthetic design, so they wouldn't have been able to properly standout in the dark. Battles set primarily at night aren't really to my liking (unless it's Pacific Rim), which is why I adore Rampage for having its fights take place during the daytime, when we can actually see them (that's the whole appeal of watching a giant monster movie). And while it may not be on the same epic level as something like the knuckle-dragging, bar-brawling scrap in Jordon Vogt-Roberts' Kong: Skull Island (2017), the visceral fights still get the job done of providing the viewer with an entertaining royal rumble.There's a lot of entertainment value to be had with something like Rampage. It's very much on-par with Kong: Skull Island, in the sense that it's a wildly enjoyable thrill-ride of modern entertainment with integrity. It's not pretending to be anything more than what it just is, which would be some harmless, unapologetically dumb fun done on such a large-scale (and there's absolutely nothing wrong with that, at all!). If you're in the right mood and frame-of-mind, then it'll surely satisfy your craving for a crazy creature feature with lots of brutally monstrous mayhem.",Rampage

The Good""Fits genre brilliantly"".
""Tense music"".
""Plenty of action"".
""Heart felt characters"".
""Emotion and comedy"".
""Diverse character range"".
""Brilliant ending"".
""Good opening"".
""Some surprises"".The Bad""Plot a little predictable"".
""A little mediocre in some mid-parts"".
""Some events too unrealistic"".IntroductionIt feels like only yesterday I watched an action packed movie, featuring a great ape. Which is probably because it ""was"" yesterday. Today I review another with a great ape.
For comparison purposes, this is great news. Today I review Rampage, a 2018 Sci-fi, action. Find out right now if this or Kong: skull island is the best watch. Don't look away though, you don't know what rampaging creature will emerge behind you.StorylineThe storyline here, fits the genre much better than Kong did. There was actually science here. Plenty of scene diversity, and never a dull moment, keeps you following tightly the intricacies of the tale.
The storyline featured each main character enough for you to get to know them. Whilst again, the storyline was a little predictable, this kept it suited to a whole family audience. It wasn't totally without surprise either though. The film created an enjoyable, mostly effortless watch, with enough complexity to satisfy my desires.
Enough mysterious material allowed the 2 hr duration to evaporate in the blink of an eye. This is how it should feel with any long film which warrants it's duration.GenreAs said, Sci-fi/action was the perfect genre for this film. Action was never far away and I can't say I was ever bored throughout this film. The Sci-fi element was there sufficiently, with epic creatures as suggested by the Rampage title.
CharactersPlenty of background to get to know each of the characters was provided. The range of bravery, love and motivations was played creatively in this film. Casting was diverse, and the main roles were played by some of my favourite names. Even those who weren't well known, got into character well for minor and major parts.Film can be like an orchestra. Without the strings it wouldn't sound right, even though drums are louder.The effective character playing both emotionally and logically, made the storyline spring to life. I actually found myself feeling sorry for characters, undergoing tough times. There was enough comedy to lighten the mood too. Towards the end, I felt part of the set. Earlier on in the film, things were still good, but not quite as engaging as the ending.
MusicThe music was always suspenseful, yet fitted harmoniously with the themes of the plot of the time. It was withdrawn where necessary, to act as a tension building device.
SummaryGreat fun family Sci-fi action, with some engaging acting. With a little plot development earlier on, and slightly more believable action scenes, the film could have become an ace watch. For the record, this beat Kong: Skull island in my book.See full article on reaseadotorg.",Rampage

261,ryanbartlett-870-746486,The Rock fights animals.,3,20 April 2018,"There, you have the entire movie in a nutshell. If you are looking for drama or uncertainty or any sort of plot, not your movie. If you're looking for the Rock to fight animals 10 times his size, then come see it.
 As far as the plot goes, they explained in detail literally everything that is happening, people were practically yelling out every motion they made. I think they said that the animals were running to the tower almost 5 times, when we all very clearly could see it for ourselves.
 The acting didn't even make up for the lack of plot, the fight scenes were very cg made and all on a green screen. The Rock as an action star we have seen many times before, but this one he really didn't seem authentic. Also found throughout were ""emotional"" points, where Naomie Harris tried to explain how her life is so awful and she has this dark back story, but it was very weak portrayal and no one believed it. She almost threw in her brother's death as ""oh yah this happened.""
 The best part of the film and really the only thing people are even going to see, is the giant animals that in all of their cg goodness look incredible. George is by far the most loveable, enjoyable, and most convincing character in the movie. We care way more about the monkey than the rock. Come for the rock, stay for the monkey.",Rampage

Ik it is not a movie meant to be taken seriously, and at the same time, we got three giant monsters...a Kong sized gorilla, a giant wolf, and a giant croc.... Couldn't ask for more!The friendship between Rock and George was very entertaining!!! The Rock was...the Rock as usual, but ALWAYS entertaining! JDM was pretty much Negan in a suit, which actually worked anyway and JDM was awesome! I thought he was gonna be a villain in this, but I was totally wrong!The action/disaster scenes were VERY well done and had me shook seeing three mutated zoo animals wreck havoc in a big city! It was sort of a tag team until George took a chill pill and kicked a$$ himself against the other two animals! Like I said, three monstrous animals as a tag team is all I could ask for in a movie like this.And at the end, George totally had me with playing dead 😂 I really liked him! And Dwayne's reaction to that, and a couple of other gestures from George that follow, that was perfect! 😂 I would not mind a sequel to this!A couple of things I did not like about this, was the guy who Negan Russell tricked into get pancaked by debree outside, he was cringey in this movie... And some of the dialogue in the movie was cheesy and really cheap.When it came to the humans, Rock and JDM were the best parts.

I mean, ""Dwayne Johnson vs. Giant Animals""... what about that is not awesome?The first thing that impressed me about the film was that, while it still did not have an immensely deep story, the plot was rather well explained and I always knew what was what and who was who. Even the action (though huge) was not too confusing, unlike the work of some directors I know, i.e. Mr. Bay. The plot has just enough ""personal"" backstory on some of the characters to make you kinda care, but not so much that I fell asleep - there were no love triangles or complications.The actors, while not breathtakingly charismatic, are fair enough to pass. I really do not understand why this has so many negative reviews on IMDb. Don't see this film expecting a BBC style drama - it's called 'Rampage' - expect a wild action movie!The only bad thing I can say about it is that a handful of the lines were a bit cliche.

They're each the result of a chemical company's experiment in space that went awry, sending capsules containing a deadly pathogen crashing across the good ol' US of A. Cue massive CGI damage and scenes of structural destruction as the monsters go on their titular rampage and fight off the military trying to evacuate Chicago (in the 90s it was always New York that took a beating but now it seems to always be Chicago, doesn't it?).The plot is as loose, woolly and clichéd as they come - a corporation of morally bankrupt suits want to get their hands on the weaponised DNA-altering gas while the good guys want to apply the antidote. Dwayne Johnson does his thing playing the everyman (who just happens to be built like a brick privy) who is thrust into the most ridiculous scenarios and always comes out alive. Jeffrey Dean Morgan (best known for playing the baseball bat wielding super-villain Negan in The Walking Dead) is also worthy of note as a US Government official who at first is resistant to our heroes but soon offers them assistance to defeat the creatures. He essentially plays the character as Negan (complete with the unique way he emphasises some words in a sentence) but if he was a cheekily likeable good guy and it's absolutely brilliant to watch.A direct comparison can easily be made between Rampage and the far inferior Pacific Rim: Uprising. Both came out within a month of each other, both feature big beasts bashing buildings and both include humans caught in the crossfire. However, where Pacific Rim failed to present any fun in its mind-numbing destructo-physics, Rampage nails what this film is meant to be: big, loud and dumb, never over-complicated (which Pacific Rim definitely was!) and gets to the big-bucks action within 40 minutes where PR:U took most of the film. It's the perfect 1990s summer blockbuster for a braindead audience (I liked it at least!) and the best video-game-to-movie adaptation to date.Best Quote: *The Rock while choking out an army guard having already explained exactly what he was going to do* ""Shhhh, shhhh, shhhh.

Very few names carry this weight on box office anymore.The effects are very good, the story simple enough to string the action pieces together without you going 'hang on, but that....', you just don't care, you go with it, enjoy the quips and get behind the big white ape and his little co-star. :)I went to see it twice at the cinema and thoroughly enjoyed leaving my brain in the foyer on both occasions.

No dark secrets, blackmailers or tragic pasts. The bad guys are not scheming villains who have to outsmart the good guys, they just have to be good at being bad.2. Good triumphs over bad. No twists or frustrating subplots, the good guys win the day while the bad guys get stomped or eaten.3. Don't overdo the computer graphics. It doesn't have to be incredible and you don't have to level a city like that Superham. It just has to be believable.4 Keep an eye on the 'Fun' meter. Have fun at the start, fun in the middle and fun at the end. A monster movie is not the place to indulge in drawn out bouts of agonising introspection. It just has to entertain and the audience should leave with a smile.5 Keep the pace.

When the plane crack they jumped with parachute it's really very bad acting and Cinematography is terrible. In the end when show emotional part it has to Dwayne to at least show some tears on his eyes because the story about how this man have very strong relation with this gorilla and everyone if he lose someone that love him it will defiantly feel very sad  The story is poor because science fiction is too weak. Jorge the gorilla they make it so funny but also make it so far from reality and when the military fire many rocket to the wolf and Jorge they show them that they didn't even scratches. In the end it doesn't show what happening to Jorge they take it to where and how is dealing with.The green screen in some moments is amazin but after destroying the building all place is full of dust the green screen is wick and you can recognize it that's not look like real",Rampage

Rampage isa brilliant couple of hours of pure enjoyment where you're free to marvel at how good the CGI is, how enjoyable JDM is to watch, and how massive Dwayne Johnson's arms are.

A movie to be based on a game that hardly had a strong storyline or characters, it's hard to delevelop a script to include these missing pieces and yet to maintain the essence of the original game which is monsters tearing city apart.Everything from storyline to acting and to action is top notch and even CGI were par from what we have seen in recent big blockbusters. Of course it's not a perfect movie and has its ups and down perhaps I was expecting to see a little more of destruction but that's ok given the runtime the movie had.

Of course when they become large there is a side effect, they get angry.
Never mind Dwayne and the future love of his life will save the day but only after the city is wrecked.

Film Review
By Nelson Nantanapibul
Directed by Brad Peyton
Starring: Dwayne Johnson, Naomie Harris, Malin Akerman, Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Jake Lacy
""The Rock"" Dwayne Johnson stars as Davis Okoye a zoologist who has a mysterious past that is only hinted at but never explored. The film Rampage is a blockbuster sized version of a Syfy style B-movie. Don't go in expecting a lot of character depth, a great plot or a story that makes much sense. This is a popcorn monster flick through and through like the Kaiju movies of old. This film is based on the 80's arcade game of the same name which I played a lot as a kid but was never very good at. Which is why I never became a gamer later in life.
Joining Dwayne is Naomie Harris as a scientist who was involved in the making of the serum that made the monsters in the film possible and Jeffrey Dean Morgan plays a government agent who is the Johnson's frenemy in the film. This film has some pretty good big budget special effects and some pretty awesome action sequences. But most importantly of all the film has monster on monster violence. Check out this film and check your brain in at the door and have a good time.",Rampage

336,imperator-ming,The 2018 Moose Test for your Suspension of Disblieve,3,3 August 2018,"This is not the worst movie ever, and if you like the big guy, you will get your money's worth.My favorite moment was when after a scene of utter destruction with our heroes right in the middle of it, one of them says: ""I can't believe we survived this!""That made me laugh. Not just because it made sense. But because I happen to know that this is actually a narrative trick, right out of the ""Book of Bad Movie Making"", to make it easier for the audience to accept the unbelievable.Well, it didn't wok. This Moose Test was just too tough for me.",Rampage
337,Mrbrown43,Rampage review: Massive animals punch things,5,18 May 2018,"One of the many benefits to having such a large verity of entertainment is there is something for everyone. Sometimes people want to watch something thoughtful like A beautiful mind and sometimes you just want to watch something fun and stupid like Independence day or Alone in the dark. Both are perfectly valid viewing experiences and none of them should be treated as lesser. You can have fun and enjoy something even if you know it is rubbish. So now we have Rampage another in a long, long line of fun trash.Rampage tells the heart warming tale between a man (Dwayne the Rock Johnson) and a Grarilla named George. This heart warming tale goes on for a total of five minutes before a strange gas infects George and a 2 other animals and makes them large, extremely aggressive and extremely powerful and Dwayne the Rock Johnson and some other characters to save the city of Chicago from being smashed to bits and find a cure. The story and characters are not what one would call deep, they are just archetypes that exist to spout exposition and be charming. Dwayne the Rock Johnson is very likeable and does perform well enough. The relationship between Dwayne and George is sweet even if most of the jokes fall flat and the few that don't grant a smile. The villains a group of executives running a research company known as Energyne which runs much like if Weyland Yutani merged with Umbrella and had more boring motives for letting horrors against nature loose upon the people of Chicago. All they want is money and that is worth betting on millions dying as well as the terrible PR that would happen after it gets discovered. Why do you have such dull motivations for what are two Captain Planet villains that will not work at all once it either clears up or everyone dies and there would be nothing to spend the millions they would selling the bad gas thing.The story kind of stops once the crazed animals reach Chicago, from there until the end of the movie after that it is all about smashing buildings to the point of meaninglessness, The Rock shots and screams a lot and the villains get disposed of in the most anti-climatic way humanly possible. While it is enjoyable to watch stuff breaking there is not really much done in terms of characters or story to make it matter that much or have the audience be invested in the final fight and it does not stay with you once the film stops.However I would recommend it if you want something mindless and fun to watch during gathering of friends then it would be perfect. I would not say it is a good movie per say despite the good performances though.",Rampage

Maybe it was because I wanted to, but I believed in the friendship right away and so enjoyed the movie. I was very glad that a few of the really cheesy bad lines that were in the trailers were not in the movie, I would have liked it less.Most of the lines hit really well. This was a great action sy fy flick. The monsters were great and terrifying. The people behind the big bads were good, buy not great, a little over the top, but didn't kill the movie. It is close to being a family action movie with some naughtiness coming from the ape. I highly recommend seeing it, if it seems like the type of movie that you would normally enjoy.",Rampage

347,obiegimmie,"'Rampage': A Fun, Entertaining Action Movie That Remembers To Be Dumb",6,14 April 2018,"""Rampage"" was a film with which I found easy and fluid escapism. I appreciated that it was self-aware especially concerning its constraints and limits. I think the film managed its cast of characters quite nicely, and while no one can say this is a captivating character study, it can be said that the actors maintain a nice stage presence and remember to provide discernible traits, flaws, and even charms. I liked how Naomie Harris and Johnson worked together. I liked their chemistries and I felt that the main cast generally fit, with the exceptions of the main villains. The two bad guys are cookie-cutter corporate bad guys and any enthusiasm or passion from the two actors is lacking. Their motivations were almost comically laughable and their plan in order to execute these goals even more so. Yet this is not the type of film where you need to even be invested in a villain. I found myself immensely interested in George, the albino gorilla displayed on all of the promotional posters. The interactions between George and Johnson all seemed fairly well done and it definitely held some weight to it. Nothing here is really well developed, don't get me wrong, but it can be argued that nothing here was ever supposed to hold any emotional investment or grounding. This movie is loud. Loud and gory. I almost brought my 12 year old little brother to see it with me, yet I am extremely relieved now that he declined. I usually do not take issue with the MPAA rating in my reviews and I am certainly not suggesting that this movie should be rated R, but you should know about this especially if bringing a child. You have seen dozens of these movies and you will see dozens more. The big, stupid, loud cinematic mess that perfectly summarizes ""Rampage.""6/1060%C+",Rampage
348,augustkellerwrites,Noisy & Cheap,4,4 June 2018,"Excessive explosions, inconsistent one-liners, and lazy storytelling. We've come to expect these tired tropes from pictures starring B-movie champion, Dwayne Johnson and his newest release, Rampage, delivers it all in droves. While the script does put minor efforts into creating characters & relationships, much of the story recedes into sorry excuses for one excessive action sequence after another. Again, that is what a movie like Rampage is supposed to do to a certain extent but this film often slips into pointless, incoherent chaos.The limitations of Rampage's action (from production to direction to writing) would be more excusable if the entire film wasn't centered around it. All narrative scenes are executed with a level of disinterest that can only be described as negligent. In fact, some of the more emotionally dramatic moments feel outright inappropriate as this movie clearly wants to get on to blowing more stuff up. In the end, the charm of Dwayne Johnson, the playful supporting cast and the special effects all have their moments but the positives of this movie are mostly washed out by its noisy and cheap qualities. A film that hardly has any interest in itself, there are better movies to see than Rampage.Writing: 2/10

You shouldn't expect some groundbreaking story, from this kind of movie.I had my doubts about this movie, the trailer made it look silly, and kind over the top crazy, but I'm happy to say, I was very surprised by it.Dvayne does his usual acting, wich I think is good, though he plays almost exactly the same character from most of his movies.Some of the other characters, are played by less good actors, but not bad enough to ruin the movie.The movies main attraction, is ofcourse the monsters, and honestly the CGI was way better than I expected, to the point where some of the scenes where truelly awesome to look at.The action in the movie was great, and did a good job of starting with more down to earth action, and progressively getting bigger and bigger, throughout the film.The sound effect and music was outstanding, and really made the whole movie a great experience to see and hear.If you judge the movie, on what it tried to be, I honestly think it was amazing.
Sure some actors, weren't overly convincing, and sure the story weren't groundbreaking, but as a monster movie, it was entertaining from start to finish, and surely a movie I could watch more than once.",Rampage

It's never going to win an Oscar but if you want two hours of sheer unadulterated pure entertainment then see this movie!Unlike most muscle-bound action stars the Rock can act, again I doubt he'll ever get an oscar but he enjoys making fun nonsensical action movies and he does it well.Where this film excels is by not taking itself seriously - it knows it's ridiculous and relishes the fact. Full of almost every cliché you can think of, full of mindless destruction and full of just the right amount of humour. Perhaps surprisingly you may get a lump in your throat now and then too.Hands down THE best movie based on a video game (not a high bar I know, and the recent Tomb Raider is a close second) and up there with the best action movies too.Sit down, grab a coke or beer, forget reality, forget rationality and sit down for two hours of sheer bloody fun!!",Rampage

The science was as superifical as the movie itself. There was no depth and all points were one sided. I felt the movie had the opportunity to engage in a true conversation surrounding restorative justice when it comes to animal rights and how humans engage in it but missed the mark to hone in on an animal glorification movie. Plus the villians were the only interesting thing about the movie and they horrendously mishandled and mistreated, exposing another missed opportunity.

376,dwgmartin-33760,Silly but Forgettable,5,27 April 2018,"Rampage: based on the vid... Rampage is stupid. I enjoyed it but my god it's ridiculous.So, Rampage is about 3 CGI animals accidently genetically enhanced by an evil corporation (because of course there's an evil corporation) destroying a city; while Dwayne 'baby oil' Johnson, as a zoologist (aka Dwayne Johnson), tries to save his ape friend who's been turned into one of the rampaging monster. To give Dwayne Johnson some credit the man can sell anything with his charm, charisma and muscles. In Hollywood, if have a really dumb idea and a lot of money to make it, you get Dwayne Johnson and people will see it. And Rampage is definitely a dump idea with even less concept of a story than its source material, a video game from the 80s. The original Rampage had humans turn into the animals with science gone wrong, the movie decides to drop this idea and just makes the animals bigger and add more teeth. But for a movie about big CGI monsters punching a city, there's a hell of lot of humans. And humans with backgrounds. This is Rampage, why bother? Other than Johnson the characters are all cardboard cutouts of the usual clichés- I've already talked about the evil corporation, there's also angry military men, quirky sidekicks and (my favourite) a cowboy government agent played by Jeffrey Dean Morgan. You hear about actors chewing the scenery, Jeffrey Dean Morgan completely pigs out on the movie. So with all these characters the actual rampage of Rampage is only the last 20 minutes of the movie, and yeah it's pretty awesome. But you get the feeling that this sillyness could have actually benefited from being even sillier. Camper villains, more absurdity, and is it too much to ask for even bigger monsters? Throw away realism and give people Godzilla sized monsters. Not going all out with its possible insanity, Rampage unfortunately will become almost instantly forgotten. I give Rampage a C-",Rampage

Jeffrey Dean Morgan is actually the only good character in this movie. The guy has some epic acting skills. He has been in actual good movies/shows like The losers, the good wife, Watchmen and The walking dead. Why did he even sign to play a role in this awful, shaky cam type of movie? Maybe he gets paid well. That is the only logical reason i can think of why an amazing actor like Jeffrey dean morgan is in this terrible movie. 
And don't get me wrong, The rock is an amazing actor as well. But his character in this movie was so terrible that i almost walked out of the cinema.

I think the movie makers decided that the only way they could make a testosterone fueled movie was to not add in female characters that matched them, but to add in female characters that take the mickey out of the typical type of male lead these movies feature.

Dwayne Johnson like or loath him is a very bankable actor and I have to admit he can carry the show quite well given where he came from and the type of movies he gets cast in at the moment (I'm sure he tries hard to forget the ""tooth Fairy""). I would really like to see him in something where he might be able to stretch his acting muscles instead of his own. over all I was not bored which for me is a good sign the movie did something right. I would recommend this to you if just want to have a good monster movie with some good action and some lighter moments that are not corn ball at the expense of the film. my only grip is with Jeffrey Dean Morgan who those into Walking dead will know him from his role Negan. he played this part a lot like his character from his TV series and I found this really stupid and made me dis like him intensely if this was intended by the director it didn't work and I think is drew the movie away from its course. I mean even Dwayne's character wanted to punch him and so did I",Rampage

Hardly shows the mutated animals George, Ralph and Lizzie it mainly focuses of Dwayne Johnson who of course has the ladies hitting on him, making crappy comedy and taking the spotlight. I admit the fight scene is actually pretty good, but with terrible villains and the rock being in the movie more than the animals it ruins the entire movie. Interesting cameo with the ""Rampage"" arcade game being in the office of the antagonists. I don't believe this movie got the right rating either. Anyways the arcade game was wonderful, but to have all that go to waste with this movie makes me think that people will make anything for money.",Rampage

-Lev 26:22Let's be real, this is based on a pretty obscure video game. personally, I only played it once, 20 years ago, in an arcade, of an amusement park, that was being foreclosed. so I had no good expectations
video games are difficult to make with a narrative. but this game had no narrative, it was simple. so the writers actually came up with a way to building this as an actual movie on the sci-fi angle, with themes of animal-experimentations and government intervention.
So expect to see a simple movie with interesting visuals and a pretty nice opening scene as well that sets the mood quite nicely
extra points Jeffrey Dean Morgan's memorable performance",Rampage

The CGI ""monsters"" could have been interesting but they distorted them so much they were unbelievable (except George). The side characters were flat, sad stereotypes that were badly acted.

Rampage is based on a popular video game series of the same name where players can take control of giant creatures battling and avoiding government and military forces. On that note, viewers shouldn't walk into a movie theater or insert the Rampage DVD or Blu-ray disc in their player expecting to see something on the same scale of The Dark Knight or King Kong for that matter. However in terms of quality, the film surprises. The quality in action is exhilarating and the visual effects for the animals feel almost life like and contrast well with the actors on screen. The cast are enjoyable to watch with worthy performances by Naomie Harris from Pirates of the Caribbean and Jeffrey Dean Morgan from the Walking Dead. Viewers can enjoy a few laughs as well from the Rock and his buddy hood with George the white gorilla. If this movie is accepted for what it is as a video game series brought to life on the big screen, then it accomplished what it set out to be and not viewed as less worthy of a film. Rampage is simply an exciting creature flick with fun senseless mayhem and heart pounding action mainly towards the finale.

The plot is basically a ""template"" plot for monster movies. Experiment goes wrong and destruction everywhere.There's another issues in the movie. The character. Why did they introduce a character if he/she didn't crucial to the plot? There is a scene that introduce a character and I was like ""wow, a promising character"" but then I was like ""okay"". The funny thing, there's a character who didn't even get a proper introduction.

But we have a couple good well known actors the Rock who has already starred in many both cheap and expensive action style films. In addition we have Jeffrey Morgan who is famous for playing Negan in Walking Dead, and his humour is just as good in this film as it is as him acting as Negan.
There is not as much action I was expecting, but I still enjoyed what was given and the final battle is mind blowing effects.
I got the DVD (not on Blueray) and the quality of the CG I thought seemed very well done.As a cheap stand alone film I give Rampage an 8 out of 10. I thought it was funny, and I enjoyed the action and the comedy between the Rock and Jeffrey.",Rampage

I really enjoyed the 2D game when I was a kid and I was shocked they were going to make a movie out of it first off bc there really wasn't much of a plot in the game. You chose one of 2 characters, and star recking the city. They did a fine job with plot to make it have some story but the real heart is the city destruction scenes. Like out of the game you get tanks flying, buildings falling and a whole lot of squishy army men to step on. If you were expecting and oscar movie, go watch a Meryl Streep flick.

George's (the gorilla) sense of humor.
Much action (mostly at the second part)... after all that's the primary thing you ask from a movie based on a video-game.
Cons:
Scenario 1/10 (""Characters"" and ""plot"" are two words that this scenario doesn't know what they mean... some scenes are outrageous unreal).
Direction 4/10 (Peyton didn't avoid the clichés, although some action scenes are well made).
Dwayne Johnson 3/10 (But that's OK, it's Dwayne Johnson, you know what to expect).
Jeffrey Dean Morgan 2/10 (He looked like a bad immitation of Robert Downey Jr).
Naomie Harris 5/10 (She was decent, in comparison with the other actors of the cast).

405,fullmoon7461-908-439866,Worse than I thought it would be,4,23 June 2018,"And I wasn't expecting much! I saw the trailer in the cinema and thought it looked a bit dumb, but I love Dwayne Johnson, so it might be fun. Then I found out it was based on a video game, so my expectations lowered even more. It started out pretty good, with a nice twist that the evil, mad scientist/greedy corporate ""dude"" was a woman (sadly played as a one-note character!). The chemistry between Johnson and George (the big gorilla) is great, but that's about all that is good about the film. There are some cool shots of Chicago and it was nice to see a different city getting destroyed as it's always NYC, LA or San Francisco! Was really sad to see Joe Manganiello killed off at the very beginning, as I was hoping for some scenes with him and Johnson. Good time-waster for young teen boys and that's about it.",Rampage
406,disambiguator,Much Better than Expected!,8,28 April 2018,"To be honest, I wasn't really expecting much from this, but I hours later, I am still shocked by how much I enjoyed this movie...It's really just that entertaining.In all honesty, I almost could've waited for On-Demand, but it was a big-budget giant monster movie that looked pretty good (i.e. had excellent CGI) in the trailers, and it had DJ, so I decided to give it a shot. And Man, I'm glad I did! First off, this isn't your typical PG-13 movie, that has a lot of ""suggested"" violence, with few actual deaths, and almost no blood or gore. This was definitely a HARD PG-13. In fact, based on what's on the screen, I imagine they probably had to make some last-minute cuts to avoid an R rating. I really do hope we get an extended, or director's cut version.As far as the story, and characters, well DJ is DJ. Earnest and likable. The ""agent"" was ""wry"" and a ""folksy snark"", who ended up being quite likable in his own right. All the other human characters were pretty much cardboard cutouts that could have been played by almost anyone. However, the BEST character of the movie is ""George"", the signing, albino gorilla, was responsible for most of the laughs. The enjoyment/entertainment factor that the ""chemistry"" between DJ and George adds to the movie, cannot be understated. They are GOLD when they're onscreen interacting.Sure, the story is mindless, and the destruction is absurd, but, as I said before, this isn't the typical PG-13 movie like the Transformers or even the Avengers, where you really don't get a real sense of loss of human life. And I believe it was that aspect of it, that raises it above the typical popcorn movie for kids and adults, and enabled it to hold my attention for the entire running time. From the opening scene, you KNOW this is a different ""animal"" (excuse the pun).If you like monster pictures, or even just Dwayne Johnson, don't miss this one!",Rampage
407,tim3542,Exactly what it says on the tin,7,11 October 2018,"A good action movie for the whole family, Dwayne Johnson does his thing and I enjoyed this movie. Don't take life too seriously. It won't blow your mind or win any oscars but you'll enjoy the ride.",Rampage
408,impalassamuel,An unrealistic epic disaster sci-fi action thriller!,7,13 April 2018,"Rampage is one of those pictures in which the viewer has to surrender all reasoning and think creatively before making a commitment to watching it. This whopper of a motion picture contains ample fodder for the desperate moviegoer including far-fetched plot details, fast paced action sequences, multiple setting sites, just deserts, destruction & explosions, juvenile humor, guns, and just enough swearing and blood to garner a PG-13 rating.Adding to the ridiculousness is the appropriately cast Dwayne Johnson. (Why doesn't anyone call him ""The Rock"" anymore? He's not grown up enough to go by his legal name.) Once again The Rock saves the day, and the world, from complete ruin as not only his physique, but also his character's military experience enables him to: survive being knocked around, operate various military vehicles and weaponry, kick in security doors, break out of plastic handcuffs at just the right moment, escape from a crashing plane while securing parachutes on two other escapees, completely ignore the close range gunshot to his abdomen, crash land a helicopter, and keep his composure while exchanging juvenile insults in the other guy's face.I did not see any previews for this piece of work, but saw it simply for nostalgic purposes. Rampage conjured memories of the '80s when we'd take family trips to the mall in Pensacola or Mobile and Dad would give me and my two older brothers each a dollar to blow in the arcade lined with upright and seated video game consoles including Double Dragon, Punch Out, Spy Hunter, Excitebike, Dig Dug, Ikari Warriors, Operation Wolf and Rampage. Thanks to the producers for an indirect homage to those long extinct venues by including a shot of the destruction of a Dave & Buster's locale. Much like the coin operated video games of yore, Rampage is one of those pictures that movie producers use to lure shallow consumers for an easy and overpriced buck. Have fun!",Rampage
409,MooveeVu,Rampaging Disbelief,6,19 June 2018,"Hello again kiddies....here we have Dwayne (the Rock) Johnson's latest offering Rampage (and yes it is!). If Godzilla and King Kong had a baby Rampage would be it. Loosely (very) based on a video game of the same name it sees the Rock playing the Rock (again). Supposedly the thinking man's hero these days he's the ex commando fighter/deadly killer/current environmental warrior/doctor/scientist/tender lover fighting to save all humanity, his friendly chimp chum and Chicago. No small task but.....if anyone can do it Rock can?
Led by the (nowadays almost mandatory?) corporate baddies with the (nowadays almost mandatory?) female in charge, cutie gorilla George who has an excellent grasp of human verbal and sign language is transformed into a giant destroyer along with two other members of the animal fraternity.
Corporate baddies use their plan B to control the animals by calling them into downtown Chicago which, of course, results in mass destruction and loss of human life.
The (semi) romantic side story with Rock and the female doctor who invented the serum and antidote trying to retrieve said antidote and bring George back to the loving, tender, intelligent gorilla with the outstanding sense of humour we all know and love is fraught with the usual dangers and saviours. Assisted by the cowboy cop the two ""friends"" finally save the day of course. Suspension of disbelief is required in most of these movies but continuity, good editing and flow should not be on the back burner. 
Some blatant errors include someone (near fatally) shot in the thigh running around like Usain Bolt in the very next scene. Not too sure if the director just forgot about the gunshot wound or just instructed the actors to forget about it.
I'm not too sure where all the 9's and 10's have come from for this one. 
The CGI is excellent and worth the price but the rest = blaaaaah.. CGI effects are a 12/10 but acting and story line reeeeely let this one down.

The beginning was good, I guessed some twists will come but I think they had some budget issue and did not invest on the story telling part much. Even a mid-school kind can tell you better story.

I can see IMDB has 6+ rating for this movie, so I think they have multiplied their investment already but honestly I did not like the movie.

425,visforhendrix23,Rampage has too much dumb in the destruction,3,11 April 2018,"Like many kids of my generation, I spent numerous fond memories playing Rampage. Maneuvering the joystick, I commanded my monster avatars to ramshackle buildings, punch-out windows, and gobble-up helpless pedestrians. The simplicity of the destruction is where the charm was: a gorilla (with a striking resemblance to King Kong), a lizard (also with the deja vu of Godzilla, bridging copyright infringement), and a werewolf (the creator's obviously needed a filler character) ramshackled cities across the United States, evading the pursuit of military forces. After eradicating the city to rubble, you move on to the next location and start the chaos again.Unfortunately, Hollywood has a proclivity for botching button-mashers adaptations; the film version of Rampage is a joyless mess -- a disaster porn flick that lifts the Midway title and it's monsters, but showcases them in a stale vehicle primed for Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson to fill his yearly quota of blockbusters.Johnson is Davis, a primatologist that prefers the company of animals to people. Whenever possible, he shies away from social situations. Already, The Rock is renowned as the people's champion, so this characteristic is a stretch. Within a San Diego wildlife sanctuary, Davis is friends with George (a very original monkey name), an albino ape who was rescued after his parents were butchered for their hands to be turned into someone's ashtray (a direct quote from the movie, I'm not that creative.)Meanwhile, in space, a flubbed experiment causes a rat to grow exponentially and wreck the cargo bay of a space shuttle. Canisters descend to earth and crash in different locations; one is gobbled by a crocodile; another hisses into the face of a wolf; the space debris conveniently lands in George's sanctuary. The pathogen in the canisters morphs the animals into city levelling monsters. George wakes up and murders a grizzly bear, for no other reason than they frightened each other.From seemingly out-of-nowhere, Davis is joined by Kate (Naomie Harris), a disgraced genetic researcher who provides informational aid whenever the plot requires. She explains that the doomed space experiment was called CRISPR -- which sounds like a robotic McDonalds' invention that inevitably replaces human employees. The pathogen caused increased size, strength, ability, and -- most troubling -- aggression. Genetic editing combined the growth rate of a whale, speed of a cheetah... you get the idea. CRISPR rapidly changed George's DNA overnight, and he awakens with a super-monkey bod. The monkey doesn't like being cooped up while the silly humans squabble about whatever, and he goes bananas, busting out to do what the movie title implies.Pursuing the critters are the Wyden siblings, yuppies who run Energyne and want their pathogen back. The duo are obvious Trump spawn -- from their diction to their attire. They create an antenna that emits a bio-sonar frequency, an invention more appropriate for Lex Luthor's scheming in Superman IV: The Quest For Peace. The device drives the monstrosities nuts, causing them to migrate to the tower and stop the racket. The Trump kids assume the police will kill the threat and they can extract their sample. Obviously, in the durpy world of poor planning by ne'er-do-wells, it doesn't go as planned.Like other recent Warner Bros. genre offerings Kong: Skull Island and Pacific Rim: Uprising, Rampage is a stereotypical disaster movie that fails to leave much of a memorable impact. Sometimes, films are supposed to be mindless romps into escapism. But, how many times are we supposed to enjoy ourselves when precious time escapes us and is invested into such a poor movie. Leave your smarts at the door for this farfetched brawler.",Rampage

451,benc1-1,Not what I was expecting,6,22 April 2018,"It's possible that I misread the trailers m, but it seemed like this film would be more self aware about how dumb it is and would do something fun with it, so I was actually really excited for this movie. Those elements are sort of there, but for the most part it's played completely straight, so that was quite disappointing, especially since the premise is so ridiculous. The best part about it is obviously The Rock, as well as his best friend George. Their relationship really helps this movie, but unfortunately they're separated for a majority of it. Jeffrey Dean Morgan reprises his role of Neegan from The Walking Dead, but he is fun to watch when he's on screen. The monsters destroying the city is pretty cool but it's only like the last 20 minutes of the film. That's a common complaint about giant monster movies, there's not enough monster action, and I get the argument that there needs to be humans to follower else the monster stuff becomes monotonous, but there really was t enough here and the human stuff for the most part was really bland and uninteresting.The worst of it was Malin Ackerman who plays the villain of this movie. First I'll say that the writing of this movie is not great, but the villain dialogue is the worst of it. Then Malin Ackerman didn't do anything with it, she looked like whoever she was talking to had the script staples to their face and she's just reading it.The last thing I would like to point out is this movie is shockingly violent and scary. Not like genuine horror but there are several jump scares that I wasn't expecting. And this movie does not shy away from showing you all of the people being killed by these monsters. It's not graphic but it can be quite uncomfortable. Not something you would expect from a movie about giant animals with The Rock doing one liners.Overall I was pretty disappointed with this movie, but I wouldn't say it was bad. There is quite a bit of fun to be had with this movie but I would say wait until it hits Redbox or some streaming service before checking it out.",Rampage

Has the correct pace for this kind and is very well done directed, keeps you glued to screen,doesnt lose interest.
CGI is top shelf and recomend as i did, view it in 3d IMAX for you immerse even more into the titans clash battle environment.Sound is excelent,and sound track also.
Plot:is at the normal level for this kind of monster,action movie,altough i felt there was not many twists of storyline,this fact is compensated with the twists within the battles, overall it fills the common expectation for this type of movie in plot matters.The comic relief scenes are inteligent and functions well..The cast, Dwayne Jonhson and Jeffrie Dean Morgan were the saving factor , not that all others arent good, but the class level difference is huge ,i justify what made me say this, is the fact the interaction between characters didnt glued at all, at least not in effective way.Theres more conection betewen the gorilla and dwayne than all rest of cast together.
Overall a solid 7.5 rating and i give a plus 0.5 because The rock didnt disapointed, Jeff Dean Morgan backed up nice and the movie delivers what is set to do, entertain you all the way.",Rampage

The CGI is phenomenal. If you did play the video game there's plenty of references scattered throughout the city scenes.Jeffrey Dean Morgan plays a good guy who is sort of Negan lite. Dwayne Johnson and George have good onscreen chemistry.The bad guys in the movie are so completely cliched and one dimensional and that works perfectly with the script.This movie will never win awards for acting or best picture, but it wasn't meant to. If you're looking for 100 minutes of outlandish entertainment this is worth the watch.",Rampage
468,sahilelastic,"As terrible as it is, Rampage lives up to its name.",5,26 September 2018,"'Rampage' follows a primatologist named Davis Okoye who must team up with George, an albino gorilla who turns into a raging creature of enormous size as a result of a rogue experiment, to stop two other mutated animals, a gray wolf and an American crocodile, from destroying Chicago. Yes! Believe it or not, that's the synopsis.How do you rectify the difficulty of making a good video game adaptation? I think it's safe to say that this film does not answer that question. What we get here is more of the same as far as video game adaptations go. However, with its absurd plot, hilariously cringe-worthy dialogue and over-the-top action there is a recurring sense of fun to be had.Dwayne Johnson plays the character of Davis Okoye and as expected, he is left with most of the heavy-lifting and he is supported by Naomi Harris who is entrusted with explaining the unintelligent scientific mumbo-jumbo behind the ridiculous incidents happening around them. Another character with even a single ounce of personality is George, the albino gorilla whose bond with Davis is one of the few standouts of this film. As far as the rest of the cast goes, we have Jeffrey Dean Morgan who is essentially playing his Walking Dead persona, Negan, with an identical swagger. But none of the characters are as appallingly written as the villains whose half-witted scheme makes absolutely no sense and eventually we are brought to the climax which is basically set in a playground of debris somewhere in the middle of Chicago.Apart from the decent creature design of George and the crocodile, there aren't any technical aspects to rave about, which is a disappointment as it could have been a positive factor to be taken away from this film.At the end of the day, it's the charm and badass-ery of The Rock and the ludicrous set pieces that make this film watchable.",Rampage

The movie suffers mainly from a bad screenplay, at the levels of an Asylum movie, with stupid and meaningless dialogues. Obviously from a movie of this kind I did not expect (rightly) nothing, but they can be really irritating. Also ""Rampage"" does not entertain, but bores for the first hour, thanks to the horrible scenes in which the two main villians are present ( among the most terrible I've ever seen). Fortunately, after this first hour the movie has fun and it does it really well, the action scenes are excellent and the CGI is great.

When the giant wolf in the movie was revealed to be capable of flight in the same manner you'd expect from a flying squirrel, then I might've left the cinema if it wasn't for the film being close to finishing.

But hey, The rock was in it and he's the rock, like always, I though he was alright, was somewhat likeable and charismatic too and liked the bond between him and George. But every character in this film just; very bland and forgettable. Don't even get me started on the villain because why does film need a villain who just wants money and builds a satellite to attract the monsters for no reason, come on, at least the CGI was fine. The dialogue was so horrendous and rather lazy for a script, this looks like a film that was written by an 8 year old with drawings and a few sentences and thats it. The only I found fun was the last 20 minutes which was exactly what I wanted and still following a very cheesy film as it went on as well as the jokes that never landed. And let me just spoil it George wins obviously and ate the villain which made me cringe so badly how stupid it is. Overall Rampage was exactly what I thought it was gonna be, dumb, stupid, cheesy and very predictable for the most, characters look liked video game characters and rather dull, CGI was fine, The Rock was fine but I could not relate much with game with it's absurdly dumb average script with no plot at all. 3/10",Rampage

It's no doubt that it's the action and special effects that really drive this film and there are some pretty intense action sequences, not just the RAMPAGE in the last 20 minutes, which was probably the most fun I've had in a movie for a while. The chemistry between Dwayne and George is very good, although I feel it could've had a more emotional element to it. In regards to the humor, some of it landed and some didn't. Overall, If you go into this film and turn your brain off and just enjoy what it is, I think you'll have a lot of fun with it.

The effects are surprisingly well done considering we have a few giant monsters roaming the streets and destroying buildings. It's entertaining - the Rock + Jeffrey Dean Morgan cowboy relationship brings out the best in both actors, the villains are cheesy, there's very little reliance on the love interest and more of a focus on the relationship between George his friend - essentially this film is exactly what it should be.If you're a fan of Godzilla and/or Dwayne Johnson - you shouldn't be disappointed in this film.",Rampage

Johnson gives a pretty good performance while other characters are a bit cliche.The plot of the movie is simple but a bit confusing as I was never quite sure in what ways the animals were genetically modified.I would say the highlight of the film is he fight scene at the end and the humorous tone the movie takes. George the gorilla is quite funny in particular. Honestly I wasn't a fan of Jeffery Dean Morgan's character or Jake Lacy's. I think both are capable actors who may not have had a lot to work with script wise. Finally I would say that if you just want a good action movie this will do just fine.

It's hilarious, this alone worth the ticket price! My only gripe is Jake Lacy (Brett Wyden) who looks like a halfwit. His sister is cool though.Well, this movie is one big mess: Action, Monster, Terror, Destruction, etc...it's like DNA of King Kong + Jurassic Park + Godzilla mixed together = A big fun roller coaster ride....plus some lewd jokes if you don't mind.For those of you who don't like Dwayne Johnson in the first place then I don't get it why do you still wanna watch it.

Muscle bound, scarred mercenaries traveling the countryside heavily armed in military helicopters? Got it. Fat cat, evil corporate bosses willing to sacrifice any innocent life, and even mankind itself, to pursue more wealth? Got it. And that's just the beginning. This was more like an episode of Inspector Gadget than a major motion picture.

577,jshmartes,A fun popcorn movie that doesn't take itself too seriously,7,16 April 2018,"The movie is extremely entertaining and is a popcorn film, not a shakespearian tragedy, or serious film, just pure cheesy fun. And if you like that sort of thing, this movie is for you. If you want to waste your time, you can waste it with this movie. Not Pacific Rim: Uprising, this movie. This is the perfect movie to turn your brain off.Dwayne Johnson is there as always to be the badass character who is a superhero and throws cheesy one liners. He's good in the movie, my only issue is with his bond-ship with George, which I wish they put more depth with the two, more of a connection. It's just there and you have to accept it. Jeffery Dean Morgan is a scene stealer. Any scene with him, he dominates it with no trouble. It's like watching Negan if he was the good guy. The other characters are so-so, they really didn't do much in the movie.The villains are cartoony as hell. Very corny. They are a brother-sister dynamic duo, but they play off as one who is the serious and the other one who is the meekly little sibling. Their motivations are hilarious and so over the top, but by far they are definitely the weakest element of the film.The monsters themselves are amazing, especially George who is a character himself in the movie. He provides some good, but crude humor such as giving the finger to the Rock. So my readers who are parents, if you have a child that doesn't understand what the middle finger means, make sure to tell them what it is so that they won't do it. Back to the Monsters, the wolf, Ralph is a scene stealer whenever he shows up, by far he is underrated compared to George and Lizzie the croc. Which we're going to talk about now, Lizzie is a beast, certainly a Godzilla monster for the third act. She is terrifying and her arrival scene is monster movie galore. Their designs are amazing and they were utilized correctly.Are there good characters in the movie? No, there is not a single good character, expect for Jeffery Dean Morgan's character, Russell, who oozes coolness whenever he's around. This movie is not an Oscar contender, and it isn't trying to be. The characters may not be great, but at least they're serviceable, unlike Kong: Skull Island, that tries to be a campy film, but the problem from that movie is that the characters are awful and only two of them are interesting. Rampage had a good balance with okay characters and great monster action, which is good if you want to have a good monster movie that doesn't take itself seriously. The only monster movie that I can take seriously due to its subject matter is Godzilla, which its story should be treated seriously and not cheesy like the earlier Godzilla films. Which reminds me, this movie is like Kong vs Godzilla in the ending.To conclude, Rampage is not a great movie, but it is a fun movie if you are into monster action, Dwayne Johnson badass-ness, and overall an entertaining movie. The visual effects are great, the story is ridiculously cheesy, and the score is a little generic.I was entertained by this movie, I knew what I was going in for, and I hope you do the same when you see it.I'm giving Rampage a 7 out of 10.",Rampage

579,CALSR-IMDb,Yes!!!!,9,25 April 2018,"On first seeing the trailer for this film I wasn't excited, I was intrigied. I couldn't quite see how brad peyton (director) could make this work. Well, he did!. I had my worries as the opening scene involves a huge mutant rat causing havoc in outer space as a government experiment goes horribly wrong, but I was quickly won over with the brotherhood relationship of Davis (Dwayne Johnson) who plays and ex special forces turned poacher hunter, and his extraordinarily clever silver back gorilla George, who he rescued from a young age.The film is one hell of a ride and does not give you time to catch your breathe. Insane fight scenes to keep you griping to your arm rests throughout.Dwayne Johnson is cast superbly for this role as I believe he is the only actor out there I could imagine going toe to toe shooting a grenade launcher into the mouth of a 200ft alligator, whilst being helped by his giant fury primate friend. Kate coldwell (Naomie Harris) jumps on the scene as the ride along to help save the day, being a discredited engineer of the deadly experiment from the beginning she is the only one who can help piece together how to stop world catastrophe.As destruction makes its way all across North America time is running out for Davies and Kate. They have to embark on what can only be seen as a suicidal mission to get to Chicago to find a serum to end the onslaught of the beasts the have fallen infected and have grown to a monumental state.

596,james-freel,"Flawed, but still a fun romp.",7,29 April 2018,"Where to begin with Rampage. Yes it's flawed, you could sit all day and find fault with it, from the acting which ranges from wooden to completely over the top, to the script which is absolutely horrendous, so cliched it's painfully cringeworthy at times. Yet somehow it gets away with it all, due in no small measure to Dwayne the ""Rock"" Johnson. Straight out of the Stallone/Schwarzenegger school of acting and like the aforementioned an immense screen presence, totally wooden but hugely enjoyable he carries the movie on his obviously large shoulders. 
The film also features two of the worst over the top screen villains ever seen, coming across like a couple of hammy characters from the sixties Batman T.V. show, all facial expression and pantomime like. Then we have the totally one dimensional Jeffery Dean Morgan (portraying his character as Negan from Walking Dead as in everything he does) as our mean government agent out to thwart our hero and his criminally underused sidekick Naomie Harris who becomes nothing more than a stooge for Johnson to bounce off throughout.
On the plus side however, the opening scene of the film is excellent with its Alien like backstory setting up the ongoing plot. CGI is top notch as are the action scenes when our three monsters go on the rampage across Chicago. George the Albino Gorilla and the flying Wolf (Johnson delivers the best line of the movie with his deadpan response to this discovery) are the main protagonists with the Crocodile/Alligator like Naomie Harris a mere support act. The relationship between Johnson and George is
quite amusing if somewhat ridiculous throughout. As is our leading mans ability to survive all manner of life threatening situations and emerge intact with little more than a scratch at the end of it all.
If it's a critically acclaimed award winning movie you're after then I'm afraid Rampage isn't for you, If on the other hand you're just looking for a couple of hours of popcorn fun action then give Rampage a go. You will enjoy it despite yourself.",Rampage

I would've liked just Rampage fighting because every SINGLE WEAPON was conviently placed for Dwayne to use. It was insane. Never did they also realize how many people were dying. I didn't even understand the villains. What was their point. Neither did I understand the officer who wanted a hamster. It was a messy script.

The acting was nothing special and very very average and maybe the only reason that I saw this movie is because of Dwayne Johnson like the rest of the world .

620,lclievens,"Not bad, nor great",6,21 April 2018,"I watched the movie in the cinema. I found the storyline very entertaining, even though i feel like the main character, played by Dwayne Johnson, was unhumanly strong in this movie. He survived countless deaththreatening situations and ultimately I found that disturbingly unrealistic. For example, during the plane crash he gets hit by a heavy metal object, which would definately kill a normal human being, but he isn't even knocked out. Also being able to easily kick in a door from a lab that is most likely very well protcted and locked seems pretty unrealistic. The e(extremely rich) bad guys had a lot of sensitive information laying around there, it doesn't make sense they wouldn't properly protect it.The huge mutated monsterlike animals were very well animated, I especially loved the wolf. I also like how they killed a bunch off characters in the beginning, to show the seriousness off the situation. 
My final remark is that Dwayne Johnson didn't shine in this movie. I think that this specific personality doesn't fit him and frankly his acting wasn't very good. I understand that it is extremely hard to pretend you're talking to a greenscreen the entire time and it makes sense that he didn't perform as good as usual.",Rampage

If you love The Rock, you will really enjoy this movie as DJ absolutely captured the feel of Davis Okoye. The special effects were really good and legit. I have no trouble believing that this is the best-reviewed video game movie of all time, but I don't agree with it as Lara Croft with Alicia Vikander was better at least to me. The supporting cast was also very good, especially Naomie Harris and Jeffrey Dean Morgan. Overall, I recommend this movie to all Rampage and The Rock fans, because Brad Peyton really did this film justice. However, the screenplay and the script could have been better.",Rampage

It's fun and visually it's actually pretty well done. It's got its fair share of lines that I found to be corny but just an overall fun movie.

The movie wasn't slow. And the CGI wasn't bad. I see a lot of negative comments about the movie, and most were there before the movie was even in theaters. If you are a fan of the game, it's probably worth checking this one out. Definitely one of the better video-game to movie translations I've seen.",Rampage
624,TonySheets09,A somewhat enjoyable cop out.,5,18 April 2018,"Let's begin.
Rampage starts with an intriguing opening sequence but cheesy. The fact that the film has to have a love for George shows where we are today in cinema and the economy. Everyone knows this film is based off of the video game of the same name. In the video game, you play 1 of the 3 monsters and the objective is too destroy as much of the city as possible. But in the film you are meant to love George(the gorilla). One huge aspect about the film that I have a problem with is, how come Ralph(the wolf) and Lizzie(the crocodile) both get physically altered, and their appearance change, but George stayed the same. This to me is just a cop out to still love George. Another cop out is the ending. I honestly would've preferred what they were going to do and how the film was going, but then, boom, cop out. With that being said, the ending could also be a good thing because through-out the film, we build and feel this emotional connection with George and feel for him. So really it goes on preference. Other than the nit picks I have, the CGI was very well done, the action was intense, and most of the characters are likable. There is one scene with Ralph that was fantastic in my mind. Well done, suspense and very chilling way to introduce Ralph. Lizzie didn't get a huge introduction till third act, but Lizzie was a badass. The story itself is generic but enjoyable. All in all, the film is an enjoyable action fun fest with cheesy moments and acting. Seeing it on the big screen is a plus as well. Not great but a fun film to check out.",Rampage

638,somaiyasomu,Thundering emotional action film,9,17 September 2020,"Dwayne Johnson the rock is one of my most favorite wrestler and actor. I personally have seen most of his movies. His one of the movie Rampage released on 2018. The movies main character is a rare albino gorilla.
The gorilla's name is George, and he lives in a San Diego wildlife preserve, under the care of impossibly buff bachelor Davis Okoye which role is played by Dwayne Johnson. As far as unlikelihood goes, city-destroying monsters have nothing on The Rock playing a primatologist, even one who came to Jane Goodall's calling through special-ops work. But maybe a movie with this much breathless pseudoscience demands a properly improbable pseudoscientist. Davis has forged a wisecracking, cross-species bromance with his simian companion, who he rescued from poachers years earlier and whose fluency in sign language makes Koko look like a total dunce. George, in other words, is a pretty remarkable ape even before he gets into a lost canister of gene-splicing pathogen and grows to the size of a small building. He's also, to be honest, kind of a dick-a prankster whose habit of scaring the bejesus out of green interns for his own amusement sets the sadistic tone.
The movie is directed by Brad Peyton. The script written by four people, teams Davis with a bitter rogue scientist named Naomie Harris, who was looking faintly embarrassed. Also a smarmy federal agent played by Jeffrey Dean Morgan, seriously just doing a friendlier version of Negan, his congenial-bastard villain from The Walking Dead.
The main character George, whose growth spurt comes with blinding rage, is the least of the gang's problems. They also have to contend with the ravenous flying wolf that emerges from a radioactive blast crater in Montana, and the reptilian leviathan growing out of a bubbling gene pool in the Everglades. As per my review I liked this twist most.
At beginning like always movie goes smooth but it takes a twist when the mutant fuel literally drops out of the sky, raining down from the fiery remains of an orbiting laboratory.
A question may arise on mind: Why would a company conduct its research in space? The reason is, because no one could see what you're doing up there!
The evil corporation, who are the responsible for all problem is Energyne. Which is run by a pair of cartoon sibling moguls includes: Malin Akerman and Jake Lacy, abysmally bad in thankless rolesas per my concent.

My only concern was that this film would take itself too seriously or put too much focus on the human drama, but thankfully it doesn't outstay its welcome. I forgot this was inspired by the arcade game for the simple fact the game was inspired by creature feature horror movies to start with. The wolf was the most entertaining monster seeing him tossing tanks around like dog toys in Chicago. If you squint really hard its difficult to not compare the cheesy dialog and visuals to cutscenes from Command and Conquer Red Alert. Just makes it more fun and stupid at the same time.",Rampage

Naomis Harris is wasted and the bad guys are straight out of underdeveloped and cliched central casting (the beautiful but ruthless woman and the witless cowardly man). When the basis of a movie is a largely forgettable 1980s arcade game, you don't have a lot to go with, and with that limitation in mind, it was an admirable effort. Solid visuals and plenty of stuff being destroyed is important for this genre so Rampage delivers there.

With that in mind, if you have thoroughly enjoyed this movie, hear me out & understand why I did not. In all actuality, this movie as pretty decent based on its 50% Rotten Tomato rating that when I decided to experience it. The storyline was standard in terms of average crazed scientifically experimented animals. There weren't too many ways in which the plot could have deviated and blew our minds; which is completely understandable. For its plot, I thought it was a pretty good film. Moreover, the trailer really depicted the film's intensity, concept and experience. So if the trailer was appealing to you, then it's suggested that you experience it. However, there were a lot of areas that really did ""get me going"" or interested in watching the remainder of the film. The jokes did not land with most viewers. Unfortunately, the comedic timing wasn't in sync with the film. The roles, lines and expressions were expected. But who I am to tear this piece to shreds. All in all, it was an okay experience.

695,psnrm,"Overdone meets Half-baked (""been there, done that"" over and over)",3,13 April 2018,"For one thing, it was a return to '80s movies where profanity was often used to try to grab people's attention when the story was getting weak. Repetitive curse words show a lack of creativity; they're not witty or amusing and they add nothing to the entertainment value of a movie. But aside from that, it was the same old King Kong-Godzilla-Jurassic World-mutant-monster-threatens-to-destroy-an-entire-densely-populated-city movie theme. And yet the person or persons who threaten to inflict the most damage on society are the trigger-happy government/military personnel who abuse the authority conferred upon them to shoot first and ask questions later. (My! but that never gets old, does it?) One exception though is that this gorilla can communicate pubescent profanity in sign language, which makes him a ginormous ape with the ""potty mouth"" of a 14-year-old boy. Wow, that's something short of amazing or even a little bit interesting. The trailers were fun; the movie? Well, not so much. It was highly predictable all the way through and then they drug the end out to be as absolutely sensational as could be and in so doing, they made it just intensely corny, mind-numbing, and tiresome. It's hard not to be entertained by Dwayne Johnson but this was not a standout work of his either. He played the role he was hired to play and he did his part well, but the role itself was 'meh'. They basically cast him as a regular guy in a super hero's body or vice versa. I think I may have chuckled lightly twice during the movie so that was a little bit fun, but mostly, I was just happy when it was over. Oh... (psst) and none of my grandkids (ages 7-12) liked it either.Kind of fun fact: Dwayne Johnson's character's name is Davis, but the ape knows him by his sign language name, ""Rock."" :)",Rampage

This movie had one of the most simplest story, but the implication was perceptive and worth thinking. It was mind-blowing fun. The actions and the big scenes were breathtaking.

Honestly, I went to go see this movie not expecting much, i was very bored and just wanted something to do. I was sitting at the edge of my seat the whole time. Brad Peyton brought us terrifying monsters and one sweet albino gorilla struggling with a horrible mutation that cause each animal that comes in contact with it to grow and gain special abilities. Its very entertaining, but, as all movies do, there are a couple of moments that weren't so good. A couple of lazy writing moments, but who cares, Dwayne Johnson is fighting monsters and flying helicopters! Rampage is based off of an arcade game in 1986. I think that it properly payed homage to the game by putting an arcade machine of Rampage in the back of a scene with Jake Lacy and Malin Ackerman. The end of the film was good and bad at the same time. My heart warming, viewer side of me loved that George survived, but my realistic, critic side of me is left wondering how it will be possible that the government won't try to kill or take George. That could leave room for a sequel, though. Either way it is an enjoyable, fun movie! I was left laughing and anxiety filled. The wolf scene was by far the scariest scene in the movie. If you're looking to watch a fun film with your family I'd definitely recommend it!",Rampage
715,Tastybanana96,Goof,7,7 August 2018,Davis and Dr.Kate were thinking how to give George the cure from lab. They placed the cure in Claire's purse but actually they didn't have to because she already had 2 in there since Dr. Kate gave her them back in lab.,Rampage

718,dekif,Nothing New Here,3,11 December 2018,"There is actualy not a single thing in this movie that makes it unforgetable. I've just watched it and i can't even remember everything. Another typical The Rock movie where he is just a humble guy doing everything right. Cheese, cliche, corny, cringey. Everyone that is thinking of paying to watch this should stop doing it and just forget the tought. Watch it on the internet if you have spare time, altough i believe you deffinitely should spend it some other way. Bond between the Gorilla and James (or idk) was poorly developed. We actualy learned more about the Gorilla than the main character. Side girl was badly introduced, and I don't even want to start on the villains. Felt like i was watching a disney channel movie. ONE THING that saved this pile of repetative shit is the secret agency guy (altough he also was very cringey). People that rate this 10/10 and are calling this thing realistic are just low IQ people that don't think with their heads appearently. All in all this was exactly what I thought it was going to be, just a bunch of stupid goofy stuff we all saw bilion times already. Not the worst of the worsts but deffinitely one of them. 1/5",Rampage
719,steelershane,Not much to see here,3,10 January 2019,"The trailers didn't do much to provide interest for me here and despite reservations about the film, I gave in to the ability to see The Rock do some impossible stunts on a free weekend of HBO. The movie reminded me of San Andreas in that the action scenes are as ridiculous as you could imagine, including a damaged helicopter riding a falling building and huge animals destroying large city skylines. The Rock actually provides a little bit of humor and some heart in his interactions with George, the albino gorilla. Unfortunately, the charm of the gorilla-human interaction is much more compelling than any of the human counterparts.Characters are introduced and dismissed fairly quickly with several characters only existing to provide a punchline and to develop The Rock's interest in animals over humans. Jeffrey Dean Morgan makes an appearance as Harvey Russell, but his existence in the film is not all that necessary and he has some excruciatingly horrid scenes. The human villains are over-the-top and almost embarrassing to watch. This is especially the case with Jake Lacy. Others are barely introduced and only are there to show the ferocity of the wolf.The effects are not as bad as you might think considering what actually happens. If I told you that a gorilla, a wolf, and a crocodile run rampant through the city and destroy everything in their path, some of it on top of a building, then you would expect it to be a CGI disaster, but it kinda works in a weird way.The movie had some promise even though the premise isn't much. If it focused more on the relationship between Dwayne Johnson and George, or actually invested in the human characters, there may have been a quality product somewhere in there. Unfortunately the movie spirals into parody-like scenes in most of the final sequence. Overall, this feels like a subpar effort to mesh San Andreas and any monster movie, and it doesn't produce much more than a watchable mess.It's worth watching if you're doing something else while it's on, but there's not much to see here. Definitely do not pay to see this.",Rampage
