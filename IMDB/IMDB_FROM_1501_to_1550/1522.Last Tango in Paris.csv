0,TheLittleSongbird,"Controversial perhaps, but also touching and beautiful psychodrama/study of a broken, tortured man",10,23 February 2011,"My favourite Bertolucci film along with The Last Emperor, Last Tango in Paris is something truly remarkable. It is controversial yes in how sex was displayed on screen. But it is also beautiful and touching not just as a psychodrama but also a study of a broken and tortured man. Instead of erotic, to me it came across as more existential, and I had nothing against that, in fact I wouldn't have minded whether it was erotic or existential or neither.Last Tango is beautifully shot, with artful cinematography, interesting lighting and stunning production values. Gato Barbieri's jazz score is marvellous and creates a suitably delirious atmosphere. The story is a beautifully written and emotional one, the script is of exceptional quality and Bertolucci's direction is of high calibre. The acting from the two leads is superb. It is a real shame Maria Schneider died as young as she died, she showed great promise, and here she was sexy and touching and she looked stunning too. For me, the best asset of Last Tango in Paris was the performance of Marlon Brando. He is both wonderful and devastating in the lead and shows quite a lot of range in this film, one minute he is ferocious and vulgar, next he is tender and full of pathos.All in all, wonderful film and worth seeing for Brando's performance especially, amongst other things. 10/10 Bethany Cox",Last Tango in Paris
1,bkoganbing,Marlon's Last Hurrah,3,12 April 2008,"The Last Tango In Paris did not reach American shores until two years after it was shot in France. So for two years the American public was spared Marlon Brando's dip into porn.I have to say I'm at an absolute loss why this film is so well regarded. Purportedly director Bernardo Bertolucci was dealing with middle aged loneliness without sex. But that subject was handled so much better from the woman's point of view in Tennessee Williams, The Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone. And a middle aged Vivien Leigh looked better than a middle aged Brando.Brando plays an American expatriate whose wife commits suicide rather suddenly or better I should say without any warning signs that he noted. My guess would be she was sick and tired of this self involved lug. So Marlon takes up with young Maris Schneider and makes it clear all he wants is good sex and completely at his whim.This dopey girl actually goes for that even though she's engaged to young film maker Jean Pierre Leaud. I can tell you if I had a choice I'd have taken Leaud in a microsecond.All this is an excuse for Marlon and Maria especially Maria to parade around in various states of undress and say a lot of naughty words in two languages. Why this film got all the acclaim it did, I cannot fathom.Some might consider it art, I consider it pretentious.",Last Tango in Paris
2,SnoopyStyle,Best with Brando as the animalistic brute,8,7 February 2014,"Jeanne (Maria Schneider) is looking at renting a Paris apartment, when she gets surprised by Paul (Marlon Brando) lurking in the dark. They have uncontrollable sex without giving even their names. In fact, he refuses to allow names to be exchanged. She has a demanding filmmaker boyfriend who is constantly filming everything. Paul is a man suffering from the suicide of his wife. They find solace and escape with each other in this apartment.This starts with so much shock and awe. Their first encounter is absolutely electric. Whenever Brando is that animalistic brute, the movie gets very fascinating. Whenever the movie slows down, it meanders at times. Director Bernardo Bertolucci has produced a long movie at around 130 minutes. It could easily be trimmed to keep the tension high. As for the ending, it's rather disappointing to have Jeanne shot Paul. It feels like a cop out. As for the sexual content, it was probably very shocking at the time, and may have broken down some taboos. The sexual content is equivalent to today's more risqué but no longer shocking.",Last Tango in Paris
3,Hitchcoc,It's About the Power of Angst,9,4 April 2006,"This is a train wreck movie. It's about forces moving all over the place with no commitment and no love. Is it lust or is it physical release. Where is Brando in all this. There is a Camus like existential element at work all the way through here. Brando's character is so full of anger and pain that he gets his release in a sexual encounter (or a series if you will), based on anonymity and violence. He can't love again. There is a gray color to everything. Brando uses that incredible face of his to express his hurt. Every ounce of energy that an actor can put into a role is left in this one. Like many great films, there are no pat answers as the credits come up. The slice of life we have seen is sickening to us and we feel a little unclean. The fatalistic essence of having nothing to lose is as loud as the screams we hear, echoing the European train engines. I think that this was the first film I saw where I thought I was looking at a portrait. Some friends talked me into going to it because they had heard about ""those scenes."" I soon realized that there was so much more to this film than the sexually explicitness. I saw it again several years later. It has not tamed down in that time.",Last Tango in Paris
4,gavin6942,Brando in a Very Odd Way,6,26 July 2017,"A young Parisian woman meets a middle-aged American businessman (Marlon Brando) who demands their clandestine relationship be based only on sex.Marlon Brando has some standout roles. Most notably, as Don Corleone in ""The Godfather"". Is this one of them? Well, it may be his most disturbing role, and that includes ""Apocalypse Now"" where he was an actual cannibal.Now, I can totally understand the concept of a man wanting his mistress to be merely his mistress, no strings attached. That makes sense. But Brando's character in this film is not just a guy having a fling... he is possessive, violent and grossly lecherous. This is a terrifying character.",Last Tango in Paris
5,lee_eisenberg,"Maria Schneider, RIP",10,24 March 2011,"I had never heard of Maria Schneider until she died of cancer last month, so I decided to watch her most famous movie. Bernardo Bertolucci's ""Ultimo tango a Parigi"" (""Last Tango in Paris"" in English) has got to be one of the most intense movies ever made. How to describe it? Superficially about a stormy affair between a young French woman (Schneider) and a middle-aged American widower (Marlon Brando), it seems to me that the movie depicts a clash between 1960s idealism and 1970s cynicism. The affair has nothing to do with love: it's as if these individuals exist independently of everything, not even telling each other anything about themselves.While the setting is Paris, this isn't the romantic city that so many movies have idealized. The French capital comes across as a bastion of bleakness. Marlon Brando himself looks pretty disheveled. Overall, there might be no truly sufficient way to describe the movie, except to say that I do recommend it. Also starring Jean-Pierre Léaud, Maria Michi, Catherine Allégret, Catherine Breillat, Massimo Girotti, Veronica Lazar and Darling Légitimus.",Last Tango in Paris
6,jboothmillard,Last Tango in Paris,8,13 October 2011,"From Oscar and Golden Globe nominated director Bernardo Bertolucci (The Conformist, 1900, The Last Emperor), I definitely remember seeing maybe a minute of two of a scene from this much mentioned film with the star of The Godfather, and I very much looked forward to seeing it. Basically middle-aged Paul (Oscar and BAFTA nominated Marlon Brando) is the American grief stricken, crazed widower who has spent aged roaming the streets of Paris since his wife recently committed suicide, until he sees young and engaged French girl Jeanne (Maria Schneider). She is looking for an apartment, and after finding it he manages to convince her to let him share it with her, and not long after beginning this agreement they begin a seedy but passionate affair, only without telling each other their names. The affair does create more tension in their personal lives, with Paul struggling more to come to terms with the death of his wife, and Jeane trying to prepare to marry her film director fiancé Tom (Jean-Pierre Léaud), who is making a documentary about her. In one instance of the affair Paul brutally rapes Jeanne anally, using only butter for lubrication, but instead of running away he stays where the crime happened, and he also makes arrangements for his wife's funeral. Eventually Paul has become dissatisfied with ""possessing"" Jeanne, but he continues to try and get any kind of passion from her, but she knows her marriage to her fiancé, dull though he is, means more to her, and shockingly Jeanne shoots Paul dead in the end. Also starring Massimo Girotti as Marcel, Maria Michi as Rosa's Mother, Giovanna Galletti as Prostitute, Catherine Allégret as Catherine and Darling Légitimus as Concierge. Brando gives a fantastic performance as the man disturbed by the tragedy in his life, but also by his aggressive passion towards the young girl living with him, Schneider also gives a good performance as his innocent flatmate seeking some kind of excitement, together their scenes both have sexual chemistry and of course create the controversy that surrounded its release in cinemas, it is certainly a drama to be seen. It was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Drama. Very good!",Last Tango in Paris
7,ccthemovieman-1,Call It What It Is,2,16 May 2006,"This controversial film probably still shocks most people today. That's how crude the dialog is in here, and that's hard to do considering what has been heard on film the past 30-plus years.Some of the things that Marlon Brando says to Maria Schneider are downright disgusting. The profanity here goes way beyond acceptability, and I'm used to hearing about anything and am offended by only a couple of words. But this is just ""pushing the envelope"" gratuitously and nothing else.Story-wise, this is a total bore. Nothing happens for over two hours! The only thing that kept me watching was Schneider's looks and Bernardo Betolucci's cinematography. However, there's just so much sleaze one can take. Anyone who gives this movie a favorable review has to be morally bankrupt. Only a Liberal would try to intellectualize and rationalize out-and-out soft porn.",Last Tango in Paris
8,moonspinner55,"""I might be able to comprehend the universe...but I'll never discover the truth about you.""",6,18 March 2017,"Young Parisian woman, cast by her innocuous fiancé in a film he's making about love, has an intermittent clandestine affair with a 45-year-old American widower whom she met when they both went to check out an empty apartment; he initiates the sexual relationship with her on the basis they keep it anonymous--but truths are eventually revealed. Although prurient viewers have since picked up on the film's more sensational aspects, ""Tango"" is a serious movie about sex and subservience that features one of Marlon Brando's finest performances. Angry and raw and belligerent, Brando's Paul is grieving the suicide of his wife while lashing out at the world. His sexual and psychological dominance over life-loving Maria Schneider can be interpreted in many different ways and, indeed, the picture has been dissected and debated by moviegoers since its debut (director Bernardo Bertolucci has even stirred up some recent controversy by saying he may have violated 19-year-old Schneider's trust while filming). Not an easy picture to like--but almost impossible to dismiss--the film has been overrated by some yet is occasionally powerful and sensual, and beautifully photographed in hazy afternoon colors by Vittorio Storaro. **1/2 from ****",Last Tango in Paris
9,Quinoa1984,"Mysterious, provocative, masterful",10,24 April 2001,"Bernardo Bertolucci's best film Last Tango in Paris is a film that is possibly the only X rated art film, unless you count out Midnight Cowboy and Clockwork Orange (I wouldn't).  It is a movie where even if you might know some of the cliches invented in the film (get the butter, for example), it is still thought provoking.Marlon Brando, who is undoubtedly an excellent actor, shows off his stuff here and is so good it can be argued if he deserved the Oscar for the Godfather or this because both performances are extraordinary.  He plays a man who's wife had just commited suicide and decides to have a sexual binging in Paris with a young girl.  The encounters aren't a prostitutional type of thing, but rather a weird escape for the two of them from they're lives (which is what they need).Some might say the movie has aged with time and that the film's sexuality might have depleted.  Unless you are watching this film along side Black Throat, this film will seem like Porn (even if it's a tad mild), for both generations.  But if you can take it (the butter scene, for example, is actually more disturbing than sexually exciting), it makes the movie all the more better.  Featuring classic scenes, with a classic actor, a classic director, and a classic motion picture.  A++",Last Tango in Paris
10,tavm,Last Tango in Paris is partly pretentiously dull for me,5,17 June 2007,"After so many years of reading or hearing about this X-rated non-porn movie starring Marlon Brando and directed by Bernardo Bertolucci, I finally rented Last Tango in Paris thinking I'd watch a great masterpiece of a combination of two genius talents. What I saw was a bit pretentious bordering on dull art-house movie that seemed to grow repetitious after a while with Maria Schneider's character alternately rejecting and then accepting Brando's often violent and forceful sexual advances. While there were a few funny scenes that involved wordplay like the ""grunts instead of names"" scene between the leads or the marriage proposal between Schneider and her fiancé director Tom, they weren't enough to make Brando's constant using of certain words any less irritating as the picture went on. After the famous butter scene that I watched with clenched teeth, I thought the worst was over. Then Paul makes Jeanne cut a couple of her nails so she can stab her fingers in his butt! It's at this point that I really wished she had left him once and for all. There were some other things I liked such as the jazzy score, Paul's conversation with the man who had an affair with his late wife, and the tango dance of various couples even when Paul basically mooned everyone there. Maybe if I were to see this again I'd give this one a bigger rating. For now I'm giving a mixed review of 5.",Last Tango in Paris
11,ComedyFan2010,A masterpiece that you might not want to watch again,8,25 January 2014,"This is not necessarily a movie that is a joy to watch or is very entertaining and yet it is a masterpiece. How so? because it is all about showing discomfort and abuse of the characters and while it is not pleasant to watch, it is hard to look away and it is made perfectly.The story is about a man going through emotionally painful time and a young woman having trouble with her fiancé. They meet and start an anonymous affair, but then feelings start to arise.Back in the 70's the movie started a lot of controversy. And while sexual scenes are not as uncommon as they used to be, the movie is not outdated in this sense. The sex is not about being erotic. It is meant to cause the viewer some discomfort and it still does, just like the famous butter scene that is pretty much a rape.The movie is mainly about Brando's character Paul. We see his inner struggle and the more is revealed about him the more we see him. He is hurt by his previous relationship and struggles with the fact that his wife killed herself and he never really knew her. He hides from those feelings in the anonymous affair. But his wish for happiness dives him into believing Jeanne actually has feelings for him and there is a future. Unfortunately her ""love"" seems to be just a fascination with his dominant masculinity and mystery. Once he opens himself all of it starts to vanish including her feelings and she refuses him as well as kills him. No here is the one thing which makes me take off 2 points for the movie, otherwise I would give it perfect. While it is understandable that Jeanne mistook the fascination by anonymity for love and her feelings end once she gets to know him, we never see a turning point. It seems a bit too much that she even runs away from him. There is something missing there.Acting is great. Marlon Brando is at his best, we feel his struggle and the way he brings his monologues are great. Marie Schneider is perfect for the role. She has the innocence of that young woman, new to love, not yet able to understand what Paul goes through and also very confused with her own feelings. Also liked Maria Michi as Rose's mother. Really felt for her character in the few scenes that she appeared.",Last Tango in Paris
12,michaelRokeefe,LAST TANGO is a masterpiece!,8,3 October 2006,"Written and directed by Bernardo Bertolucci, LAST TANGO is a twisted love story with passionate forceful sex and sadomasochism. I first saw this movie at an X rated theater in Tulsa, where I also watched A CLOCKWORK ORANGE. Marlon Brando is excellent as a troubled American in Paris that enters a sordid relationship with a young Parisian woman(Maria Schneider)less than half his age. He is trying to overcome his wife's horrific suicide. This short, intense and extremely steamy clandestine affair is based on sex and sex alone; with a rule of not mentioning names or past history. The insults, humiliation and taunting finally brings the young woman to a turning point; at a time when she momentarily thought she was actually in love with the decrepit and pathetic man, who raped and violated her. She finally puts a definite end to the relationship with excusable afterthought.Brando turns in one of his finest and powerful performances. Schneider is absolutely mesmerizing. Many kudos to Bertolucci for his straight forward braveness knowing the raw and sordid sex scenes would be highly controversial.",Last Tango in Paris
13,sunwarrior13,Marlon's Last Great Film In A Leading Role,10,17 February 2015,"Last Tango In Paris could probably be considered as Marlon Brando's last great film in a leading role in his storied acting career before he just started accepting supporting roles in his subsequent movies.In Bernardo Bertolucci's art-house classic,Marlon delivers one of his best performances that would be comparable to that of Vito Corleone in The Godfather as a plays Paul,a depressed American who came to Paris after his estranged wife committed suicide.He meets a young French woman named Jeanne,portrayed by Maria Schneider and they both enter into a sadomasochistic and carnal sexual relationship with her.They neither share personal information with each other.But things just get messy and complicated as both want to get more from their relationship which results in a peculiar conclusion in the end.This was definitely a controversial film when it was first released theatrically as it contains sex scenes and emotional portrayal that were considered raw and graphic.But nevertheless,it contains cinematic poetry that one would still appreciate at present while this review is being written.As I have said previously,Marlon provides a terrific performance as a sexually passionate and pained individual.As a whole,the movie also contains great ideas about sex and eroticism.",Last Tango in Paris
14,zardoz-13,"Knocking the Briefs Off ""Brief Encounter""",2,13 March 2005,"""Last Tango In Paris"" stirred up a firestorm of controversy when United Artists released it back in 1972. Over thirty eventful years have passed since it weathered a battle over its alleged obscenity, but Bernardo Bertolucci's acclaimed erotic classic hasn't aged well at all. In fact, ""Last Tango"" should have been renamed ""Last Tedium In Pretentiousness."" Okay, ace lenser Vittorio Storaro deserves top marks for his moody, evocative photography, but the rest of this muddled nonsense is just that: NONSENSE! Perhaps we can forgive Bernardo for this dreary, depressing, drivel. Overrated in every department aside from its cinematography, ""Last Tango"" doesn't even seem erotic now, even if it ever were. I saw this crap when it came out and it seemed like an exercise in random hopelessness. Brando is a great actor, but not here as a person for whom we have not the least sympathy much less understanding. By the time that we meet him we learn that his wife committed suicide in the tub and splashed blood everywhere. So all we know is that he is grief-stricken beyond the point of no return. The idea of making a movie about two lonely people who connect for sex at a neutral locale and deny themselves the faintest pleasure in terms of knowing who they are screwing looks like something Bernardo came up with while sitting in a 42nd Street grindhouse. I wouldn't even describe this epic as obscene. Sure, sexy Maria Schneider flaunts full frontage nudity, but the sex scenes are so tame that you'll want to yawn and roll over. They rank right down there with the sex scenes between Jack Nicholson and Jessica Lange in the remake of ""The Postman Always Rings Twice."" Anybody who calls ""Last Tango"" obscene hasn't been to a movie in thirty years. Even when I originally watched it in obscure movie theater in Starkville, Mississippi near MSU, I detested the obligatory scenes involving her boyfriend Tom (Jean-Pierre Leaud) as the filmmaker who follows Schneider as the focus for a documentary that he is producing. They say that the original cut of ""Last Tango"" ran 4 hours and they chopped half of that out, so why didn't they axe this useless subplot? The Schneider character is just as one-dimensional as the Brando character, except that we know that she can shoot her father's pistol with accuracy. Indeed, Bernardo does everything that he can to make Paris look like a hovel. Shrinks will probably love this movie as well as pretentious art critics who love to fawn over films that make no sense and in making no sense justify senselessness. Oh, yes, the Gato Barbieri sax solos ooze atmosphere in what boils down to ramped up sexual variation on ""Brief Encounter."" Happily, Bernardo made better movies before ""Last Tango,"" and he made better movies after ""Last Tango.""",Last Tango in Paris
15,evanston_dad,A Lousy Tango,2,14 April 2006,"A listless, pretentious film that meanders on for way too long and is redeemed only by Marlon Brando's tremendous lead performance, perhaps the best he's ever given on screen.Maria Schneider is a blank slate at best, both the actress and the character she plays. Her animal ruttings with Brando are supposed to be shocking and titillating, or at least were meant to shock and titillate a 1972 audience, but they seem now like desperate attempts to give the audience something that will engage its collective interest. It really is astounding that such a pointless movie could have such a wonderful performance in it, and for Brando alone this film is worth watching. But as for the rest, consider yourself warned.Movies like ""Last Tango in Paris"" are the reason why so many people hate international cinema.Grade: D",Last Tango in Paris
16,zetes,My favorite film.,10,18 July 1999,"This is my single favorite film. There has never been a film that has given me more to think about that this one.But first let me clear one thing up: this was NEVER MEANT TO BE A LOVE STORY BETWEEN TWO GAY MEN EVER. I really despise when people say that. Why should people believe what someone said in the liner notes for the soundtrack? According to the British Film Institute Classics series, Bertolucci thought of the idea after he had a strong desire to make love to an anonymous woman in a room he had never been in before. That rumor arose when Ingmar Bergman said that the film only would work if Paul and Jean were both men. But why? Paul walks the line between two separate attitdes towards Jean: at some points he wants to torture her. he wants to punish her and all women. On the more positive side, he wants to teach her about life. Both of these attitudes stem from his wife's betrayals and lies. He wants to punish and get revenge for what Rose did to him, but he also wants to prevent Jean from becoming like her. Both of these attitudes are extremely egotistical (Jean does call him an egoist). How would those attitudes even apply if Paul were sleeping with a man? It would be a completely different film. It may have been good also, but it would not work with the plot and themes of the film.Now that that's over with, I would like to praise brando, my god, for a while. This is his ultimate performance. He improvised a lot of his scenes. The scene where he talks to Rose's dead body is possibly the best scene in all of film. He actually felt the emotions he portrayed. He seemed to feel them more intensely than a person could possibly feel.
I would also like to praise Maria Schneider and Jean-Pierre Leaud. Many people have complained that Maria Schneider is just standing there while Brando acts circles around her. This isn't true. They also complain that her character has no character. She's just meant to be naked and beautiful. The only reason people say this is that Jean hides her emotions a lot. Where Paul is looking at their relationship from a grave viewpoint, Jean sees it,initially, at least, as an adventure. She entirely accepts Paul's advances when they first meet. She comes back for more. She's sexually independent (she proves this by masturbating when he pays no attention to her), where Paul is wrapped up in the confusion he feels after his wife's suicide. I love the little games she plays with Tom, her fiancee. ""La marriage pop"" is one of my favorite scenes. Leaud's character is really funny. It's a joke targeting the cineasts who gave him his career, Truffaut and Godard. His love for film is humorous, and gives us the excellent contrast between great fimmakers like Bertolucci and adequate ones like Godard.Art isn't about fun. It is more wonderful when it is emotionally painful, as the Bacon paintings introducing the film exhibit spectacularly. I absolutely love dancing with Paul and Jean. Sometimes, when I watch it, I'll rewind the Last Tango scene and watch it four or five times. The dialogue is among the best ever written. And I am probably the only person who thinks the ending is perfect. I will not reveal it, but it simply illustrates that Jean was not willing to learn adulthood. Childhood was much more fitting. Kind of reminds me of most every other movie.",Last Tango in Paris
17,christopher-underwood,"Maria Schneider does well to keep up in English, French and broken English",8,8 February 2019,"The film stunned me when I saw it in the cinema some 45 years ago and I'm not sure I have braved it since unless I watched some murky video. So much has happened in cinema since that first viewing that it is no longer quite so shocking but still packs a punch. Beautifully shot, there are lovely shots of Paris and the light upon the walls of the apartment but there is ugliness too and there is never a moment one can relax confident that all will be well. Brando is brilliant, if slightly awkward and Maria Schneider does well to keep up in English, French and broken English. As the two mismatched individuals merge together into some sort of passionate but loveless relationship we learn something of the background. Essentially, Brando is bereft following the suicide of his wife, right at the start and Schneider has a much more conventional, if barely believable one with an aspiring film maker. He is played by Jean-Pierre Leaud, he star of many New Wave films, particularly for Godard and Truffault and it would seem that Bertolucci is having a little fun here pitting the pretty boy of trendy 60s cinema against the old brawler Brando (I understand though that Leaud was so intimidated by the American giant that he could not work alongside him). I noticed this time that the soundtrack I have always loved seems to begin and finish rather abruptly at certain points of the film and it seems I may have found the reason. Apparently there is, or was, a four hour rough cut of the film and that it was this that Gato Barbieri studied in order to decide where the film required music. Seems reasonable, therefore, to suppose that when the film was cut by almost a half, the music may no longer slip so unobtrusively in and out.",Last Tango in Paris

20,StevePulaski,Why dance solo when it takes two to tango?,8,13 March 2016,"NOTE: This film was recommended to me by Joseph Garza Medina for ""Steve Pulaski Sees It."" He is a middle-aged landlord from American in the middle of mourning the suicide of his wife. She is a young Parisian woman engaged and ready to begin her life with someone whom she deeply loves. She meets him when she's looking for an apartment to rent. An illicit, anonymous sexual relationship ensues.Both agree not to give one another their names. Perhaps that way it is sexier. For a man to sleep with a woman and not even know her name, he might be looked at by his peers as something of a true player, whereas for a woman to admit she slept with a man whose name she doesn't know would leave a permanent brand on her character by society. This is one of the many reasons they don't tell anyone. That way the arousal of the actions remain and neither party is greatly harmed anymore than they will inevitably be.He is played by Marlon Brando, one of the finest method actors who has ever lived, who is nothing shy of greatness here. Though he is largely quiet throughout the film, his leering presence as a character speaks volumes. His sexual force and energy does too, as he is the one to frequently initiate sex with her so that the two can release the tension, passion, and unmatched desires that have been clawing at their being for so long. She is played by Maria Schneider, another wonderful character actress who establishes herself here nicely, as well.Both characters are just minimalist enough where intentions and such can be applied to them with ease. The writing team are careful to craft recognizable characters that also have a strong element of impressionism here that can help discern both characters' intentions. For one, we can assume that he's sudden promiscuity with sex is a way to mask the pain of his late wife. The burden of pain is so strong and uncompromising for him that the only way to at least temporarily remedy it is through carnal acts that would be meaningless if they weren't so full of passion. For her, one can assume her youth and her adventurousness are leading causes of this act of promiscuity, but perhaps it is also a need to feel in a world that doesn't always want you to display your emotions.The film shows what happens when emotions and passion become so overpowering to the human mind that the only logical thing to do is to act instead of talk or define feelings. It elegantly showcases what comes of two people who completely collapse under the weight of their own impulsive desire to have sex and the problems it sets up for the future, when the clothes are back on and the weight of reality returns in an even more burdening manner. Even through cloudy aesthetics, intimate and erotic sex scenes, lavish costumes, and a wonderful, classical score that intertwines different jazz and full-blown orchestra, the characters and their underlying motivations remain the most interesting dance in the film.

21,MovieAddict2016,Lost in Translation.,9,17 December 2005,"Bernardo Bertoluci's ""Last Tango in Paris"" is a beautiful art-house movie that features one of Marlon Brando's finest performances.

However, they do not reveal anything about themselves and the relationship is based solely on sex.Jeanne is engaged to Tom, a film director making a documentary of sorts about her. She questions her own love for Tom as she finds herself more and more drawn to Paul.""Last Tango in Paris"" or ""Ultimo tango a Parigi"" was released in 1972 to much hoopla.

22,lasttimeisaw,"Bertolucci's self-fulfilling, exotic and provocative sexual fantasy",8,2 August 2016,"For a man, what could be more personally satisfying than overpowering his perfect object of desire solely by his sexual prowess? That's the scenario in Bertolucci's self-fulfilling, exotic and provocative LAST TANGO IN Paris, telling based on his own sexual fantasies, a privilege which has been a substantial stimulus to encourage generations of youngsters to become a filmmaker, but only those very few in the top tier can achieve that gratification with momentum and flourishes, even Bertolucci couldn't get away with lambaste and the film has been perpetually on the list of films that shock the world!Jeanne (Schneider), a 20-year-old parisienne, comes across a near-rape sexual intercourse with a middle-aged American expatriate Paul (Brando) in an empty apartment which is available for rent. Downright to her own volition, she comes back to the apartment (now rented by Paul) again and again, to partake in the act of love, and even unabashedly falls in love with him, that's the utmost elixir to boost a man's ego (Bertolucci does know how to patronizing heterosexual males). Paul forbids themselves from revealing each other's names, and claims that he doesn't want to know any concrete information about her, and vice versa. ""Everything outside this apartment means nothing to us"" So, who is Paul outside that apartment?We see a grief-ridden man, wanders around in bereavement after his wife committed suicide, which hits him like a severe jolt, therefore, he is in the limbo of mourning, questioning, self- doubting and resentment, he and her wife run a low-rent hotel in Paris, they had been married for 5 years, and in the end of the day, he has to face the music that he has never been able to understand her, he can even host a pleasant conversation on the face value with her wife's lover Marcel (a down-to-earth Girotti and still gets his appeal in his 50s), a lodger in their hotel. So, meaningless no-strings-attached sex becomes his go-to option to assuage his discombobulated state, once Jeanne is hooked. who is so naively impressionable and totally loses herself in the mysterious halo of ""it's beautiful without knowing anything"", the sex becomes an addiction, a ritual gratifies the needs of both. Out of the apartment, Jeanne has a filmmaker boyfriend Tom (a customarily neurotic Léaud), who is shooting a documentary about her, and will propose to her later in the film.Is actress Maria Schneider being exploited in her career-making/typecasting role? Who admittedly confessed her ill-treated experience of shooting this film. Let's take a step back from a feminist POV, and perceive the film in a plain angle of egalitarianism, the lascivious fetish of Schneider's sultry body presented in constant nakedness has never been balanced out by Brando's (supposedly) unsightly figure in all his frankness (maybe, Bertolucci simply cannot pay the sum to convince Brando to reveal some of his sagging skin), not to mention the unsolicited sodomy scene (which has forever ruined butter for me), Schneider was completely taken by surprise, on that front, Bertolucci is exploitative, sinister, sadistic and misogynist.However, simply disregarding all the behind-the-camera trivia (which is not an easy task and sometimes involuntarily infuses some preconceived sentiment into one's subjective judgement), and taking a forensic look into the film per se, in its claustrophobic, ill-lit interior shots, what Bertolucci achieves with the sinuously fluid movement of his camera is something masterfully seductive, voyeuristic, intimate and thought-provoking, two total strangers, unburdened from formality and luxuriate in their primal libido and form a rather wholesome rapport devoid of any negativity associated with reality - that's everyone's unsaid fantasy, but in sheer perception, Bertolucci also shows that such purity can be fragilely sullied by the world outside, literally outside that apartment, where, in the third act, when Paul moves out, and then flippantly courts Jeanne on the street, in the tango bar, how foolish he is when he becomes love-struck, the magical potion doesn't work in broad daylight, where Jeanne will ultimately realise Paul is no more than another nettlesome suitor, only much older, and at her age, he is far from a premium worth her time and effort while the world is her oyster, something menacing looms in the offing in the hard-pressed eagerness, there will be no happy ending out of it. It serves as a poignant elegy for these out-of- depth sad sacks like him, and a wake-up call for those young creatures like her.Brando sinks in his role exceedingly in conveying Paul's frame-of-mind, initially in his unapologetic-ally threatening and unfathomable mode, remarkably eases into his varied facets: cantankerous mood-swing, tender reminiscence and vulnerability, notably during his show- stopping monologue in front of his flowers-adorned deceased wife, only before long, he will make a fool of himself. Schneider instills a more unaffected, also cruder impression with a susceptible inclination for servitude either confronted by masculinity or whetted by novelty, a common mistake for starters.As its graphic depiction of (perverse) sex act loses its taboo in a more liberal present world, Bertolucci's controversial pièce de résistance might get a more impartial reappraisal by focusing on its accumulative evocation of inexplicable human feelings rather than on its politically incorrect modus operandi borne out of some bold but insensitive considerations, or perhaps, it is just my wishful thinking, plus notoriety always sells the tickets.",Last Tango in Paris
23,sol-kay,This is the title shot baby! Were going all the way!,7,30 July 2006,"***SPOILERS*** Having recently lost his wife who ended up slashing her wrists Paul,Marlon Brando, wanderers the streets of Paris looking for a reason to live and continue his empty and shattered life. We see as soon as the movie begins Paul and Jeanna, Maria Schneider, pass each other in the street barley noticing or giving themselves a second glance. The two later meet at this apartment house and agree to share the same room with Paul obviously using his sonority,he's 45 and Jeanna is 20, laying down the law on how things were to be done in his and Jeanna's pad; no names no addresses no references and no past. That's the way thing are to be between the two with Paul doing all the thinking for both of them.The movie ""Last Tango in Paris"" goes from the ridicules to the sublime in some of the scenes with Paul.In the movie Paul comes with some of the most unbelievably and hysterically corny and off-color jokes that would, if he's allowed to say them on TV, cause viewers by the hundreds to crack up laughing or go into immediate cardiac arrest. Paul is, or thinks he is, also very knowledgeable in what makes people tick and think with his deep penetrating and thought-provoking insights on the human condition and how people are far more complicated then the human mind can ever imagine or conjure up. Like as if nobody ever thought of that before. Paul's mindless revelations about life and death and everything in between seems at times to go way over the barley out of her teens Jeanna's head.Getting a very reluctant Jeanna to participate in a number of shocking and degrading sex acts with him Paul then treats her like dirt because she did them which makes the confused, but under Paul's control, Jeanna want to participate in them even more! This later makes her feel as if she was brutally raped by the crazy but manipulative Paul instead of just having mutual and consensual, but bazaar, sexual relations with him. This gross atrocity afflicted by Paul on Jeanna goes on for more then half the movie.It's then that Jeanna finally wakes up to Paul's sick previsions and tries to leave him for her, hyped-up and somewhat not too bright, boyfriend Tom, Jean-Pierre Leaud. Tom's a half-a** armature movie director who's trying to make Jeanna into a star in his next big production a film that he's making for a public access Paris TV channel.We later see how devastated Paul was over his late wife Rosa's suicide when he's at the, what I first thought was a funeral home, flophouse of a hotel where she's lying in state. Pauls emotional outburst of insults at Rosa for leaving him alone in the world and at the same time him begging her for forgiveness was so emotionally explosive and at the same time strangely touching that it left you like Paul almost totally exhausted of every human feeling that's still left in your body.With Jeanna leaving him Paul now tries to becomes a bit more human to her trying to treat Jeanna like a woman not a piece of meat as he tries to rekindle their relationship. At one point Paul has her willing to go back to him as he takes her out for an evening of dancing in a dance contest at a Paris Tango Hall. Getting drunk on both glasses of champaign and shots of R&B whiskey Paul makes a complete fool of himself dragging Jeanna, by her legs, around the dance floor and together with Jeanna getting kicked out of the place. Paul among other things moons of the entire dance-hall to the absolute shock of a number of elderly couples in attendance who almost fainted. With this last crazy and stupid act on Paul's part to win her back there's nothing in the world now left for Jeanna to come back to Paul for!Still wild and crazy about Jeanna, despite her wanting to have nothing to do with him, Paul chases her through the streets of Paris in broad daylight with hundreds of Parisians looking on in shock and horror until he finally corners Jeanna in her mother's apartment. In a last act of desperation Jeanna pulls out a gun, her late legionnaire father's revolver, and blows the crazy and insane lunatic away and out of her life once in for all.Even though Paul was a dangerous and crazy nut case you still could forgive him for his actions since he wasn't really himself and needed professional help which, sorry to say, he was very reluctant to get. The death of his wife Rosa caused him to have a complete mental breakdown that Paul tried to hide with his screwy and bird-brain philosophy that really, even though it could at times impress you, didn't make any sense at all. A broken man in both mind and body Paul was headed straight for either disaster or a mental institution and didn't really seem to care what happened to him. It was his selfish attempt to take sweet naive and innocent, not in the fact of her being a virgin, Jeanna along with him on his uncontrollable road to total destruction that made his acts unforgivable and earned him the fate that he eventually got at the conclusion of the film.",Last Tango in Paris
24,ElMaruecan82,Human's basic instincts elevated to an unreachable art-form ...,10,29 April 2013,"""Last Tango in Paris"" challenges the rawest emotions with such a sincere authenticity that any intellectual attempt to reach its meaning is futile and useless  without diminishing its own merit, it's a film that reconciles the most unlikely comparable foreign directors : Ingmar Bergman and Federico Fellini.Like in Fellini's movies, ""Last Tango in Paris"" carries the solemn and cynical decadence of a world that lost the inner humanity of pure lust behind walls of superficiality and dehumanizing conventions, the film resonates as a cry for help to get out of an unbearable hell through a thirst for joy, cries, sadness, madness, motions and emotions. And like Bergman, the film consists on many introspective shot where we contemplate the devastation devouring one man's soul. And with Brando, no need for words, what he feels, says, expresses, through words, noises, groans, through the most tender insignificant gestures to a brutal scene of sodomy  it's ""Cries, Angers and Whispers"" within one single performance  perhaps, the greatest of his career, that fittingly closes the arc of greatness started with ""A Streetcar Named Desire"", 20 years earlier.And Brando as Paul might even look like an older version of his iconic debut.And like in ""Streetcar"", Brando insufflates the film's vital force through the agony of his soul. He lost his faith on the world, his wife just committed suicide on atrocious circumstances, he runs a sordid flophouse in Passy, an upper class area of Paris,the opening shot of Brando even betray that a part of himself already died. Like a zombie-like figure, he haunts the halls of the flophouse, probably waiting for deliverance,for a last chance of survival. In those tragic circumstances, he meets Jeanne, a 20-year Bohemian-like Parisian, with a body exuding a luscious maturity, while her cheeks and child-like face suggest some remaining ounces of innocence. They exchange a few words, he stares at her like with a lusty hunger, she observes this wolf of a man, obviously hypnotized. Brando is the quiet strength, confident on his manhood, finally gets on her prey, kisses her, she kisses him backprecisely, because she's still innocent and curious enough to taste the dangerous fruit.And then starts the romance  probably the most ambiguous, controversial and passionate of cinema's history. I invite anyone who finds one of today's romances unconventional to check ""Last Tango in Paris"" and revise his opinion. The film is renowned for having been banned in many countries, it was a scandal at the time, drawing a sort of thin line between sex and rape. But the film isn't about sex, sex is only a physical communication between with two lost souls who meet regularly in the same place, like the only area where their names, identities don't matter. Together, they embody the most intimate and desperate passions of our hearts, sex for the sake it, forgetting all the social conventions, only exposing one through naked love and devotion to one another. The scandal caused by Bertolucci wasn't gratuitous, but revealing our most restrained temptations.I guess most detractors would hide their skepticism behind the shield of empathy, feeling sorry for the poor and innocent Jeanne, used by Paul as a sex toy. But how can anyone doubt that she's also part of these sordid games, that the emotions are not feigned, they are true when it's pain, as much as pleasure, and that both can coexist as one whole feeling. Paul uses the dirtiest language to test her love, talking of 'eating vomit' 'sticking tongues ', yet it remains true to life. It awakens our wildest feelings, fears and fantasies. Only Brando could have put all his weight in such an extraordinary performance, of a man fed up with life's smallest conventions. In this exhaustive journey, we follow him until the scene where he delivers a poignant farewell to the wife who cheated on him, he can't stand the false eye lashes, the make-up, he starts insulting her, but ultimately cracks up, reduced to tears and agony of a motherless child. The man is lost, and is about to drown, his romance with Jeanne becomes more ambiguous, does he want her to save himself from drowning or to drown with her, with a desperate energy? While we follow Paul in his everyday life, of what's left from it, we also get more insights on Jeanne's life, she's the daughter of a deceased colonel, she's fiancé with a wannabe director played by François Truffaut's protégé Jean-Pierre Léaud, constantly filming her. Léaud's performance is deliberately over-the-top for he sees life as an eternal movie, translating every change as a plot device, he overacts, over-talks, he's the total opposition of Brando who doesn't say much, but speak statements on life in one blink, of infinite proportions, and acts according to his thoughts, to his instincts. That's what differentiate between the two men but it's this truth that might scare Jeanne, and maybe this is why ""Last tango in Paris"" shocks and drain so much defiance. We don't want to know people like Paul in real lifeIt's eloquent that the last shot consist on Jeanne inventing a story, she consents to the very world of lies Paul refused to bow to  Marlon Brando's Paul might be the ultimate romantic movie character. And the direction from Bertolucci's, the use of pastel colors made of yellowish, brown tones, foreshadows the fate of the antihero as a man whose passion don't belong to this world, and come to the twilight, a vanishing breed, so typical of the 70's antiheroes, to which Paul remains one of the most fascinating examples.But ""Last Tango in Paris"" uses this parenthesis to enlighten us about our own condition, feeling for Paul and Jeanne, instead of condemning their acts, is recognizing the very part of humanity that hasn't been desensitized by social conventions, it's quite ironic that the most bestial reactions of human happen to be the most human.",Last Tango in Paris
25,paul2001sw-1,Vast Mango in Aris!,6,2 April 2004,"Bernando Bertolucci's film, 'Last Tango in Paris', was originally famous for its graphic description of anal sex.  Although still unpleasant, such portrayals are less rare now than then.  But in other ways too, the film still seems modern, with its multi-layered structure and post-modern self awareness (one of the subplots of the film involves some of the characters making their own film, and about themselves).  This dialogue is daringly quatra-lingual: it varies between native English, native French, French English and American French (as its two protagonists, Marlon Brando and Maria Schneider, talk to each other alternately in their two languages). Brando was still pretty then, and Bertolucci spends a lot of time just letting the light fall onto his face in different ways, a technique revisited by Coppola in 'Apocalypse Now'.But for all this, I am not so sure that this is a good film.  Neither main character is very sympathetic, Brando a self-obsessed bully, while Schneider's mannequin-like qualities certainly date the film (as does the ugly jazzy score, which is not ineffective per se but which continually grates on the ear). The film as a whole is also self-obsessed, Brando has an interesting back story but the film concentrates on the sexual and frankly I just didn't care enough about their games.  'Last Tango in Paris' remains a challenging film, but its basic idea - that our true selves are laid bare in the sexual act - is (true or not) not really that cinematic.  Worth watching, but not very much fun.",Last Tango in Paris

29,tomgillespie2002,Will no doubt inspire extreme reactions from both ends of the spectrum,8,28 September 2015,"Now immortalised as one of cinema's all-time greatest lines, American expatriate Paul's demand for his one-off lover Jeanne to ""go, get the butter,"" has since defined Last Tango in Paris. It's legacy is not it's quality, but in it's gratuitous sex scenes, which are shocking even by today's standards and were the cause of a huge scandal in its day. The scene in which Marlon Brando's character has rough anal sex with the young, wide-eyed Maria Schneider is all that seems to be discussed about the film, even by people who have yet to see it. It's reputation overshadows what is an occasionally tender, thought-provoking, and admittedly ridiculous film, that strives to depict a different kind of love story, and one that manifests itself through violence, animalistic desire, and sheer loneliness.Paul and Jeanne are two wandering souls in Paris. Paul runs a flea- pit hotel following the suicide of his wife, who we come to learn was sleeping with another man, seemingly with Paul's approval. Jeanne is on the cusp of marrying an aspiring film director in the Jean-Luc Godard mould, Tom (Jeanne-Piere Leaud), who arrives in Paris to shoot an avant garde piece called Portrait of a Woman. They encounter each other by chance when they both view an apartment up for rent. Their brief meeting results in sex, and afterwards Paul insists that it become a regular meeting place, where the two meet to forget about the world outside and exist solely for each other's pleasure. They are not to even tell each other their name, let alone anything about their family, history or their life in the real world.Originally intended by director Bernardo Bertolucci to focus on the sexual relationship between two males, Last Tango in Paris is a not a film simply about a dirty old man and his sexually curious mistress, but raises questions about morality, love and death. Paul and Jeanne are two lost souls channelling their worldly problems into sexual pleasure (or perhaps vice versa), but they find it difficult to ignore their emotions as the two begin to slowly learn more about each other. The Brando of 1972 still retained some of his handsomeness (rather than the shadow of his former self he became), and here demands your attention with every improvised line or burst of energy. It's also extremely brooding, intensified by Brando and only intermittently cheered up by the presence of Leaud, and it is long. It's just shy of being a great film, but will no doubt inspire extreme reactions from both ends of the spectrum by anyone who happens to view it.",Last Tango in Paris
30,filipemanuelneto,"Disturbing, ugly and paradoxical, it finds power on the ugly side of sex.",1,18 December 2016,"This film, basically and to approach in a simple way, revolves around a man and a woman who, while remaining anonymous, maintain sexual encounters that end up developing dramatically to the point of rupture. He is a widower and suffers with it, she is engaged but she have doubts that become more intense as their involvement increases. He seems to love her and despise her at the same time. She submits herself, accepts to be treated as a desired object, but this becomes more and more insufficient. That anthological scene of anal rape can be the most shocking and disgusting moment of the film. Subjects such as the middle age crisis, widowhood, sexual taboos, remorse, psychological traumas, betrayal, abuse over another, are all approached more or less intensely.The two main actors, Marlon Brando and Maria Schneider, achieved stardom and have made here (mainly she) one of their most acclaimed cinematographic works. However, they are not particularly grateful to Bernardo Bertolucci, as they were also strongly stigmatized by the intense controversy surrounding the film. Personally, I understand the feelings of the actors, but I am the first to consider that it was an act of courage, folly and enormous talent to accept such roles.The cinematography is beautiful, fits perfectly into the mood of the film, which rotates between the seductive, the forbidden and the menacing. Eroticism and psychological violence unite their hands in this film, provocative, disturbing and horrendous in equal parts. Sex was not only an intimate act, but an act of mastery of one individual over another, a psychological refuge and a hope for something more, that never comes.For me, this movie is paradoxical. It was beautifully filmed and done, but it tackles themes and issues that are ugly in my opinion. Bernardo Bertolucci is one of the directors I least appreciate. Not because he's bad, but because I have always found him cruel and sick. Moreover, a good part of Italian cinema has this problem: it is cruel, it is ugly, it likes to talk and to show ugly things that repugn us. This movie is a movie I do not like, but it is powerful, it's impossible to be indifferent to it.",Last Tango in Paris

32,RodrigAndrisan,"Great inspiring film, great story and acting",10,24 April 2016,"I just saw for the first time, Marlon Brando's film, The Wild One(1953). Contrary to other voices, for me, this film has not grown old well, it is totally outdated in all respects (except to Lee Marvin's personal quest in a small role). Not the same can be said about Last Tango in Paris (1972), with the same Marlon Brando but, under another direction and involved in a totally different story. Yes, in my opinion, Brando's greatest role is not Don Vito Corleone in Coppola's The Grandfather, neither Colonel Walter E. Kurtz in Apocalypse Now, by the same Coppola. Brando's greatest roles are Paul, in Last Tango in Paris, and Grindl, in Candy(1968), directed by Christian Marquand. Directed and written by Bernardo Bertolucci, another giant of the world's cinema(not only Italian...)(together with Fellini, Antonioni, Sergio Leone, Vittorio De Sica, Pasolini, Rossellini and Visconti), Last Tango in Paris is a real masterpiece. Out of neo-realism, where everybody was seeking answers to life's problems, Bertolucci manages to speak credibly, with images, words and music(Gato Barbieri), about the human condition itself. In my opinion, what Rossellini began with films like Rome, Open City (1945), Paisan (1946), Stromboli (1950), Europe '51 (1952), Bertolucci manages to fulfill with Last Tango in Paris. The Italian neo-realism is fully and successfully transplanted in the French Nouvelle Vague.

One of them was Last Tango in Paris which was notorious for earning an X rating in America and has an infamous anal sex scene. But Last Tango in Paris is a nihilistic piece which is offers nothing in themes. Last Tango in Paris is blessed with some top acting, particularly from Marlon Brando who does a great job as the lead character, playing a complete scumbag. The film does have a deliberately old fashion, film noir style with the framing of its shots and use of camera movement, including a well done scene in silhouette. But on the whole Last Tango in Paris is a film that does not offer much in themes despite the pretences to be art house, having very long and drawn dialogue scenes and during the course of the film I was wondering why was a young woman like Jeanette (Maria Schneider) was drawn to a middle aged man like Paul (Brando) at all.

34,strong-122-478885,Care To Dance!?,3,11 July 2014,"One. Two. Cha-Cha-Cha.Amongst all of the controversial films that were produced in the 1970s (and there were plenty), Last Tango In Paris (or LTIP, for short) ranks right up there at #1. There can certainly be no denying this film's controversy.As far as mainstream films go, this Italian import did everything that it possibly could to break down the barriers of what was acceptable and what wasn't in the realm of a film's sexual content. At full-throttle, LTIP deliberately toes the thin line between what is considered porn and what isn't.Even though this film's impact has mellowed significantly with age, I suggest that you watch LTIP and be the judge of this one for yourself.LTIP's story is probably about as shallow as any story could ever get. It's so shallow, in fact, that it nearly chokes the viewer with its sheer mindlessness. But, hey, let's face it, LTIP's story is inconsequential. It's the sex that we're all here to watch. Right? So, the story be damned.LTIP's story (what there is of one) concerns the tragic ""no questions asked"" sexual liaison that transpires between a naive, young, French woman and a middle-aged, American lech, who demands that the 2 of them remain as anonymous with each other as possible. To achieve this end they both solemnly agree to not share any personal information about themselves, including not revealing their real names.Some people say that Brando's performance as ""Paul"" was one of his very finest.Personally, I saw Brando's ""Paul"" as just a simple revising of his Stanley Kowalski character in A Streetcar Named Desire from some 22 years back. And, with that being the case, I'm sorry, but BRANDO looking like a totally dishevelled slob at 52 and playing a lech in LTIP wasn't anywhere near to the same thing as a young, virile-looking BRANDO, at 30, in a strategically torn t-shirt, playing a totally despicable slob.... Nope. It wasn't the same thing, at all.Below are 2 LTIP trivia notes - 1 - Marlon Brando, being the impossible, little ""Method"" actor that he was, refused to memorize his lines for his part. Instead, he placed little cue cards all around the set to remind himself of what to say, and so forth. (spare me) As you can well-imagine, this cue card business of Brando's literally drove director Bernardo Bertolucci crazy, trying as he could to make sure that none of these stupid, little cards (sticking out everywhere) remained visible in his film's final product.2 - Years after LTIP's release, actress Maria Schneider came out of the closet, or wherever, to say that playing ""Jeanne"" was the absolute, most humiliating experience, as an actress, that she had ever had to endure.Maria claimed that certain sex scenes, particularly the simulated anal-rape scene, were not in the script and that it was Brando and Bertolucci who plainly coerced her into doing these scenes, with Brando repeatedly reassuring her - ""Maria. Don't worry. It's only a movie.""Schneider said that the tears she cried during the buttery-buggering scene were very real, indeed - They were the tears of a person who had been both deeply humiliated and betrayed, big time.So, darling, save the last dance for me!",Last Tango in Paris
35,runamokprods,What a difference 40 years makes.,8,13 April 2014,"When I saw this as a teen, it just seemed pretentious and stagy, using sex to justify a lot of blow-hard dialogue and images about the sadness of life, and the emptiness of art. Now, older than Brando was when he made the film, much of that still seems true, but almost doesn't matter compared to the brilliance and depth of Brando's performance as a man trying to put the pain of his wife's suicide behind him by having a nameless, sexually adventurous fling with a much younger woman. I've also come to feel that Bertolucci was – at times – making fun of his own style as a film-maker (Jean-Pierre Leaud as Maria Schneider's more age appropriate boyfriend plays a somewhat vacuous wanna be auteur trying to capture life on film). And that at least some of the eye-rollingly pretentious dialogue is supposed to be just that – it represents Brando trying to hide from the deeper more simple and painful truths of his empty existence behind sweeping proclamations of philosophy. Not everything works for me even now, but I certainly understand why people are still watching and discussing it 40 years later.

Yes, I am sure that this is what Bernardo Bertolucci was aiming for, so he was dead-on. I didn't remember Maria Schneider being so young, even though that's an important point. She was very beautiful, and her casual European nudity was the only really attractive point of the whole film. A commenter ""Qangor"" a few comments down, analyzes this film in depth, and I agree with at least ninety percent of what he or she says. I can't really add much more. While this supposed to be a cinematic landmark, I'm not at all sure that it has any lasting value.",Last Tango in Paris
37,Nazi_Fighter_David,Bertolucci's film shocked many of those who had seen it...,9,23 September 2005,"It was, in short, a film about sex and the way that human beings use sex as a refuge, a release, and a weapon The frank dialog, the nudity, and the simulated sex were not gratuitously employed but were integral to the theme of the film, and if the picture was not totally successful, it was certainly unforgettable Marlon Brando appears as a middle-aged Americanbut not the kind of American in Paris glorified by either George Gershwin or Ernest Hemingway... This is a man tormented by inner conflict... Brando's Paul between self-hatred over his wife's suicide and his feelings for Maria Schneider's Jeanne, she between her adoring documentary filmmaker fiancé (based wittily on Godard) and the taboo-breaking Paul...The stark, empty flat that is the lovers' retreat from conventional society, and the cold, windy pavement where Paul screams his loathing for the world against the din of a passing trainconnects us with the mood of the film... Eager to escape the oppressive walls of his dark life, Paul embarks on a very complete sexual experience with a willing young woman in which there is no history spoken, no promises of future liaisons, no ties of any kind with the outside... The two lovers know nothing of each other, not even their names... Their affair is purely physical, and the barren apartment becomes, as Bertolucci intended, a world of debauchery on which is explored a catalog of behavior that seems more childish than kinky...Jeanne is a child-woman... She asks what she should call Paul, and they proceed to give themselves names brought only out of grunts, growls and screeches... Paul's cruelty is not justified and perhaps this is what attracts the modish girl... Some scenes emotionally are so provocative that you experience a wide range of feelings... Paul never asks Jeanne a direct question, but is constantly framing her for his next experiment, besides he assaults her, humiliates her and pushes her over the edge... There is one great moment for the heroine when she refuses Paul's power play and is equally unimpressed by his new declarations of love... She insists: 'It's over!' The film is beautifully shot... The cinematography is unique, somber, shadowy and painterly... It presents despair, and the music reinforce the despairing mood... The movie is also intensely erotic, intensely realistic, immensely disturbing... The extreme frankness makes faintly uncomfortable viewing, not only because of its sexual material but because of its exploration of our inner nature with true perspective... Hopefully, younger viewers can turn their minds back to a time when sex was mysterious and beautiful; dangerous and daring; not just easy and transitory... Sex nearly always implies intimacy, but doesn't always provide it... 'Last Tango in Paris' is one of the great explorations of cinema's visual possibilities Bertolucci camera's movements throughout the film characterize the rights steps of the tango which the two main characters execute at the climax of the film... We feel swept away by the beauty of the tango despite the tragic quality of the acts and events it escorts... The film does prove Bertolucci to be a true filmmaker capable of the audacity of Jean-Luc Godard and the distinctive style of Ingmar Bergman...",Last Tango in Paris
38,dwpollar,Remarkable movie about obsession...,7,18 September 2012,"1st watched 9/16/2012 -- 7 out of 10(Dir-Bernardo Bertolucci): Remarkable movie about obsession, dealing with life, love and how to cope when things don't go the way things are planned. This movie was released with major controversy because a big American star dared to be a part of a European-type movie that presents sexuality and embeds it into real life(which Americans can't handle so they call it Pornography). This movie was called this, but it definitely is not. It's really about a man trying to cope with his wife's suicide and not knowing how to -- gets obsessed with an young actress and embarks on a don't tell/don't talk relationship that starts as a fling but eventually Paul, played by Marlon Brando, wants more. Brando is excellent as the at-odds middle-aged man, and Maria Schneider does her part as the young & pretty obsession. Bernardo Bertolucci's direction is sometimes suspect as the movie doesn't flow that well, and appears to have been pasted together a piece at a time-- but the characters envelop you enough to keep you interested. A longer movie with more information about the characters would have, in my opinion, made the movie better. What we get is more of a puzzle that you have to piece together which has some merit because it makes you think after the movie is over. The change of pace ending throws you for a loop at first, as the protective Paul, reveals everything to his lover but gets an unexpected result, which I won't disclose. Bertolucci is dead-on when it comes to guarded individuals and this is a great portrayal of people in this position for whatever reason. He covers both the male and female sides equally well and creates again another compelling motion picture.(watched 129 minute version)",Last Tango in Paris
39,onepotato2,Not last enough,1,16 April 2008,"Bertolucci's controversial film is not aging well, playing like a catalog of 70s excess. Self-indulgent Method acting, check! Inscrutable wandering as plot? check. Impromptu camera-work with poor lighting? yes. Brando plays his usual sociopath in this unerotic, character study. All you have to do as a viewer to test whether a movie that involves transgressive sex is titillating or art is to swap out the hot girl and imagine it with a dowdy, homely chick. if you don't want to watch that movie, you like this because it turns you on. Ditto for Mulholland Drive and others. Then you can be artistically honest yourself. And I'd appreciate that.I'm not a big fan of Bertolucci but I approach every movie with an open mind. I like that this is pushing very hard on the previously inviolable limits of conventional film-making but I just don't like it as a whole (or in parts). Watching it is as spirtually draining as spending two hours in a nursing home. It felt like my brain was turning to mush. I don't mind that the movie was quite serious, but it also occupies a very off-putting, morose, self-important space. Context is the only way I can appreciate it. But who knows, I used to dislike Blowup, and now it ranks pretty highly.",Last Tango in Paris
40,Movie-ManDan,Cinema's Finest Erotic Film.,10,3 April 2021,"Fresh off the groundbreaking success of ""The Godfather,"" Marlon Brando was catapulted back to the spotlight. His next film was the controversial (even by today's standards) erotic film directed by Bernardo Bertallucci. Brando turns in what is arguably his very best performance in one of his finest films.Brando plays middle-aged American hotel owner living in Paris named Paul. His wife, Rose, recently committed suicide, leaving Paul in a melancholy state. We never know why Rose took her life, which is actually a good move on the writing. There are no easy answers in real life.Maria Schneider plays Jeanne, a young woman soon-to-be-engaged to a film director, who stumbles into a blank hotel room and meets Paul. She finds him interesting and is ready to have a fling with nearly anyone.The hotel room they have their relationship in is not the same one in the loft that Paul owns. This room is drab and blank. Despite having no colour or furniture or decorations, we are immediately sucked into this world where our leads have no names and begin a physical affair. While Jeanne is sprouting as a woman, Paul desperately wants to shut out everything in the world. But it can't last for long as Paul must deal with funeral expenses.The thing about Brando that makes him top of the line is not only his believability and sheer conviction, but how deep he makes his characters. Paul feels betrayed at his wife's suicide and wants to live in his own little world where he doesn't have to feel so much pain. This is just a little bit of a deep character.I don't know Maria Schneider, but she did a great job too. Her nuances are surprising and she does hold her own in what is a basically two-person character study.One thing I will say is that this has not aged well. Jeanne is like 20, Paul is 45, and they have sex within seconds of meeting. In reality, she would have been calling out rape. How this woman less than half this man's age agrees to a sexual relationship with him is beyond me. I guess it was the time. And at the end when the characters change, it seems a little sudden and out of the blue.These flaws are only visible if you aren't completely sucked into this world. Most people would be fully immersed and feel every little thing that happens. A movie is great if it is able to do that.4/4.",Last Tango in Paris
41,p-stepien,Intellectually cold,7,10 October 2012,"A widowed middle-aged American (Marlon Brando) and a young Parisian student (Maria Schneider) happen upon the same apartment when searching for alternative living space. The two enter into a loose pivotally sexual relationship, where one of the ground rules states that they must keep the mystery. Their life together begins and ends outside the confines of the apartment and the true life beyond is never to be spoken off.""The Last Tango in Paris"" is intellectually cold, but undeniably masterful. However despite an artistic admiration of the context it permeates with vile, making it unpleasant and ultimately none too likable. The crass theme with a detached female lead and a strongly masculine riveting Brando can be fascinating, but Bertolucci's erotic drama feels somewhat pretentious when delivering the final act. When mystery dissipates between the lovers the women is no longer enticed, enthralled by this forceful man, giving off a slight misogynistic premise, which culminates the movie. Brando is overwhelmingly brilliant capturing attention and ranging from foul and disgusting to utterly demoniacally charming - the emotional scale of brilliance is truly profound. On the other hand Schneider plays a more empty vessel, a recipient of Brando's emotions, hardly given enough motivation and context to truly have viewers engage with her persona. Together they enter into sexual practises, which however have little eroticism, instead filled with pain, loss and confusion as they use their time together to release inner demons.Throughout the picture Maria Schneider's character takes part in filming an meta-film with her boyfriend and ultimately fiancée, where rather crudely and superficially Bertolucci attempts to present a movie within a movie theme, making commentaries about the audacity he had of filming such a piece. Possibly a victim of ageing it no longer feels as captivating and fresh as back in the days, now more a figurehead of former glory, slowly losing its breakthrough importance. Possibly still a masterpiece, but one that doesn't make for easy watching and hardly offers cinematic pleasure...",Last Tango in Paris
42,bandw,"Erotic, moody, funny, angry, mysterious, sad, complex, edgy, ...",10,20 April 2006,"My first reaction after having watched this movie was, ""That's one hell of a movie.""Brando gives one of his best performances (and that is saying a lot) as Paul, an American expatriate living in Paris. He has just lost his wife to suicide and a chance meeting with Jeanne (Maria Schneider) sparks the most highly charged and explicitly erotic relationship ever filmed for general audiences. One is in awe of Brando for taking on a role like this - it is difficult to imagine any other major star having the guts to tackle such sensational material, let alone pull it off. Brando's great achievement here is to appear like he is not acting. Rarely does one see an actor display such raw emotion on screen. It's as if Paul's pain is Brando's; never has sorrow been more compellingly portrayed. As is often noted, Brando's scene at his wife's casket is a classic - we see anger, regret, love, sorrow, guilt, disgust, confusion, loss, and perplexity in the space of five minutes. And Maria Schneider brings more to the event than a beautiful body. Her career may not have taken off subsequent to this movie, but she is wonderful for this part. Perhaps Bertolucci can be credited in part for her performance.The cinematography is exquisite, every scene is a small work of art. The musical score by Gato Barbieri is unpredictable and never boring, but it is a bit too intrusive at times.The suicide is central to the story. It remains a mystery to Paul as well as to the viewer. The filming accentuates the idea of how mysterious and unknowable we are to each other. In so many scenes the characters speak to each other separated by a wall, or one of them is in the dark, or they are speaking to each other on opposite sides of frosted or colored glass. Perhaps the suicide of Paul's wife led him to a belief in the impossibility of knowing others, even those we are close to, and prompted his desire for an anonymous relationship with Jeanne. Why even bother pretending? And when we see what happens when Paul does attempt a knowing relationship with Jeanne we are made to understand that we enter relationships not without risk. I found Paul's motivations more understandable than Jeanne's. Why does she readily submit to Paul's domination? Is it because she senses he desires her more than her feckless fiancée (a filmmaker who never makes it clear to Jeanne whether he is seeing her, or a character in a movie)? At least Jeanne can see that Paul's desire is real. When Paul moves out of the apartment, Jeanne seems distraught, but when he reappears and she is forced to decide between him and her fiancée, she acts on an impulse that decides the matter in a rather dramatic and final way.Jeanne's final lines, ""I don't know him. I don't know who he is. He's a madman. I don't know his name,"" puts a fitting punctuation mark on the story. We behave in ways that are mysterious, even to ourselves.This movie was ahead of its time in 1972 and, if it were to have been made in 2006, it would still be ahead of its time.",Last Tango in Paris
43,tomsview,"Untangling ""Last Tango""",7,7 September 2013,"""Last Tango in Paris"" is the old-guy fantasy-flick par excellence. A young, sexy and compliant girl has an affair with a balding, middle-aged man with an expanding waistline, and allows him to use butter in places other than on his breakfast croissant. Taken on any level, ""Last Tango in Paris"" is self-indulgent in concept and execution.Controversial from the start, it received an R certificate in those countries where it wasn't banned outright. Brando's performance in this film divided the critics. Some considered it one of his best while others thought it pretentious rubbish. There is little doubt that despite the self-gratifying improvisations, Brando delivers one of his most complex characters.Set in Paris, the movie begins as it means to go with Brando's character, Paul, screaming obscenities as a train roars past. He meets a young woman, Jeanne, played by Maria Schneider, when they both inspect an empty apartment. They begin a torrid affair. At first, Paul demands that they do not reveal their identities, confining their knowledge of each other to their physical encounters in the run-down apartment.Jeanne is the girlfriend of a filmmaker, Tom, who is making a film about her. Tom is in love with himself, filmmaking and Jeanne in that order. He is unaware of the affair she is having with the stranger in Paris.Paul's French wife, Rosa, has committed suicide only a day or two previously. Paul and Rosa ran a small hotel together. Paul is a man with issues and these come to the fore when his wife's mother arrives and starts to arrange her daughter's funeral.The intermittent affair between Jeanne and Paul continues as arrangements for Rosa's funeral are made. However, their couplings start to take on a more sadomasochistic edge.Jeanne wants to end the affair, but Paul begins to reveal more and more about himself. When she rejects him and tries to leave, he refuses to accept the situation and pursues her to her parent's home with unexpected results.After 40 years, ""Last Tango"" is detached from the era and the attitudes that originally gave it shape. However, it hasn't dated noticeably – even allowing for the 70's Peugots and Citroens that appear on remarkably empty Paris streets.Schneider's character is petulant, spoilt and confused but her performance is passionate and volatile. Innocent looking but promiscuous, she is very believable as a woman who could exacerbate the mid-life crisis in Brando's character.Brando delivers a number of monologues in this film that have an improvised quality. Unfortunately, he is allowed to ramble on to the detriment of the film's pace. One sequence in particular, reminds one of a naughty child thinking up the rudest things he can say to elicit a shocked reaction.But another sequence is quite different. What does one think and say when confronted by the suicide of a loved one? Brando may have nailed it in this disturbing passage. The challenging character of Paul – whimsical and mischievous one minute, aggressive and depressed the next is hailed as one of Brando's most powerful creations. Bertolucci has been accused of demanding that Brando dig too deep to find the pain within himself for this film, and Brando said that he never wanted to make another film as emotionally draining as this one.Is ""Last Tango"" a masterpiece? It all depends on your point of view. Like the acting career of Brando himself – there are frequent touches of brilliance but there is also much that is pure self-indulgence – there just doesn't seem to be anything in-between.Both Brando and Schneider are gone now; knowing this gives the movie extra poignancy that neither of the stars could have imagined at the time.",Last Tango in Paris
44,DeeNine-2,Stunning performance by Brando,10,10 June 2007,"On the cover of the paperback edition of my novel ""A Perfectly Natural Act"" there is the blurb: ""As compelling as Last Tango in Paris!"" (This is not a shameless plug since my novel is long out of print.) When your work is touted as being ""like"" some earlier, successful work, you can be sure what is really being said is your work is not all that good and needs some hype to move it off the shelves.So it took me 33 years to finally get around to watching ""Last Tango..."" and that is all to the good because if I had watched it when I was young, the barbarous sexuality would have sorely distracted me. Well, Maria Schneider (Jeanne) would have. She is very sexy and is shown complete (""she comes complete""!) in a number of scenes. Her acting ability has been challenged by some, but I thought she did a nice job in a difficult role.Problem was she was paired opposite Marlon Brando (Paul) who was busy giving one of his greatest performances. Brando said some time afterwards that he never wanted to do anything like this again. Presumably he was referring to the depressing nature of human sexuality portrayed in the film. This is ironic since most of the raunchy and degrading lines are spoken by Brando who improvised them himself! He later commented that some of the lines written by director Bernado Bertolucci were not to his liking. What I think happened is Bertolucci wanted to live out as a director one of his youthful fantasies (raw, anonymous sex with a young beauty) and Brando, with his ultra sophistication about such matters, played his part with a brutal satirical edge, perhaps making fun of Bertolucci's fantasy, turning it into an unpleasant, hard reality.But the ""reality"" was a bit over the top for everybody. The infamous ""Get the butter"" scene, which was improvised by Brando and Bertolucci (to Schneider's dismay), made it clear that Paul considered Jeanne an animal that you used and nothing more. The dead rat scene and all the pig talk, ditto. Brando was also projecting his own feelings. He was 48-years-old when the film was released and was getting a paunch and losing his muscle tone. All the sex scenes but one are filmed with Brando clothed so as not to make the decline of his physical prowess obvious. He projected his own feelings about the decline of his body by referring derisively to his hemorrhoids, his prostate, and his paunch.What Brando does so very well here is become that animalistic, but thinking brute who has his way with women because they cannot resist his alpha male prowess regardless of the gray in his hair. The early scene in the apartment when the nameless Brando just takes the nameless Schneider without so much as a spoken word or a caress might make women say ""if only more men could be so commanding,"" and men say ""I wish I had that kind of confidence."" I am reminded Brando's Stanley Kowalski in A Streetcar Named Desire (1951) except that here little is left to the imagination. The Brando that was Kowalski at twenty-seven (with an I.Q. upgrade) could easily be the Brando that was Paul at forty-eight.Almost all the discussion about this movie is about Brando, and that is certainly understandable since, despite all the ugliness of the film, it featured one of Brando's greatest performances. However, the movie was and is Bertolucci's. He wrote it and directed it. His original cut runs something like four hours. The version here rated NC-17 runs 136 minutes. The problem is that just about everything in the movie that does not included Brando is a bit of an anticlimax or an irrelevancy. Jean-Pierre Leaud (Tom) of Truffaut's The Four Hundred Blows (1959) fame plays a film maker and Jeanne's intended. He was possibly chosen for the film because his boyish style and demeanor would contrast so sharply with Brando's commanding style. Two lovers had Jeanne: one was easy and boring, the other was scary and exciting. But I think Bertolucci was also having some fun with the French cinema and especially with Francois Truffaut. Perhaps it is only a coincidence that a year later Truffaut would release Day for Night (1973) (La Nuit americaine) in which Truffaut plays a director directing Leaud in a kind of pleasing but lightweight film contrasting sharply with the dark psychosis of Last Tango.I don't think I could sit through the four hour version but it might be a good learning experience for young film makers. At any rate, perhaps some of the seeming illogic of the film might become reasonable, including the all too easy and not entirely explicable ending. I rate this film very highly because it was innovative (rather shocking for its time), with a fine jazz score, but mostly because of Brando's stellar performance and the sensual beauty of a 20-year-old Maria Schneider. By the way, the film is in French and English with subtitles. Brando's French is amusing, and whoever dubbed Schneider's English has a cute and witty voice.Another excellent (and very beautiful) film by Bertolucci is The Conformist (1970) starring Jean-Louis Trintignant, Stefania Sandrelli, and Dominque Sanda. Interestingly enough Sanda was originally picked for Last Tango, as was Trintignant, and she would have given some needed depth to Jeanne's character, but she declined I guess because of all the nudity. Ironically a few years later Schneider was tabbed to play the lead in Luis Brunuel's That Obscure Object of Desire (1977) but dropped out during the filming reportedly because of a nude scene! Maybe she was afraid of becoming typecast.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!""

45,Howlin Wolf,"Shocking. Shockingly minimalist, vulgar, and worst of all - tedious!",2,27 March 2004,"I've not seen much of Brando, but a lot of the time I sense that he was merely coasting by on reputation alone. Schneider reminds me of Beatrice Dalle in ""Betty Blue"" (A different - and better - type of film than this one) but less sexy and a hundredth as interesting to watch. The entire film is drab to look at, perhaps intentionally because of the transience of the characters, but sadly, 'dull' is still 'dull' however you try to excuse it. I think we're SUPPOSED to feel an element of revulsion at the vulgarity, but it makes the film even less appealing, which obscures any serious point that is perhaps trying to be made. There is no sympathy for the rootless existence of the characters, more a case of: ""Behave yourself Marlon, you dirty old perv!"" (and he was comparatively YOUNG when he made this!)It was the ""memorable quotes"" section on this here site that inspired me to write a review. It made me realise just how pretentious the whole 'affair' (take the term how you wish) actually is. Convergence of older man and younger woman? Potentially provocative if dealt with correctly. Here, instead Bertolucci seems incapable of recognising profundity for something that is simply uncouth.As far as I'm concerned, the film's sexual element is most appropriate merely because the piece itself seems to be the cinematic equivalent of masturbation; perhaps gratifying for those involved, for everybody else, uncomfortable at best!",Last Tango in Paris

The two meet by chance in an empty apartment--and immediately embark upon an anonymous affair in which Brando seeks to both purge and renew himself through Schneider.Both stars offer intense performances, and director Bertolucci invests the film with numerous poetic and symbolic flourishes. The cinematography is elegant; the score is quite interesting. But when everything is said and done, LAST TANGO IN Paris is extremely thin stuff that relies on sexual shock to generate tension--and what was once shocking is now passe. At the time TANGO was made, it was unthinkable that a major Hollywood star would appear in such a film... Yet by today's standards, the nudity involved is quite mild, the sex scenes are surprisingly discreet, and the script is oddly naive. It all seems very tame.Moreover, the film's subplots slow the action to a crawl and the film as a whole has a self-conscious, faintly pretentious tone. Brando and Schneider, both separately and together, offer quite a few impressive moments, but you have to wade through a lot to get to them. Is it worth it? Difficult to say.

47,aciessi,Mid Day in Paris,9,9 November 2015,"""Go get the butter"".Moral of the story is, people were very easily shocked by things in the 1970's. Everyone brings up the ""butter"" scene from this movie, but that's only because it was one of the first mainstream movies, outside of hardcore porn, that depicted anal sex on film. So I guess that merits the X- rating it got then? Well, that same year gave us ""Deliverance"", which included the first man-on- man rape scene ever depicted in a mainstream movie. That got an R-rating. Is this gender bias? I digress.Last Tango in Paris is a roller-coaster, and an uneasy experience. It dances with the idea that we turn to the dark side when we grieve. Our main character fools around with a young, engaged, Parisian women, in hopes of forgetting about the suicide of his wife and dysfunction of his funeral arrangements. The more he torments himself with the thought of his wife's death, the more he becomes a sexual deviant. When he locks himself up in the apartment with his mistress, so many things start to unravel, and he plays with her heart so badly, that by the end of the picture, he chases her down, thinking that he has found new love when she is so disgusted by his behavior, that she ultimately shoots him between the legs.This is a contemporary tragedy. Pure, unadulterated Bertolucci. This is also Brando at the peak of his career, straight off of the set of The Godfather, and what we get, is one of the most dedicated, heart wrenching performances of all time. He is so broken down, it's painful to watch. It's a hard movie, but it's just really rewarding in the end.",Last Tango in Paris

While certainly sexually frank, even today, it is far too European art house for most tastes.The plot idles, stops and jerks like a country milk train, leaving so many questions unanswered that you have to write half the script in your own head to get through it.Brando's portrait of a man that seems torn between falling in love and falling under a bus is certainly unique. Especially as most viewers and critics had concluded that he had already shown his full hand of cards. In contrast co-star Schnieder is amazing in being able to put together a performance from so little. Indeed she is just an inflated muse, who the film seems little interested in.My problem with the film is that it is about emptiness, depression and alienation; but there is so much of it about anyway (and always has been, just turn on the news!) that going looking for in cinema seems pointless. The sex is not really sexy, merely people trying to enliven their dull lives not unlike people who take drugs to achieve the same. If there is romance here, it can only be seen as a sadomasochistic romance played out among damaged people.LTIP is certainly a milestone picture, if only for Brando's totally open and no holds barred performance, but it leaves far too many question unanswered to be anything like a classic. Indeed this is merely an exercise in mood, tempo and design and was a box office hit because people had not seen frank sexuality on the screen like this before.The world of sex-on-film has moved on so much since this was released that today's audience will not have a clue what caused the press headlines.

49,tonypeacock-1,"Extremely dated, boring and monotonous.",5,30 March 2019,"An supposed controversial film on its 1972 release. It now looks extremely over rated and for want of a better word boring.Set in Paris, as the title suggests it stars Marlon Brando, fresh from his 'refused' Academy Award Best Actor for The Godfather.Brando plays a portly forty something American who lives in Paris called Paul who is left heartbroken at the death/supposed suicide/murder of his wife Rosa.
He seeks solace in casual sex with a young Parisian Jeanne (Maria Schneider) after a chance meeting when looking to rent an apartment.What follows is an extremely slow moving story of their tryst broken up with a few sexual encounters. Some of which fell foul of international censors, courts and campaigners at the time of release. I am talking about a butter rape scene in particular, sticking fingers up orifices.I am not offended, I just find it a distracting part of the story and some excellent acting from Brando in particular. Especially in one scene where he talks to the dead corpse of his wife.
She is lying in some sort of state surrounded by flowers and plastered in make-up. Her deeply religious mother might have something to do with that.Jeanne herself is supposedly about to marry some geeky, annoying French film maker.
It also transpires that Rosa partook in an affair when alive. Indeed Paul meets the guy and they enjoy a Bourbon dressed in matching bath robes?It is not my type of film at all really. I can't see the fuss it caused. It is intensely boring and slow moving for long periods as Paul parambles around a Citroen 2CV filled 1970s Paris.The last act of the film sees Paul and Jeanne, who still don't know each other's names, gatecrash a dancing contest drunkenly. The dancers are dancing to the tango.Jeanne dumps Paul and rushes back to the apartment with Paul in pursuit.

50,RJBurke1942,"An existential examination of the human condition, warts and all",10,24 April 2007,"I missed this film when it came out in 1972, not seeing it for the first time until 1998 or so. Then, just a few days ago, I decided to see it again and provide a review.The first time round, in 1998, I thought it was a very funny movie – with moments of pathos, of course – and with truly astounding acting from Brando. Well, I still think it's a very funny movie, Brando is still great in the role of Paul, but now I'm more impressed with the story and Bertolucci's direction.At it's core, this is an existentialist paean about love and identity: what they are and how they bring about relationships. Of course, this is Bertolucci's point of view because he wrote the story. Is it autobiographical? Probably there is some of that great Italian director in this story....This is the plot: recent widower Paul (Brando) meets young and wild Jeanne (Schneider) for free sex, no holds barred, no positions barred, no acts barred. It's not love, it's just nihilistic sex for the sake of mindlessness and anonymity. Why? Well, Paul's wife has just committed suicide after years of marriage and infidelity with one of the permanent residents, Marcel (Massimo Girotti) in the hotel owned by Paul and Rosa, his now dead wife. Paul is thus on an emotional voyage of self-denial and self-discovery while he tries to come to terms with Rosa's betrayal – or what Paul views as betrayal.Paul and Jeanne have riotous and uninhibited sex almost every day – while she also makes a film with her true love, Tom (Jean-Pierre Leaud), who regards her as the purest, finest example of woman that any man could find! Aaaah, such irony....So, there they are: the two illicit lovers on a last fling before they each have to make commitment. Paul sees her for what he never got from Rosa – total immersion in his persona, no questions asked (literally – Paul insists that they do not exchange names) by either of them. Paul wants to know nothing about her – but she pesters him all the time wanting to know, because she wants to know...So, naturally, the relationships sours gradually until she decides to break and run – into a dance hall, where there is a tango contest in progress which, naturally, Paul disrupts in a boisterous and over-the-top fashion (a very funny sequence) as he realizes that he must pursue Jeanne because he finally thinks he really loves her. She runs on and out, he pursues her through the streets of Paris until she arrives at her mother's place (where else is a girl to run to?) and when Paul arrives and bursts in to the apartment, she grabs her dead father's gun and...game over. She's left standing there, muttering ""I don't know his name, he chased me, came into my apartment to rape me, I don't know his name...etc"" Bertolucci created a great and ironic contrast between the raw animal sex affair of Paul and Jeanne versus the true love picture (read 'myth') – for that's how Bertolucci sees it – of Jeanne and Tom which, oddly enough, ends with a handshake when the two cannot agree to rent the very apartment in which she had such a torrid affair with Paul. Tom, of course, had no knowledge of that affair. Perhaps, that was Bertolucci's way of saying how all relationships should end – with a very civilized handshake? Jean-Paul Sartre probably would have applauded.The ending is multi-layered, naturally: regardless of how well we think we know our partners, lovers, friends, how much do we really know, truly? How can we know anybody, if we cannot know ourselves. And, if we cannot know ourselves, how can we love anybody, truly, madly, deeply?I regard Brando's performance as the best of his career (he won the Oscar for The Godfather the previous year, so it's not surprising he lost out to Jack Lemmon in 1973, for this movie). Maria Schneider provides a truly uninhibited portrayal of a young woman out for a good time. The rest of the cast is very professional, as you'd expect in a Bertolucci film.The sound track is bizarre, except for the music at the dance contest – which is all tango music anyway. For most of the film, there are only brief, almost discordant notes that precede or succeed a shot or a sequence – as though Bertolucci is using the music as a metaphor for jarring notes that occur in our daily lives. When you see the movie, that may become clear as you watch.I don't recommend this film for those who can't watch explicit sex, foul and highly erotic language, sodomy, masturbation and the rest of it. This is for people who really want to think about what it truly means to be a human animal – and with all that that implies.I think it's one of the best movies ever made.April 24, 2007Copyright 2007, Roger J Burke.

51,Imdbidia,Masterpiece,9,19 March 2011,"Last Tango in Paris is one of these movies with a story and characters that get stuck to your memory and heart for a long time. It tells the story of the sexual relationship between Paul (Marlon Brando) a mature selfish widower mourning his deceased wife, and Jeanne (Maria Schneider)a naive 20y.o. emotionally immature girl with an unsatisfying relationship that she tries to accommodate to by opening to sexual experimentation outside it. The movie is not about sex, it is about obsession, manipulation, grieving, deceit, primal emotions and social constrictions.= The Characters = Paul is an obsessive person, who had an open relationship who is shocked and disappointed by the death of her love, and by her suicide, which he feels as a proof of emotional treachery. A mix of grief and hatred, pain and disenchantment with institutionalized love, and the constrictions and lies of Society, is what Paul has when he founds Jeanne. She is half his age and easy to manipulate as she's emotionally insecure and unhappy as her boyfriend is using her as a doll and object of love, more than a subject of love. Paul channels or his conflicting emotions through raw sex, not shared, as he forces Jeanne into a situation that she wants to break from very early in their relationship. Jeanne is looking from love and for personal appreciation, to be loved for who she is. However, Paul creates a situation of complete domination, emotional and sexual, by establishing the rules of their meetings, which only benefit him. The Society and world that he wants to leave behind is, after all, a return to Paradise, a revival of primal instincts in which sex has no meaning. The fact that the couple play and talk like baboons is a metaphor of this primeval relationship. The movie is disturbing sometimes, but not because of the sex scenes, which are very few and simulated, but because of the meaning associated to them.In Jeanne's case, the carnal relationship is the catalyst of her inner awareness as person, of her vulnerability and strength, of what she wants and what she does not want in life and in a relationship. In fact, despite her obsession with Paul, she is able to see her own dependence and starts to fight it to end cutting it. In fact when Brando appears as a healed man and tells her the truth about himself adding that he wants to get seriously involved with her, it is too late for Jeanne. What happens at the end, from the point of view of Jeanne, was her only way to escape.= The performances = Brando is great in his performance, superb sometimes, especially when he's able to relax in front of the camera and improvise those monologues in which he was great. The scene in which the recalls the story of his childhood is so real, so powerful, that you feel that he's that person he's talking about. I found that some of his cry scenes were heartfelt, but did feel overacting in some others. Overall, however, it is a fantastic performance he delights us with. Terrific and very believable is his scene with Massimo Girotti, who plays his wife's lover, Marcel, in which, again, Brando seems to improvise and talks with great conviction. Despite Schneider's acting being criticized as poor, the truth is that she brings to her role exactly what it needed and what Bertolucci wanted the character to be. She plays with freshness, naivety, and emotional maturity a character that has many shades overlooked by those who see Brando and cannot see anything else. The age and experience of Brando and Schneider mimic those of the characters they play, so it makes everything flowing easily and be convincing.= The sex scenes = The raunchy images that scandalized the world in the 1970s are, in most cases, not that raunchy for modern standards. Nudity is limited, and bed scenes are more suggested and talked about that really shown. The only scene that I consider confronting is the one involving butter as it is not sexy or hot or funny, but a rape scene - both physical and emotional. I had this strong reaction against the scene, and I found it disturbing, despite the fact that the characters are dressed and that too many people say that it is hot. Being a woman, the rape feeling was very real to me. And alas, I've just read an interview to Maria Schneider in which she tells many interesting things about the movie (http: // www. dailymail. co. uk/ tvshowbiz/ article-469646/ I-felt-raped-Brando.html) and mentions that the scene wasn't originally in the script, that it was Brando's idea, and that she did not wanted to go on with it, but she was forced to do it, that she felt raped, and that her tears in the movie were real and personal, not the characters'. = The atmosphere = I thought the atmosphere was one of the best things of the movie as reflects the spirit and/or essence of the characters masterly. The atmosphere is dark and claustrophobic when Paul and his life are the centre, offering bizarre classic horror-like scenes, especially clear in the famous scene between Paul and his deceased wife. The atmosphere is clear, luminous, fresh and even bucolic when Jeanne is in her world with her friends, boyfriend and in her childhood house. The atmosphere an warm, full of chiaroscuro, and minimal when the coupe is in the apartment together. The atmosphere is decadent, theatrical, run out -so to speak- in the scenes in the Tango place.The music by Gato Barbieri is beautiful but unsettling.= The flaws= I found the movie a little too long, and some bits and pieces unnecessary and uneven in its tempo. The wardrobe is quite limited, too!It is a complex movie, not for everybody.",Last Tango in Paris
52,abcvision,French cookie,8,21 July 2014,"One movie that had been on my list to watch was Last Tango in Paris. It was heavily referenced in the documentary Seduced and Abandoned where Bernado Bertolucci shares how this movie captured a side of Marlon Brando and he refused to talk to him for 7 years after that. The movie is about an American played by Marlon Brando who finds himself in Paris after the death of his wife. He seeks comfort in a French woman Jeanne (Maria Schneider). They begin a passionate affair that pushes the limits of lust and sexual ecstasy. At the time of the release this movie was given a rating of X, but seems pretty tamed in today's world. The story came from a dream that Bertolucci had about having an anonymous sexual encounter with a woman he did not know or never would know. Pretty much every man's dream, pleasurable erotic, guiltless sex. It blends the magic of the French sensuality with the aggressive American attitude. A masterful film and a classic that needs to be seen by all movie buffs.",Last Tango in Paris
53,Didier-Becu,LAST TANGO IN PARIS (DIDIER BECU),6,27 March 2004,"Well there used to be a time at where people could be shocked but living in a society that is today we've seen it all and due to that we must see ""Last tango in Paris"" as well as after all it was more an effort to shock rather than coming up with a perfect movie. In the seventies it was popular to make movies about making movies itself (just think of Truffaut's ""La nuit americaine"") and in Bertolucci's movie we have the same. We follow a woman (no name) who stays in Paris at where she met an American (no name either, but played by Marlon Brando). The two need each other for all various reasons (sex is probably the top of the list) but the rule is that they may reveal nothing about the past, but the viewer is giving a look behind the scenes and we found out that Marlon's wife killed herself. A suicide that drives him made and that he tries to forget in playing all various sexgames. Of course it can be sex alone and it's only when love comes around the corner that the problems begin.""Last tango in Paris"" isn't dated at all, it's even a good movie (the first ten minutes are cinematographic highlights) but as said the thrill itself has gone. Still quite funny to see the godfather speak terrible French and a godlike Maria Schneider. Quite difficult to imagine that two decades later Bertolucci would make something like ""The last emperor"" or ""The sheltering sky"" though...",Last Tango in Paris

Even with no immediate financial worries, illnesses or other measurable problems, the line between happiness and despair is a thin one.Marlon Brando, as always, gives a stellar performance. Here he is the middle aged American who is puzzled by his beautiful Parisian wife's suicide. As the story unfolds, we learn of the character's entangled history, one that finally has reached a dead end in a labyrinth of a search for life's meaning.A glimmer of hope comes into Brando's life when he encounters a 20-ish woman, with whom he immediately shares a bizarre sexual relationship which includes violence and sodomy. Minor characters are no less strange, especially the hotel concierge as well as the young woman's independent film-maker fiancé.The cinematography is innovative, exploring many new angles of the art. An empty, neglected flat offers many possibilities. Frequent nudity and simulated sex acts are effectively spun into the story, without appearing gratuitous. It becomes clear that the story told here can not have a happily ever after ending, thus the concluding shocker is less of a surprise.This film is definitely for adults (even the R rated version would be difficult to watch for anyone less mature than age 18). An important piece of cinema, even if not for everyone's taste. For Brando fans this is, of course, mandatory viewing.",Last Tango in Paris
55,jayjaycee,Detestable subject matter with some fascinating technical features,7,31 January 2021,"""Ultimo tango a Parigi (The Last Tango In Paris)"" is 1972 drama directed by Bernardo Bertolucci starring Marlon Brando and Maria Schneider.
⚪
All in all, Bernardo Bertolucci's controversial drama scandalously clings to a shockingly erotic dance partner of melancholy, depression and toxicity, as it depicts the difficult relationship of its protagonists with unadulterated ugliness and a certain kind of bitter power, and even if there are countless contemptible things shown, it inexplicably manages to equally bore with the lack of a distinct plot and intrigue with its sheer raw emotional intensity, and by furthermore having Brando and Schneider, displaying versatile and emotional acting, this contentious drama is deservedly a controversial and disgusting, yet weirdly eccentric and absurdly fascinating contemplation about life, love, hate and human relationships, ultimately impressing with how it deals with its subject matter, not with what it depicts.
⚪
As my entry for the ""Extremely Shocking, Wicked and Vile!"" community project hosted by the witty @whattheflickreviews, as a part of which selected accounts came together to present and review films generally considered to be controversial, disturbing and infamous, I decided to watch an Italian classic by notorious director Bernardo Bertolucci, and oh my god, this film indeed makes the title of this project justice. What is it about? Well, honestly, I cannot really summarise properly what this film deals with, for there are a myriad of aspects about it, but on its core it's a drama about two humans, a middle-aged man and a young woman, having an unusual kind of affair in the city of love. Paul, shatteringly portrayed by ""A Streetcar Named Desire"" superstar Marlon Brando, is an American businessman living in Paris who tries to deal with the tragic suicide of his wife Rosa, and on the other hand, we have Maria Schneider playing the twenty-year-old girl Jeanne trying to gain a foothold in the same famous city. However, after a mysterious encounter at an apartment inspection, the two begin to bond in a strange way: Paul wants to keep it all anonymously, furthermore at one location only, the rancid flat they first met at. He doesn't want that they know each other's true identity, so they begin a relationship solely on the basis of sex - and what follows is an utterly detestable yet weirdly intriguing journey. The infamous Italian director Bertolucci made no secret of it that he brought his most perverse and despicable male fantasy to the big screen, as he reportedly always wanted to have an affair with a ""way younger"" woman in a ""foreign city"". As a result of this questionable undertaking, we got this strange drama, and when I say strange, I mean that it is indeed very strange. Remember that this film came out in the early seventies, a time when things were different. Next to graphic nudity, suicide and profanity, there are also many, many aspects that personally disgust me a lot, like rape and misogynism. What makes it even harder to draw a line between reality and fiction is that Bertolucci treated his female lead in the worst way possible, for example as the most infamous rape scene was added to the script in the last minute, without her knowing. So to say, she was raped on screen, and I freaking hate the director for his sick methods. Furthermore, Schneider's Jeanne is depicted as a girl with no distinct personality, and the only thing that in fact defines her is the dependence to men that treat her like a lifeless object rather than a human being. Her soon-to-be fiancé Tom only exploits her as the leading actress for his film project, and is simply interested in the fame he can achieve by taking advantage of her, on the other hand, she is abused by Paul as a living sex toy, and both of it is just distasteful. Yes, even though it is mostly advertised as such, this film is anything but a romance, quite the contrary, I would categorise it as an anti-romance. Paul and Maria are having a toxic relationship, where the first abuses the latter constantly, and even though he does her wrong most of the time, she comes back to him, saying that she loves him (as it sadly might be the case often). Seriously, once you started the film, you are trapped inside the most disgusting and vile male fantasy one could come up with. Is it a thoroughly terrible film, though? Funnily enough, no, and I really I hate so say this and give it credit, but before you lapidate me at this point, let me once again make clear that I absolutely object everything this film stands for - but that I am amazed by how it is crafted (well, at least everything next to the treatment of the female lead, of course). What makes this movie great is not what it shows but how it shows everything. In fact, there is no actual plot, and in instances I was left utterly confused by what it just witnessed. Like, the premise is what this film is about, but at the same time it is an elastic term. It is uneventful, incoherent and, honestly, completely pointless most of the time. However, in the end, I had the feeling that this was done on purpose and that the ""plot"", if you may consider it as such, only serves as a means to an end. Ultimately, each scene is just a fragment, a powerful feeling and the film is a concatenation of all those. It doesn't want to make sense in the first place, it wants to make you feel - all kinds of sensations, and in the end, this undeniably weird approach worked out, because each scene displays this utterly heavy, gritty emotional intensity - and it packs a punch most of the time. It is shocking, outrageous and yet fascinating. Furthermore, despite his irrefutably disgusting nature, I think that Paul is indeed a phenomenally constructed and eclectic character. On the surface, he is an extremely toxic and absolutely wicked human being, but as the film moves on, his haunted personality becomes more and more clear. I am not going to say that it makes his character likable, quite the contrary, because in the end, he is still the same deplorable jerk he has been in the beginning, but there are several minimal moments in which we learn about him a lot. Most prominently, he struggles a lot with the suicide of his wife and this one specific scene in which he ""talks"" to her, I was once again impressed by Brando, who delivers as superbly as per usual. It is formally never said directly, but many times it is hinted that he was probably raped as a child, abused by his own parents, and indeed is unable to cope with the loss of his own wife. It is undeniably no excuse for his behaviour, but an explanation as to why he is what he is. In a sad and appalling manner, he beguiles Jeanne to escape his own inner turmoil, to give free rein to his inner demons, to numb the desperation that haunts him. Even though I absolutely hate what this film stands for, I cannot deny a certain technical brilliance that underlies this film. Bertolucci's methods were horrifying, and I am definitely not going to say that it was the right thing to do, because it simply was, but on the other hand, there were still other aspects that made it a weird yet peculiar drama. In the end, it is deservedly considered as a controversial title, because there are so many objectionable aspects about it, on the other hand it is ingeniously crafted. It's a perverse, nihilistic, melancholic and escapist contemplation about life, love, hate and sexuality that's as drastic as it gets. Despite its undeniably repulsive themes, it still manages to become weirdly fascinating. Without a doubt one of the most controversial films I have ever seen, and probably the best choice I could have made to participate in this promising community project.",Last Tango in Paris
56,barberoux,Brando is good,6,2 December 2002,"Maybe at the time this movie came out it was considered an arty, deep movie that examined the sexual relationship of its two stars but I think it has not aged well.  I considered the movie rather pretentious and the leads, Brando and Maria Schneider, were not really that appealing enough to care about.  Maria Schneider played the sex object and admittingly she was a hot babe with a wonderful body but that was all she was.  She seemed a rather confused, spoiled young girl that got involved in an, at times brutal, sexual relationship with a man who would be called, in today's parlance, abusive.  Brando was a bully in this movie almost raping Maria Schneider in the beginning and verbally abusing an older woman later.  The mother of his dead wife came to bury her daughter and Brando was so cruel to her that she raised her arms in defense to ward off a blow.  She may have been a pain in the butt to Brando but I think his character's treatment of her was unjustifiably mean.  He was also a bully towards Maria Schneider's character.  Maybe this tone was acceptable at the time but I found it distasteful.  Possibly the ending was justified given this tone.  Brando did give some fine performances is some scenes especially during his talk with his wife's corpse.  Unfortunately overall the movie failed for me because I never really developed any empathy for the leads.  Brando did elicited some sympathy for his grief but his character was too cruel to really care about. Maria Schneider is not that great an actress and her character was too dippy and immature to care about.  I only wanted her to disrobe.  For that she was cast perfectly.",Last Tango in Paris
57,cinephile-27690,"Passionate, Powerful, and Practically Perfect.",10,20 February 2019,"I love this Marlon Brando movie more than The Godfather. That's right, I said it! I just finished watching Last Tango in Paris and it's currently in my top 5 favorite movies, and I wish I could underline that 5. I even shocked myself by placing it one spot above My Fair Lady, my favorite musical!I would rather not go deep into the plot. I will quickly say it's about the relationship of an elderly man and a young woman of about 19 that is solely based on sex.The acting in this movie is nothing less than brilliant. Marlon Brando does what I consider to be his finest acting role as Paul. His woman is played by Maria Schneider, and I have to say she is ONE OF the prettiest actresses I've ever seen in a movie.I next to never comment of cinematography, but LTIP has some of the most beautiful of it's kind. (At times it looks dated due to the film reel, but that's forgivable since the movie's over 45 years old!)Last Tango is a very moving movie, it excited my soul(for lack of a better phrase) and it's simply astounding to watch.I do have one tiny negative, the size of a dot on a sheet of paper: The actors speak very softly so you may need subtitles to watch it, but something like 90% of the movie is in French anyways, so I didn't see that as a huge deal this time.Other than that, I have nothing less than praise fro this beautifully made movie!I should address the elephant in the room that this movie has a WELL EARNED NC-17 rating for it's explicit sexuality. There is frequent nudity(but less than I thought there would be), but that should be obvious due to the plot.To me, the only shocking thing is that this is NC-17 and The Wolf of Wall Street is Rated R, when it should be the other way around! That said, the NC-17 does make sense and I would limit this to at least age 16, personally.Many 1 star reviews on this site are due to the one controversial scene where the woman is sodomized and lubricated with a stick of butter-since that was actual rape to the actress when the scene was shot. I, of course, am disappointed at that, but I do not see it as a reason to say the movie is worthless!To summarize my thoughts, Last Tango In Paris is a masterpiece and if you are interested in seeing this, you absolutely should!

58,dallasryan,Anyone Can Relate to this Film on Dozens of Levels!,10,12 December 2011,"Relating the Last Tango in Paris to everyday life is like relating this canker sore to my lip. I fell in love with Jessica a year ago, but mainly in the environment of my place, in my place, closed off to the rest of the world. If we would have known each other outside of my place a little more, who knows.Pop culture sells everything on a poster, even love. Everything! We get everything packaged to us as a Christmas present or as a movie and forget what sincerity really is. I've had lust in the moment of what I couldn't have or what drove me crazy like Angie back in college, but if she would have really wanted me like Kara did, perhaps I would have blown Angie off too because now she was into me and I knew I had her. So these are the kinds of things we're dealing with in the Last Tango in Paris.Jeanne,(a young beautiful girl), thinks she's in love with Paul(a middle aged man) in the Last Tango in Paris because he's mysterious and dark, mainly because of the circumstances and emotions he's going through from the death of his wife, but Jeanne doesn't know that, she knows nothing about him, him nothing about her.Jeanne can't have Paul and thinks she's in love with him, not understanding that she's crazy about the 'what we can't have' aspect of the relationship and crazy about what they have in the apartment closed off to the rest of the world. She doesn't really know him, she knows the idea of him as a mystery and of him behind closed doors and that he treats her like a crushed snail on his shoe and that's what drives her to him, but by the end of the movie Paul has come to terms with his wife's death, so he takes out everything from the hotel room he was renting where Jeanne and him were having 'butter'.Jeanne arrives seeing all of the stuff gone and thinks Paul is gone forever and she cries and cries believing Paul is now gone forever. But Paul finds Jeanne and tells her all about himself, says that his wife killed herself and says 'it's not over, but we just start over again'(talking about him and Jeanne). Jeanne now sees the emotions in him that attracted her to him were because of his dead wife, but that's all they were, emotions in the moment, and she comes to realize his mystery isn't his overall attitude or his essence of being.Paul tells Jeanne about a motel-flophouse he owns and that he loves her, he loves her! Now Jeanne comes to terms that she's been in lust with him only, of the mystery of him and now that he wants her as much as she had been wanting him for most of the film, she comes to reality realizing that she doesn't want him anymore, that she doesn't want to live her life in a flophouse with him because she doesn't really love him.Later that night Paul and Jeanne go out to a club, the first time they actually go out on a real date, and Jeanne absolutely despises how he acts in public. She's finally getting to see all of him. So now there's no edge or mystery to him anymore, now that he really wants her, she doesn't want him, and she doesn't like who he really is. Life and love and lust are all a crazy game. Whether we want it to be a game or not, the movie demonstrates, in a very intelligent way, how the rules of attraction will always be a game, it will inevitably be a game no matter how one tries to control it.I have many girls I've been with where the situations were like this with them for me and me for them, and they could have easily been different under different circumstances, out in a different environment, and/or if we would have just gotten to fully know everything about each other. Sometimes I hold onto a girl for years, thinking about 'the what if' with her, thinking the 'what if' possibilities because I never fully got to know them when it had ended and probably some girl out there thinks the same thing about me right this moment. But In my opinion, I think 9 times out of 10, if you really get to know someone fully, it fizzles out pretty quick.The passion goes away, the love you thought you had with them you realize was an illusion, the lust may still always be there, but maybe not, just too fully get to know someone, again in my opinion, it would go from 100 to 0 real quick. And how many times do we ever fully get to know someone that we are dating? Not too damn often, once in a blue moon if that.Bertolucci captures the mood to what is going on in every single shot and Marlon Brando gives one of his finest performances(I would say one of his top three performances ever) as the unpredictable, hotheaded Paul. Another performance that should not go over looked is Maria Schneider as the young, the 3 letter word that IMDb won't let me say on here pot, Jeanne.She is the symbol for the young girl who doesn't understand her body and who hasn't had enough experience to really delineate the differences between intense 'in the moment' emotions and true love. A great movie, a movie that should probably be on the AFI 100 Best Films List as well.",Last Tango in Paris
59,alfiefamily,"There's a good movie in here, somewhere.",5,26 December 2003,"The last time I saw ""Last Tango in Paris"", I admit I didn't apprecieate or understand it. I remember a few good scenes, good acting, a horrible score, and a basic lack of understanding of what it was I had just seen.  I promised myself that I would revisit the movie sometime in the future, and perhaps I would then have a greater appreciation for the film.  That was about fifteen years ago.Unfortunately, while I am older and can appreciate some of this film more, I am ultimately left feeling frustrated and dissatisfied. 
There are some wonderful moments in this film. I particularly liked the scene where Paul and Marcel are sitting around in their identical bathrobes discussing the woman they both loved. Brando's scene with his wife is one of the best moments of acting I've ever seen. When Paul and Jeanne discuss their ""rules"" is another scene that shows how great this movie could have been.But there are too many scenes where I feel that Brando and his improvised dialog should have been reeled in (I would hate to see the takes that weren't used in the film). I also didn't like the whole plot line involving Jeanne and her fiance, although I understand why that was there.  In the end, I felt that there were many aspects of this movie that were too self-indulgent and uninteresting. By the time they end up in the dance hall, I just wanted the movie to be over.If someone could enlighten me and give me a better understanding of what was going on, without sounding like you've just stepped out of Film Appreciation 101, I'd welcome a discussion.5 out of 10",Last Tango in Paris
60,brefane,Pass the butter and pass on this film.,2,2 January 2016,"Perhaps the most remarkable thing about this film is the review it elicited from Pauline Kael in the New Yorker. A review which leads one to ask that old question, Did we see the same film? The sex is certainly not erotic. The first encounter, a record-breaking quickie between Paul and Jeanne, is performed fully clothed and can be best described as Wham! Bam! Thank you, M'am. Why Jeanne would find this grieving, middle aged expatriate so compelling and/or attractive must be taken on faith rather than on anything we see or hear. And though Brando's improvised monologues are profane and occasionally funny, at least to the audience, is this how a young Parisian chick preparing to be wed would choose to spend her afternoons, listening to talk about pig farts and vomit? And if so, why? It's like listening to a depressed drunk in a bar. Last Tango is ultimately dreary, tedious and pretentious with artful photography and a bleating jazz score and 2 main characters who are insufficiently explored and who are not interesting apart from one another. The film remains a curiosity, a chance to see a world famous actor and talent exposed though I much prefer Brando in John Huston's Reflections in a Golden Eye. And the ending where Jeanne shoots Paul rather than simply walking away is just as pointless and unconvincing as everything that has come before. And though I put a spoiler alert on this review, I'd say it's Kael's review that spoils the film. What could possibly live up to her description?",Last Tango in Paris

Brando was a great actor here playing a very cold and moody role after his wife's suicide, not that I believe this character was all that different when she was still alive. This film was obviously most controversial. I think its very Cohenesque. This film is bursting with sexual energy and romance, that is the balance it deals with. This film alters the state of the Art form. Schneider is beautiful. This film is as Parisian 70s as they come. The apartment were our two souls meet is as bare as their lives. This carnal dance comes to a brutal stop, when Maria finally smartens up a little. This is a pretty unlikely story of a nameless affair that goes pretty far.",Last Tango in Paris
63,ozjeppe,Simply not very good - or was I just 30 years too late?,3,19 March 2004,"Probably the downside of watching a piece like this 30 years after its original release... What was controversial then, is very tame in today's light, so the initial shock sex value watching this classic (yes, I still realize why it IS one) 3 decades later, is simply pretty much zero. But the rest is unfortunately hugely unsatisfying, too:It's a sincerely intriguing premise with its characters indulging in anonymous, no-questions sex, but it goes from confusing to extremely silly and ultimately just pretentiously rambling, until I give up on their fates; and that's a no-no for any movie. And what's with that annoying film team of Schneider's boyfriend? Brando's charisma and some quite amusing dialog are few assets in this piece from an undeniably diverse director. Would make interesting theater, though, considering its confined setting... Has this been adapted on stage, anyone out there?3 out of 10 from me",Last Tango in Paris

A film about middle-age angst, loss, sex, and death is incredibly involving and Maria Schneider (at age 20) should have been nominated along with Marlon. A 10 out of 10. Best performance = M. Brando.

66,cashbacher,Groundbreaking and scandalous at the time (1972),10,15 March 2021,"While the censorship bounds were coming down when this film premiered, many were still in place. The basic plot devices of semi-willing sexual violence and what were then considered aberrant sexual practices caused a lot of sensation among the film industry and public.
The basic premise of the plot is a simple one that has been used many times. Marlon Brando plays Paul, an American middle-aged man in Paris that is still in deep mourning over the death of his wife. When he tours an apartment, he meets Jeanne, played by Maria Schneider, also interested in the apartment. Even though Jeanne is engaged, she finds Paul fascinating and they begin a sexual affair. Paul has rented the apartment, so they have a place to meet. However, Paul is emphatic that their relationship be completely anonymous, he insists that they do not even tell each other their names.
The relationship remains on sizzle for a while, until Jeanne arrives at the apartment and finds that Paul has packed and left with no warning. Later, they have a street meeting where Paul states that he wants to rekindle the relationship and learn more about each other. The exchange of the personal data destroys the thrill of anonymity for Jeanne, and she wants Paul out of her life. However, Paul does not want that, and the film ends in tragedy.
Brando and Schneider turn in high quality performances, for Brando, he demonstrates that it can often be harder to play an unemotionally rigid person than someone whose emotions bubble over. While the story appears to be based on the ""finding love again"" premise, in fact it is nothing of the kind. Personal relationships take many forms, some healthy and fulfilling, others that are simply space filling thrills. Not only was there controversary about the movie, but even the actors engaged in significant spats with each other.",Last Tango in Paris
67,murtaza_mma,A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: Bertolucci's requiem for unrequited Love,9,1 May 2011,"Bernardo Bertolucci's Last Tango in Paris simultaneously mocks and mourns the human yearning for love and companionship. The movie is a requiem for unrequited love, and a testament to the proclivity of humans to surrogate love with lust when trapped in a maelstrom of despondence, chagrin, and compunction. Bertolucci's purpose is not to glorify carnality as a virtue or to scorn it as a vice, but is to use it as an instrument to authenticate the veritable existence of a dark, ugly, and bestial side of humanity, which is so often suppressed and hypocritically denied in similar works on the subject. Bertolucci's penchant for art is limitless and he uses it to full effect in order to give the movie an aesthetic feel while simultaneously catering to the movie's explorative, earthy, and unconventionally bold motifs. Bertolucci uses his characters uncannily as a medium to foray into unexplored realms of human psyche while unflinchingly projecting them as objects of desire, disgust and depravity. Bertolucci pushes Brando and Schneider to a limit where they are not only forced to compromise their egos but also relinquish their pride, and I say that not as an offence but as an appreciation for his talent as a movie-maker. Renowned film critic Pauline Kael bestowed the film with the most ecstatic endorsement of her career, writing, ""Tango has altered the face of an art form. This is a movie people will be arguing about for as long as there are movies."" American director Robert Altman expressed unqualified praise: ""I walked out of the screening and said to myself, 'How dare I make another film?' My personal and artistic life will never be the same."" Eminent critic Roger Ebert has added the film to his ""Great Movies"" collection.The movie presents an episode in the lives of two loners residing in Paris: Paul, a recently widowed, middle-aged American businessman, and Jeanne, a young, voluptuous, soon-to-be-married Parisian girl. The two accidentally meet up in an empty apartment available for rent, and a steamy affair ensues between the two on strictly anonymous basis. Paul is very discreet about his identity and whereabouts and even cajoles Jeanne to religiously follow the protocol. Paul sees Jeanne as a carnal surrogate for his deceased wife, while Jeanne finds in Paul a lover which her fiancé could never become. The two continue to meet and serve each other at regular intervals while also going about their regular business. Their sexually charged up affair, despite a disconnect at the emotional level, satiates them both beyond expectations, and resonates to the viewer an ineffable sense of frenzy and euphoria that holds him in a vice-like grip for the entire length of the movie. The dramatically botched, anti-climactic ending of the movie, which has been snubbed by critics, still manages to testify the axiomatic consistency of change in packing a punch stronger than the modern-day gimmicks. Marlon Brando gives an inciteful, poignant, tour de force performance as the reclusive widower. Many people called Brando a chameleon, but I would call him a chameleon who hated his camouflage; a prodigy who detested his talent; a narcissist who abhorred himself for being a mortal. Brando as Paul is a cross between a sadist and a masochist. He uses every ounce of his talent to conjure up his menacing alter-ego. Driven by guilt and chagrin, Paul's sociopathic self is a nightmare for those around him. Roger Ebert wrote about Brando's performance: ""It's a movie that exists so resolutely on the level of emotion, indeed, that possibly only Marlon Brando, of all living actors, could have played its lead. Who else can act so brutally and imply such vulnerability and need?"" The scene in which Paul confronts the dead body of his wife, who has committed suicide, is probably the most powerful scene ever filmed in cinema. It not only depicts the complexities associated with Paul's character but also highlights the dichotomy he suffered owing to his dual emotions of rage and grief. Maria Schneider is innocent, charming, voluptuous and pitiful in her portrayal of Jeanne, a Parisian girl whose life is devoid of true love. Schneider, being fully aware of her limitations as an actor, incredibly manages to give a performance that is singular and effective enough not to be adumbrated by Brando's sublime, over-the-top portrayal. The cinematography of the movie is vivid, elaborative, and expressive and is well complemented by the movie's sensuously evocative background score. PS. Last Tango in Paris is a profoundly disturbing case-study of human emotions and is a must for cineastes worldwide, but can only be savoured by eschewing bigotry, prejudice, and conservatism. 9/10http://www.apotpourriofvestiges.com/",Last Tango in Paris

69,Qanqor,Unpleasant,3,28 June 2008,"Maybe I just didn't ""get"" this film. Maybe if I were to see it again, I'd appreciate it more. But I doubt it.There were some good things in the movie. The performances and the cinematography and all the nuts-and-bolts-of-movie-making and all were just fine. The pacing was rather slow, but I've seen worse.And let me make it clear from the outset that I'm no prude, I have no problem whatsoever in the use of graphic sexuality in the telling of a tale.My problem was with the tale.First off, too much of it made too little sense. Having just watched the complete movie, I'm still utterly stumped about such questions as:1) Why did the wife commit suicide? NOBODY in the film has a clue, not her own mother, not her own husband, not her lover, NOBODY. I am utterly convinced that this also includes the writer and director. (some here have suggested it was because she was married to such an asshole, but that's not much of a reason. She appeared to be rather uninvolved with her own marriage and had a lover and all. She could have just left either or both of them too. Nothing is presented to give us a clue to such a nutzo, ugly, bloody suicide)2) Why did the husband CARE? Why was he in such grief over her, when it was clear that it was already a LOUSY marriage, that she didn't love him much, and what's more there was the implication that he married her for her money.3) WHAT money???? He was supposedly a kept man, but how could she have amassed much of a fortune running a place that was one step above a flop-house?4) What, oh what, oh WHAT did Jeanne want? I mean, why did she keep going back to Paul, when he was so obviously abusive to her? Especially after the anal rape scene (even if the rest of the sex scenes were consensual, that one was clearly not. She was in tears.) The only possible explanation is that she loved him, which is reinforced by the whole bathtub scene where she declares precisely that. But if she loved him, why does she *shoot him down in cold blood*???? Is she just supposed to be a psycho chick? This was my biggest ""Huh!?!?!?"" of the picture. Looking back over the film, I don't think I understand her motivation in one single scene.So my other big problem with the film was its whole point-of-view, which I have to presume is the director's point-of-view. And what a nasty, misanthropic, anti-life point-of-view it is. The whole thing is consciously, deliberately, and relentlessly unpleasant:o The people are unpleasant. There isn't a single likable person in the whole thing. You occasionally feel some sympathy for some of them (Paul over his suicide wife, Jeanne when Paul is being particularly abusive), but on the whole they are very unpleasant people.o The setting is unpleasant. Paris is one of the most beautiful cities on Earth, but the director has gone out of his way to make it ugly.o The sex is unpleasant. Sex is one of the most beautiful experiences life has to offer, but the director has gone out of his way to make it ugly.o Life itself is unpleasant. Notice that there is only *one* character in the whole movie who is actually happy, and that's the shallow movie-maker boyfriend. EVERYBODY else is miserable: Paul, Jeanne, implicitly the suicide-wife, the wife's lover, the wife's mother... hell, even the hooker and her almost-client. NOBODY finds joy in love, nobody finds joy in sex, nobody finds joy in anything. Paul leaves behind a long trail of previous careers that he clearly found no joy in. Jeanne has a chance to be a movie star and finds no joy in it.In short, the movie-maker here seems to have a very grim view of life which he is projecting to us here. Someone else here described it as ""existential"" and perhaps that is correct (existentialism never did make much sense to me). And I guess some people think that makes it ""profound"" or ""genius"" or something. Well, not me. I don't happen to believe that life is misery and everyone is neurotic. That has not been my experience, and I reject such a world-view vociferously.So in the end, I gave it three stars: one for the scene with the wife's corpse, one for the cinematography, and one for the exceedingly pleasant to look at naked Maria Schneider. {For all the talk about how ""erotic"" this movie was supposed to be, the only part I found at all erotic were the scenes where she's casually hanging out in the apartment naked (such as the scene at the sink). I didn't find the sex scenes erotic at all, just, as I said, unpleasant. And let me second the comment someone made about how refreshing it was to see her full garden of hair, rather than today's overindulgence in shaving.}In summation, when the movie was over, I had strong feelings. Feelings of depression, confusion, disappointment, and ennui. These are decidedly *not* the things I want to feel at the end of a movie.",Last Tango in Paris
70,robert-259-28954,The sex wouldn't even raise an eyebrow today.,9,7 October 2017,"I never watched this film when it came out, but even after 45-years I can vividly recall all of the sexual hoopla and controversy it stirred up, often to a fever pitch. So this year, in 2017, I finally decided to watch it, and although the sex scenes were lusty, today they probably wouldn't have even raised an eyebrow. That's how far we've come, or digressed, depending on your point of view. In any event, I feel extremely sorry for the ""slings and arrows of outrageous fortune"" that the young Maria Schneider must have suffered as a result of a scene that wasn't even scripted, that Brando suddenly made her perform on the spur of the moment. The film was even better because Brando explored hidden depths that even this superb thespian had never explored, a gift to all who love and admire his innate gifts. This was a superbly crafted film, and again, should be viewed in the context of that greatness, not based or condemned on the sole basis of a single scene, regardless of how disturbing or graphic.

71,lhhung_himself,Viewed from a completely different perspective 25 years later...,6,25 August 2007,"I first saw this film as a university student in the early 80's. Those were the days before VHS (don't even talk internet) made porn a staple. Back then this void was filled by the ""art"" film. Badly cut versions of Emmanuelle and Last Tango were very popular at the campus movie nights and it was in this atmosphere that I first saw Last Tango. Sure, some of us knew about the art elements, but they were like the articles in Playboy - we came to see the naughty bits. And certainly, the butter scene did not disappoint - you could have heard a pin drop in that packed auditorium which made the boring bits worth sitting through.Fast forward a quarter century. Now being Paul's age rather than Jeanne's, and the naughty bits seeming rather tame, I can finally appreciate the artistry in the film. I still think that Bertolucci overdoes it a bit but I see how the questions of love, trust, reality, illusion, romanticism, rebellion, grief, frustration are brought out. I can now grasp the importance of that special place that only exists in time and mind and how transient it can all be and how this is expressed in the film. It's still not a great film but certainly a good one when no longer viewed through the dim eyes of a horny teenager.",Last Tango in Paris

73,SimonD1900,This is art,9,18 December 2019,"What can I say... This movie is almost a surrealistic expirence. It takes you to another place. Makes you feel and think. Sad and nhilistic I suppose, nothing uplifting here. But also feels raw and true to what life can be, which can give you more than a movie that's only trying to make you feel good, just beacuse it's actually more real, simple as that.It's about these damaged lonley souls that finds each other. They want love, I think that is what they both truly want even if they perhaps don't even know it. And they just can't truly find it. They're lost. Sad, poetic and romantic, this movie, or piece of art, is. And that the film is filmed with such a low budget, almost amateurish, feel, only ads to the rawness and strange surialism. It's just different from everything you see today. And that is one of the unique charms this movie carries for all time.But you do really feel bad for Jeanne, so young, such an unhealthy relationship. And relationships likes this do happen, young naive girl, still full of life but also curious to gain more expirences from life, to know more while still a bit lost and confused, a girl like that meets an older, seemingly wiser and more confident man then the boys she is used too, dark and mysterious. They are drawn to each other for different reasons, and doomed to never be happy, beacuse it's wrong.Marlon Brando portrays something all men have in them, this lonley inner persona, that is hurt and angry about all the cow dung of the world and have lost hope, but still longs for the pure innocent beauty of a young girl, with the desire to do dirty things to her, to own her. He is the sad pathetic self loathing, self obsessed, ""monster,"" that all men have within them to some degree. It's life. It's sad. This film is art, to speak of these deep things.Why is this so good? Just beacuse it does something that many films can't do. In a sublime way, everything in this movie speaks of life in a very deep and inderect way, that you only feel but hardly can't explain. The film doesn't tell you what you're suppose to feel.

I didn't find this movie that good, as it began very slow at the beginning. Loved the scenery and filming locations. I found Marlon Brando's Paul character rather odd, actually and I was not prepared to see him engaged in a few nude scenes with the character Jeanne (French actress Maria Schneider), knowing that she was only 20 and Brando was 47. I was a little taken aback by this. Why would he take on this part, as his scenes made me cringe? His character seems kind and gentle sometimes, then as the movie went on he was suddenly a monster. The supporting actors fit their roles and later on observing Jeanne, I felt compassion for her. After the movie, I felt I wanted to research about this French actress Maria Schneider and according to her bio, she was so traumatized by a rape scene, that she was hounded by publicity and subsequently declined to ever appear nude in roles again.

76,fred-houpt,A complete tour de force,10,1 September 2006,"I saw this film when it first came out and was like most people both shocked and thrilled in equal measure. In those days the sight of regular movie actors pushing the sexual envelope to the limits, as Brando and Schnider did, was a risky and very exciting prospect. While in our current era of complete access to a universe of totally explicit porn on the internet, the sexual content of this film no longer shocks, the emotional impact of this film has lost none of its vigor.There has been much written about this movie and comments from Brando are quite interesting. He said that he never felt so violated as when he made this film, that it made no sense to him then or later and that he would never make himself as vulnerable as he did in the film. He described how he felt that Bertoluci had so manipulated him by asking him to improvise material that went back to Brando's own childhood and all of its pains.....that the making of the film turned itself into a huge and public gestalt for Brando. There is a lot of truth in that assessment. But, in some ways Bertoluci asked and coaxed out of Brando no more than the visceral cords of his being that Kazan got from him in his earliest films. An actors actor, the king of the Method school, Brando knew full well that his best material would be pulled out of him at great mental and emotional cost. That he was willing to go to these extremes in so few movies only tells me that Brando had his limits. He just did not want to endure the pain in such a public fashion, even though he knew that it would create 'acting' on the highest levels.What is important for us voyeurs to remember is that it is not us up there on the screen pouring our guts out, it is another person. While it is easy for us to be armchair critics and say that the actor just read his lines and he withheld emotional input, we have to allow that this actor might not have felt willing to go there. While everyone acknowledges that Brando had no peer when he was acting on all cylinders, that he disappointed in too many films does not detract from the performance of this movie. Another point, although he claimed to have protected himself from ever going through such a process again, I would venture to say that he gave as much of himself in Apocalypse Now as he did here. Apparently he filmed a very long improvised and rambling monologue as ""Kurtz"" but Coppola did not use it in the film. Brando said that he felt it was his finest material and that again he felt himself slipping over the edge into madness while doing it.Now, Last Tango....is for me....a superb European directed power-plant of sexual angst and erotic fantasy. There are so many images that remain. I recall Brando's famous angry outbursts, as they are always so fully charged in all his films....in the scene where he is talking very quietly to his mother-in-law and she wishes his wife/her daughter to have a religious funeral, out of no where Brando shouts ""no"" and we just about fall over from the outburst. It is spoken with such vehemence, rage and hurt but it is not overdone. The outburst comes out like a cannon blast and then it ends just as quickly. This is Brando's total control of his power; most other actors would get carried away and say or emote too much. Brando knew exactly what needed to be done and the result is like a punch to the head. Wow.The infamous sexual scenes with Schneider are still so steamy that I defy anyone to find a more volcanic connection between two non-porn actors in any major motion picture. Brando was just at the end of his slim youthful years and was still very good looking. Schneider is a super hotty whose body was blessed with such beauty. It is very hard to concentrate on the film when she appears naked. But, the sight is worth the viewing.I would rate this film one of Brando's top 5. His ability to produce a character so riven and racked with agony, lust and angst is unparalleled in motion picture history. Schneider holds her own against the great man and gives of herself without holding anything back. Both actors showed great courage and daring in making this rather dark and disturbing film. Overall this remains one of the finest and thought provoking of Bertoluci's. This is a film for adults in the fullest sense of the word and for those who are willing to think deeper than the obvious sexual content.",Last Tango in Paris
77,MovieGuyFunTime,Not About Dancing,7,18 March 2021,"This film (while crude and difficult to watch at times) effectively demonstrates how ""the fantasy can be much more satisfying than the reality.""Two strangers meet by accident when considering renting a vacant apartment. Almost instantly they fall for each other and agree to ""share"" the apartment but on the condition that they are to know nothing about each other.This sets up a fascinating psychology where the woman finds herself increasingly infatuated with the man who, through his anonymity, finds it easy to control her by means of both engaging dominance and passive indifference. She has him built up in her mind to be some kind of idol or god to be obeyed and worshiped. Due to the lack of information she has about him, she fills in the blanks in ways that are most pleasing to or most needed by her.However, as the inevitable truth comes out and she discovers that he is really nobody special and that he is actually a bit pathetic, her image of him comes crashing down. As this happens, he begins to turn into the one that is infatuated with her and can't let her go. The tables have turned as hot fantasy becomes cold reality.This could be considered an extreme example of infatuation based on fantasy/imagination rather than anything having to do with reality. So many of our romantic relationships start this way... building each other up to be the ideal version of what we have in our heads only to find out later that we were wrong and are unwilling or unable to deal with the reality that emerges. The joy is brought on by our desire and imagination but our pain comes from eventually having to confront the fact that it was all just an elaborate self-delusion.""Tango"" is a very ""engaging"" and provocative film. Much like a 2 hour train wreck that you can't stop looking at though part of you insists you should turn away. This is not a film for the squeamish.

It was also a film that felt like I couldn't give justice to without feeling mentally ""ready"" and mature to interpret and accept the film the way it might be intended. While the film had its incredible moments, I was ultimately disappointed with the experience.First and obviously, Brando is phenomenal. Done.Second, there are moments of pure erotic steam and emotional epicness but these moments don't seem to last as long as necessary and they don't feel incredibly significant to the overall film's theme and arc. It's difficult to pinpoint what the film was really trying to explore and say due to an imbalance in tone from scene to scene. One scene where the two leads talk to each other for a while really hit home but there were too many moments of confusing actions that made it difficult to understand who theses characters actually were.Technically, I thought the editing was all over the place and the score often beats the audience over the head with one singular emotion without any nuance. Cinematography, for the most part, was mesmerizing but there were some blatant technical errors in sound recording and mixing.The more I also learn about the director and the behind-the-scenes, the more the film doesn't sit right with me. It takes from an opinion of grand and mysterious eroticism to pathetic and nonsensical selfish filmmaking that did more harm than good.

Therefore, I recently rented it with some trepidation, expecting a 2-hour porno. What I watched instead was an unexpectedly powerful, gripping, and frank depiction of one man's ultimate psychological defeat. Brando looks fabulous in this movie. He is past the coiled animalism of ""Streetcar"", but still far from the bloated decadence of ""Apocalypse"". His physicality dominates the screen, with his powerful frame, his still-unwrinkled face, the wispy hair, and his voice. He is the anti-Pacino, speaking softly and using small gestures to convey the most dramatic moments. He reveals Paul layer by layer, and makes us sympathize with this character, who could have been a cardboard monster if played by a lesser actor.                 **** ""SPOILER"" **** The scene in the Dance Hall when he finally turns on the charm and confesses his love to Jeanne, it is heartbreaking to see how out of touch he is with what really is happening.

80,jmerlino,"Significant, but overrated",6,25 March 2021,"First things first. Brando and Bertolucci sexually assaulted Maria Schneider. There's no getting around this, and both men should have faced consequences for that. Having said that, I hope the people who gave this movie a '1' because of that are doing the same on all of Roman Polanski's films. Just because the rape he perpetrated didn't happen on film, doesn't mean it wasn't every bit as bad, or worse. With that out of the way, my perspective watching this film now, outside of the historical context in which it was released, shows the film as being about a very, very stupid man. Whether that was what was intended or not, I don't know. I can certainly understand a guy acting irrational after his wife's suicide, but that's what I got. The intensity of Paul and Jeanne's sexual relationship was something that wasn't seen much on screen at that time. At least not in ""respectable"" movies, and I think that the film's reputation has become inflated by the fact that people were seeing a ""real"" movie about sex. And as such, it is significant for being one of the first films in which sex - not just the fact that the characters have sex, but HOW they have sex - is the organizing principle. Brando does a terrific job of showing how this affects Paul. The problem is that as talented an actor as Brando was, Paul is just extremely unappealing. He's headstrong, self-deluded, impulsive, and just not very smart. Whether this was intended or was though of as smart at the time, I don't know. So, in a nutshell, I think that the film's reputation is overinflated because it happened to be a movie about sex at a time when people were really wanting something like that.

However there are a lot of things that for me almost ruin this film entirely to begin with Jean Pierre Leaud whose one sided character does not fit in with the movie's climate at all, in fact every time he appears on screen i feel like i am watching a Truffaut film and that's because he always plays the same character independently of which film he is playing it in. Related to that issue, i feel like this film relyes very deeply in male gaze and wish fullfilment and so the viewer can relate to the rapist, agressive and distant Brando character it has to make the only other two male characters look absolutely stupid. And the same goes to Maria Schneider's character love for him, the only reason why in the context of the film it makes sense is because every other man in the film is absolutely stupid.
The biggest problem i had with it however was how far the film goes to make women look manipulative and irrational as it, in its end, hangs Brando's character in a cross as a man whose only crime was to love too much.
Had it been less unilateral in its point of view , better placed Jean Pierre Leaud and removed the absolutely unnecessary butter scene it could've been really good.",Last Tango in Paris
82,avenuesf,Still an amazing film,10,24 May 2012,"The older I get, the more I see Bertolucci's vision in ""Last Tango in Paris"" in a different way. The film is pretty tame by 2012 standards, and now that all the smoke has died down it's aged beautifully. When it came out in 1972, films were changing; reality was being presented on the screen rather than the Hollywood fantasy world that had precluded the rating system, and ""Last Tango's"" X rating shocked a lot of people. The interesting thing is that it has always seemed to me to be one of the most romantic films ever made, and Jeanne's innocence and idealism is what wins out in the end over Brando's jaded, cynical personality. Ironically, the film seems to be saying that in the end it favors the romantic view of life, and the music and Vittorio Storraro's beautiful colors seem to lend to that even more so. This picture, along with ""The Conformist,"" were to me Bertolucci's finest films, and I've never seen anything else he's ever made that's equaled these two masterpieces. The performances are spellbinding, and the way it merges its two themes and the personalities of the two almost opposite characters is brilliant. As the years have gone by, this has become much more than just a motion picture; it also makes a statement about how films transformed and matured in the 1970's, but still had the ability to portray beauty despite being more graphic.",Last Tango in Paris
83,DrPhibes1964,Brando at his best,10,5 July 2021,"Despite the recent allegations of abuse during the making of the film I still find Last Tango in Paris to be a remarkable film and think it is the best performance Marlon Brando has given. There is a certain rawness as he lays bare the emotions of his character following the suicide of his wife. He is a man devastated by this event and tries to make sense of it and why she did it. We never get the answers; it is sort a Hitchcockian MacGuffin that gets him into the relationship with Jeanne (played by the pixie Maria Schneider). She too is in the midst of a change in her life as she is engaged to a young filmmaker who seems more interested in documenting her life than actually connecting with it. When she meets Brando's Paul all references to the outside world are forbidden when they are in the apartment, opening themselves up as never before. She reveals things to Paul that she tells an alternate version to her boyfriend. Beneath the over hyped sex scenes there is a moving love story about two broken people. The most amazing scene is when Paul sits beside the body of his wife laying in wake. I imagine Brando wrote this entire monologue. It is a stunning sequence as his examines their marriage, his reaction to her suicide, and then lashes out at her for abandoning him. He quickly begs her forgiveness and expresses a desire to join her. It illustrates a certain self destructive impulse that might have set in motion the film's conclusion. Brando deserved the Oscar for his performance. I think it is more personal than anything he has ever done, and, in my opinion, more complicated than his Vito Corleone.",Last Tango in Paris

Troubling because for some reason it feels as though the lead female character is being exploited. It's quite telling, in the film Jeanne yells about half way through ""Last Tango In Paris"" to her fiancé who is filming a cinema verite style film based on her ""Find someone else for your film, I feel like im being exploited"" this is telling, as years later maria Schneider who played Jeanne, told that she believed both the director Bertolucci and Brando were taking advantage of her, exploiting her. Not Brando in a sexual way, but in the way they used her for the film, she fell into drug abuse after, this film is like watching the taking of innocence, watching an older, male dominated, lecherous world take and use female youth, beauty and innocence for its own gain.

Well, don't look much further - if ever there was a film where the score carries 70% of the movie, it's right in front of you. A film where music tells you more than any of the loneliness or tragic personal and social alienation that we see on screen. It's all in the flat and out of tune strings, the screeching sax, the crazy percussion, the raw and wildly erotic sudden key changes that pierce right through you.

88,filmesfodasticos_by_jorgemarin,Subversive until when?,10,24 March 2019,"Curious is the word ""subversive"" that has been the adjective most applied to The Last Tango in Paris.Curious because, 46 years ago, when the film was released, subversive sounded like a libertarian in Europe and a destroyer of good manners in Third World countries. Now, on the eve of his fiftieth birthday, and on the director's death week, the film reappears in the media as offensive or disturbing.But what was, at the time of the launch of The Last Tango in Paris, and is on the rise again, is a real inability to deal with sexual themes, an inability that never ceased to exist, but sounded a little tacky in ""culturally correct"" enviroments.Paul and Jeanne met in a Paris apartment for rent in 1972. For some of these reasons that seem strange but certainly inhabit the minds of many, the 45-year-old man kisses the 20-year-old girl and initiates a sexual breakthrough that just cannot be considered rape by her agreement.From there they begin a relationship with the condition, imposed by the American, that no names or personal details were revealed. The movie is so restricted in this respect that we never knew the name of Rosa's mother, Paul's wife who had just committed suicide.If social intimacy does not appear, sexual intercourse is wide open, potty-mouth and dirty (in a good sense, we might say). Bertolucci leaves the actors free for improvisations, and what you see are moments of pure lyricism. Impossible to forget the metamorphosis lived by Paul, a violent man in a little boy sobbing next to the body of his dead wife.There is also an emblematic scene that we might classify as prophetic, in which Jeanne voices against her fiancé Tom, who is filming her life, complaints about how she ""can not stand being used"" and even ""feels raped"", phrases that would be employed by the actress Maria Schneider later, in the real life.The photograph of Vittorio Storaro and the music of Gato Barbieri frame this work of art.",Last Tango in Paris

91,arichmondfwc,Butter or Margarine,8,31 January 2005,"I'm thinking of ""Last Tango in Paris"" today because Neznaia, a kind IMDb user, asked me to write about it and I promised I would. Now a dilemma. Shall I write as I remember the experience or shall I watch it again? Well I'm already here so I seem to have taken a decision. Butter, that was the key word that pushed crowds to line up outside the theaters all over the world. Over the years the film has been vilified as utter euro trash or acclaimed as one of the best films ever made. I think that the truth falls somewhere in the middle. Bertolucci was coming out of at least two certified masterpieces of political, social and cinematic achievement ""Before the Revolution"" and ""The Conformist"". Tango is something else altogether, cinema veritè photographed by Vittorio Storaro, a revolutionary artistic genius, Gato Barbieri's music and Marlon Brando giving himself totally in one of the most brilliant pieces of self indulgence ever put on film. Within the intellectual coldness of its intentions breaths a stunning melodrama of operatic proportions. As a side note let me tell you that legend has it that in the original script, the Maria Schnaider's character, was a boy. At the time an idea of the sort was too outrageous to even consider. Everybody was very sophisticated but not that sophisticated. Apparently the movie went on with a girl in the part but not even a coma was changed from the original. Now, look at the film again with that in mind and you will notice that everything, as if by magic, makes perfect sense. We are ask to justify Brando's first wild approach to Schnaider was an irrational reaction to the pain, the anger and confusion by his wife death. Well yes, but he is a man, she is a woman, they may be braking a few rules but the basics remain intact, unless, of course she wasn't a she. If they are a man and a girl above the age of consent why the charade of secrecy? Why she's never really dressed like a girl, always jackets and open neck shirts and why they never make love like a man and a woman, usually, do? A lot of fingers and butter and,talk. When they get to the tango scene Brando dances with a real woman while Maria Schnaider monkeys around them. And finally look at the end and tell me if doesn't make much more sense if she was a he. She could have explained everything, embarrassing perhaps I don't know, but perfectly normal. If she was a he, the son of a military man, the thing had an entirely different color. Impossible to admit or to explain for a boy. Their affair is not between two gay man but between two heterosexuals. That's the key, that's at the center of it all. A breaking of rules in the most intimate way. To go against what you have come to accept as your own nature. I may be wrong of course, but I don't think so. I will see it again as soon as I can and if I feel that this memory of the film is merely a product of what I may have been smoking at the time I will let you know. But, somehow, I don't think I will have to.",Last Tango in Paris
92,SanTropez_Couch,"Focus on the dead rat, not the butter",7,8 March 2003,"This is my first Bertolucci movie, and I'm betting if I see his other, later movies I might fall asleep. I wanted to like this movie so much. I was hoping that this would be the one film that would fully indulge Brando, while remaining wholly artistic. But this is more artistic in that Urine in a Bucket movement. It's strange that Pauline Kael loved this movie: it's pretentious, drawn-out and completely lacking in the kitsch she normally championed. But is has sex, one of the two things Kael looked for in a movie.Paul (Marlon Brando) and Jeanne (Maria Schneider) meet in an apartment, sort of by coincidence and quickly have severe, rough sex. They'll continue to meet there and the rule is: no names. They've both got their reasons, made clear to us later on. That first sex scene happens so quickly that it's implausible and clumsy. Hardly erotic or sensual. But that's not the purpose of the movie, anyway. It's really about a lonely man in the pits of despair, but reputed only for its sex. And joyless sex, at that. (There is one terrific sex scene, in which Jeanne proposes that the two of them try to climax without touching.)There is something that stayed in my mind about that first meeting: how Jeanne rolled on the floor after they finished. Maybe she's just a roller, but to me it was as if she was rolling away from Paul, disgraced at herself. But not disgraced enough not to go back, of course. The direction of the film is blunt, and it's got something to it. Never before have I been so distinctly aware of a previous scene as I was when Jeanne comes out of the apartment, and runs toward a train carrying her boyfriend Tom (Jean-Pierre Leaud). Here she is, she's just had sex and none of the passersby know.Scenes open strangely, or under false pretenses. Tom meets Jeanne and kisses her wildly, only for us to discover that he's making a film. The next scene shows a woman sopping up blood in a hotel room. The woman is telling Paul a story about a woman that killed herself. It's a puzzling scene that exists only to inform us that Paul's wife Rosa has just committed suicide, but it's presented in a brilliant way. Brando's work here is remarkably fresh and open. It's lacking the Method quirks that bother some people and his vocalizations aren't nearly as affected as they can sometimes be. His pauses in speech, where he's trying to think of words to articulate his feelings, are nothing short of genius. It's an utterly raw performance -- Brando virtually cracks open his soul and lets us take what we want from it. It makes his great iconic work in ""The Godfather"" seem like a gimmick. This isn't merely an exercise in style or trickery. Brando must have felt a personal connection to the material. (For one, he tells Jeanne his parents were drunks, and Brando's were, as well.)Another scene, where Jeanne lets slip the name of her first love is also wonderful: ""No!!! I'm going to get a hemorrhoid if you keep telling me names."" In yet another great little scene, Jeanne comes screaming out of a room because there's a dead rat on the bed. Paul's vulgar dialogue is great fun. (He likes rat with mayonnaise, and promises to save the A-hole for Jeanne.) It's these simple moments that make the film worth watching. (In one of the scenes with Tom that isn't boring and confused,  there's a conversation of ""pop marriage,"" an in-joke about one of Leaud's mentors, Jean-Luc Godard, the king of all that's pop.)In the stranger moments, however, the film loses something. There's one scene where Paul turns out the lights in the hotel that he and his late wife owned, to scare his mother-in-law, who's there to visit her dead daughter, that shows his goofy psychotic side. After that, Marcel walks by, who we learn was Rosa's former lover. Later Paul goes to visit him (they've got the same bathrobes) and it propels Paul to go visit his dead wife. Brando has many moments where he erupts in anger and emotion (like when a frequent patron, a prostitute, comes to the hotel with a client who runs away and Paul chases him down and beats him) and I agree with the praise given to Brando's acting next to his dead wife, but his most free work comes with his casual mumblings.Jeanne's reason for meeting Paul is that she's tired of her boyfriend's stupid games, but Paul's reasons are more important (and Bertolucci saw them as more important too). In one conversation with Jeanne, Paul says of women, ""Either they always pretend to know who I am, or they pretend that I don't know who they are."" He's angry at what his wife did to herself and to him and he uses Jeanne as a coping device.The infamous Butter Scene isn't so much about the butter at all, it's more focused on, well, the scene. It's a harsh scene, but the most putrid moment of the film comes shortly thereafter, when Paul insists that Jeanne cut one of her nails in preparation for some work her finger is going to be doing. It's completely unnecessary and vile.The third act is the best. Jeanne goes to the apartment and finds the furniture gone and Paul nowhere to be found. So she focuses on her fiancé only to have Paul come back, changed (he wants to know her name!). He takes her to the tango hall and the two dance drunkenly. And the ending, to anyone who's been paying attention, is an obvious one. Even though it's my favorite part of the movie, the ending reveals the movie to be a failed exercise in experimentation. While I do think the film is ultimately a failure -- and it certainly has its share of boring stretches -- I have an admiration for it. It's still daring, to some extent, today, and it's worth watching for those quiet moments between Paul and Jeanne, making faces and naming each other with grunts.***",Last Tango in Paris

95,ACitizenCalledKane,Last Tango in Paris will return to you any thought you put into it...A masterpiece!,8,21 December 2004,"Bernardo Bertolucci's Last Tango in Paris is like any other piece of art; You get out of it only as much as you put into it. Many people saw this movie in the 1970's (and still see it today) as being pornography and nothing else. Others viewed it and took note of Brando's performance (how could you not?!?), and noticed much, much more than a mere ""skin flick."" Personally, I find it to be a very important piece of art. Why? Because it broke barriers! In art, barriers only exist so that they may be broken, and I know that sounds like some ""liberal artsy BS,"" but I think it's true. Artists are always trying to get down to the basics of human existence, and, unfortunately, it's not always pretty. This film, I believe, portrays a few elements of the human experience. Passion is the first. Then, facades, our need to defend ourselves from vulnerability. Also, the film tries to show the circular nature of our lives (things end only to begin again). The passion is expertly exposed through the savage brutality that Brando brings to the performance, as only he knew how to. Many argue that this was Brando's finest performance, and I can see why. I don't know if I could ever pick one performance of his and say it was his best, but this would easily, easily be a prime candidate. In Last Tango in Paris, Marlon Brando pulls out all of the stops, almost abusing his freedom in the role. Yet, this is where the film gets truly intriguing. Is this an act? It is, at least in name, a performance, but, how much of it is a performance, and how much is a stream of consciousness therapy session? I have never seen an actor pour so much of himself out before a camera. Watching it, I couldn't help but wonder, ""What must be going on behind his eyes?"" How can a man reveal so much of who he is, knowing that it is being filmed to be viewed by millions? Brando's ""performance"" forces the audience to question is Marlon Brando the performer or the performance. We'll never know. Perhaps he didn't know. Perhaps that is how he could pull off the monumental performance that he did. It is quite possibly the greatest performance I have ever seen. The fact that I have to wonder whether his character, Paul, is the truth or an image is only testament to Brando's power. As far as the circular nature of things, we see a role-reversal between Maria Schneider and Marlon Brando. At the beginning, it is Brando who is confused, lost, driven mad by the toll that a past love has taken on him. Yet, at the end of the film, it is Schneider's Jeanne who cares not about names, identity, and personal histories. Her life is committed to distance and emotional isolation. Her mind has confined itself to that little apartment where intimacy knew no bounds, except the publicity of a painful outside world. A million questions could be asked about these two central characters. What was going on in their minds? Who was more fragile, the tormented Paul, or the seemingly carefree Jeanne? Who controlled the relationship? Was there control? Was there a relationship? This film, like all other great films, leaves us asking questions, not only about the characters we've seen, but about the characters we portray on a daily basis.",Last Tango in Paris

100,rdolan9007,A film that is far from a classic it is considered by some to be- and containing a very unpleasant sex scene that could be classed as rape today.,4,17 November 2016,"This is a seventies film that is unsure of what it is meant to be and what it becomes as a result is probably just soft pornography(with one very unpleasant exception), mixed in with a little bit of satire, some meandering reflections on childhood, and having a muted incidental dark edge to it.The combination of sex in relationship to death however oblique was probably made controversial more by the amount of nudity on show (by the woman of course). Yet the downbeat cinematography, the sparse locations, the lack of empathetic characters make this a bleak and uninvolving film. No amount of sex or nudity makes this film interesting, despite trying its best to do so.It really is a disappointment, not a terrible film, and not a film without odd moments of humour either. The ballroom scene near the end where the films title is directly referenced is actually funny, particularly the outraged judges who are appalled by the frivolous dancing of Brando and his young partner Maria Schneider.The film does try to create a darkness which doesn't quite work. Brando's unfaithful wife is shown to have killed herself and he embarks on a very cold detached affair with Maria Schneider's character. It is exploring a very dysfunctional relationship, but because you don't really care about the characters, the darkness in the film appears as an after thought.It is a challenging role for Brando but perhaps because he can be quite a complicated and aloof actor anyway, there is simply not enough warmth in this role from him to make you care about the character.Maria Schneider unfortunately does not get much more of a role then to be completely naked. There is a side story showing her making a true life documentary with her director boyfriend. It is meant as parody, but you still don't care about her character and it further distracts from the darkness of the main plot-line.There are genuinely controversial elements today a modern audience should find very uncomfortable. One of the sex scenes which might have been seen by some as acceptable in the seventies, would almost certainly be seen as non-consensual sex and therefore rape in today's courts.Therefore this film is a extremely disappointing on a number of levels. What might have been a very interesting and truly great film is seen to condone rape because it does not challenge the man over his actions, or explore the affects on her of that rape. A far less serious disappointment is that the acting does not engage you. It's a film that is a creaky, often pretentious piece, and probably (with one nasty exception) not much more than soft pornography.",Last Tango in Paris

It goes to show why few film critics are taken seriously these days, and it marks the decline of the art film. This film has been hailed as a great erotic masterpiece ... erotic? How about lurid, boring, stupid. The characters are unbelievable perverted fiends.

I have not been a film critic for 20 years (I'm not even 19, the age Maria Schneider was when she played Jeanne). I have not seen more films than there are stars in the sky. But I can agree that this is a film that is groundbreaking in the ways most people don't expect: it so nakedly lays open the life of a broken man in all his flaws and his pain and self-loathing. The genius is that we'll never know if it was Marlon Brando exposing his own vulnerability or the greatest trick Houdini never pulled.The plot is so simple it borders on preposterous: haunted American widower Paul meets young Parisian Jeanne by chance and together they rent an apartment where they engage in anonymous sex.

Last Tango is not about sex and it's certainly not about butter. The sex scenes were not merely slapped on to make more money at the box office, for they show simultaneously Paul's release, his grief, his hunger, his rage, his last desperate attempt to reach out to another person. Marlon Brando inhabits this so greatly and personally it's impossible to imagine anyone else in this role with the same feeling of release. From the first frame you see Brando it's so unbearably evident that his face, scarred with age, tells a thousand stories of loneliness. Ironically, it's only through sex with a perfect stranger that he's able to find himself again.That's essentially what this story is about: loneliness, identity (or loss of it), and, in a strange way, love. More than any director I was reminded of Nicholas Ray, whose own violently poignant film In a Lonely Place bears some resemblance: both films center on a middle-aged man whose troubled existence is briefly calmed when he falls in love and ultimately ends in doom. Like Ray, Bertolucci frames his film meticulously, with shots though mirrors, windows and doorways to convey a sense of loss and emptiness in the large and cheerless apartment, something of a haven from the outside world and the people who inhabit it. Only inside is where Paul and Jeanne can begin to comprehend the lonely places of their hearts.So much praise has been lavished on Brando it seems unfair to exclude Maria Schneider, whose life was haunted after doing this movie. She's a child aware of her body and her affect on men, but unable to understand why she is in this situation and how she got herself there, and Schneider plays this with such a devastating honesty. But in the end, the film, the audience, and Bertolucci are all more interested in Paul than Jeanne, and for good reasons. Brando gives such ferocity with the simplest of gestures. Usually one can pick the most emotional scene of the film and mark it as the high point, proof of an actor's genius. I suppose that that one scene is when Paul visits the corpse of his deceased wife. First he rages at her, then he breaks down. Though a great scene, every single moment that Brando is on film is a great scene. At once he's insane (I mean that in the best way possible), he's humorous, he's angry, he's sad, he's broken. Paul goes through nearly every single emotion possible, and Brando somehow makes it seem like he was experiencing it himself. Brando told Bertolucci after filming had ended that he put so much of himself into the role that he couldn't imagine doing something as harrowing ever again.He never did.",Last Tango in Paris
103,warrenf_peace,"Great acting, directing - for true thespians",10,29 March 2006,"This film is a masterpiece of emotion. Bertolucci's directing is brilliant, and the acting wonderful. Brando is a great actor. And the French actors are superb as well. Yes, there is brutal truth here - sex, violence, sexual perversion, and pain. The hurt one feels at a seemingly pointless death. It's got European and American flavor mixed with comical bits and some touching moments. If you don't appreciate this film, you are an uptight tool with no sense of the real world. Go back to your corn flakes and baseball and Madonna and let life pass you by. While the ending is almost Fellini-esquire (was Bertolucci going for that?), this is the movie's only failing - it wraps up too neatly, while not being neat at all. For the more mature or sophisticated audience, and a movie I'll watch again & again because it's fascinating.",Last Tango in Paris
104,ObscureFilmLover,Has not aged well.,4,7 May 2020,"When this movie was released, Pauline Kaal gave it an over the top review. The mainstream thought it was too graphic. I saw it in 1972 at the McClurg Court Theater in Chicago. I was puzzled by it. It was slow and not nearly as graphic as depicted.I re-watched it again last night. What a mess! Brando's lines are laughable. What's supposed to be witty and insightful is inane. In 1972, there was no thought as to why a young super attractive women would hook up with a man clearly past his prime and emotionally damaged. Today that is now a very complicated question. Based on the attitudes of the director/writer and Brando, I have no doubt that Maria Schneider was cast for her stunning figure, slim hips and large breasts. She did the best she could with an ill-defined role.As far as the butter scene is concerned, I was surprised as to how non-explicit the visual aspects were. It's an intense scene but the actress was not raped with a stick of butter. Brando coats his figures with the butter and then his hand is seen going between the actress's thighs and to her ass. Now what he does with his hand is unseen but it's implied that he is digitally penetrating her anus prior to the simulated(?) anal sex scene which follows. If Brando does indeed insert his finger inside Ms. Schneider without her prior knowledge and permission, it is sexually assault, end of story. She says it happened. I believe her.All in all the movie is a bore. The most impressive thing Brando does in the movie for a man of his age is flip from a reclined position on the floor to full standing like a gymnast.",Last Tango in Paris
105,Kubrickfan15,Fantastic performances,9,13 November 2020,"Beautiful dialogue between the two leads that is natural, and never feels forced. A must watch for Brando fans, as he gives one of the greatest acting performances to grace the screen. The scene where he sits and yells at his dead wife crying and calling her names, for he will never truly understand her. He will never know why he felt like more of a guest in her hotel, than like a husband. The ending didn't feel forced, and it was very fitting. This acting surpasses his acting in The Godfather by a mile, and is up there with Street car named desire and On the Waterfront. No other actor can display such raw emotion.",Last Tango in Paris
106,arnis12,Powerful experience,10,24 February 2002,"Though time has blunted it's controversy, and the film is best know for its sexual excess (the butter scene) this remains a powerful viewing experience almost 30 years later. If anyone wants to know why Brando was considered one of the greatest actors, should see his performance here. It's probably the last great performance he gave. Vittorio Storraro's photography is gorgeous, playing with the cold Paris light and warm interiors that Kubrick would perfect later in Eyes Wide Shut. I've noticed that this film has been neglected by critics and pundits in the last 10 years. It remains one of the great films on the mysteries of love, how we love what we cannot understand , or have, and in a moment, it is gone,",Last Tango in Paris
107,RaoulGonzo,"""Go, get the butter.""",5,8 February 2016,"Regarded merely as pornography for many and is most noted for two infamous sex scenes (which in all honesty are tame by today's standards). Last Tango in Paris sets out for much more it's an interesting take on loneliness and depression and living in personal solitude. It's an extremely emotional film, therefore I think it's up to the viewer what you take out of it. I personally only checked it out because of its reputation but I found it to be pretty disappointing on the whole.A young Parisian women (Schneider) meets a middle aged American businessman (Brando) who demands their clandestine relationship to be based only on sex.It has been said that Brando gives a powerhouse performance and he certainly gives his all but certainly in the latter half of the film just ends up playing himself. His character is dislike-able (As most of the characters are) if not at times detestable with dialog so crass it's hard to take serious. Although there are a couple of moments in his performance that garner sympathy (most notable a really good scene where Paul lets all his frustration and anger out while saying goodbye to his estranged wife for the last time) which is true testament to his ability.The film seems to drag on in some places filled with uninteresting subplots Like Jeanne's (Schneider) outside life filled with her pretentious wannabe filmmaker lover which is rather dull and at times tedious.Last Tango didn't necessarily do it for me but I can't say it was without merit, an Art-house picture interesting because of its historical notoriety but its overlong and at times dull in places.",Last Tango in Paris
108,thegreatshonen,"Cool look at sexual relationships, with awesome role by Marlon Brando",9,12 November 2012,"This movie was controversial then, and if I showed it to some people nowadays it'd be controversial now. Bernardo Bertolucci's Last Tango in Paris is essentially his dream of going to Paris and meeting a random woman who'd he'd have sex with and never know her name. This movie is beautiful to look at and watch. Marlon Brando's acting was outstanding and same with Maria Schneider. The plot drags at moments and most of the development between me comes toward the end with its epic conclusion. They're so much influence you feel from French new wave films, but it lacks some of their clarity. The Film is graphic with its sexual content but it does not take away from the artfulness of the movie. Overall, it's a nice movie with outstanding acting from Brando and beautiful look to it but it suffers from some slow pacing. Overall Good film if you can appreciate the beauty of it. 7/10",Last Tango in Paris
109,haasxaar,Maria Schneider's face summarises this film perfectly,7,15 December 2005,"Schneider's looks can dutifully encapsulate my true emotions to this film. Occasionally she looks sexy and encaptivating, other times she can look too pale and a little bland. That's exactly how Bertolucci's helping of sexual cravings had me feeling after this film.Habitually, Bertolucci's work eclipses genius - he is one of the few directors in world cinema that has an eye for definitive detail. He can capture such beautiful images, with such great vision, emotion, colour and panache that the viewer's sentiments are guided like few others in film-making. Like aforementioned, Schneider's face would be the perfect simile for this particular film. One scene the viewer is startled by the raw depth of the film, although slightly troubled by the explicit sex, but then all the viewer is treated to in the next scene is a terse and awkward moment which seems to have no correlation with the one that preceded it.Naturally Brando's performance did help boost this film greatly, but that seems the film's very weakness - whenever he is off-camera it seems to struggle too much, it loses its power and prestige and becomes a little incoherent. This film undoubtedly has some powerful and poignant scenes that really can convey genuine sentiment and exude a tangible originality too; but it never really seems to shake off the loss of Brando's presence altogether.For admirers of Bertolucci its a must, but for more neutral cineastes it would be advisable to have a more cautious approach when watching this film - to enjoy it, it would be paramount to expect this film to be an edifying, not an entertaining experience; its not a frivolous subject matter in any sense",Last Tango in Paris
110,crafo-1,Takes two to Tango,10,6 January 2013,"LAST TANGO IN Paris is one of my all time favorite films.I saw it originally in NYC after waiting three days for tickets to get in. Brando was in the midst of an enormous comeback after THE GODFATHER's success.The hype was intense.Since then I have seen the movie many times and now own it on DVD. When I was an acting student with the legendary Stella Adler I performed Paul's monologue to his dead wife in her scene study class. Ms. Adler, who had essentially discovered Marlon Brando, had not seen the movie and was nervous about its content and vulgarity, but she wept during the monologue and I knew I struck a note.Few movies in my life time have had such an emotional impact. When I first saw it I so related to Paul's desolation and nihilism but as time went on I could also feel empathy and obtain understanding with his counterpart--Jeanne. I thought Maria Schneider was amazing as a foil to Brando. There are not many actresses who could have pulled it off half as well as she did.Greatness often includes tragedy and tragedy must always include death. This movie is sometimes an ode to sexual abandon but it also is a memo to death--both suicide and murder.The haunting jazzy soundtrack and improvised flavor give this film a realistic touch. We believe it from first to last. Jeanne is swept away into an affair with a broken middle aged man and just as she revives him, she rejects him.I love the photography too with its brown/yellow tones and shadows. Sometimes it is creepy and repulsive and sometimes it is silly and fun.Over the years, I think it holds up and is worth a multitude of viewings. This is one that will stay with you for a long time. It's not for the car chase and explosion crowd. This chase is an internal explosion that reverberates through and through.See it, by all means.",Last Tango in Paris

These are the adult relationships we learned.  We see them acted out in various versions around us, over and over again.  The film is great in showing the dynamics of the human psyche being pretty screwed up because of cultural influences.  Brando becomes the man who uses Schneider's character and then shows his hidden vulnerability; Schneider is pretty good at playing the spoilt rich brat who's touched more than she wants to be, but hard at the core anyway.  That's everyone we know.Shows how common misery is in all 'western societies'; nice cinematography all the dark sets and semi-gloomy atmospheres reflect very nicely the human themes of the film.A classic.",Last Tango in Paris

Marlon Brando is about as sexy as anyone can be and this is an old movie! Maria Schneider is awesome as she plays many levels of Jeanne being physically and psychologically seduced by the quirky character, Marlon Brando. The camera keeps jumping from present, past and insinuations of very past of Brando's character, Paul. What a movie! a must see! Secrets are revealed as the movie slowly creeps on. The scenes are dark and drab with no glory of anything luxurious of Paris life. As the movie flashes from past and present, the untold story unfolds. In the middle of this is Jeanne's quirky boyfriend/fiancé trying to make a fantasy movie/documentary of their life layered on top of the other life she is experiencing with Brando. Amazing how the puzzle pieces slowly snap together, and you, the viewer, finally see the entire picture for what its all about.

Then at a Film Co-op screening in college. Once more at the Thalia Theater in NYC. Finally, last night on demand cable.The sexual power of the scenario gripped my young imagination, while later the alienated isolation of Paul and Jeanne resonated as my experience grew. Both these feelings still were there, but this time I perceived something different altogether.Where I had always saw Jeanne's final monologue of denial as a rehearsal for an inquest, now it seemed like an honest bewilderment. A true reaction to a random assault by a stranger that made me think that maybe the entire affair in the apartment was only a fantasy in Paul's grief addled mind.In the beginning of the film, Paul is walking, alone and distraught when Jeanne passes him by. Then he sneaks into a vacant apartment to hide. Does he imagine Jeanne comes to him and submits to intense casual sex? Is their interlude real or a product of Paul's desperate middle aged angst? In the finale, Jeanne is again walking under the metro tracks and Paul now pursues her. She runs home and he breaks in. The End? One of the most outstanding films ever, Last Tango deals with the mysteries of love, sex, death, age, communication and dissipation at a level rarely attempted.Brando admitted that after Tango, he never wanted to try that again. A tour de force in every gut wrenching sense.",Last Tango in Paris
115,cwoliver-1,Bernardo Bertolucci is truly a cinematic genius,2,20 September 2005,"Spoilers. Naw, it was spoiled long before I wrote this. Bernardo Bertolucci is truly a cinematic genius. To have written and directed this masterpiece is extraordinary - extraordinary crap. The genius is that he conned the artistic elite with it.The dialog was anything but realistic; the plot  what plot; the acting was on par with an elementary school production; the cinematography would have been better using a hand-held camcorder, for sure the sound quality would have been better; the musical score was actually a Bertolucci mix-tape and was unrelated to the mood or setting of the scenes.Brando. What can I say about Brando? Trite, emotionally flat, two dimensional, and inconsistent all come to mind. I have yet to see Brando deliver anything near an award-winning performance he is alleged to have within him. Brando has an incredible range of emotion; from angry to not so angry. Moody is not applicable as it would imply that he has more than one and is capable of changing it.Brandon, having done his own sex scenes, demonstrated that he was still a virgin. I've seen more realistic sex scenes in legitimate porn (I'm embarrassed that these scenes would force me to use the words legitimate and porn together). This was the first time I'd seen a woman climax in less than 30 seconds, and the rolling around afterward was priceless LMAO. Clearly the writer was also a virgin.Maria, while her performance was lackluster, did at least have a pair of things going for her  and what a pair. The movie would have been greatly improved by having Maria in various stages of undress for the entire 130 minutes. This would have eliminated the need for dialog AND Brando, not to mention reducing expenses on an already-low budget.And last but not least is the basic premise (spontaneous sex between strangers) was unrealistic  but it is a common fantasy of men. In that regard the movie does deliver  just not very effectively. Maybe the purpose of the film was to get women to take pity on Brando and Bertolucci and have sex with them? Just a thought.

After watching it, I'm wondering how anyone can consider this a classic. Sure, it looks good so I can give Bertolucci some credit. But everything else is horrid.1. Characters .... I hated every single one of the main characters. The boyfriend was an annoying, pretentious wannabe filmmaker who ruined every scene he was in. The woman was a pouty, annoying brat who was all mopey about nothing the entire film. I felt no sympathy for her, as there was no reason to. And Brando's character had a few good scenes, but his character was all about shock value, which made me not really care what happened to him.2. The dialogue ... horrid. The attempt to be shocking by having Brando explain to the woman how he wanted her to smell pig flatulence backfired. It was just damn silly, and boring. Same goes for all his other allegedly brilliant soliloquoys in the apartment. (You want me to put my fingers where?) Anyone who thinks this performance was better than his portrayal of Vito Corleone is smoking some good stuff.3. The plot ... there is none. And you can only get away with that if the performances are excellent. That's not the case here.Brando's done some great stuff ... this was just a bad stop on the road for him.

It's been one of my all time favorite movies since I first saw it 8 years ago, and to me it's perfect in every way: great actors, thought provoking story, painfully honest dialogue, great setting and a wonderful soundtrack by Gato Barbieri. So do I recommend it to everyone? No! Unless you want to like this movie you probably wont (ditto for the music). There isn't much tango dancing and it's not all that uplifting (two things prospective viewers might expect from the title and cover!) Other reviewers (and not just on this site) have scoffed at the notion of LTIP being ""art"" and have said it's pretentious and empty. I guess that's in the eye of the beholder; plenty of films try to be meaningful and make a big statement - some work, some don't: it's a thin line between art and pretension and to me ""Last Tango"" walks that line quite successfully, while some other films placed on a pedestal don't.

It is a good movie, but.. is it a masterpiece? Hardly. The story it isn't that great, Maria Schneider is a lousy actress and Brando... well, he has style, of course, but that's all. I understand it was a shocking movie at the '70s, so, I understand why everybody was talking about it, but when you see it 30 years later (or more) there is a little left. Yes, a non traditional sex or love story, but that's all. I read here that in the original script Maria Schneider's character was a boy, and yes, the story makes much more sense that way. All that secrecy and hiding and conflicts seems more real if a middle age man meets a younger man and becomes his lover.

Porn is designed to evoke lust, and that is one thing that these do not do. If you will let it be, this film is ranks among the most emotionally powerful films of all time, and while Brando's performance is key to that, there is much more.

125,feodoric,A tragic voyage into the innermost recesses of human nature,10,2 March 2013,"Many people have confessed their inability to grasp the meaning of Last Tango in Paris, if one assumes it actually has any single meaning, instead of several possible ones, depending on the character's perspective). I had experienced a similar frustration with LTIP. After watching it with great expectations the first time, I was truly frustrated and thought that more than an in-your-face movie defying of any moral authority, it was mostly an overblown case of new emperor's clothes. I did not like Brando's nihilist playing, but this was because I was virtually unable to dissociate Brando from the despicable yet profoundly human character (Paul) he was playing. It was only after a couple more viewings that I was able to tame the scary aspects of that movie enough to start understanding it better. Brando's acting is so overbearing, so incredibly brave, and at the same time, so terrifying that it takes some determination to go past these feelings and start enjoying the numerous merits of LTIP. And I am glad today to sincerely say that it is not some pseudo-intellectual depicting of the new emperor's clothes. Absolutely not, and I can even say that LTIP is an essential movie for our time, for all times. Bertolucci has realized many gems of movies, and LTIP is certainly one his most interesting, albeit darkest ones.I rated it 8/10, however, and this is only due to some amateurish aspects of the movie, which play a little against my pure enjoyment. First, the choice of Maria Schneider to portray Jeanne was brilliant due to her volcanic eroticism, her very organic physical presence and the superb geographic study of her juicy nude body from all saints' hell, due to Vittorio Storaro's expert use of lighting. She exudes the sexiest archetype of beauty, the idealized vision of the liberated young woman who inspired Bertolucci's story, as we now know : perfect breasts, baby face, fleshy lips that invite juicy alcove feats, in short, the ArchBabe. However, Schneider does not convey credible emotions and makes it hard (!) to follow her inner feelings and understand the actual drama unfolding before our eyes from her perspective. All we have is Paul/Brando's towering point of view, which is a lot, but not everything. I don't know whether Schneider perfected her craft later on in her career (sadly terminated too early, though), but in LTIP, the only chord she is able to strike is the ingénue's, and boy! is she ever good at it. But she overplays it and what I see is an actress trying very hard to interact with Brando's character, but ends up always being the naive sex kitten with which Paul could have played forever, instead of developing Jeanne's slow downfall. One is never aware of Jeanne's mental process, of her inexorable progression towards the finale, even after repeated viewings. All curves, no substance :-)Second, Bertolucci apparently thought that for such an experimental and daring movie, there was only one logical choice: the experimental and daring type of actor that epitomized the French intelligentsia of that period, Jean-Pierre Léaud, who probably learnt acting by correspondence, and learning is a euphemism here. I never really understood the kind of fascination that a whole generation of existentialists had for this eternally youthful and ever charming prodigy. The world is divided into Léaud-lovers and Léaud-haters, with no middle ground. Léaud acts either extremely badly, so badly that it gives him a boyish charm and has Léaud-lovers pitying him. Or he acts so ridiculously badly that Léaud-haters see in him the symbol of all the phoniness that keeps the moral authority of pseudo-intellectuals artificially alive. Once their thin patina of intelligence is removed, the living-room philosophers that the whole Léaud/Antoine Doinel persona represents so well appear to us just like the helpless, terribly misguided Jeanne's fiancé who panics in reaction to Jeanne's animal eroticism that is well beyond his artificial universe. However, just like with Schneider, it is very hard to believe for even a moment in whatever emotion Léaud is struggling to convey. He keeps reciting his lines like a monotonous Sorbonne luminary on acid as if the fate of humanity was calmly decided by him, one solemn nihilist declaration after another. So 8/10, 2 points short from perfection only due to two problems with casting. Not bad, after all. This movie must be absorbed in repeated doses. LTIP is a very potent work, and Brando's interpretation of a lost soul slowly devoured by the demons that his wife's suicide has let him invade his existence, is everything you may have heard about, and much more. Simply consider the scene where Brando confesses his despair and his loss to the dead body of his wife: such moments of pure cinema, such performances filled with the most vivid and authentic expression of human sentiments are very rare, and make one realize that actors of Brando's stature are never legions in this world. I was very deeply moved by that scene, and many others, and I had no idea that an actor projecting as tough an image as Brando could reach the innermost recesses of human nature and stir them up with a monologue that still resonates in my ears. But more than Brando's acting, it's Bertolucci's vision, its intelligence and sensitivity which takes the viewer for a voyage to the frontiers between ecstasy and despair, between pure love and pure madness, from incredible beauty to painful visions of how empty human life really is, once any motive for living has been lost. LTIP touches the sublime, the common fabric of all living souls, and asks us the ultimate question: is total, true and unconditional love possible at all on equal terms between two human beings?

127,Muvibuff77,A masterpiece,10,17 June 2008,"I recently watched this for the 1st time in 15 years or so and wasn't going to comment on it, but after seeing all the negative comments felt somebody should defend a truly great film. Bertolucci's gorgeous and stunningly acted drama concerns an American man played by Marlon Brando and his anonymous affair with a young French woman, played by Maria Schneider. They meet regularly in his Paris apartment for their trysts, but he forbids her from revealing her name or any names of any one in her life or past; he does the same. The way the film unfolds, it's at times hard to decide emotionally what's going on, which actually adds to the film's fascination. Is Brando working out his anger and aggression over his wife's suicide on this poor girl? Is it the need to fulfill his sexual desires without any potentially painful emotional entanglement that fuels him to continue the relationship? If so, he certainly fails at not becoming emotionally involved. Why does she continue to see him? At the same time I say this, I don't think this ambiguity is a flaw; the viewer is allowed to make his own interpretation as to what is fueling these characters' actions. Cinematically, the film is fascinating; the stylized flare-ups of music and camera movement make a film that is mostly talk more cinematic. If I have one complaint, it's that the climactic shooting at the end seems overly melodramatic; why, exactly, did she shoot him? The story certainly could, and perhaps should, end tragically but I didn't find this particular ending all that believable, even if it is beautifully executed. Definitely well worth seeing - there's no excuse for missing one of Brando's most deeply impressive performances.",Last Tango in Paris
128,thederf,Last Mumble in Paris,1,15 September 2013,"This is over 2 hours of incoherence, sophomoric dialog, awful acting, and male self-congratulatory acts of rape and sodomy as expressions of love and meaning. Over-rated Brando is as fatuous here as he is fat later on. He has to constantly look off camera to spout the most inane bloated pig crap in cinema. Rosa was completely justified in suicide from a bore (boar!) like Brando. Her mother could not have prayed enough to save her daughter. Marie Schneider of little talent and no underwear should have listened to the black landlady . . . ""you're too young. . ."" The audience is too old for this drivel. If only she had shot him 2 hours earlier we could have caught the winner of the last tango.",Last Tango in Paris
129,bigeyesforbeauty,masterpiece,10,27 November 2005,"I am happy I watched this movie before seeing all the reviews, so I didn't have this preconceived ""sex"" attitude. TO me ""Last tango in Paris"" is a special movie. I can watch it again and again and it will remain as powerful as it was when I had watched it for the first time. To me it is more that a movie. I saw it for the first time some 10 years ago as a teenager and I remember being mesmerized by the special mood that pervaded the whole movie. And those images. Grey Paris, city of loneliness, the lonely figure of Brando, the girl in a ridiculous hat. Then, the sex in the empty apartment devoid of all signs of normality, a strange relationship between two strangers, who have sex and still remain as separate and alienated as two people can be. She, young , curious, full of life, going to be married. Him, old, disillusioned, in the end of his life-journey, tormented by the pain of the loss of his wife who had brutally left him committing a suicide without explanation, without a note. And so they meet in this naked apartment, engage in the sex devoid of any tenderness, him, dominating her, setting the rules for the game where there is no names, no reality. And during those moments he escapes from the world around him, from the suicide of his wife, from the pain of the existence. She is strangely attracted to him, captivated by his power, lets herself be part of this game. She lets him do whatever he likes with her, but she knows she is free, she can leave this empty apartment at any moment.And she does. She is young and returns back to the normal life with her young fiancé. The last scenes of the dance and the chase are so powerful. The old man making a mickey of himself in front of the dancing crowd, playfully chasing the young girl who is visibly scared up into that empty apartment where everything had started. That last scene of him dying on the balcony like a stray dog is still haunting me. There is so much of the existentialist despair in the movie and the final release of that despair is so crude and powerful and beautiful in its bareness.Altogether it is a piece of art so close to the existentialist writers and painters of the 20th century. It is about human condition, about the hell of existence, about no escape. and at the same time it is so full of emotions, of sadness and fear, of pain, and it is so beautiful.",Last Tango in Paris
130,sreearihant,bits & pieces of Last Tango in Paris,10,6 October 2007,"I haven't watched many Marlon Brando movies, only 1. The Godfather.2. Last Tango in Paris.3. Superman 4. The Freshman 5. Don Juan De Marco.This list doesn't include ""On The waterfront"", ""A streetcar named desire"". I plan on watching them someday.Getting back to the topic, however, I'd like to specifically talk about ""The last Tango in Paris"" I just had to write a review for a movie i feel is one of the best acted & directed ever.I'd bought the DVD not for Brando but because of the controversial scenes of Maria Schneider. But, I was blown away by what Brando did in this movie.Granted, this is not a pretty movie in your ""Sound of the Music"" kind of a way. But the depth he brought to the character created a deep mark.THE FIRST VIOLATION: What was meant to be seen as an act of excess was that, but so finely done. Man, the chemistry the duo shared was awesome.THE BUTTER SEQUENCE: Brando applies butter to Maria Schneider. The act is repulsive but their dialogue before this sequence was magnificent.The Somersault by Brando was surprising & powerful.LAST TANGO IN Paris: Brando had left Maria alone and comes back to her in the end. He tries to convince her by childish looking antics but she has slipped away. He then purses her relentlessly to tell her his name (They haven't told each other their names so far!)She shoots him. Then, she says to herself that she's going to tell the police ""I don't even know his name"". Priceless.Last Tango in Paris does not deserve the bad name it has. It doesn't deserve people watching it only for the BUTTER scene. It doesn't deserve to be called PORNOGRAPHIC.Maybe, if these sequences had been cut, the film would've had a wider audience it really deserved. The audiences came, but to be titillated, not to watch a great movie.I was genuinely surprised that a supposedly DIRTY movie could pack so much punch. The actual full frontal nudity shown by Schneider is BEAUTIFUL.It isn't vulgar. It is hard to do full frontal nudity and not look uncomfortable. She deserved an Oscar for this performance.",Last Tango in Paris

Piazzolla would compose for this). I liked the erotic tension between the protagonists and I think that it was filmed very well.On the other side, Marlon Brando's acting is second-rate and Schneider's is almost decent. The dialogue was sometimes very nice, but sometimes it was just funny and non-convincing.Watch it if you like art films with an erotic element.",Last Tango in Paris
132,grantmalf,Brando brilliance,8,22 August 2005,"I finished watching this film only moments ago and I'm still reeling from Brando's performance. I've never seen such an emotional, powerful, intense, yet so natural performance before and doubt I ever will again. Brando manages to cover a spectrum of emotions rarely attempted by other actors. Beautiful direction by Bertollucci as he creates an almost dreamlike state with beautiful lighting and unique angles and framing. I believe this stands alone as Brando's best performance, one that even he i'm sure was proud of. The erotic scenes are anything but erotic but instead convey the feelings of anger desperation and sadness that reside in Brando's character. wonderful supporting cast, but Brando towers above anyone in this movie, and in mind mind just about any other.A disturbing and beautiful movie.",Last Tango in Paris
133,stuart-288,Near masterpiece that would benefit from some cutting,9,3 December 2011,"This film is very nearly a masterpiece of cinema - the central flaw being the disparity between the intensity & truth depicted in the Brando/Schneider relationship and the nonsense that is parallelled in the Schneider/Leaud scenes. Now I realise that that is Bertolucci's intention (the serious as compared to the frivolous), but the latter relationship really is poorly evoked; thereby making half the film utterly unbelievable - which is a great shame because this really is a fascinating and brave piece of film-making. To lose most of the scenes involving Leaud's amateur film-maker would, I think, benefit the film hugely.I'd also like to make couple of points relating to some of the other comments here. Firstly, the sex scenes weren't real. This is covered in Brando's autobiography, Songs My Mother Taught Me - apparently Bertolucci suggested the actors having 'real' sex, but all the scenes were ""ersatz (simulated) sex"", according to Brando. As for the comment that we don't actually see much - okay, it's not exactly pornographic but we certainly see enough of Schneider, with her magnificent bosom and splendid pubic-bush. Secondly, one of the reviewers makes the valid point about why viewers often consider Brando is playing an American 'businessman', but then misses the point where the character's back-story is referred to: the boxing career that didn't amount to much (think of Terry Malloy in 'On the Waterfront'); the references to him being a former revolutionary (ie: Zapata) and to working as a Japanese diplomat (see Brando's character Sakini in 'The Teahouse of the August Moon'); and moving to live in Tahiti (which Brando famously did whilst making 'Mutiny on the Bounty'). These references (along other autobiographical elements referred to within the film) blur the lines between what's true about us and what's isn't which, I suppose,is what the film is ultimately about.One other aspect of the film which I think deserves mentioning is the opening title sequence. The film opens with images from a couple of Francis Bacon portraits - and appropriately so. If ever a film was able to capture the caged nature of the human condition (a key theme in Bacon's oeuvre), then 'Last Tango in Paris' is it.And Brando in the leading role? Absolutely sensational. No other Hollywood actor could have produced such a brutally honest portrayal (one or two European actors might have managed it), but when watching this particular performance, we realise we are watching a very talent special indeed.",Last Tango in Paris
134,PaoloReaper,"Interesting concept, but poorly executed",7,8 January 2019,"Interesting, different, but ultimately pretentious and badly executed.The many flaws of this film outweighs its virtues. The editing is poor, the sound is usually off-sync or obviously superimposed and the stories and messages are unnecesarily unclear at times. The direction is fairly bad and I think Bertolucci thinks he's a greater artist than he is (Even worse than that, according to both Brando and Schneider).On the bright side, it covers a theme widely banned from usage but so prevalent in society and human relationships (Lust; The relationship between sex and love; Dominance; Control; Abuse; Confusion and the need for affection; Loss, grief and memories... etc) and conveys a message that is deep down great (Even if the direction isn't the propitiate).
This isn't a sex film, but rather a film about sex and its many layers and ways, the feelings that come with it and its usage to escape reality and suffering. It's a movie that shows how a person may feel powerful while surrendering to the flesh and dominating someone smaller, but that ultimately fails to control his life or any other one, for that matter. The problem with this is that the idea is not executed to its full potential, coming across as pretentious.The acting is 50/50. Sometimes it seems like an amateur movie, but some other times you can see subtlety and greatness, especially from the exquisite (Far more than that) performance from Marlon Brando. Schneider delivered a fairly good one, too.I write all of this forgetting about the borderline rape of Schneider and its justified controversy.I seriously believe that 'Last Tango in Paris' could've been a great movie, but the production and Bertolucci direction was far from adequate and the film suffers considerably because of that.",Last Tango in Paris

The rest of the cast is also just right. Then there's the cinematography. Vittorio Storaro has never been a disappointment. His dark shadows perfectly capture the state of mind of Brando's character. Then there's the score: hot, modern, but still dark and somewhat mysterious. Finally, there's the script and direction by the magnificent Bernardo Bertolucci. He writes a complex story of despair, actually born from a fantasy. His understanding of the human mind really brought out this masterpiece (which is, in my opinion, his second best film, closely behind IL CONFORMISTA). How, you may ask, can this film be improved? Simply, it cannot. It's no surprise that this piece of art was what practically brought eroticism to the screen.",Last Tango in Paris

142,grahamdhallman,Brando's Most Personal Performance,10,25 January 2008,"There are definitely no ""spoilers"" here and little, if any, specifics regarding the film itself.Excuse me as I assertively declare that Brando is THE preeminent actor since the advent of the silver screen. Yes, at times, much of the 1960's mind you, Brando did waste his talent on less passionate and engaging films. But let's give him some overdue deference for finding greater value and dedication in fighting social ills that came to dominate the mid to latter 60's. Further, if anyone thought Brando was spiraling into less meaning during the 60's, he did give us under-appreciated genius in at least two films: ""The Ugly American"" (1963), a film way, way ahead of its time that foreshadowed the Vietnam War, and the unforgettable ""Burn"" (1969) where he plays the plotting, racist colonial administrator - Sir William Walker - a character that absolutely foils Brando's pro Civil Rights stance and real life principles.The everlasting qualities of ""Last Tango"" are monumental to say the least. Foremost, the film broke one of Hollywood's safely protected doors down and inserted erotica into the Hollywood mainstream, and further, it matter of fact(ly) stamped the power of psychoanalysis (profound in this case) on character development. Brando's performance (Paul) is complexly woven with insurmountable demons swirling with chaotic deliberation that stretch multiple dimensions of fine acting: emotion, intellect, sincere ad libitum, transcendence, etc.. If you've had the enlightened experience of viewing Turner Classic Movies' Brando biography, you then know that Bertolucci absolutely tapped Brando's vulnerabilities, many unquestionably personal. It would be four years before Brando would act again, and apparently he avoided Bertolucci for many years. After the so-called facts of the time, consider the ensuing historical hypothetical. Brando was a year, maybe two at most removed from the timeless, universally acclaimed Vito Corleone performance when ""Last Tango"" surfaced. Because of Brando's less heralded filmography of the 1960's, and the forgettable Nightcomers (1971), many critics and contemporaries were beginning to write off his towering stature, mystique. Moreover, a wealth of new talent, many influenced by Brando, were on the rise: Redford, Hackman, DeNiro, Pacino, Hoffman, Voight, Nicholson, Duvall (I'm sure I've forgotten some). Yet Brando's ""Paul"" and ""Vito Corleone"" cemented an absolute second coming that none of the aforementioned have equally touched throughout their prolific careers. Thus when the above is considered, the time was ripe for Brando to reel off a roll of offers and multiple films on par with his creative bursts in the 50's and early 60's, a golden opportunity to sell out in his terms, minus excess controversy, which always seemed to follow Brando, in order to forever etch his place in the universe of acting. Thank Almighty it never happened. Who's Brando without the enigmatic controversy anyways? Personally, I fall under the minority consensus that Bertolucci's direction, indeed a grandeur accomplishment, smacked Brando square in the soul and siphoned him bare until ""Apocalypse Now"".""Last Tango"" strikes home to those of us who have, not by choice, dwelled in anguish, depression, unanswered questions, all capable of causing holistic inertia, an inertia susceptible only to primordial living where names and their respective histories mean less because the present becomes so vital and worth living for, and breaking taboos, convention, so liberating. I swear no spoiler intended here.The clear giveaway to this film's dark intricacies and overstated immorality are the Frances Bacon paintings aptly used in the opening credits, an artist who clearly shared his deeply beautiful pain through the palette and brush. Thus for the well-informed culture connoisseur, it should take less than three minutes to surmise you're in for unforgettable film that will provoke for years to come, a film which requires multiple viewings, and personal life experiences before further understanding registers.",Last Tango in Paris
143,izm-rjmega,Misogynist Movie of the Moment,7,12 December 2010,"Made in 1972, Brando plays an expatriate by the name of Paul living in Paris who meets a young model in an empty flat in Paris. She has noticed him on the street looking torn and worn from the recent suicide of his wife. Little does she know that these coincidences are the start of something more romantic. But Paul has one rule. No names. Because names and life history only complicate things. Sounds funky but think about how sweet it is when you first meet somebody and how you feel potential there but as soon as the mystery disappears, your romantic feelings go to. Like when a pretty girl takes a dump in front of you. In the 70′s this art house movie sparked controversy for its NC-17 content but the sex scenes aren't provocative at all (its not like he used Parkay). They are probably as we'd expect any fantasy Parisian romance to be- lustful, passionate, whirly.Without giving two much of the beautiful drama of it all away, this movie says a lot to me about what it means to suffer for love and how devastating it can be when that love comes to an end. Brando does his best work in these roles, reminiscent of On The Waterfront, where he plays tortured souls struggling for love against some antagonist or another. And what does this movie say to me about love? What does it have to add to the conversation? Two things: 1. Love is dangerous because we expose our entire beings to it. And 2. Since there's no other way to love, prepare to ache, because love hurts. No matter what you ever think about love, remember first and foremost that love hurts.Paul does his best to create a place where pain free love can exist. It might translate on screen into some kinky sex filled fling, but I get it. The only thing that matters is the freaky love that these two strangers created in their shared apartment. Amazingly, its when there aren't any secrets left that the love begins to suffer. Its so in life as well- its the people who know you the best that hurt you the most. And usually they are the ones that love you the most.Ryan Mega sexdrugsmoney.com",Last Tango in Paris

145,bipcress,RE: LAST TANGO High Art for sure,10,9 March 2011,"LAST TANGO IN Paris is without question one of the greatest accomplishments of world cinema. Not everyone can get or like this film - it is far too uncompromising as a work of art for easy general consumption - but then most of the hard-hitting, groundbreaking cultural artifacts of modern times generate controversy. In fact this is not only a hallmark of such works, but one could say ""it is their job"" to rattle us out of complacency and dogma. On the 18th of July 1999 an IMDb review was posted that states that ""LAST TANGO was never meant to be a love story between two gay men. I really despise when people say that. Why should people believe what someone said in the liner notes for the soundtrack?"" I wrote the liner notes for the world premiere CD release (Rykodisc RCD 10724) of Gato Barbieri's complete score, and I assume the commentary quoted above references my work. The LAST TANGO notes were an immense honor for me and I took on the assignment with great humility and dedication. As for ""why should people believe"" me, well, for one thing I can state for the record that I have never lied or ""made up"" anything in any of my essays, and I research all details and facts as much as is possible. I wrote the LAST TANGO CD notes over 12 years ago and I no longer have on file records of my research materials, however I do remember discovering (presumably) reliable source for the detail of LAST TANGO at one point during development being conceived as involving a homosexual relationship. Can I admit that this information may be incorrect? Of course, and the disgruntled IMDb reviewer may in fact be correcting misinformation. But, as a film scholar, connoisseur, and industry professional do I believe this detail to be true and correct? Yes. If I did not it would not appear in print by my hand. This is all any journalist, in limited capacity as an historian, can do. A final point, as regards the homosexual angle the reviewer in question states ""I really despise when people say that."" Why ""despise"" it? Merely because it may be historically incorrect? I run into film history misinformation all the time, and while I may occasionally find it bothersome I do not ""despise"" it (unless it is mean-spirited or involves bigotry). Such a violent emotional reaction seems to indicate a political or personal agenda. Whether or not Bertolucci ever conceived of LAST TANGO as being a narrative involving two gay men has never invoked in me strong reactions of either disgust or joy. I am convinced it would be a great film with either scenario. Thank you for your time and interest, and thank God for the IMDb! - John Bender",Last Tango in Paris

The script of this movie was in my opinion underestimated. It is brilliant, dynamic and keeps you wondering what is going to happen. Yes , Marlon Brando has a great performance but I believe that the movie is great because of the feeling that the characters give you not cause of the characters themselves.The scene from the end when Maria Schneider says after she shoots Brando: ""I didn't even know his name!"" points out Bertolucci's solution for the ending: nothing happened in the end, nobody remembers nobody!!!

148,vijay-fya,Watched twice while drunk,8,7 December 2020,"Hey, this is my simplest view on the film. Lets get this straight first, its about a guy who's memories and so himself are/is fractured because of his wifes death. He's understood the pain of memory and attachment as it can always be taken away. So he happens to stumble upon a young woman with whom he begins a relationship that doesn't build any form of memory and the basic of memory is knowing eachothers names. They start an absolute carnal primal relationship and even joke about having grunts and shouts as names. Of which his sound would sound masculine and hers would sound feminine. They push this type of relationship as much as they could. Meanwhile the girl has a boyfriend who's way of expressing love is always in front of a camera. Its more for the camera and less for himself. While brandos love or whatever the f that is is so seriously and closely personal. Nothing exists outside their bed while they're there. Nothing. There's a sense of completeness with him but, as amazing and fulfilling it might be it ends right there. He doesn't extend his relationship any further with her. Not to the outside world. And in the end when he does turn around to extend it to the outside world its too late for her. She's come to an understanding that brando is damaged beyond repair and that its not the life for her. She asks him to leave her alone and he proves what a psycho he is. And as it turns out the only way to get rid if him is (bang bang). Brando talks about his inability to have children. Even though he seems to be okay with it, at the end of the film, the act of leaving a chewed up bubblegum under the grill seems like an act of leaving something behind. The want to leave something behind no matter how messed up or unsatisfied of a life one has lived. To leave a mark that we have been here. Listen, its an arthouse film that follows the psyche of a man very closely. It has no singular message about it. But if u just watch it without constantly looking for meaning i swear its so beautiful. Its a portrait of a fractured man and a disillusioned girl just as its shown in the opening title sequence with the paintings of Francis bacon.",Last Tango in Paris

I'm completely shocked at that movie. I was born almost ten years after its release, so of course my amazement wasn't due to the sex scenes but for the artistic quality of the images and obviously, the superb acting. I have never seen anyone act like Brando did in that a movie. Never. And I love cinema a lot, specially author cinema... His performance is just brilliant, natural, emanating from the soul. I began reading about it and then learnt that the greatest lines were improvised. That's simply incredible. I know Brando's work, and his great performances... but this is different. Anyways... I'm writing this comment to show that Last Tango In Paris is simply a masterpiece. I didn't know anything about the controversy that the film arouse, I just had seen The Dreamers and read that Last Tango was the director's best film. My parents told me Last Tango was something like a porn movie. I think people who only see that are blind, but then I understand what the picture meant 35 years ago... Anyways, that's all for now. Just wanted to share some of my feelings. Will watch the movie once again today. Hope I can get through this nice shock soon. Will continue with Bertolucci's filmography, hope he can shock me again!",Last Tango in Paris
150,brunob28,One of my favorites...,10,20 October 2001,"This is one of the best erotic/romantic/psico-dramatic film ever made in history. The combination of sex, drama, personal depression is perfect. Brando incorporate the role in deep. And the perfect soundtrack performed by Gato Barbieri (from Argentina) made this film unique. Don´t lose it...",Last Tango in Paris
151,Booji-Boy,Masterful,8,25 February 2002,"I went into this movie with no pretentions.  I had heard that it was X-rated and that it had Brando, but that was about it.  And wow.  Brando gives one of the best performances I've ever seen on film, and the photography is absolutely stunning.  The plot tended to drag at times, but when that happened, it wasn't boring, as I could just sit back and enjoy the cinematographic eye candy.  8/10.",Last Tango in Paris
152,Milan24,It's...a movie,9,25 July 2008,"This movie is one of a kind, but I don't think it's for everybody. I've never seen anything like it until then, and I was blown away in more ways than one. It's really hard to watch, though, so I think you'd have to be mature enough because I watched it when I was about nineteen and still couldn't understand it. Not just the message of the movie, but the meaning of each scene. It was really hard for me to comprehend then, and still is now. Now that I reminisce about it, and put the pieces of the puzzle back together, it makes more sense, but I still feel as if I'm missing something. I gave it a 9/10 because of the movie's quality and Brando's presence. There was something odd about it, as if he wasn't really acting this time around, as if he was simply being there. It was different, to say the least. Unlike any movie you'll ever see.",Last Tango in Paris
153,kcastagn,weak plot...predictable and boring,4,6 January 2002,"The only good thing about this movie is Brando's performance.  It didn't keep my attention, and the entire plot was so contrived...obviously heading toward a particular direction.  Brando was good, but a little too melodramatic.  The sex scenes weren't ""steamy"" like I was told they were...and they didn't save the movie.",Last Tango in Paris
154,machocarioca,Why this masterpiece isn't among the 50 top dramas of all times?,10,13 August 2001,"This is unbelievable, you're kidding fellows....this is the best movie of Bernardo Bertolucci, the best character of a genious named Marlon Brando on screen, the most sexual serious film in history, a spetacular and now classic song theme and a deep trip in human minds, angry and behaviours....a unique film in the seventies..... You're kidding, sorry.",Last Tango in Paris
155,myollnir,Worst movie ever?,1,27 September 2007,"I thought it was impossible to shot a worse movie than Bertolucci's ""I dance alone"". Until today, when eventually I tried to see LTiP (I was too young at the time it came to theaters in Italy). 90% boring, 5% unwittingly comic, 20% just irritating. The total exceeds 100% because the film seems even longer than it is (I had to quit before the first half an hour, then tried with my remote to FFWD to any decent frame: no way). The only good about it, Maria Schneider was quite pretty (yet far better fully dressed than naked, IMO)and Brando not yet worn-out. But the talk. The horror, oh, the horror! To quote Brando's Kurz last line in Apocalypse now... The acting. The script. And the famous sex scenes: just ridiculous. Even photography and soundtrack were awful, despite they were signed by Storaro and Morricone. What a waste of time. OK, if you're still a commie today - like Bertolucci - you can't be very smart. But there must be a limit",Last Tango in Paris
156,irena_89-1,brilliant!,10,24 November 2007,"The movie is above brilliant. It leaves you impressed for days, and when the impression starts to fade, you watch it again. And again... Why do I find this movie so special? Because it is. It is a refreshment: it can move you, make you wonder, make you dream - of Paris, of destroying passion, of love which is above the ordinary, of places and people you have yet to meet or yet never to meet... It is a movie of passionate imagination coming true. I have to say that I can't believe people see the sex-scenes in this movie just like any other sex scenes. They're not scenes to make people watch the movie and just wait for the part in which Brando and Schneider have sex. It is amazing sex. It is passion. Strange and exotic fruit. Makes you speechless and addicted. But yet, it is bittersweet... Watch the movie, it is a genuine a work of art, a masterpiece of European cinematography, and I also have to point out- the music from the movie is brilliant, jazz, tango... sabor suave y delicioso :)",Last Tango in Paris
157,renato_landi,Great!,10,7 November 2008,"To my mind this is the best film of Bertolucci, it has dense dialogues and explores all of the secrets desires of the director in a very shocking way. Marlon Brando was in his best form and this is the best work of his career. He is himself in the film because the major of his dialogues was created and improvised in the hour of the recording using personal histories of Brando and Bertolucci.You definitely should see this film, but be careful, it will be a shocking experience!",Last Tango in Paris
158,etienneygagnon,Boring to death,1,14 February 2021,"I almost died of boredom watching this painful nonsense of a movie.
It didn't age well I can tell you that.
Bad script, total emptiness.
Way too long, it was so terribly long for nothing.
Not a masterpiece at all.
Bad.",Last Tango in Paris
159,csyoung-3,What's the big deal?,3,11 June 2009,"Why is this a classic? I hated it. For decades, I thought not having seeing it was a lacunae, so I finally rented it. Here's what I saw: Look, look, an artiste. He's tortured by his past. Boo-hoo. Since artists suffer so much more than the rest of us, he must alleviate his pain in extreme manner, like forcibly butt f-ing a young woman. What a bold cinematic statement! Oh, now she shoots him. Didn't see that coming.The fantasy of repeated trysts with no names revealed was kind of interesting, but the movie as a whole isn't. I guess the sensitive artist business wasn't yet cliché back then, and the relatively graphic sex was new, but there's no excuse for being taken in by this pseudo-intellectual movie now.",Last Tango in Paris
160,Tril727,"The greatest film ever made about fear, anger and hopelessness",10,23 February 2003,"This is my all-time favorite movie. Most people get that utterly shocked look when I say that, thinking it's a film about sex and that I must be some kind of perv. Maybe I am but that's not the point. Brando's character does use sex as an outlet for his intense anger but that is NOT the main theme of the film. Having been quietly humiliated by his cheating wife and following her suicide, Paul engages in an absolutely fascinating downward spiral leading to an ending that is totally unexpected yet utterly perfect in it's simplicity. Brando's performance is his ultimate best. Perhaps that is because he seems to be playing himself. That may be true or he may just be such a great actor that it appears true. There are some low points in the film, especially the parts with the film maker boyfriend, but the greatest sequence ever on film is the tango itself and Paul's (rear) view of the entire situation. I cannot recommend a film more highly but it isn't for those easily shocked by sexual themes.",Last Tango in Paris
161,ellieta1987,"Last chance... for reaching true love, for touching a human soul, for getting the meaning of life",10,19 April 2010,"Last tango in Paris is art... is passion itself... it is love and life and death and fear looked straight in the face. So it is surely the most touching existential movie I have ever seen (apart from Bergman's Seventh Seal!). At first, you think it is an erotic movie and besides many comments I would say that maybe it is the most sensuous film EVER -the thing is that its prurience has more to do with despair, with symbolic role-playing, with passion for living and dying at the same time, with an insatiable need for reaching the core of life itself, and less with clear lust (as we see in so many other movies, very dull sometimes). Even the violence in the movie is not the usual violence we see and become furious at, I would say it is the most strange kind of violence full of the deepest emotions, the violence which becomes one with human passion, which becomes the key to explore the mysteries of life, to find a meaning in life and even absolution, however weird or contradictory it seems. And also it is the most strange kind of violence cause it is EVEN ACCEPTED underneath by the other person (of course I refer to the notorious ""butter scene""). Actually if it was not surprisingly accepted by Jeanne,my dears, she would never EVER returned back to him with that passion... So she did not admit it, but she was actually captured by the strong, deep feelings, and reactions of this man. And for me,this has nothing to do with sadomasochism, it has to do with a way of reaching and touching and understanding a human heart however confused or distant or violent it seems. At least, it has to do with curiosity and inexplicable admiration (Jeanne felt about that strange man).Then,as we look closer, we see the great depth of this movie and why it is truly existential:We see pain, despair, loneliness, anger, crying for communion with another human heart from Paul's side. I think he is the clearest character (well,some did not got why he loved his wife so much...well this is not the point and love does not ever need any explanation, he just loved her and that's all) whereas many viewers did not completely understood Jeanne's character and for example wonder did she had feelings for the man? Was he just an enthusiasm for her? A sex toy? Maybe she once loved him? Maybe she still loves him in the end but then why she shoots?? I would say she is all these together!But,well,if one has never been in such a place, they will never understand completely. And I am telling you that,cause I ONCE (at Jeanne's age) FELL IN LOVE WITH A MAN LIKE PAUL!!! I can tell you that I have been in a position very close to Jeanne's so I guess that her character is full of EXCITEMENT but DENIAL (to grow up) and ENDLESS FEAR at the same time. Jeanne is not actually a real woman. She is mostly a ""baggage"",a spontaneous child, thirsty for adventure and passion and drama and even for a REAL meaning in her life (like Paul) which she has never found anywhere (apart from her first love,her cousin..Paul!What a nice coincidence,huh???!) I think the whole film has much to do with FEAR and this fear is always captured in Jeanne's face even when she looks happy and calm.(""u r always afraid!"" as Paul tells her). So I finally think it is fear which let her shoot. Like Paul (who sees himself in her in a way) she had perhaps her last chance to develop her excitement and passion and chemistry with this man into true love so as to find her meaning in life (and maybe she almost did!). But (despite the viewers who claim that in the end she lost her enthusiasm) I would say, THE FEAR OF KNOWING THE TRUTH WAS ACTUALLY DEEPER AND MORE DANGEROUS THAN THE FEAR OF NOT KNOWING ANYTHING.So she threw her chance away and did ..what she did. The mysteries of reality were proved more unbearable than the mysteries of a lie or an illusion. So deep, really.In the end, last tango has everything: amazing, atmospheric direction and photography (if you pause the movie every second you will have thousands of artistically vivid photos like paintings), best screenplay EVER (not a single word or movement is without thousands of meanings!), incredible performances (not only the make-you-speechless one of Brando but also Maria's stunning and courageous one!), endless chemistry between the main actors and even A LIFE LESSON ABOUT PAIN, PASSION, FACING THE TRUTH, LOVE AND... FEAR! You have to be courageous to face and accept such important issues of a human life. Nothing in this movie is shallow, finally. Everything is multi-dimensional and breathtaking and painfully but absolutely majestically TRUE (I am telling you: it HAS HAPPEN TO ME with a little.. different, bitter-sweet ending)! A landmark!!!",Last Tango in Paris
162,fadoria63,Exceptional,10,25 July 2004,"I was in Rome in the summer of '73 when it was being featured, and I refused to see it because of the fracas about the sodomy scene - not out of prudishness, definitely I'm no prude; just because I felt the movie might be nothing more that an extension of a few scandal-laden scenes. My wife and I only saw it in early 1981, a complete shock. Brando at his greatest, with a graceful Schneider to match him up. We left the theater extremely depressed. Later my wife - she has a very acid tongue - remarked, ''An American in Paris, twenty years later.'' OK, might be, but it's extremely beautiful. We just watched it again today; we renew our original judgment. Francisco Antonio Doria, July 2004.",Last Tango in Paris
163,snorkleberry87,Great!!,10,25 January 2006,"This is a fantastic film!! (Spoiler Alert!) Brando's performance is stellar, especially the pivotal scene in which he asks his young Onegin to stick her finger in a certain area. I really love that scene! The Persian landscape is portrayed with a specially beauty. The film explores the darker nature of passion. With its Lolitaesque portrayal of desire and longing between one very much older man, and a young girl. One really gets the sense that this is the aging Brando's last attempt at a sort of love, one feels alternately sympathetic to his character's plight, his emotional neediness, and at the same time quite turned off by this last ditch attempt. All in all a great film, that will speak to any man over a certain age.",Last Tango in Paris
164,peaceoutdreams,bad film,1,8 December 2016,"This film contains a scene where the main actress Maria Schneider is raped by Marlon Brando. It has been recently told that this scene WAS NOT in the script. The actress was not informed about the scene. The director Bertolucci admitted that Brando and him talked about it previously and decided to use a stick of butter to rape Maria Schneider with. Bertolucci claims that did it for the purpose of art. If you do not believe me, all it takes is an internet search. The fact that the director did this and got away with it is absolutely disgusting. A woman was taken advantage of for artistic purposes??? Why would you want to watch a movie where a woman is literally raped?",Last Tango in Paris
