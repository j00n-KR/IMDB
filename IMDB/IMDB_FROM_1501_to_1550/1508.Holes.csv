0,TheLittleSongbird,Much better than expected!,8,5 October 2009,"I really liked the book, it was a well written one and easy to read and understand. This film adaptation does have some flaws but it was much better than I expected it to be. The film looks very beautiful, the photography is excellent throughout, even in the flashbacks, and the music was great. The screenplay is fairly faithful to the book, and is consistently engaging. The performances from everybody involved are very good, Shia LeBoeuf I actually found quite likable in this movie, and Tim Blake Nelson is fun to watch too. Patricia Arquette is given little to do, and while her character was necessary, I just felt that they could have cast somebody else that fitted the character a tad better, though I liked her chemistry with Sam the onion man, wonderfully played by Psych star Dule Hill. Sigourney Weaver looks beautiful, and seems to be relishing her role as the warden, but my favourite is Jon Voigt. He was absolutely hilarious as Mr Sir. My only other complaint of the movie, other than Patricia Arquette was some slow moments in the middle half, where little of interest happens. On the whole, it is an enjoyable and engaging film. 8/10 Bethany Cox",Holes
1,SnoopyStyle,Strange original concept,7,3 May 2014,The Yelnats have been cursed by Madame Zeroni ever since Elya Yelnats in the old country. Now Stanley Yelnats IV (Shia LaBeouf) is sentenced to Camp Green Lake for 18 months being wrongly convicted of stealing a pair of cleats from a MLB player. The cleats had been donated. They fell out of the sky and hit him in the head. Camp Green Lake is a dry lake bed in the middle of the desert run by the mysterious warden (Sigourney Weaver). Tough Mr. Sir (Jon Voight) makes everybody dig one hole every day 5 ft deep 5 ft in diameter. There is the touchy counselor Dr. Pendanski (Tim Blake Nelson) who seems to be the nice guy at first. The other kids keep picking on Stanley and the silent Zero.Camp Green Lake used to have an actual lake with its own town. Kate started out as a sweet school teacher but a tragedy cause her to become a bandit. Stanley The First had been robbed by the infamous Kissin' Kate Barlow (Patricia Arquette). Then Stanley finds a spend shotgun shell with KB drawn on it. Anybody who finds a KB artifact gets the day off. Now Stanley suspects that they're digging for something valuable.It's an odd strange fanciful story. Disney and director Andrew Davis didn't push hard enough. It doesn't have a big enough style. I like the boys to battle even tougher sand swept conditions. I want the audience to taste the sand. Shia LaBeouf holds the lead very well. Khleo Thomas creates an original character in Zero. The pacing can drag at times. The old story of Kissin' Kate need to be streamlined even more. This is not a simple kiddie movie. It is strangely compelling.,Holes

We feel we are actually in a limitless desert."" This is a good point. While the film is packed full of big name actors and that surely must draw in its share of people, the location and filming are every bit as good as the people involved.Whether or not the two parallel stories were necessary, I do not know.

3,lee_eisenberg,some secrets don't go away,8,9 December 2005,"More than just a ""kids' movie"", ""Holes"" looks at how past incidents still affect us today, whether we know about them or not. When teenager Stanley Yelnats III (Shia LeBoeuf) gets sent to a prison camp where he is forced to dig all day long, he discovers a number of things about the camp, and his personal connection to it. Through flashbacks, we learn that a number of things are closer than we realize (you'll understand this better when you see the movie). LeBoeuf does a pretty good job, as do the other cast members: Sigourney Weaver, Jon Voight, Tim Blake Nelson, Henry Winkler, Patricia Arquette, and Eartha Kitt. A very interesting movie.",Holes
4,jboothmillard,Holes,5,28 April 2008,"I had heard about this film quite a bit, I had seen the DVD cover, and it was on a Channel 4 countdown programme, so naturally I thought I'd give this Disney film from director Andrew Davis (The Fugitive) a go. Basically Stanley Yelnats (Shia LaBeouf) is wrongfully accused of stealing some donated trainers for an orphanage, and instead of going to prison, he goes with the option of digging in the desert to ""build character"". The rules are that you must dig one hole a day, dig till the hole is as long and wide as your shovel, and you will get the rest of the day off if you find something interesting. Marion 'Mr. Sir' Sevillo (Jon Voight) looked like he was in charge, but when Stanley, or Caveman as he is now called, finds something interesting, which he is forced to give to one of the other diggers (or else), it is in fact Warden Walker (Sigourney Weaver). Because of the false information of where the interest came from, they dig bigger holes in the wrong place. Stanley's new friend, once dumb Hector 'Zero' Zeroni (Khleo Thomas) does run away at one point, but Stanley soon follows, and they decide to dig in the real location of the find for treasure. In the story there are also flashbacks about the Yelnats family past with Miss Kathryn 'Kissin' Kate' Barlow (Patricia Arquette), but I ignored this. Also starring Tim Blake Nelson as Dr. Pendanski, Dulé Hill as Sam the Onion Man, Henry Winkler as Stanley Yelnats III, Nathan Davis as Grandfather Stanley Yelnats II, Rick Fox as Clyde ""Sweetfeet"" Livingston, Eartha Kitt as Madame Zeroni, Siobhan Fallon as Stanley's Mom, Scott Plank as Trout Walker, Roma Maffia as Carla Morengo and Jake M.

5,blanche-2,filling in the holes of the past,8,4 September 2012,"Shia LaBeouf, Sigourney Weaver, Jon Voight, Tim Blake Nelson, Khleo Thomas, Patricia Arquette, and Dule Hill star in ""Holes,"" a 2003 film directed by Andrew Davis. Louis Sachar adapted his novel into the screenplay.Stanley Yelnats IV is arrested for stealing shoes and sent to a ""camp"" in the desert where the inmates, all teenage boys, dig holes all day. They all have names: Stanley's is Caveman, but there is also Zero (Thomas), Squid, Armpit, etc. The camp is run by Warden Walker (Weaver) but her aide de camp is a man known as ""Mr. Sir"" to the inmates. If someone finds something special in his hole, he earns a day off.The kids are out in the blazing sun digging all day, surrounded by lizards and rattlesnakes. The area is a dried-up lake. It's miserable. And why are they digging these holes? Stanley believes he's there because of his family's curse, and the film goes back and forth in time to show us what happened. The curse began when Stanley's great-great grandfather Elya Yelnats of Latvia forgot to perform an important task for Madam Zoroni (Eartha Kitt). The punishment for his neglect is a curse for all eternity. It appears she was powerful enough - Stanley is in this work camp, and his father (Winkler) has been unsuccessful with an invention he has been working on for years.Stanley doesn't know it, but his family history is inexorably tied in with the history of the camp.This is a delightful, feel-good movie. The holes are a means of discovery, in a sense, a way of looking not only into the past but finding a way into the future. One man's fate can affect another's, as Stanley soon learns, and Stanley's generous spirit forges the way to a new life.Highly recommended for kids and adults.",Holes
6,hitchcockthelegend,"We dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig",8,27 June 2014,"Disney produce and Andrew Davis directs this wonderful adaptation of Louis Sachar's Holes. Miscreant youths are sent to Camp Green Lake for character building, the bulk of which involves them constantly digging holes in the parched desert. New inmate Stanley Yelnats IV (Shia LeBeouf) is about to set the wheels in motion that will unearth the secret of the digs.It's a blender is Holes, part drama (there's plenty of edginess here), part coming of age tale, part action adventure – cum – detective mystery – cum - Western and part comedy, in short it's a bona fide piece for all the family. The narrative, awash with whimsy and enchantment, is triple pronged, and it's with great credit that the three story arcs are seamlessly put together to create one delightful whole. The child actors, led by LeBeouf, are excellent, really bringing life to the various characterisations, while Sigourney Weaver, John Voight and Tim Blake Nelson have a great time of things as the camp enforcers, and Patricia Arquette in a two-fold characterisation, scores very favourably with charm, grace and menace in equal measurements.Mature and intelligent kids films are a rarity, Holes is like a little gem dug up in the desert. 8.5/10",Holes
7,view_and_review,Not some corny kids movie but a movie with substance,8,5 September 2004,"This movie was very well done. It is not easy to tie together different people and events seamlessly to make it one cohesive story, but that is what the writers did in this movie. The writer also did a good job in pulling the heart strings. It is hard not to pull for the underdog, especially when they are kids. There were so many facets to this movie. There was the issue of race in the early 20th century, plus love, sacrifice, struggle, and more. It should not have surprised me that Walt Disney did a movie of this type after having seen ""Remember the Titans"", but still I was surprised.The movie threw me for a loop. When I thought it was going to be a cheesy kids movie with unrealistic event after unrealistic event, Disney turned it into the real deal.",Holes

9,anaconda-40658,No Holes Here.,10,3 June 2015,"Holes (2003): Dir: Andrew Davis / Cast: Shia LeBeouf, Sigourney Weaver, Jon Voight, Patricia Arquette, Tim Blake Nelson: Wonderful family adventure about filling the gap that was deemed empty due to foolish choices. A curse falls upon a family due to a mistake from a previous generation. A teenager is accused of stealing sneakers that dropped on him from above. He is sentenced to a camp where he digs holes. Beautifully established setup followed by a tale of hard labour, friendship and courage as two boys band together as outcasts. Directed by Andrew Davis who has made a lot of crap over the recent years but this is easily his best film since The Fugitive. Shia LaBeouf stands firm as an innocent whom makes the best of his situation thus accomplishing greater character. Sigourney Weaver plays a warden whose motives are not always clear but she has a secret with regards to her nail polish. Jon Voight brings humour and insanity as an overseer who finds pleasure in the hardship placed upon the boys. Patricia Arquette is excellent as a school teacher turn bandit, which adds a different tone to the film. Tim Blake Nelson is effective as a counsellor at Camp Green Lake. Theme stresses importance of putting our lives back together. The Biblical parable of the lost sheep is demonstrated when one boy discovers something that will fill the hole in his life.

10,zetes,A great adaptation,9,29 December 2003,"Holes, the novel, was forced on me in an education course. I didn't think I would like a children's novel; plus, the other couple of books I was forced to read for the class were really bad. But, to my surprise, I absolutely loved Holes. It really is one of the most perfectly written novels I've ever read. I think it has the rare quality that makes it appeal to pre-teens, teenagers, and adults. Everyone who reads it, I think, will walk away a better person. While I can't quite say that for the film, I am happy to say that they got it mostly right. I don't think viewers of the film will walk away as enriched, but they will certainly be entertained, without the side effect of being stupider when they sat down. It is an intelligent story, and it's very well told. I think it moves a tad too quickly. The novel takes more time in developing the characters. And the flashbacks come in and out so quickly that they don't have too much time to register. The interracial romance in the past feels more cliché and trite than it does in the novel. And the ending, which ties together all the loose threads, seems very ridiculous. It's exactly the same in the novel, but there's a sense of the absurd that doesn't quite exist in the film. It works a lot better. I also don't like the multitude of pop songs. I wish Disney didn't feel it such a necessity to sell soundtracks. The cast is across-the-board excellent, from the young kids to the old pros. Jon Voight is especially great. Not quite sure why we need Catwoman and the Fonze, though. 9/10.",Holes

He is sentenced to 18 months of fun at Camp Green Lake. Sadly, the lake has dried up and the boys there are sent to dig holes in search of something. Meanwhile, there is a flashback to another time and era where Green Lake was a lovely thriving town. Anyway, there are lot of interesting tidbits and stories to which the author, Louis Sachar, is also the screenwriter so his story doesn't get lost in the mix of filming. The cast of kids are excellent and there are some memorable scenes in the film.",Holes
12,deloudelouvain,"Wit alot of kids, but not for kids alone",7,20 June 2018,"When I first saw Disney made this movie I wasn't too thrilled watching it because I rarely enjoy those movies. But with Holes it was totally different, it was pleasant to watch, with good acting and a decent story. Seeing Shia LaBeouf acting at that age shows you he already had good acting skills when he was a kid. Jon Voight was to me the best actor in this movie playing Mr.Sir. Sigourney Weaver at 54 still looks amazing and even though she has not the biggest role she was still pleasant to watch. The story isn't too far fetched and is entertaining enough to never get bored. So all in all Disney can make movies worth watching, and not only for kids, even if most of the actors are kids.",Holes
13,siderite,Easy going movie about childhood friendship and overcoming adversity,7,23 October 2012,"You can't expect much from Disney movies, just as many reviewers here remarked, but some of their films are nice. Holes is one example and although you still should not expect much, it's a feel good movie about ancient family curses and children in an unsympathetic system.The plot is that a boy is wrongfully sent to a work camp. He makes friends there and we get to see how his family was always followed by bad luck. Will the curse be lifted and a lot of unreasonable coincidences make us see fate and destiny do exist and maybe find the cure for smelly feet, too? Yup.Bottom line: I had fun watching it, the child actors were reasonable enough, Sigourney Weaver can't ever be too bad and Jon Voight does a rather small role for his stature.",Holes
14,StevePulaski,Lots of holes in this potentially filled piece,6,2 February 2011,"Camp Green Lake's philosophy is ""You take a bad boy, make him dig holes all day long in the hot sun, it makes him a good boy."" Interesting line, but what does it all mean? Holes is more than about a camp for underprivileged youths, its the key to various secrets that the adults leave untold. Saw this on tape (for VERY cheap) because of a recommendation, now I'm starting to give second thoughts about taking recommendations.I had such high hopes for this movie. I've seen very few reviews of this movie that are less than positive or negative. I'm not writing a review that is bashing the film, but I am prepared to nitpick and say why I was very disappointed with the execution of the film. Lets but on our mature faces, and lets take criticism like men! Stanley Yelnats (Stanley backwards, played by Shia LeBeouf) is a teenager accused of stealing a pair of basketball shoes that ""fell from the sky"". He is sent to Camp Green Lake where he must dig holes everyday from dawn till dusk. If he finds anything of suspicion he must report is to one (of the few) camp counselors where they'll give it to the warden. If the warden believes it's something ""good"" (whatever his standards may be) he will give the boy a day off.Stanley believes that the reason he was accused of this is because of his ""no-good-dirty-rotten-pig-stealing-great-great-grandfather"" who cursed the Yelnats generation over 100 years ago. The story is long and odd, but the grandfather named Elya Yelnats falls in love with a women named Myra Menke. Elya befriends an Gypsy women who says that she'll let them marry if Elya carries the woman up to a mountain and sings her a lullaby. Elya disobeys the women, and leaves for a boat to America leaving the Yelnats cursed.Back at the camp, Stanley takes abuse and hate from every other delinquent at the place. Stanley manages to get a kid named Hector ""Zero"" Zeroni (Thomas) to speak for the first time, and they soon become very close friends much to the dismay of counselors. Soon, Stan teaches Zero how to read, and uncovers more and more details about the kid to the point where they run away together. But the true mystery has only begun...Never reading the Louis Sachar novel of the same name, I hear it's pretty loyal to the book which is nice. The film was written by Sachar himself, so there is absolutely no reason why the film should go haywire with new events and characters. I'm sure Louis had the intention of making it pinpoint to the novel, and I'm proud of that.The problem; why the hell was this released under Disney? Disney didn't seem to water the film down, but whenever my parents saw a ""Disney"" film in the paper when I was young, they would take me to see it. Plus this film is only PG. This leads you to believe the film is at a family-friendly state. It's okay for kids over the age of maybe ten, but younger kids will feel totally lost I assume.Which leads to another argument, how is a kid under ten supposed to follow this film? The movie has a number of subplots and flashback scenes, much like The Social Network, a film of much more recent time. With this though, it was almost for me to follow. Imagine a kid in 2003 around the age of six trying to comprehend what it going on.I was really hoping this would fall under the category of ""a true coming of age"" film. But no, it falls under ""an overly silly, cartoon ride"" pretty fast. Over time, Stanley and Zero's relationship grows very brotherly similar to the relationship of the four in Stand By Me, a fantastic teen film. With this, the movie relies on tiresome ""saved by the bell"" clichés where Stand By Me showed life isn't always good. Stand By Me showed the truth, while Holes shows just a very slim realistic portion of life. It does show life isn't always good for someone, yet it shows it in a fictitious way.Here's an example if this is a bit confusing, in Stand By Me the kids had crappy parents. In Holes, the kid's grandfather put a curse on the family. Which one sounds like it would be more realistic? I really wanted to like Holes, but the cliché irony, the lack of character development of the other campers, and the corny and silly path it takes makes me regret picking this one up. I do praise LeBeouf and Thomas for a good all around performance, and Sigourney Weaver has a cutthroat warden. There is not enough here for me to recommend this to anyone, but it did try and wound up succeeded in more places than others. But it's just another film ruined by it's silly lines, and goofball antics. There is a time and place for those type of jokes, like the 1995 comedy Tommy Boy. Not a supposedly heartfelt film like Holes.Starring: Shia LaBeouf, Khleo Thomas, Sigourney Weaver, Jon Voight, Patricia Arquette, and Tim Blake Nelson. Directed by: Andrew Davis.",Holes
15,Robert_duder,Understandably popular,8,17 July 2005,"It is based on a best selling novel but not only that there is a trend growing in Hollywood of making films for teens that are actually more like the reality of teenagers then thinking that Finding Nemo will be for teens. Holes is one of those films that doesn't just make it self ""kiddy"" but instead treats it's demographic more like adults and gives them an interesting fun story with great characters and actors.Holes is the story of Stanley Yelnats IV. His eccentric family believes that because of a mistake made by their great great grandfather there is a curse on the family. Stanley believes this even more when he is arrested for stealing a pair of shoes that he did not steal. Stanley is sentenced to Camp Green Lake which sounds a lot better than it turns out to be. Camp Green Lake is nothing but miles and miles of desert run by a tough as nails warden, and her two rather eccentric yes men. The warden requires the boys at the camp every day in the blistering sun to dig enormous holes in the desert supposedly to ""build character."" It becomes apparent that there is far more to this. If the boys find something that Warden believes is important she gives the day off to the finder of the item. Stanley's fellow cabin mates don't take to him right away and make his life rather difficult especially when he uncovers something very interesting. The self imposed leader of the boys X-Ray takes the item as his own and gets the day off. Stanley begins to think about the item he found and what significance it has. As he begins to unfold the history of Camp Green Lake he realizes that his own family history is closely tied to everything that the Warden is looking for at this camp. Throughout this we are shown the history of Green Lake and everything comes together in the end.The best part of Holes is the intersecting story lines of the old west with the modern day. Love story meets action for the old west segments and Kissin Kate Barlow and her history is interesting enough on it's own. The cast of Holes wins over the film at every turn. The younger actors in the film from Stanley portrayed brilliantly by Shia LaBeouf, to the young protégé Zero played by Khleo Thomas. On top of that you have three amazing senior actors who play great roles....Jon Voight, who is just hilarious and very good in his role as Mr. Sir. The extremely talented Tim Blake Nelson is equally as good as Dr. Pendanski who seems to have the children's' best interest at heart. And then you have Sigorney Weaver who is just excellent as the over bearing warden with ulterior motives to her camp. This is a great adventure film for kids in the same style as The Goonies but actually a lot better. And the best part is you won't be bored to tears watching it because I think adults will enjoy it too. The moral of the story is definitely still there and the sappy ending still fits right in but it doesn't change the fact that everyone will love this film. Magic and destiny and just a feel good film. It's just a good time. Go see it!! 8/10",Holes
16,tabuno,One of the Best Movies of 2003,9,25 January 2019,"28 April 2003. ""Holes"" a movie about a boy growing up on the detention camp in Texas is the first breakout movies of 2003 (April/May 2003) leading the way as one of the best movies of the year. The almost surrealistic flashback style, its haunting collision of past and present, its tale of growing up under the terrible master suggestive of mythic legends all comes together in a tale of good storytelling, interesting plot, adventure, humor, and compelling romance-drama-mystery. Various characters intersect between time and space, a family curse that spans geography, a mysterious link of family misfortune is about to be discovered after torturous trials. The use of narrative voice-over of the boy affectionately known as ""Caveman"" and images of the past splash over the screen in a light spray of reflective musings.Inter-racial romance, prejudice, greed all come into play in a desert of poisonous danger, of unrelenting heat, lack of water, and the spring of eternal hope and survival. While a children's tale, including a wacky Jon Voight as a sadistic hired hand overseeing male juvenile delinquents, this movie captures a larger audience in its romance triangle subplot, its adventure-mystery much in the same way ""Stand By Me"" provided a mystery driven intensity that lured a greater audience to movie screens.",Holes

18,zkonedog,Just A Fun Movie,7,4 March 2017,"I was initially drawn to this movie because I very much enjoy Shia LaBeouf's style of acting. I had absolutely no experience with the YA novel of the same name, so I had no idea what to expect in terms of plot/characters. What I found was just a fun movie that can be enjoyed by the entire family.For a basic plot summary, ""Holes"" tells the story of Stanley (LaBeouf), who is wrongly-accused of stealing an expensive pair of shoes and as such shipped off to a boys work camp. Led by Mr. Sir (Jon Voight) and The Warden (Sigourney Weaver), the camp makes each boy dig a large hole in the desert each day in order to ""build character"". Through the use of flashbacks, however, viewers begin to piece together information suggestion that Mr. Sir and The Warden may have an ulterior motive for the holes.To me, the main draw of this movie (and what ultimately gives it its charm) is the flashbacks that are used to flesh out the backstory of the Stanley Yelnats family and the area where the work camp has been constructed. At first, viewers will wonder what the heck all the flashbacks mean and might even get a bit confused as to how they relate to each other. As the narrative continues, though, the plot lines begin to weave together to form a satisfying conclusion that ""we probably should have seem coming"" much earlier than we actually do.Of course, children who watch the film will be more attuned to the events of the work camp itself, the crazy antics of Mr. Sir, and the jocular camaraderie present throughout. Even for adults, though, there is enough mystery surrounding the proceedings that things never seem juvenile enough to zone out.Overall, ""Holes"" is a fun little movie that can be enjoyed by a wide range of audiences. I'm sure that pre-knowledge of its novel counterpart lends even a deeper understanding to the movie's plot and central characters.",Holes

This work reminds you what it's like to be a child, without going all sugary or being too grim. The deleted scenes featured on the DVD version were truly best left deleted. They were too harsh for this movie and would have taken so much from it. While the abuse was hinted in the finished product, it was not outright shown beyond a certain extent.

21,elshikh4,"The most ""R"" PG movie !",3,1 November 2008,"Should the term Modern Fairytale mean disturbing? I think optimistically not always. We live so ugly cruel world, so the recent fairy tales must defeat the ugly cruel evil. But this movie in specific was so loyal in showing and sinking into its evil characters, and their ugly cruel doings.For instance, the sequence of the lead being tortured by the bully boys elongated for more than enough. The presence of too many lizards, the delicious onion that causes massive farts, and the deformation of (Jon Voight)'s face by snake's poison, all of that gave me too hard time to stand. There were a teacher who became a thief and a killer, a student of her who wanted to kill her for money, and a suicide done by the teacher using a poisonous lezard; so is it a family comedy, or a crime movie?! And with the smell of the bad shoes, the armpit, and the farts; it proves that this movie really stinks!There is a certain amount of nastiness and violence in it. Does it want to be merciless as our life already is, to establish a strong personality in the viewer kid? Or does it relish doing that to be just different?! Both ways, it disturbed me, presenting a new taste for the fairytale that proved to be sour!(Shia LaBeouf) didn't give it good deepness or actual coarseness. Although I'm familiar with the story's kind, but I felt that the events were melodramatic to forced extent, and the whole enjoyment was so deficient. In nearly all of his movies, director (Andrew Davis) enjoys presenting a wronged main character who, one way or another, develops heroic behaviors to reach his innocence/salvation.

22,drqshadow-reviews,Big-Name Casting Can't Smooth Over a Spotty Production,3,29 September 2021,"Railroaded into a sort of kids' concentration camp over a pair of missing baseball cleats, a very young Shia Labeouf indiscriminately digs pits in the desert all day, suffering ridicule at the hands of counselors and campers alike. The big lie is that this kind of hard labor builds character for troubled youths, but in reality it's just a cut-rate treasure hunt that pits the kids against each other, their supervisors and the world at large.With maybe one or two exceptions, everyone in this film is a jerk. Those who aren't needlessly cruel are functionally inept. Even Labeouf's bashful lead character eventually lets the stress and grimy heat get to him, lashing out at the only kid lower on the totem pole before eventually, grudgingly, making amends. There's a flashback story about a wild west outlaw and a lost cache of some sort, a dual tragedy that coincidentally connects primary characters through a set of crossed bloodlines, but that subplot is eye-roll bad, both in terms of writing and production. I can remember after-school specials with more conviction.I'm not sure how this thing drew such a recognizable cast, either. Jon Voight plays up a thick cowboy accent as the meanest of the adults, the only memorable performance of the bunch. Sigourney Weaver pops in to ruffle feathers and look grouchy, but her role is superfluous and shallow. Henry Winkler gets about five minutes to putz around as Shia's scatterbrained father. Patricia Arquette appears in the old western scenes, plodding through an absurdly hammy interracial relationship before going rogue and riding off into the sunset. The plot just doesn't produce much more than a cascade of punishment with limited retribution. It's an effort that obviously wants to be quirky and playful, amusing the kids while teaching important life lessons, but doesn't seem capable enough to pull it off.",Holes
23,dwpollar,Well-played out strange story...,7,6 July 2003,"1st watched 7/5/2003 - 7 out of 10(Dir-Andrew Davis): Well-played out strange story about a boy who gets hit on the head with a pair of  `stolen' tennis shoes and is sent to a juvenile camp where their primary purpose is to dig holes for the Warden(played by Sigourney Weaver) who is looking for lost treasure that she thinks is intended for her family. The boy who got hit in the head with the flying footwear is one part of a family who feels that they have been under a curse because of something that an ancester forgot to do for a fortune teller.  Yes, if you think this is confusing I have just begun.  What makes this movie work is the uniqueness of each character and the way they are explored.  The author of the original book also wrote this screenplay and it shows because he has packed a lot into this 2 hours(showing his pride for his original work) and not intending for it's message to get lost.  The message, I will leave for others to determine by watching the movie.  All-in-all this was a delightful departure for the Walt Disney company despite the fact that we do get the feel-good ending expected from them.  It seems that the screenwriter & director were given a lot of freedom to explore all the characters the way a novel normally would, which makes for a very unique film-going experience. Although I haven't told you much about the movie, I hope I've enticed you to try this one out.  The wonderful storytelling and the excellent cast makes it very worthwhile.",Holes

Tim Blake Nelson contemporizes the jailer as a new age social worker, while Sigourney Weaver is a sexy Cruella de Ville.Not having read the book, I still had no problem following the complicated flashbacks, which do border on silly with many exaggerations of stock characters teaching us tolerance lessons, but are still funny, such as Eartha Kitt's cameo gypsy and Patricia Arquette's sweet schoolteacher turned Bonnie Barrow.The boys in the gang are surprisingly less of a rainbow than one would expect for the situation, but the production design for dry, sweaty Camp Green Lake is effectively evocative (I suppose kids will appreciate the arm pit humor more than I did).

26,Agent10,Not your average kids film,8,24 April 2003,"Typically, ""kids"" films have some annoying quality to it that makes it way too sappy and unbearable for someone over 13. But then again, that's before Holes hit the scene. Sure, it has the very same moments that often times give a kids movie its aforementioned quality, but this film does a good job of staying away from such conventions. The acting was decent, and the uneasy dynamics that Stanley had with some of the other campers was more realistic than what most movies seek to portray. What I especially liked about this movie was the fact that this film didn't try to break your heart or make you cry. The emotional power was a little more natural than most would imagine, kind of like The Shawshank Redemption in many ways (which Holes also has a similar, redemptive ending to it).

30,rosscinema,"Despite contrived ending ""Holes"" is interesting",6,27 April 2004,"Even at a solid two hours this film does hold your interest and it's a credit to the novel that it's based on. Although a bit much for very young viewers this is the type of film that should be made for youth instead of the usual predictable dreck. Story is about a young teenage boy named Stanley Yelnats (Shia LaBeouf) who is wrongly convicted of stealing some shoes and is sent to Camp Green Lake for 18 months. The camp is located in the middle of the desert that consists of a few shacks surrounded by holes. The camp is run by Mr. Sir (Jon Voight) and Dr. Pendanski (Tim Blake Nelson) and The Warden (Sigourney Weaver) and everyday each kid is handed a shovel and they must dig a hole 5 feet deep and 5 feet wide. *****SPOILER ALERT*****They don't know why these holes are to be dug and they only get told that it builds character but Stanley figures out that The Warden is trying to locate hidden treasure buried by Kissin' Kate Barlow (Patricia Arquette). Stanley befriends young Hector ""Zero"" Zeroni (Khleo Thomas) and it turns out that he is actually responsible for the stolen shoes.This film is directed by Andrew Davis who shows incredible patience and care in telling this story and the book that it's based on has such a loyal fanbase that Davis was obviously being careful not to offend fans. Unlike other youth films this story treats it's characters like they are real people and not just cardboard characters put in to just amuse kids. Voight's character is a little over the top but his relationship with Weaver is aimed strictly at adults and theirs is a strange one with odd overtones. My only complaint with the film is the atrociously contrived ending that is just to happy. I understand that you don't want a dark ending in a film aimed for kids but everyone getting rich and Thomas being reunited with his long lost mother is just laying it on incredibly thick! The way that all the characters have some sort of connection with the camp is pretty far fetched also but don't let this sway you from watching this film. I enjoyed the way that this film took it's time telling the story and for the most part the characters are pretty well written. Hollywood needs to make more smart and interesting films like this for younger audiences instead of nonsense like ""Agent Cody Banks"".",Holes
31,Rob_Taylor,Surprisingly entertaining.......,7,25 April 2004,"<spoilers>Yep, I hate to admit it, prone as I am to writing negative reviews, but Holes was quite entertaining. Sure, the plot isn't too complex and there's a (w)hole (sorry about the pun) lot of silly nitpick points that could be made about the script and so on. But, at the end of the day, it did the one thing that few films do to me these days - it kept me entertained enough that I missed the glaringly obvious (in retrospect) plot device that Zero was in fact related to the old seer who had set the curse on Stanley's family. I genuinely didn't get it until he was carrying him up the mountain! Either that, or I'm getting old and senile. Or maybe, I was just enjoying the movie.So the story is a little silly and trite. But who cares. It entertains well enough and gets a thumbs-up from me. I have to say also that John Voight (against my fierce opposition) is starting to grow on me as an actor. He really ought to do more silly roles, I think he has a talent for them. Likewise with Sigourney Weaver, though she'll always be Ripley to me, has good comic timing and sense.In summary then, a good family movie that has a plot but doesn't require you to think about it much.",Holes

""Holes"" doesn't make the same mistakes as one would expect from a Disney movie about troubled teenagers put in a camp. For the first time events are not explained in details. The flashback scenes really do serve a purpose and present several mature topics that may surprise the viewer. I must admit that at first I was a bit put off by the seriousness of the movie. But soon I realized that we had to endure those moments to see the beauty of the story. Besides the story this movie also does a good job of questioning some methods that are used in correctional facilities.

34,blott2319-1,A different kind of fairy tale,7,24 November 2020,"In many ways, Holes feels like it is a fairy tale film. There are somewhat magical elements, there are unlikely twists and turns, the heroes and villains are exaggerated in their personalities, and even the world itself seems to operate on its own set of rules that are slightly different from our own. I greatly appreciated that fairy tale aspect because it drew me in early, and also allowed me to shut down my logical brain and accept that some things might operate a bit different in this film, so I could suspend my disbelief to a greater degree. I can't say that I was surprised at all by the reveals that come later in the film because they telegraph everything that's coming in a fairly blatant way, but this wasn't the type of movie that relied on surprises to keep you entertained. Likewise, I found it easy to forgive some of the shoddy CGI work since they tried to keep it to a minimum and it never hurt the story.I'm always a sucker for a plot about an underdog who has to rise up against an unjust system, and Holes delivers that plotline well. It's easy to root for Stanley because he is so greatly mistreated for no good reason. I also liked that they had a mix of different villains, instead of making them all sadistic and evil. Jon Voight gets to be ridiculously over the top, which allows Tim Blake Nelson and Sigourney Weaver to be a bit more subtle with their diabolical behavior. Shia LeBeouf is solid as Stanley, the protagonist, and it's easy to root for Khleo Thomas as well. Some of my favorite characters in the film were actually Stanley's family, and I wish they got a bit more screentime. Holes is definitely an entertaining and fun adventure. While it's not all that original or surprising, it provides all the entertainment needed to make for a good time that the whole family can enjoy.",Holes
35,sharky_55,It's Yelnats backwards...,8,15 July 2015,"Holes is a rare piece of children's cinema in that it isn't dumbed down or loaded with unsavoury humour. It's extraordinary in it's maturity and much of that is due to Louis Sachar's excellent screenplay, which doesn't dramatically divert from his original children's novel like so many adaptations today do. It posses great wit and humour, but it all feels natural because of some great casting, dialogue and directing which lends credence to the slightly fantastical setting. Camp Green Lake is a juvenile detention centre of sorts, where troubled young boys learn to build character by digging holes every day. Secretly, the camp's ageing warden is looking for buried treasure like her grandfather before her.The main character Stanley Yelnats is just one of the fleshed out individuals in this piece which helps engage the audience. A young and emerging Shia Labeouf plays him with a genuine sense of nervousness and goodwill, even without the novel's defining characteristic of Stanley being initially overweight (losing that and transforming as he digs and builds friendships). The rest of the boys of cabin D are also nicely cast; each are unique and go by a defining nickname. The script doesn't sugar coat the interactions of young boys, juveniles at that; it perfectly encapsulates exactly how they belittle, bully and joke around. Stanley is at first intimated into giving up little favours but learns to fit in with the group; this is perfectly contrasted once another new boy joins the camp. Davis' use of flashbacks is not forced or out of place. Like every scene in the film it is methodically, symbolic and serves a purpose. The different narrative all connect in such a satisfying and thematically relevant way. His direction means some clever revelations and cuts heighten the emotion and drama that is often served straight in a children's film. Stanley discovers the warden's use of microphones and cameras to spy on the entire camp. During a shower, the score turns whimsical as he peers around for any voyeuristic devices, and the scene smoothly transitions to a rainy day at Kate Barlow's schoolhouse. This kick-starts Sam and Kate's relationship nicely as he fixes the leaky roof. Later, as she reads a Hemingway love poem, drops unexpectedly appear on the page. Wasn't the roof fixed though? It is only then that the camera tilts up to reveal her tears and Sam once again has a fix for that. Simply but magical. In the camp counsellor's introduction, Stanley starts on the floor and the camera again tilts up to look up at 'Mom', before the humorous reveal of Stanley actually being a fair bit taller than him. Holes always keeps the audience guessing and never lets them settle into preconceived notions of what must happen next, or what twist is needed, or what a character should do. Speaking of him, all 3 adult figures in the camp and played extraordinary well by their actors. It's never one-bit or predictable; the jovial and sympathetic nature of Pendanski is offset by his very cruel behaviour towards Zero. That manifests finally in a very rewarding escape when Zero proves all his ideas wrong. Jon Voight plays the tough enforcer of Mr Sir, but there's cracks of humour now and again (Once upon a time there was a place that never rained. The end.) and his demeanour turns cruel when the theft of his sunflower seeds is not perceived as important. His nervousness in the final scenes is quite brilliant; Voight paces awkwardly, turning to the side to cover up his scar and trying to avoid being recognised. Finally Sigourney Weaver plays the femme fatale gone to seed, a hint of desperation for finding the long lost treasure interspersed with bits of fake kindness. Holes, despite it's source material demonstrates a lot of growth and maturity in both characterisation and presentation. Each scene drips with information which is later utilised. The humorous introduction of Stanley's family is later the source of their success with the deodorant Sploosh, the name coming from the jar of peaches that Zero discovers as a relic of Kate Barlow's past...and the celebrity endorser is that donor of the shoes that kick into motion the entirety of the modern day plot. And when Stanley carries Zero up the mountain, he finally undoes his line's curse and from then on his luck turns. It appeals to both young and old; never too heavy or cynical, nor condescending or overt. It's perhaps the perfect adaptation; losing none of the charm and originality that the novel holds, but adding cinematic touches which enhance our imaginations rather than spoil our reading experience.",Holes
36,vip_ebriega,Clever story. Witty family entertainment.,8,16 March 2009,"My Take: The story is wildly original and the characters are clever. Based on a novel by Louis Sachar (also credited as the film's screenwriter), HOLES is an easy yet enjoyable summertime comedy from THE FUGITIVE director Andrew Davis, who may seem like a strange choice to direct this teenage-starred comedy (with some occasional support from an excellent well-named cast). But Davis is actually great at putting together this entertaining comedy, building it with laughs and emphasizing such strong performances. The premise of Sachar's book does grate on the screen, but it remains funny and entertaining, mainly because the storytelling is rather compelling.In one of his earlier screen performances, Shia LaBeouf plays Stanley Yelnats IV, who shares an intriguing legacy which eventually leads to a sort of ""family curse"". This proves to still be going on when his Dad (Henry Winkler) still hasn't found the perfect way to keep shoes stink-free. Meanwhile, Stanley (IV) gets arrested when he is wrongfully accused of stealing an important pair of cleats. He is given to options in court: Juvenile Hall or a summer-long detention in Camp Green Lake, which is ruled upon by a bossy warden (excellently portrayed by Sigourney Weaver) and two oddball camp counselors (Jon Voight and Tim Blake Nelson) who orders inmates to dig holes to ""build character"" while also hiding a hidden agenda in doing so. Guess which he picked? One of the main key moments of the film doesn't take place in the camp and the nearly-endless digging, but during the flashbacks where we catch a glimpse of Stanley's legacy, from his great-grandfather's failure to repay the old-woman named Madame Zeroni (Eartha Kitt), who then bestows upon the well-known family curse. There's also flashbacks regarding the mysterious ""Kissin' Kate"" Barlow, who may have something to do with what these boys are digging for. Putting them all together, along with Stanley's life on Camp Green Lake with his new pal Zero (Khleo Thomas) as well as life back at home is not an easy task, and it proves. Instead of the use of potty humor and crude jokes, HOLES has a clever story with some intriguing plot twists and very interesting characters. A gem worth checking out if you've missed it.

40,movieguy1021,Holes: 6/10,6,20 June 2003,"Holes is a wolf in sheep's clothing. It appears to be a simple Disney kids film, but turns into so much more. Of course, that's where it's dragged down: when it tries to be a Disney film. At times it has quality of older films that are PG because there's not much offensive material in it, but at times it seems like a film fit for a Disney audience. When I went into Holes, I expected the script to be mutilated from the book, even though it's written by the author Louis Sachar. However, it's similar to the book, except with both a few welcome differences and a few unwelcome ones.At times, Holes has some very believable, palpable drama. You could feel along with the characters, no matter how undeveloped they were. However, Disney couldn't make a movie that was very good for the ENTIRE movie. Nope, they had to through in some scatological humor, much revolving around a character with the nickname of `Armpit'. Also, the film relied too much on flashback for most of the movie. It had uneven cuts, with much of the time in the middle of the movie revolving around the flashback, with not enough time at the present time. Although Holes wouldn't have worked without flashback, there was just too much of it (and it did a Fight Club: a flashback in a flashback).The plot revolves around Stanley Yelnats IV (Shia LaBeouf). Every man in his family is named Stanley because it is Yelnats backwards. For some reason, this didn't work in the movie. He's accused for stealing shoes donated to an orphanage by baseball star Clyde Livingston (Rick Fox), while they just hit him on the head. Stanley thinks they fell from the sky. When he goes to court, Stanley chooses between prison or Camp Green Lake. Because his family is poor (his father is working on an invention to cure the smell of shoes), and he's never been to camp before, he chooses Camp Green Lake. Instead of an actual camp, however, they have to dig a five by five hole every day to `build character'. But is there some ulterior motive?Holes is a very enjoyable movie, with part drama, part comedy (however crude and PG it may be), part thriller, part action. I liked to go along with Stanley, and the other denizens at the camp. However, there are a few fatal mistakes. First off, Sachar took out the most important part of Stanley's character development. In the book, Stanley was an overweight and teased kid, which helps with his change throughout the book. However, here he's a scrawny kid, and it doesn't help out his character. Also, at the end, Sachar tries to wrap everything up in a nice little package and express ship it to our hearts, while in the book `you have to fill in the holes yourself.' It wasn't that hard to do in the book, so why would movie audiences have a tough time?The acting was good from the adult players, who include Sigourney Weaver, Jon Voight, Tim Blake Nelson, Henry Winkler, Siobhan Fallon, Patricia Arquette, and Eartha Kitt, who plays wacky fortuneteller Madame Zeroni. I really like Nelson, and he reminded me of his role in O Brother, Where Art Thou, although I haven't seen that movie for a long time. Weaver seemed obligated to do this film, while Winkler needed the role. All of them were good. I recognized Fallon as Beatrice from Men in Black, she has a distinctive voice. Overall, I would say Holes is a good movie, but you will like it more if you haven't read the book.My rating: 6/10Rated PG for violence, mild language and some thematic elements.",Holes

If I were to judge the author by this one book, I'd consider him an American Rolad Dahl or Charles Dickens. At least Dahl lived to get more involved in screenplays, and if you think this is just another film vehicle for former Even Stevens star Shia LaBeouf, you're mistaken. I also disagree with another reviewer who called this movie ""Un-American,"" even if it isn't flag-wavingly pro-American.Stanley Yelnats IV(LaBeouf) is a Texas kid who's been accused of stealing some famous baseball player's(Rick Fox) shoes from a charity auction. Henry Winkler plays Stanley's Dad(SY III), a struggling inventor dedicated to eliminating foot odor. He and SY II(Nathan Davis) think misfortunes like this are a result of a family curse dating back both to his Latvian ancestry, and the Old West. In order to avoid jail time, he's given the option of attending Camp Greenlake, which as it turns out is a state-supported ""Wilderness Therapy"" boot camp for kids, and the idea that a kid can be falsely imprisoned in so-called camps that claim to build character isn't so hard to believe. The lake that this place is named after turns out to be a desert, and all the kids are forced to dig holes in the ground. Along the way, he finds artifacts from a treasure buried by a schoolmarm turned outlaw(Patricia Arquette), and begins to suspect that the motives of the people who run Camp Greenlake aren't so pure after all. At the camp, he befriends only one kid, a younger boy named Hector ""Zero"" Zeroni(Khleo Thomas), who's not only responsible for making him a ward of the criminal justice system in the first place, but is a descendant of the very woman who's accused of putting the curse on the Yelnats family, played by none other than Eartha Kitt. Everybody at the camp thinks ""Zero"" is a deaf, dumb mute, until Yelnats talks about why he was sent there. They also think he has no parents simply because he was split up from his homeless mother somehow, and was found as a ward of the state.Sigourney Weaver plays as a genuine villainess, not just a hard-nosed boss as she did in ""Working Girl."" But even she was forced to dig this very lake by her grandfather when she was a child, so she's not necessarily a two-dimensional villain. Not only did she inherit his mean streak, she inherited his 1958 Chrysler Saratoga. Midnight Cowboy's Jon Voight is her main lackey who prefers to be called ""Mr. Sir,"" and I'll bet most of the audience who saw this never knew of his role from that classic.Patricia Arquette's Kate Barlow, who we see in repeated flashbacks, is an outlaw we have every reason to cheer for, and while she's not the first of her kind, her story is genuinely sad. Though she's desired by every man in town, her heart is set on an Afro-American snake-oil salesman, and handy-man(Dulé Hill). Being that this is the old south, that angers all the white folks who burn down the school, kill his mule, and then him, while the Sheriff gets drunk to avoid arresting the mob. Needless to say, he's the first victim of her revenge, and more will follow until the day she dies.The movie's tone is somewhat reminiscent of the TV-Movies shown on ""The Wonderful World of Disney"" back in the late-1970's like ""The Young Runaways,"" where kids take on the injustices of adult authority, more so than ""Max Keeble's Big Move"" three years earlier, which wasn't so bad either. Unlike the other two movies, it contains a supernatural element, and let's you decide whether you want to believe in it or not. However, if you rent or buy the DVD, I strongly advise you to take some time to watch the deleted scenes for an enhanced view of life at Camp Greenlake. It's worth seeing either way.",Holes
47,bix171,Entertaining,8,21 April 2003,"In its ongoing effort to maintain relevance with today's young moviegoers while trying to appeal to their parents, Walt Disney Pictures continues to pair talented filmmakers with compelling projects and while action director Andrew Davis (`The Fugitive', `Under Siege') is no David Lynch (who directed Disney's `The Straight Story'), he does show a strong commitment to making his film the best it can be. `Holes' is based on Louis Sachar's beloved children's novel (he also wrote the screenplay) about Stanley Yelnats (Shia LaBouef, a Disney Channel favorite), sent to a camp for wayward teenage boys forced to dig holes in the Texas desert as punishment (but, unbeknownst to them, really looking for a buried treasure for warden Sigourney Weaver). There's a curse on the Yelnats family name that's directly tied to the story, much of it told in hundred-year-old flashbacks concerning events in both Texas and Eastern Europe. For its target audience of adolescents, it's a fairly convoluted plot but Davis and Sachar don't condescend in their storytelling and there shouldn't be any problems understanding it. Davis gets some entertainingly outsized performances from his adult actors--in addition to Weaver, there's Eartha Kitt, Henry Winkler, Patricia Arquette, Tim Blake Nelson, the always welcome Siobhan Fallon and, most notably, a funny Jon Voight in a delightful bouffant wig--and the kids seem eager to prove their chops, particularly LaBouef, whose likeability stems from his subtle underplaying in the face of all the exaggeration.

The actors were great and the film was adopted in an amazing way. The director understood the way in which Louis Sachar's Holes was written and directed it in a loyal manner. Yes, Stanley was overweight in the novel but skinny in the films, but it would seem foolish to have a huge guy climbing God's Thumb.

This is basically about a group of kids digging holes. Sounds boring right? well luckily we get a western side story to keep the movie rolling. It may start off slow but in the end you can't help but feel like you have spent your time very nicely.This is the first movie i saw with Shia Labeouf in it and i must say that he is turning into a excellent actor. He was great in this movie along with Khleo Thomas. Rounding off the great performances was Sigourney Weaver and Patricia Arquette.I recommend it.

We were so happy to finally get the chance.  Shia LaBeouf, while not ""overweight"" as the Stanley in the book, just shines as the main character!  I was mightily impressed by his performance.  The other kids in the movie were marvelous as well, particularly Khleo Thomas as Hector Zeroni.  The casting of this movie was amazing!  Jon Voight (was that his REAL beer gut?  LOL!!!), Sigourney Weaver, and Tim Blake Nelson all did a great job in their respective roles as Mr. Sir, the Warden, and Mr Pendanski.  Even though I knew what was going to happen as I'd read the book, I still was quite captivated by the story.  There are a few minor differences in the plot, but nothing distracting, and none of the best elements of the story were left out.  I wish Henry Winkler and Siobhan Fallon had larger roles, but they were as prescribed by the story.  Good movies that you can see with your whole family are becoming more and more rare.  This isn't only a good movie for the kids, but quite entertaining for the adults as well.  It is by far the best big studio movie I've seen this year.  AWESOME!",Holes

54,ilovedolby,"`Holes' proves not only to be a fun adventure for audiences of every age group, but also comes off as a touching, heart-warming story too.",8,24 April 2003,"Finally, Walt Disney releases a good family film that will appeal to kids, as well as adults. It seems that in recent monthscorrection, recent years, family films have followed a conventional pattern by just appealing to kids with the same rehashed stories. As a kid, you can't tell or even understand what a rehashed film is, but the parents sure can. `Holes' avoids those clichés and offers its audience interesting characters and story along the way. 	`Holes' is based on the best-selling book of the same title from author, Louis Sachar, who also wrote the screenplay. It's the story of a young man named Stanley Yelnats (Shia LeBeouf), who believes that he is cursed. `All the men of this family are cursed, and it's because of your great, great, pig stealin' grandfather,' according to Stanley's grandfather. While walking under a bridge one day, a pair of sneakers falls, as if from the sky, on Stanley and he is wrongfully arrested for stealing the sneakers. He is sentenced to a juvenile detention facility in the Texas desert, called Camp Green Lake. While there, he and every other boy has to dig holes, `in order to build character,' according to Mr. Sir (Jon Voight), the chief overseer of the boys. But while digging his usual hole-a-day, Stanley uncovers a mystery buried within the sand of the desert that has been kept secret for nearly 100 years. 	Several talented actors and actresses signed on to make `Holes.' Probably the most notable is Voight (`Mission: Impossible,' `Enemy Of The State') who plays the eccentric, Mr. Sir. Voight's character is hilarious and somewhat colorful, as well. He's always ready to shoot some poisonous lizard, or perhaps anything since he quit smoking. It's not uncommon for Voight to play such screwball characters-remember `Anaconda?' 	Sigourney Weaver (`Tadpole,' `Heartbreakers') plays Camp Green Lake's warden, Walker. The lead actress of the `Alien' films is just as unusual as Voight's character, Mr. Sir, is. As the warden, her staff and the boys in the camp fear her. In one scene she shows how sadistic she can be by putting on her own special brand of nail polish, which is made from snake venom. She then slaps Mr. Sir, scratching his face. Don't get the wrong impression though. Warden Walker is actually a funny individual for the most part.	Other talented actors that have smaller roles in `Holes' are Henry Winkler (`The Waterboy'), Siobhan Fallon (`The Negotiator'), and Tim Blake Nelson (`O Brother, Where Art Thou?'). 	Newcomer Shia LeBeouf is quite a good, young actor. His performance as Stanley was whimsical and light-hearted. LeBeouf can be seen later this summer in two potential blockbusters: `Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle,' and `Dumb And Dumberer.' 	Andrew Davis directed `Holes,' which is rather unorthodox for him considering he primarily makes action films. His most recent was last years, `Collateral Damage,' which starred Arnold Schwarzenegger. Among other technical qualities of `Holes' that are necessary to mention are its score, composed by Joel McNeely. McNeely's recent work can also be heard in James Cameron's documentary of the Titanic, `Ghosts Of The Abyss.' 	In the end, `Holes' proves not only to be a fun adventure for audiences of every age group, but also comes off as a touching, heart-warming story too. ***",Holes
55,ryan_kuhn,"""Did you tell him about the lizards?""",7,26 February 2005,"Holes is one of those films that kids love, and they do, they tell me all the time, that will also entertain the older kids, us grown-ups, as long as we remember it's only a kids movie. Louis Sachar wrote the screenplay based on his own book about a camp of kids who dig holes in the middle of a dried up lake bed in the middle of Texas. Alright, it's not really a camp, it's a hard labor detention encampment where the inmates dig holes because ""it builds character,"" but we know better. One of the pure pleasures of the movie is Jon Voight as an over-the-hill, been out in the sun too long water boy who makes sure the kids stay in line and continue to dig the holes. Voight is able to engulf the character of Mr. Sir so well and producers some of the movies biggest laughs. Sigorney Weaver is the head of the camp, she's called ""the warden,"" and is the one who wants to find something, anything out there in the middle of nowhere. The kids who do the time at the camp are the usual adolescent troublemakers, some with violent tempers, others who steal and lie, and others who don't know any better. Most of the movie follows around Stanley (Shia LaBeouf), or ""caveman"" as becomes known, a boy who was wrongly imprisoned, and his friend Zero (Khleo Thomas) who learns to read because of the work of Stanley. Interspersed through the movie is a back story about the town that used to be on the lake, before it dried up, starring Dule Hill and Patricia Arquette as forbidden lovers which explains a lot about the end of the movie, but I didn't think it quite worked in the spots that they were thrown into the movie. This is where perhaps Sachar kept to his book too closely, but this is only a minor quibble. The killer lizards also looked a little odd, perhaps we have not mastered CGI lizards yet, but all in all, the movie looks good, the hopelessness of the vast dried laked bed is fully realized, director Andrew Davis can be thanked for that. There is some interesting mythology at the end of the movie, one kids will love and, though The Fonz (Henry Winkler) plays a parent, parents will like as well.",Holes

57,Pavel-8,High quality family entertainment.,8,15 May 2003,"Many movies advertise that they are 'unlike anything you've ever seen.' ""Holes"" is the rare flick that can actually back up the cliché.  Most movies that claim that label are out-there weird or offer groundbreaking special effects.  ""Holes"" does neither; it is not strange or astonishing, but simply tells a very unique story.  Based on a wildly popular children's book, the movie is targeted at the same audience.  This is evident in most of the characters, which are largely caricatures or one-dimensional people.  But those single dimensions are painted so colorfully and effectively that they give the illusion of character depth.  Every actor fits his or her role perfectly.  The kids are well cast and provide the movie with a vivid camaraderie.  Shia LeBouf (Stanley) and Khleo Thomas (Zero) get the most screen time and are the most memorable.  Zero in particular is impossible to dislike.  The adults...Sigourney Weaver...Tim Blake Nelson...Patricia Arquette...Eartha Kitt...all are used very well, gobbling up their parts with gusto.  Dule Hill brings great tenderness to his role as Sam, and Jon Voight stands out as the off-kilter Mr. Sir.  He chews scenery with such exuberance that he nearly warrants boos and hisses.The most surprising thing about ""Holes"" is the non-linear narrative.  Few movies, let alone kids movies, are brave enough to bounce through time as ""Holes"" did.  Initially this was disorienting, but once the three storylines are introduced, one can follow the tales with ease.  Seeing disparate stories resolve into one another is a very satisfying and enjoyable movie experience, and ""Holes"" hits the proverbial bulls eye as it pulls everything together.  Nothing is ""Sixth Sense""-shocking, as one can garner the necessary information to piece the puzzle together in advance.  But there are quality 'Aha!' or head-nodding moments as the film winds down. 
As for the stories themselves, I hesitate to say much because I don't want to reveal anything about the refreshing uniqueness of the plot lines.  If you know nothing about the book, you might be bewildered during the opening minutes, but eventually that confusion will give way to a smiling enjoyment of the movie's peculiar humor.Bottom Line: Hollywood doesn't do live-action family entertainment much better than this.  Take the kids.  Enjoy the show.  8 of 10.",Holes

59,chow913,Child Slavery Is Disney Family Entertainment?,3,19 June 2013,"If anyone can figure out the meaning of this film, please don't bother telling me.How the f...... heck this became a Disney family film I have no idea. Nor do I have any idea what the actual purpose of this film was. Truthfully I don't. I even watched it a second time to make sure I didn't miss any symbolism or meaningful message. No, 'Hole' is completely devoid of any entertainment or meaning.The Plot: Shia LaBeouf stars... Oh who are they kidding? Nothing really ""stars"" Shia LaBeouf... as his usual annoyingly nervous and clumsy self whom is wrongfully convicted of stealing a pair of tennis shoes and given the cruel and unusual punishment of joining a chain gang to dig holes in the desert. Where is this? Singapore? Yes, that's the premise of the light hearted Disney romp, juvenile offenders being sadistically punished with inhumane desert conditions and being forced to dig holes in the middle of the desert.But the holes lead to something interesting right? WRONG! They're just holes! The meat of the film is sadists Sigourney Weaver and Jon Voight tormenting their juvenile prisoners. This isn't even done in fun or funny way like 'Cool Hand Luke' where the prisoners found inventive ways to have fun. These poor kids are just tormented for fun! Sigourney Weaver even uses snake venom as nail polish so her mere slap sends people into death spasms! That's Disney.The realistic pain of the victims isn't even funny in ways that at least the ultra violent prison films 'S.S. Hell Camp' and 'Rikki Oh' were funny.The film's run time is dragged out to 2.5 hours via flashbacks to Shia LaBeouf's ""pig thieving"" great grandfather whom cursed the family, and scenes of Patricia Arquette catching jungle fever in the wild west. WTF these scenes have to do with the hole digging chain gang is beyond me.The ending is truly tacked on as Roma Mafia pulls up in a black Jaguar as LaBeouf's attorney and manages to single handedly free the entire camp and arrest all the guards as LaBeouf digs up a chest with AT&T shares worth millions.

61,neenahhh,I hope Disney makes more movies like this one,7,29 January 2011,"I've been planning to give Holes a shot ever since a long time ago. I just never got around to do so. Holes doesn't actually seem like a Walt Disney movie. It wasn't Disney's usual style. It wasn't filled with heartwarming events from beginning to end. There were tough obstacles. There were even fights and small blood scenes. It was good, anyhow.Holes follows the tale of Stanley Yelnats IV, an unlucky boy whose destiny was fixed because of something his no-good-dirty-rotten-pig-stealing-great-great-grandfather did in the past.This movie had lots of comic relief. (SPOILERS) Even with the main character's own name! Stanley Yelnats. I found it quite amusing that they got the name 'Stanley' from their surname spelled backward. The whole idea of the dad trying to figure out the cure for bad odor of shoes! I liked the past with the original Stanley Yelnats following whatever Madame Zeroni told him to. Such a small touch of fairy tale fantasy, but it worked! I can't believe I didn't notice that Hector was a Zeroni and was related to THE Madame Zeroni. I'm not sure if Hector mentioned his last name to Stanley, but if he did, I sure as hell didn't notice. It was weird that Stanley just started singing that important song AFTER he carried Zero up the mountain. I mean, he JUST decided to sing it? Unrealistic.I thought that the warden and the other two's roles were unimportant. In the end, I guess they were supposed to be sort of like the ""bad guys"", but it just didn't seem that way. I also didn't get the connection between the warden and the original Kissing Kate. Are they the same person or is she a descendant? I didn't get that. I did like the part with Sam and the school teacher. And the part where the school teacher turned into Kissing Kate after seeing her loved one die.

62,K-Slicer,No Hole In My Head...,10,5 November 2003,"In the area of movies based off of screenplays from some other area (or whatever the title for that Oscar is), ""Holes"" has credibility. I think it is better to have the author create the screenplay because the author is the creator of the material. If the author can't write a screenplay to save their life, then have the author and someone fluently talented in the area of screenwriting create it. Aside from that, this review is about ""Holes"".The reasons start here and a spoiler maybe found within. (1) Louis Sachar is an excellent author and it turns that he can write a screenplay. I watched the movie and then read the book and both didn't reek incoherence or stupidity. Some people just have natural talents that can transcend mediums. (2) The best performance award goes to Shia LaBeouf for his portrayal as the main character. He ""dug"" himself into the role. I wanted to see his character vindicated before the conclusion. (3) To ratchet up the suspense a bit, Andrew Davis was brought in. This is the man that made Harrison Ford run hard and run fast. He also can make Steven Seagal smash some heads. As for this film, he made Shia and the rest of the boys dig some holes. In other words, he can make an ""action-packed"" movie and make it well even if ""action"" isn't the main genre isn't ""action"". (4) My second favorite performance goes to Jon Voight as Mr. Sir. Sometimes a goofy role brings out the best in a performer. When Voight uttered the line ""Once upon a time..."", I must have laughed for half a minute because it was so funny. He is capable of comedy and he should investigate a few more roles that let him to exercise that talent. (5) Tim Blake Nelson is very solid whenever he is given a solid script. This is probably the second best role I have seen him in (second only to 'O Brother Where Art Thou?'). (6) I love the choice of settings for the movie. I didn't know California was that dry or that barren. I guess population and land area figures both can be misleading. (7) The overall look of the movie made me want another bottle of water. One could only imagine digging a hole in that barren area for half a day. (8) The rest of the cast should deserve a box of Kudos bars as well. Sigourney Weaver, Henry Winkler, Khleo Thomas, Jake M. Smith and the rest of the bill were tapped because of their talents and it gelled very well. Great cast even though it was anywhere near ensemble. (9) I like a movie that doesn't explain anything right away. When Stanley got clocked in the head with those baseball cleats, it made me want to see how weird the events could get and that is a key ingredient in making a good movie. (10) Disney Pictures (not Touchstone, DISNEY!!) needs to make a few more of these mature juvenile films. It was palatable for me and I am a college student. The last  mature juvenile Disney film I saw was ""Something Wicked This Way Comes"" and ""Holes"" possibly exceeds it (like the election in 2000, it's still to close to call). Disney can make greatness if they decide to expand on this genre and keeps artistry in mind over milking a cash cow when they see it. Ten reasons give a score of ten!All in all, ""Holes"" is one of my favorite Disney films and probably one of the best this year (granted this movie may not be Oscar material but whoever said Oscar material is the best material?). In terms of being a movie from a book I have read, this ranks behind ""Fight Club"" on my list (which is on top). For being a film I saw in 2003, this is in the top five (somewhere behind ""Mystic River""). Compared against ""Harry Potter"", Stanley Yelnats easily takes a shovel to Harry's head and brings the final death blow with a smelly sneaker to Potter's nose. Everybody should see this movie because it both informs and entertains. Here ends my rant!",Holes

I didn't know what to think about it when I heard it was about kids digging holes.  How could a movie be based on this?!While the movie did start off a little slow and was quite confusing, things finally came together to form a nice, interesting movie with some good twists.  The actors in the movie were generally good.  Most exceptional were Shia LaBeouf as Stanley and Khleo Thomas as Zero, maybe just because they were so likable.  The rest of the boys at the Camp were just punks, but maybe they were supposed to be!  The adults in the movie did a nice job too, but nothing too exceptional.The setting of the movie also kind of bothered me.  It's kind of hard to really get attached to a movie that's based on a juvenile correction camp. That's not such a happy place, but that's life, I guess!So overall, this is a good, solid family film.

Frankly,I don't know what all the concern about not being able to enjoy the movie without reading the book is about (although I must say I'm all for reading books, esecially in the case of teenagers!).  This film is miles ahead of many teen movies which have been released recently.  *****Mild Spoilers Ahead******A teenage boy named Stanley Yelnats is sent to a strange camp for juveniles in the desert for stealing a pair of tennis shoes.  At the camp, he meets an odd assortment of adults as well as an interesting variety of fellow 'campers'.  The campers are forced to dig holes in the desert all day long by an eccentric warden (Sigourney Weaver) who is looking for buried treasure.  The guard (Jon Voight) and the counselor (Tim Blake Nelson) are very unusual characters indeed.  There truly seems to be very little rehabilitation or correction going on at the camp but there is plenty of bizarre behavior as well as demeaning treatment of the campers.  Things at the camp change drastically after two of the boys run away, one of which will be a problem for the warden because 'someone cares about what happens to him.'The young actor who plays Stanley is terrific.  His friendship which develops with Zero (another fine performance by a young actor) is a treat to see develop on screen.  This is an odd little movie that is all the more bittersweet because it is on the verge of being terrific because it oozes an atmosphere all it's own.  The directing is good, but not great.  The sense that there is something more waiting to erupt from beneath the surface of this film is palpable.  The three well known stars (Weaver, Voight and Nelson) are hilarious in their roles but unfortunately it doesn't seem that their characters were incorporated into the film as well as they could have been.  The result is that they seem like caricatures of people when the film begs for the director to drop the 'showcase the talent' theme he's given them and simply let them be character actors who enrich the film.  As far as the director's choice to use all of the flashbacks in the movie regarding the history of the buried treasure and Stanley's ancestors, it might have been a better movie if they had been kept to a minimum and more attention paid to the boys in the present.""Holes"" is more interesting than most of the drivel that is passing for entertainment in recent years.  It's a great movie for teens because there is no doubt the opportunity for them to learn something about appreciating movies and reading books that can be gleaned from this movie experience. I'd rate it an 80/100.  Rent it on video and check out the book from the library; that's your reading assignment from an amateur movie critic.",Holes

This has a great cast with the likes of then newcomer Shia LaBeouf,Jon Voight,Tim Blake Nelson,Sigourney Weaver and Patricia Arquette and it is one of Shia LaBeouf's best roles as Stanley Yelnats/Caveman and I also liked Jon Voight's role as Marion Sevillo or Mr.Sir but I liked them two together as Jon Voight was like a second father to Shia LaBeouf as mentioned a lot in the past.And also a well done to the other members to the cast that I didn't mention.

68,JAKastner,The Moose Hole - Review of Holes,8,19 April 2003,"Around this time of the year, most studios try to dump moderate films that have a relatively small budget right before the beginning of the summer season. But Disney hopes to make somewhat a big profit with their film version of the famous children's book, Holes. Though the commercials on television make it seem like the book Holes is a hugely famous book, there are many out there that have never even heard of it. The marketing for the film has targeted many demographics in hopes of bringing in a huge audience but Disney is not taking any chances so they have brought in stars like Sigorny Weaver and Jon Voight to help the tweener flick. But all this work and hopefully make this film another Remember the Titans for Walt Disney Pictures or will it fail like Piglet's Big Movie?The story focuses on Stanley Yelnats the Fourth, who gets in trouble with law after he is accused of stealing a pair of baseball shoes from a famous baseball player that was given to raise money for the poor. Stanley's grandfather blames it on the family curse which was started by Stanley's great grandfather who forgot to carry an old fortune teller up a mountain to let her gain more strength after he had taken a pig from her in an attempt to marry a young woman in his local village. Stanley is sent by the court to Camp Greenlake for eighteen months. Unfortunately this is no paradise trip for him. The lake dried up over a hundred years ago and the Warden forces the little troublemakers to dig holes everyday in the desert. But in this terrible situation, Stanley hopes to break the family curse and make a life for himself. The story of Holes is very well done. There is enough slapstick humor to keep the young children entertained but enough story twists and tense moments to not bore the adults. The cast of Holes is amazing considering that many of them are unknowns to the movie-going audience. Shia LaBeouf, who can be seen on the Disney Channel series Even Stevens, is probably the most impressive member of the cast. He has a lot of emotion that is used well in this film. LaBeouf should be able to become a big star if he continues to act in films like this. Jon Voight is fabulous in this film as the somewhat scary Mr. Sir. He is best known for his dramatic acting in films like Enemy of the State and Pearl Harbor but he has a great comic timing in this feature that most have not seen before. Sigorny Weaver is good as the Warden but you don't see her character until relatively half-way through the film and even when you do see her, you don't get as much character development as the other members of the cast. Henry Winkler, who is best known for Happy Days, makes a funny, if not brief, appearance as Stanley's father in the film. Winkler should receive a lead in a comedy soon but until then let's hope he appears in roles in this.Overall, Holes is probably the most teenage orientated film from Walt Disney Pictures in quite some time and will be the last one until Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl opens in July. One must note that this is not your typical Mickey Mouse films with several foul language words being used within the course of the film. But this doesn't mean that is bad. There are very few things to say badly about the film Holes, but there are some. For one, the time length is a perfect at two hours but does seem to be a little too much for a film intended for younger children. Also, the story, though very well done, does seem a big dragged out in parts which can slow down the film a bit. Lastly, not as many characters get to act outside of the usual slapstick gags which can disappoint some. Outside of those small squabbles, Holes is probably the best film out in theaters since Phone Booth. The film is very well done that should appeal to everyone in the family. Note that film does contain a lot of references to death, acts of killing, and bad language that may not be suitable to small children. Just a word of warning to those that are expecting the normal Disney treatment.My Rating: **** out of 5 (Grade: B+)",Holes

I think HOLES and the HARRY POTTER films are the best family movies I've seen in quite a while (they're also the best young adult books I've read in quite a while). All of the performances were good to great. I was originally afraid that Shia LaBeouf wasn't right for the part, but he really carries the movie very nicely. Voight, Weaver, and Tim Blake Nelson all give some of their best performances ever.The direction by Andrew Davis is superb. I really hope Davis continues to do movies like this. He really knows film. The screenplay by Louis Sachar (who also wrote the book) was also great. I hope Sachar adapts some of his other books to film (perhaps Dogs Don't Tell Jokes or Sideways Stories from Wayside School).

Looking at it from an objective perspective, a movie about children digging holes as punishment for delinquent behavior in the desert seems cruel and unpleasant to watch. The child actors do not miss a beat, however, and the characters are instantly endeared to the viewer with undeserved suffering, innocent mindsets, and a sense of morality that appeals to the audiences own alignment. The film is presented in little chapter like portions, where there are no wasted scenes, and everything said or shown ties into the main plot. What this film does well is walking the line between forgiven the antagonist of all of their sins at the end due to past hardship, and condemning them without pity, which would seem cruel. At the end of the film,the warden and slavedriver of the camp, Louise Walker, is taken off to jail, but her behavior is explained with her obsessive and unking grandfather who beat this lifestyle into her at a young age. This film could have been an utter mess, but the strange elements seem to work together to create a fun story, and teach a lesson in morality (the fable of the Yelnats family curse).",Holes
74,ColeSear,When Disney doesn't Over-sell their films...,10,19 May 2003,"They actually have a good film on their hands...First, I do believe that I have to see this movie again because what most impressed me about 'Holes' is that it didn't insult its target audience for one second. When a story is good, like this one is, Kids don't care if it's long or complicated. Story is all that matters and everything they're focused on this story has great characters who are all well played.Sigourney Weaver and Jon Voight are fantastic in their roles. Ms. Weaver's performance along with the direction of the story completely fooled me. Tim Blake Nelson, also does a great job as the kind of guy who'll pat you on the back just to find a good place to stick a knife in, what was truly impressive is that as the movie progressed i started hating him. That is also the strength of the ""gang"" they watch out for each other but aren't necessarily friends all the time. X-Ray also got on my nerves alot times.The characters in this film nare not the same and what is the most realistic is their interaction. As for the structure of the film its brilliant anyone who thinks this movie will confuse kids is clueless. If anything the filmmakers try a little too hard to establish the multiple-storylines in the beginning. I never read the book but the structure does seem very novelic indeed and its a great fantasy. Most impressive of all was Patricia Arquette's performance, honestly i had confused her with Daryl Hannah for most of the film (and I've never liked either of them her and Dule Hill's interaction really made the 1800s segment work.Like I said it requires another viewing but this yet another great Disney live action film like last year's ""The Rookie"" Disney has abandoned it's Eisner instilled holier-than-thou attitude on occasion and they are making films that Walt Disney himself may have liked because they respect the audience instead of pandering to them.",Holes
75,rbsjrx,Not for kids only,9,10 May 2004,"Unlike others here, I was never exposed to the book, so this movie was a mystery to me. I'd heard the generally positive reviews and read what passed for plot synopsis, but all I came away with was, ""What?!?"" This is a difficult movie to synopsize without giving away too much of the intricately woven plot. If this is what young teen-agers are reading, there may be hope for us yet.This is a movie that requires constant attention. The plot is revealed in fits and starts with modern day action intercut with flashbacks and clues in plain view at the periphery of the scenes. The story is about the  bad luck Yelnats clan, all of which leads to the youngest family scion, Stanley (his first and last name together are a palindrome). There are actually five interrelated subplots:1) The origin of the family curse.2) The history of the site of the juvenile detention camp where the protagonist finds himself. This takes place in the old west.3) A story of Stanley's great-grandfather, who made a fortune and then lost it in events which touch on plot #2.4) The story of the camp warden and her family. This also relates to plot #2.5) The modern day plight of Stanley and his family.Sound complicated? It is, but it all entwines in some exceptional storytelling. The ending wraps up all five stories in an entirely satisfying way.So what is this and who would like it? Well, it's not a children's movie in any conventional sense. It requires attention and doesn't have a lot of ""action"". It's not riveting, but it is masterful storytelling. The film makers don't milk any scenes beyond their logical conclusion, so the intercutting between modern events and flashbacks could be disorienting to some viewers. The performances are all first rate. Jon Voigt is over the top as the dim-witted head guard, and Sigourney Weaver has her most deliciously evil role since ""Snow White: A Tale of Terror"". The juvenile roles are all excellent, especially the critical roles of Shia LaBeouf as Stanley and Khleo Thomas as ""Zero"". Eartha Kitt turns in a brief but effective performance as the old Latvian Gypsy who started the family curse. Patricia Arquette and Dulé Hill are touching in the critical roles as tragically star-crossed interracial lovers in the old west.If you let it, this is a highly involving film and time well spent. I was only going to give this 4 stars because it's not particularly showy, but wound up giving it 5 since it delivers everything it intends. The story is intricate, but still not particularly grand.

He really captures the slightly psychotic, sleazy and evil head ""screw"" to Sigourney Weaver's ""warden"": the devious treasure hunters using child slave labour to find the hoard.

81,perlner,"should have been called ""plot holes""",4,19 May 2003,"I can't figure out why this dumb, campy movie is getting such good feedback from IMDB users and professional reviewers alike. The effects and dialogue are B-movie at best, the adult characters are all ridiculously clownish caricatures, and even the kids, who make a valiant effort to be believable, just don't have either the talent or the material of a Haley Joel Osment or even a MacCaulay Culkin.There are plot holes in this movie bigger than any hole dug within the story. I guess the writers figured it didn't matter because the children would be too busy rooting for the main characters, who are the standard kid protagonists that every child will identify with, to notice the things that don't make sense.I think this is a terrible precedent for a children's film. Besides the shoddy filmmaking, there are no lessons learned, the main characters hardly mature, and the ""solved mystery,"" while neatly wrapping up the premise, offers us nothing except a child's-eye view of poetic justice (not even fairytale-worthy). A good children's film will incite imaginations, promote good values, and perhaps challenge the youngster's emotions a little. This film doesn't.There are a few redeeming features of this film -- one, it is mostly entertaining. Most of the time, it moves pretty quickly, despite the fact that nothing much happens through most of the movie, and it's almost two hours long. (Most of the interesting parts of the story are told through flashbacks, but whose memories is unclear, in one of the many plot holes.) Two, while Patricia Arquette's and Dule Hill's characters aren't remotely believable, they do have excellent on-screen chemistry. Three, Sigourney Weaver, while less of a character than in most of her recent works, is charmingly evil, though she gets very little screen time. And four, despite its shortcomings, it's got charm and innocence that will entertain your 4-10 year olds. So, for those 4 redeeming qualities, I gave it 4/10.Just don't bother seeing it if you have no children.",Holes

Once is finished, by reconstructing the movie, you realize an almost perfect fit in all it's parts, something you don't see much nowadays. I mean, even if it's Disney stuff (and we all know what that means), the magic it shares is not as candid as anyone may expect. Of course there is the happy ending, the mean people put in it's place and the good ones rewarded, but is in the way and the warmth which is treated the entire movie as well as the actors involved, the main reason to see it; and enjoy it.

In being so much like the book, and after I had read it and very much enjoyed it, it seemed boring, stale, too modernized, less of the mythic qualities I loved. Holes was so fascinating when I read it, and here they get the basic idea right on the nail. But they either had to do it exactly or drastically differently for me to really like it. As it was, I was simply reading a Spark Notes version of the book, with none of the fascinating and haunting and mythic qualities i mentioned before.

Well, that's the kind of experience Stanley Yelnats (Shia LaBeouf) is going through right now. He is accused of stealing Clyde Livingston's (Rick Fox) World Series shoes. He did not commit the crime however, the shoes actually just fell from the sky and on top him, and not long after that, he was arrested and charged with theft. He, however, would never do such a thing since after all, his favorite baseball player is Livingston. Nevertheless, the judge offers him jail or Camp Greenlake, and Stanley says, ""Well, I've never been to camp before"" and its settled, he is sentenced to 18 months at Camp Greenlake.He arrives at Camp Greenlake and upon arrival, finds out that there is no lake at all. It's a dry lake bead crawling with deadly yellow spotted lizards and rattle snakes. The kids there are all very mean to him. The only person who doesn't poke fun of him is Zero (Khleo Thomas), a quiet kid who only talks to Stanley. The people who are in charge at the camp are: Mr. Sir (Jon Voight), The Warden (Sigourney Weaver), and Mr. Pedanski (Tim Blake Nelson). They are not the nicest people in the world either, in which Stanley finds out very shortly.At camp, what you basically do all day is dig holes. They also can't just be small holes, they have to be 5 feet deep, and 5 feet wide. It seems pointless to all the boys but as Mr. Sir explains to Stanley, ""You take a bad boy, make him dig holes, and it turns him into a good boy, that's our philosophy here at Camp Greenlake"". Well, not exactly, as Stanley later finds out the real reason why they dig holes later in the movie.This movie has many flashbacks in it. The Yelnats family blaims their son's misfortune on his great grandfather, who was cursed by a fortune teller when failed to accomplish the last part of his mission for her. The movie also flashes back to Kissin Kate Barlow, a woman who had a major reason for why the boys would be digging holes to this day. This is a great movie, fun for the whole family. The acting is excellent and director Andrew Davis (director of ""The Fugitive"") does a great job in picking the right people for the right parts. The movie does a great job in doing it's flashbacks correctly. The best part of this movie is how great a job it does in tying things all together to make sense. This is the best movie I have seen since ""Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"". I read the book, and I was very excited upon hearing that a movie was coming out for it. Even for those of you who haven't read the book, you will still enjoy this great family movie. My advice: See it now. It's much more exciting and sometimes intense in the theater than it is at home. This movie should appeal to both adults and children, it did with my family, and I hope when you see it to, that it will appeal to your family as well.

How about one of the best of the decade!,10,19 April 2003,"I've not read Louis Sachar's original book HOLES, but his movie adaptation not only works splendidly as a film, it contains so much story material--with several interlocking mysteries variously turning upon class conflict, prejudice, thwarted desire, and the consequences of personal transgressions being passed down through the generations--that I'm prepared to say it's as faithful a translation of the book as one might care for (though I'll seek out the book to make sure, of course).  Few filmmakers could have handled the various backstories' complexities, but HOLES delivers its flashbacks matter-of-factly and with faith in the audience's ability to follow along and put the pieces together.  (And while it IS a kids' film, it offers a lot to adult viewers; anyone who enjoyed John Sayles's LONE STAR, for instance, should see HOLES.)  No Hollywood formula could possibly contain the plot, and a lot of tension results because it's nearly impossible to predict what's going to happen from moment to moment.  While the ending was a little too perfect, Sachar so ingeniously worked even apparent throwaway bits into the narrative logic, not to mention coming up with a perfect resolving symbol for one of the generational stories, that I'll not quibble.Andrew Davis's direction was so eye-catching-yet-efficient that on the basis of this film and THE FUGITIVE I'm ready to venerate him as the reincarnation of Michael Curtiz.  The cast was good-to-excellent; while Jon Voight, Tim Blake Nelson and Sigourney Weaver gave their own spins to the present-day villains, the juvenile actors largely carry the movie.

95,connorwburnett,Adolescent Shawshank Redemption,7,7 August 2021,"I'll keep this review short and simple. Holes is an adventure/drama set around a group of teenagers forced to dig holes (as opposed to serving time in prison) in search for hidden treasure from the area's past.The film Holes is an adaptation of the book, with the same title. Its been a very long time since I've read the book so I can't remember how faithfully the source material is converted. Although, when judging Holes solely on the basis of it as a film it holds up very well and is an all-round enjoyable experience.It clearly drew much of its inspiration from The Shawshank Redemption, containing many of the main story beats. Two characters sharing a close bond in the prison setting, a new young character arriving on the scene after the midway point of the film, one character escaping from the prison setting first whilst the other fears that they may have died, the two characters reuniting again to later share a prosperous, happy future together. The similarities are clearly apparent however they do not at all subtract from the viewing experience. If you're going to take heavy inspiration from a film, there are few better to take from than Shawshank.This film is far better than it needs to be. The performances, especially from the adult actors, were very entertaining. The film flows well and never feels dull. For a film perceived as targeted towards children it really holds up for all ages which is highly commendable.I don't see many errors that are too noticeable, of course it's no masterpiece, perhaps the cinematography is a little bland and Shia LaBeouf's character can be a little irritating. He's quite a pushover and I would have liked his character to have developed more by the end.Overall, Holes accomplishes what it sets out to do, presenting a captivating lighthearted prison drama.",Holes

I was so thankful to see that Sachar also wrote the screenplay, because the story was great to begin with, and I did not want another writer to mess it up, frankly.  From start to finish, this movie is excellent and completely captures the setting, characters, and feeling of the book. Especially outstanding was the actor who played Hector ""Zero"" Zeroni.  I rated this movie a 10/10 and would recommend it to anyone who has either read the book, plans to read it, or can watch with an open mind and pay attention to tiny details because they will be important later on.",Holes

The soundtrack is brilliant and there is plenty of emotion. There is just one giant problem, this movie is in no way a faithful adaption of the book. In the book Pendanski was a much kinder and nicer character who tried to help Stanley at every turn and wasn't one of the villains. Mr. sir was 10 times more evil and malicious in the book. Also the book was much darker and more graphic. If this had been a faithful adaptation rather then it being given the house of mouse treatment, it would have been rated pg-13 or even R easily. As I said this is a good movie don't get me wrong but it's not faithful to the book at all.",Holes
98,driffma,What was Disney thinking? It made a great movie.,10,28 May 2003,"Holes is a fable about the past and the way it affects the present lives of at least three people.  One of them I will name, the other two are mysteries and will remain so.  Holes is a story about Stanley Yelnats IV.  He is unlucky in life.  Unlucky in fact characterizes the fates of most of the Yelnats men and has been since exploits of Stanley IV's `no good-dirty-rotten-pig-stealing-great-great-grandfather.'  Those particular exploits cursed the family's men to many an ill-fated turn.  It is during just such a turn that we meet Stanley IV.  He has been accused, falsely, of stealing a pair of baseball shoes, freshly donated to a homeless shelter auction, by a famous baseball player.  He is given the option of jail, or he can go to a character building camp.  `I've never been to camp before,' says Stanley.  With that the Judge enthusiastically sends him off to Camp Green Lake.Camp Green Lake is an odd place, with an odd philosophy, `If you take a bad boy, make him dig a hole every day in the hot sun, it will turn him into a good boy.'  We learn this little pearl of wisdom from Mr. Sir (John Voight) one of the camp's `counselors.'  We get the impression right away that he is a dangerous man.  He at least wears his attitude honestly; he doesn't think he is nice.  The camp's guidance councilor, Mr. Pendanski (Tim Blake Nelson) is a different matter entirely.  He acts the part of the caring sensitive counselor, but he quick, quicker than anyone else in authority to unleash the most cruel verbal barbs at his charges.  The Warden has a decided capacity for meanness, but other than that she is a mystery.  These three rule Camp Green Lake, a place that has no lake.  It is just a dry dusty desert filled with holes, five feet deep and five feet wide.  Its local fauna, seem only to be the vultures, and dangerous poisonous yellow-spotted lizards.  Green Lake seems is, in many ways, a haunted place.Holes works in spite of the strange setting, and the strange story, because it understands people.  Specifically because it is honest in the way it deals with the inmates of Camp Green Lake.  The movie captures the way boys interact with one another perfectly.  It captures the way boys can bully each other, they way they can win admiration, the way they fight with one another, and the way boys ally themselves along the age line.  It is this well nuanced core that makes everything else in the film believable. What is also refreshing about this film the good nature of its main character. He does not believe in a family curse, he is not bitter about the infamous exploits of his `no good-dirty-rotten-pig-stealing-great-great-grandfather.' In fact he loves hearing the story.  Stanley IV is not bitter about the past, and determined not let it affect him in the way it has affected his father and grandfather.  There is at times a lot of sadness in the film, but not a lot wallowing angsty silliness.  And that is refreshing.
Holes is an intelligent, insightful and witty family movie.  It entertains, and not in any cheap way.  It is not a comedy, though it has its laughs. It dares to be compelling, where many family movies tend to play it safe and conventional.  As such it transcends the family movie genera and simply becomes a good film that everyone can enjoy.

The whole plot hinges on a series of bizarre coincidences that land our (innocent) hero in a juvie detention center in the dead middle of nowhere in the desert, laboring to dig holes. Sigourney Weaver is the very sketchy warden, and does a fine job of being the sort of disciplinarian you'd never ever wants your kids under. The important thing that I was pleased to see carry over into the movie from the book is the fact that the boys, every one, really *are* in danger, mortal danger. (Unlike in many kids' movies where the kids think they're in danger but really aren't, in this one, you understand that little Stanley Yelnats really is in danger, and that he's willing to sacrifice a lot to remove his friends from that danger.)

It races from Latvia's lush greenness to the pock-marked Camp Green Lake (hint: there's no lake and no green).Disney's first success is re-creating the novel's environments so convincingly - the set design is superb and without gloss. The other plus is in the casting. Rising star Shia LaBeouf (Charlie's Angels 2, Project Greenlight) might not be the fat boy of the book, but his attitude is right and he's far from the usual clean-cut hero. The rest of the cast is filled out equally well, from Patricia Arquette as the Frontier school marm-turned-bank robber to Henry Winkler as Stanley's dad.

It will make a viewer think about how our world once was, and sometimes how it still is today. Racism still comes up in our environment, even thought it had been stated that ""God has created us equally"".

Of course, you have to start with great source material.The casting was excellent - thank goodness Disney didn't decide to go with kid-friendly (and obnoxious) Frankie Muñiz or (ugh) Alex Linz for Stanley, as the trivia section for this movie suggests were possibilities. Shia LaBeouf was outstanding.Sigourney Weaver was wonderful, though I was disappointed that the scene where she pokes one of the kids in the chest with the pitchfork and knocks him back into a hole was left on the cutting room floor. (It's included among the Deleted Scenes on the DVD). Including that would have made her character that much more villainous, just as she comes across in the book. Otherwise we're left with just that one scene of pure viciousness - where she swipes Mr. Sir with her nails. And at the end, she crumbles in front of Stanley and pleads with him for a look in the locked chest, and then later cries while being arrested - making her practically sympathetic.Jon Voight, unfortunately, seemed to go for a comic turn as Mr. Sir, where a more ruthless interpretation would have been more faithful. It was like watching James Best as Sheriff Roscoe P. Coltrane in The Dukes of Hazzard at times. But Tim Blake Nelson was absolutely ideal as Pendanski, deftly moving from *seemingly* concerned father-(or, actually, mother-)figure to mean bastard as the script dictated. The kids were all excellent, especially Khleo Thomas as Zero. They expanded the scenes at Stanley's home, and added a grandfather!, and surprise, it all worked!

The trailer made it look funnier then it actually was as well, I believe this is one movie where EVERY funny part was shown in the trailer, with few laugh-out-loud scenes.Music in the movie seemed to be mostly re-cut and regurgitated remakes of older songs (""lets go down to the river to pray"" and ""I will survive""), which makes me think how my generation cant make anything good for itself.... haha. Directing was good, although some scenes could definitely benefit from high-speed film, there were too many times where something would slow down from normal speed and then look blurry. Acting was all right, nothing special though; plenty good enough for kids, although I do find it frustrating that EVERYTHING that is Disney has Stanley (Shia LaBeouf) in it. They should hire more/better actors. This role would have been better suited for someone else.Guns, killing animals, blood and racial themes/lynching give this film its PG rating. For a Disney film in which parents will take all ages to seems almost not enough. I would say this movie should get a PC rating for ""Parents Cautioned"".

Director Andrew Davis spins several fantastical yarns into a solidly entertaining film; effortlessly interweaving themes of redemption, identity, friendship and self-reliance.Holes is the story of Stanley Yelnats IV (Shia LeBeouf in his breakout role), the teenage son of poor inventor Stanley III (Henry Winkler). Stanley (the younger) is wrongly convicted of theft and sent to Camp Green Lake, a juvenile prison work camp that digs - you guessed it - Holes. He quickly discovers Camp Green Lake is anything but, and the audience will recognize familiar prison tropes (though on a kid-friendly scale).But the full scope of the story reaches back generations, interweaving fantasy tales from multiple time periods of family curses, lost love, and Western outlaws. This is where the film shines, showing true heart while keeping a light-hearted tone.As with any Disney film, sure it's a little far-fetched at times, and naturally there's some Deus Ex Machina to bring the movie to the requisite (and fully expected) perfectly happy conclusion.

The connections develop among Stanley, his buddy ""Zero"", the warden, and the dry lake-bed where Camp Greenlake is situated.

I expected an annoying children's film, but what I found was an intelligent, intriguing, and magical film, with good performances, a well-written script, and great direction. I have never seen the award-winning book, the film is based on, but the story is very fascinating. It deals with a kid named Stanley Yelnats (Stanley is Yelnats spelled backwards), who is accused of stealing a pair of tennis shoes that belonged to a famous athlete, and in consequence is sentenced to spend time at a detention camp for 18 months, digging one hole a day. The camp is ran by the Warden (Sigourney Weaver), Mr. Sir (Jon Voight), and counselor Mr. Pendanski ( Tim Blake Nelson). The kids at the camp are an array of misfits and troublemakers, with nicknames like Armpit, X-Ray, and Magnet. There is a kid known as ""Zero"", who only talks to Stanley. One day when ""Zero"" runs away, Stanley runs after him, and later they find a secret to a curse that was put on Stanley's family over a century ago. Cut in between this story, is the story of 'Kissin' Kate' Barlow (Patricia Arquette), an outlaw, who left a kiss mark on all of her kissing victims. At first, it is unclear what this story has to do with the main plot, but it eventually becomes clear. ""Holes"" is great family entertainment, although the trailer makes it look like more of a film for younger kids, although I think older kids will appreciate it much more.

124,firetop14,If you have not seen this movie you have been DEPRIVED!,10,29 April 2005,"And I'm serious! Truly one of the most fantastic films I have ever had the pleasure of watching. What's so wonderful is that very rarely does a good book turn into a movie that is not only good, but if possible better than the novel it was based on. Perhaps in the case of Lord of the Rings and Trainspotting, but it is a rare occurrence indeed. But I think that the fact that Louis Sachar was involved from the beginning helped masses, so that the film sticks close to the story but takes it even further. This film has many elements that make it what it is:1. A unique, original story with a good mix of fun and humour, but a mature edge. 2. Brilliant actors. Adults and kids alike, these actors know how to bring the story to life and deliver their lines with enthusiasm and style without going overboard, as sometimes happen with kids movies. 3. Breathtaking scenery. And it doesn't matter if it's real or CGI, the setting in itself is a masterpiece. I especially love the image of the holes from a birds eye view. 4. A talented director who breathes life into the book and turns it into technicolour genius. The transitions in time work well and capture the steady climax from the book, leading up to the twists throughout the film. 5. Louis Sachar! The guy who had me reading a book nonstop from start to finish so that I couldn't put it down. He makes sure that the script sticks to the book, with new bits added in to make it even better. 6. And speaking of the script! The one-liners in this are smart, funny and unpatronising. But there are also parts to make you smile, make you cry, and tug at your heartstrings to make you love this story all the more. 7. Beautiful soundtrack. There's not a song in this film that I haven't fallen for, and that's something considering I'm supposed to be a punk-rocker. The songs link to the story well and add extra jazz to the overall style of the film. If you're going to buy the film, I recommend you buy the soundtrack too, especially for ""If Only"", which centres around the story and contains the chorus from the book.I do not work for the people who made Holes, by the way, I'm just a fan, plugging my favourite film and giving it the review it deserves.

As for my husband he has watched it on a couple occasion by himself. Together or alone it is a film that makes you feel good. Shia LaBeouf gives an excellent performance. He and Khleo Thomas have a chemistry between them that make the characters believable and make you root for them. Jon Voight is perfect in the role of ""Sir"" and Sigourney Weaver is just evil as the warden. It is a wonderful tale of commitment,honesty, love and determination. The characters draw us in to their families both at home and in the work camp. We root for the underdogs and champion a cause. Children learn about prejudice, deception and what can happen when you least expect it.

130,galaescobar,"Much better than ""Not Bad""",9,13 August 2006,"I couldn't keep from commenting after reading the very short ""Not bad"" commentary. This movie is much better than just not bad. The acting is stellar, even from the children in the cast, who don't play cute or anything else but act just like my son's friends. The movie is smart and expects it's audience to be as well. The double back flash story lines are imaginative and contribute to the story rather than act as time filler. I watched this movie with my kids and then I watched it again by myself a few days later. If you have kids and are sick to death of movies that inspire a diabetic coma with their syrupy sweetness, then check out ""Holes.""

By the end of the film, though, every confusing aspect of the plot has been satisfactorily explained. The character of Mr. Sir is particularly entertaining, and of course we just KNOW that he'll get his comeuppance. My only complaint is one that Disney's special-effects crew should have fixed---a rainstorm didn't appear very believable because sunlight still covered the ground and everyone cast shadows.",Holes

The ensemble of kids ALL do a good job (particularly standouts Shia LaBeouf and Khleo Thomas), Jon Voight is over the top as ""Mr. Sir""--somewhat reminiscent of Jack Nicholson in ""The Shining""!--a weirdly menacing character who pales only slightly to the real villain, the Warden, played by the always delightful Sigourney Weaver. Throw in Henry Winkler as an oddball scientist seeking a cure for smelly shoes, Patricia Arquette as a schoolmarm turned bandit, Dule' Hill as Sam, who can fix anything except prejudice, and Eartha Kitt--yes, EARTHA KITT!!!--as a gypsy whose curse follows the Yelnats family--and you've got a real family jewel.

The movie was excellent and the only flaws I can say is Stanley and Zero should've stayed on the mountain longer. I don't flip out like other people did when Stanley ended up not being fat, I found out why,because the director didn't want Shia LaBeouf to get overworked. Shia LaBeouf is an excellent actor,he played the role well,it was different from his ""Even Stevens"" role,and he showed true dramatic sequences by himself,and with the other actors. Khleo Thomas also did a great job. He was so believable as Zero,that I believed everything he said. You just get this feeling when you watch this movie,like you feel for these kids. It's a Junior Shawshank Redemption,of Escape from Alcatraz,but for kids 15 and younger. Sigourney Weaver,Jon Voight,Patricia Arquette,and Henry Winkler all did fine jobs,especially Jon Voight.

To put it concisely, HOLES is a good story, full of imagination, multiple generations and stories interlocking, and nice happy ending. However, the execution of it was just a bit off.  From the casting to the way some scenes were shot, it just felt almost right at best.  A lot of the cast seemed to be miscast and much of the dialogue and character interaction seemed forced and too scripted.  And as much as I might have thought it cool at that age, when the movie tries to paint these Jr High boys as cool and tough and all this nickname stuff, it just comes off lame.

They use some famous actors which give a great effect on the film. The graphics is a bit dodgy in some parts, and there are quite a few mistakes throughout the film. There is no such thing as a Yellow Spotted Lizard, for example. The camp is not as gruesome as explained in the book, and they tend not to show the goings on in the camp as much as the book.

140,magic_eight_ball737,"Great movie for kids, decent movie for adults",7,26 January 2013,"I loved this movie when I was kid. I read the book religiously (along with the Harry Potter series) and, having not seen the movie for a very long time, I decided to give it a go again. The resulting movie was just... messy. It was still a well done movie (considering it's for kids) but just... messy. A few things bugged me, and I'll explain why:1) A large ensemble cast. I feel that a cast this large should only be allowed if each character within the ensemble has a particular role. Otherwise, they're shark-bait. Take the film Inception for example: a large ensemble, but each character had a purpose. I don't understand why we are going deep into Sir and Pendanski's stories. I don't understand why we're going deep into all the prisoners stories. The arrival of Twitch's character is just annoying... he doesn't even need to be there. 2) The pacing. You've got a very large story (and timeline, if you will) to shove into one two- hour movie. This is what I mean by the film being ""messy"". Flashbacks are good. In fact, I enjoy flashbacks - as long as they have a storyline of their own. But each scene is literally two minutes long. There was a part in the movie displaying Kate Barlow's story. It then cuts to a twenty second clip of Hector Zeroni finishing up his hole, and then it cuts back to Kate's story. This ruins the pacing of the film. You can't have one sad scene, then one happy scene, then one sad scene all sandwiched into a sloppy meal. It all has to go by smoothly.3) Too much soundtrack. This is fine for me if the music is coming from a radio or something, but... there's just too many songs used. This also ruins the pacing of the movie.4) Too many philosophies. I love the use of philosophies in a film. That is, as long as they're all introduced, expanded, and wrapped up. Fate, love, curse, history, loss, and lust are just a few philosophies crammed into this film. This also messes up the pacing of the film. Sure, if the movie was three hours long, everything could be introduced and wrapped up nicely. For example, let's take Kate Barlow's story into account. We've got the philosophy of love between an African male and a caucasian female happening here. This philosophy was very brief. After Sam (the man Kate falls in love with) gets killed, we're introduced to the philosophy that loss can drive someone insane. Kate succumbed to this philosophy... which is what I like. But they should have had Stanley more beaten up by Zero's loss... have him close to suffering from Kate's fate. 5) This brings us to the conclusion that Stanley's character wasn't beaten up enough. All the conflict was directed towards Hector's character. This bugged me. Yeah, Stanley is sent to juvenile for a crime he didn't commit... and then nothing else happens to him the whole movie. In The Shawshank Redemption, Andy's character is in the same situation. However, his character is worn down to the bones; he gets raped, he's beaten near death, he's sent to the hole for months, he's almost thrown off a roof... I could go on forever. Conflict is what makes a movie good. Holes just... wasn't up to take the challenge.I'd say that this movie is a classic, but there are some holes that need to be filled: such as when Mr. Sir states that you'd die a slow and painful death if bitten by a yellow-spotted lizard... but Kate dies after being bit from one in literally seconds. This film is a little underrated (I thought it'd be at a 7.3 at least) but a 7/10 will do for the next couple of years.",Holes

The action begins when Stanley Yelnats is sent to a boys' prison camp, where all the inmates are forced to dig holes under the desert sun as a form of rehibilitation. But as the story progresses, Stanley's tale becomes interwoven with that of a legendary treasure, and this adventure becomes ten times more fun than any Disney movie about an all-boy prison camp has any right to be.

I thought since the screenplay was written by the novel's author it couldn't be too far from the book.I was sorely mistaken. This movie suffers from the same mistakes as the Harry Potter movies. All the thematical elements are there, the story is well served in matters of continuity and faithfulness to the book, but what was NOT there is the angst, the emotivity, the nail-biting tension that made the book so enjoyable.Too many things are removed from the original story to make the movie suitable for kids. The book was meant for young adults, age 13 and over, so I don't see the point in making this a PG rated movie. Miramax should have handled it, and it should have been rated PG-13, if only to be able to experience the rich character development that was almost totally neglected here. How? well, in the book Stanley suffered terribly througout his stay in Camp. The humor was dark and stemmed precisely from his suffering. He began to take things more lightheartedly as the story progressed and that's how he became happier.I was handling all the small changes very well untill the part when Stanley and Zero run away from camp. After that I started to get progressively more ticked off as the movie rolled towards the end. The boys look fresh as cucumbers as they head towards God's thumb. The time they spend there is severely shortened, and the evolution of their rock solid friendship seems extremely rushed. These elements were my favorite thing about the book, I was actually looking forward to watching the two boys overcome these increidible odds on the big screen, especially since they had proven by that point that they are both very good actors, but I was not to be so lucky.The whole second part of the movie just reeked horribly of Disney's ineffable hand tweaking at the script, not letting the main characters suffer too much, rushing through their biggest challenges, overexplaining, and overblowing elements that were supposed to be subtle.The best part of the movie were the actors. A terrific cast that was sadly misused for the most part, especially the youngsters. I look forward to seeing Khleo Thomas in future endeavours. All the flashback scenes were enchanting and very well handled though. Overall I hope the movie will compel more people to read the book, which is clearly superior to this movie adaptation. Overall I give it a 7 out of 10.",Holes

170,FirstWright,Keeping Racism Alive,1,20 July 2008,"Once again Disney spews it's racist programming upon the unsuspecting, impressionable young minds of children. If kids don't already have enough guilt and insecurity about who they are, Disney will tell them in this movie. I would go as far as to say that the American public has become such a sponge for politically correct spew, that they may not even realize that some are being called racist pigs. ""Holes"" does this in the form of guilt by association; In this case the common denominator is that the filthy villains are all Caucasians. Other people with different skin color should be equally aware and offended that this garbage seeks to further the 'cause' of racial division by accusing adults with light colored skin as being hateful, racist, non-compassionate, bumbling idiots.If you let your children view this type of propaganda, designed to guide their development, you should watch it with them. You should point out that the racial scenarios in this film are absolute nonsense, and that these type of situations have not occurred since the height of the KKK in the 40's and 50's, which happened to be about sixty years ago.The racism that occurred back then is inexcusable as is the complete nonsense that Disney and ABC continues to put on television to keep racism alive. Regardless of a person's skin color, this type of social programming is dangerous and will never lead to a 'colorblind' society. Disney should be ashamed of themselves for targeting children by further propagating racial separation by accusation.I view this film as absolute trash for the mind. I would never recommend this film except as a case study of modern social propaganda.",Holes
171,LOTR_Diva08,A great film for audiences of all ages,8,14 June 2003,"Holes, originally a novel by Louis Sachar, was successfully transformed into an entertaining and well-made film. Starring Sigourney Weaver as the warden, Shia Labeouf as Stanley, and Khleo Thomas as Zero, the roles were very well casted, and the actors portrayed their roles well.The film had inter-weaving storylines that all led up to the end. The main storyline is about Stanley Yelnats and his punishment of spending a year and a half at Camp Greenlake. The second storyline is about Sam and Kate Barlow. This plot deals with racism and it is the more deep storyline to the movie. The third is about Elya Yelnats and Madame Zeroni, which explains the 100-year curse on the Yelnats family. In my opinion, these storylines were weaved together very well.Contrary to many people's beliefs, I think that you do not have to have read the book to understand the movie. The film is reasonably easy to understand.
The acting in the film was well done, especially Shia Labeouf (Stanley), Khleo Thomas (Zero), Sigourney Weaver (the warden), and Jon Voight (Mr. Sir). The other members of D-Tent, Jake Smith (Squid), Max Kasch (Zig-Zag), Miguel Castro (Magnet), Byron Cotton (Armpit), and Brenden Jefferson (X-Ray), enhanced the comic relief of the movie. However, the best parts were with Zero and Stanley, who made a great team together.Although Holes is a Disney movie, it deals with some serious issues such as racism, shootings, and violence. The film's dramatization at some points is very well done.I would suggest this movie to people of all ages, whether they have read the book or not. You shouldn't miss it.",Holes

I thought this was going to be total crap, but to my surprise, `Holes' is a pretty good film with a lot of interesting and funny characters and a plot that deserves its name.  Sure, some scenes are quite unrealistic, the flashbacks are put in clumsily sometimes and the ending may be a bit too happy and sweet, but hey: this is a film for kids and I sure wasn't so critical when I was eleven or twelve. Besides: the Kissing Kate story is really cool and makes up for a lot of minor flaws. I mean, an ex-teacher going on an almost heroic killing- and robbing-spree after the small-minded village crooks have killed her black boyfriend and set her school on fire? That's not what movies for kids are usually made of.Ultimately, one of the film's qualities seems to be that even though it was meant for a young audience, it works just fine for adults.

It's just HARD to transition a novel to a movie, but talented ""Fugitive"" director Andrew Davis is well up to the task, and he scored one heck of a film!

Since I haven't read the book, I can't vouch for accuracy, but I have to say that Jon Voight was truly delightful. You liked the characters you were supposed to like, hated the ones you were supposed to hate, and laughed at the ones that were supposed to be funny.
I can see how some folks might not like this movie. It is tedious at times, especially in the beginning. All the flashbacks can be distracting (though they are essential to the story).

I thought it couldn't be good. I mean, the main character's resume consists mainly of the Disney Channel's mediocre Even Stevens series. Everyone on Disney gets a movie and most aren't setting the screen on fire, so I was sure I was in for a boring two hours.This film proved me wrong right from the beginning. The characters were well developed, the plot line was strong, the music added to the fun (rather than overwhelming the film), and there were good things here for adults as well as kids.All of the young actors in this film did an adequate job (or better in some cases). Shia LaBeouf was a believable every-kid thrust into a bizarre situation. I found myself caring about his character (Stanley) and about his aptly named friend Zero, played by Khleo Thomas. The supporting cast of other-kids were passable, none detracted greatly from the story. The best performances for me, as an adult at a kid film, were given by the older actors. Top of the list was Jon Voigt (Mr. Sir). He stole any scene he was in. Henry Winkler (Stanley's father) and Sigourney Weaver (Warden Walker) also showed well constructed characters with personality.
The film has a fair number of flashbacks to a historical back story and excellent performances by Patricia Arquette (Kissin' Kate) and Dule Hill (Sam the Onion Man).The story moves along smoothly and less than predictably, flashing back 100 years in a way that didn't even confuse my seven-year-old. There was an innocent and interesting love story and characters to care about, despise or mourn.The kid-oriented music was fun. I found myself moving to it. The songs actually added to the film rather than the movie being an excuse to sell a soundtrack like in so many of these kid driven films.All in all, a very enjoyable couple of hours. I was glad the family dragged me to it.One word of caution ...*****mild spoiler*****there is racially motivated violence in the back story. Although the crime is not displayed graphically, there is little doubt what happens. Again, my seven-year-old ""got it.""",Holes
189,Bam_is_hot,The best Movie this year,10,24 June 2003,I have seen the movie Holes and say that it has to be the best movie all year long. It brings out the child in everyone. I mean who would come up with the idea of having troublesome boys dig holes as their punishment? Louis Sachar thats who. Although the movie was different from the book it was still very good. For example Caveman/Stanley was supposed to be the biggest one there. Weight wise and height wise but ZigZag/Ricky was taller and Armpit/Theodore was bigger. Also X-Ray/Rex was supposed to be one of the smallest boys but wasn't. The only thing that I didn't like about the movie was that the flashbacks were rather persuasive and long. I would have rather seen more of the present than past but thats just my opinion. I especially like the work of the boys though. Like Squid/Alan who was played by Jake M.Smith was supposed to be a moody and tough kid. Jake M.Smith performed just that and did a great job at it as did almost all of the actors in Holes. So I would say if you havent seen Holes yet then you should definatly see it when it comes out again or you'll be missing out on a whole lotta fun.,Holes

Disgusting! Nobody would buy a thirst quencher called Splooge. Was this one of those attempts by the writers to slip in some humor for mom and dad over the kiddy's head?

The story sets up pretty quick, so don't be late.There is a lot of information that is told in a short period of time. What is particularly enjoyable is the audience is treated as if they have intelligence, as the director never bogs things down by making a point over and over again.The acting was very solid and thankfully the cast was allowed to take their characters outside of the stereotypes in which they had been cast...Also done very well is the transition in and out of scenes from the past. They never run too long, and they always give you a necessary piece of the puzzle. If you run out for popcorn, don't dally as you may miss a piece of the fabric that meshes the story together.The movie is for all ages, but it never strays far from being an adventure movie...the humor and the chills hits quickly and then they are gone...set up your expectations correctly and you should have a very good time.",Holes

I really enjoyed the scenes in the old scenes with Kate Barlow. Her character, along with Sam and Trout's characters were all really believable and pretty close to how I pictured them. Same with Stanley. Even though he wasn't chubby, his character was still cast well with LaBeouf. I also liked how closely the movie stayed with the book's plot and the music was also really fun. So, it was really good, but it's getting 8 stars mainly for Jon Voight's character, Mr. Sir. In the book, his character was really intimidating. Like if you were Stanley Yelnats, you would be shaking in your sneakers around this guy. That is who Mr. Sir is in the book. However, in the movie, Mr. Sir is rewritten as an melodramatic imbecile. The only redeeming scene with Mr. Sir was in the cafeteria where he was aggressively making sure no one commented on his scarred face. That was believable.

200,j-38820,Review of Holes,9,22 January 2020,"Stanley Yelnats VI (Shia LaBeouf) is falsely accused of a crime he didn't commit, and sent to Camp Green Lake correctional facility. Before leaving for camp his grandpa explains that his family is cursed because of his great great grandfather. When Stanley arrives he is met with the camp doctor Dr. Pendanski (Tim Blake Nelson) who introduces him to a gang of boys that tease and push him around for being the new kid. Warden Walker (Sigourney Weaver) forces Stanley and the other boys to dig holes every single day to build their character. They eventually realize that the warden is making them dig holes because she is searching for something. As the movie continues there are three intertwining storylines that lead to the mystery of the Yelnats curse and the treasure the warden is looking for.Throughout the film many scenes are enhanced using music. As an example, when Stanley is contemplating stealing Mr. Sir's (Jon Voight) truck there is no music and it's only the sound of the boys fighting used to build up the suspense. Then as Stanley turns the keys it switches to fast tempo country song as he drives away. The music continues as Stanley crashes the truck and runs away, but as he's running the music switches as the heat of the desert hits him.There are many scenes where good audio choices were used, an example of good audio choices is when the African American onion farmer Sam (Dulé Hill) continues to fix Ms. Barlow's (Patricia Arquette) schoolhouse and they slowly fall in love. The audio of squeaky doors and leaking roofs allows the watcher to get submersed in the movie. It is especially impactful as the slow eerie music grows as Charles Walker (Scott Plank) kills Sam in his boat and you can hear the gunshot echo through the mountains.As you watch the movie you'll notice a decent amount of jumping around in the past and present. The transition between this timeline are smooth and fit with the movie but can get confusing at some points as to how far in the past the viewer is sent.As I watched the movie, I came across a lot of linking ends that made the movie lock together. An example is the link between the Yelnats and Zeroni families. Madame Zeroni put a curse on the Yelnats family because Elya Yelants, Stanley's great great grandfather forgot to carry Madame Zeroni to the top of the mountain called God's Thumb. Near the end of the movie Stanley ends up carrying Zero to the top of the mountain and ending the Yelnats family curse. God's Thumb also links back to Sam because that is where he grew his special onions. The onions relate back to Stanley and Zero because the onions prevent the deadly yellow-spotted lizard from killing them.The movie constantly keeps the viewer engaged and is a balance of laughter and tears. It is also very entertaining because of the cast chosen for this film. All the young actors like Shia LaBeouf, Khleo Thomas, Brenden Jefferson, keep the laughs coming, and do an excellent job keeping the movie real.",Holes
201,rothaug@optonline.net,"Great story, touching and fun acting accomplished by the cast!",9,27 October 2002,"I have been reading the book with my students, and got the opportunity to see a preview showing of this film. I signed a promise not to reveal specifics, but I can say it follows the Newbery Award-winning book's plot well. Of course, it should, because the author, Louis Sachar, was also the writer of the screenplay! Veteran actors join some very talented young people to tell an adventure story everyone will enjoy.  I recommend this movie to kids over the age of nine, young people, ""twenty somethings"", and even the ""grown-ups""!I commend the Disney Studio for producing this film, and recognizing a story everyone should see (and read!)",Holes

Never mentioned any other children or wife prior to his speaking with and falling in love with the teacher? Maybe she had a child prior to becoming the kissing Kate Bandit? Even with the mistakes in the movie. Just loved it. The acting was great. Not sure where the story was with Mr. Sir being Marion a women at the end but makes his character even funnier.

This is an adventure based on heart-warming friendships. Especially between Stanley and Zero. I like to go along with Stanley and the other denizens at the camp. It appears to be a simple Disney kid's film, but turns into much more.

The music is not fitting for the segments where it plays and the lyrics just make it distracting, it's like they were just ""oh we need some music here, what's on the charts right now?"", and don't get me started on the stupid choppy slow-mo shots.On a whole the movie is alright, it's not bad, but there are as many plot holes and inconsistencies as there are actual holes and the post- production is sub-par even for kids movies.You can make a kids movie without it feeling like it was made by the very kids it's made for.",Holes

This film has a certain way of storytelling that keeps you hooked throughout, until the end where everything is pulled together for a great ending. I also love the way this is directed, by flashing back and forth between the modern day and Stanley's ancestors' stories.

Today I decided to re-watch the movie because it's been such a long time since the last time I'd watched it, and because - if asked - I wouldn't have been able to tell you who played the lead role (Shia LaBoeuf -in case you were wondering). While watching the movie, I realized that not only was it a perfect depiction of the novel (down to the last words), but it was also an amazing story. The themes portrayed in this unique Disney movie were not the typical happy and fluffy topics breached in most Disney movies. They were complex, harsh and yet still completely okay for children to understand and grasp. I advise anyone who has not seen this movie to go and rent it from your local video store ASAP (and bring your kids, friends, spouses etc. along).

The film plays with it's timline, jumping back and forth from Lake Greenwood in the past and Lake Greenwood in the present.  Since I didn't read the book, I felt a little confused at times.  I certainly felt like I was having information overload.  However, the ending is quite satisfying and ties up both storyline threads well.

There were differences, of course, but except for one minor omission, they weren't differences that had me sitting up and arguing with the movie.  I like that!  I go to see movies made from books because I loved the books, and want to expand on the experience, not change it totally. In spite of a confusing blend of timelines the audience's attention is never given a chance to wander, and by the end of the film, all of the connections are made clear. There are some scenes which are startling, and some which younger children will find downright frightening, but may not be able to explain afterwards.  In spite of its fantastic elements, the threats and issues the move deals with are often realistic.  Parents of under-7s will want to preview this movie for their children.

In the book, the characters are rich and flavorful, as if Sacher tapped into the El Dorado of character development. The actors in the movie deliver nothing less in their performances. You never endure droughts of inspiration, or have to wait through insipid acting just to see the one good actor in the whole flick.

It seems that he read the book in 5th grade (now in 7th) and loved it. I haven't read the book, but if it anything like the movie I give it the high ratings. The story line combines the theme of worlds colliding, the theory of six degrees of separation between all of us, and an opportunity to root for the underdog (and cheer when they overcome their obstacles), which kept my husband interested who rarely is able to sit through an entire Disney movie.

239,jay-b117,An engaging movie,8,12 September 2013,"The film 'Holes' is an enthralling film based on the novel by Louis Sachar. It is a film that people would only understand if they decipher the underlying meaning. Through the cooperation of the director(Andrew Davis)and the stars,(Shia LeBouf, Sigourney Weaver, Jon Voight and Khleo Thomas)they have accomplished something that will stay in your mind long after you have watched it.The story revolves around the main character, Stanley, who is sent to juvenile camp for a crime he did not commit. Once at Camp Green Lake, the juvenile camp, Stanley was given strict enforcements and was thrown into a position that he was not used to. The campers had to rouse at dawn and dig for almost the rest of the day whilst the sinister rays of the sun beamed down on their tanned faces beaded with perspiration. Due to the fact that Stanley was obese, none of the campers accepted him and Stanley was neglected. As time dragged on, there began to be a friendship with the campers, and a special bond between Stanley and Zero.After making a deal with Zero, there is a rift in Stanley's friendship, causing Zero to run away and Stanley follows soon after, in search for Zero. After finding Zero, they embark on a treacherous ascent up Big Thumb, a mountain they believe would have a source water and possibly also food. After that, there is an abrupt turn of events that results in Stanley and Zero going home.Due to the stunning performance by the actors, it seemed as if the movie engulfed the viewer and the viewer was participating in it. Shia LeBouf conjured a realistic representation of Stanley. However, a minor difference was that in the novel Stanley was obese whereas in the movie he is quite fit. Another actor who played an important character was Sigourney Weaver, who managed to create the perfect stern impression of the Warden.The techniques used in this film are mainly compromised of flashbacks. The use of flashbacks assist the viewer in in clarifying some unanswered questions. Without the flashbacks, the movie would not be understood.This movie is a well sequenced movie that uses visual elements like flashbacks. Feelings of sympathy and empathy will overcome you which later become feelings of joy and euphoria.",Holes

This film is based off the book. Holes is a very enjoyable movie, with part drama, part comedy, and part action. It is about a boy name Stanley Yelnats IV, he was a teenage boy that was born to a family that was supposed to been cursed for several years. He chose to go to the juvenile detention camp. This juvenile facility is in the desert. The judge sent Stanley to Camp Green Lake. Instead of an actual camp, however, they had to dig a five foot hole every day. They are told it is to help them develop character. The reason for going to Camp Green Lake was to change Stanley from bad to a good boy. No one should be punished for a crime if not sure that person actually committed it.Stanley was falsely arrested by two police that accused him of stealing a pair of baseball shoes from a famous baseball player. In court Stanley was sentenced to eighteen months in a juvenile detention camp or was to be imprisoned. He was sent to Camp Green Lake. While at the juvenile facility Stanley had met someone by the name of Hector Zeroni. At Camp Green Lake Stanley and Hector became friends. Hector was also known by his nickname which was ""Zero."" Hector help Stanley learn to read and also helped him dig up his holes. There was a family curse throughout the movie which Stanley always finds himself 'in the wrong place at the wrong time'. For example, when a pair of flying shoes hit Stanley on the head and marks the beginning of his journey to Camp Green Lake. These shoes are shown throughout the film as they represent the 'curse' on Stanley's family and the family business of 'trying to get rid of the smelly feet. The Warden of Camp Green Lake has her own ideas about rehabilitation. While well-mannered counselor tries to help the boys however he can. The Warden's right hand man is a heartless creep who enjoys making Stanley and his friends suffer. Before long, Stanley wonders if there is a good reason why the Warden seem so curious about what the boys find while their digging. The Warden mistreated the juveniles who were in facility. However, Hector and Stanley spot a rock formation something in the distance and head for it when Hector suddenly faints. With Stanley knowing that this could be their only way of ditching the juvenile facility he picks Hector up and continue moving toward the rock. They finally reach the top of the mountain and find water. Finally, while Stanley hold Hector while he drinks water, he sings to him. He realizes that his curse has been broken. Later after Hector is woken up he reveals that he is the reason Stanley was sent to Camp Green Lake. Once officially released from the camp, they decide to go back to discover the hole where Stanley found the tube of lipstick and uncover a rusty old chest. This movie was based on a boy who was blamed for a crime that he did not even commit and done time for someone else. But while in Camp Green Lake he made new friends and learned to stand up for himself. But from this movie, you learn that the ones you call your friends can be the ones that gets you in a situation.",Holes

Miguel Castro is so fit!I don't think there are many films that are better than this. Seriously. It has a great plot, script and storyline and I think it's great that Louis Sachar decided to not only be the screen writer but also be in the actual movie as well, because most actor just usually go I don't want anything to do with this.

246,MactheKnife,Had the potential to be a cult classic...,7,14 January 2006,"Had Holes been made by anyone else apart from Disney, and given a 15+ rating, I truly believe it could've been a cult classic along the lines of ""Donnie Darko"" The acting by Shia LaBeouf (Stanley ""Caveman"" Yelnats) was second to none, but it seems that lately he has been reduced to playing the wisecracking smart one liner sidekick in recent films such as Max in Charlie's Angels, Farber in I, Robot and Chas in Constantine, which has now kind of typecast him in this role. Don't get me wrong, i happened to flick over onto this film, and it was enjoyable enough to keep me routed to my seat for the duration, but i couldn't help but be very disappointed with the Hollywood ending. The film missed the market it was aimed at, as kids may get bored with the huge focus on character development throughout the film. Had it of been a higher rating (15+), showed the realism, and brutality, of juvenile detention centres, and changed the awful ending to something less cheesy, I truly believe we would have had a cult classic.",Holes
247,smokyjo,defending holes,10,21 June 2005,"I know i'm late to the game but hey! That's life! I feel i have to defend this little masterpiece as a film that gets you more involved with each viewing. Whilst i agree t with GuRpZ's assertion that you have to have read the book first to understand the intricate paths of fate and multiple narrative, i disagree that it leaves the viewer confused and can't be enjoyed.Zigzag, Armpit, Barfbag etc. are peripheral characters that shouldn't hold your gaze - they're there as symbols for the hierarchy of a detention camp. What should hold your attention are the little hooks that are left for you to catch sight of and this is probably where prior knowledge is useful. Saying that, everything doesn't become apparent on first reading of the book - it makes you work without labouring over it - and that can only be a good thing, can't it? Basically, there are three narratives within the film: Stanley's, The Warden's and Zero's. How the trio's lives are meant to cross is told through flashback to 100 years previous and the three's present day involvement,( By the way, what is a ""large story point?""??). It keeps the theme of fate bubbling under the surface for the entire film but it is subtle and credits the viewer with some intelligence at being able to work out how carrying a pig up a mountain is linked to a place called ""God's Thumb"". However, it is just as enjoyable to watch as a straightforward piece of entertaining narrative that doesn't schmaltz - OK, i admit Disney got their ""happy ever after"" in the finale.That's all apart from the comment about the top of the mountain. As a fan of Davies' directing - NOT- i give him credit for sticking to one of the most important themes in the film and not creating a ""lush Oasis"". All i'll say is ""Know your onions!""!! NB Top soundtrack too.",Holes

Well, no surprise! The movie is just as good as the novel.First, Shia LaBoeuf is incredibly good in bringing to life the main character Stanley Yelnats. Except for the fact that he was supposed to be a fat kid before going to Camp Green Lake, his acting deserves great recognition. He is believable as a 14 year old kid who lacks confidence and who finally evolves into a more mature teenager. Digging holes finally made a difference for him.Another aspect that I liked is the well-chosen songs for the soundtrack. Whether it's Shaggy's Keep 'N It Real or the cast singing Dig It, it really adds rhythm to the movie.Just hurry, this movie is a must for everyone. Especially if you read the book.Master G",Holes

This movie occurs over a hundred years in a Texas desert, but the movie has been filmed in the mountain of California. Stanley Yelnats a 14 years old boy who has bad luck because of a curse, is sent to Camp Green Lake, a detention camp, for a crime that he did not commit. Stanley and the other boys at the camp are forced to dig big holes every day to build character. Stanley will eventually understand that they aren't digging to build character; they are searching a specific thing. Who will Stanley meet and what will he find at CampGreen Lake?The costumes of the movie were really realistic. If it would have been in real life, I really would have thought that they were in detention. The boys wore orange overalls with a white or black shirt underneath. The costumes were stained with brown because they were digging in the dirt and it gives them a criminal look.The movie didn't bring to life the characters from the book. To be honest, the movie was a little bit boring compared to the book. In the book Stanley is a big guy and he is bullied at school. We didn't see that part in the movie and Stanley wasn't big at all. The fact they changed the character that much really bothers me because I didn't expect this.I did not hate the film but I did not love it. Like I said there were some parts that were missing in the movie. I recommend this movie to people who love comedy and western movies.

This movie was rated 7.1 stars on the website IMDb. Andrews Daws was the director of Holes.In this movie, Stanley Yelnats IV is the principal characters of the movie. He is the teem who did not have a lucky life and he was sent to Camp Green Lake, a boys detention center where he is going to have some friends and where he will dig some holes for build his character. But in the unlucky life of Stanley, an holes will bring good luck to Stanley (but to know what is the lucky thing, you have to watch the movie). Stanley do that adventure with his new good friend Zero.For the fan of Shia Leboeuf, he has the role of the principal characters of Holes, Stanley, he did a great job to interpret Stanley. But another actor to, did a great job to interpret another personage, she is a woman, Sigourney Weaver, she had the role of the Warden, the warden is the person who runs the Camp Green Lake. And Khleo Thomas had the role of Zero, the new good friend of Stanley, this two guys do an adventure together.In this movie, the actor did a great job, the movie I like the history Holes (book), they seem realistic with some beautiful costumes.

There are others characters like Zero, the best friend of Stanley (Khleo Thomas), Mr. Pendanski, the consul of the group D (Tim Blake Nelson), Mr. Sir the most important person in the camp after the warden and finally the warden (Sigounny Weaver). Holes is a drama adventure comedy movie. The movie take place at Camp Green Lake in the Texas desert. The director of the movie is Andrew Davis Stanley is a fat guy who was bullied in school, he has been put in a camp for bad boys because he stole a pair of shoes. He think it's the fault of his great-great-grand-father. In the camp, he has to dig one hole for all the day. Mr. Sir always say that they are here to build character. But there is no lake at camp green lake. People who lived at camp green lake are scared of yellow-spotted lizard, if you a yellow-spotted lizard bite you, you'll die in a slow and painful death.The book was a little bit different from the movie, the book has a lot of more details. For example, when Stanley finally found Zero, in the desert, he was under a boat, but in the book he was in a dark and long tunnel. In the book Zero was a fat and bullied guy but in the movie, he wasn't fat and they didn't say that he was a bullied guy. In the book they said what happened to camp green lake after Stanley go back to home but in the movie they didn't say anything.The soundtrack was very good, when the actors don't talk or when they are doing important think they put a music (when Kate Barlow was stealing bunks). They put mostly country music. There is also a music created especially for Holes (Dig It).I liked the book. I would give him 4 stars because the story was very good, the soundtrack was also very good. I don't like the quality of the film. I think it's because the movie is a little bit old. There was also little thing very improbable. Zero is the best digger in the camp but he's the smallest one.

Also, when the bus drives we don't listen the sound of the motor.The book and the movie was different. Example, in the movie book they said what Zero and Stanley did when they escape from the camp, but in the film we saw only where they went. Also, in the book they explain when Stanley and other boys were in the room and in the movie they did not just explain what happened.I think that movie was very good, but lack of information that are in the book.

Louis Sachar is the one who wrote the book that was based on to make the movie. The movie lasts 117 minutes. Everything started at Camp Green Lake in Texas in a contemporary timeStanley Yelnats has a weird family : he is Stanley Yelnats the fourth and his father is trying to find a way to recycle sneakers. Everything is going ''normally'' until one day : Stanley is accused of stealing Clyde Livingston's shoes (they are really famous) and between going to jail or to Camp Green Lake, Stanley chooses Camp Green Lake (a juvenile detention center). At Camp, nothing seems normal : the boys have to dig holes all day long and Stanley is sure that the Warden is looking for something and the digging is just an excuse to search for what she's looking for. One day, Zero ( a friend of Stanley's) takes off and Stanley goes looking for him. Together, the make it to God's thumb (a mountain), Zero confessed something to Stanley that might change everything between them and they find out the whole truth about that place and themselves.The movie scenes are a lot similar to the book's script. The actors say the exact same thing as the book's characters. The events happen at the good time and the chronological order is respected as well. The necessary lines of the book are in the movie and the unnecessary ones aren't there. It's a great thing.The soundtrack is also very nice. The music suits the story and the concept. For example, the song ''Dig it'' suits the movie in a perfect way. Plus, the name of the band who sung it is ''D-Tent'' like in the movie ( Stanley and Zero are in the D-Tent). The music is great and well associated to the movie.I really like the movie Holes. It is really great and the cast is very good. The actors learnt their lines and it shows. I read the book and when I watched the movie, it was the exact same thing. There are just little differences (skipped parts). Usually, the books are way better than the movies, but this time, the movie is better. It seemed a little old, because it was in the desert and the visual effects weren't extraordinary. While watching the movie, I felt attached to the characters and to the story. I would give the movie a 8/10 rate, because it is well done, but perfection does not exist and it was not the best movie I watched, either.

At his trial, he will have to choose: go to the jail or go at Camp Green Lake digging holes, but he finally chose the camp. He said that everything happens to him is because of his no-good-dirty-rotten-pig-stealing-great-great-grandfather because he has not fulfilled his promise, condemning his family to a curse: be at the wrong place at the wrong time. His stay at the camp will be perilous, especially with the people around him. But can he overcome all challenges face him?Holes is also a book. The book is written by Louis Sachar. The film and the book are both similar but are also different. In the film, actors says the same things that is written in the book and the events are chronological. The only differences I found is the fact that the book is more detailed and that Stanley is bigger in the book than in the movie.The soundtrack was well done and well chosen. Indeed, the film songs like ""Dig it"" by Mickey Fitzpatrick did perfectly the link between it and the movie. ""I will survive"" by Stephany Bentley referred the difficulty that subjected boys at the Camp Green Lake and ""I'm gonna run"" referred when Zero and Stanley ran. Finally, I really liked the movie because the story was well told and well played by actors. Moreover, the decor and the soundtrack were realistic. I recommend this movie for all people because the story and the moral of the film are touching. The film can be suitable for all viewers because it is without any violence, rudeness and vulgarity.

262,maxirousseau,"Holes, What A Good Movie!",10,29 March 2016,"Holes was released in 2003. The main character is Stanley Yelnats, known as Shia Laboeuf. There are other characters that you'll see a lot in this movie as Sigourney Weaver (Warden), Jon Voigt (Mr.Sir), Tim Blake Nelson (Mr.Pendanski) and Khleo Thomas (Zero). The story was set in Texas, on a dry lake named Camp Green Lake. The film is a really great adventure story with many ancestors twists in it.Holes is a story about a camp that builds character for bad boys. What makes them build a good character is that they must dig a hole five foot long and five foot wide, each day. All 'campers' are aware of hot sun, but they are mostly aware of yellow-spotted lizards. If you get bit by one of these, you will die from a slow and painful death The director of the film is Andrew Dawis and he did a really good job.The film was really COOL to watch, because all actors did well. I really enjoyed it! I spotted two little differences between the book and the film such as Stanley Yelnats (Shia Laboeuf) was fat in the book and the Warden (Sigourney Weaver) has red hairs in the book but they are not like in the film. Except these two little things, I could see who was who right away, while watching the movie. Costumes were good, not the best but good. Obviously 'campers' had hard days, we could see that they had horrible days, they were all dirty after doing their hard job.I think that there could have been special effects in this movie. They could have put one, when the gypsy puts down a curse on Stanley's family. That's the only idea I could think of for special effects, other than that, I don't see where there could have been other special effects.I really enjoyed Holes, because everything is related too something. Also there is a good suspense and mysterious things that happens during the movie. I think that every body between 8-100 can watch it, there is nothing that is not for children, in this movie. Also, I really liked the fact that there are some flashbacks in the film and in the book too.Rating: 10 Stars Maximilien 202",Holes

At this camp he had just one friend Zeron and they were really close but one day Zero screwup from the camp and Stanley was really worried. So Stanley did go to the desert to search Zero and get him back. will he get him back?The costumes of this movie are very nice they're like prison uniform.

264,amelieraymondchitaya,Unusual Disney movie!,8,29 March 2016,"Holes is a film who was released in 2003. It's an adventure-dramatic-comedy. An unknown desert in Texas is the place where the story takes place. The length of the movie is 117 minutes.So, basically it's the story in the 90's of a boy named Stanley Yelnats who was wrongly accused and had to choose either to go to jail or either to go to a detention centre for boys to purge his sentence (Camp Green Lake is the name of the centre).He chooses the camp, but it wasn't like he thought it was going to be; it was a camp in the middle of a desert where other misfits and him had to dig a hole every day. In Stanley's digging group, the boys had all bizarre nicknames like: Armpit, X-Ray and Zero; Stanley made friends with Zero and in exchange of reading lessons, Zero helped Stanley to dig his holes; but the Warden wasn't happy about it, so Zero suddenly ran away! When he saw this, Stanley also ran away to find his friend; while doing that he realizes that Camp Green Lake is hiding a treasure and that is why they are all digging. Will Stanley and Zero survive alone in the desert; and if they both do, will they find that lost treasure of the mystery lake;Here are the questions that will be answered by watching this film.The cast has a lot of great and popular actors. For example: Shia Laboeuf (Stanley), Sigourner Weaver (The Warden), Jon Voigt (Mr. Sir), Tim Blake Nelson (Mr. Pendanski) or Khleo Thomas (Zero).I really liked all of those actors and they were really good in this movie. The director is Andrew Davis who directed a lot of other movies like Fugitive.There isn't a lot of differences between the movie and the novel, in my opinion, because Louis Sachar (The author of the novel) also wrote the script. He wrote the script of the movie because he wanted the film and the novel to be similar. So, it's a lot like the novel.I thought that the movie was pretty good. I thought that the special effects weren't that good but the songs were very good. They were put at the perfect time to make a really good atmosphere. I also liked that the title of movie has not only a real meaning(Stanley digs holes most of the time) but also a symbolic meaning (Stanley's hole in his life). So, if you like adventure but also drama and flash-backs to explain what's happening in the movie, Holes is the perfect movie for you to watch!Amélie 201",Holes

I hear «I will survive» when we learn more about Katherine Barlow. I think that the music can make a movie better, like for Holes,without the music this film might be boring.I really like this movie. The book was great and the film was also great. I don't know if it's because of the cast or the screenplay (Louis Sachar) but I didn't recognize the classic Disney movie,fortunately !

Jon Voight plays Mr.Sir and Tim Blake is playing Mr.Pendanski in this movie. Holes takes place in a big Texas desert in United-States. This movie happens in modern times.Stanley is getting arrested because he had been accused , So he went to Camp Green Lake, a detention center for minors. Then, he meets Zero, the smallest kid of his group. They become good friends and Stanley gives him reading lessons, Stanley finds a gold tube, in a hole (every campers of Camp Green Lake has to dig a five feet deep hole every day to build character), that has KateBarlow written on it (Kate Barlow is a famous outlaw that lived one-hundred years ago at Camp Green Lake). Stanley has some problems with members of his group, Zero escapes Camp Green Lake because he's tired to be maltreated by Mr.Pendanski and everyone in his group, Stanley found him in the desert and they decide to go back to camp to dig one more hole.They are going to dig the hole where Stanley found the gold tube because they have a good reason to think that there is Kate Barlow's loot in it.There is a lot of differences and similarities between the Holes book and its movie. The most important difference is that there is a lot more details in the book than in the movie. Ex: In the movie, Stanley isn't fat but in the book, he is. Ex: In the book, Mr.Sir has a rattlesnake tattoo on his arm, in the movie he hasn't. There is a lot of similarities too, but I would prefer Holes movie if there was even more. Ex: The warden has cowboy boots in both.The costumes of the movie are pretty realistic because they are adapted to the lifestyle of actors. Ex: There is dirt on their clothes. Ex: Some campers have a piece of cloth on their neck to protect them from the sun.I loved this movie because I had a lot of feelings when I watched it. The movie has a lot of qualities but there is also some flaws. It has been made really well because it's very similar to the book. If you want to watch Holes, I recommend you to be sure that you can concentrate your mind on it,to understand it and to appreciate it just like I did.

This movie is a book adaption of Holes, wrote by Louis Sachar.It's the story of young boy who was sent in a juvenile camp in Texas. The really popular Shia LaBeouf was the main character in the movie when he was 17 years old which is really interesting when you play a 13 years old boy.It's about a 13 years old boy, Stanley IV, who was sent to a juvenile camp, Camp Green Lake for a crime he didn't commit. The campers have to dig a five feet deep and five feet wide hole every day. Stanley always had bad luck due to a curse on his great- great- grandfather. Stanley will realise that the Warden don't actually make them dig holes to build character but for something else way more interesting! As I said, Holes is a book adaptation. I highly recommend you to read the book because for most, the book is always better than the movie. Everything in the book is well explained and the emotions are there too. The book and the movie are pretty similar there are just some details that are different. By example, Stanley wasn't big in the beginning of the story like he did on the book. On the other hand, the producer did a very good job to recreate the environment of Camp Green Lake and chose well the actors in the movie.The cast includes Shia LaBeouf who plays Stanley IV, the main character. LaBeouf is wonderful actor; he has to act as Stanley, the 13 years old boy. You wouldn't believe he was 17 years old when he played in the movie! The cast also includes Louis Sachar as a bald man; he's the author of the book. He is just in a walk-on part of the movie. These actors were really into their characters, it's really impressive. They really deliver their scripts with a lot of emotions. They are entertaining and surely experimented. And Sigourney Weaver, the one who played the Warden was really good in her acting. She really seemed to be mean and it's really hard to do. As we can see in other movies, being mean is not the easiest thing to do. Overall, the actors didn't disappoint me in any way.I truly recommend watching the movie or reading the book because it's really unique and entertaining. The soundtrack, the way Holes was filmed and mostly, the actors were awesome. The producer and all the staff did a really good job to entertain us until the very end.

The principal actor is Shia Lebeouf, he also played in other famous movies. I very like him because I saw his evolution, before in Holes and ''now'' in Transfomer.It's the history of a ''bad boy'' (Stanley Yelnats), he was accused to did a crime, he did not commit so Stanley need to go at a junevile detention camp. But all is bad luck, it's the fault of is great-great grandfather. AT Camp Green Lake, all the boys need to dig holes for build character, when Stanley do that, he met his best friend, Zero. Stanley realize they only dig holes for the Warden because she want to find something. You need to see holes because the morals are super good. The book are more details but I prefer the movie because the film has more action.In general, all the actors were nice. They play their roles realistically and it's super important for me because if it's not realistic, I don't follow the movie. It's like I see this in front on me,it's genial. Shia Lebeouf, Jon Voigh, Tim Blake Nilson, Earther Kitt, Patricia Arquette, Dulé Hill, Rick Fox and Henry Winkler in Holes. They play bad boys or people who work at Camp Green Lake.I don't know who did the costume but they were great. The costumes were realistic with all the little details. A lot of movie don't do that and it's super important. All the little details was there and the prison ''stucks'' too.Finally, I like this movie more then the book. The book was boring for me but the movie was the opposite. See the images of the movie make more energy. I like the movie because it was realistic, funny and the morals was great-great. This film teach the children a lot of lessons. I like the movie like that because they are in intention. I advise holes at the person who have 12 years or 13 years, they can catch the morals and learn about this.Gab Quezada 202",Holes

At this moment, the police's sure Stanley stole them, so the boy is arrested and sent to a detention camp in the desert of Texas, Camp Green Lake. The teenager is sure that it's because of a curse from his no-good-dirty-rotten-pig-stealing great-great-grandfather. During his sojourn, Stanley make himself a friend, Zero. One day, Zero decides to escape from Camp Green Lake, where's no lake, and Stanley decides to go with him, in the middle of the desert, in a mountain named 'God's Thumb'.There are a lot of differences between the movie and the original novel, but I like the way there's also a lot of similarities. Example, Camp Green Lake's situated in the desert like in the book, the Warden's red haired, X-Ray isn't tall and the donkey of Sam, the onion man, is named Mary Lou. In contrary, in the movie, Stanley lives in Texas, but in the book, he lives in California. Also, in the movie, Stanley's a slim boy, but in the book, he's an over-weighted boy.Then, I really like the 3D effects of the Yellow-Spotted lizards because they don't seem so realistic in 2016, but for a movie from the starting of the 2000's, it's a good job. It's better than some effects of 2015's movies.Finally, I think Holes is a good movie for kids under 11 years old.

Secondly, I really like the fact that there is family lies in the movie: Zero and Madame Zeroni, The warden and trout walker, etc.Finally I think that it's a really good movie because the story is interesting, the actors played very well, etc.Yassine 202",Holes
280,epix-28703,A hole to fill,9,30 March 2016,"This film is a 2003 movie based on a book called holes. The movie is truthful to the book because the screenplay and the author of the book are the same. The cast of the film includes Shia Laboeuf, Sigouvery Weaver and a lot of other super good actors. The movie was shooted in the desert of California. This adventure, comedy, drama film is about an unlucky guy named Stanley. Because of his bad luck, Stanley will be send to the Camp Green Lake, a camp for youngs criminals. But, something is strange with the Camp Green Lake: there is no lake at the camp. Stanley and his new friend Zero will find out what's wrong with the camp and will go in search for the lost treasure of the outlaw Kissin Kate Barlow. There, his bad luck will becomes luck, his solitude will become company and his family will become rich. As I said,the movie is rather truthful to the book but some aspects aren't so faithful at all. Like at the end of the story, Stanley and Zero are stuck in a hole with dangerous spotted lizared around them. In the book their moves are slow, for not afraids the venomous lizard but in the film he moves with speed for get out of the hole. Some characters aren't faithful to the book too, like Stanley is supposed to be a big but he is medium hight.The landscapes of the movie are beautiful and sometimes realistic. I said ''sometimes'' because at a specific time in the movie, when Stanley climbs a mountain, the camera revolves around him and the background landscape moves to fast compare to Stanley. I found this movie very cool, the story is rather faithful to the book, the landscapes are great and the actors are good. Even though, I recommend to read the book before seeing the movie to have a better understanding of the story.Andre 202",Holes

In this weird camp he will meet a bunch of new people with various nicknames and faces that scares you like Mr. Sir and Armpit. The movie follows Stanley in his way out of the camp and about the old rumor that flies around the weird Camp Green Lake.The film's music includes a lot of people who sang for this movie like the D-Tent boys that was the actor in the movie.

I recommend this movie for a young public and for the family cause it's a funny film and is good for a little ''Cinema'' night in family. I give a 7/10 for this movie; it was great but not awesome.Aghiles 202",Holes
283,romanevezina,Watch this movie !,8,12 April 2016,"Holes is a 2003 adventure movie in Texas. The lenght of the movie is 117 minutes. The cast includes Shia LaBoeuf (Stanley), Sigourney Weaver (The Warden), Jon Voight(Mr.Sir), Tim Blake Nelson (Mr. Pendanski) and Khleo Thomas (Zero).Stanley Yelnats IV is arrested for stealing Clyde Livingston's shoes so he's sent to Camp Green Lake, a detention camp. At the camp, he meets Mr. Sir, Mr. Pendanski, The Warden and some boys who commit crimes too. Stanley have to dig holes all day for building characters but does it the real reason for why they're digging holes...The movie is very similar to the book even if they're not all the details from the book. When I read the book, I found that the story was a little bit complicated to understand but when I saw the movie, it was really easy to understand the story. That's why I prefer the movie. On the other hand, the characters are not like I imagine them. Example, Stanley is tall and heavy in the book, but in the movie, he's rather thin.Initially, Richard Kelly wrote the screenplay for the movie, but it was a dark and violent adaptation of the book, in a post-apocalyptic world. The studio reject it because it was too violent for a children's movie. Finally, Louis Sachar, the author of the book, wrote the screenplay.I really like the movie. The movie is very similar to the book but it's easier to understand. I recommend this movie for all the family except the young children because some scenes could be scary for them. I also recommend to read the book because the book is great too.Romane 202",Holes
284,ylaetitia-64495,Fill the holes or dig them?,8,13 April 2016,"Released in 2003, Holes is a movie that contains drama and comedy. The prominent stars of the movie are Shia LaBoeuf (Stanley), Sigourney Weaver (Warden), Jon Voigt (Mr.Sir), Tim Blake Nelson (Mr. Pendanski) and Khleo Thomas (Zero). Louis Sachar is the one who wrote the book that was based on to make the movie. The movie lasts 117 minutes. Everything started at Camp Green Lake in Texas in contemporary times.Stanley Yelnats has a weird family : he is Stanley Yelnats the fourth and his father is trying to find a way to recycle sneakers. Everything is going ''normally'' until one day : Stanley is accused of stealing Clyde Livingston's shoes (they are really famous) and between going to jail or to Camp Green Lake, Stanley chooses Camp Green Lake (a juvenile detention center). At Camp, nothing seems normal : the boys have to dig holes all day long and Stanley is sure that the Warden is looking for something and the digging is just an excuse to search for what she's looking for. One day, Zero ( a friend of Stanley's) takes off and Stanley goes looking for him. Together, the make it to God's thumb (a mountain), Zero confessed something to Stanley that might change everything between them and they find out the whole truth about that place and themselves.The movie scenes are a lot similar to the book's. The actors say the exact same thing as the book's characters. The events happen at the good time and the chronological order is respected as well. The necessary lines of the book are in the movie and the unnecessary ones aren't there. It's a great thing.The soundtrack is also very nice. The music suits the story and the concept. For example, the song ''Dig it'' suits the movie in a perfect way. Plus, the name of the band who sang it is ''D-Tent'' like in the movie ( Stanley and Zero are in the D-Tent). The music is great and well associated to the movie.I really like the movie Holes. It is really great and the cast is very good. The actors learnt their lines and it shows. I read the book and when I watched the movie, it was the exact same thing. There are just little differences (skipped parts). Usually, the books are way better than the movies, but this time, the movie is better. It seemed a little old, because it was in the desert and the visual effects weren't extraordinary. While watching the movie, I felt attached to the characters and to the story. I would give the movie a 8/10 mark, because it is well done, but perfection does not exist and it was not the best movie I watched, either. Anyways, I would recommend it to a public that is between ten and fifteen years old who likes adventure, drama and comedy all mixed up in a movie.Laetitia 203",Holes

Holes is an adventure ad drama comedy. The film is directed by Andrew Daws who made other good movies like Le fugitive. Holes is a movie based on a book of the same name. The book is writ by Louis Sachar. He has a little role on the beginning and the end of the movie.Holes is the story of Stanley Yelnats incarnated by Shia Leboeuf that was send at Camp Green Lake because he stole a pair of choes. At the camp he met Zero (kleo Thomas) and became very good friend. One day, Zero escape from the camp. Few days later, Stanley joins him and they climb the Good thump. Finally, they return to the camp to dig their last hole.Since the film is based on the book, I found that the movie was better because compared to the book; many details for each part on the book make it hard to understand.The actors were very well prepared. They were natural and felt good with their role. For example, Shia Laboeuf was 17 years old and played very good Stanley that was 13. This movie was very well prepared and many stars played on it so it' make the movie more professional and famous.Finally, Holes is a very good movie and I appreciated but I've seen better movie. For this reason I give the mark of 5/10 that is a very good mark for a movie for me.Messaad,Abdel HR: 201",Holes
286,iksermeno,Not the best but good,6,22 April 2016,"Holes is a adventure comedy-drama 2003 movie directed by Andrew Davis. with Shia Laboeuf as the leading character. the Movie was filmed in California with a budget of 20 millions us dollars.Stanley Yelnats (Shia LaBeouf), a boy who has bad luck due to a curse placed on his great- great-grandfather (Damien Luvara), is sent to Camp Green Lake, a juvenile detention camp, for a crime he did not commit. Stanley and the other boys at the camp are forced to dig 5 feet by 5 feet holes in the dirt every day. Stanley (Shia LaBeouf) eventually realizes that they are digging these holes because the Warden (Sigourney Weaver) is searching for something. As Stanley (Shia LaBeouf) continues to dig holes and meet the other boys at the camp, the narrator intertwines three separate stories to reveal why Stanley's family has a curse and what the Warden (Sigourney Weaver) is looking for.I found the music of the movie Holes very original. Every song that was played in the movie had kind of a connection with what was happening in the movie. For example the tent of the boys in the movie was ""D"" and the name of the group of the main song was ""D-tent boys"".I think the book made a better story then the movie because there's some important details that weren't in the movie. For example Stanley Yelnats IV was fat in the book and wasn't able to climb things or go places that Shia Laboeuf could in the Disney movie.Even if Holes wasn't a very good movie (personnaly) it was good movie compared to other Disney movies. I give a 6 out of 10 for the movie Holes.",Holes
287,mrwinnerperson,Too short for its own good.,7,7 June 2016,"Holes is a movie about a character named Stanley Yelnats sent to a ""camp"" called Green Lake over a pair of shoes. The problem with the movie is that it's too short for its own good. The amount of character development and depth in the original novel simply cannot fit into the 2 hour movie. Some parts are also inaccurate to the book, but that did not really affect my opinion on the movie; things are bound to be changed. However, some crucial character development, such as Stanley's drop in weight to show that he has grown stronger, have been completely ignored. The movie is not bad by any means, but it certainly could've been better, and a longer run time would have really, really helped it. I give it 7/10 because the positives outweigh the negatives. As much as I dislike some of the dropped character development, the movie still has really good production value, a really satisfying ending (in my opinion), and is definitely not completely inaccurate to the book. In all: Reading the novel before the movie is highly recommended.",Holes

I love it we all love it. I would also like to say that Sigourney Weaver is a fantastic actor and she is one of my likable actors I LOVE HER.

290,saraph-1,"This movies about a wrongly convicted boy who, though this, finds truth and uncovers his past.",9,14 December 2005,"Diggin' Up A Treasured Past  SpoilerThis was a great movie that I watched with my nephews. It was my favorite book for a long time; I have read and seen Holes so many times. I read the book for the first time in seventh grade and bought it when I found it. I have also lent it to people because it's such a great story to me. When I heard the movie was coming out I was so excited, I saw it at the movies when it first came out then bought it. One reason the movie is so great is because the director did such a great job on making the movie to be so much like the book. That's important because if you change anything, it would throw off the whole story. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who first, loved the book, and second, to people who like fun twists in stories.A reason this stories so fun, is because it's about kids who think they're all better than the next. This is very amusing to see little kids try and think they're ""all that"" when in reality, they are just making themselves look stupid. They also try to make up ""cool"" nicknames, that turn out to be quite childish, like ""Armpit"" and ""Zigzag,"" but they insist on being called by them. The things they fight about are so hilarious as well. For instance, when Stanley finds the fossil and they all thinks it's not cool except ""Armpit."" Another is X-ray, how he decided on his own that he's the leader and makes places in line for all of them. In addition to all this, something that's really amazing is that it has three different stories that all become one. This is fascinating because they are so diverse, but still so connected. The first story is all about Stanly 3rd, who was sent to a juvenile camp for a wrongfully convicted crime. While there he meets new friends and finds an old, odd relation. This was Zero. His story is with Stanley's, but he was a descendant of Stanley's great-great-grandfathers fortune teller, Madam Zeroni. In that story Elia Yelnats, Stanley's great-great-grandfather, wished to merry so Madam Zeroni helped, but in return he was to carry her up a mountain and sing to her while drinking from a stream. He was unable to merry this woman, and ran away to America leaving Madam Zeroni, so she cursed him and his descendants with bad luck. The last story that's portrayed is of Miss Katherine. She was a southern school teacher who had secretly fallen in love with a black man and kissed him; which was illegal for her lover at that time. When Trout Walker, the Wardens grandfather, found out he was furious and jealous, so he told the sheriff and the man was killed causing Miss Katherine to go crazy and become a murderer and thief. The way all of these odd stories come together is that the Warden is looking for the treasure Kissin' Kate Barlow, the outlaw teacher, had stolen from Stanley's great-grandfather, so she was having the children dig holes for her. Then the story with Zero and Stanley's family is the curse, which Stanley lifts be carrying Zero up a mountain and singing an old family song. It's quite interesting and amusing to see and have to learn as you go. This is such a great film with lots of hilarious scenes and characters. It had many stories that all intertwined to make a great plot. I think anyone would love the movie Holes and find it a fun watch with family, friends, or even alone.",Holes
